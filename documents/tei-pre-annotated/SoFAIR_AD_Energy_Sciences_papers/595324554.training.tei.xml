        <p>Nowadays, energy conversion and storage technologies are essential research topics due to the necessity of more sustainable processes. Specifically, water splitting is highly affected by slow kinetics and limited knowledge of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work envisages the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) electrocatalysts for efficient OER by a facile one-pot method. The impact of the preparation temperature (450-650 • C) of g-C 3 N 4 was assessed for the first time on water splitting processes and explained by different characterisation techniques. The unique crystal structure, surface chemistry, and electronic properties of the material prepared at 550 • C lead to a remarkable OER efficiency, with an overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope of 46.8 mV dec -1 . Interestingly, three major differences were observed when comparing the material prepared at 550 • C with those obtained at other temperatures: the reduced structural distortion, the superior composition in oxygen and the presence of terminal functional groups. Also, compared to other metalfree g-C 3 N 4 electrocatalysts reported in the literature, we achieved lower Tafel slope values without additional post-treatments or co-catalysts. Hence, for the first time a metal-free catalyst defeats benchmark IrO 2 . The prepared electrodes were stable for up to 45 h, even when increasing the applied current density to 100 mA cm -2 for 15 h. Thus, this work provides a simple route for the fabrication of highly-efficient and long-lasting electrocatalysts for a remarkable OER performance.Nowadays, energy conversion and storage technologies are essential research topics due to the necessity of more sustainable processes.

        <p>Currently, there is an increasing demand for sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies owing to the environmental pollution issues caused by fossil fuels [1,2]. Thus, research is being directed towards developing alternative sources of energy. In particular, the water splitting reaction can be a promising solution for the energy sector [3]. Electrochemical or electrocatalytic setups can be efficient to promote overall water splitting. The primary operational challenge on these systems lies on the energy-demanding and rate-limiting step of the oxygen-forming oxidation reaction [4,5].Currently, there is an increasing demand for sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies owing to the environmental pollution issues caused by fossil fuels [1,2].

        <p>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) typically shows a large energy consumption ascribed to the substantially high overpotential required and its slow kinetic mechanism due to the four-electron transfer reaction [4][5][6]. Therefore, it is imperative to prepare efficient electrocatalysts to bypass these drawbacks, on the way to attain an efficient overall water splitting reaction. The OER performance is related to the intrinsic activity of a catalyst, depending on the electrochemically active sites [4]. Several materials have been proposed for OER, such as layered doublehydroxides (LDH), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or chalcogenides and perovskites [7][8][9][10][11]. These metal-based catalysts have limitations such as the need for critical raw materials and their high processing costs [12]. Moreover, the possibility of metal leaching as a serious environmental threat hinders their applicability and industrialisation in some fields [13,14].The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) typically shows a large energy consumption ascribed to the substantially high overpotential required and its slow kinetic mechanism due to the four-electron transfer reaction [4][5][6].

        <p>Carbon-derived electrocatalysts are being intensively researched to overcome these drawbacks [15]. For instance, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 , herein labelled as CN), mainly employed in heterogeneous photocatalysis [16][17][18], has emerged as a promising material for electrocatalytic water splitting [19][20][21][22]. Thus, this material can effectively catalyse the water oxidation process with relatively low energy consumption, owing to its unique electronic structure [23]. Many works have combined CN with other metal-based materials creating bifunctional electrocatalysts [24][25][26], such as a lanthanum-strontium-titanium perovskite coupled to CN which achieved a substantially low overpotential of 62 mV at 10 mA cm -2 compared to the 178 mV of the respective bare CN material [27]. Another work combined CN with a cobalt-ferrite nanocomposite and explored the photocatalytic ability of CN, fashioning a photoanode that allowed for an OER overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm -2 under white LED illumination (in comparison to 290 mV for the same current density in dark conditions) [28].Carbon-derived electrocatalysts are being intensively researched to overcome these drawbacks [15].

        <p>As reported, CN-derived electrocatalysts are often combined with metal-based materials for increased electrochemical performance. In the present work, we synthesised several metal-free CN catalysts for the first time under different preparation temperatures and evaluated their OER performance. Hybrids of metal-free CN catalysts have been previously designed for OER to improve the overall water splitting efficiency, but their preparation procedure, which requires several synthesis stages or combination with other materials, compromises the straightforwardness, environmentally green character, and inexpensiveness of the proposed system [20]. Herein, we demonstrate the optimisation of a simple thermal preparation method to obtain CN electrocatalysts with low overpotentials (reaching as low as 355 mV at 10 mA cm -2 ) and high electrochemical efficiency (with a Tafel slope of 46.8 mV dec -1 ). Additionally, this electrocatalyst showed an outstanding stability during 45 h. Furthermore, the catalysts were exhaustively characterised to understand the implications of this simple and innovative thermal treatment on the synergy between physicochemical properties and electrocatalytic activity of these materials. This investigation is pivotal to comprehend the intrinsic chemical modifications essential to achieve an optimal CN electrocatalyst.As reported, CN-derived electrocatalysts are often combined with metal-based materials for increased electrochemical performance.

        <p>The CN materials were prepared following a procedure adapted from our previous report dealing with its use as photocatalysts [29]. Urea (CH 4 N 2 O, 99.3 %, obtained from Alfa Aesar) was employed as a precursor and heated in semi-closed quartz crucibles in a microwave muffle furnace (Phoenix, CEM Corporation). Two heating stages were carried out, the first by heating up to 450 • C at 2 • C min -1 and maintaining the temperature for 30 min. Then, the temperature was either maintained for 90 min (to prepare CN-450) or increased at 2 • C min -1 until 500, 550, 600 or 650 • C and maintained for 60 min to obtain CN-500, CN-550, CN-600 or CN-650, respectively. The resulting powders were washed with distilled water, filtered, and dried overnight.The CN materials were prepared following a procedure adapted from our previous report dealing with its use as photocatalysts [29].

        <p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at the overpotential (η 10 ) in the frequency range of 10 6 to 10 -2 Hz, with a mV sinusoidal perturbation. The double-layer capacitance (C dl ) was estimated after performing cyclic voltammograms at various scan rates (5,10,25,50,100,200, 400 and 800 mV s -1 ) and collected in the non-Faradaic potential range between 1.00 and 1.15 V vs RHE. The C dl corresponds to the slope of the absolute difference between anodic and cathodic current densities at 1.07 V vs RHE with the scan rates. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was determined by dividing the obtained C dl by the capacitance of a model catalyst with a unitary surface area (generally, 40 µF cm -2 ). The stability of the catalyst was evaluated by chronopotentiometry at constant current densities of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm -2 . All recorded potentials were converted using the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as a reference.Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 .

        <p>The morphology of the prepared materials was examined through SEM and TEM (Fig. 1). The images portrayed in Fig. 1 depict the layered composition of these materials. The compact nature of the CN nanosheets seems more evident in the case of the materials obtained at lower temperatures. Moreover, increasing the processing temperature induced a pronounced holey formation with seemingly more spaced-out layers. This distortion of the CN layers may promote a higher surface area and greater availability of redox-active sites. Additionally, as observed more easily in TEM there is a higher degree of disruption in the compact layered structure of CN with higher preparation temperatures, e.g. CN-450 and CN-500 showing intermingled lamellae-like assemblies, while CN-600 and CN-650 illustrate more fragmented sheets.The morphology of the prepared materials was examined through SEM and TEM (Fig. 1).

        <p>The crystallinity of the CN materials was investigated using XRD. The XRD patterns of the five catalytic materials are given in Fig. 2a. CN materials typically show two signals characteristic of their monomeric building blocks (the tri-s-triazine units) [30]. These two peaks are related to the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) facets and are respectively observed at around 13 • and 27 • , signalled with dashed lines in Fig. 2a, and details of the latter are shown in Table 1. Typically, a higher intensity of an XRD signal is associated with a higher degree of crystallinity of that specific plane. The augmentation of those peaks, easily observed in Fig. 2a, is directly related to the preparation temperature and is intricately connected to a stronger presence of crystal structures [31]. The crystallite size (L c ) and interlayer spacing (d) were obtained from Scherrer's equation and Bragg's law, respectively, after a Lorentzian fit of the (0 0 2) peak (Table 1). The deviation of the (0 0 2) reflection is attributed to surface modifications in the graphitic planes of CN, with the more amorphous materials showing a lower peak position. At the same time, a reduced FWHM was observed for higher temperatures, along with a decreased interlayer spacing value from 0.945 Å (CN-450) to 0.824 Å (CN-650), the latter derived from the deviated (0 0 2) reflection. The reduced d-spacing can be attributed to the rearrangement of CN nanosheets, which are formed at higher temperatures as seen by the increased crystallinity (i.e., higher intensity of the (0 0 2) reflection).The crystallinity of the CN materials was investigated using XRD.

        <p>The crystallite size is also greatly affected by the preparation temperature, as larger crystals are obtained for higher temperatures (i.e., 1.011 Å for CN-450 and 4.061 Å for CN-650). Moreover, above 550 • C, a higher number of peaks are observed in the diffractograms (Fig. 2a), which can be attributed to other crystallite particles or highly-conjugated planes in the polymeric matrix. Particularly, the peaks at 13.7, 17.4, 21.4 and 57.2 • are attributed, respectively, to the (1 1 0), (1 0 1), (1 0 1) and (0 0 4) facet orientations [32]. The appearance of these new reflections is related to a rearranged structure of the materials prepared at higher temperatures.The crystallite size is also greatly affected by the preparation temperature, as larger crystals are obtained for higher temperatures (i.e., 1.011 Å for CN-450 and 4.061 Å for CN-650).

        <p>FTIR analyses (Fig. 2b) were also performed to investigate the overall chemical structure and presence of functional groups in the materials. The prepared materials show the typical spectra of CN materials with a broad band near 3200 cm -1 attributed to -OH groups from adsorbed water and to the stretching vibration of N-H x groups; various medium intensity bands from the range between 1200 and 1600 cm -1 assigned to the molecular stretching of carbon-nitrogen bonds; and two more bands near 800 cm -1 owed to the aromatic heterocycles [33]. A higher intensity of IR bands is related to a larger availability of the corresponding molecular bonds on the materials' surface. Therefore, in Fig. 2b is possible to observe that the overall structure is maintained, but higher temperatures enable a stronger presence of graphitic planes, suggested by the stronger bands at ca. 800 cm -1 . This increased intensity can be correlated to a higher polymerisation degree [33,34].FTIR analyses (Fig. 2b) were also performed to investigate the overall chemical structure and presence of functional groups in the materials.

        <p>The most prominent peaks found at 706 ± 2 and 759 ± 9 cm -1 are attributed to triazine ring breathing modes [35], whose intensity increases with the processing temperature. Moreover, the D and G bands observed at 1235 ± 2 and 1564 ± 5 cm -1 , respectively, are commonly associated with graphitic materials [36] and their surface imperfections. The intensities of both bands increase with the preparation temperature, suggesting an increase in structural defects (D band) and crystallinity (G band). Thus, the modifications seen by Raman spectra are due to the structural changes caused by the processing temperature [37]. The intensity ratios between the D and G bands (I D /I G ) were also calculated (Fig. 2c), this ratio is related to the structural disorder in the materials [35,38], thus proportional to the number of surface defects. The ratio I D / I G typically decreases with processing temperature owing to the polymerisation process and increased graphitic structural arrangement; however, for higher temperatures, there is a decrease of sp 2 hybridised moieties and, hence, the I D /I G ratio increases [39][40][41][42]. Among the prepared materials, CN-550 has the lowest I D /I G ratio, implying a reduced level of disorder of graphitic planes, albeit the value being relatively high (I D /I G = 2.51) there is a considerable number of structural defects.The most prominent peaks found at 706 ± 2 and 759 ± 9 cm -1 are attributed to triazine ring breathing modes [35], whose intensity increases with the processing temperature.

        <p>The textural properties of the materials were investigated by performing nitrogen adsorption isotherms, presented in Fig. 3a. CN materials generally show a type IV adsorption isotherm typical of mesoporous solids (with some microporosity, as depicted from the inset of Fig. 3a), with a type H3 hysteresis related to plate-shaped pores formed by a flaky porous structure [43,44]. Pore size distribution can be observed in Fig. 3b, showing a bimodal behaviour with smaller mesopores of around 4 nm diameter and a wider mesopore distribution centred at 40 nm.The textural properties of the materials were investigated by performing nitrogen adsorption isotherms, presented in Fig. 3a.

The O and H elemental compositions observed in Fig. 4, respectively, were 7.1 and 2.3 % for CN-450 and decreased to 3.0 and 1.6 % for CN-650, while CN-550 showed the highest amount of O at 8.0 %. These variations might be due to the higher polymerisation degree and crystalline structure of the materials prepared at higher temperatures, whereas O/H impurities are removed [31].

        <p>XRD results for the (0 0 2) facet of the prepared materials: full width at half maximum (FWHM), crystallite size (L c ) and interlayer spacing (d). variation of these types of nitrogen leads to the belief that there is a conversion from one to another, meaning the loss of graphitic nitrogen is compensated by the gain of secondary nitrogen bonds [34]. This transformation may be caused from the opening of aromatic rings in the triazine structure, which creates new defects owing to the higher preparation temperature, which is in line with the results observed in Raman through the I D /I G ratio augmentation. Lastly, the oxygen signal was composed of 2 peaks (Fig. 5c): adsorbed -OH groups at 531.9 eV and carbon-oxygen bonds at 533.4 eV [45]. The contribution of the C-O and C --O groups was higher for CN-550 (36.5 %), decreasing for both lower and higher temperatures, which is inversely proportional to the contribution of the hydroxyl/water adsorption peak. Overall, there were no strong variations in peak intensity or binding energies, meaning the chemical states remained relatively identical despite the processing temperature.XRD results for the (0 0 2) facet of the prepared materials: full width at half maximum (FWHM), crystallite size (L c ) and interlayer spacing (d). variation of these types of nitrogen leads to the belief that there is a conversion from one to another, meaning the loss of graphitic nitrogen is compensated by the gain of secondary nitrogen bonds [34].

        <p>The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 6a) of the materials were measured to ascertain any changes, caused by the preparation temperature, on the chemical nature affecting the optical properties. The materials show minimal visible light absorption above 550 nm, while the maxima are reached for all materials below 390 nm. Higher preparation temperature lead to the extension of the visible light absorption range of the material prepared at 650 • C, showing a moderately high absorption at 440 nm. This enhanced radiative absorption capability is mostly attributed to the stronger presence of spaced-out aromatic heterocycles capable of retaining visible light [34,47].The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 6a) of the materials were measured to ascertain any changes, caused by the preparation temperature, on the chemical nature affecting the optical properties.

        <p>Tauc's method was used to determine the optical band gap energy levels. The values of E g (2.70, 2.64, 2.58, 2.53 and 2.47 eV vs NHE) decrease with the preparation temperature, proving that the calcination degree is altering the band structure [48]. A narrower band gap can benefit electrochemical applications since less energy is required for charge transfer; however, an overly small band gap energy might also promote faster recombination or unwanted electronic transitions to sink sites. Moreover, the elongation of the absorption spectra can also be attributed to defects associated with transition energy levels that may promote a retained exciton recombination rate and generate trapping sites to facilitate charge carrier transfer [49].Tauc's method was used to determine the optical band gap energy levels.

        <p>The PL spectra of these materials consist of four main peaks of Gaussian nature (P1-4). The higher wavelength peaks are attributed to transitions between σ* bonds to nitrogen lone pair states (P1), followed by less energetic and π* to LP (P2) and to π bonds (P3) [48,51]. The lower wavelength peak (P4) can be owed to terminal functional bonds with high electro-affinity [50,51]. The prepared materials showed a general tendency from lower to higher preparation temperature: reduced contributions of the P1 peaks and intensification of the higher wavelength P4 peaks. From CN-450 to CN-650, there is a variation from 31.5 and 15.1 % to 23.4 and 46.3 %, respectively, for the most (P1) and least (P4) energetic peaks (Figure S1). This is in agreement with the previous characterisation, as the material prepared at the highest temperature shows the most defective structure.

At an alkaline pH, the lowest OER overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 of 355 mV was achieved, while at acid and neutral pH, higher overpotentials of 370 and 720 were required, respectively. The CN-550 material showed a good electrocatalytic performance at both acidic and alkaline pH, which was expected according to previous works reported with other CN-based materials [52,53], most probably owing to the amphoteric nature of CN [29,54]. One major difference between alkaline and acidic OER is the large pre-oxidation peak centred at 1.45 V vs NHE (19 mA cm -2 ), which can be related to the electrode nature and its interaction with the reactive media [55,56]. The poor OER efficiency observed for near-neutral conditions might be caused by the system complexity derived from the possibility of occurring both alkaline and acid reaction pathways [55] and the difficulty of water electrolytic disassociation at neutral pH [57].In Fig. 7 it is possible to observe the anodic polarisation curves for the CN-550 material, following 250 CV activation cycles under alkaline, neutral, and acid environments (Fig. 7a) and using different catalyst loads on the nickel foam (Fig. 7b).

Kim thermal calcination of melamine, followed by ultrasound-assisted exfoliation and freeze-casting to covalently combine the CN with a graphene aerogel [86]. Compared to this work, the bifunctional electrocatalyst prepared by Kim et al. showed a lower overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm -2 , but a higher Tafel slope of 68 mV dec -1 [86]. Despite these optimisation techniques, our work with a simple one-pot preparation procedure yields comparable electrochemical results to those published in the literature.</p>
        <p>The values of C dl (Fig. 9a) were determined at the non-faradaic region of the polarisation curves through the slope of current density variation at different voltammogram scan rates (Figure S3). Current density variation (|Δj|) is calculated by the difference between the anodic and cathodic currents (j a -j c ) obtained at different scan rates. The value of C dl is equivalent to half of that of the slope in Fig. 9a. The intrinsic catalytic performance can be assessed by the C dl , with higher slopes being related to more active materials. Therefore, CN-550 shows a C dl value of 358.5 µF cm -2 , which is 1.9 times higher than that of the bare nickel foam electrode. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is another important parameter to investigate the OER catalytic performance. The presence of the CN catalysts substantially increased the ECSA compared to the nickel foam. The effective ECSA of CN-550 was determined to be 9.0 cm 2 , which is larger than that of the remaining materials. This could be attributed to a balance between amorphous and crystalline surfaces, along with distinct chemical characteristics that facilitate strong adherence to the nickel foam support and increased accessibility of electrochemically active sites.The values of C dl (Fig. 9a) were determined at the non-faradaic region of the polarisation curves through the slope of current density variation at different voltammogram scan rates (Figure S3).

        <p>Then, EIS studies were carried out to assess the charge transfer system at the electrode interface. An equivalent circuit model was fitted to the impedance measurements. The Nyquist plots (Fig. 9b) corroborate the improved OER rate of the CN electrocatalysts owing to the small arc radius of the fitted model, which is directly related to reduced charge transfer resistance [87]. Notably, the CN-550 depicts the shortest EIS arc, with a resistance to charge transfer (R CT ) of 1.76 Ω, correlated to its highest electrochemical OER ability.Then, EIS studies were carried out to assess the charge transfer system at the electrode interface.

        <p>The electrochemical stabilities of the CN-550 and IrO 2 catalysts were investigated by conducting chronopotentiometric measurements at 10, 50 and 100 mA cm -2 (Fig. 10). This represents a more accurate stability measurement as the typical 10 mA cm -2 tests [63,64] The overpotential outputs of the CN catalyst remained considerably stable, with a detriment smaller than 4.9 % of the initial overpotential during the continuous measurement period of 15 h at each applied current density. On the other hand, IrO 2 showed a reasonably stable activity at 10 mA cm -2 ; however, under higher current densities, the overpotential values increased significantly (around 15 % after 15 h compared to the initial value). Additionally, the chronoamperometric study for Ni foam alone shows very high overpotentials but with a solid endurance to the applied current intensities, proving its resilience as an effective support for CN immobilisation. These results indicate excellent electrochemical stability of the CN electrocatalyst, particularly when compared to the poor stability of the reference material.The electrochemical stabilities of the CN-550 and IrO 2 catalysts were investigated by conducting chronopotentiometric measurements at 10, 50 and 100 mA cm -2 (Fig. 10).

        <p>The CN-550 material was analysed after a long-term chronoamperometry experiment. Several CV cycles were performed, performed, and the results obtained after 250 cycles are portrayed in Fig. 10b, compared to the initial CV. It is possible to observe a small reduction of the pre-oxidation peak intensity, as well as a slight increase of the overpotential up to 370 mV at 10 mA cm -2 . Impedance studies were performed with the spent catalyst, depicting a small augmentation of the arc radius in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 10c). The loss of electrochemical activity can be attributed to a variety of factors. For instance, PL spectra (Fig. 10d) show a quenched intensity, which can be associated with blocked active centres that hinder electron transfer, but the same shape of the emission curve is maintained, thus suggesting that the core structure of CN-550 is preserved [88,89]. Chemical structure analyses -FTIR and XPS (Fig. 10e and Fig. 10f, respectively) -show a wide gain of oxygen-related groups, viz. the strong IR band at 3500 cm -1 of adsorbed -OH [90]and the intense O 1s XPS peak [91]. Also, the reduced intensity of IR bands in the 600 -2000 cm -1 range can be attributed to the oxygen moieties resulting from the prolonged OER assay. The used catalyst also shows the previously inexistent O KLL XPS peak, which is owed to Auger delocalised electrons derived from newly formed surface defects [49]. It is important to note that XPS is a surface-sensitive technique, and it shows that at the surface the nitrogen groups are not observed most probably due to the over-oxidation of the surface caused by the extensive OER chronoamperometry experiment. In sum, the spent material shows a slight loss of electrocatalytic activity; however, it remains fairly electrochemically-active.The CN-550 material was analysed after a long-term chronoamperometry experiment.

        <p>The g-C 3 N 4 materials prepared from the thermal polymerisation of urea showed great potential as electrocatalysts for OER, owing to their unique electronic structure and high stability. Characterisation techniques were useful in understanding the effect of the preparation temperature on the properties of the resulting CN materials and their corresponding OER performances. The specific crystalline organisation and structural arrangement (smallest I D /I G ratio from Raman spectroscopy), appropriate porosity and adequate composition in terminal functional groups (observed by elemental analysis and PL deconvolution) endowed the material treated at 550 • C (i.e., CN-550) to achieve outstanding OER results: a low overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope of 46.8 mV dec -1 . Electrochemical impedance and capacitance studies (EIS and C dl ) corroborated the electrocatalytic behaviour of this catalyst as it presented the smallest Nyquist arc and the highest double-layer capacitance. Moreover, the chronoamperometric studies showed that the fabricated CN-550 electrodes were stable under various current densities for up to 45 h. Despite this, future research should be focused on gaining deeper insights into the catalytic mechanism of g-C 3 N 4 -derived materials and on scaling-up processes.The g-C 3 N 4 materials prepared from the thermal polymerisation of urea showed great potential as electrocatalysts for OER, owing to their unique electronic structure and high stability.
