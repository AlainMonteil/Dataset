        <p>This paper investigates the long-term dynamic capacity expansion planning in the microgrids. The microgrid is supplied by various capacity resources including wind, solar, micro gas turbine, and energy storage system. The microgrid also supplies an electric vehicle charging station. The electric vehicles in the charging station work as vehicle-to-grid and they are able to send energy to the microgrid or regulate their charging time and rate. As a result, the charging station may appear as a flexible load or generating unit. The capacity expansion planning in the microgrid is performed to expand the capacity of micro turbine, solar panels, wind turbine, and battery energy storage system. This capacity expansion is performed for six-years planning horizon through long term plan. The short-term plan is simultaneously conducted to optimize the hourly operation of micro turbine, energy storage system, and electric vehicle charging station. Short-term operation of dispatchable resources reduces the planning cost to 28% and properly contributions to the long-term plan for minimizing the costs. The largest expansion is performed on wind system by 200% expansion that covers about 53% of the expansion cost. The model also needs further resources when facing the uncertainties and such reinforcement increases the cost by about 58%.This paper investigates the long-term dynamic capacity expansion planning in the microgrids.

        <p>In the generation expansion planning, the capacity of available generating units in the system is expanded and/or the new generating technologies are installed. The generation expansion planning is mathematically presented as an optimization programming and it can be expressed as linear or nonlinear optimization models [2]. This problem determines the site, technology, size, operation pattern, and installation time of new generating systems while it optimizes the objective function including various terms such as investment cost, maintenance cost, operational cost, reliability, and environmental costs [3]. This optimization programming is solved subject to security, technical, and economic constraints of the system. The main challenges facing generation expansion may be referred as integration of transmission networks and role of electricity trade, risk assessment, electric vehicles, role of optimal short-term operation on long-term planning, the mutual impacts of power and natural gas systems, energy storage systems, demand side management programs, environmental impacts, renewable energy integration, and policies-security issues [4]. The generation expansion can be integrated with energy storage systems [3]. The storage technologies shift energy over the hours or days and such operation reduces the planning cost efficiently.

        <p>The planning horizon is 6 years and the load growth and fuel price growth over the planning horizon are considered as shown in Fig. 3. All capacity resources are candidate for expansion over the planning horizon. There are some limitations on the expansion of all capacity resources.

        <p>The introduced method for capacity expansion is simulated on the given microgrid as case study. All capacity resources of the microgrid are considered as candidate for expansion. The results of the long-term plan for expansion are listed in Table 3. The model installs various capacity resources in different years of the planning horizon to cope with the load growth. The wind energy is expanded more than the solar energy since the wind energy profile is wider than the solar energy profile. As a result, microgrid can harvest more energy from the wind system and better to install more wind turbines in the microgrid. The micro turbine is also installed at the last year of the planning horizon to supply the load growth in this year. Finally, the energy storage system is expanded in different years and both power and capacity of energy storage system are expanded. Energy storage system can properly shift energy over the hours and improve the model by peak-load cutting. Therefore, the model installs more energy storage systems in the microgrid.The introduced method for capacity expansion is simulated on the given microgrid as case study.

        <p>Table 4 summarizes the annualized cost of expansion for each component and the total planning cost. All the costs are presented as equivalent annual cost. The most part of cost is covered by investment cost on wind energy. About 53% of the plan cost is related to the wind power, moreover, the large-scale micro turbine is installed at year 6 and it covers about 23% of total cost. The rest of the cost is related to the energy storage system and solar power.Table 4 summarizes the annualized cost of expansion for each component and the total planning cost.

        <p>As it was stated, the short-term operation of micro turbine and energy storage system is optimized by the proposed expansion plan in order to minimizing the investment cost on new technologies. Fig. 4 shows the operation of micro turbine at two typical years of the planning horizon (first and last years). The micro turbine only operates at hours 17-22 when the on-peak loading is occurred. At the first year, the operation is not significant because the wind and solar energy are cheaper than the micro turbine and they supply the demand. The micro turbine only produces energy at some hours to supply the shortage of energy. At the last year, the load growth is on the maximum status and the microgrid needs more power. The micro turbine therefore works on the maximum capacity to supply the demand for energy.As it was stated, the short-term operation of micro turbine and energy storage system is optimized by the proposed expansion plan in order to minimizing the investment cost on new technologies.

        <p>The exchanged power between the microgrid and the upstream network is shown by Fig. 5 under different years of the planning horizon. The traded power is limited on 180 kW because the capacity of line between the microgrid and the upstream network is 180 kW. It can be realized that the load growth in the microgrid is supplied by the available capacity resources and the new installed resources. Since the traded power between the microgrid and the upstream network is limited, the microgrid should supply the load demand (load growth) by installing proper and enough capacity resources including wind, solar, micro turbine, and energy storage system. The model not only installs new capacity resources (i.e., wind, solar, micro turbine, and energy storage system) to supply the load demand but also optimizes the operation of micro turbine and energy storage system at the same time. Fig. 6 shows the operation of energy storage system in different years of the planning horizon. This component shifts energy from the low-price hours to the high-price hours as well as shaves the peak load.The exchanged power between the microgrid and the upstream network is shown by Fig. 5 under different years of the planning horizon.

        <p>The proposed plan also optimizes the operation electric vehicle charging station. The vehicle to grid technology is adopted for the electric vehicles in the charging station. The operation of electric vehicles is optimized to make the flexible operation for charging station. One of the electric vehicles in the charging station is discussed as an example. For instance, Fig. 7 presents the electric vehicle that arrives to the charging station at hour 19 with initial energy equal to 9 kWh. The vehicle is fully charged at hours 19. Then it is discharged at hour 21 and injects power to the microgrid. It is finally fully charged at hour 21 and leaves the charging station. Such operation is optimized for all electric vehicles that arrive to the charging and allows electric vehicle charging station to inject power to the microgrid at some hours dictated by economy or technical conditions. The injected powers to the microgrid by electric vehicle charging station are listed in Table 5. The charging station usually injects power to the microgrid when the energy price is high.The proposed plan also optimizes the operation electric vehicle charging station.

        <p>By optimizing the charging process of the electric vehicles, the electric vehicle charging station appears as a flexible load on the microgrid. The vehicle to grid technology also allows the charging station to appear as a generating unit at some time intervals. In order to signifying the influence of electric vehicle charging station on the expansion plan, the model is simulated again but the vehicle to grid technology is not considered for the electric vehicles. In other words, the charging station can not inject power to the microgrid. The results for this case are listed in Table 6. The total cost of expansion is increased by about 28%. The expansion of resources is listed in Table 7. It reveals that the microgrid needs large capacity resources to cope with load growth.

The load of microgrid is supplied by cogeneration of all capacity resources. For instance, at hour 20, about 30% of the required energy is supplied by capacity resources and rest of the energy is received from the upstream grid. At this hour, the solar power is close to zero and it does not play a significant role in the microgrid.The expansion cost including and excluding the parametric uncertainty is given in Table 9.
