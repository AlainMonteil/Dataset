        <p>Deep Borehole Heat Exchangers (DBHEs) are a potentially important method of developing geothermal resources through closed-loop systems for carbon neutral, spatial heating. Past research has primarily focused on singlewell systems, with few investigating arrays of multiple DBHEs as a method of extracting more thermal energy. In this study, a series of arrays were modelled using 
            <rs type="software">OpenGeoSys</rs> software, with the aim of understanding the influence of array geometry, inter-borehole spacing and the mode of operation on the thermal performance and system efficiency. 
            <rs type="software">OpenGeoSys</rs> software is a finite-element model which solves thermal fluxes through the wellbore and surrounding rock using the dual-continuum method. Simulations were undertaken for the lifetime of an array (20 years) with modes of operation testing 1) long-term constant heat load application and 2) intermittent operation with 6 months of extraction followed by a recovery period. Results indicate geometry and mode of operation had a significant impact on inter-borehole spacing and system performance. For long term constant heat load application of 50 kW per DBHE, the minimal spacing required for line and square arrays should be 40 and 30 m. When considering intermittent operation, recovery periods allow replenishment of heat around the borehole, meaning smaller spacing can be utilised.

        <p>Internationally, there is a drive to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming by transitioning to renewable energy sources. Space heating is traditionally sourced by non-renewable, fossil fuels (typically gas) and represents a significant area for decarbonisation. Whilst a range of renewable energy sources can be developed, geothermal energy has strong potential due to its ability to provide a weather independent, constant base load of energy. Shallow borehole heat exchangers can be coupled to ground sourced heat pumps to extract heat. Typically, these deploy arrays with a u-tube configuration in shallow depths &lt;300 m (e. g. Refs. [1][2][3]), which is also defined as the regulatory boundary for the UK between shallow and deep geothermal resources by the Infrastructure Act [4]. Increased investigation is, however, occurring in DBHEs, but this is usually focused on single borehole systems (e.g., Refs. [5][6][7][8][9]).Internationally, there is a drive to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming by transitioning to renewable energy sources.

        <p>Shallow and deep borehole heat exchangers are affected by local geological, operational and engineering conditions such as thermal conductivity of cement, casing and rock, groundwater flow, flow rate etc., [8,[10][11][12][13]. The spacing and geometry of the borehole heat exchanger array can also have a significant impact with spacing ideally set to &gt;20 m in shallow settings to reduce thermal interference [14]. Similarly, in deep settings the thermal propagation of the cold front around a DBHE has been shown to be &lt; 15 m over a heating season [8] and &lt;80 m for a 25 year period of operation [15], whilst the limited studies conducted on DBHE arrays have suggested borehole spacing should be over 15 m [16,17]. Therefore, for a DBHE operating to extract heat only, without re-injecting, it is preferred, from the point of view of thermal interference, for the spacing of the array to be as large as possible. In reality, this preference will be balanced against the costs of land, lengths and inefficiencies of header pipework. In this study, simulations were undertaken to test the impact of spacing around the DBHEs, the influence of different methods of operation on DBHE spacing (i.e., intermittent v constant base load extraction) and whether the shape or design of the array has an impact on the performance.Shallow and deep borehole heat exchangers are affected by local geological, operational and engineering conditions such as thermal conductivity of cement, casing and rock, groundwater flow, flow rate etc., [8,[10][11][12][13].

        <p>The case study is based upon the real case of the Newcastle Science Central Deep Geothermal Borehole (NSCDGB). This was chosen due to: 1) the high heat flows observed in the area [18,19] which are associated to the geothermal resource concentrated within the North Pennine Batholith [20], 2) currently, there is an ex-geothermal exploration borehole for which a plan is in place to test as a potential DBHE [21], 3) there is a large amount of land that is available for drilling and 4) estimates of a single DBHE heat extraction rate over a heating season [22] suggest the resource would be unlikely to supply the building demands [23], therefore there is a theoretical opportunity for a DBHE array to be scaled. The geology consists of a Carboniferous succession of sedimentary rocks, with 1821 m penetrated by the NSCDGB [18]. In this case study, the DBHE is limited to 920 m depth as a 4.5 inch (11.43 cm) liner inserted below this depth restricts access for pipework of an acceptable hydraulic performance. The array of DBHEs were therefore, designed with identical parameters to the NSCDGB where there is data on well completion, design, geology and thermal parameters.The case study is based upon the real case of the Newcastle Science Central Deep Geothermal Borehole (NSCDGB).

        <p>In this paper, the model was developed on 
            <rs type="software">OpenGeoSys</rs> software (e. g., [13,42]) to understand the subsurface response to operation of a DBHE array for the Newcastle Helix area and adjacent buildings (Fig. 1). Long term simulations were carried out to understand the influence of borehole operation, spacing and array layout. Previous analysis on DBHE arrays has focused on a specific case study [16] and array design [17] without testing the impact of different modes of operation. Similarly, minimal research has been undertaken on the mode of operation of single DBHEs, but those who have, suggest that greater mean extraction rates over the period of operation can be supported with longer periods of recovery from horizontal DBHEs (e.g., Ref. [25]). The method of operation has not been extended to DBHE arrays. This study therefore, tests the influence of modes of operation on different array designs and spacing; specifically focusing on constant heat load operation, before comparing it with intermittent operation with periods of rest.

The finite element model utilises a 'dual-continuum' approach which treats the DBHE as a 1D discretised medium and the surrounding rock in 3D. In this study, the model uses a CXA (coaxial DBHE) configuration (Fig. 2). Fluid is circulated down the annular space before being circulated to the surface through the central pipe.

The rapid temperature decrease in the first few days highlights thermal drawdown and cooling of the borehole (Fig. 4). As highlighted in Fig. 4a andc, prior to the cooling of the borehole, there is a warming over the length of the borehole and increase in the circulation fluid at the top of the borehole at ~10 h. This is caused by the extraction of the warm fluid at the base of the DBHE during the first cycle of circulation of fluid through the annular space and central pipe. Following this, the rock adjacent to the borehole cools rapidly (Fig. 4c).Over the duration of the simulation, inlet and outlet temperatures decline with log time (Fig. 4a).

        <p>Based off the average outlet/inlet temperatures for each array (Fig. 5a) and the temperature profiles through the surrounding rock mass (Fig. 6), it appears a minimum spacing of 40 m between DBHEs is required (if 0 • C is the cut-off temperature). In reality, greater interborehole spacing will be better for minimising thermal interference. Furthermore, when considering the efficiency of the system the CSP is reduced for the 20 and 30 m scenarios (Fig. 5b), indicating more energy is required to operate the heat pump, caused by the lower outlet temperatures. Whilst a heat load of 50 kW was imposed per DBHE the building heat load supported on average per DBHE at the end of the simulation ranged from 67 to 65 kW (for 20-50 m, respectively).Based off the average outlet/inlet temperatures for each array (Fig. 5a) and the temperature profiles through the surrounding rock mass (Fig. 6), it appears a minimum spacing of 40 m between DBHEs is required (if 0 • C is the cut-off temperature).

        <p>Similarly to line arrays, the 20-30 m inter-borehole spacing resulted in fluid temperatures reducing below 0 • C by the end of operation (Fig. 8a). In contrast, however, the 40 m spacing also showed a drop in average borehole fluid inlet temperature below 0 • C before the end of the simulation. This highlights the geometry of the array results in more thermal interference between boreholes. The cooling of the system is also reflected when considering the system efficiency. At the end of the simulation the coefficient of system performance is lower for each spacing increment in comparison to that of the line array and single DBHE. At 20 years, the minimum and maximum CSP is 3.29 and 4.04, respectively for the 20 and 50 m spacing. More energy is required by the heat pump per DBHE too, due to decreased outlet temperatures with a similar building heat load per DBHE given as 70-66 kW, respectively.Similarly to line arrays, the 20-30 m inter-borehole spacing resulted in fluid temperatures reducing below 0 • C by the end of operation (Fig. 8a).

        <p>The maximum difference in temperature between inner and outer boreholes was greater than that for line arrays. Fig. 7b highlights that there is a difference in excess of 6 • C at the end of the 20 year simulation. Significant cooling occurs in the central DBHE. This is due to more DBHEs within a smaller area mining more heat from the ground, limiting the thermal replenishment. The warmest DBHE in each of the arrays was located in each corner.The maximum difference in temperature between inner and outer boreholes was greater than that for line arrays.

        <p>To test if the results on spacing and array geometry were dependent on operation of the system, the performance of different arrays under both constant heat load extraction and intermittent heat extraction with periods of recovery were compared. In reality operational cycles will have short-to-long term extraction patterns; however, in this study they were investigated using the average heat load applied to a typical heating season in the UK (6 months), followed by an equal amount of recovery in the subsurface. The different arrays were then tested and compared to see if the method of operation could enable smaller interborehole spacing dependent on the mode of operation and geometry.To test if the results on spacing and array geometry were dependent on operation of the system, the performance of different arrays under both constant heat load extraction and intermittent heat extraction with periods of recovery were compared.

        <p>Mode of operation significantly impacted the temperature of the circulation fluid within the DBHEs. For all arrays constant heat load operation resulted in a greater temperature drop in comparison to intermittent operation. Periods of recovery allow warming of the DBHEs and replenishment of the resource. For example, consider the interborehole spacing for both line and square arrays where the circulation temperature dropped below 0 • C for constant heat load extraction (i.e., 30 m for the line array and 40 m for the square array). Both the line and square arrays previously dropped to temperatures unlikely to be operable for long term extraction using a constant heat load. When implementing an intermittent source term they showed reduced cooling in the subsurface and within the DBHE for the lifetime of operation (Fig. 9). At the end of the last extraction period under intermittent operation (at 19.5 years) the inlet temperature was 5.7, 4.7 and 4.6 • C for the single DBHE, line and square arrays respectively (Table 2). The minimum temperatures of the fluid at surface level were therefore, far higher than during constant heat load operation. When identifying the minimum spacing under intermittent operation for both array geometries the 10 m (line) and 20 m (square) spacing showed circulation temperatures in the extraction period to drop below 0 • C. Therefore, the minimum spacing for line and square arrays was 20 and 30 m, respectively.Mode of operation significantly impacted the temperature of the circulation fluid within the DBHEs.

        <p>Furthermore, the amount of energy extracted during intermittent operation over the lifetime of the system in comparison to the constant heat load operation was considered. When using the same constant heat rate less energy will be extracted during intermittent operation. Therefore, further testing was undertaken such that the total energy extracted during the lifetime was equal for both modes of operation. For the single DBHE example, the constant heat load operation amount was reduced to an extraction rate of 25 kW to match the 50 kW intermittent operation total thermal energy extraction. Difference in circulation temperatures are highlighted in Fig. 10. The figure shows that the total thermal energy extracted over the year is as important as the mode of operation. When the total heat extracted is equal for constant heat load and intermittent modes, the smaller heat extraction rate imposed for constant heat load results in far less cooling of the DBHE fluid. This results in higher outlet temperatures and improved CSP. Therefore, there are benefits in applying a constant heat load over the period of operation, however, practically this may not correspond to periods of high demand and the heat extracted is more likely to contribute to demand, rather than meet it directly.Furthermore, the amount of energy extracted during intermittent operation over the lifetime of the system in comparison to the constant heat load operation was considered.

        <p>When considering constant heat load operation over the lifetime of a DBHE array, this study has shown line arrays may be more suited for operation of DBHE arrays. From a technical perspective they require reduced inter-borehole spacing and also have the benefit of taking up less surface space. In contrast, square arrays demonstrate poorer performance and increased thermal interference between each DBHE. Other studies have suggested a low minimum inter-borehole spacing (15 m) than established in this study [16,17]; however, these studies model intermittent operation only. When comparing intermittent operation (6 months extraction v 6 month recovery) with constant heat load operation it appears a reduced inter-borehole spacing can be applied. For the single DBHE, 30 m line array and 40 m square array the intermittent operation mode resulted in far higher minimum inlet and outlet temperatures in comparison to the constant heat load extraction rate. Intermittent operation allows replenishment of the heat extracted and reduced thermal drawdown, implying far smaller inter-borehole spacing can be supported. Although, when investigating the total energy extracted (i.e., constant heat load of 25 kW and intermittent at 50 kW) it appears the 25 kW constant heat load operation will improve thermal performance and system efficiency.When considering constant heat load operation over the lifetime of a DBHE array, this study has shown line arrays may be more suited for operation of DBHE arrays.

        <p>This study also has local connotations to the Newcastle Helix area where the array could theoretically be deployed. The large spacing required for both types of arrays means the spatial area required on the surface must be carefully considered before development. Prior to scaling of DBHE geothermal projects, this study has highlighted the method of operation is important to consider, with intermittent operation allowing more boreholes to be situated within the area. Furthermore, future developments may also consider the impact of incorporating a splitter if utilising the thermal energy in a heat network. When adopting a multi-DBHE system it appears theoretically the heat load of the adjacent Urban Sciences Building can be supported for the duration of the year. Zirak et al. [23] modelled the heat demand to be between 989 MWh and 792 MWh per annum, with a significant decline in demand between May and October. Therefore, assuming most of this demand occurs in 6 months one borehole operating intermittently for 6 months extraction with at a rate of 50 kW could produce 219 MWh, which would supply the building ~285 MWh of heat (over 182.5 days).This study also has local connotations to the Newcastle Helix area where the array could theoretically be deployed.

Lower fluid circulation temperatures (i. e., circulating fluid with anti-freeze) will also allow the use of borehole spacing less than the proposed "minima". • The coefficient of system performance shows high degradation when the average outlet temperature of the array drops below zero, with CSP ranging from 5.6 to 3.29 throughout the study. • For the NSCDGB the line arrays modelled have greater CSPs and require less space between DBHEs as they allow for less thermal interference in contrast to a square array. • Intermittent operation results in reduced inter-borehole spacing and is likely to allow increased heat extraction rates to be implemented on the array with increased recovery periods. • When considering the total heat extracted, performance is best when a constant heat load is applied, rather than higher heat loads over shorter time periods. This minimises thermal drawdown in the system and increases the efficiency.
