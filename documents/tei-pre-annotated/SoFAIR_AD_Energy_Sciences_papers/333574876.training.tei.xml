        <p>A novel versatile catalyst based on halloysite and zinc oxide (HNT@ZnO) was prepared and characterized. It was found that the presence of halloysite improved the UV-vis spectral absorption ability of ZnO. The hybrid was successful used as photocatalyst for the methylorange and rhodamine B degradation. In addition, after eight consecutive cycles for the methylorange photodegradation, the hybrid did not exhibit significant reduction in its photocatalytic performances confirming its stability. Based on trapping experiments and calculated energy bands we also proposed a photocatalytic mechanism. Furthermore, to evaluate the versatility of the synthetized HNT@ZnO hybrid, we used it as catalyst for biodiesel production from soybean oil, too. Also, in this case, the hybrid showed good catalytic performance and recyclability.A novel versatile catalyst based on halloysite and zinc oxide (HNT@ZnO) was prepared and characterized.

        <p>Nanomaterials in the form of solid support have been widely deployed as sustainable nanocatalysts to confront various sustainable issues in catalysis. Heterogeneous catalysts, indeed, have been widely used in chemical and petrochemical processes due to their versatility, easiness of recovery and recyclability. Among the different nanomaterials that are currently employed to this purpose, halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) possess several advantages, including high stability, resistance against organic solvents, ease of disposal or reusability and they are available in tons at low cost.Nanomaterials in the form of solid support have been widely deployed as sustainable nanocatalysts to confront various sustainable issues in catalysis.

        <p>Generally, HNTs consist of an inner lumen composed of aluminol groups and an external surface constituted by siloxane groups. Due to this peculiar chemical composition, halloysite possesses different charged surfaces: positive on the internal surface and negative in the external one in a wide pH range (Bretti et al., 2016). Halloysite has found application as nanocontainers for biologically active molecules (Massaro et al., 2018a;Massaro et al., 2018c;Massaro and Riela, 2018;Massaro et al., 2019a;Tarasova et al., 2019), adsorbent nanomaterials for wastewater decontamination (Massaro et al., 2016;Cataldo et al., 2018;Gładysz-Płaska et al., 2018), nanofiller to improve polymer performances (De Silva et al., 2018;Kumar et al., 2019;Sharma et al., 2019) and supports for catalytic species (Li et al., 2015b;Sidorenko et al., 2018;Massaro et al., 2019b;Mishra and Mukhopadhyay, 2019). In this context several metal nanoparticles have been successfully immobilized on halloysite surfaces, obtaining extremely active nanocatalysts for several organic reactions (Massaro et al., 2017;Massaro et al., 2018b).Generally, HNTs consist of an inner lumen composed of aluminol groups and an external surface constituted by siloxane groups.

        <p>Although several studies report the immobilization of metal nanoparticles on HNTs, only a limited number of reports are available in the literature on the deposition of ZnO on halloysite and most of them envisage the in situ formation of nanostructured forms of ZnO by calcination of suitable zinc salts which could result time-consuming (De Silva et al., 2015;Li et al., 2015a;Shankar et al., 2018).

        <p>It is known that pure ZnO shows an optical absorbance in the UV region exhibiting an abrupt onset of absorption at about 387 nm, which corresponds to a band gap of about 3.2 eV, which is in a good agreement with literature reports (Ma et al., 2018). By supporting the ZnO nanoparticles on HNTs, it was observed a main absorption maximum at ca. 370 nm, which corresponds to the main electronic transition from valence band to conduction band (Iqbal et al., 2018) and an absorption offset at ca. 420 nm. The band gap energy of the HNT@ZnO nanomaterial can be calculated by the Tauc plot (Figure 1d), from the x-axis intercepts of the tangent lines of the curve obtained by plotting the (h) 2 as a function of the photo energy (h) (Anandan et al., 2010). The Eg value was found to be 2.65 eV. This difference in the Eg values is probably due to the HNT presence. In particular, we hypothesize a synergistic effect between ZnO nanoparticles and HNTs which could produce an overlapping of energy levels, thus a decreasing of the conduction band minimum and an increasing of the valence band maximum.It is known that pure ZnO shows an optical absorbance in the UV region exhibiting an abrupt onset of absorption at about 387 nm, which corresponds to a band gap of about 3.2 eV, which is in a good agreement with literature reports (Ma et al., 2018).

On the contrary, with the addition of the HNT@ZnO hybrid, the photodegradation occured in few minutes. The photocatalytic efficiency was expressed as the Ct/C0 ratio over the time (Figure 3), where C0 and Ct are the concentration of the dye (M) at different irradiation time of t0 and t.First of all, the photodegradation reaction was followed in absence of ZnO nanoparticles.

        <p>On the other hand, as it is possible to observe from Figure 3b, the introduction of the HNT@ZnO nanomaterial to a MO solution, led to an increase in the reaction rate and the dye was completely degraded after only 3 min in all range of concentration of catalyst investigated. In order to compare the photocatalytic activity of the obtained material towards the two dyes, the kinetic constants were calculated by applying the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model, (Niu et al., 2015) as expressed by the following equation:On the other hand, as it is possible to observe from Figure 3b, the introduction of the HNT@ZnO nanomaterial to a MO solution, led to an increase in the reaction rate and the dye was completely degraded after only 3 min in all range of concentration of catalyst investigated.

        <p>The kinetic constants obtained are reported in Table 1. As expected, an increase in the HNT@ZnO concentration resulted in a substantial improvement in photocatalytic performances for both dyes. Furthermore, in all cases investigated the kinetic of degradation of MO is faster than that of RhB. Indeed, we found a kinetic constant ca. 16 times higher for the MO photodegradation with respect to that of the RhB by keeping the catalyst concentration constant (entries 1 and 4). By increasing the dye concentration (from 5 to 500 ppm), we observe a decrease in the kinetic constant value as a consequence of the saturation of the reactive sites on the catalyst surface (entry 6). The different behavior of the two dyes could be explained considering the chemical features of HNT. Halloysite could significantly attract the negatively charged methyl orange into the positively charged lumen through both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in its enrichment on the HNT@ZnO surface. At pH values up to 7.4, RhB mainly exists in zwitterion forms forming dimers which can partially be absorbed on the catalyst surfaces, resulting in a slower photodegradation process.The kinetic constants obtained are reported in Table 1.

        <p>TEM analyses were performed on the reused catalyst to verify its stability. Figure 4b shows S/TEM image of the catalyst recorded after eight consecutive cycles showing a ZnO nanoparticles slightly bigger in size with respect to those of fresh catalyst. By statistical analysis, it was found that the mean ZnO diameter was ca. 3.9 ± 0.8 nm. To the light of these results it is plausible to hypothesize a "release and catch" mechanism, where the ZnO nanoparticles are released in solution during the photocatalytic process and, after the reaction, they are redeposited on the solid support.TEM analyses were performed on the reused catalyst to verify its stability.

        <p>To shed some light on the probable mechanisms involved in the dye's degradation, some active species trapping experiments were performed by adding to a RhB/HNT@ZnO dispersion trapping scavengers. In particular, among the different kinds of scavengers the isopropyl alcohol (IPA), triethanolamine (TEOA) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) were chosen as model for the detection of hydroxyl radical (•OH), holes (h + ) and superoxide radical (O • ), respectively. The obtained results are showed in Figure 5. The results showed that after the addition of 1 mmol of BQ, no inhibition of the RhB photodegradation rate occurred, indicating that superoxide radical (O • ) did not dominate the photodegradation process of the HNT@ZnO catalyst. On the contrary, the photodegradation rate decreases by adding both IPA and TEOA (33% and 28%, respectively). Therefore, it is plausible to conclude that holes and hydroxyl radicals play an active role in the degradation process.To shed some light on the probable mechanisms involved in the dye's degradation, some active species trapping experiments were performed by adding to a RhB/HNT@ZnO dispersion trapping scavengers.

        <p>To confirm the experimental findings and to propose a plausible mechanism for the photocatalytic degradation of dyes in the presence of the HNT@ZnO nanomaterial, the relative energy levels of valence band maximum (VB) and conduction band minimum (CB) should be calculated since they would be significant for the redox capacity of photoinduced carriers in the photocatalytic system.

        <p>In summary, the light irradiation activates ZnO to generate strongly oxidative holes (ℎ ) in valence band and reductive electrons (𝑒 ) in conduction band. The ℎ can react with H2O forming a free radical •OH and H + , and H + subsequently react with the absorbed O2 to yield •OH, which are responsible of the dye degradation according to the trapping experiment.

        <p>Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), namely biodiesel, are a well-known renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable fuel, produced by methanolysis of triglycerides (Kim et al., 2018). Among the several catalysts employed for their production, Zinc oxide has gained great attention due to the cheap, non-toxic, thermal stable, and amphoteric properties. This latter feature is particularly valuable as it enables the application to waste lipids and highly acidic unrefined feedstocks, where esterification and transesterification processes are requested to occur simultaneously (Yan et al., 2009). However, due to the low catalytic activity of ZnObulk powder, composite materials or nanostructured forms of this oxide are usually preferred, thus imposing costly, timeconsuming, and tedious preparations of catalysts (e.g., calcination, microwave irradiation, etc.) (Niu et al., 2015).Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), namely biodiesel, are a well-known renewable, non-toxic, biodegradable fuel, produced by methanolysis of triglycerides (Kim et al., 2018).

        <p>In summary, a heterogenous and versatile catalyst based on ZnO supported on halloysite nanotubes was synthetized and characterized. S/TEM investigations on the HNT@ZnO catalyst showed a uniformly dispersed ZnO nanoparticles on the halloysite external surface with a diameter size of ca. 2.4 nm. Furthermore, UV-vis studies highlighted that the presence of halloysite decreases the energy band gap of the semi-conductor if compared to the ZnO nanoparticles bulk. The catalytic performances of the hybrid were tested in the photodegradation reaction of two organic dyes, chosen as models, namely methylorange and rhodamine B under UV light and for the biodiesel production from soybean oil. In both cases we observed a very good catalytic activity of the HNT@ZnO synthetized and a good recyclability of the system without leaching of the metal. In conclusion the new catalyst, synthetized with a simple and low cost procedure, represents a versatile system which can be used for future industrial applications.In summary, a heterogenous and versatile catalyst based on ZnO supported on halloysite nanotubes was synthetized and characterized.
