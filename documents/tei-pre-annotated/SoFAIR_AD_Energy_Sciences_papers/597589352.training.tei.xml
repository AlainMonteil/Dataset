        <p>The transition to low carbon energy systems poses challenges in terms of energy efficiency. In building refurbishment projects, efficient technologies such as smart controls and heat pumps are increasingly being used as a substitute for conventional technologies with the aim of reducing carbon emissions and determining operational energy and cost savings, together with other benefits. Measured building performance, however, often reveals a significant gap between the predicted energy use (design stage) and actual energy use (operation stage). For this reason, lean and interpretable digital twins are needed for building energy monitoring aimed at persistence of savings and continuous performance improvement. In this research, interpretable regression models are built with data at multiple temporal resolutions (monthly, daily and hourly) and seamlessly integrated with the goal of verifying the performance improvements due to Smart thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) and gas absorption heat pumps (GAHPs) as well as giving insights on the performance of the building as a whole. Further, as part of modelling research, time of week and temperature (TOWT) approach is reformulated and benchmarked against its original implementation. The case study chosen is Hale Court sheltered housing, located in the city of Portsmouth (UK). This building has been used for the field-testing of innovative technologies such as TRVs and GAHPs within the EU Horizon 2020 project THERMOSS. The results obtained are used to illustrate possible extensions of the use of energy signature modelling, highlighting implications for energy management and innovative building technologies development.The transition to low carbon energy systems poses challenges in terms of energy efficiency.

        <p>The transition to low carbon energy systems poses challenges in terms of energy efficiency. The electrification of end-uses is widely recognised as a key component for achieving complete decarbonisation [1], even though the shift of impacts [2] should not be underestimated. At the same time, the use of hydrogen as a substitute for natural gas (and other fuels) in order to achieve decarbonization goals presents a number of challenges, cost being amongst the most significant ones [3].The transition to low carbon energy systems poses challenges in terms of energy efficiency.

        <p>In general, the evaluation of the impact of energy efficiency measures has to be conducted using reliable methods, considering the relevant investments needed [4,5], and can constitute the starting point for other more in depth evaluations, using detailed calibrated simulations [6].In general, the evaluation of the impact of energy efficiency measures has to be conducted using reliable methods, considering the relevant investments needed [4,5], and can constitute the starting point for other more in depth evaluations, using detailed calibrated simulations [6].</p>
        <p>Innovative heating technologies are part of this research and gas absorption heat pumps (GAHPs) can be used as an alternative to conventional and condensing boilers. A GAHP is a thermal machine that uses natural gas combustion process as heat source to feed an absorption cycle. In the cycle, heat is subtracted from outdoor air (heat source) and released to water in the heating system (heat sink), with higher efficiency compared to a condensing boiler. GAHPs can provide similar services compared to air source heat pumps (ASHPs) but are fed by natural gas instead of electricity. Therefore, GAHP technology can be considered as an option for the replacement of condensing boilers, even though it creates a potential lock-in condition in the long-term, due to the use of fossil fuels and higher temperature heating systems.Innovative heating technologies are part of this research and gas absorption heat pumps (GAHPs) can be used as an alternative to conventional and condensing boilers.

        <p>In operation terms, GAHP performance depends on the temperature of the heat source (i.e. outdoor air temperature) and of the heat sink (i.e. water temperature in the heating system) and, while testing standards exists [7] for this technology, field testing is necessary to evaluate performance degradation (compared to data measured in standard test conditions) determined by operation at part load conditions. Recent studies have considered, in particular, the part load performance testing of GAHPs [8] and the comparison of GAHP technology [9] with other options in heating systems . The results of these studies are compared with the ones obtained in our case study. Additionally, smart heating controller, such as Smart Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs) are often reported as a promising technology, and studies indicate a certain potential [10,11], which has to be verified because it depends on multiple factors and, in particular, on operational patterns and user behaviour. In this sense, it is crucial to understand actual operation strategies to overcome the information gap [12] regarding building performance.In operation terms, GAHP performance depends on the temperature of the heat source (i.e. outdoor air temperature) and of the heat sink (i.e. water temperature in the heating system) and, while testing standards exists [7] for this technology, field testing is necessary to evaluate performance degradation (compared to data measured in standard test conditions) determined by operation at part load conditions.

        <p>The identification of operational (as well as design) issues using digital replicas of objects/processes/services is part of current research in several fields and a multiplicity of "digital twin" definitions are present across different studies [13], in which sometimes the difference between model and digital twin is blurred [14]. Further, this topic is attracting a lot of attention also in building and energy sectors [15], due to the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) tools; however, while sophisticated ML techniques such as deep learning have been effective in multiple applications [16], they lack interpretability [17], which is today an open challenge [18]. As show by Chen et al. [19] sophisticated machine learning approaches used in building energy management employ, in most of the cases, post-hoc techniques such as LIME and SHAP [20] to interpret their results, but it is very difficult to inspect the model algorithmic logic in a simple and transparent way. This represents an issue from multiple points of view, including AI/ML ethics [21] and trust by practictioners in the energy sector.The identification of operational (as well as design) issues using digital replicas of objects/processes/services is part of current research in several fields and a multiplicity of "digital twin" definitions are present across different studies [13], in which sometimes the difference between model and digital twin is blurred [14].

        <p>The case study chosen for this research is Hale Court sheltered housing development, run by Portsmouth City Council, which has been retrofitted as part of the EU Horizon 2020 project THERMOSS [22]. Hale Court development comprises 80 flats divided in two blocks, North and South, each with independent heat networks. The analysis concentrates on the North block which has been monitored before and after retrofit interventions and has been retrofitted in two steps, first with the installation of Smart TRVs and then with the installation of GAHPs. Monitored data are split into three periods, namely before retrofit, after Smart TRVs installation and after GAHPs installation and plant room upgrade. The performance before retrofit represents the baseline for the evaluation of the energy savings achieved by new technologies. Multiple models are created incrementally in an integrated workflow, where novel formulations are tested with data at monthly, daily and hourly resolution, to provide temporal scalability, while retaining (intrinsic/ante-hoc [20]) interpretability of regression-based approaches and providing insights on the performance of new technologies installed and on the building as a whole. The origin of the integrated workflow used in this research is described in Section 3, while the technical details of its implementation are specified in Section 4.The case study chosen for this research is Hale Court sheltered housing development, run by Portsmouth City Council, which has been retrofitted as part of the EU Horizon 2020 project THERMOSS [22].

        <p>Data-driven methods for energy monitoring and management must address two important issues in present and future perspectives: providing a reliable assessment of the actual impact of different technologies in terms of efficiency and enabling persistence of saving and continuous improvement of management practices, following the considerations expressed in the introduction regarding the applications of digital twins [13,15].Data-driven methods for energy monitoring and management must address two important issues in present and future perspectives: providing a reliable assessment of the actual impact of different technologies in terms of efficiency and enabling persistence of saving and continuous improvement of management practices, following the considerations expressed in the introduction regarding the applications of digital twins [13,15].</p>
        <p>For this reason, the starting point in this research are the regressionbased approaches proposed by Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) protocols at the state-of-the-art such as ASHRAE 14:2014 [23], efficiency value organization (EVO) [24], federal energy management program (FEMP) [25], whose evolution is indicated with the term Advanced M&amp;V or M&amp;V 2.0 [26]. This evolution involves the use of more sophisticated algorithms, more granular data (e.g. smart metre readings), greater accuracy and faster feedback. In this sense, the term "digital twins" is used because of their ability to reproduce actual behaviour on a dynamic basis and to provide useful analytics for the identification and solution of operation issues.For this reason, the starting point in this research are the regressionbased approaches proposed by Measurement and Verification (M&amp;V) protocols at the state-of-the-art such as ASHRAE 14:2014 [23], efficiency value organization (EVO) [24], federal energy management program (FEMP) [25], whose evolution is indicated with the term Advanced M&amp;V or M&amp;V 2.0 [26].

        <p>In this research, the regression-based approaches proposed by ASHRAE 14:2014 [23] and by ISO 50,006:2014 [27] are used as a baseline (most consolidated approaches, with typical recurring energy demand characteristics for different building types and climates), to enable a meaningful comparison of efficiency measures monitored in different periods and estimated using different types of models, which are chosen because of their characteristics, which will be illustrated later in this section. Further, all models presented in this research employ energy signatures as defined in ISO 16,346:2013 [28], i.e. they model the average power obtained by dividing the energy with respect to the amount of operating hours in the time interval considered, namely monthly, daily, hourly. This choice is based on the necessity to achieve a certain degree of temporal scalability for the models, which can be exploited also in visual analytics to compare long-term measures (low-frequency data) and short-term measures (high frequency) in a meaningful way. Indeed, regression-based approaches are widely recognized in the building energy management sector, with a variety of applications from simple and intermediate level [29] to advanced ones [30].In this research, the regression-based approaches proposed by ASHRAE 14:2014 [23] and by ISO 50,006:2014 [27] are used as a baseline (most consolidated approaches, with typical recurring energy demand characteristics for different building types and climates), to enable a meaningful comparison of efficiency measures monitored in different periods and estimated using different types of models, which are chosen because of their characteristics, which will be illustrated later in this section.

        <p>First of all, M&amp;V approaches used in building energy management are based on energy interval data (dependant variable) and on weather data (independent variables), along with other independent variables (e. g. dummy variables to model different occupancy and operational regimes, extracted from contextual information). The most important independent variable for weather normalization of energy consumption is outdoor air temperature [23,31,32] and univariate regression formulations are preferred by practitioners [33] for whole-building statistical modelling. While this approach can lead to less accurate models compared to more sophisticated techniques, it is nonetheless insightful due to its interpretability [34].First of all, M&amp;V approaches used in building energy management are based on energy interval data (dependant variable) and on weather data (independent variables), along with other independent variables (e. g. dummy variables to model different occupancy and operational regimes, extracted from contextual information).

        <p>The applicability of regression-based approaches is not limited to whole building energy monitoring, but it can be extended further with the use of additional variables, beyond outdoor air temperature which is needed for weather normalization of energy demand. In regression for co-heating tests [35,36] (building fabric performance characterisation), for example, solar radiation on horizontal surfaces is used to account for the solar gains component in the thermal energy balance of building zones, with tests lasting around 15 days on average [37]. Furthermore, differencing outdoor air temperatures in a time series with daily interval (i.e., taking differences between one day and the previous day) simplifies the quantification of the influence of the building fabric's inertia [38,39]. Additionally, heating system supply temperature is used in combination with outdoor air temperature to characterise the performance of air source heat pumps (ASHPs) for control purpose [40,41].The applicability of regression-based approaches is not limited to whole building energy monitoring, but it can be extended further with the use of additional variables, beyond outdoor air temperature which is needed for weather normalization of energy demand.

        <p>Amongst the regression-based techniques leveraging hourly interval data, time of week and temperature (TOWT) algorithm was proposed initially by Price [42] to analyse electric load shape and its variability. It has been used then for the quantification of changes in electricity use due to demand response [43] and in the context of utility scale efficiency programs [44]. 
            <rs type="software">TOWT</rs> was successfully tested as well in the advanced M&amp;V testing portal of efficiency valuation organization (EVO) [45], a portal for open and independent testing, with electricity consumption data from 367 buildings located in various regions of North America. 
            <rs type="software">TOWT</rs> is a software 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package named 
            <rs type="software">RMV</rs>
            <rs type="version">2.0</rs> [46]; in this package, a gradient boosting machine method is implemented as well [47]. However, 
            <rs type="software">TOWT</rs> is much easier to use, with only one hyper-parameter to be tuned. At present, various open software packages exists that implement 
            <rs type="software">TOWT</rs> and other regression-based techniques, namely 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package

            <rs type="software">OpenEEmeter</rs> [49] that implements 
            <rs type="software">Caltrack</rs> methods [50], or the recent 
            <rs type="software">EENSIGHT</rs> [51]. Further, extensive reviews have been developed around the problem of energy baseline modelling [52], whole-building statistical energy consumption models [33], use of physics-driven and data-driven approaches for measurement and verification in building retrofits [53,54], and more, in general, interpretable energy analytics in the construction sector [55,56]. Finally, as show by Chen et al. [19] sophisticated machine learning approaches used in building energy management employ, in most of the cases, post-hoc techniques to interpret their results such as LIME and SHAP [20]. Instead, regression-based approaches are selected for this study due to their intrinsic (ante-hoc) interpretability.

        <p>The model formulations used in this research have been developed for different applications, as indicated in Section 3, but they share a series of similarities that make them suitable for implementation in an integrated workflow, illustrated in Section 4.1. The integrated workflow starts with simple baseline regression models using energy signature as dependant variable and outdoor air temperature as independent variable, tested in the different monitoring periods reported later in Section 5. After that, the regression models are modified by means of additional variables to improve their goodness of fit. The simple baseline models are then used to test model retraining with a rolling horizon of 15 days of data and to check the outdoor air temperature response of time of week and temperature (TOWT) algorithm, which is reformulated and benchmarked against its original implementation. A regression model is used as well to characterise the performance of gas absorption heat pumps (GAHP), using an additional variable as well. Finally, criteria for model acceptability according to measurement and verification (M&amp;V) guidelines are reported in Section 4.2.The model formulations used in this research have been developed for different applications, as indicated in Section 3, but they share a series of similarities that make them suitable for implementation in an integrated workflow, illustrated in Section 4.1.

        <p>In the preparation phase, before training models, data have been processed to remove missing values using interpolation, due to the minimal gaps found in measured data. Hourly outdoor air temperature and solar radiation data collected were already sufficiently accurate for this type of applications, while natural gas half-hourly data were cleaned by using a moving average filter aimed at de-noising (e.g. removing small oscillations around the actual value that depend on measurement errors) and aggregated at hourly interval. As introduced in Section 3, the simple regression models used as baseline are derived from ASHRAE 14:2014 [23] and consider outdoor air temperature θ e as fundamental input but are then reformulated with the inclusion of additional variables. Amongst the additional variables there is total solar radiation on horizontal surface I sol and differenced daily average temperature θ e, diff (i.e. the difference between outdoor air temperature in one day and the day before) for the reasons expressed in Section 3. Further, to be able to model piecewise linear shapes, dummy variables (0-1) such as X h are used as an interaction term (i.e. multiplied by other variables θ e , I sol , θ e, diff ) following the same rules and conventions illustrated in previous research [57].In the preparation phase, before training models, data have been processed to remove missing values using interpolation, due to the minimal gaps found in measured data.

        <p>These rules involve the selection of change-point temperatures within credible ranges (change-points represent the balance-point temperatures for the building [58,59] and are a function of building characteristics and operation strategies, so they are physically constrained) and the inclusion of a constraint in model output. In fact, energy signatures are positive quantities and using a piecewise linear formulation can lead to small negative values when signature is near 0, which have to be removed. The formulations of monthly and daily energy signature models are reported in Table 2.These rules involve the selection of change-point temperatures within credible ranges (change-points represent the balance-point temperatures for the building [58,59] and are a function of building characteristics and operation strategies, so they are physically constrained) and the inclusion of a constraint in model output.

        <p>In order to assess the degree of uncertainty that may be introduced when only short-term measures are available and the risk of overfitting, baseline models are tested with incremental re-training with a 15-days rolling horizon, for the reasons discussed in Section 3. This process is similar, in principles, to a cross-validation of models, where the entire dataset is subsetted into smaller datasets with 15 days of data each, and the individual models are then compared to the original model trained on the entire set.In order to assess the degree of uncertainty that may be introduced when only short-term measures are available and the risk of overfitting, baseline models are tested with incremental re-training with a 15-days rolling horizon, for the reasons discussed in Section 3.

        <p>Moreover, additional dummy variables are used also in time of week and temperature (TOWT) approach. TOWT has been used before by the authors to model electric load profiles in highly variable conditions [60]. However, in this paper a novel formulation is proposed and benchmarked with 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package 
            <rs type="software">RMV</rs>
            <rs type="version">2.0</rs> [46] implementation. TOWT model formulation is simple in principle, as it is composed by two sub-models (piecewise linear), one for occupied L occ (high demand) and one for unoccupied L unocc (low demand) periods, as shown hereafter:
        </p>
        <p>However, due to its structure, two strategies are needed to perform the temporal (Time Of Week) and temperature segmentation. The temporal segmentation is intrinsically dependant on the temperature segmentation as occupied/unoccupied periods are identified in an automated way, considering the electric load with respect to outdoor air temperature. In this research, as explained before, we focus on energy signature of natural gas consumption q h instead of electric load.However, due to its structure, two strategies are needed to perform the temporal (Time Of Week) and temperature segmentation.

        <p>Temperature segmentation is conducted in such a way that continuity in the temperature response computed by the model is preserved, using the algorithm reported in [43]; in this way constraints are imposed "indirectly" to retain continuity, while using a conventional regression algorithm, which doesn't include constraints. Additionally, temperature response is the point of contact between the regression models in Table 2 and TOWT, as will be shown graphically in Section 6.3 by means of energy signatures.Temperature segmentation is conducted in such a way that continuity in the temperature response computed by the model is preserved, using the algorithm reported in [43]; in this way constraints are imposed "indirectly" to retain continuity, while using a conventional regression algorithm, which doesn't include constraints.

The latter provides the possibility to define temperature change-points arbitrarily as well as temperature segments with an equal amount of data points (i.e. based on quantiles of data), but keeps the same weighting approach using days as hyper-parameters, as in RMV2.0, while

        <p>In the last step of the research workflow, the GAHP performance is characterised using GUE (Gas Utilization Efficiency), which is the parameter describing its thermal conversion efficiency. GUE is defined as the ratio between the delivered thermal energy and the fuel energy (and substantially similar to the Coefficient of Performance for an electric heat pump) and gue correspond to its Part Load Fraction (PLF) as follows:In the last step of the research workflow, the GAHP performance is characterised using GUE (Gas Utilization Efficiency), which is the parameter describing its thermal conversion efficiency. GUE is defined as the ratio between the delivered thermal energy and the fuel energy (and substantially similar to the Coefficient of Performance for an electric heat pump) and gue correspond to its Part Load Fraction (PLF) as follows:</p>
        <p>where Q th and Q NG are respectively the heat output (kWh) and gas energy input (kWh) of the period under consideration, gue is the ratio between the actual GUE value in part-load conditions and the maximum value measurable in steady-state conditions (i.e. in standardized test conditions). Q th and Q NG can be expressed also in terms of power (kW), by dividing the quantity by the time interval (hours in this case). The energy content of the gas is calculated with the measured gas volume (m 3 ) and lower heating value (kWh/m 3 ). In this case, our goal is to create a simple approach to predict Q th and GUE in variable operational conditions (i.e. realistic operation), thereby obtaining a model useful for energy management purpose. First, GAHPs performance data (i.e. Q th and GUE) available from technical datasheets are interpolated using the approach explained in EN 15,316-4-2:2017 [61]. Technical data sheets report the results of steady-state test conditions at full load [7]; the gap between GUE max (determined by the regression) and the actual measured GUE is discuss later in relation to metered energy demand. The input data for the two multivariate regression models (one for Q th and one for GUE max ) are θ e outdoor air temperature ( • C) and θ sup supply temperature of the heating loop ( • C), while the output data are Q th expressed as thermal power output (kW) and GUE, defined before. The models are formulated as follows:where Q th and Q NG are respectively the heat output (kWh) and gas energy input (kWh) of the period under consideration, gue is the ratio between the actual GUE value in part-load conditions and the maximum value measurable in steady-state conditions (i.e. in standardized test conditions).

        <p>From the point of view of control, the strategy adopted is fixed point with compensation (but no-weather compensation) so the hot water temperature in the primary loop oscillates between 60 and 65 • C in operation. Such a high temperature is necessary because, as it can be seen in the scheme in Fig. 2, it has to serve both the space heating and the domestic hot water demands for the dwellings. The terminal units of heating system are radiators. The impossibility to reduce supply temperature is a major limitation to the achievement of the full efficiency potential for the heating system and GAHP technology, as will be discussed later in Section 6.4.From the point of view of control, the strategy adopted is fixed point with compensation (but no-weather compensation) so the hot water temperature in the primary loop oscillates between 60 and 65 • C in operation.

        <p>Following the application of the methods introduced in Section 4 to the case study described in Section 5, in this section multiple model implementations are discussed. In Section 6.1, regression models at the state of the art (which represent the most consolidated techniques, used for measument and verification) are used as baseline and then modified with the inclusion of additional independent variables, assessing their performance improvement. After that, in Section 6.2, the robustness of baseline models for the different periods of monitoring (reported in Table 6) is tested by re-training them with a rolling horizon of 15 days. Then, in Section 6.3 a reformulation of the Time Of Week and Temperature (TOWT) approach is proposed and benchmarked against the original formulation. Finally, the GAHP performance is characterised using regression as well in Section 6.4, providing an additional validation to the savings estimated. Overall, the results indicate how it is possible to provide an integrated workflow, starting from a simple baseline model and further research potential is described in Section 6.5.Following the application of the methods introduced in Section 4 to the case study described in Section 5, in this section multiple model implementations are discussed.

        <p>The first model tested is model θ e from Table 2 and the test is developed using natural gas demand signature as predicted variable, because the electricity demand is practically constant before and after retrofit, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 3. In this figure, there is no temperature dependence for the operation of auxiliaries, i.e. they are running practically in a constant way (on average) during the year and they are not analysed further. Nonetheless, the application of regressionbased techniques to highly variable electric load profiles has been presented in previous research [60].The first model tested is model θ e from Table 2 and the test is developed using natural gas demand signature as predicted variable, because the electricity demand is practically constant before and after retrofit, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 3.

        <p>Instead, if the slope obtained by the energy signature model fitting in Fig. 4 for natural gas demand is considered, it is possible to see how the heating system capacity installed is oversized compared to the actual needs, even when extrapolating for very low temperatures.Instead, if the slope obtained by the energy signature model fitting in Fig. 4 for natural gas demand is considered, it is possible to see how the heating system capacity installed is oversized compared to the actual needs, even when extrapolating for very low temperatures.</p>
        <p>The change-points of the piecewise linear regression model in the different monitoring periods are in the range 19.5-20.0 • C. These values are much larger than the one normally encountered in buildings [62], but there reasons behind this high value is the very high average temperatures in living rooms and bedrooms, in the range 22.9-23.5 • C. It is worth noting that the base temperatures used for the normalization of energy demand in Display Energy Certificates (DEC) is 15.5 • C and the one reported in technical standardization for the calculation of the part load ratio of heat pump operation [63] is 16 • C; both temperatures are very far from the measured one in this case and this confirms the importance of developing tailored regression models that reflect the actual behaviour of a building.The change-points of the piecewise linear regression model in the different monitoring periods are in the range 19.5-20.0 • C.

        <p>The constant part of the natural gas signature (above the changepoint temperature) represents the average demand for domestic hot water (DHW), as it corresponds to summer months when there is no heating demand and just DHW demand. In Table 8 the results of natural gas demand signature analysis are reported, indicating in general a good fit of the models in all the three periods, interpreting them in light of the thresholds of acceptability reported in Table 4, R 2 and Mean Absolute Percentage Error, MAPE. The Normalized Mean Bias Error NMBE is 0 in the cases with daily data. This is due to the fact that regression techniques tend to have a value equal to 0 because of their formulation (minimization of sum of the squares of the differences between measures and model predictions). The more relevant statistical parameter in this case is CV(RMSE), considering also the limitations of R 2 reported before in Section 4.2.The constant part of the natural gas signature (above the changepoint temperature) represents the average demand for domestic hot water (DHW), as it corresponds to summer months when there is no heating demand and just DHW demand.

        <p>From the analysis of the time series of savings and cumulative savings reported in Fig. 7, it can be seen how during the pandemic period (the last part of the monitoring period) domestic hot water usage increased, probably due to an higher demand of water for cleaning and sanification purposes. In Table 9 the calculation of the performance improvement is reported, expressed in terms of percentage of energy demand reduction compared to a baseline value in the different monitoring periods, described in more detail in Table 6.From the analysis of the time series of savings and cumulative savings reported in Fig. 7, it can be seen how during the pandemic period (the last part of the monitoring period) domestic hot water usage increased, probably due to an higher demand of water for cleaning and sanification purposes.

        <p>To obtain an appropriate comparison [27] in typical climate conditions, the energy demand as been calculated on a yearly basis, using the piecewise linear regression models developed and a standard weather data file for the location (weather normalization), considering the same domestic hot water demand of the pre-pandemic period (normalization of user behaviour). On the one hand, the impact of smart TRVs (7.2% reduction of natural gas demand) is modest but essentially in line with values found in literature, which indicates respectively a range 5-10%, determined by simulation in the UK residential context [10], and 7.1-23.3%, measured empirically in Poland with a long-term field evaluation [11]. Following the comparison with other case studies, it appears evident that the saving potential of TRVs has not been exploited completely in this case and their operational settings can be improved. This fact has been clarified by a more in depth data analysis of operational patterns conducted within the same project, which is not presented in this case as it goes beyond the scope of this paper. In general, these results confirm the need of evidence on the impact of smart controls in the residential sector [9] and an adequate consideration of their cost-benefit ratio. The energy demand reduction determined by Smart TRVs and GAHPs together is 25.8% and the relative improvement determined by GAHPs is 20.0%.

        <p>In this section, the results obtained by fitting model θ e using daily data interval are presented but, differently from Section 6.1, a rolling horizon of 15 days is chosen, following the considerations described in Section 3. The results of the series of θ e models fitted is compared to the θ e model fitted to the entire series of data and reported in Section 6.1. This modelling approach has, in principles, two main objectives. The first one is reproducing the use of regression in a "digital twin" fashion where model coefficients are periodically recomputed and model is recalibrated. The second one is performing a cross-validation of models' results for the different monitoring periods, subsetting the entire dataset into individual sets of 15 days of data, for which the variability of coefficients' estimates is analysed and the potential overfitting risk is evaluated.In this section, the results obtained by fitting model θ e using daily data interval are presented but, differently from Section 6.1, a rolling horizon of 15 days is chosen, following the considerations described in Section 3.

        <p>The daily ranges were selected with a maximum temperature of 16 • C to accurately estimate the heating dependant part of the model, despite the fact that the balance point for the building is in the range 19.5-20.0 • C (points which are near to the change-point would give more unstable estimates). Because of the possibility of exploiting its approximated physical interpretation (as in co-heating tests, for example), the slope of the regression for heating demand is analysed (parameter a 1 for the models reported in Table 2 in Section 4). The results in Table 13 show that, on average, the coefficients' estimates obtained with the daily θ e model fitted to the entire dataset are not very different from the ones obtained with rolling horizon model retraining (subsets), indicating the effectiveness of the approach.The daily ranges were selected with a maximum temperature of 16 • C to accurately estimate the heating dependant part of the model, despite the fact that the balance point for the building is in the range 19.5-20.0 • C (points which are near to the change-point would give more unstable estimates).

        <p>As indicated in Table 3, a major difference between the state-of-theart implementation of TOWT in RMV2.0 and the reformulation proposed resides in the fact that temperature is subsetted with respect to the median (i.e. 50 percentile of data) and that the width of the temperature segments is dependant on the range (min-max) of the available data (may be different in the left and right side of the temperature distribution). The alternative implementation of TOWT proposed in this research makes use of a piecewise linear function to distinguish between periods of high and low consumption, denoted as occupied and unoccupied hours in RMV2.0, which uses instead a regression with respect to Heating Degree-Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree-Days (CDD). This formulation, employing energy signature, enables the comparison between piecewise linear models in Table 2 (in this section only model θ e is considered for simplicity) and the component of TOWT model which represents the outdoor temperature dependence of load/signature. Separated signatures are fitted for periods of high consumption (flagged as occupied in the original formulation) and low consumption (flagged as unoccupied in the original formulation). As can be seen in Figs. 8, 9 and 10 on the left-hand side, for the three periods of monitoring, there is a good agreement between the piecewise linear temperature-dependant component of the TOWT and the model θ e , with some exceptions during summer when the TOWT fits better the actual conditions and in winter when temperature is low and there is reduction of the slope, compared to the simplest regression model. Overall, the model reformulation proposed fits data well and within the limits for model acceptability given by ASHRAE14:2014 and reported in Table 4.As indicated in Table 3, a major difference between the state-of-theart implementation of TOWT in RMV2.0 and the reformulation proposed resides in the fact that temperature is subsetted with respect to the median (i.e. 50 percentile of data) and that the width of the temperature segments is dependant on the range (min-max) of the available data (may be different in the left and right side of the temperature distribution).

        <p>Indeed, the scalability of energy signature visualisation as a function of outdoor air temperature enables the comparison of model estimates from monthly, to daily and hourly data, for example in Figs. 4 (monthly and daily interval) and Fig. 8-10 (hourly interval). This feature is particularly relevant if there is the necessity to compare long-term/low- frequency measures and short-term/high frequency measures in a meaningful way. Further, there are multiple insights that can be derived by interpreting energy signature slopes and change-points, as discussed in Section 3. Finally, in numerical terms, the reformulation of TOWT fits data well for the selected periods, as indicated in Table 14. In this case the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) indicator is excluded because hourly time series may have data that are near or equal to 0 (i.e. if the system is turn-off for a period of the day) and MAPE is not an appropriate indicator.Indeed, the scalability of energy signature visualisation as a function of outdoor air temperature enables the comparison of model estimates from monthly, to daily and hourly data, for example in Figs. 4 (monthly and daily interval) and Fig. 8-10 (hourly interval).

        <p>The results achieved are very similar to the ones which can be achieved with TOWT implementation in RMV2.0 with 15 days hyperparameter, as reported in Table 15, even though the weighting approach implemented in RMV2.0 determines a much larger number of model runs, reported in Table 16, in particular if the hyper-parameter is set to 1 day. In fact, the RMV2.0 implementation requires an initial run to distinguish between occupied and unoccupied hours using a degreedays model, after which the time series is segmented based on the hyper-parameter to produce a matrix of coefficients used to weight multiple regressions.The results achieved are very similar to the ones which can be achieved with TOWT implementation in RMV2.0 with 15 days hyperparameter, as reported in Table 15, even though the weighting approach implemented in RMV2.0 determines a much larger number of model runs, reported in Table 16, in particular if the hyper-parameter is set to 1 day.

        <p>Instead, the proposed reformulation requires as well one initial model run to fit the piecewise linear temperature component required to distinguish between high (i.e., occupied) and low (i.e., unoccupied) consumption hours. After that however, two model runs are required to determine the piecewise linear component for high/low consumption hours, as depicted in Figs. 8-10 on the left, and finally a single model run is required to develop a Time Of Week (TOW) model for the residuals. The residuals are differentiated by month in this case, as this is the hyper-parameter used in the new formulation proposed. The lower amount of models fitted aims to reduce clearly the computational effort but also the risk of model overfitting and limiting the number of model parameters. A weighting approach with hyper-parameters expressed in months is present in the Caltrack/OpenEEmeter [50] implementation of TOWT, which keeps however a modelling approach for temperature segmentation similar to RMV2.0 [46].Instead, the proposed reformulation requires as well one initial model run to fit the piecewise linear temperature component required to distinguish between high (i.e., occupied) and low (i.e., unoccupied) consumption hours.

        <p>The results of model predictions for Q th and GUE are then plotted in Fig. 11 (on left and right side respectively) against the calculated GAHP data, determined by means of interpolation, using data from technical datasheets. The charts indicate also the single regression lines for each supply temperature (50,55,60,65 • C) and it can be seen how the slopes are just moderately different each other; this justifies the creation of a single regression model with two input variables θ e and θ sup. The model applicability can be extended further by means of dummy variables (i.e. to handle change points and non-linearity), in analogy with the models presented in Table 2. This is not required, however, in this case.The results of model predictions for Q th and GUE are then plotted in Fig. 11 (on left and right side respectively) against the calculated GAHP data, determined by means of interpolation, using data from technical datasheets.

        <p>In a research published by Schmitt-Gehrke et al. [8] multiple types of GAHPs were tested in partial load conditions, calculating the gue, whose values range typically between 0.80-0.90 This parameter accounts for part load performance degradation and is defined similarly to Part Load Fraction (PLF) for electrical heat pumps, as explained before at the end of Section 4.1. The values found in this study are coherent with the ones found in that research. If, for the sake of verification and in a very simplistic way, the average outdoor air temperature conditions of 14 • C is assumed (for monitoring period 3) with a supply temperature in the range 60-65 • C (given the fixed point control and the absence of weather compensation) a GUE max of around 1.4 is obtained, looking at Fig. 4. Then, if a gue equal to 0.85 is considered (within the range specified above from literature focused on part load GAHP testing), the final corrected GUE is around 1.2, which is essentially compatible with the measured performance improvement achieved by the GAHP (20.0% compared to condensing boilers) because the existing condensing boilers, in these operating conditions, have an efficiency that is near to 1 (0.97-0.98, thereby a GUE of around 1.2 is compatible with a 20% savings). In this case study building in fact, condensing boilers are not working in condensing mode due to the high temperature of supply (around 60-65 • C) as reported in Section 4. Clearly, a more in depth analysis requires the correct weighting of GUE with respect to outdoor air temperature and load conditions, with a method substantially similar to the one specified in technical standardization [63,64] for the calculation of Seasonal Coefficient of Performance (SCOP) for electrical heat pumps and with the correction for part load performance in the different conditions. Nonetheless, the method presented in this research provides a quick and simple way to verify performance, that gives results similar to the ones obtained in other studies where a 10 to 15% improvement of the annual heating efficiency for GAHP with respect to other options was found [65]. This percentage of performance improvement with respect to natural gas boilers is fundamentally constrained by the supply temperature of the heating system, as can be seen from the ranges of GUE values presented in Fig. 11. In other words, in buildings with higher supply temperatures the relative performance improvement is necessarily smaller than in buildings with lower supply temperatures. This fact is important and needs to be considered when planning a retrofit intervention because optimistic assumption on GAHP performance may compromise the return of the investment, which depends on the actual energy savings achieved.In a research published by Schmitt-Gehrke et al.

        <p>Multiple areas of development are possible starting from the results presented and discussed in Section 6. The first area of improvement involves the integration of the different techniques in a seamless workflow where temporal scalability is exploited effectively. For example, using daily data it becomes possible to understand if there are particular weekly patterns (i.e. difference between operational regimes and occupancy in different days of the week, or if there is a significant difference between weekdays and weekend). Then, using hourly and sub-hourly data it become possible to characterize the building dynamic thermal behaviour and operating schedules; this can help optimise operational settings. In general, the presence of both short-term/highfrequency measurements (daily, hourly, sub-hourly) and long-term/ low-frequency ones (monthly, across multiple years) can greatly improve the robustness of the performance assessment and optimise the effort spent in the analysis process. Overall, further potential research developments are summarised in Table 18, considering the areas and specific applications. As can be seen in the table, the use of approximate physical interpretation is a relevant element which helps in setting appropriate boundaries and constraints in the modelling process, while providing a greater sense of trust in models' outputs. Further, this peculiar characteristics of interpretable methods can help bridge the current state of the art research on whole-building energy model calibration [6] by means of a multi-level process [66], where lumped physical properties are identified [67] and used in simplified physical models to optimize operation and enhance building flexibility [68] dynamically.Multiple areas of development are possible starting from the results presented and discussed in Section 6.

        <p>In this research, multiple formulations of lean and interpretable (regression-based) "digital twins" for building energy performance monitoring have been proposed. First of all, potential improvements with respect to model formulations at the state-of-the-art have been shown with the use of additional variables. Then, the robustness of models has been tested by retraining them with a 15 days rolling horizon, indicating a reasonable level of stability of models' coefficients estimates. Further, a reformulation of the time of week and temperature (TOWT) model has been proposed, which achieves good performance with an enhanced interpretability, using energy signature visualisation. Finally, GAHPs performance has been characterised using regression as well.In this research, multiple formulations of lean and interpretable (regression-based) "digital twins" for building energy performance monitoring have been proposed.

        <p>Overall, it was shown how interpretable regression-based approaches can be used effectively at multiple temporal scales of analysis and, therefore, how they can work reasonably well even with limited information such as monthly data, making them suitable for quick and inexpensive performance assessment (i.e. using utility bills and outdoor air temperatures). Nonetheless, models' performance can be improved by increasing the data granularity from monthly to daily and then to hourly/sub-hourly and by including additional variables. In particular, the use of hourly/sub-hourly data makes it possible to characterize the building dynamic thermal behaviour (e.g. outdoor air temperature response) and operating schedule (e.g. time of week model component) and this, in turn, can be used to optimize operational settings. Finally, by exploiting model temporal scalability it becomes possible to alternate short-term/high-frequency measurements (daily, hourly, sub-hourly) and long-term/low-frequency ones (monthly, across multiple years) in an optimal way.Overall, it was shown how interpretable regression-based approaches can be used effectively at multiple temporal scales of analysis and, therefore, how they can work reasonably well even with limited information such as monthly data, making them suitable for quick and inexpensive performance assessment (i.e. using utility bills and outdoor air temperatures).

        <p>In the monitoring process, energy savings were normalised by weather and operational conditions to verify them. Smart TRVs reduced energy demand by 7.2% and TRVs and GAHPs combined reduced it by 25.0%. TRVs savings were in the lower part of the expected range (5-20% see Section 3), but better system tuning could increase this value. As indicated in Section 6.4, the GAHPs' relative energy demand reduction of 20.0% is realistic given the monitoring period's operating conditions. GAHP technology may be a viable alternative to conventional and condensing boilers, but it would need to be run on hydrogen or synthetic fuels to meet low-carbon emission targets and this represents a factor of uncertainty in a future perspective. Possible research developments include both the enhancement of the modelling procedure described in this paper and its implementation in a particular set of applications. The first aspect involves the seamless incorporation of modelling techniques into a workflow that aims to provide both numerical and visual analytics through the use of forward model selection and cross-validation procedures (to enhance robustness of estimates and reduce overfitting risk). The second aspect involves the formulation of regression models based on an approximated physical interpretation (i.e. a "grey-box" approach), which can provide additional insight into the performance of the building as a whole (including supporting whole building energy model calibration), as well as construction technologies, technical systems, and operational strategies. In fact, despite the fact that these modelling strategies may be less accurate and powerful than other machine learning approaches at the state of the art, an approximate physical interpretation is relevant in light of the interpretability objective, which is also at the core of this research, because the analytics derived from models can be more easily understood in human terms, ideally promoting a greater sense of trust in the models' output.In the monitoring process, energy savings were normalised by weather and operational conditions to verify them.
