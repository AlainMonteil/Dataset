        <p>In a smart grid, efficient load management can help balance and reduce the burden on the national power grid and also minimize local operational electricity cost. Robust optimization is a technique that is increasingly used in home energy management systems, where it is applied in the scheduling of household loads through demand side control. In this work, interruptible loads and thermostatically controlled loads are analyzed to obtain optimal schedules in the presence of uncertainty. Firstly, the uncertain parameters are represented as different intervals, and then in order to control the degree of conservatism, these parameters are divided into various robustness levels. The conventional scheduling problem is transformed into a deterministic scheduling problem by translating the intervals and robustness levels into constraints. We then apply Harris' hawk optimization together with integer linear programming to further optimize the load scheduling. Cost and trade-off schemes are considered to analyze the financial consequences of several robustness levels. Results show that the proposed method is adaptable to user requirements and robust to the uncertainties.In a smart grid, efficient load management can help balance and reduce the burden on the national power grid and also minimize local operational electricity cost.

        <p>Smart grid (SG) is an advanced technology which comprises a variety of components and operations with digital communications technology enabling the energy system to pro-act, detect and react to changes in usage and numerous other events. It is integrated with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), a smart meter (SM), intelligent control system and advanced communication technologies. Load management (Shehadeh et al., 2020;Talaat et al., 2020), power system stability and control (Huang et al., 2017), monitoring of transmission lines (Mahin et al., 2020;Judge et al., 2020), and secure data transmission (Guan et al., 2017;Manzoor et al., 2018;El Mrabet et al., 2018;Manzoor et al., 2019;Beg et al., 2021) are major issues concerning SG deployment and uptake. Load management has promising impact on peak load reduction, cost minimization, load balancing and peak to average ratio. The management of power is classified as either supply side management (SSM) and demand side management (DSM). The former ensures efficient generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; this is also responsible for providing reliable energy at minimum economic cost However, our work is focused on the latter and aims to address issues in planning and monitoring activities. A key component of DSM is Demand response (DR), which encourages consumers to modify their energy consumption patterns and shift their load from peak hours to off-peak hours. Cost-sensitive consumers participate in DR by adjusting their power demand in response to time-varying prices. Domestic electrical energy usage represents a significant proportion of total electricity consumption in many nations. Across the UK, this is approximately 2/5 of the total consumption (see BEIS, 2020), with the proportion increasing in urban areas such as London. Hence, efficient residential energy consumption can reduce several grid setbacks, such as reliability matters, congestion issues, power stability problems, and power quality concerns. The idea of smart homes involves various types of energy production &amp; storage devices, information &amp; communication infrastructures, and control mechanism to adjust the energy consumption pattern automatically.

        <p>The start and finish time of washing machine which allows the users to participate in the load shifting plan where they can shift their load in an off-peak hour (Sattarpour et al., 2018). Having new developments and highly demand of pricing schemes and smart-loads, residential users find it hard to schedule these loads manually. Hence, HEMS is becoming more significant in residential sector for cost-saving, and comfortable living (Ha et al., 2012). Smart home appliances can be scheduled through the use of HEMS, optimizing the time slots of operation according to a variety of pricing schemes. Nowadays, incentives based on monetary profits are the key motives for household users to take part in home load management. Utility companies provide flexible pricing schemes like the day ahead (DA) and real-time pricing (RTP) to stimulate end-users, so that they can participate in demandside management (Corsi et al., 2020). In DA pricing scheme, the selling and buying price of electricity is known just one day before and participants can shift the loads according to the energy prices. However, the RTP pricing scheme is regarded as a reliable for power system operation because the production and consumption of electricity can be adjusted in real-time (Shahidehpour et al., 2002). Responding to the different pricing schemes, HEMS effectively decreases home electricity bills and improves household load's energy consumption profiles under considering the comfort requirements (Hosseini et al., 2018;Javadi et al., 2020). In addition, water heater (WH) and air conditioner (AC) are regarded as well befitted for load management, because of their large nominal power ratings (Kepplinger et al., 2015). Hence, the scheduling strategies of WH and AC are important in HEMS to assist the endusers, so that they can automatically receive optimal scheduling pattern. With such knowledge, numerous worthy works have been done on WH and AC load scheduling.The start and finish time of washing machine which allows the users to participate in the load shifting plan where they can shift their load in an off-peak hour (Sattarpour et al., 2018).

        <p>In Goh and Apt (2004), authors studied three customer strategies for WH scheduling under a dynamic pricing scheme, including timely interruption of power, double period setback timer, and price-sensitive thermostat. Further, they analyzed a group of situations with various set points of water temperature to investigate the relevance of electricity price with the setpoints. One of the most crucial parts of HEMS is the scheduling of household loads (Gonçalves et al., 2019;Lu et al., 2020). Most of the research community focuses on deterministic optimization techniques for household load management. In Pipattanasomporn et al. (2012), the authors proposed an algorithm for HEMS to optimal schedule the home appliances by considering customer's preference. Meanwhile, they addressed the consequences of various energy demand limit levels on demand response potential. Home scheduling frameworks based on energy consumption pattern proposed in Mohsenian- Rad and Leon-Garcia (2010). Further, they presented a trade-off between energy price and waiting time. In that work, an Inclined block rate combined with realtime price is employed as a pricing scheme. To forecast the electricity price in real-time, the authors developed a prediction filter by allowing various coefficients to electricity costs on past days. Consumers firstly set five different values to desired energy services in Pedrasa et al. (2010) so that their performance can differentiate. Later, a particle swarm optimization was proposed to obtain an effective operation schedule for distributed energy resources (DERs).In Goh and Apt (2004), authors studied three customer strategies for WH scheduling under a dynamic pricing scheme, including timely interruption of power, double period setback timer, and price-sensitive thermostat.

        <p>Many types of uncertainties like model uncertainties, communication uncertainties, measurement and forecast uncertainties, should be considered in a real condition; therefore, research on domestic load scheduling has become crucial. Pedrasa et al. proposed a modern framework for resource management for smart house including non-controllable and controllable loads and domestically available renewable energy resources (Rad and Barforoushi, 2020). That paper also considered the uncertainties of renewable energy resources, market rate, and non-controllable loads. A Markov chain and multi-layer perceptron are applied to forecast renewable energy generation. Results illustrate that the proposed method reduces both user costs and peak to average ratio.

        <p>A late-night charging of electric vehicles in distribution networks is proposed in Sun et al. (2020) for robust, cost-efficient, and day-ahead scheduling in a stochastic environment. The stochastic environment takes many uncertainties such as stochastic everyday trip distances, arrival and exit times. The simulation results tell the impact of uncertainty and the effectiveness of discussing features of risk through optimization. In this Wang et al.

A robust optimization scheduling model is proposed for DERs by combinedly consider both uncertainties of renewable energy generations and user's responsiveness. Case studies illustrate that the proposed model can decrease the bidding and scheduling expenses to achieve a higher profit. A hybrid robust-stochastic optimization is proposed to handle the uncertain optimization of smart HEMS (Akbari-Dibavar et al., 2020).

        <p>In the literature, extra information is needed to include in domestic load scheduling to convert uncertain load optimization into certain load optimization like the probability distribution and fuzzy membership function in stochastic programming and fuzzy programming. However, the extra information will make the optimization more difficult to some degree. Besides, both fuzzy membership and the probability distribution function depends on historical information. In such condition, it is difficult to collect new house data.In the literature, extra information is needed to include in domestic load scheduling to convert uncertain load optimization into certain load optimization like the probability distribution and fuzzy membership function in stochastic programming and fuzzy programming.

        <p>A robust optimization performs well in a problem where some level of uncertainties exists. Its assessment and analysis are compact enough and does not require any further auxiliary variables. Random parameters in a robust optimization are represented as a set of uncertainty, unlike stochastic programming employing the probability distribution. Generally, in robust optimization, the optimization problem is formulated in such a way that gives the optimum solution for a worst-case scenario so that any random parameters can take from an established set of uncertainty. Furthermore, robust optimization assumes a ''hard'' constraint. For instance, any violation of constraint is not permitted for any data realization in the set of uncertainties. It works remarkably due to its computational tractability for various forms of sets of uncertainty and types of problems.A robust optimization performs well in a problem where some level of uncertainties exists.

        <p>In this work, we have considered two type of loads namely, time-shiftable and thermostatically controlled loads. Timeshiftable loads can delay their operation to some other time slot in response to the varying pricing signal. These loads include dish washer (DW), washing machine (WM) and dryer machine (DM). Operational priorities of these loads are also taken into consideration as shown in Tables 123. Thermostatically controlled loads are those that perform temperature control operation to adjust heat energy and get the desired output temperature. Parameters of thermostatically controlled loads are provided in Table 4. Thermostatically controlled loads include WH and AC which are modeled under uncertain conditions. The uncertain parameters of WH and AC are represented as an interval numbers. Further, these parameters associate uncertainties into various robust levels. The WH and AC load scheduling problems are re-modeled under several robust-levels, and their constraints are transformed into an equivalent form for solving. The experimental results validate the robustness of proposed optimization technique for getting a feasible scheme that could meet the user's comfort zone despite uncertainties. Having diverse consumers' needs, and the balance between comfort and costs of the schemes with several robust levels are explained to give more options to users.

Then HEMS schedules the appliances at optimal time slots by taking the directions from inside installed algorithm (Wang et al., 2015b). In this paper, uncertainties associated with hot water demand for daily use and ambient temperature are taken into account.
