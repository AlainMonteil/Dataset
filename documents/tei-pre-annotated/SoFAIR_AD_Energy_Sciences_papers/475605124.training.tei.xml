        <p>The novel proposed cooker integrated with NPCM (MgAl2O4/Ni/Fe2O3-PCM) was experimentally developed and its performance was evaluated using fuzzy logic and Cramer's rules, and image processing techniques. The results indicated that the implementation of a bar plate absorber coated with MgAl2O4/Ni-doped, Fe2O3 nanoparticles, and integrated with PCM increases the cooker's internal temperature up to 164.12°C. The used nanocomposite materials were in the average particle size of 20 µm. The cooking materials were verified with the temperature in the segmentation process. The NPCM indicated the SBC's thermal performance enhancement of 11% in comparison with the SBC with PCM and without NPCM. Additionally, the overall thermal performance of SBCs without NPCM, with PCM, and with NPCM was obtained as 24. 90-33.90%, 24.77-45.20%, and 31.77-56.21%, respectively. Moreover, the temperature of the bar plate absorber was achieved as 163.74°C, 147°C, and 113.34°C for the SBC with NPCM, PCM, and without NPCM, respectively, under the solar radiation of 1,037 W/m 2 .The novel proposed cooker integrated with NPCM (MgAl2O4/Ni/Fe2O3-PCM) was experimentally developed and its performance was evaluated using fuzzy logic and Cramer's rules, and image processing techniques.

        <p>Cooking is extremely important for human life but it depends on fossil fuels in a way that most cookers are powered by burning conventional solid fuels like coal, wood, kerosene, etc., which are polluting and bring several health risks for the users [1][2][3]. Hence, clean cooking must be expanded drastically and promoted particularly to the isolated regions to hamper further premature deaths. Although many developments have been made, there is still a significant demand for clean cooking so that in 2020, the number of people that suffered from the lack of cooking facilities with no pollutants was 71% of the total population in Africa, 44% in Asia, 11% in Central and South America [4,5]. Additionally, in most of the regions around the world with low access to conventional fuels as the primary energy source, the potential of solar energy is relatively high, highlighting the importance of using solar energy as an alternative energy source [6][7][8]. In this regard, solar-powered cooking, as one of the low-tech applications of solar energy can be employed as a sustainable cooking facility to provide food for needy communities. In a typical solar cooker, heat is trapped inside an enclosure where the internal air temperature may reach nearly 200 o C [9] that would be sufficient to cook or bake foodstuffs. modifications in the solar cooker as a combination with a dryer [19], integration with a parabolic trough [20], utilization of Fresnel lens with a cavity receiver [10], and incorporation with an evacuated tube [21] have also documented in the literature.Cooking is extremely important for human life but it depends on fossil fuels in a way that most cookers are powered by burning conventional solid fuels like coal, wood, kerosene, etc., which are polluting and bring several health risks for the users [1][2][3].

        <p>In the solar box-type cooker (SBC) as the most studied design, researchers have presented significant developments. Mahavar et al. [22] studied an SBC to find the optimum load values where the desired range was found to be 1.2 to 1.6 kg of food material. In another attempt, Farooqui [23] proposed a powerless tracking mechanism to be incorporated with the SBCs.In the solar box-type cooker (SBC) as the most studied design, researchers have presented significant developments.

        <p>The tracking system operated within 6 h using no external power while being powered by potential energy stored in a water container assisted with springs. A novel hybrid solar cooker consisting of photovoltaic (PV) panels to provide extra heat via direct current (DC) heaters was developed and compared to a simple solar cooker by Joshi and Jani [24]. The results revealed that the efficiency of the modified box-type cooker can be enhanced to reach 38%, while the cooking time is reduced compared with conventional methods. Harmim et al. [25] evaluated the influence of a finned absorber on the efficiency of a box-type cooker, where results demonstrated that the proposed modification increases the stagnation temperature by 7% and decreases the time required to boil the water by 12%. The integration of an electric backup unit with a SBC was also studied by Mahavar et al. [26] to facilitate the deployment of this technology despite its dependency on weather conditions. Test data suggested that this hybrid system can cook 1.2 kg of food material for 100 min on a cloudy day. The electric backup contribution was only 0.12 kWh and 82% lower than the conventional electric heater.The tracking system operated within 6 h using no external power while being powered by potential energy stored in a water container assisted with springs.

        <p>The implementation of reflector panels has also been reported as one of the promising techniques used in SBCs to enhance their performance. In this case, Harmim et al. [27] developed a building-integrated solar cooker using compound parabolic (CPC) reflectors, where 78.9 W of the cooking power was obtained, reaching a maximum temperature of 166 °C. Furthermore, Guidara et al. [28] used four outer reflectors to improve a SBC's performance and reported that cooking times for rice and beans are 72 and 107 min, respectively. Weldu et al. [29] reported that tracking reflectors can increase the cooker thermal efficiency by 9.6% compared to fixed reflecting mirrors. The utilization of an aluminum receiver instead of stainless steel would improve thermal efficiency by 15.4%. Additional enhancement techniques have been introduced by scientists to improve the performance of SBCs which can be found in Refs. [30,31].The implementation of reflector panels has also been reported as one of the promising techniques used in SBCs to enhance their performance. In this case, Harmim et al.

        <p>One of the major drawbacks of SBCs is the short length of the time for an effective operation since the desired efficiency is obtained only in specific periods in the day. The researchers have also suggested a variety of thermal storage units to improve the thermal efficiency of solar cookers. They have used different mediums including salt (53 wt% KNO3, 40 wt% NaNO2, 7 wt% NaNO3) [32], Bayburt stone [33], pentaerythritol [34], galactitol [35], technical grade paraffin and erythritol [36], magnesium chloride hexahydrate [37], acetamide and stearic acid [38]. Bhave and Kale [39] showed that the use of phase change material (PCM) allows a modified solar cooker. It took about 110 min for the cooker under indoor climate conditions to provide frying temperatures of 170-180 o C for the oil. The tested items revealed that the frying time for 250 g potato chips is 17 min, while rice takes 20 min to be cooked in each batch. In another attempt conducted by Geddam et al. [40], a finned SBC coupled with paraffin as the PCM was numerically investigated. Results demonstrated that the fined structure increases the heat transfer and reduces cooking time, while PCM brings consecutive cooking and keeps foodstuffs hot for 3-4 h.One of the major drawbacks of SBCs is the short length of the time for an effective operation since the desired efficiency is obtained only in specific periods in the day.

        <p>The integration of selective surface showed benefits for SBCs where Cuce [41] presented a novel micro/nanoporous absorber for a cylindrical solar cooker. It showed a significant improvement in the absorber temperature and the air temperature as 24.1 o C and 42.8 o C, respectively. Ghosh et al. [42] tested a SBC incorporated with a glass cover coated with antimony doped indium oxide (IAO) to reduce emissivity and increase thermal insulation.The integration of selective surface showed benefits for SBCs where Cuce [41] presented a novel micro/nanoporous absorber for a cylindrical solar cooker.

        <p>In this study, a thorough investigation has been conducted on three SBCs as SBC with PCM, with NPCM, and without NPCM (also known as the conventional solar cooker (CSC)) to improve the internal heat transfers resulting in higher heat generation. In this regard, synthesis and characteristics of MgAl2O4/Ni-doped, Fe2O3 nanomaterials, and PCM (waste cooking oil and C4H4O3) suitable for use in solar cookers have been studied and analyzed. A simulation model was also developed using intelligent fuzzy logic and Cramer's rule where parameters of the temperature of glass covers (1 and 2), the temperature of the bar plate, the stuffiness of the cooked food, and the internal air temperature of the cooker were verified with experimental data.

        <p>A layout of three designs of the same SBCs (i) with NPCM, (ii) with PCM, and (iii) without NPCM (CSC) are depicted in Fig. 1(a).

To increase solar energy absorption by the SBC as demonstrated by Algifri and Al-Towaie [50], two glass sheets with 4 mm thickness and a 0.02 m gap were used to form a 1 m 2 aperture area. The cooker structure was made of plywood because of its low fabrication costs, higher availability, improved solidity, and sufficient endurance under test conditions. In this regard, five plywood surfaces with 0.025 m thickness were used to form the cooker structure with outer dimensions of 1.10 × 1.10 m with a height of 0.30 m (front side) and 0.35 m (outer-back wall).A layout of three designs of the same SBCs (i) with NPCM, (ii) with PCM, and (iii) without NPCM (CSC) are depicted in Fig. 1(a).

        <p>Inside the cooker, an aluminum cylindrical cooking vessel with a lid diameter of 0.18 m and a height of 0.20 m placed over the absorber plate with a 0.05 m gap beneath the glass cover. The bar plate absorber was also fixed at the bottom of the cooker with 0.05 m height to make enough PCM space installation. Although Algifri and Al-Towaie [50] suggested an aluminum absorber plate in their work, in the presented work, the copper sheet was selected and used due to its higher resistance to corrosion, flexibility, elasticity, hygienic, and smoothness features. The absorber plate was coated with MgAl2O4/Ni-doped, Fe2O3. Measuring all parameters including solar radiation, ambient temperature, and wind speed were carried out in 30 minutes. this study where the wind speed (m/s) was measured using an anemometer (WSSw/AVO) with a testing range of 0.5-50 m/s.

        <p>A bar plate absorber was fixed at the bottom side of the cooker and the PCM was integrated with the cooker through the coiled copper pipe with an inner diameter of 1.5 mm. The lower copper coils (at the bottom side) were filled with 3,000 g PCM composed of waste cooking oil and stearic acid (C4H4O3). The bar plate was fixed inside the solar cooker and below ten copper pipes. It was placed inside 1,500 g of PCM to support the cooker (Fig. 2b (A) -NPCM). The main benefits of the proposed PCM are high specific heat, improved chemical stability, reversible freeze-melt cycle, low cost, large-scale availability, and high compatibility with NPCM. The effectiveness of PCM integration for solar cookers was tested under both loaded and unloaded conditions. It was shown that the mixture of C4H4O3 and waste cooking oil (PCM) has a considerable capability to store thermal energy in a long-time process, where the absorber's temperature remains constant during the operating time. The mixture of C4H4O3 and waste cooking oil as the PCM intensifies the natural convection heat transfer. In this way, the solar energy is absorbed by cookers where the heat flow is from the absorber plate to the PCM until it reaches the melting point. When the PCM melts, the cooker absorbs excess thermal energy which is stored as sensible heat. The NPCM employs the latent heat of C4H4O3 and the waste cooking oil (PCM) to increase the absorbtion of solar radiation. Therefore, the PCM brings an additional thermal power source in nocturnal operations or cloudy and cold periods when solar radiation is not available or sufficient [52]. The amount of thermal energy absorbed by the bar plate absorber and is stored in the PCM (𝑄 𝑝𝑐𝑚-𝑏𝑝 ) can be obtained as:A bar plate absorber was fixed at the bottom side of the cooker and the PCM was integrated with the cooker through the coiled copper pipe with an inner diameter of 1.5 mm.

        <p>The mixture of C4H4O3 and waste cooking oil (PCM) improved viscosity and maintained a temperature of 50°C for the system. The thermal energy storage at the temperature of 137°C by the PCM was reported by Oturanç et al. [53] and Buddhi et al. [54]. The cooking waste oil was collected from the Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation (KLEF) hostel in March 2019, with thermo-physical characteristics presented in Table 2.

        <p>Since the PCM-based thermal energy systems utilize the latent heat from melting or freezing phenomena, the energy stored by the solid to liquid phase change is at least 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of stored through sensible heat storage with a 10°C temperature difference. During the phase change process, the PCM can absorb the coming heat while its temperature remains steady for a while. Thus, the energy gained by C4H4O3 and waste cooking oil is in the forms of the latent heat of fusion from solid to liquid. The high values of fusion latent heat indicate that the proposed PCM could store a considerable amount of heat through the phase transition while its temperature remains constant near the melting point. As a result, this system can be a good option when short-time cooking applications are considered. Table 1 summarizes the PCM properties in the same procedure reported by Jin and Zhang [55].

        <p>In this study, three SBCs with PCM, with NPCM, and without NPCM were developed and their performance was experimentally and theoretically evaluated. The boiled rice food's thermal images were verified in both Cramer's and fuzzy rules. The sufficient internal heat transfer to the bottom sides, bar plate absorber, sidewalls, and the whole cooker were also investigated theoretically and experimentally. Further analysis may reveal the relationships between the characteristics in thermal images of the grain quality and digestibility.

The proposed cooker was evaluated under the real cooking conditions for rice and the thermal image processing technique was used which was verified with segmentation rules in fuzzy logic rules. Therefore, the image processing was carried out based on the rules with suitable input and output values of black and yellow edge detection in rice food images. The performance of the NPCM is shown in Table 5, where the boiled items are eggs, beans, rice, and yam potatoes.
