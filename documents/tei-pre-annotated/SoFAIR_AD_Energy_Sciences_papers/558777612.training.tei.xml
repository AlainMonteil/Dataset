        <p>In this work anaerobic heterogeneous photocatalytic solar/UV light reforming of glycerol in aqueous media was performed with Pt-photodeposition and noble metal free modified TiO2 photocatalysts prepared through ball milling, a very simple and cheap coupled catalyst preparation method. Different amounts of Cu2O or 3% CuO were loaded on TiO2 using ball milling and during each run glycerol conversion, hydrogen and CO2 formed in the gas phase and 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and glyceraldehyde (GA) in the liquid phase were determined. The results were compared with the aim to verify the effectiveness of Cu2O in replacing Pt. Using noble metal free photocatalysts, 33% glycerol conversion, 10.3% and 5.4% selectivity towards DHA and GA, respectively, a CO2 concentration of 0.16 mM, and a H2 concentration of 1.01 mM corresponding to 0.17 mmol h -1 g -1 were obtained. Ex situ photoelectrochemical characterization confirmed the formation of a heterostructure between TiO2 and copper oxide and the effectiveness of Cu2O towards H2 formation.In this work anaerobic heterogeneous photocatalytic solar/UV light reforming of glycerol in aqueous media was performed with Pt-photodeposition and noble metal free modified TiO2 photocatalysts prepared through ball milling, a very simple and cheap coupled catalyst preparation method.

        <p>Regarding the photocatalysts studied for glycerol reforming, TiO2 has aroused great interest as an anodic site for substrate oxidation because it is an abundant, cheap and non-toxic material, which shows good thermal-and photo-stability [13]. As cathodic site, responsible for H2 evolution, a noble metal like platinum has been often used [14][15][16] and today few cheap alternatives with activities comparable to noble metals can be found in literature [17][18][19][20][21]. Mandari et al. synthetized onto the surface of titania particles CuO and Cu3(PO4)2 clusters as promising photo-catalyst for the production of high quantities of H2 from glycerolwater solutions [22].

        <p>The use of Cu2O is particular interesting because it presents different advantages as low toxicity, low cost, low band gap (2.0-2.2 eV) and conduction band energy suitable for H + reduction [23]. The major drawback of this oxide is the instability of Cu + in the presence of humidity and light; one possible approach to improve its stability is to slow down the charge recombination by coupling it with other semiconductors [23][24][25].The use of Cu2O is particular interesting because it presents different advantages as low toxicity, low cost, low band gap (2.0-2.2 eV) and conduction band energy suitable for H + reduction [23].

A close inspection of the 2θ=25.3° peak of anatase (Figure 1b) reveals a slight shift to lower angles for the sample Pt-(3%Cu2O P25). For TiO2 samples doped with metal species having an ionic radius similar to that of the Ti 4+ , the shift was attributed to the reticular deformation resulting from the insertion of the metal ion in a substitutional position [28,29].

The obtained values are reported in Table 1. Commercial P25 displays a band-gap values of 3.14 eV typical of the anatase-rutile mixture; the deposition of Pt does not modify the value but increases the absorption in the visible region (Figure 3). The band gap of commercial Cu2O is 1.99 eV, in accordance with the literature [25,34] whilst it was not possible to measure the value for CuO due to the high absorption over all the measured wavelengths range (Figure 3).

        <p>All the samples are formed by aggregates of irregular spherical small particles, lower than 500 nm, confirming the high surface area of the powders. No substantial variations are observed when comparing Figures 4a and4b indicating that the ball milling treatment did not induce any aggregation of particles, probably due to the mild experimental conditions (rotation speed = 150 rpm). Furthermore, the Cu2O particles are not distinguishable, confirming their high degree of dispersion within the TiO2 mass.All the samples are formed by aggregates of irregular spherical small particles, lower than 500 nm, confirming the high surface area of the powders.

The latter is defined as the measured photocurrent corrected for the efficiency of the lamp monochromator system, which in turn is proportional to the light absorption coefficient for hν values near the band gap. As disclosed in Figure 5 (see inset) the optical band gaps of all the photocatalysts are estimated by extrapolating to zero the (Qph hν) 0.5 vs hν plots. For P25 Eg of 3.15 eV was determined, while for 3%Cu2O P25 and 3%CuO P25 a slightly lower band gap of 3.0 eV was estimated that can be attributed to the presence of copper oxide particles. Indeed, photocurrent at photon energy lower than the band gap of P25 is measured due to optical transitions, therefore the presence of copper oxides induces a redshift of the light absorption threshold in agreement with the experimental findings obtained by DRS. Moreover, these experimental results confirm that TiO2/Cu2O and TiO2/CuO junctions are stable in aqueous solution.where hν is the photon energy and Qph is the photocurrent yield.

        <p>In the presence of bare P25 no hydrogen formation was observed, then two different strategies have been used: the photodeposition of Pt, as it is the most active metal towards H2 formation, and the coupling with Cu2O, with the aim to replace the noble metal with a less expensive and dangerous species.In the presence of bare P25 no hydrogen formation was observed, then two different strategies have been used: the photodeposition of Pt, as it is the most active metal towards H2 formation, and the coupling with Cu2O, with the aim to replace the noble metal with a less expensive and dangerous species.</p>
        <p>Pt-P25 was effective in the oxidation of glycerol with a conversion of 40.6 % after 5 h of irradiation and DHA selectivity of 11.4 %, and no GA was formed in the liquid phase. The maximum H2 amount was 0.99 mM with an average production rate of 0.17 mmol h -1 g -1 . By considering the coupled systems, first the effect of the weight ratio between Cu2O and P25 was studied. All the samples showed both a good oxidant activity and H2 formation capability demonstrating that Cu2O is an excellent substitute for Pt. By increasing the amount of Cu2O from 2 to 4%, the activity first increased and then decreased, being 3% Cu2O P25 the best sample. In the presence of this photocatalyst, approximately, the same amounts of CO2 and H2 as those obtained with Pt-P25 were produced with a glycerol conversion of ca. 33%. In the presence of Cu2O also GA was formed due probably to the different surface properties with respect to pristine P25. With the aim to increase the catalysts performance and investigate the role of cuprous oxide, other samples were studied. By coupling P25 with 3%Pt-Cu2O a decrease in the photoactivity with respect to 3% Cu2O P25 was observed probably due to the Cu + photocorrosion under irradiation when in close contact with Pt [30].Pt-P25 was effective in the oxidation of glycerol with a conversion of 40.6 % after 5 h of irradiation and DHA selectivity of 11.4 %, and no GA was formed in the liquid phase.

        <p>In the presence of the sample obtained after photodeposition of Pt onto the 3% Cu2O P25 composite, the same photoactivity of this latter was obtained confirming that Pt Cu2O plays the same role as Pt. On the contrary, by coupling CuO with P25 (3% CuO P25), a significant decrease in activity was obtained compared to 3% Cu2O P25. This finding is ascribable to the position of the edge of the conduction band of CuO which, being less negative than that of TiO2, is energetically less favorable than that of Cu2O towards the production of H2. The conduction band edge of CuO is, in fact, very near to the H + /H2 reduction potential [36,37].In the presence of the sample obtained after photodeposition of Pt onto the 3% Cu2O P25 composite, the same photoactivity of this latter was obtained confirming that Pt Cu2O plays the same role as Pt.

        <p>On the contrary, the conduction band edge of Cu2O is more negative than that of TiO2 so that the photogenerated electrons are more effective to reduce H + to H2 [24,38,39]. In Figure 6 b) curve of H2 production versus reaction time shows a peak of 0.37 mmol h -1 g - 1 after one hour and a decrease to 0.17 mmol h -1 g -1 after five hours of reaction time because of the asymptotic H2 concentration and the increasing reaction time. This can be probably due to the contemporary formation of little amount of O2 deriving from water splitting. The competition of oxygen with H + for electrons and the occurrence of the back reaction between H2 and O2 decrease the H2 evolution rate [15]. To verify the stability of the 3% Cu2O P25 photocatalyst, it was recovered from the reaction mixture at the end of the run and reused.On the contrary, the conduction band edge of Cu2O is more negative than that of TiO2 so that the photogenerated electrons are more effective to reduce H + to H2 [24,38,39].

        <p>A good photostability was observed, but a decrease of ca. 10% in the H2 formation was noticed, ascribable to a reduction of a little percentage of Cu + into metallic copper [21]. A run was performed with the 3% Cu2O P25 sample in pure water. A low quantity of hydrogen was obtained by water splitting, confirming the positive effect of a sacrificial agent on the production of H2 with the further advantage of using the holes for the formation of The photoactivity of the Pt P25 and 3% Cu2O P25 samples was compared also under simulated solar light irradiation (Figure 7). Even in this case cuprous oxide had a beneficial effect both towards the partial oxidation compounds and H2 formation. This finding is interesting in the view of utilization of these catalysts in a pilot plant reactor under direct solar light irradiation. By coupling Cu2O with TiO2 a p-n heterojunction is generally formed. Under UV light irradiation both oxides are excited and, by considering the bands edge position (Figure 8) [23,24,38], electrons are transferred from the conduction band of Cu2O to that of TiO2 and holes from the valence band of TiO2 to that of Cu2O, enhancing the charges separation and increasing their lifetime. For this system also the formation of a direct Z-scheme has been reported [38,40,41] (Figure 7 green path). After irradiation, the TiO2 conduction band's electrons recombines with the Cu2O valence band's holes and electrons with high reduction ability and holes with high oxidation power are available. The negative potential value of the Cu2O conduction band edge could explain the high activity of Cu2O P25 samples with respect both to Pt-P25 and CuO P25.
