        <p>Solar air collectors (SACs) convert the available solar energy into useful thermal energy commonly for drying and space heating. SACs can be classified based on the characteristics of the collector cover plate, absorber plate materials use surface configuration, integrated or hybrid, number of flow-passes, flow pattern and application. The purpose of the design variation is to increase the heat transfer inside the SAC.Solar air collectors (SACs) convert the available solar energy into useful thermal energy commonly for drying and space heating.

        <p>Hegazy [1] investigated SACs to evaluate it performance using variable width and fixed length collectors. Results indicated that a trapezoidal absorber plate is far better than a concave absorber. Hernández and Quiñonez [2] presented double pass parallel and counter flow SACs through an analytical study. It was observed that the performance of SACs for counter and parallel flow remained the same at higher flow rates. The performance of a perforated glazed solar collector with mass flow rates between 0.017 and 0.036 kg/s was evaluated by Vaziri et al.

Soriga and Badescu [5] highlighted that the thermal inertia of a solar air heater ranged between 0.4 to 0.7. Sun et al.

Benli [17] concluded that a corrugated absorber provided an efficiency of 55% at a flow rate of 0.05 kg/s from five different shapes of absorber surface (flat, corrugate, reverse corrugate, trapeze and reverse trapeze). [18] performed an experimental investigation on double pass SAC with flat and V-corrugated absorber to obtain Nu and friction factor. Results showed a 4.5 times increment in Nu number for the V-corrugated absorbers compared to the flat plate, whilst the friction factor increased by 3.1. An experimental investigation conducted by Kabeel et al.

        <p>Boukadoum and Benzaoui [24] carried out a CFD study to determine the enhancement of the heat transfer rate using rectangular transverse type ribs inside the collector. Results indicated that the rate of heat transfer is increased without huge losses in friction. A correlation between the Nusselt numbers and friction factor for a triangular SAC having rectangular chamfered ribs were proposed by Kumar et al. [25] based on the CFD study by Sharma and Kalamkar [26] conducted an experimental study on SAC having four different thin rib configurations under forced convection to estimate the thermo-hydraulic performance, friction factor, and heat transfer. A computational analysis of a flat-plate SAC operating with a recycled working fluid (0-7 times) showed that the efficiency was increased by 118% due to recycling of the working fluid by 7 times [27][28]. Naphon [29] performed an analytical study to determine the effect of fin height, number of fins, and air flow rate on the performance of a SAC. Mohamad [30] observed that by minimizing the collector losses especially losses through the glass cover, the collector thermal efficiency was around 75%. Ozgen et al. [31] found that the collector efficiency increased by up to 45% at peak solar conditions by attaching aluminium cans with a flat absorber. Omojaro and Aldabbagh [32] studied the performance of single and double pass SACs with finned and wire mesh absorbers. Double pass collector provided up to 19% higher efficiency than that of plain absorber.

        <p>The cross-sectional area of the collector was 1.44 m 2 with a space for absorber plate of 0.97 m ×0.97 m. Other than the absorber plate, the technical specifications of both the SACs were the same. The sides and back of the collector were insulated with thermocol of 0.02 m thick, and the whole system was made up of plywood with the thickness of 0.015 m. Both absorber plates were coated with black paint to increase the absorptivity. For the sand coated absorber, first the black paint and preheated sand of 35-371 micron were mixed by agitating until the sand got a homogeneous mixture and then coated sand were painted over the aluminium absorber and let to dry up. The size and spatial distribution of the used sand is shown in Fig. 2. To reduce the top losses and to drive the air over the absorber, a glazing cover made of acrylic perspex sheet of 0.005 m thick was used. At the inlet section of SAC two DC fans powered from a DC source were used to force air over the absorber. The speed of the fan was controlled by varying the input power supply.The cross-sectional area of the collector was 1.44 m 2 with a space for absorber plate of 0.97 m ×0.97 m.

        <p>In the present study the radiation level was varied form 400 W/m 2 to 800 W/m 2 . A pyranometer was used to measure the radiation level at nine different points on the collector surface to check the uniformity of radiation on the surface before each set of tests. Radiation level was observed to vary by 10%. The average intensity on the collector surface varied between ±15 W/m 2 . The inclination of the SAC and the solar simulator lamp array were kept fixed at 45º. A digital anemometer was used to measure the exit air velocity. Temperature readings from the T-type thermocouples were recorded by a data logger (data taker, DT85) at 30 sec intervals.

        <p>. The ambient temperature (T amb ) was maintained nearly constant during the test period by using air conditioning units. Fig. 3a also presents the temperature of back side insulation (T ins ) and glazing (T glaz ), inlet air temperature to the absorber (T a,in ) and outlet air temperature (T a,out ). After a rapid initial increase, the temperature tends toward a quasi-steady state. Variation in the average absorber temperature at three different locations (inlet (T abs,in ), middle (T abs,mid ), and outlet (T abs,out )) are shown in Fig. 3(b). It can be seen that the temperature of the absorber near the inlet is low due to higher rate of heat transfer. Further, the magnitudes of the absorber temperature keep on increasing along the downstream, indicating lower rate of heat transfer since air temperature increases due to higher absorbance of heat near the inlet. For m=0.01 kg/s/m 2 and at I=400 W/m 2 the typical values of T ins , T glaz , T abs , and T out , are 26.6ºC, 47.5ºC, 63.2ºC, and 46.4ºC, respectively..

        <p>To have a better idea on the absorptivity/reflectivity of the absorber plate, a test was conducted under natural convection mode, by keeping both the absorber plate (plain, sand coated) under solar simulator (Fig. 3c). In general reflectivity of the sand is high. However, it is assumed that the reflectivity of the sand coated absorber is reduced due to the black paint and the nonuniform surface of the absorber. For a period of 2 hours tests, the variation of temperature indicate that, solar absorber plate with sand coating has always at higher temperature, which varies from 1-3 ºC. This indicates that lower reflectivity and higher absorptivity of sand coated absorber. This is in order with the results of Lati et al.

        <p>Variations in the temperature difference for collector with and without sand coated absorber with respect to air mass flow rate for three different radiation levels are shown in Figs. 4a to 4c. In the figures ∆" #(C represents the temperature difference between air inlet and outlet, ∆" DE#F represents the temperature difference between the glazing surface and the ambient, and ∆" #,2 represents the temperature difference between the absorber surface and ambient. Results indicated that with the increase in air mass flow rate all the values of ∆" decreases. The reduction in the value of ∆" #(C is due to the lower retention time of the travelling fluid. Further, the heat removal capacity of the working fluid increases with increasing the air mass flow rate thus reduce the values of ∆" #,2 and ∆" DE#F . The slope of the curves indicate that the rate of decrease of ∆" #,2 is slightly higher than the others; this further reduces the gap between ∆" #,2 and ∆" #(C , especially at higher values of m, indicating better thermal performance of the solar air collector. A comparison of the trend of ∆" indicates that ∆" #(C is always higher for the sand coated absorber for all radiation levels, with heat transfer rates as high as 17% greater. Conformity of higher heat transfer for sand coated absorber may also be seen in the trend for ∆" #,2 . Values of ∆" #,2 for the sand coated absorber are always lower than that of the plain absorber. The maximum reduction is ∆" #,2 for the sand coated absorber is as high as 11% compared to the plain absorber.Variations in the temperature difference for collector with and without sand coated absorber with respect to air mass flow rate for three different radiation levels are shown in Figs. 4a to 4c.

Results indicated that with the increase in air mass flow rate all the values of ∆" decreases. The reduction in the value of ∆" #(C is due to the lower retention time of the travelling fluid. Further, the heat removal capacity of the working fluid increases with increasing the air mass flow rate thus reduce the values of ∆" #,2 and ∆" DE#F . The slope of the curves indicate that the rate of decrease of ∆" #,2 is slightly higher than the others; this further reduces the gap between ∆" #,2 and ∆" #(C , especially at higher values of m, indicating better thermal performance of the solar air collector. A comparison of the trend of ∆" indicates that ∆" #(C is always higher for the sand coated absorber for all radiation levels, with heat transfer rates as high as 17% greater. Conformity of higher heat transfer for sand coated absorber may also be seen in the trend for ∆" #,2 . Values of ∆" #,2 for the sand coated absorber are always lower than that of the plain absorber. The maximum reduction is ∆" #,2 for the sand coated absorber is as high as 11% compared to the plain absorber.</p>

        <p>It can be seen that the magnitude of ∆G increases continuously with the increase in air flow rate (m). This might be due to higher frictional resistance, which in turn increases the requirement of fan power.

        <p>Temporal variations of overall loss coefficient (0 E ) are depicted in Fig. 7(a-d) for the collectors with and without the sand coating. The overall heat loss consists of losses through the back and side insulation, and through the glazing. Top loss (including convection and radiation) through the glazing is much higher than the back losses. This might be the reason for a steady state value of overall loss coefficient after a typical value of time period even though the back losses tend to increase continuously with time (refer the temperature variation of glazing and insulation in Fig. 3).Temporal variations of overall loss coefficient (0 E ) are depicted in Fig. 7(a-d) for the collectors with and without the sand coating.

The thermal efficiency of the SAC increases with the increase in mass flow rate under all conditions. Higher heat extraction rate by the working fluid (due to higher thermal capacity of air) is the reason for the same. Thermal efficiency increases at higher mass flow rates for between 0.01 and 0.015 kg/s/m 2 , after that the rate of increase decreases. This may be due to the increases in leakage losses in the SAC and the lower retention time of the fluid. Overall by increasing the flow rate by 90%, at a radiation level of 400 W/m 2 , the thermal efficiency for the SAC with plain and sand coated absorber is found to be enhanced by about 25% and 17%, respectively.
