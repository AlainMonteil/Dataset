        <p>cess toward a circular economy. [1] Water electrolysis consists of two electrochemical half-reactions: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to produce hydrogen at the cathode and the OER to evolve oxygen at the anode, respectively. While the HER is a relatively straightforward two-electron transfer process, the main bottleneck is the sluggish four-electron OER that limits the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. [2,3] Currently, the common and matured industrialized electrolyzers to produce hydrogen rely on either acidic (proton-exchange membrane) or alkaline conditions. Out of which, alkaline electrolyzers are of particular importance as they use low-cost and earth-abundant materials to make the system fully sustainable and economically competitive. [4] As stated above, in order to increase the efficiency of the electrolyzers, improved anodes with high intrinsic activity are required. Notably, for alkaline electrolyzers, Ni-based materials have been the typical choice as anode (OER) materials because of their cost-effectiveness, high elemental abundance, good resistance to corrosive solutions, and low toxicity. [5,6] In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design, synthesis, and development of a variety of highly efficient Ni-based electrocatalysts involving oxides/hydroxides, chalcogenides, pnictides, alloys, and even metal-organic frameworks for OER at the lab scale to minimize the energetic losses in alkaline electrolysis. [6][7][8][9][10][11] Besides, significant efforts have been made to modify Ni-based electrocatalysts through heterostructure formation, oxygendefect generation, doping with heteroatoms, as well as phase and morphology engineering to attain technically viable efficiencies. However, further improvement beyond the current state of the art is required to enhance the overall OER performance. [9][10][11][12][13][14] Most of the Ni-based catalysts transform under the electrochemical alkaline conditions into electronically similar layered oxyhydroxide (LOH) phase with Ni III O x H y structure. [15,16] Similar to other transition-metal electrocatalysts, the OER activity of Ni-based catalysts largely depends on the defects, surface area, morphology, crystal structure of the precatalyst (e.g., NiNi distances), amount of edge/corner-sharing [NiO 6 ] units, size of the crystallite domain, etc. of the transformed Ni III O x H y phases,cess toward a circular economy.

        <p>The development of novel earth-abundant metal-based catalysts to accelerate the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the process of large-scale production of green hydrogen. To solve this bottleneck, herein, a simple one-pot colloidal approach is reported to yield crystalline intermetallic nickel silicide (Ni 2 Si), which results in a promising precatalyst for anodic OER. Subsequently, an anodic-coupled electrosynthesis for the selective oxidation of organic amines (as sacrificial proton donating agents) to value-added organocyanides is established to boost the cathodic reaction. A partial transformation of the Ni 2 Si intermetallic precatalyst generates a porous nickel(oxy)hydroxide phase modified with oxidic silicon species as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of quasi in situ Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods. The activated form of the catalyst generates a geometric current density of 100 mA cm -2 at an overpotential (η 100 ) of 348 mV displaying long-term durability over a week and high efficiency in paired electrolysis.The development of novel earth-abundant metal-based catalysts to accelerate the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the process of large-scale production of green hydrogen.

        <p>In this regard, intermetallic compounds are an interesting class of compounds for electrocatalytic OER as they possess ordered structures with intermediate bonding nature (between ionic and covalent), which are different than those of the constituent elements. [20,21] Our recent investigations on intermetallic compounds have shown that they transform partially or completely during harsh alkaline OER to electronically similar LOH structures. [17,[22][23][24][25] Nevertheless, these LOH species are structurally and morphologically different and are responsible for varied electrolyte diffusion, electrochemical surface area, and surface versus bulk activity. Here, the leaching of ions is unavoidable and plays a major structure-determining role in the evolution of LOH species. Considering the natural abundance of Si, low electrical resistivity (10-24 µΩ cm), nature of chemical bonds between Ni and Si (e.g., weak Ni(d)-Si(p) interaction), and electrochemical Pourbaix diagram of Ni and Si, the NiSi intermetallic system could be a suitable and facile source to generate highly active LOH species (e.g., Ni III O x H y ) during OER. [26][27][28] However, like other intermetallics, the common solid-state synthesis of nickel silicides also involves an energy-intensive high-temperature process that often leads to high polydispersity, large aggregations, low surface area, phase impurities, passivating oxide layers on the metal silicide nanoparticle (NP), and undesired by-products which may affect the overall catalytic performances. [29,30] This motivated us to apply a unique colloidal approach to achieve the low-temperature formation of nickel silicide nanostructures with controlled solvation and nucleation, low polydispersity, and high phase purity.In this regard, intermetallic compounds are an interesting class of compounds for electrocatalytic OER as they possess ordered structures with intermediate bonding nature (between ionic and covalent), which are different than those of the constituent elements.

        <p>Alternatively, pairing water splitting with organic transformation to value-added products (electrosynthesis) has been one of the thriving research topics in the last couple of years. In this context, choosing electrooxidative dehydrogenation of primary amines to cyanides is of special interest, mostly because i) sacrificial proton donating amines could boost up the HER at the cathode, [31] and ii) cyanides are valuable synthones for carboxylic acids, esters, aldehydes, imines, heterocycles, oximes, etc. [32] To date, the synthesis of cyanides mostly involves the nucleophilic substitution of halide with highly toxic cyanide ions, [33] or ammoxidation process, which is inherently limited by the poor functional group tolerance due to harsh reaction conditions (300-350 °C). [34] Direct electrooxidation of amines in aqueous alkaline media avoids these difficulties and provides an opportunity for industrial-scale cyanides production sustainably. [35] In view of the above, the current work addresses and answers the following questions: i) Can one synthesize homogeneously distributed well-defined intermetallic nickel silicide (NiSi) nanostructure avoiding high-temperature solid-state methods? ii) Is this NiSi active and durable for OER? iii) Can a phase transformation be uncovered by in situ spectroscopy (Raman, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)) and how does Si behave under the OER condition? iv) How can leaching ions (e.g., Si) control over the redox behavior of active structure as compared to that generated from a (pre)catalyst with no leaching ion? v) Is the in situ formed active phase also suitable for multielectron oxidations of organic compounds such as dehydrogenation?Alternatively, pairing water splitting with organic transformation to value-added products (electrosynthesis) has been one of the thriving research topics in the last couple of years.

        <p>Herein, we report the synthesis of ordered Ni 2 Si NPs using a one-pot colloidal approach and utilized it as an OER electro(pre)catalyst. Under alkaline conditions, the intermetallic Ni 2 Si transformed into Ni III O x H y phase as an active phase by concomitant corrosion of Si to silicate. To uncover the correlation between Si leaching during electrochemical transformation and its catalytic activity, we carried out quasi in situ XAS together with Raman spectroscopy on Ni 2 Si NPs treated under OER condition and compared it with metallic Ni NPs having similar morphology and electronic properties. The activated form of the catalyst not only generated a low overpotential of 348 mV at 100 mA cm -2 (η 100 ) in OER but was also effective for selective dehydrogenation of primary amines to nitriles with very high efficiency.Herein, we report the synthesis of ordered Ni 2 Si NPs using a one-pot colloidal approach and utilized it as an OER electro(pre)catalyst.

        <p>NiSi system (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern revealed the presence of a pure crystalline Ni 2 Si phase (Figure S2, Supporting Information) that crystallizes in the orthorhombic space-group Pnma (62) and thus belongs to oP12 structures (Figure 1a, Figure S3; Table S1, Supporting Information). The unit cell consists of 12 atoms (4 Si and 8 Ni atoms) with eight different sets of direct NiSi bonds with lengths ranging from 2.0823-3.9809 Å. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Ni 2 Si show distorted spherical NPs with an average diameter of 20 nm. Lattice fringes resolved in high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) measurements as well as the selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) confirm the presence of the pure Ni 2 Si phase (Figure 1b-d).

        <p>The as-prepared Ni 2 Si precatalyst was deposited on nickel foam (NF) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) using electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which is a binder-free deposition technique. This procedure preserved the chemical structure of the Ni 2 Si and the oxidation state of the constituent elements and led to the formation of homogenous films (Figures S16-S23, Supporting Information). The EPD time was correlated with the mass loading and film thickness of the catalyst on FTO substrate, which was optimized based on the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) current (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The mass loading for FTO and NF was 0.4 ± 0.1 and 0.8 ± 0.1 mg, respectively. The measurements were carried out under ironfree 1 m KOH solution to avoid Fe inclusion from the electrolyte. [37] Ni 2 Si did not alter its parent structure in the alkaline medium without applying a potential (Figure S25, Supporting Information). Before evaluating the electrochemical activities, CV cycles were recorded until current responses of the N II /Ni III redox potential (1.2-1.5 V RHE ) remain unchanged (Figure S26, Supporting Information). The difference between the 1 st and consecutive cycles indicates the transformation of Ni 2 Si precatalyst. [38,39] To compare the electrocatalytic activity, the metallic Ni NPs isolated before silicidation and NiOOH NPs, synthesized by reducing the Ni(OH) 2 in aqueous persulfate solution, were measured under identical condition (see Supporting Information, experimental section, and Figures S27-S29, Supporting Information). As displayed in Figure 2a, compared to Ni and NiOOH, the CV curves revealed substantially lower overpotentials (η) for Ni 2 Si/NF, with η 10 and η 100 of 247 ± 3 and 348 ± 6 mV, respectively. Nevertheless, the steady-state Tafel slopes of all three compounds are comparable (Figure 2b), implying a similar nature of active sites for the Ni-based catalysts, which follow the same OER ratedetermining step. [40,41] The long-term stability of the Ni 2 Si/NF catalyst was measured by chronopotentiometry (CP) at 100 mA cm -2 , which exhibited almost steady η value of around 350 mV for 200 h (Figure 2c). In contrast, Ni/NF and NiOOH/NF showed a deactivation during a 24 h CP measurement (Figure S30, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the long-term stability at a higher current density of 400 mA cm -2 was also measured for two days with no deterioration in OER activity its suitability for practical electrolysis (Figure S31, Supporting Information). To correlate the catalytic activity and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), the double layer capacitance (C dl ) values of the Ni 2 Si, Ni, and NiOOH were measured after 24 h of OER CP at 100 mA cm -2 . The C dl of a specific catalyst is qualitatively proportional to the ECSA, [42] and can be obtained from CVs with different scan rates measured in a non-Faradaic region. The extracted C dl value of Ni 2 Si is the highest among the Ni-based reference catalysts (Figures S32 andS33, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the C dl values of Ni 2 Si/NF and Ni/NF were almost the same before the CP measurement; however, the C dl of Ni 2 Si/NF increased significantly through the OER, making it more than two times larger than the one of Ni/ NF after catalysis. This implies a larger surface transformation of Ni 2 Si precatalyst (Figure 2d and Figures S34 andS35, Supporting Information). Moreover, the BET surface area normalized current density values of Ni 2 Si/NF and Ni/NF did not alter the activity trends. However, the normalization with C dl values resulted in closer activity of Ni 2 Si and Ni NP (Figure S36, Supporting Information). This indicates that the activity enhancement is majorly caused by more electrochemically active sites formed during surface transformation. The activity trends were further confirmed by the semicircle diameter of the Nyquist plots, recorded with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at 1.55 V. (Figure 2e and Figure S37, Supporting Information; The Nyquist plots were fitted with the simple equivalent Randles circuit model, yields both R s and R ct . Fitting parameters are tabulated in Tables S3 andS4, Supporting Information). To compare the activity with other reference anode catalysts, we synthesized a series of precious and nonnoble-based catalysts and deposited them on NF using a similar method with approximately the same mass loading (0.8 ± 0.1 mg) (Figure 2f, Figures S38-S40, Supporting Information). Impressively, the Ni 2 Si/NF electrode has the smallest η 100 even in comparison to the well-known active layered NiFeO x H y catalyst under identical OER conditions (Figure 2f). Furthermore, an OER Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98 ± 3% was obtained for Ni 2 Si/NF, which was determined by measuring the evolved O 2 gas (Figure S41, Supporting Information).The as-prepared Ni 2 Si precatalyst was deposited on nickel foam (NF) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) using electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which is a binder-free deposition technique.

We realized that with this method, the as-prepared Ni 2 Si crystallite undergoes agglomeration to form larger particles, and subsequently, the current value was much lower (Figure S48, Supporting Information).</p>
        <p>To monitor the structural transformation and gather insights into the active form of the catalyst, we conducted OER-CP at 10 mA cm -2 for 24 h with Ni 2 Si/FTO and subsequently characterized them. The SEM images after OER display a deep surface transformation of the precatalyst and the EDX spectrum shows a less intense peak for Si and a peak for O, suggesting the formation of an oxo-based structure (Figures S49-S51, Supporting Information). The resulting Ni:Si ratio is calculated to be 1:0.22 (ICP yield 1:0.26), confirming almost ≈50% loss of Si from the Ni 2 Si precatalyst structure. Most notably, our results on the Ni 2 Si electrodes under prolonged stability and at high current density under harsh OER operation conditions also confirmed that only a maximum of 50% of Si leaching is feasible from the structure (Figure S52, Supporting Information). After OER, the PXRD pattern showed weaker reflections of the Ni 2 Si phase and no additional new peaks showing that some crystalline Ni 2 Si remains and most likely a new oxidic amorphous phase has formed. (Figure S53, Supporting Information). [16,43] To obtain more information on the surface transformation, morphology, and structure, we scratched off Ni 2 Si particles from FTO and recorded TEM. The TEM and HR-TEM images clearly exhibited typical core-shell features with a dense crystalline phase (≈ 10 nm) buried under an amorphous layer (Figure 3 and Figure S54, Supporting Information). The corresponding scanning TEM (STEM) elemental mapping (Figure 3) revealed that the amorphous component is majorly composed of Ni-oxo species. The SAED profile extracted from the selected area TEM image displayed several diffuse rings (Figure S54, Supporting Information) and the estimated radius for the diffused rings confirms the presence of γ-NiOOH phase. The TEM EDX quantification confirmed the loss of Si (Figure S55, Supporting Information). In order to uncover the valence of Ni and Si in the post-reaction sample, a core-level XPS was recorded and compared with that of Ni treated under the same OER conditions (Figure 4a, Figure S56, Supporting Information). In the post-OER Ni 2 Si, the deconvoluted Ni 2p 3/2 profile correlates with Ni III species. [44,45] The binding energy values obtained here for Ni III are identical to γ-NiOOH phases reported in the literature. [46,47] On the other hand, metal-like Si states originating from NiSi bonds were not visible after OER, instead, higher valent Si species (Si II , Si IV ) were present (Figure S56, Supporting Information). Additionally, the O 1s spectra before and after OER confirms the presence of silicon-oxo (hydroxide or suboxide), nickel oxide, and nickel (oxy)hydroxide species. FT-IR spectroscopy after OER uncovered intense hydration of the catalyst film (Figure S57, Supporting Information). Pristine Ni 2 Si has an IR band in the fingerprint region (around 580 cm -1 ) which can be assigned to stretching vibrations of NiSi. [48] After OER, this band disappeared and a broad band was visible at around 650 cm -1 , which can be ascribed to Ni III -O stretching vibrations of γ-NiOOH. [44,46,49] Additionally, the band centered at 1382 cm -1 can be attributed to carbonoxygen stretching vibrations of CO 3 2-, which originates from dissolved CO 2 in KOH solution. [50] It has been previously shown that such CO 3 2-is intercalated into the γ-NiOOH layers which can be beneficial for the OER.

        <p>To correlate the structural transformation of Ni 2 Si with the catalytic activity, we carried out in situ Raman and X-ray absorption on the freeze-quenched (-196 °C) samples. As prepared Ni 2 Si exhibits no Raman active transitions above noise level within the measured spectral width (200-1000 cm -1 ) (Figure 4b). The in situ Ni 2 Si sample (treated under CP at 10 mA cm -2 for 24 h and freeze quenched at 1.58 V RHE ) contains two major bands at 481 and 561 cm -1 typical for the γ-NiOOH. [16,51] The peak centered at 481 cm -1 is associated with the depolarized E g mode (bending vibration of the oxygen atoms along the plane), whereas the band at 561 cm -1 can be ascribed to the polarized A 1g mode (stretching vibration of oxygen atom perpendicular to the plane). [51] The peak intensity ratio resembles earlier reported γ-NiOOH phases containing lattice disorder and distorted interlayer spacing between the sheets. [52] In situ Ni displayed a similar feature that confirms the formation of an identical active structure during surface transformation. Furthermore, the peak at 600 cm -1 and broad features at around 780 and 900 cm -1 (magnified inset image) of the in situ Raman of Ni 2 Si can be correlated with the ν(Si IV O -), ν(SiOSi), and ν(SiOH) vibrations. [53,54] These remaining silicon oxide species could potentially stabilize OER reaction intermediates and improve the kinetics, as it has been shown for surface adsorbed chalcogenide oxoanions previously. [55] To determine the in situ oxidation states and to uncover structural features of the amorphous phase, in situ XAS analysis was performed. All in situ XAS were measured after OER-CP at 10 mA cm -2 for 24 h and freeze quenched at 1.58 V RHE or 1.10 V RHE (chronoamperometry). For both Ni and Ni 2 Si, a clear shift of the Ni edge is observed, indicating the oxidation of the metallic precatalysts during OER is consistent with the other analytical investigations (Figure 4c). The halfedge of Ni 2 Si appears at higher energy, revealing that a more oxidized γ-NiOOH phase is formed from the Ni 2 Si precatalysts compared to Ni. [39] Further, the comparison of in situ XANES measurements at a potential below the Ni II/III redox feature (1.10 V RHE ) and those above this redox feature (1.58 V RHE , see inset Figure 4c) shows a significantly larger difference for Ni 2 Si than Ni indicating a higher Ni II/III redox activity for Ni 2 Si.To correlate the structural transformation of Ni 2 Si with the catalytic activity, we carried out in situ Raman and X-ray absorption on the freeze-quenched (-196 °C) samples.

        <p>From the ex situ and in situ analysis, we could show that under anodic potential, Ni 2 Si acts as a precatalyst and undergoes partial corrosion deep inside the surface, which is in accordance with the Pourbaix diagram of Ni and Si. The dissolution of Si from the structure of Ni 2 Si accompanied by the concomitant oxygen substitution resulted in the formation of an amorphous γ-NiOOH overlayer on the crystalline Ni 2 Si core. The transformation of Ni 2 Si into the γ-NiOOH phase occurs through the formation of Ni II species. [56] We confirm this reconstruction of Ni 2 Si using Raman spectra of different Ni 2 Si/FTO films freeze-quenched at 30 s, 1 min, and 5 min under a constant potential of 1.5 V RHE (Figure S61, Supporting Information). The result displays the formation of nickel oxo species (mixture of α-Ni(OH) 2 and γ-NiOOH) within 1 min which thereafter transformed into the γ-NiOOH phase over prolong reaction time. Nevertheless, the active structure observed for both Ni 2 Si and Ni NPs precatalysts was very similar, and in both cases, the formation of γ-NiOOH active catalyst is unavoidable. Based on the Bruke and O'Sullivan studies, the skeletal nature of this amorphous γ-NiOOH should be a major advantage from an electrocatalytic viewpoint as it permits a major increase in the number of oxycations participating in the electrode reaction. [57] The conceptual picture is that γ-NiOOH fragments with molecular dimensions are surrounded by electrolytes composed of water, anions, and cations. Continuous OER activity is maintained by conduction of the proton from the bulk catalyst phase to the bulk-electrolyte. The calculated turnover frequency values were 4.1 × 10 -2 and 9.4 × 10 -3 for Ni 2 Si and Ni NP, respectively, at the η value of 300 mV (with FTO). Moreover, the similar Tafel slopes of both catalysts indicate the same kind of active sites. Hence, the activity difference is majorly caused by an unequal number of active sites. The higher activity of Ni 2 Si than that of Ni NPs can be explained by the leaching of Si into the electrolyte that creates a large number of voids in the in situ formed NiOOH phase and enables more electrolyte permeability. Thus, not only the surface but also bulk Ni sites have access to the electrolyte and can participate in the catalytic process resulting in bulk catalytic activity. [58,59] Additionally, we tried to find a metric that reflects the difference in the number of catalytically active sites. In this regard, we normalized the current density using the charge passed during the reverse scan of the Ni II/III redox peak for both Ni 2 Si and metallic Ni. This normalization resulted in identical current density for Ni 2 Si and metallic Ni (Figure S62, Supporting Information). Thus, in this case, the number of reversibly reducible Ni sites correlates well with the number of catalytically active sites, and both catalysts most likely have the same kind of active sites.From the ex situ and in situ analysis, we could show that under anodic potential, Ni 2 Si acts as a precatalyst and undergoes partial corrosion deep inside the surface, which is in accordance with the Pourbaix diagram of Ni and Si.

        <p>Recently, replacing OER with organic transformation in an electrochemical cell has proven to be an effective approach for the simultaneous production of clean H 2 fuel at the cathode and value-added organic products at the anode, thus constructing a more efficient and economical water-splitting system. [60] The conventional OER kinetics is sluggish and requires high overpotentials to produce the low-value product oxygen. This facile hybrid water electrolysis approach can overcome the above problem, which basically requires lower oxidation potential than OER, and produces high-value oxidation and reduction products at both the anode and the cathode, respectively. [23,61] Herein, we coupled the OER with dehydrogenation of the organic amines, which offers an ideal platform to produce value-added nitriles together with augmenting green hydrogen production at the cathode. These nitrile functional groups can be found in various natural products, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides. [62] The typical synthesis of organocyanide compounds involves expensive noble metals and an organic compound with a leaving group by the substitution of stoichiometric toxic reagents such as KCN or CuCN. [63] Here we report the synthesis of cyanide compounds using non-precious materials under mild conditions. The electrooxidation of organic amines was carried out in 1 m KOH solution, and benzylamine (BA) was selected as the model substrate. Moreover, the onset potential displayed a shift of 48 mV after BA addition. This suggests that the electrocatalytic oxidation of BA is a more thermodynamically favorable reaction than OER and can be integrated with high-efficiency H 2 generation. We observed a rigorous H 2 gas bubble generation at the cathode starting from 1.37 V, attributing the reduction of additional H + originating from subsequent BA oxidation. On the other hand, for bare NF, the BA oxidation LSV showed a trivial increase of the current density value as compared to without BA. To explore the potential dependence of BA oxidation on Ni 2 Si and to get a quantitative idea of the corresponding product, bulk electrolysis was carried out by applying a constant potential at 1.49 V RHE in an undivided cell that started with a current density of 275 mA cm -2 in the presence of 50 mm BA in 10 mL 1 m KOH (Figure S63, Supporting Information). After 40 min of electrolysis at room temperature, it was observed that a 193 C charge was passed. The characterization of the reaction mixture of oxidation products by 1 H NMR spectroscopy reveals the complete conversion of BA to benzonitrile with an FE value of 99% (Figure 5c, Figure S64, Supporting Information). Notably, the amount of H 2 gas evolution was ten-fold higher as compared to pristine OER condition (Figure S63, Supporting Information) and estimated as 67 wt.% H 2 based on amine content. Similarly, the control reaction was performed on bare NF under the same specified condition, which exhibited a 107.6 C charge passed after 40 min of electrolysis (Figure S63, Supporting Information). The corresponding 1 H NMR spectra of the reaction mixture confirmed a less than 50% conversion of BA (Figure 5c). The bulk electrolysis was further investigated at different potentials (at 1.41 V RHE and 1.46 V RHE which belong to the broad redox feature of the BA) and performed at the same time which indicates that the conversion rate increased with the increasing potential (Figure S63, Supporting Information). Additionally, the activity was compared with as-prepared NiS and Ni(OH) 2 . The CV of the Ni(OH) 2 /NF and NiS/NF in presence of 50 mm BA showed a typical redox peak for BA oxidation. The bulk electrolysis was carried out at 1.49 V RHE and the product was determined using 1 H NMR spectroscopy after 40 min of the reaction, which showed 45% and 60% of the conversion of BA in benzonitrile for Ni(OH) 2 and NiS, respectively (Figure S65, Supporting Information). We then investigated the broader applicability of Ni 2 Si anode for the oxidation of various aliphatic amines (Figure 5d). Butylamine and hexylamine were successfully oxidized to corresponding nitriles at a remarkably lower potential than that of OER on Ni 2 Si (Figure S66, Supporting Information). With the help of 1 H NMR, the estimated FE for the conversion of butylamine and hexylamine was 79% and 65%, respectively (Figures S67 and S68, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the electrocatalytic oxidation of di-substituted aliphatic amines such as hexamethylenediamine and 2,2-dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine selectively yielded the corresponding aliphatic dicyanide products such as adiponitrile and 2,2-dimethylmalononitrile, respectively (Figures S69 and S70, Supporting Information). It should be noted that adiponitrile is a precursor to the nylon-6,6 polymer. The above results suggest that Ni 2 Si is a low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst to oxidize aromatic or aliphatic amines to corresponding cyanide products with significantly lower overpotential compared to the OER, which may be integrated with high-efficiency H 2 generation for water electrolysis.Recently, replacing OER with organic transformation in an electrochemical cell has proven to be an effective approach for the simultaneous production of clean H 2 fuel at the cathode and value-added organic products at the anode, thus constructing a more efficient and economical water-splitting system.

        <p>In conclusion, we have adopted a rational colloidal approach that has driven control diffusion of the Si atoms into Ni crystallites yielding well-defined Ni 2 Si NPs. The as-prepared Ni 2 Si has been employed as a promising OER electro(pre)catalyst displaying excellent activities and stabilities both on NF and FTO in 1 m Fe-free KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the phase transformation of Ni 2 Si has been successfully monitored by the quasi in situ XAS and resonance Raman technique, which revealed a larger electrochemical transformation for Ni 2 Si as compared to Ni NPs. The normalization of the LSV current density by BET surface area and C dl produced by Ni 2 Si and Ni clearly indicates that the catalytic activity was dominated by the amount of surface transformation. A similar Tafel slope, Raman bands, and EXAFS fit (with corresponding crystallographic parameters) confirms that Ni 2 Si and Ni NPs feature an identical Ni III O x H y active phase, although the dissolution of Si (through e.g. oxide, hydroxide, polysilicates) is expected to generate a more porous Ni III O x H y phase with a distorted layered structure and facilitate electrolyte penetration. Additionally, Ni 2 Si in the activated form is highly efficient for electrooxidative dehydrogenation of primary amines into nitriles with the highest selectivity and broad substrate scope. The presented study would be helpful to develop a new class of solid-state intermetallic materials that were difficult to prepare in its nano-form and to understand the relationship between electrochemical transformation and catalytic activities of a wide variety of solid-state intermetallic materials for water splitting and electrochemical organic oxidation.In conclusion, we have adopted a rational colloidal approach that has driven control diffusion of the Si atoms into Ni crystallites yielding well-defined Ni 2 Si NPs.
