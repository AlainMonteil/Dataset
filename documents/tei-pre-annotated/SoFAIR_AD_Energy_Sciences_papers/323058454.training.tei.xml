        <p>Machine learning (ML) has been recognised as a powerful method for modelling building energy consumption. The capability of ML to provide a fast and accurate prediction of energy loads makes it an ideal tool for decisionmaking tasks related to sustainable design and retrofit planning. However, the accuracy of these ML models is dependent on the selection of the right hyper-parameters for a specific building dataset. This paper proposes a method for optimising ML models for forecasting both heating and cooling loads. The technique employs multi-objective optimisation with evolutionary algorithms to search the space of possible parameters. The proposed approach not only tunes single model to precisely predict building energy loads but also accelerates the process of model optimisation. The study utilises simulated building energy data generated in 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs> to validate the proposed method, and compares the outcomes with the regular ML tuning procedure (i.e. grid search). The optimised model provides a reliable tool for building designers and engineers to explore a large space of the available building materials and technologies.

        <p>There have been several approaches proposed to enhance the energy efficiency of buildings in many countries in recent decades. For instance in Europe, it was estimated in 2010 that 60 billion Euros could be saved annually by improving EU buildings' energy performance by 20 per cent [1].There have been several approaches proposed to enhance the energy efficiency of buildings in many countries in recent decades. For instance in Europe, it was estimated in 2010 that 60 billion Euros could be saved annually by improving EU buildings' energy performance by 20 per cent [1].</p>
        <p>Every attempt to optimise the energy performance of buildings involves a series of calculations to estimate the energy consumption and create an index, such as an 'energy performance indicator' or 'use intensity' from the measured data [2,3]. Most prevailing optimisation methods are simulationbased where the energy-related objectives (i.e. energy consumption or gas emissions) are calculated by a Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tool such as 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> and ESP-r. This approach restricts the computing complexity of the algorithms to BPSs' calculation time. As such, when a vast range of solutions are defined, the calculation and optimisation process may become extremely costly and cumbersome. For this reason, most of the studies which focused on decision making for energy performance improvement of buildings either investigated basic and simple optimisation models or targeted retrofitting only one or two parts of envelopes to pare-down total calculation time and cost. It should also be noted that the majority of studies targeted residential buildings, and there are only a few examples of research related to tertiary buildings. A key component of achieving global development and meeting climate change mitigation targets is the optimisation of the entire building stock. This process requires significant testing and planning to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>With the tremendous growth in the amount of valid and attainable datasets of buildings and collection of Big Data from smart buildings, there is an increasing interest in the employment of Artificial Intelligent (AI) methods specifically Machine Learning (ML) techniques for analysing, modelling, and predicting building data [4,5].With the tremendous growth in the amount of valid and attainable datasets of buildings and collection of Big Data from smart buildings, there is an increasing interest in the employment of Artificial Intelligent (AI) methods specifically Machine Learning (ML) techniques for analysing, modelling, and predicting building data [4,5].</p>

        <p>As ML methods build s model over a historical dataset, the main and most important step for having accurate predictions is the extraction of relevant features. Depending on the nature of predictions (the energy indicator and forecasting period), this variable could include simple basic weather indices (e.g. temperature and humidity) or complex building characteristics and climate parameters. Previous research has demonstrated that rather than feature extraction the process of tuning a model itself not only increases the predictive accuracy but also reduces model complexity, ease of use, and consistency of predictions [6]. It has been argued that considering occupancy in retrofit decision-making, particularly in populated real estate properties such as higher education buildings, could leverage energy efficiency [7].As ML methods build s model over a historical dataset, the main and most important step for having accurate predictions is the extraction of relevant features.

        <p>ML techniques have been widely used for modelling building energy loads and performance. Traditionally, the default values for hyper-parameters have been used in this field. However, in recent years researchers have started to tune the ML models to have more accurate predictions of energy metrics [8,9,10,11]. Tuning ML model hyper-parameters using a grid search can be time-consuming when a complex method is chosen such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or models based on decision trees.ML techniques have been widely used for modelling building energy loads and performance.

        <p>Machine learning algorithms are categorised into two groups: supervised learning, in which the data is labelled, and unsupervised learning, where there is no target for the records in the dataset. Supervised learning is a regression analysis or a set of classifications linking inputs factors (X) to single or multiple "output" variables (Y ). Whereas, in unsupervised learning, data is organised into clusters by pulling out similarities between various samples within the dataset. As such, unsupervised learning is applied to unlabelled datasets. In contrast, in the supervised learning algorithms, the input-output relationships are detected and used for the prediction of new records. Kalogirou et al. [14] were the first team of researchers who employed ML models to determine the heating loads of a building, taking into consideration the building envelope features as well as the temperature outside. In a related study, ANNs were used in estimating the electricity demand level in a holiday residence, simulated in 
            <rs type="software">ZID</rs> software [15]. A more recent study [16] also applied ANNs to forecast the heating loads of a simulated house in Nicosia, Cyprus with the aim of finding a Pareto scenario when dealing with various types of walls and roofs, with different constructional arrangements and material types. They utilised 
            <rs type="software">TRaNsient SYstem (</rs>TRNSYS) as the energy evaluation engine for all building combinations. The model was then validated by comparing the calculated energy consumption with the actual measurement from the building. More recent studies have widely used ANN for estimating building heating and cooling loads [17,18,19,20], electricity demand [21,22,23], and energy consumption [24,25,26].

        <p>Yalcintas [27,28] created an ANN model for estimating energy benchmarking considering tropical climate weather data and including chiller data. These buildings included offices, classrooms, laboratory-type buildings, and miscellaneous use buildings. The efficiency of 'energy use intensity calculation' is examined against multiple linear regression techniques indicating an exceptional improvement over it. Hong [29] also used ANN for energy performance evaluation of primary and secondary schools established in the UK by computing electrical and heating usage. Although it was found that the accuracy of ANN outperforms traditional statistical models, these predictions were not as accurate as simulation and engineering calculations [30]. Wong et al. [31] applied ANN on a commercial building, including day-lighting located in Hong Kong to assess the dynamic energy performance. EnergyPlus and methods for computation of interior reflection are utilised to produce the building daily energy load. Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient is used as the primary measurement to investigate ANN accuracy in predicting cooling, heating, electric lighting and total electricity consumption. Ascione et al. [32] trained ANN models to predict the energy performance of existing and renovated buildings, along with the occupant thermal comfort. Support Vector Machine (SVM) for prediction of building energy indicators was introduced by Dong et al. [33] and adopted by a number of studies for estimation of cooling and heating loads [34,35,36,37], electricity consumption [11,38], and energy consumption [39,40,41,9,42,43].Yalcintas [27,28] created an ANN model for estimating energy benchmarking considering tropical climate weather data and including chiller data.

        <p>The use of ensemble ML models (e.g. RF and gradient boosted regression trees) in the building energy domain is restricted to recent years [44,45,46,47,6], despite an established track-record of utilisation in other disciplines. Li et al. [48] compared SVM, ANN and ensemble models on prediction of building energy performance by using trust metric to evaluate the reliability of the models. The superiority of SVM and ML over the ensemble and linear models was concluded. However, the authors did not optimise the models to generate the Pareto frontier. In a recent study [6] which tuned and compared the most commonly used models revealed the better performance of ensemble models over others. Papadopoulos et al. [12] also compared different ensemble models in estimation of the energy performance of residential buildings (including 768 variations of a model building) evaluated using

        <p>Simple models with few parameters like SVM are easy to optimise, but when the number of hyper-parameters is increased the search space grows exponentially. For example, to tune an RF with six parameters, a grid search will explore more than four thousands possible configurations. That is why traditionally, the researchers mostly relied on default values for those hyperparameters. However, such models provide far more accurate results by precisely tuning in comparison with SVM or Gaussian process regression [6].Simple models with few parameters like SVM are easy to optimise, but when the number of hyper-parameters is increased the search space grows exponentially.

        <p>However, formulating a logical set of variables for these models is both essential and laborious, particularly when modelling complex systems such as the energy efficiency of commercial buildings. The determined features might be building characteristics or weather data or complex parameters computed from primary ones, for example, median dew point temperature [5]. After feature engineering, which also includes imputation/elimination of missing data and normalisation, the next step is to optimise the model itself. In this phase, the hyper-parameters of ML models are tuned in a way to achieve the highest possible accuracy. There are no explicit rules to guide the selection of these parameters by considering the dataset detail such as the number of records or input variables. Hence, the best dataset can be selected using a brute-force search. Another way to find the best feature is to use evolutionary algorithms such as a genetic algorithm. This not only reduces the processing time of the search procedure but also provides better performance.However, formulating a logical set of variables for these models is both essential and laborious, particularly when modelling complex systems such as the energy efficiency of commercial buildings.

        <p>In the proposed method, a MOO technique is utilised to exploit genetic algorithm in the optimisation of ML models for prediction of heating and cooling loads of buildings. Figure 1 demonstrates the proposed optimisation procedure for selecting the best hyper-parameters. Here, the ML parameters are defined as the MOO variables to generate several sets with which ML model accuracy is maximised for forecasting both energy loads. Most implementations of the established ML models such as NN and RF support the concurrent prediction of multiple targets. However, choosing a set of hyper-parameters might improve the prediction accuracy of one target but less the accuracy of the other objective function [6].In the proposed method, a MOO technique is utilised to exploit genetic algorithm in the optimisation of ML models for prediction of heating and cooling loads of buildings.

            <rs type="software">library</rs>) to create a model. This is evaluated using a 10-fold cross validation method. In this approach, the dataset is divided into 10 equal segments. Then a model is trained using 9 parts and tested on the remaining one, and this procedure is repeated until the accuracy of the model is assessed covering all parts. Finally, the average values of the model performance (e.g. mean absolute error) of all 10 folds is sent to the MOO. It continues generating new samples and evaluating models until it reaches 500 iterations.

        <p>There are several tuning methods for optimising the MLs for accurate predictions. These approaches include grid and random search techniques, evolutionary algorithms or Bayesian optimisation. Generally, these methods are applied to optimise a single objective criterion. However, in applications where two or more objective functions (i.e. heating and cooling loads) are optimised, those approaches are not adequate to designate the behaviour of the ML, and the Pareto front of multiple criteria has to be considered.There are several tuning methods for optimising the MLs for accurate predictions.

        <p>The proposed method generates non-dominating solutions in which models accuracy in estimating heating and cooling loads are the highest. Furthermore, in a Grid search, it is not possible to search every potential value for the parameters in the grid due to the size of the vast search space. Therefore, as the hyper-parameters are discretely introduced to the grid, the chance of success of the optimisation algorithm, which smartly selects the values from predefined intervals is higher to build a model with more reliable accuracy. As such, S4 is suggested as the final set of parameters for modelling energy loads of the selected building dataset. Performance of the selected model tested using the 10-fold cross-validation over 5,000 randomly selected samples along with the results from Grid search, and the original study is summarised in Table 4. It can be seen that the selection of the right ML model and optimising the parameters using a Grid search method, the accuracy of predicting energy loads is considerably increased. The proposed MOO approach not only reduces the tuning time but also improves the performance of the models by precise tuning. The selection of 1,500 as the number of evolutionary algorithm iterations was based on a rule of thumb while the best model was identified at the 879th iteration. From two figures, it can be seen that there is a trade-off between accuracy and time complexity of the model. However, the results indicate that the sample size of 45,000 is sufficient for training a dependable model. With that record size, the model which is trained and tested at an average of 64.14 and 0.51 seconds achieves the RMSE of 6.97 and 4.61 kW h/m 2 for heating and cooling loads, respectively. It should be noted that this testing time relates to the forecasting of 4,500 samples.

        <p>The calculated confidence intervals at that point assure building a reliable model not only because the narrow band but also due to the fact that the data covers the space of possible values of the selected features for building design. Moreover, the use of 10-fold cross-validation and a random selection of records grantees a fair test procedure. Therefore, the upper bound of the RMSE in the presented graph can be considered as models' worst performance.The calculated confidence intervals at that point assure building a reliable model not only because the narrow band but also due to the fact that the data covers the space of possible values of the selected features for building design.

        <p>Due to the nature of RF models in training independent trees in which different feature set is selected, they are able to determine input variables importance in target estimation. This competency which is known as sensitivity analysis provides useful information in the analysis of the studied system. In this study, we fitted 30 RF model over 100,000 random building samples to generate a better empirical distribution of feature importance. Figure 10 illustrated the results of the sensitivity analysis of these RF models, which are configured based on the MOO algorithm outputs (best hyper-parameters set).Due to the nature of RF models in training independent trees in which different feature set is selected, they are able to determine input variables importance in target estimation.

        <p>In comparison with the results from training two different models for each of heating and cooling loads [6], it can be seen the important features in our model is a combination of those in two separate models. Moreover, the results indicate that prediction of heating loads mostly rely on building characteristics while cooling load forecasting depends on weather features.In comparison with the results from training two different models for each of heating and cooling loads [6], it can be seen the important features in our model is a combination of those in two separate models.

Although the advanced machine learning can ignore unimportant features despite the traditional statistical modelling, removing those from the data can reduce the model time complexity and slightly increase the accuracy. Table 5 presents the results of testing the model by removing the identified features. It can be seen that the RMSE fluctuations of the folds are also reduced compared to the original model.Here, the unimportant variables are 'аvrh', 'аvdni', 'iqrdni', 'iqrghi', 'mеdrh', 'sumdni', however, 'аvghi' and 'sumghi', which had an insignificant impact on modelling cooling loads still play a considerable role in this model.

        <p>This research addresses the issues regarding inaccurate modelling of building energy loads using ML techniques. As mentioned in the reviewed litera- The main advantages of this method over traditional approaches include a reduction in the time complexity of creating reliable models and improvements in the accuracy of predictions by fine-tuning of the ML models. The proposed approach was evaluated by implementing the random forest decision tree algorithm and testing the accuracy over a building data which was simulated using 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs>. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated through comparisons with conventional grid search methods and traditional statistical modelling. Generating an accurate model for calculation of the energy loads with fast and robust process paves the way for more informed and productive design decisions for built environments.

        <p>This study highlights the importance of features in predicting heating and cooling loads using the built-in mechanisms of RF models. The results showed how practically ML models can balance the influential variables on computing energy loads and ignore irrelevant ones without affecting the accu-racy. The importance of using ML techniques and model optimisation is more emphasised while complicated energy modelling (e.g. considering occupancy in estimations) using deep learning. By adding layers of learning models to extract complex relations in the data, the number of hyper-parameters and model sensitivity is considerably increased.This study highlights the importance of features in predicting heating and cooling loads using the built-in mechanisms of RF models.

        <p>The research highlights the potential of ML model-based techniques in modelling building energy indicators, which are sometimes laborious to simulate or calculate using engineering methods. It has been approximated that only three per cent of industrial data is currently being used in a meaningful way.

        <p>As policy tightens on inefficient energy consumption and our understanding of the limitations of BEM-led design decision-making, the necessity for more efficient and flexible models increases. Research over the last few years has been giving greater credence to designing buildings with consideration for medium-term climate change and any number of occupant presence or behaviour uncertainties. Every extension to the potential configurations exponentially inflates the problem space while likely reducing the conventional options solution space. Furthermore, these climate and utilisation properties are internal to BEMs, however, design and retrofit analysis is increasingly considering external and more challenging to integrate properties. The framework shown in this paper demonstrates that algorithmic decision-making capabilities are not nearing their limit and lays a foundation for more complex ML frameworks.As policy tightens on inefficient energy consumption and our understanding of the limitations of BEM-led design decision-making, the necessity for more efficient and flexible models increases.
