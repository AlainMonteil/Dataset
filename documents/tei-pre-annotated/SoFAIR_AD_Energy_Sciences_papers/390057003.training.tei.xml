        <p>Reducing transport emissions, in particular CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles, is a key element in mitigating the risk of climate change. Conventional welfare economics recommends the use of comprehensive pricing of carbon emissions, which may not necessarily be the most effective approach in transport systems. This paper uses an evolutionary technology diffusion model to simulate the impact of climate policies on passenger car emissions in the US, UK, Japan, China and India up to 2050, seeking to understand policy interaction. We analyse six commonly seen policy instruments and explore systematically the impact of combining each of these policies by developing 63 scenarios for the US, UK, China, Japan, and India. We assess both the policies' effectiveness in achieving emissions reductions and their cost-effectiveness in doing so. We show how the diffusion dynamics of the system can lead to interaction of policy levers, generating synergies in some cases (combined effectiveness more than the sum of its parts), and mutual impediment effects in others (combined effectiveness less than the sum of its parts). The paper identifies particular combinations of regulatory, procurement and fiscal policies that are particularly effective at generating rapid change without needing the use of very high fuel taxes or carbon pricing. Notably, combining electric vehicle mandates with taxes and regulations on combustion vehicles is highly effective, as it simultaneously improves the availability of low-carbon options while penalising high carbon options. Simple principles for policymaking can be inferred.</p>
        <p>The transport sector is the third greatest contributing sector to global carbon emissions [1] and was responsible for over 24% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2016. In particular, the passenger light-duty vehicle (PLDV) fleet is projected to expand from 900 million in 2012 to 1.7 billion in 2035 [2]. The rapid diffusion of electric vehicles (EVs) and improvements in the cost-effectiveness of non-electric car fleets is important in limiting energy demand growth by curbing oil use and limiting greenhouse (GHG) emissions [3,4].</p>
        <p>Understanding a suitable stringency and the structure of public policies is necessary to influence the adoption of new car technologies. Human-technology systems (or socio-technical regimes) possess inertia and display resistance to change, which makes them durable for multiple social, economic and technical reasons [5]. The transition to low emissions vehicle fleets may require diverse policy instruments that allow existing technologies in niches to diffuse into the market. The design, level, and structure of the instruments determine the effectiveness of the policies in achieving long-term emissions targets. In policy practice, diverse types of policies are almost always introduced simultaneously, aiming to control different types of externalities (e.g. fuel use, road use, emissions). These incentives likely interact in ways not always fully understood, providing price and regulatory signals for purchase decisions and use behaviours, thereby compounding their effect on the transition to low-emission vehicles.</p>
        <p>The impacts of the policies are typically heterogeneous across countries and time, and can be non-linear, partly due to the inherent high heterogeneity of markets [6]. Some consumer markets are less likely to adopt low-emission technology until a certain critical mass is reached. Particular combinations of policies could be more effective in overcoming technological lockins and decarbonising private transport than others. This must be understood when designing new frameworks aiming at rapid decarbonisation.</p>
        <p>Many studies consider one policy in isolation (e.g. [7,8]). Of the studies exploring policy packages, most have looked at the integrated impact of policy mixes in achieving deep CO2 emissions reductions [9][10][11]. Although a few studies have examined the interaction of policies [12][13][14], these studies predominantly have investigated the impact of policy interactions in the US and Canada.</p>
        <p>However, no studies have comparatively explored interaction effects between policies across multiple countries. Similarly, none have examined whether the same insights hold between developed nations (e.g. the US, the UK, Japan) and large, emerging economies (e.g. China, India) with high-demand growth. Thus, insights offered by recent research have remained tied to national contexts, and are difficult to translate.</p>
        <p>In the transport literature, significant consideration has been given to the synergies and tradeoffs between policies [15]. There are trade-off (or reinforcement) effects between two policies if the presence of two policies offers a smaller (or larger) CO2 mitigation benefit than the sum of the effectiveness of either policy alone. This study aims to quantify the trade-offs and synergies that exist between policies for mitigating CO2 emissions from passenger cars in the five major economies: the US, the UK, China, India and Japan. These countries have been chosen for this study because their vehicle markets possess very different characteristics, which are the results of different histories of policies and regulations, and they also constitute a major component of the global car fleet [6]. This comparative study enables us to examine how the structures of different car markets influence the levels of policy stringencies necessary to induce transitions in current passenger car systems. In this paper, the higher the policy stringency, the higher the cost of the policy for the consumers (taxes) and the government (EV subsidy). In the same manner, the more stringent the EV mandate, the more ambitious the EV target sales. We discuss possible options available to policymakers to minimize trade-off effects and maximize synergies in policy design. In pursuit of these objectives, this paper addresses the following questions:</p>
        <p>1) Can an evolutionary model of vehicle fleets predict and explain trade-off or reinforcement effects between any existing types of policy instruments on the diffusion of PLDVs in each of the five countries? How significant are the trade-off and reinforcement effects on overall incentives?</p>
        <p>2) How do the trade-off and reinforcement effects between policy instruments affect the costs and efficiencies of the policy combinations, and can this be used to guide policy design?</p>
        <p>To answer these questions, we performed scenario analysis using the FTT:Transport model, an evolutionary technology diffusion model for road transport technology, as a submodule of the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) named E3ME-FTT-GENIE (see [9]). The Future Technology Transformations (FTT) family of models consists of FTT:Power [16], FTT:Transport [9], FTT:Heat [17] and FTT:Steel [18]. The purpose of the design of the FTT models is to simulate the evolution of fleets through technology diffusion dynamics that follow standard theory on the diffusion of innovations [19]. The model makes use of coupled S-shaped curve (non-equilibrium) dynamics, driven by agent decisions, following preferences, decision rules and perceived incentives, calibrated to reproduce observed technology trajectories. The FTT models use a modified evolutionary version of discrete choice theory in which social influence is integrated [20]. Its strong path-dependence and high policy resolution allow explicit assessment of policy interactions, with a modelling horizon of 2050. The paper is structured in comparative form, and aims to unearth general principles for low-carbon policymaking that are context-independent in path-dependent transport systems.</p>
        <p>The algorithm used is based on a simulation of dynamical systems, as opposed to the systems optimization frequently used in technology models. The FTT models enable modelling of technological diversity, heterogeneous consumer decision-making and the complex evolving interactions between policies. The FTT:Transport model offers a highly detailed set of policy packages, and allows the modelling of different transition pathways that then lead to different future technology scenarios [9].</p>
        <p>The remaining paper is structured in the following manner: Section 2 provides a literature review of previous research on the analysis of policies. Section 3 discusses existing policies for encouraging low emission vehicles in the five major economies. Section 4 describes the model and methodology used to perform the scenario analysis. Section 5 details the variables and data sources used in this study. Section 6 provides the assumptions for the scenario analysis. Section 7 presents the results of this scenario analysis and discusses their policy implications. Section 8 offers insights for policymakers, and finally, section 9 provides a conclusion.</p>
        <p>The scenarios most often assessed by the IPCC have primarily focused on harmonised carbon pricing/taxing as a policy strategy [21]. Focusing on transport, other studies have analysed the mid-to long-term impacts of various individual policy instruments on the CO2 emissions from the PLDV sector using quantitative models [8,13,[23][24][25][26][27][28][29]. Most studies have only examined the impacts of various taxes on long term CO 2 emissions. For instance, Kloess et al. [24] investigated the effect of various tax incentives and technological progress on the Austrian passenger car fleet. Using the UK Transport model, Brand et al. [30] assessed the long-term scenario of several low-carbon fiscal policies, such as vehicle purchase taxes, road taxes and scrappage programs, as well as their effects on CO 2 emissions from the PLDVs.</p>
        <p>The zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates have existed only in the US and some regions of Canada. Sykes and Axsen [13] examined the impact of the ZEV mandate on the long term sales in North America using CIMS-ZEV. Karplus et al. [8] studied the cost and effectiveness of fuel economy standards, alone and in conjunction with economy-wide policies constraining GHG emissions. Small [31] assessed the cost and effectiveness of fuel tax, vehicle efficiency standards, and financial subsidies on CO2 emissions reduction from passenger light-duty vehicles in the US with the National Energy Modelling System (NEMS). Morrow et al. [23] analysed fuel taxes, continued increases in fuel economy standards, and purchased tax credits for new vehicle purchases, as well as the impact of combining these policies to reduce GHG emissions and oil consumption in the US transportation sector. Outside North America, studies have only analysed the impacts of various financial incentives on developed countries. Thus, as discussed above, many studies on policy instrument analysis have focused on studying the impact of one instrument on a particular country [25,32,33]. However, individual policy instruments have limited effectiveness or must be unrealistically stringent, whereas the combination of instruments can be more effective. In fact, a more integrated policy mix of strong policies is required for deep GHG emissions [34]. Even when studies consider the impact of several policy instruments, they tend to focus on the collective impact of the policy instruments on CO 2 emissions [10,23,29], while ignoring the interactions among the policy instruments on the emissions of PLDVs. Despite the prevalence of policy mixes in many nations and regions [35], very little transportation research has studied policy interactions, particularly for policy mixes for light-duty vehicles [15]. While it is important to examine the overall impact of a group of policies, the interactions among the policy instruments are central to any policy mix because of their collective influence on the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of instruments in the mix, and thus the design of the policy strategy [19,36,37].</p>
        <p>When systems are path-dependent, and various policies are combined, they can be either mutually reinforcing or work against one another, depending on how they are designed and implemented [38]. For example, policies focusing on improving vehicle choice availability (technology push) can reinforce the impact of policies influencing pricing (technology pull) [39]. In other words, there can be synergies or interference effects between instruments, and it is thus important to understand the effects of policy interactions. The design of an effective policy package requires an understanding of policy interactions [34]. Several studies have discussed the possible impacts of policy synergies and policy mixes on the effectiveness and the impacts of policies regarding emissions reductions in the energy sector [13,34,36,37]. However, few studies go beyond qualitative statements. An exception is a study by Viguié and Hallegatte [42], which provides a multicriteria analysis on the trade-off and synergies of various urban climate policies, such as zoning and public transport subsidies. Elsewhere, Fischer and Fox [43] carried out scenario analysis on carbon taxes and rebates for mitigating carbon leakage. More specific to light-duty vehicles, Axsen and Wolinetz [44] simulated the impact of incentives and mandate-based strategy on plug-in EV sales in Canada. Jenn et al. [12] examined the individual and combined effect of light-duty vehicle GHG emission standards and the Zero Emissions Vehicle policy in the US. Thus, we identify two main gaps in existing studies for the analysis of policy instruments on long-term CO2 emissions. First, existing studies, as we have illustrated, have focused on studying policies for only one country or region. Although this approach is useful in understanding the impact of policies on a certain country, it does not allow for the inference of impact for other countries, or explain why or under what conditions the policies would be effective and be cost-efficient. Second, many existing studies have been ex-post policy evaluation studies. None of these studies examine the interactions between multiple policies within the PLDV sector using a dynamic model. A comparative study of policy interactions across several countries with different characteristics is required to provide insights into policy actions in passenger road transport.</p>
        <p>The levels and designs of incentives vary greatly across our case study countries. This section summarises the main policy objectives and policies that have been implemented in the UK, the US, Japan, China, and India to encourage the diffusion of low-emission vehicles.</p>
        <p>The UK has adopted a target of net-zero emissions for 2050, which includes transport [45]. The EU first established a law requiring new cars registered in the EU to emit no more than an average of 130 grams of CO 2 per kilometre (gCO 2 /km) by 2015. By 2021, the average fleet target for new cars is 95 grams of CO 2 per kilometre. From 2021 onwards, assuming some minimum degree of regulatory alignment with the EU for transport, the average emissions of all newly registered cars of a manufacturer must be below that target [46]. Vehicle Excise Duty (VED), also commonly known as vehicle road tax, is an annual tax levied on vehicles using public roads. Typically, it is levied on the basis of vehicle characteristics, such as engine size, weight, or power. More recently, the CO 2 -graded VED was recalibrated with higher band resolution and slightly higher duties [30]. In addition to the exemption from the VED, in the UK, the electric car (plug-in car) grant is intended to incentivise electric car purchases by offering 4,500 GBP toward the purchase of an electric car (plug-in car) on a zeroemission range of at least 70 miles [45].</p>
        <p>The transport sector has surpassed the power sector as the single largest US emitter of GHGs for the first time since 2016. Following the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, 24 states formed the US Climate Alliance and will uphold the original US commitment, reducing emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 [47]. This could change again if the US rejoins the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>Since 2011, the federal government has offered an income tax credit to owners of fuel-efficient vehicles, ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 per vehicle, based on each vehicle's traction, battery capacity and gross vehicle weight rating [48].</p>
        <p>The Energy Tax Act of 1978 requires car companies to pay a 'Gas Guzzler' tax on the sale of cars (excluding light trucks and SUVs) with exceptionally low fuel economy. Under the Obama Administration's standards, the auto industry was required to double the fuel economy of vehicles to an average of approximately 54 miles per gallon by 2050. However, more recently, under the Trump administration, the EPA has been considering freezing the fuel-efficiency targets at 2020 levels [49].</p>
        <p>Many states and local governments offer a wide variety of incentives beyond what the federal government requires. These incentives take many forms, including rebates, income tax credits, sales tax exemptions, and fee exemptions. Among all the non-fiscal policies that have an obvious bias towards NEVs, the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) credit mandate in California is the most representative incentive. It sets minimum sale percentages of ZEVs and credits to be given to the manufacturers based on vehicle type and all-electric range [50,51].</p>
        <p>Japan has pledged a 26% emissions reduction in GHG below 2013 levels by 2030, including the transport sector [52]. In 1998, Japan initiated the Top Runner Approach, which has set mandatory efficiency standards for automobiles based on the most efficient products. By 2015, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that the new standard to be achieved by passenger cars was 12.7-23.5 km/L. If these numerical targets in the new standards are successfully achieved, fuel efficiency in the target fiscal year (FY) of 2022 will improve by 26.1% from the actual level in FY2012 [53].</p>
        <p>There are nine different taxes for owning cars in Japan, including acquisition tax, consumption tax, tonnage tax, automobile tax, gasoline tax, diesel tax, LPG tax, and in-use consumption tax [54]Zero-emissions vehicles are exempt from both the acquisition and the tonnage tax. The owners of cars that are compliant with the 2015 FES enjoy up to an 80% reduction in acquisition tax, and a 75% reduction in automobile tonnage tax [54].</p>
        <p>Under the Paris Agreement, China committed itself to reach peak carbon emissions around 2030. More recently, President Xi announced a net-zero emissions target for 2060, thus current policy regimes are likely to change. Meanwhile, the transport sector has become one of China's fastest-growing economic sectors [55]. At the national level, to reduce its dependency on foreign oil and to encourage more fuel-efficient vehicle technologies, the passenger vehicle market has been subject to fuel economy standards since 2004. The Chinese government also provides direct subsidies for the purchase of EVs at both central and local levels. According to the driving mileage of vehicles, the EV purchaser can receive up to RMB 55,000 (USD 8,000) in subsidies from the central government. However, in 2019, China's Ministry of Finance announced its plan to reduce by half subsidies for EVs sold in the country with driving ranges of 400 or more kilometres to RMB 250,000 (USD 3,600) [56]. Beyond this, many local governments provide additional subsidies. For example, in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Beijing, owners of certain EVs (with ranges above 250km) can receive subsidies of up to RMB 110,000 (USD 17,000). EVs are also exempt from various taxes and regulations, such as purchase tax, license lottery (in Beijing and Guangzhou), and toll charges [57]. The New-Energy Vehicle Credit Program was finalized in September 2017 and was implemented in 2018. Under the NEV credit program, car manufacturers with over 30,000 annual vehicle sales in the country are required to produce 10% NEVs in 2019 and 12% in 2020 [58]. Companies that do not reach their quotas will face fines, but they could buy credits from manufacturers having a surplus.</p>
        <p>India's NDC sets a target for reducing emissions by 33% to 35% between 2005 and 2030. The transport sector is a key area for meeting this goal [59]. To promote eco-friendly vehicles, in 2015, the Indian government launched the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles) measure to incentivise HEV and EV purchases. Under FAME India, the Indian government will provide incentives from Rs. 138,000 (USD 2,000) for every electric car sold [60]. In addition to subsidies for new energy technologies, excise duties are levied depending on the sizes, engine types, and whether the vehicles are new energy technology vehicles. For EVs, India has reduced the excise duty from 8% for conventional cars, to 4% for EVs [61]. In addition, individual states have their own incentives for energy-efficient vehicles. The Government of India set the first fuel economy standards for the nation in 2014. This standard set a fleet target of 130gCO2/km, which came into effect in 2017. It proposed that the standard could tighten to 113gCO2/km by 2022 [62].</p>
        <p>The Future Technology Transformation (FTT) model is a loose framework method that models technological diffusion dynamically, based on technological competition in markets. The FTT:Transport model assumes the presence of an adaptive, evolving, path-dependent market with heterogeneous agents. We assume revealed preferences, in that the observed cost distribution for recent vehicle sales corresponds to the heterogeneity of consumer preferences and choices (see [6,9] for details).</p>
        <p>The FTT framework models technological diffusion by a set of logistic differential equations of the Lotka-Volterra family, which represent gradual technological substitution processes [16]. Under the FTT framework, consumers are more likely to choose a technology that has a higher market share as a result of availability, visibility, social influence and network effects, all of which we represent combined simply as adoptions proportional to current market shares (see Equation 1). It is well established that these bandwagon effects substantially influence the profiles of diffusion of vehicle models [63,64]. As shown in Appendix B.6, if one adds bandwagon effects such as social influence in a discrete choice model, one obtains a Lotka-Volterra (replicator dynamics) evolutionary system that generates S-shaped curves [20]. Following evolving choices and preferences, a flow of market shares exists from arbitrary technology category ! towards category ", denoted as follows:</p>
        <p>A reverse flow also exists from technology " to technology !, as shown here:</p>
        <p>(1)</p>
        <p>∆% !→# denotes the flow of shares from car technology ! to ", ' is the turnover rate for cars and ∆, is an arbitrary time span. ( #! )∆* #! + represents the fraction of agents that prefer technology " over ! based on the difference in mean generalized cost of technology " and !. The shape of ( #! )∆* #! + is derived from the cost-distribution curves that correspond to the heterogeneity of consumer choices (see Appendix B.5.2). The FTT:Transport model assumes the presence of a diverse market with heterogeneous agents. This is accomplished by using a probabilistic treatment of consumer decision-making and by using a distribution of cost values. We obtained the price data of every single model type sold in each country and matched the price data (e.g. car price, fuel cost) to the sales of that car model (see Appendix B.5.1, Fig. B3), unlike traditional models that take 'representative car model(s)'. We assume that the cost distribution corresponds to the heterogeneity of consumer choices as a result of revealed preferences obtained in this rich dataset (see Appendix B.5.2). The rate of diffusion for one car technology is influenced by the width of the cost distribution for each segment of car technology and the market share of the technology (Equation 1). Hence, a policy (e.g. EV subsidy) does not lead to an instant diffusion of the target vehicles (e.g. EVs). Consumers do not respond to the incentives simultaneously (see Appendix B.5.2). Based on technological path dependence, the higher the current market share, the faster the rate of diffusion will be for those target vehicles. Hence, the effectiveness of a policy may be different across different markets, depending on market shares, and the heterogeneity of the market. Capital costs (car prices) are influenced by learning curves, typically stronger for new technologies, reinforcing diffusion [9]. Hence, the capital costs for vehicle technologies (/ # (,)) fall by a certain percentage (learning rate 2 # ) every time the total quantity manufactured 3 # (,) doubles:</p>
        <p>'( ! Purchase decisions are affected by four components: consumer preference, government policies, market environment and each car model's availability. Each of these components leads to a dynamic change of market share using the Future Technology Transformation (FTT) framework. Notably, a substantial source of path-dependence in the model originates from the fact that the availability of vehicles endogenously evolves in the model: the more a car model is available, the more it is purchased. The more it is purchased, the more it is noticed and demanded, and the more it is made available. The diffusion of innovations always follows this basic mechanism [19,20]. CO2 emissions from passenger vehicles are defined as follows:</p>
        <p>7 ),* = 8 ),* * *: +),* In which 8 ),* is the demand for transport service for technology ;, determined by market shares of technology ; (discussed above) and the total demand for passenger car transport (see Appendix B.1). 7 ),* is the amount of fleet emissions in Gt/yr, and *: +),* is the emissions factor.</p>
        <p>Financial incentives such as EV subsidies, road tax and fuel tax have been adopted by all of the countries in this study (i.e. the UK, the US, Japan, China and India). Besides financial incentives, fuel economy standards require automakers to design more efficient vehicles or to shift sales toward more efficient models. To boost the population of zero emissions vehicles, a cap-and-trade EV mandate has been introduced in some states in the US (e.g. California) and China, and this has the potential to rapidly scale EV manufacturing and adoption [51,65]. For that reason, all of these policy types must be represented in all of the countries in the model. In this paper, policy formulations take six possible forms: vehicle tax, annual registration tax, EV subsidy, fuel tax, EV mandate, and fuel economy standards.</p>
        <p>In the FTT:Transport model, the cost of operating a vehicle is calculated using what we termed the Levelised Cost of Transportation (LCOT) [12]:</p>
        <p>In which / # , ( # and ?@ # are the mean capital costs (in USD), fuel cost (in USD/litre) and maintenance cost (in USD/km), respectively. 7A% # represents EV subsidies, paid to car purchasers (and therefore, negative cost) at the purchase time. (= # is the fuel tax, in USD/litre. The fuel cost depends on fuel consumption ((7 # ) and the distance travelled each year (B"C, * ). @= # (,) is the annual registration tax, which is vehicle/class-specific, paid by car owners (,)once per year. *( # is the capacity factor, km/y. This represents the breakeven cost of transportation per unit of distance, which is comparable across choices when buying a vehicle. All pecuniary policies influence this quantity in the model; however, due to consumer discounting, different types of taxes are not exactly equivalent, according to how they arise through time.</p>
        <p>The intangibles include the components that are valued by consumers to satisfy personal needs (e.g. comfort, speed). An intangible cost is calculated by minimising the difference in slopes between the projected market shares and the historical market shares. The values of the intangibles are empirical parameters that we obtained from making the FTT diffusion trajectory match the trajectory observed in our historical data at the year of the beginning of the simulation (see Appendix B.5.4 for more information). The derivations for the 'intangibles' and the uncertainty analysis are presented in Appendix B.5.4.2.</p>
        <p>Fuel economy regulation is modelled by influencing the flow of share values in the technology category. In the presence of a fuel economy regulation, we assume that there are no new market shares gained in the categories being phased out. In the FTT:Transport model, the flow of market shares from technology j to technology " is as follows:</p>
        <p>In a hypothetical case where conventional petrol cars are phased out, we assume that ( #! is 0 so that there can no longer be any gain in market shares for conventional petrol cars.</p>
        <p>For EV mandates, it is assumed that the policies exogenously change the shares of vehicle types at a specific point in time. 5 We assume that market shares flow from conventional cars ! to EVs " by assigning exogenous shares to ∆%7 !→# . For example, assuming that E% of the new car sales have to be EVs; then</p>
        <p>53//* (7) This approach models mandates with targets that require specific percentages of EV sales. Our approach is not exactly the same as some of the real-world EV mandates, for which the government sets an EV production quota (e.g. the China New Energy Vehicle [NEV] mandate and the California ZEV mandate program) or assigns a NEV credit. However, this approach resembles the impact of EV mandates for which the government intends to foster the diffusion of EVs by increasing the shares of EVs sold. Here we interpret the EV mandate much like if it were a public purchasing program forcing an exogenous diffusion of the technology.</p>
        <p>By definition, the effectiveness of public policies is defined as the extent to which policy goals are achieved. In the present context, the effectiveness of a given policy on CO 2 emissions is defined as the amount of abatement achieved by a given policy: 7GGHI,"JHKHCC = ∑ ∫ )7 *,#,4 -7 *,#,% +N, +%6% +%78 # (8) where 7 *,#,4 is the emissions sum over all technologies " between the years 2016 and 2050 under scenario s, when policies are imposed. 7 *,#,% is the emissions sum over all technologies between the years 2016 and 2050, without any policies in the counterfactual baseline scenario. The effectiveness index captures the potential effects of a policy across technologies and the cumulative emissions reduction achieved by a particular policy.</p>
        <p>In the FTT model, each layer of policy plays a specific role in the decarbonisation of the transport sector. When the policies are simultaneously simulated in the model, they influence the each other's effectiveness. For example, taxing high-emission vehicles with a vehicle tax will encourage consumers to purchase low-emission vehicles. In a consumer market with limited EV models available, a consumer will be more likely to choose a lower-emission petrol car, due to the path-dependent nature of the model (Equation 1). However, in the presence of the EV mandate, manufacturers are encouraged to produce more EVs and to offer more options to consumers. The higher EV shares in the FTT model lead to a higher rate of diffusion for EV, considering the S-shaped technological diffusion curve (Equation 1). Hence, policy interactions emerge endogenously in the FTT:Transport model. With different current market shares and cost distributions (see Appendix B.5.1, Fig. B3) for different countries, consumers respond to policies differently across different markets.</p>
        <p>To study the interactions between policies, we simultaneously implement the policies in the model. We define the interactions between policies in terms of the total effectiveness minus the effectiveness of individual policies to measure whether certain combinations achieve more or less than their individual components:</p>
        <p>where /K,(E1, E2) is the interaction between two policies, 7GG(E1, E2) is the total effectiveness of two policies, 7GG(E1) and 7GG(E2) are the effectiveness of policies E1 and E2, respectively, when two policies are both present and used simultaneously. We cannot isolate the impacts of either policy in a scenario where they are both present and interacting simultaneously. /K,(E1, E2) is positive if there is a reinforcement effect between two policies and /K,(E1, E2) is negative if there is a trade-off effect between two policies. In this paper, the sizes of the reinforcement effect and the trade-off effect are determined by the magnitude of /K,(E1, E2). Hence, the larger the reinforcement effect is, the larger the 'additional effectiveness' will be in reducing CO2 emissions for combining two policies in a package (see Equation 8for the definition of policy effectiveness). If policies do not interact, /K,(E1, E2) =0 and 7GG(E1, E2)= 7GG(E1)+ 7GG(E2). Note that this calculation requires three FTT simulations, and since they are path-dependent, this implies the comparison of three independent storylines, which could differ across several dimensions.</p>
        <p>We consider the cost of a policy in three dimensions: the cost to consumers (ConsumerCost), the cost to the Exchequer (e.g. EV subsidies) (ExchequerCost), and the cost to manufacturers (MCost) (e.g. for fuel economy standards and EV mandates). For clarity, we assume that the costs are positive for individual parties/groups. For example, we assume that the annual registration tax is a positive cost to car owners and not a negative cost to the government. This approach captures how the costs of policies vary as a result of the different levels of policies. Hence, we have: =Q,*QC, = *QKCRSHT*QC, + 7EIℎHWRHT*QC, + ?*QC, (10) The cost-effectiveness of a policy is equal to the change in the cumulative emissions as a result of the policy (7GGHI,"JHKHCC) divided by the total cost of the policy (=Q,*QC,). Notably, we do not include any discounting in the cost calculation. Hence, we have the following: *QC, HGGHI,"JHKHCC = 9::/;*#&lt;/=/44 &gt;?*@?4* (11) The methodology for calculating the cost for each policy is documented in Appendix D.</p>
        <p>For the present study, an extensive original database detailing the technological profile of cars and populations was built. The 2016 data for new registration per vehicle model type were obtained from MarkLines [66] and matched to recent prices and car specifications, extracted from the official websites of the manufacturers. Data gathering for FTT:Transport is described in detail in [9].</p>
        <p>The data sources and key parameters for the FTT:Transport model are presented in Appendix A.1 (Table A1) and Appendix A.2 (Table A3-A7), respectively.</p>
        <p>In this study, policies are first tested individually, and then we combine the policies to assess the interactions between policies. The scenarios are modelled to demonstrate the impact of individual policies and combinations of policies on CO2 emissions until 2050. The analysis consists of 63 scenarios, including all possible policy combinations of six commonly seen policies for five countries. Table 1 provides an overview of these scenarios. Policy assumptions for the scenarios are presented in Table 2. Under individual policy scenarios, policy measures that have already been implemented will continue to be used in the future with the same dynamics, but with increased stringency. In this paper, policy stringency is defined as a higher price of CO2 mitigation. For taxes, a higher price per unit of CO2 implies higher stringency. A higher subsidy is interpreted as more stringent than a lower subsidy. Larger improvements in fuel efficiency for new cars imply more stringent fuel economy regulations. In addition, an EV mandate is more stringent when the government sets a higher EV sales target.</p>
        <p>Assuming that policies will become more stringent in the future, financial incentives will be 50% higher than those of the current policies in individual countries. 6 We assume that passenger car owners/operators would pay a registration fee/vehicle tax based on engine size or their emissions, consistent with existing policies around the world. Zero emission vehicles such as EVs will be exempt from paying car acquisition taxes (VT) until 2050. The amount of EV subsidies depends on battery size and EV ranges. We assume that EV subsidies would be phased out by 2040.</p>
        <p>Following the proposals by the EU and US, in the 'fuel economy regulation scenario', we assume that current inefficient petrol cars and diesel cars would be phased out in 2025, replaced by more advanced models featuring additional innovations designed to reduce energy use and emissions. Beyond this, we assume that the fuel economy for the advanced petrol and diesel cars is 30% higher than that of the current petrol cars in the UK, and 20% higher than that in the US. Since the long-term fuel economy standards (up to 2030) for Japan, China and India have not yet been recorded/published, we used adopted fuel economy standards in our analysis. Hence, in the 'fuel economy regulation scenario', we assume that current petrol and diesel cars in China, India, and Japan would be phased out by 2030. Instead, they would be replaced by advanced petrol and diesel cars that will be 35% more efficient than the current petrol cars in China, and 20% more efficient than those in Japan and India, as shown in Table 2.</p>
        <p>Since the EV mandate is absent in the UK, India and Japan, we assume that these would be introduced and that their stringencies would be the same for other countries such as China, for scenario analysis purposes. Under the EV mandate scenario, we assume that 10% of new car sales are EV, consistent with the level China proposed beginning in the year 2019. For the purpose of scenario analysis, we assume that the level of EV mandates would remain constant until 2050. We acknowledge that EV mandates could become more stringent over time. Thus, a more stringent scenario is tested and demonstrated in Appendix G. Notably, in the FTT:Transport model, the initial diffusion of EVs will lead to further EV diffusion. This implies that EV mandates can be removed after a certain sales threshold is reached.</p>

        <p>This section analyses the effectiveness of individual policies when these incentives are introduced independently (without interactions) for different countries. Tables 3 and4 show the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of individual policies.</p>
        <p>Among financial incentives, the annual registration tax is the most effective in all the countries. This is because the total cost of the annual registration tax is among the highest of all policies. For example, in the US, the annual registration tax is USD 600 per year under the high registration tax scenario. For buyers that hold on to their cars for 10 years, this amounts to USD 6,000 over the lifetime of a car.</p>
        <p>Comparatively, the effectiveness of financial incentives is the lowest in India. This is because the shares for EVs and hybrid cars are still minimal in India. When the shares for new energy technologies are small, the rate of diffusion is low because many people do not have access to EVs or an EV infrastructure and perhaps do not trust EVs (e.g. range anxiety). In such a situation, financial incentives affect only a very small subset of all vehicle owners.</p>
        <p>Among the five countries studied, the EV subsidy is the most effective in China, leading to 420 MtCO2 cumulative emissions reductions. In contrast, the diffusion of EVs as a result of EV subsidies has a minimal effect on the total emissions in the PLDV sector in India and Japan. In India, this is because the shares for EVs are very small (less than 0.1%) despite the presence of EV subsidies, which is the lowest among all of the countries. Similarly, while the shares for EVs are higher in Japan than India, the shares for EVs (in the car fleet) in Japan were still below 0.3% in 2018, and 1% in 2019 in China. The lower the market shares are for the technologies, the larger the lock-in effect is in the FTT model, and the lower the rate of technological diffusion is.</p>
        <p>The cost-effectiveness of individual policies (2016 USD/tCO2).</p>
        <p>Note: the values are the average costs per tCO2 avoided. Therefore, when the shares for the new energy technologies are small, we find that EV mandates are more effective than financial incentives. As shown in Table 3, cumulative emissions are reduced by more than 1000 MtCO2 in India. Since there are more first-time car buyers in India, we assume that there are proportionally more new cars in India than elsewhere, and that the India's effective turnover rate (or buying rate) would therefore be higher than in developed countries. In fact, we find that the EV mandate is the most cost-effective policy in reducing emissions and encouraging the diffusion of EVs in all countries. This finding contradicts the economic theory that taxes (or technology-neutral policies) are more costeffective than technology-specific strategies [67], such as the EV mandate. We argue that in the presence of market and infrastructure failure within the transport sector, without technologically specific policies, consumer choices could not be incentivised collectively by an externality price.</p>
        <p>Our results differ from the findings of Fox et al. [68] that tax scenario is more cost-effective than technology-specific standards such as EV mandates. These differences stem from the strong path-dependence structure in the FTT:Transport model. In the present study, we assume that the EV mandate has a plateau, instead of becoming more stringent over time (as assumed by Fox et al. [68]). In the FTT:Transport model, once the EV reaches a certain market share, the technology will take off without more stringent EV mandates.</p>
        <p>Under the 'fuel economy scenario assumptions', advanced petrol and advanced diesel cars penetrate the market, replacing conventional petrol cars and diesel cars. Among the US, Japan, and India, we find that the fuel economy regulation is more effective in the US. This is because there are a large number of luxury petrol cars (i.e. engine size 2000cc and above, such as SUVs) in the baseline scenario in the US. Thus, we find that as a result of the 'fuel economy scenario assumptions', cumulative emissions fall by more than 2000 MtCO2 in the US.</p>
        <p>In this section, we study how the effectiveness of policies changes when two policies are combined. Overall, we find that the sum of the effectiveness of two policies is generally not equal to the sum of the effectiveness of policies applied individually, but it could be either smaller (trade-off effect) or larger (reinforcement effect) than two policies implemented on their own, depending on the structure and levels of policies (Fig. 2). The cost of each policy combination (Table 6) and the average cost for each policy combination (average efficiencies) are shown in Fig. 3. Thus, we conclude two main observations from the scenario analysis.</p>
        <p>First, we generally find a trade-off effect between the various types of financial incentives under this analysis (as shown in the red bars of Fig. 2), whereas the degree of the trade-off effect depends on the stringency of individual policies in each country. This is because financial incentives are charged based on the fuel economy (e.g. fuel tax) or engine size (e.g. annual registration tax). If consumers are incentivised to buy more energy-efficient PLDVs because of one of the incentives, the 'additional effectiveness' of adding more financial incentives will be lower because the costs (of pairing incentives) for consumers of more efficient cars will be less than those for consumers with less efficient cars. For instance, when a car buyer chooses a more efficient vehicle as a result of the annual registration tax, the effectiveness of a fuel tax falls as the fuel economy improves. Hence, we find that in all countries, there is a trade-off effect between annual registration tax, vehicle tax, fuel tax and EV subsidy.</p>
        <p>Fig. 3 shows that, in general, the costs of two financial policies in combination are higher than the average cost of two policies. This finding, to some degree, confirms the principle of welfare economics that only one tax should be used at a time to maximise cost-effectiveness. Overall, when the combination of policies is not sufficiently effective, these policies could result in very high costs per ton CO2 emission reduction. For instance, in the case of Japan, the average cost and combination cost of vehicle tax and EV subsidy are both over 6000 USD/ton CO2 emission reduction (Table 5).</p>
        <p>The interaction effect between two policies. When the interaction effect is positive, there is a reinforcement effect between the two policies. When the interaction effect is negative, there is a trade-off effect between two policies. Second, there is a reinforcement effect between EV mandates and other policies, as shown in the green bars in Fig. 2. Hence, the costs of combining EV mandates and their pairing policies (except for the EV subsidy) are lower than the average costs of two policies, the extent of which depends on the reinforcement effects between the two policies (Fig. 3). Thus, one could see the EV mandate as an 'enabling' policy, enhancing the effects of other policies. The size of the reinforcement effect depends on specific countries and the magnitude of the policies. In 1 particular, the interaction effects are among 2 the largest between annual registration taxes and EV mandates, as well as between fuel 8 economy regulations and EV mandates. The EV mandates increase the availability and 9 visibility of EVs. A higher availability of EVs enables the other policies to have stronger effects 10 by giving a broader range of choice to consumers. Notably, it is implicitly assumed for clarity 11 that the higher availability of EVs would be accompanied by wider deployment of the charging 12 infrastructure. Regulations or policies that increase the EV fleet shares by imposing long-term 13 fleet emissions targets for vehicle manufacturers are also essential. 14 In reality, there are likely to be more than two combined policies (since most policy frameworks already include more than two policies). The following section extends our conclusions for two policy interactions to the scenarios with three to six policies.</p>
        <p>In this section, we study the interactions between multiple policy instruments applied simultaneously by adding policies to the existing two-policy mixes and examining the changes in interactions between policies. The objective of this exercise is to understand how the tradeoff and synergetic effects between policy strategies evolve, and the implications of the interactions between multiple policies on policymaking. Here we will focus on three-policy mixes (Tables 7-8 and Fig. 4), as more complex mixes could logically be inferred from these results. We show results for four to six policy mixes in Tables E1-E6 in Appendix E.</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. 4, in most cases, the effectiveness of three policies combinations (the grey bars) are higher than two policy combinations. When three policies are combined, consistent with two policy combinations, trade-offs originate from combining multiple financial policies, while synergies arise from combining policies with the 'enabling' EV mandates, multiplying their impact.</p>
        <p>The overall trade-off effects of three policy combinations are larger than those trade-off effects of two policy combinations, due to the accumulation of trade-off effects between pairs of policies. However, we observe that the overall trade-off effects of three policy combinations are smaller than the sum of the trade-off effects of individual pairs. The explanation for this finding is that the additional financial incentive (e.g. EV subsidy) increases the shares for low emissions vehicles (e.g. EVs) slightly, and this encourages more people to purchase EVs with the same policy combinations improves the effectiveness of the policy package. Hence, the cost of three policy combinations is smaller than the average cost of individual pairs, as shown in Table 7. It is more cost-effective to combine three financial incentives than pairing financial incentives. This result is contrary to what is predicted by welfare economics, that there are more penalties the more instruments are used. In the FTT:Transport model, due to the interactions between policies, the introduction of another layer of policy could improve the overall effectiveness of the 'policy package', and thereby improve the cost-effectiveness of the original policy combination.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in the cases of four-and five-policy combinations, in the absence of an EV mandate, we observe that while the overall trade-off effects increase with the number of policies, the overall trade-off effects are smaller than the sum of the trade-off effects of individual pairs. For example, the trade-off effects between fuel tax, EV subsidies, vehicle tax, and fuel economy standards are smaller than the trade-off effect when the registration tax is added to the policy package for all of the countries (Tables E1 andE3 of Appendix E). This is because in the FTT model, due to path dependency (see Equation 1), when the shares for EV are very low (as assumed in most countries), and the original policy package (four policy package) does not lead to significant change in the diffusion pathway, addition policies such as annual registration tax offers limited benefits for significantly reducing emissions.</p>
        <p>The interaction effect between three policies. When the interaction effect is positive, there is a reinforcement effect between the two policies. When the interaction effect is negative, there is a tradeoff effect between two policies.</p>
        <p>The interaction effect of three policies (MtCO2) In the presence of EV mandates, when three policies are combined, we find that there are always reinforcement effects between policies. Hence, the costs of three-policy combinations in the presence of an EV mandate are smaller than combinations of financial policies in the absence of an EV mandate. Moreover, the cost-effectiveness is the highest when the EV mandate is combined with fuel economy regulation and an EV subsidy for the US, the UK, Japan, and India. However, the sizes of the overall reinforcement effects are smaller than the sum of interaction effects between policies. For example, when an EV mandate is combined with annual registration tax and vehicle tax, we find that the overall reinforcement effects are smaller than the sum of the reinforcement effects and trade-off effects (i.e. the sum of interactions between EV mandate and fuel tax, interactions between EV mandate and vehicle tax, and the interactions between annual registration tax and vehicle tax). This is because the reinforcement effects between the EV mandates and the financial incentives fall as more financial incentives are added, due to limited effectiveness of a fixed EV mandate and the inertia of technological diffusion. Therefore, to maintain the same levels of reinforcement effects, it would be necessary to increase the stringencies of the EV mandate while adding financial policies (see Appendix G). In particular, the sizes of the overall reinforcement effects depend on the trade-off effects between policies relative to the reinforcement effects between policies.</p>
        <p>The cost-effectiveness of three policy combinations (2016 USD/tCO2).</p>
        <p>Cost Thus, when four policies are combined, the overall reinforcement effects fall further as more policies are added, although there are still reinforcement effects between the EV mandate and other policies. Hence, the overall costs of policies are higher when financial incentives are added to the policy combinations with an EV mandate.</p>
        <p>When five policies are combined, the trade-off effects between policies start to dominate. Hence, we find that there are trade-off effects between an EV mandate, the fuel tax, the vehicle tax, the fuel economy regulation, and the annual registration tax, although the trade-off effects are much smaller than the sum of the trade-off effects between any financial incentives (Table E3 of Appendix E). For this reason, according to our analysis, in a policy mix, the presence of an EV mandate is a necessary but insufficient condition for the reinforcement effects between policies.</p>
        <p>The scenario analysis in Fig. 5 illustrates the technological mixes as a result of financial incentives and fuel economy standards, and compares them with the technological mixes when EV mandates are introduced. When the EV mandates are added, as a result of the reinforcement effects, the shares for EVs increase significantly for all countries. Hence, cumulative emissions fall significantly, especially in developing countries (e.g., China and India). This suggests that the EV mandate is an essential component of any policy mix, as it multiplies the effects of all the other policies multiple times. The overall policy effectiveness of the EV mandate is the smallest in Japan because of the rapid hybrid car diffusion in the baseline scenario takes over the market. Intuitively, we observe smaller emissions reduction effects in switching from hybrid cars to EVs, than in switching from conventional petrol or diesel cars to EVs. While financial incentives encourage people to purchase low-emission vehicles, these incentives might not be sufficient for the purchase of EVs. The diversity of EVs and the availability of infrastructure deployed as a result of EV mandates have an impact on consumer preferences, especially when EV buyers are entitled to tax breaks and subsidies. If we assume that EV markets grow with their charging infrastructure, incentives that encourage the availability of EV models or EV charging stations (as we assume</p>
        <p>This research sought to promote a better understanding of the interactions between existing policies for policymakers in five major economies. We simulate scenarios for various incentive measures already implemented, and examine the interactions between policies by analyzing both trade-off and reinforcement effects between any pair of policy instruments and multiple policies. We created 63 scenarios, consisting of all possible policy combinations of the six commonly seen policies for five countries.</p>
        <p>Overall, we find that there are trade-off effects between all types of financial incentives because such incentives are charged based on the fuel economy (e.g. fuel tax) or engine size (e.g. annual registration tax). This implies that the outcomes of each policy combination are not merely additive. If consumers are incentivised to buy more energy-efficient vehicles due to one of the financial incentives, then the effectiveness of the paired incentives will be lower because the total cost (of taxation) imposed on consumers buying more efficient cars is smaller than the taxation imposed on consumers buying less efficient cars. Hence, the existence of one incentive weakens the overall financial incentives of another policy.</p>
        <p>Policymakers should consider the trade-off effects, which weaken the overall effectiveness of the policy combinations. More stringent financial incentives have to be introduced to compensate for the trade-off effects of financial incentives. Our analyses on the interactions of multiple policies reveal that the overall trade-off effects of multiple policy combinations are smaller than the sum of the trade-off effects of individual pairs and that the effectiveness improves as more financial instruments are added to the existing policy mix. However, this may prove more costly as cost-effectiveness falls when more financial incentives are added.</p>
        <p>The results suggest there might be a trade-off between policy effectiveness and costeffectiveness of adding financial incentives.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are reinforcement effects between the EV mandate and all of the other policies. Since the EV adoption rate increases with higher starting EV shares, the EV mandate magnifies the impact of the other policies. When there are more EVs available, there are more choices for consumers, which improves the effectiveness of taxes on emissions in comparison with situations presenting fewer choices.</p>
        <p>We determine that while the EV mandate is not always the most effective policy to significantly cut emissions when introduced on its own, there are substantial reinforcement effects between an EV mandate and financial incentives (e.g. fuel tax, EV subsidy, annual registration tax). Therefore, it is more cost-effective to introduce financial incentives with the EV mandate. We find that in the analyses of multiple policy combinations, the presence of an EV mandate in policy mixes substantially reduces the cost of emission reductions. However, with an EV mandate, we find that overall reinforcement effects fall as more financial policies are added to the policy mixes. This suggests that a stronger EV mandate is required when more financial incentives are introduced to mitigate the trade-off effects (see Appendix G). As the number of EVs on the road increases, it will be possible to achieve further emissions reduction as a result of the existing financial incentives.</p>
        <p>The non-linearity in a policy mix permits building policy combinations that lead to more effective outcomes than a set of policies developed independently. The appropriate number and selection of policies are dependent upon the prevailing economic conditions and the current structure of the automobile market in individual countries. Table 9 presents key findings regarding the effects of policies are introduced in isolation and in combination with other policies. Generally, we find that policy combinations achieve the highest reinforcement effect when an EV mandate is combined with fuel economy regulation. Certain car market conditions, such as the number of EVs on-road and stringencies of existing policies, are major influences on the choice of policies. Hence, in the UK and the US, we find that the reinforcement effect is the highest when an EV mandate is combined with fuel economy regulation, EV subsidies and registration taxes. In China, on the other hand, where the annual registration tax is relatively lower than in the US and the UK, the reinforcement effect is the highest when an EV mandate is combined with fuel economy regulations and fuel tax. In countries such as Japan, where current car fleets are already more fuel-efficient than other countries in this study, we find that the most effective combination emerges when fuel economy regulation is combined with EV mandates and an EV subsidy.</p>
        <p>The existence of synergistic effects contradicts basic principles of standard welfare environmental economics, which assumes that policies do not interact positively. The standard theory, which has considerable influence on present-day structuring of policies, states that the use of one instrument per externality should be used, and that more instruments would lead to inefficiencies. In our context here, this would mean observing only trade-offs. We do observe this, but only in a very limited number of cases. Due to path-dependence in transport systems, we find that the combination of policies of different natures and structures work most efficiently. For example, while a single fiscal instrument such as a tax on fuel would have to be unrealistically high to achieve emissions targets. However, in combination with other types of instruments -such as fuel economy regulations and EV mandates -such a tax could be substantially lower and produce the same outcome at a much lower cost to both public budgets and consumers</p>
        <p>General principles for road passenger transport policymaking, true for all markets, that can be inferred from this work are that one has to (1) create or enhance the availability of zero-carbon vehicles, inorder to enhance the effectiveness of other policies, and (2) tax and/or regulate out the purchase and/or use of high carbon vehicles to disincentivise their presence on roads. If either of those things is not done, the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of policies, irrespective of what they are, are much lower than they could otherwise be. (3) Layering policies (adding policies to existing policies) without careful evaluation could be ineffective and cost inefficient due to policy interactions.</p>
        <p>Following that, policymakers must choose whether they prioritise effectiveness or costeffectiveness (cost over rapidity of emissions reductions). When synergies arise, lower stringency policies can be used to achieve goals; when interference arises, higher stringency has to be used to achieve goals. This can guide the choice of policymakers for the composition of policy packages, in which financial incentives generally tend to interfere with one another, whereas financial and non-financial policies tend to synergise. Across countries, fuel economy regulation that phases out less fuel-efficient cars is the most effective policy when introduced in countries with many large, conventional cars (e.g. the US). We find that policy synergies seem to be lower in Japan, where there are a number of hybrid cars in the baseline scenario. In the FTT:Transport model, the incumbent technologies have a distinct advantage and cause technological lock-in. Achieving a significant long-term CO2 emissions objective becomes more difficult with the same policy and stringency in the presence of technological lock-in. Hence, an EV mandate is a useful policy to kick-start the diffusion of EVs in countries where the shares for EVs are low.</p>
        <p>Notably, in this study, we assume that policies are introduced simultaneously when the shares for EVs are low. Further studies should look into the timing of the policies on the overall interactions between policies. Beyond these general rules, the model must be used with tailored scenarios to explore specific policy questions. We conclude that policy interactions are a very important topic to study, and that more systematic research should be conducted on this subject.</p>
        <p>Limitations exist in the current methodology and projections. We assume that consumer demand induces the diffusion of technology in the private passenger car transport sector and that automakers are treated exogenously.</p>
        <p>In this research, we find that an EV mandate is the most cost-effective policy. This is partly because we assume that the cost of an EV mandate to consumers is the difference between the prices of EVs and conventional cars (see Appendix D.5). Over time, consumers could potentially 'gain' from EV purchases if the prices of EVs were to fall below the prices of conventional cars due to technological learning. In reality, policies such as EV mandates set annual EV credit targets instead of sales targets, as assumed in this paper. We have not taken into consideration the cost of EV mandates on the manufacturers or the government. For instance, to facilitate the implementation of EV mandates or EV subsidies, governments and manufacturers often need to invest in the construction of EV-charging infrastructure, and this has not been considered here. Hence, we acknowledge that the cost consideration for EV mandate may be simplified.</p>
        <p>As with other energy models, there are parametric uncertainties regarding the FTT:Transport model. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the effects of the parametric uncertainties on the sizes of policy interactions (see Appendix F).</p>
        <p>For the present study, an original database detailing the technological profile of cars and populations was built, as required by the methodology. The data sources for the main variables are summarised in Table A1.</p>

        <p>Transport demand is driven by income, population, urban density, family structure and other demographic factors. Studies have also found induced and rebound effects on the demand for passenger car transport. More specifically, they find that the demand for transport increases with economic and infrastructure development. For example, the enhancement of road capacity in the US and Britain positively impacts transport demand. Improvements in the infrastructure, such as highway development, generate new consumption of fossil fuels and CO 2 emissions, known as the induced effect. Improvements in energy efficiency in vehicles may lead to an increase in the service demand for PLDVs, and thus, offset the efficiency gains from technological diffusion, known as the rebound effect. Hence, it is important to consider the elasticity of demand for transport in relation to fuel price, energy efficiency, and road accessibility in the estimation and projection for the demand for PLDV services.</p>
        <p>The demand estimation in this section consists of two parts. The first part is the construction of an econometric model that predicts the demand for PLDVs (in km per vehicle) using fuel prices, income, urbanisation, road infrastructure, urban density, and fuel economy. Then we use the econometric model to predict the future private passenger vehicle transport demand (per vehicle). In the second part, we develop a model for vehicle stock and project future car ownership, which is then used to make projections for the total demand for PLDVs.</p>
        <p>The empirical model specifies kilometres per PLDV in the country i as a function of GDP per capita (Y), fuel cost in terms of oil price (FP), and a group of variables, including urbanization (U), road lengths (M), urban density (UD), and fuel economy (FE). We estimate the dynamic model because efficiency improvements and fuel price changes take time, and static models may not capture adequately the long-run adjustments of transport demand. The dynamic model we specify captures the historical trend of passenger vehicle travel demand.</p>
        <p>The interpretation for each variable is indicated in Table B1. The following section summarises the rationale for each variable in Equation B.1.</p>
        <p>Income is known to drive transport demand, and it is recognised as the main driver of transport demand growth per capita income since higher incomes allow individuals to spend more on travel. Studies have found that, while there exists a positive correlation between income and transport demand, the income elasticity for transport demand may decline as a country becomes richer [91].</p>
        <p>Since fuel prices affect fuel costs' share of the total cost of driving, we expect that a fall in fuel prices will increase the transport distance due to the rebound effect. A large number of studies have examined the elasticities of gasoline prices in transport fuel demand [92,93]. Price elasticities are almost always negative: an increase in price leads to lower demand, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Urbanization rate is defined as the share of the urban population to the total population [85].</p>
        <p>With the gradual increase in the proportion of the population living in urban areas and higher urbanisation rates, over half of all people were living in urban areas by 2012 [94]. With a higher urbanisation level and as a result of agglomeration economies, it becomes easier for people to access shops and restaurants. As urbanisation progresses, cities become more congested, making it is less convenient to use private cars. With improved public transportation and better accessibility to all aspects of urban life, the average distance travelled by cars declines [91,95].</p>
        <p>Travel distances are often shorter in cities that have greater density due to congestion and the presence of public transport networks. A number of studies have found that travel demand decreases with increased urban density. Karathodorou et al. found that there is a negative relationship between passenger car fuel consumption and urban density [64].</p>
        <p>The relationship between accessibility to destinations and the demand for transport can be measured as an induced effect. In both the UK and the US, Nolan and Lem [95] concluded that the expansion in road capacity has a positive impact on traffic demand. In the case of China, Chai et al. [96] found that when road accessibility (measured in mileage) is increased by 1%, road traffic demand increases by 1.26%.</p>
        <p>As fuel economy improves, the average fuel cost per km falls, and the demand for passenger transport increases as a result of the income effect. The rebound effect is expressed as the percentage of the forecasted reduction in energy use that is lost due to consumer and market responses [97].</p>
        <p>The results for the pooled OLS estimates are presented in Table B2. A country dummy variable is added to account for the unobserved effect. With the Breusch-Pagan test, we analyze whether it is valid to pool the data. The null hypothesis H0 for the Breusch-Pagan test is that the variance of the unobserved fixed effects is zero (i.e., it is possible to use the pooled OLS model). As the test results show, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the random effects regression is not appropriate. This implies that a pooled OLS model is superior to the randomeffects model.</p>
        <p>As Table B2 shows, the adjusted R-squared indicates that the model has strong explanatory power (R-sq=0.89). Consistent with existing studies, the results show that oil prices, urbanisation, road mileage, population density, and fuel efficiency have a significant effect on road transport demand. Income does not significantly affect the distances travelled by car per year probably because, as income increases, people purchase more vehicles instead of travelling more in each car. The coefficient results show that road accessibility has a positive effect on road transport demand, while travel demand decreases by 1.5% when the oil price increases by 10%. As countries become more urbanised, people take advantage of the public infrastructure when they are in cities. Hence, we find that distance per car falls as countries become more urbanised and that distance per car increases as more roads are built (induced demand). Fuel efficiency improvements will result in a transport increase, although the effect is small (travel demand increases by 0.3% when fuel efficiency improves by 10%).</p>
        <p>The problem with the pooled OLS model is that the outcome variable (travel demand) depends on explanatory variables, which are not observable but are correlated with the observed explanatory variables. We conduct the Hausman test to validate the suitability of the fixed effects (FE) Model. For the static models, we hypothesise that the best model is the FE model and test this with the Hausman test. Table B2 shows that fixed effects should be used since the chi-square test statistic is 35.02 and has a p-value of 0.00. Hence, we dismiss the Random Effects Model. However, only three variables are significant in explaining the variability in the transport demand. Consistent with the findings in the OLS regression, we find that oil prices and urbanisation decrease travel demand, while population density increases travel demand. The total significance of the model is not very strong, with an R 2 of 0.45. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, unlike what is observed in the OLS model, the FE model removes the non-observable fixed effects. Secondly, there is a significant trend in the time series, which can be captured only with a dynamic panel model.</p>
        <p>To account for the dynamic effect in the panel data, we use the Arellano-Bond estimator with the general method of moments (GMM), which includes the lagged dependent variable as one of the explanatory variables. For dynamic specification, the GMM estimator of Arellano and Bond, which is estimated in the first differences with instruments in levels, is required to remove the unobservable individual-specific effects. The Arellano-Bond estimator controls the fixed effects by first-differencing and assuming that the idiosyncratic error is serially uncorrelated. We carry out the regressions with the GMM in one step with robust standard errors. Table B2 shows the results for the GMM regressions. All variables are significant at either the 5% or 10% levels. Note that the signs for the coefficients of the variables in the GMM estimations are consistent with the OLS pooled estimation and the FE model. In order to validate the assumptions of the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator, we carry out the Sargan test, which yields a result of 145 with a p-value of 0.6308. Hence, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of over-identified restrictions.</p>

        <p>Car ownership models are used to forecast transport demand, energy consumption, and emission levels. Among the different model types, one of the most well-known approaches is an econometric estimation of an income-car stock model based on a logistic function [98]. Historically, GDP growth and economic development are associated with an increase in vehicle ownership. Past studies have made projections of passenger car ownership based on GDP [98][99][100].</p>
        <p>The Gompertz curve is an S-shaped growth curve that relates per capita vehicle ownership to GDP per capita. While vehicle scrappage is not explicitly included, it has been tested empirically to represent growth trend of vehicle stock [98]. We examine trends in the growth of vehicle stocks for a large sample of countries and employ the Gompertz function to estimate the relationship between the number of vehicles and per capita income.</p>
        <p>Following the previous studies, we estimate car stock with a Gompertz model:</p>
        <p>Which is equivalent to the following:</p>
        <p>where " denotes the country, , denotes the year, V i,t represents the vehicle ownership (vehicles per 1000 people) of country " in year ,, V i * is the saturation level and EF i,t is the per capita income. The parameter a determines car stock demands at zero income levels, and the [ parameter determines the shape of the S-shape curve. We find the a and b by regressing ln(ln( B4. The dashed lines in Figure B2 show the car fleet size projections between 2016 and 2050 under three GDP assumptions, namely, the SSP1, SSP3, and SSP5 assumptions (see Table B4 for details).</p>
        <p>For high-income countries, it is assumed that the GDP increases by 1.3% under SSP3 and 1.9% under SSP5 between 2020 and 2040. For the middle-income countries, it is assumed that the GDP increases by 3.9% under SSP3 and 5.2% under SSP5 between 2020 and 2040 [101]. For the US, the UK, and Japan, the difference in GDP assumptions does not affect the car fleet size projections significantly. However, in China and India, the size of the car fleet projected under SSP5 is much larger than that under SSP3, reflecting higher GDP growth projections under SSP5 compared to SSP3 for China and India.</p>
        <p>World GDP per capita projections by income group, based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) [101].</p>
        <p>The transport distance for a PLDV per year is estimated with Equation B.1, and the projections for future oil prices, urban density, urbanisation, fuel economy, road mileage, and GDP per capita are based on Arellano-Bond GMM estimation.</p>
        <p>To account for the oil price uncertainties, the travelled distance per car each year is estimated under the 10 oil price scenarios in addition to the baseline scenario. The baseline scenario oil price is taken from the projection made in the IEA New Policy Scenario [102]. Scenarios 1 to 5 assume that there is a gradual increase in oil price until the oil price is consistent with the IEA ' s current policy. Scenarios 6 to 10 assume that there is a gradual decrease in oil price until it is consistent with the IEA ' s 450 scenarios [102].</p>
        <p>The projections for car distance per year under different oil price scenarios are shown in Fig. B.1. For the US, the UK, China, and India, the car distance projected tends to decrease between 2020 and 2030 but starts to increase between 2040 and 2050. It is assumed that oil prices will increase more steeply between 2020 and 2030 compared to the period between 2040 and 2050. On the other hand, fuel economy keeps improving for all countries, although the effect is smaller for the US as a result of Trump's decision to freeze the Obama standards. Between 2020 and 2030, when the effect of the increase in oil price is stronger than the effect of fuel economy standards improvements on the car distance travelled, we find the distance travelled by cars falls. Between 2030 and 2040, when the effect of the increase in oil price on the distance travelled is smaller than the effect of fuel economy on the distance travelled, we find that the distance travelled by cars increases. Hence, the projections for car distance per year appear to be U-shaped for all countries except Japan. While the effect ofincrease in oil prices and the improvement in fuel economy standards are present in Japan, from the historical trend, car distance travelled per year has been falling since 1990, and this trend is reflected in the projections for between 2020 and 2050.</p>
        <p>The solid black line is the average distance travelled per car per year, as collected from national transportation agencies. The dashed blue lines are projections for oil prices assumed in the New Policy Scenario. The dashed black lines represent projections for the average distance travelled by car per year when oil prices increase. The dashed green lines represent the projections for travel distance per year, assuming that oil prices decease gradually (scenarios 6 to 10). As expected, the higher the oil price, the lower the average distance in all countries and vice versa. We find that as fuel economy improves, the rebound effect leads to an increase in the demand for PLDV services. The rebound effect can be mitigated by the higher oil price scenarios. the distance travelled per car as oil prices decrease (i.e., the lower the oil prices, the lighter the dashed green lines). The dashed black lines represent the distance travelled per car as oil prices increase (i.e., the higher the oil prices, the lighter the dashed black lines).</p>
        <p>We detail here the decision-making module of the FTT:Transport model. Part of this section is replicated from the Supplementary Information of Mercure et al. [9]. B.5.1 Heterogeneity in the vehicle market Consumers in vehicle markets are highly heterogeneous, and this heterogeneity varies by country. Sales for new passenger cars were obtained from MarkLines and matched to price and fuel consumption information from car manufacturers. Note that MarkLines data are comprehensive, not samples. Fig. B3 (also see [6]) shows an example of price heterogeneity in five countries, the US, UK, China, Japan, and India in 2012. For this paper, we have updated the cost distribution to 2016. We observe that the heterogeneity of vehicle markets varies widely between nations.</p>
        <p>In consumer behaviour theory, consumers are most likely to make purchases according to their own experiences with the technology or to the consumption experiences of their peers gained through social interaction [103] and visual influence (demonstrated by [63] in the US). It is also likely that the choices of consumers are influenced by their peers through the 'bandwagon effect' [33]. The cost distributions reflect the diversity of consumers in terms of choices, taste, and income. The diversity of sales in terms of cost distribution reflects the diversity of agents [6]. We postulate here that distributions of perceived costs correspond to distributions of observed costs, with a possible constant offset between them. People, we assume, when considering purchasing a vehicle, most likely choose something they have seen being purchased, perhaps by someone they know, such that they were able to gather information (i.e., they most likely do not choose something they know nothing of, and they gather reliable information predominantly through observations of their peers). Their observations of the fleet are a subset of what is on roads, and every agent observes something slightly different. This may be due to their belonging to a particular social group and social class, and they are most likely to choose amongst what their peers have previously chosen, which itself is a subset of what the whole market has to offer (e.g. poor rural households perhaps purchase different types of vehicles to rich suburban families, which itself is different than single, middle-class persons). Thus, we assume restricted technology/information access. In other words, agents do not choose what they do not know, and they do not know all of the markets. The FTT model uses a modified version of discrete choice theory in the form of an evolutionary theory. It uses observed distributions of costs to represent agent heterogeneity (a form of revealed preferences) (see [6]). Consumer decisions are modelled with chains of binary logits. In discrete choice theory [104,105], choices are made in a probabilistic fashion, which means that unobserved factors, such as taste variation and interpersonal heterogeneity, are taken into account in the discrete choice model. In the binary logit model, decision making uses pairwise comparisons of cost distributions, as shown in Fig. B4. We assume that consumers are choosing between technology ! and technology " with cost distributions # ! ( $ , $ ! )and # " ( $ , $ " ),respectively, assuming that ( ! (*) is the cumulative distribution of # " ( $ , $ ! ). The probability that a consumer chooses technology ! over technology ! depends on the instances in which the cost of technology ! falls below the cost of technology !. Hence, the fraction of agents making the choice preferring ! over ! is as follows:</p>
        <p>In the standard discrete choice model, # ! is a double exponential Gumbel distribution. Using the standard error propagation method (see SI of [9] for mathematical details), we have: [16] In the FTT:Transport model, the price distributions (e.g. Fig. B3) are segmented according to passenger car technology, and engine size used to parameterise # ! ($, $ ! ). The average and median prices, emissions, and engine sizes with their standard deviation are presented in Tables A3-A7 of Appendix A.</p>
        <p>For the decision-making component of this model, we separate the investor in transport technology from the consumer of transport services. We think of them as separate entities for clarity, even though in some cases they might be the same person. Whether the roles are fulfilled by the same actors or not, they are quite distinct, where the investor purchases a vehicle to sell a transport service to the consumer. This is done to clarify the distinction between technology investment and associated market competition, and the consumption of the service that technologies produce. It also allows for the possibility that a person who purchases a car can still travel by train or plane and not use the car he purchased. The mode choice is distinct from the technology choice, even when performed by the same person. The cost of the vehicle, as perceived by the investor purchasing a vehicle or unit of transport technology, must be taken to include all components relevant to the decision making. Many of the components are easy to quantify from available data. Others are not straightforward, and we show here how this is done. When a vehicle is purchased, an initial investment is made, or a loan is obtained, for the capital cost, and henceforth fuel and maintenance costs are: Here / # , ( # , and ?@ # are the mean capital costs (in USD), fuel cost (in USD/litre) and maintenance cost (in USD/km), respectively. 7A% # represents EV subsidies, paid to car purchasers (and therefore, negative cost) at the purchase time. (= # is the fuel tax, in USD/litre. The fuel cost depends on the fuel consumption (7 # (,) and the distance travelled each year (B"C, * ). @= # (,) is the annual registration tax, which is vehicle and class-specific, paid by car owners once per year. *( # is the capacity factor, in km/y. Several terms in Equation B.6 are distributed, while others are single-valued. Investment cost distributions can be assigned to distribution of preferences, but variations can also arise in all other parameters. The discount rate could also be distributed, but we have not included this at this stage. It is to be kept in mind however that in a root mean square calculation, any dominating parameter rapidly makes smaller contributions negligible. Here, the vehicle price distribution dominates; it has the largest standard deviation. Nevertheless, we keep energy use and maintenance parameters distributed. B.5.4. The generalised cost as a comparison measure B. 5</p>
        <p>As inferred from the price distribution of sales, transport costs are not the only factors that consumers consider when purchasing a vehicle. Many additional aspects (e.g. comfort and luxury) are valued by the consumer, of which we have little information beyond the price distribution of what is purchased. We keep in mind that technologies have different pecuniary costs, particularly across engine size classes; despite this, higher costs appear compensated by higher benefits, such that higher cost luxury vehicles maintain market shares. Were we to simulate technology diffusion based on bare LCOT distribution comparisons, the lowest LCOT technologies would diffuse more successfully, which is not consistent with our historical data. Clearly, components would be missing in the LCOT-for instance, comfort, acceleration, and style-which we may call the "intangibles". We define "intangibles" for this model as the difference between the generalized cost, which leads to observed diffusion, and the LCOT, as calculated from pecuniary vehicle properties for which we have data. The value of the intangibles, g # , is an empirical parameter obtained from making the FTT diffusion trajectory match the trajectory observed in our historical data, at the year of the start of the simulation. Adding g # to Equation B.6 produces the following:</p>
        <p>, we obtain a rate of diffusion that does not normally match historical diffusion. One, and only one, set of g # leads to the diffusion of technology in the simulation to have the same rate as the historical rate at the starting point of the simulation. The interpretation of the g # parameters is that they ensure that FTT projects in the future a diffusion trajectory (the rate of change of shares) that is the same as what is observed in historical data, and represents all costs not explicitly specified as perceived by agents.</p>
        <p>The unique set of g # cannot be obtained by simple optimization, as too many spurious local solutions arise. We, therefore, designed a dedicated graphical user interface software that enables one to robustly determine these parameters by hand (see Fig. B5). This is done for each technology in every region, making it a time-consuming procedure, but visual inspection ensures that the parameters are not spurious. We find that g # values follow what is expected: luxury models have large negative values (large benefits). Since generalized cost differences already exist in the baseline, diffusion trends exist in the baseline, a fact that is observed in the data, and the determination of the g # parameters is of primary importance. The g # values are adjusted and fed into the model to calculate the shares for all technologies for the first nine years from 2016. Note that adjusting the g # value for one technology will affect the slopes for all other technologies dynamically. Thus, we need to adjust the values for g # until the sum of the differences between the projected shares and the historical shares for all technologies is minimized. In the case that other capital costs remain unchanged, g # is independent of scenario assumptions and is a constant value, i.e., it only has to be found once. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to assess how the uncertainties in g # affect the simulations of the FTT:Transport model. Finally, it is to be noted that changing one g # value in a set for one region requires to redetermine all the others, as it changes the relative values of all technologies. Furthermore, if the definition of the LCOT is changed for any reason (e.g., adding a pecuniary parameter, or changing the discount rate), the empirical g # must all be re-determined since their meaning also changes. In this sense, the g # contain everything of relevance that is not explicitly represented in the LCOT; the more parameters are included in the LCOT, the less are implicitly represented in the g # . It takes a few hours to determine all g # values. Fig. B5. Graphical user interface used to determine g # parameters. Sliders or value inputs are used in order to change the diffusion trajectory of the model (to the right of the dashed line) until it is consistent with historical data (to the left of the dashed line).</p>
        <p>New vehicle purchases cover both replacements and increases in the total population. We assume that sales are limited by the demand, not by the supply. During a time span ∆t, out of a total j *?* (,) of new registrations in a particular region, a certain fraction of sales is allocated to different technology categories according to consumer preferences ( #! as derived above, and replacement rates, denoted by 1/' # . These parameters can be understood as determining the rate of influx and out-flux of sales shares in and out of technology categories " and ! in a set of n possibilities. Using the variable k # for the vehicle population in category ", increases in k # due to purchases being allocated into ", related to the replacement of vehicles scrapped in category ! (i.e. substitutions of " for ! at the time of scrappage), corresponds to the following: (B.8) where destructions of vehicles in ! are allocated to categories according preferences, which direct flows of units between categories. Meanwhile, the number of vehicles purchased that are not replacements are: The numbers of vehicles and vehicle destructions follow directly from the sum of the sales time series, multiplied with the survival function over all ages (numbers), or its derivative (deaths), which correspond to convolutions. The equations</p>
        <p>where N ! denotes deaths, mvehicle age, and \ ! (m)the measured survival function for technology j. In a scheme where computational power minimisation is sought, deaths can be conveniently and safely approximated with the total population divided by the life expectancy, k ! ' ! o . Thus, equations B.7 and B.8 are rewritten this way:</p>
        <p>Here, , ̅ and '̅ are the average industry growth rate and life expectancy, while the % # are technology category shares of the total fleet. For convenience, we define the matrix of time constants as s #! = , ̅ '̅ , # ' ! ⁄ . For all flow ∆k !→# of substitutions between i and j, a reverse flow ∆k #→! exists, and a net trend results:</p>
        <p>The growth of the fleet can also be expressed in a similar way:</p>
        <p>'̅ This equation expresses exchanges of market shares between technology categories " and ! according to preferences and rates of replacement. Cumulating all gains or losses to technology " at the expense or profit of all other categories, we sum over ! and obtain the replicator dynamics equation:</p>
        <p>There, the net flow of shares is regulated by the product of the matrices s #! ( #! minus its transpose. While the matrix s #! is interpreted to represent industrial dynamics and reliability, the matrix ( #! is interpreted to represent consumer choices according to our decision-making model. Thus, they are completely independent.</p>
        <p>In this section, we show briefly that including social influence or other bandwagon effects in a discrete choice model leads to the replicator dynamics equation. Note that this is shown in [20] and the SI of [9], reproduced here for reference. Discrete choice models define a linear random utility model, in which the utility _ # * (associated with purchasing a particular type of vehicle ") is expressed as a function of a number of variables V, such as income, gender, and distance travelled and so on, and regression parameters [ and u.</p>
        <p>We look for the probability that option " is chosen over other options,</p>
        <p>This leads to the multinomial logit model (MNL) (see [20] for the mathematical deviation):</p>
        <p>T ! U ∑ H ! T ; U Taking the probabilistic choice ^# as determining the shares of the market, this determines how the market evolves, in equilibrium, for changes in variables. If we assume the existence of social influence, the relative frequency of picking product "using agents is the share of the market occupied by product ". This dynamic also arises with most other types of bankdwagon effects, for example where the frequency of product availability in markets where scale of production is constrained by and grows with returns on sales and market size. Re-evaluating equation B.19 by instead multiplying on each side the probabilities calculated individually for all k agents, with k 7 , k + … , k = as the numbers of agents, we have:</p>
        <p>The solution is then:</p>
        <p>) T &gt; U Preferences ^" are instantaneous, but purchases happen at a rate ' # '7 , following consumer needs. We then take preferences as the rate of change of shares.</p>
        <p>., ! ./ = 1</p>
        <p>This is a form of replicator dynamics that can be converted to the version used in this paper (see [20]).</p>
        <p>As described in Equation 3 of Section 4.1, in the FTT:Transport, we assume that the capital costs of cars fall by a certain percentage (determined by a learning rate) every time the total quantity manufactured doubles. Tables C1-C5 show the capital costs of cars from 2020 to 2050 using the FTT:Transport model in the baseline scenario.</p>
        <p>Capital costs of cars for the UK from 2020 to 2050 using the FTT:Transport model in the baseline scenario. the total fleet number multiplied by the registration tax. In this research, we assume that the rate of the registration tax is dependent on the PLDV technologies and engine sizes.</p>

        <p>We assume that the vehicle tax is the tax levied on a vehicle at the time of vehicle acquisition. The total cost of vehicle tax for consumers in a country each year is equal to the number of new car sales multiplied by the corresponding vehicle tax. In this research, we assume that the rate of vehicle tax is dependent on PLDV technologies and engine sizes.</p>

        <p>We assume that fuel tax is paid by consumers based on the car's fuel consumption. Hence, the cost of the fuel tax to each consumer is calculated by multiplying the distance travelled by each consumer, the average fuel consumption factor PLDV and the levels of fuel tax in each country. Following Table B2, we assume that distance travelled falls when fuel tax increases the cost of fuel for consumers. The total cost of fuel tax to consumers in a country is the product of the total fleet number in a country and the cost of the fuel tax for each PLDV. We assume that EV subsidies are paid directly by the government to the new EV purchasers. In reality, the levels of EV subsidies depend on a number of factors, including battery sizes (e.g., China) or as income credits to car buyers (e.g. US). For modelling purposes, we assumed that the levels of EV subsidies increase with prices of EVs.</p>
        <p>=Q,m\%R2 = l %R2 #,* * 7A #,* N, +%6% +%7V where =Q,m\%R2 is the total EV subsidies paid by the government between 2018 and 2050. %R2 #,* is the subsidies (in USD per unit) paid by the government to EV car owners. 7A #,* is the number of new EVs of size " at time ,.</p>
        <p>We assume that the costs for the EV mandates are paid by car manufacturers or the consumers. We assume that the total costs of the EV mandates equal the difference in the prices of EVs and of conventional cars, multiplied by the number of new EV sales as a result of the EV mandates. For example, if the EV mandate requires 10% of new car sales to be EVs in 2020, then the total cost of the EV mandate programme is the difference between the average price of EV and of conventional cars multiplied by the 10% of new car sales.</p>
        <p>=Q,m\Z% = l (7A*QC, * -sJ}*QC, * ) * kH|7A * N, +%6% +%7V =Q,m\Z% is the cost of the EV mandate programme to the manufacturer or to the consumers between 2018 and 2050. We assume the cost is equal to the difference between the price of EV (7A*QC, * ) and the price of an average petrol car (sJ}*QC, * ) multiplied by the number of new EV sales (kH|7A * ) under the EV mandate programme.</p>
        <p>We assume that the cost of EV mandate to the consumers is the difference between the prices of EVs and of conventional cars. This implies that consumers could potentially 'gain' from EV purchases if the prices of EVs were to fall below the prices of conventional cars. We have not taken into consideration the cost of the EV mandate on manufacturers and the government. For instance, to facilitate the implementation of the EV mandate or EV subsidies, governments and manufacturers often need to invest in the construction of EV charging infrastructure, and this has not been considered.</p>
        <p>While fuel economy standards have the benefit of reducing fuel consumption for consumers, fuel economy standards have imposed costs on car manufacturers and consumers. In this study, we assume that the costs of fuel economy standards ((7IQC,), which are 3% of the gross car sales, are partly absorbed by car manufacturers, with fuel savings enjoyed by the consumers.

        <p>In this section, we carry out a sensitivity analysis over most relevant technological parameters of FTT:Transport, including the discount rate, the learning rate, the γ factor (or the "intangible"), and fuel prices. These parameters were chosen because they would generate the most changes in emissions and technological shares. The parameters varied here are as follows:</p>
        <p>1. Learning rates for EVs (not varied for conventional petrol and diesel cars because the learning for mature technologies is insignificant). 2. Consumer discount rates. 3. The price of electric vehicles. 4. γi values for all vehicle types. 5. Fuel prices. The variation used is between 5% and 20%, depending on the parameters (see Table F1). The uncertainty range was chosen based on existing literature for the discount rate, learning rate or variations that we consider as reasonable, such as the γi values). Learning rate variations were considered based on [75,106]. We assume a low EV learning rate scenario (5%) and a high EV learning rate (15%) scenario. Following [73], we test a low discount rate scenario (5%) and a high consumer discount rate scenario (25%). The intangibles (g values) are derived from the historical trends of technological diffusion. However, the fitting of g are only accurate to a certain extent, which we estimate between 5% and 20%, depending on the availability of historical data. For instance, EVs have less historical data than petrol cars. In the sensitivity analysis, we vary the g values by 10% for every car technology in order to explore the effect of uncertainties in g values on the final projections. In principle, g values are constants derived from historical data; we do not expect large uncertainties with the g values. Varying the g values too much (i.e., above 10%) would violate the model. For example, if we vary the g values by 30%, then we will find that the diffusion trajectory is no longer consistent (see Appendix B.5.4.1 for more details). The fluctuations of oil prices have a significant effect on the efficiency of cars purchased by consumers and the distance travelled by cars over time. In the FTT:Transport model, oil prices affect total emissions through the demand equations and through consumer choice over car technologies. We have assumed four oil price scenarios: a very low oil price scenario (50% lower than the 2016 oil price level), a low oil price scenario (20% lower than the current oil price projections), a high oil price scenario (20% higher than the current oil price scenario) and a very high oil price scenario (50% higher than the current oil price scenario). Note that it is possible for the oil prices to be higher or lower than 50% of the current oil price projections. The aim of this analysis is to study the effect of a fluctuation in oil prices on the model projections.</p>
        <p>It is important to analyse model responses to variations in key parameters to ensure the model is not 'highly sensitive' to very specific values for any particular parameter. As a benchmark, we adopt the definition that a change of X% of CO2 emissions that results from a parameter variation of Y% is 'small' if X is five times smaller Y and 'large' if X is of the order of Y. This is a reasonable definition because if X% change is larger than Y% parameter variation, then we may see a large propagating uncertainty. However, if X% is much smaller than Y%, then the output uncertainty is much smaller than the input uncertainty for each parameter. We conclude this analysis with the following broad findings. Learning rates, EV prices, and discount rates tend to have a small impact on the results (i.e., less than 1% changes in emissions as a result of 5% variation in learning rates and 10% variation in EV prices and discount rates for most countries. The effects of the learning rates on the scenario analysis are the largest in the countries with the highest market shares of EV, such as China, where a 2% decrease in CO2 emissions is the result of a 5% variation (higher) in the learning rates parameter in the baseline scenario. The effect is negligible in the baseline scenario in the countries where there are very few EVs on-road (i.e., India) and where we find that there is no change in emissions as a result of 5% variation in the learning rates parameter in the baseline scenario. For all countries, we find that there is less than 4% change in CO2 emissions as a result of 20% variation in the g value in the baseline scenario. As we have expected, changes in g for one technology mostly affects its own pace of diffusion. Hence, we find that changes in g values have almost no impact on the emissions projections when the shares for EVs are under 1%. Overall, the relatively low impact of varying the g parameters is explained by the fact that the model is not sensitive to small changes in pecuniary cost for individual technologies. Since the model has some degree of momentum and inertia in its diffusion trajectories, changes in the costs data create a change in the trajectory but not an instantaneous change in the shares.</p>
        <p>In this section, we examine the impact of parametric uncertainties on the interactions between policies. The parameters are varied by quantities that we considered in the baseline scenario (see Appendix F.1). We conduct the sensitivity analysis for all 63 scenarios (all possible interactions), each with eight parametric variations. Tables F2-F5 present the percentage change in the size of interactions as a result of variations in key parameters that generate the most changes in emissions and technological shares. Changing EV learning rates have a small impact on the interactions, in particular for countries with a small number of EV (e.g. the UK and India). On the other hand, variations in oil prices have a bigger impact on the interactions between policies. Overall, we find that the percentage change in the sizes of interactions as a result of variations in parameters does not increase with the number of policy interactions. Changes in the size of the interaction effects, as a result of the variation in parameter, are within 30% for all scenarios. This implies that there is no 'directional change' 8 in the interactions as a result of the parametric uncertainties. Hence, we argue that the parametric uncertainties will not change the main conclusions of this paper. 8 Directional change refers to a change in direction for the interaction effects (e.g. from trade-off effects to reinforcement effects), when the percentage change in the interactions between policies is larger than 100%.</p>

        <p>In this research, we assume that 10% of new car sales are EV, consistent with the level China proposed in 2019. In reality, to accelerate the rate of EV deployment, many car markets around the world (e.g., California, China, and the EU) have announced aggressive electrification goals, targeting high electric share in a 2020-2050 timeframe [107]. For example, the EU Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate targets 15% of EV market shares by 2025 and 35% by 2030. Therefore, in this section, under the 'High EV mandate scenario', we assume that 35% of new car sales are EV by 2030, and by 2040, and 70% of new car sales are EV by 2040 in all five countries: the UK, the US, Japan, China, and India (see assumptions in Table G1).</p>
        <p>Table G2 shows the effectiveness of a 'high EV mandate' on reducing cumulative CO2 emissions in the five countries, in comparison to the less ambitious 'EV mandate scenario' assumed in this paper (see scenario assumptions in Table 1 of Section 6). Note that the 'additional effectiveness' of a more stringent EV mandate is relatively small in China because the shares for electric cars are the highest in China before the imposition of a more ambitious target.</p>
        <p>The goal of the analysis is to examine how a higher (or more ambitious) EV mandate affects the levels of trade-off and reinforcement effects. Table G3 shows the interactions between the financial incentives, the EV mandate assumed in Table 1 (Section 6), and the 'high EV mandate' (Table G1). The reinforcement effects between the 'high EV mandate' and other policies are slightly larger than the reinforcement effects between a less ambitious 'EV mandate scenario' and other policies. This implies that reinforcement effects between financial incentives and the EV mandate can be increased by setting a more ambitious EV mandate.</p>
        <p>The interaction effect between five policies. When the interaction effect is positive, there is a reinforcement effect between the five policies. EVM(L) indicates a less ambitious EV mandate (see assumptions in Table 1 of Section 6), and EVM(H) indicates a 'high EV mandate scenario' (see assumption in Table G2).
