        <p>Role of ZrO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; and CeO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; support on the In&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt;O&lt;inf&gt;3&lt;/inf&gt; catalyst activity for CO&lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; hydrogenation. Fuel, 331.</p>
        <p>The excessive use of fossil fuels increases the emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere which contributes to global warming. [1,2] A combined process of CO 2 capture, storage and utilization is an important way to mitigate the surplus CO 2 and dependency on fossil fuels. [3,4] Thus, production of chemical feedstocks and transportation fuels from the utilization of CO 2 has attracted great attention recently. [5] Methanol is an important chemical feedstock which is used in various applications and can be further converted into other important chemicals such as chloromethane, methyl tert-butyl ether, formaldehyde, acetic acid, and fuels. [6,7] Methanol can be synthesized from various reactions where CO 2 hydrogenation is an environmentally important chemical reaction. It usually occurs with the following system of competing and series reactions as shown in Scheme 1.</p>
        <p>CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 and CO hydrogenation are exothermic (Eq.1 and 2), whereas Eq. 3, the competitive reverse-water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS), is endothermic during the CO 2 hydrogenation. [6] Additionally, the conversion of methanol into hydrocarbons is also an attractive solution to provide alternative sustainable energy resources. [7] Over the decades, Cu/ZnO/Al 2 O 3 and Cu-ZnO catalysts have been used and studied for the synthesis of CH 3 OH from syngas at industrial and laboratory scales, respectively. Similarly, a wide variety of heterogeneous catalysts are developed for the synthesis of CH 3 OH from CO 2 hydrogenation [7] where transition metal catalysts like Cu, Pd, Ag, and Pt are used. [8] Recently, oxide-based catalysts like In 2 O 3 , [9,10] metal promoted In 2 O 3 , [11,12] and ZnO-ZrO 2 [13] have been reported to have excellent activity for methanol synthesis (Table S1, See supporting information). [14][15][16] The oxide-based catalysts have different active sites than traditional metal catalysts with different reaction mechanisms. [17] Martin et al. synthesized ZrO 2 supported In 2 O 3 which rendered 100 % selectivity for CH 3 OH synthesis and was found to be stable up to 1000 h on stream whereas the reference Cu-ZnO-Al 2 O 3 catalyst lost 44 % of its activity in 100 h. [18] Recently, In x /ZrO 2 (x = 0.1-5 wt%) catalysts were screened for CH 3 OH synthesis under industrially relevant conditions and a highly tunable selectivity for CH 3 OH from CO 2 hydrogenation was observed. [19] Loadings of 2.5-5 wt% In on catalysts have shown 70-80 % CH 3 OH selectivity whereas 0.1 wt% loading of In exhibited a CO selectivity up to 80 %. In addition, the distribution of products was found to depend on the interfacial structure of ZrO 2 and In 2 O 3 . A composition of Cu-In-Zr-O was reported to act as a bifunctional catalyst, where In 2 O 3 adsorbs CO 2 and the Cu-sites adsorb, and provide active hydrogen to adjacently adsorbed CO 2 . [20] Generally, high pressure and low temperature favor the synthesis of CH 3 OH. However, a high reaction temperature aids CO 2 activation whereas a lower temperature is thermodynamically favorable for CH 3 OH formation and this condition creates a kinetic limitation for the reaction. [21] At the reaction condition, other competing reactions occur in parallel in addition to the RWGS that can produce many side products like methane, formaldehyde, and formic acid. [22][23][24][25] The support materials play a significant role in heterogeneous catalysis. [8] In an interesting study by Hartadi et al., the authors have discussed the importance of support materials like Al 2 O 3 , ZnO, ZrO 2 , and TiO 2 for CO 2 hydrogenation. [26] Due to the versatile properties and weak hydrophilic character of ZrO 2 , over the past decades, substantial progress has been made over ZrO 2 -supported catalysts. [27][28][29][30] It has been stated that ZrO 2 supports interact with metals and oxide-based catalysts and change various reaction parameters and environments which increased the activity of the catalysts. [31] Perez-Ramirez et al. studied the role of ZrO 2 as a support for In 2 O 3 in CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol and suggested that the ZrO 2 support used its own oxygen vacancies to activate the CO 2 . [32] The study was mainly focused on ZrO 2 whereas other supports like Al 2 O 3 and CeO 2 were used for a comparison study. Gong et al. described the strong electronic interaction between In 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 which was responsible for high selectivity towards methanol. [25] Previously, the promotional effect of CeO 2 on Ga 2 O 3 was studied experimentally for the RWGS and it was observed that the CeO 2 increased the oxygen vacancies which increased the dissociation of absorbed H 2 to react with absorbed CO 2 and increase coverages of bicarbonate species. [33] Moreover, ceria can enhance the oxygen storage and release in oxidizing and reducing conditions, respectively. [34][35][36] In another study, In 2 O 3 /CeO 2 was studied for the RWGS and maximum CO 2 conversion of 20 % was reported when In 2 O 3 and CeO 2 were mixed in a 1:1 weight ratio at 773 K. [37] However, this study has not discussed the formation of methanol over In 2 O 3 /CeO 2 catalysts. Thus, most studies have focused on CO formation over CeO 2 supported catalysts.</p>
        <p>Although studies reported the positive effect of ZrO 2 as a support for methanol synthesis, [31] less attention has been paid to CeO 2 as a support which is also capable of promoting the formation of oxygen vacancies for CO 2 activation. Therefore, these studies intrigued us to explore more about CeO 2 as a support for CO 2 hydrogenation into methanol along with ZrO 2 . Thus, a comparative study was carried out between In x /ZrO 2 and In x /CeO 2 to identify the influence of the catalyst support on catalyst activity, deactivation, and stability during CO 2 hydrogenation to methanol while having comparable quantities of oxygen vacancies, In 2 O 3 loadings and surface areas. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report where deactivation and regeneration studies of CeO 2 -supported In 2 O 3 were explored, which is the objective of the current study.</p>
        <p>In(NO 3 ) 3 ⋅xH 2 O salt was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Supporting materials ZrO 2 (monoclinic phase, extrudates, SZ 31164, NORPRO), and CeO 2 powder (99.5 H.S.A 514, Rhône-Polenc, La Rochelle, France) were used. For activity tests in the reactor, the catalyst powders were pelletized into 250-500 µm particles using a hydraulic press after impregnation of indium oxide (In 2 O 3 ) on zirconia (ZrO 2 ) and ceria (CeO 2 ).</p>
        <p>The catalysts (In x /ZrO 2 &amp; In x /CeO 2 , x = 1 and 13 wt% In loading) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using CeO 2 and ZrO as supports for In 2 O 3 loading (Figure S1). For that, the In(NO 3 ) 3 ⋅xH 2 O salt was dissolved in a mixture of ethanol and MilliQ water and dropwise added directly to the powder support to form a slurry. Further, the slurry was dried at 373 K and then the powder was calcined at 573 K in a furnace for 3 h. A similar procedure was used for the preparation of In x / CeO 2 . Note that to determine the role of the supports, unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 was prepared using a calcination process where the Indium salt was calcined at 573 K in the furnace for 3 h. Further, catalytic CO hydrogenation was conducted in a continuous reactor setup. Prior to the reaction, a thermal treatment was done in which the catalyst was heated in pure Ar (30 mL min -1 ) at 573 K and 0.5 MPa for 1 h.</p>
        <p>To determine the crystalline nature of the catalysts, powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in a SIEMENS diffractometer D5000 using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a tube current and voltage of 40 mA and 45 kV, respectively. Diffraction patterns were collected with 2θ ranging from 20 • to 70 • using a step size of 0.02.</p>
        <p>In-situ FTIR spectroscopy experiments were performed in diffusive reflectance (DRIFT) mode with a BRUKER Vertex 70 spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled MCT detector and a high-temperature stainless steel reaction cell (Harrick Praying Mantis™) with KBr windows. To measure the temperature of the sample, a K-type thermocouple was fitted into the sample holder and controlled by a PID regulator (Eurotherm). The total flow of gases into the reaction cell was fixed at 100 ml min -1 in all experiments by feeding the gases via individual mass flow controllers. Spectra were recorded by accumulating 265 scans in the range of 4000-600 cm -1 with a resolution of 4 cm -1 for the temperature range of 493-553 K at atmospheric pressure. Time-resolved spectra were recorded every 60 s to obtain phase-resolved spectra.</p>
        <p>The specific surface area of the catalysts was determined by nitrogen sorption at 77 K (Micromeritics Tristar 3000) using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The samples were dried in N flow at 500 K for 3 h prior to the measurements.</p>
        <p>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Physical Electronics (PHI) 5000 VersaProbe III Scanning XPS Microprobe featuring focused monochromatic Al-Kα radiation with the X-ray (E = 1486.6 eV) beam size around 100 µm. The X-ray was generated via the electron beam bombardment onto the Al anode which was operating at 15 kV and 25 W. A hemispherical capacitor electron-energy analyzer was used equipped with a 32-channel plate and a position-sensitive detector. The samples were adhered onto double-sided tapes, fastened to the sample plate, and then introduced into the spectrometer after a Scheme 1. Possible reactions for the synthesis of methanol.</p>
        <p>prolonged pre-pumping process in the introduction chamber. Due to the poor-conducting/insulating nature of the powder samples, charge compensation was conducted under the operation of both the electron neutralizer and ion gun. The measurements were run under a UHV environment around 1.0-3.0 ×10 -6 Pa. The take-off angle of the emitted photoelectron is 45 • and the analyzer was operated in the constant pass energy mode (Survey: 280 eV; Regional/Narrow scan: 26 eV).</p>
        <p>X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was carried out using a WDXRF (Wavelength Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence) spectrometer equipped with a Rh source operated at 60 kV and 125 mA.</p>
        <p>TEM measurements were performed on a Titan 80-300 system (FEI Company) operated at 300 kV. The sample was crushed between two glass slides and distributed over a perforated carbon Cu grid to prepare the sample for TEM analysis.</p>
        <p>CO 2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO 2 -TPD) and H 2 temperature-programmed reduction (H 2 -TPR) were studied using a digital scanning calorimeter (Sensys DSC, Setaram) coupled with a mass spectrometer (HPR-20 QUI, Hiden). For CO 2 -TPD, 50 mg of powder catalyst was loaded into a microreactor and then pretreated with Ar at 573 K for 30 min. Thereafter, the microreactor was cooled to 313 K and exposed to a flow of 5000 ppm CO 2 /Ar for 90 min. Further, the catalyst was purged with Ar for 60 min. Then, the CO 2 desorption behavior was studied in Ar by increasing the temperature from 313 K to 973 K with a ramp rate of 10 K/min. The concentration of CO 2 was monitored using the mass number of m/z = 44. For H 2 -TPR measurements, the catalyst (30 mg) was pretreated in Ar at 573 K for 30 min and then cooled to 298 K. The H 2 flow (20 NmL/min, 1 vol% H 2 /Ar) was introduced at 298 K for 20 min and then the temperature was ramped up to 1073 K (10 K/min) and maintained for 30 min at this temperature. The concentration of H 2 was monitored using the mass number of m/z = 2.</p>
        <p>The CO 2 hydrogenation reaction was evaluated in a continuous highpressure fixed bed vertically positioned tubular stainless-steel reactor (0.85 cm diameter and 21.45 cm length) supplied by Vinci Technologies, France. The reactor was loaded with 0.5 g of catalyst sample. Reaction conditions were as follows: H 2 /CO 2 = 3 (molar ratio), GHSV = 12000 h -1 , T = 493-573 K and P=3.0 MPa. The packing of the reactor consisted first of a bottom layer of 10.3 cm of pure SiC, above which was placed a layer of pure catalyst of (ca. 0.7 cm), which was placed between two thin layers of quartz wool. Finally, the remaining upstream part of the reactor (ca. 10.5 cm) was filled with SiC. A thermocouple was positioned in the reactor with its tip in contact with the catalyst sample for measuring the actual catalyst temperature during the reaction. Prior to the reaction, the catalysts were pre-treated with pure Ar (30 NmL min -1 ) at 573 K for 1 h under 0.5 MPa pressure. After that, the catalysts were cooled down to reaction temperature in pure Ar, and then the reactant gases (CO 2 and H 2 with a molar ratio of 1:3) were introduced into the reactor at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 12000 h -1 and the pressure was raised to 3.0 MPa. Catalytic activity was measured at temperatures ranging from 493 to 573 K. The Ar flow was resumed after each day of measurements and maintained overnight. The catalyst bed remained in a temperature range from the desired reaction temperature to room temperature. Measurements were recorded when the reaction reached a steady state. The concentrations of the gaseous products in the outlet streams were measured by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, SCION 456) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID), and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TCD detector was connected to an HS-Q column whereas the FID was connected to a mild-polar aluminum oxide packed column (Agilent Technologies, Inc., HP-Al/S, 30*0.53 mm, 15 µm) for product separation.</p>
        <p>The CO 2 conversion (X CO2 ), selectivities for CH 3 OH (S CH3OH ), CO (S CO ), and CH 4 (S CH4 ) , and space-time-yield (STY) were calculated according to the following equations:</p>
        <p>where F i is the molar flow rate of component i, M is the molar mass of methanol and W is the weight of the catalyst sample.</p>
        <p>Table 1 shows the In contents of four catalysts from XRF measurements. The In loadings were close to the targeted values of 1 and 13 wt %. A similar loading of In for each pair of catalysts using different supports ZrO 2 and CeO 2 allows for comparing the properties and the activity of the samples.</p>
        <p>The crystallinity of CeO 2 and ZrO 2 -supported In 2 O 3 catalysts were studied using XRD analysis (Figure 1). The patterns of the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 showed four main reflections at 2θ = 30.5 • , 35.4 • , 50.9 • and 60.5 • , which are assigned to the diffractions from the (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (4 4 0) and (6 2 2) planes. The XRD patterns of the freshly prepared In 13 /ZrO 2 showed the characteristic diffractions of cubic In 2 O 3 and monoclinic ZrO 2 . [38] It should be noted that a small shift in the diffraction peaks corresponding to In 2 O 3 was observed, for example, the reflection of (2 2 2) was shifted from 30.5 • to 30.9 • (Figure S2a). These results suggest some changes in the coordination of In-O-In (Figure 2a). It has been reported that the ZrO 2 support helps to make In 2 O 3 electronically rich which is favourable for methanol formation. [39] Previous studies have discussed such interactions between the support and catalyst. [25,32] In the pattern of In 13 /CeO 2 , the diffraction peaks of the CeO 2 support were observed at 2θ = 28.6 • , 33.1 • , 47.5 • and 56.3 • , which corresponds to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0) and (3 1 1) planes of CeO 2 . [40] However, it should be noted that the intensity of the diffractions of In 2 O 3 is low for the In 13 /CeO 2 sample, making the interpretation difficult. This is likely due to that the In 2 O 3 is well dispersed and does not form large In 2 O 3 crystallites. These results are supported by the STEM images, where the particles were not as clear as for the In 13 / ZrO 2 sample. This will be further discussed in connection to Figure 3. The peaks of In 2 O 3 on ZrO 2 support, on the other hand, are significantly stronger, suggesting larger crystallinity of In 2 O 3 on the ZrO 2 support than on the CeO 2 support. The crystallite size of the bulk In 2 O 3 was 19.5 nm for the (222) plane (2θ = 30.5 • ), whereas it was only 9.1 nm for In 13 / ZrO 2 . The crystallite size of In 2 O 3 on CeO 2 , was not possible to determine with accuracy because the diffraction peak was so small. The results are in line with earlier reported studies where the size of In 2 O 3 particles decreased after impregnation on CeO 2 and ZrO 2 . [37] XRD patterns with negligible In 2 O 3 peak intensities were found with 1 wt% loading of In on both supports (Figure S3).</p>
        <p>The diffraction patterns of SiC were observed in the XRD in the case of the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 catalyst since it was used as a filler while packing the reactor. [41,42] There was no change in the diffraction of In 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 for the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 which indicates no change in the crystalline structure of the catalyst after the reaction. However, small intensity peaks of In metal (2θ = 36.7 • , 39.1 • , 54.4 • , PDF#04-010-6206) were observed which was also detected in the XPS analysis of the spent In 13 / ZrO 2 catalysts. [43] The porosity of In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 was measured using N 2 physisorption and the data is summarized in Table 1. The surface areas of In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 were found to be 60.0 m 2 /g and 66.6 m 2 /g, respectively, whereas the surface area of the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 catalyst was only about 5 m 2 /g. The surface area and pore volume increased when the In loading was decreased from 13 % to 1 % over ZrO 2 and CeO 2 (Table 1 and Figure 2 and Figure S4). The pore volume of the ZrO 2 -supported catalysts was found to be larger than that of CeO 2supported catalysts while the opposite was true for surface areas. It was observed that the surface area and pore volume decreased after loading of In on both supports. The results indicate that the loading of In 2 O 3 blocks some of the pores of the support. It is also noted that the average pore width was larger for ZrO 2 than for the CeO 2 support. A larger pore size of ZrO 2 than CeO 2 could explain the larger crystallite size of In 13 / ZrO 2 than In 13 /CeO 2 .</p>
        <p>Type IVa N 2 -Isotherms were observed for all catalysts (Figure 2) , which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. [44] The CeO 2 -supported In 2 O 3 catalysts show a hysteresis loop of type H1 which is associated with porous materials exhibiting a narrow distribution of relatively uniform pores while a type H3 loop was observed for ZrO 2supported In 2 O 3 catalysts [44]. The surface area and In contents of all the supported catalysts are similar which is favorable to compare their catalytic performance. Only the bulk In 2 O 3 sample had a far lower surface area and pore volume.</p>
        <p>The surface area of spent In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 were also measured, and it was found that the surface area of In 13 /CeO 2 was reduced from 66.6 to 48.0 m 2 /g, whereas no change was observed in the surface area of In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure 2b) . The pore volumes decreased of both spent In 13 /ZrO 2 (from 0.21 to 0.17 cm 3 /g) and In 13 /CeO 2 (from 0.13 to 0.11 cm 3 /g) which indicates blockage of pores.</p>
        <p>TEM imaging of In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 are shown in Figure 3. It demonstrates that the crystalline In 2 O 3 particles are well distributed on the surface of the crystalline ZrO 2 (Figure 3a). While on the CeO 2 support, In 2 O 3 particles might be embedded between CeO 2 layers that cover the crystalline planes of In 2 O 3 . Thus, the crystalline planes for In 2 O 3 were difficult to distinguish. These results are consistent with the XRD patterns where the diffraction of indium was very weak (Figure 1b). The uniform distribution of In 2 O 3 over CeO 2 and ZrO 2 was observed in EDX mapping of both catalysts (Figure S5)</p>
        <p>To examine the chemical state of the elements, XPS analyses of In 2 O 3 , In 13 /ZrO 2 , and In 13 /CeO 2 were carried out (Figure 4-5, Figure S6). Before each analysis, all samples were ex situ pretreated in Ar at 573 K for 1 h. The O 1s core level of the unsupported In 2 O 3 catalyst was deconvoluted into three peaks at 531.7, 530.9 and 529.2 eV which were assigned to surface OH, defect (vacancy), and lattice (In-O-In), respectively (Figure 4a). [45] For the supported catalyst, it is more complicated to make the deconvolution because each component of the core O 1s is also contributed by the support. Moreover, the interaction between In 2 O 3 and the support can cause a change in the electron density around O, which possibly makes a shift in the position of the peaks. In 13 /ZrO 2 revealed three pronounced O 1s peaks at 533.0, 531.0, and 529.7.0 eV (Figure 4a). The peaks at about 529.7 and 533.0 eV correspond to O lattice and OH, respectively, while that at 531.0 eV is related to the oxygen defects. [46] In the case of the In 13 /CeO 2 catalyst, four peaks of O 1s at 528.8, 530.2, 531.3, and 533.0 eV are assigned to the binding energies of Ce 4+ -O, oxygen defects (Ce 3+ -O), In-O-In and OH, respectively (Figure 4b).</p>
        <p>It is seemingly difficult to identify the contribution of support material in the total amount of oxygen defects as peaks are overlapped after deconvolution. To better understand the contribution of the support, the core level of Zr 3d and Ce 3d were deconvoluted and the data are summarized in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, the Zr 3d core level was deconvoluted into three doublets at 181.8 , 183.3 , and 185.2 eV. The binding energies at 181.8 and 183.3 eV were assigned to ZrO 2 and Zr (OH) 4 , respectively [47], while the higher binding energy at 185.2 eV could be from changed forms of ZrO 2 due to synergic interaction with In 2 O 3 (In-O-Zr, Figure 5a). [25,48,49] The spectrum of Ce 3d core level was deconvoluted into two series of bands u and v, corresponding to the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 spin-orbits, respectively (Figure 5b). The group of six peaks denoted as v, v2, v3, u, u2, and u3 was assigned for the oxidation state of +4 (Ce 4+ ) whereas the group of four peaks labeled as v0, v1, u0, and u1 was characteristic of the oxidation state of +3 (Ce 3+ ). [50] The oxidation state of +4 (Ce 4+ ) is dominant (82 %) in the In 13 /CeO 2 .[51, 52 53] Figure 4b shows the binding energy of In3d core levels of In 2 O 3 , In 13 / ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 catalysts. Two peaks located at 443.6 and 451.3 eV were observed in the XPS spectra for the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 , which can be attributed to the characteristic spin-orbit splits 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of In 3d core level. [48,49] Both peaks are associated with indium as the catalyst was prepared by thermal composition and was unsupported. The binding energy of 3d5/2 at 443.7 eV is rarely reported in the literature for oxide forms of indium. Instead, the peak at 443.7 eV and 444.8 eV have been usually reported for In 0 and In 3+ , respectively. [54] Therefore, the unusual characteristics of the 3d5/2 binding energy of the unsupported In 2 O 3 catalyst could be related to the nature of the material prepared by the decomposition of In(NO 3 ) 3 precursor. It can be noted that metallic In was not detected by the XRD analysis (Figure 1). The metallic indium could either have been formed during heating of the salt in the preparation, and/or possibly by reduction of the surface under the ultra-high vacuum environment of the XPS instrument. In addition, XPS is a surface analysis technique, whereas XRD measures bulk properties. So metallic In is apparently only present on the surface of the materials. For the supported catalysts, the In 3d spectrum was deconvoluted into three doublets assigning to metallic In, In 2 O 3 , and In(OH) 3 (Figure 4b). The percentage of surface In 2 O 3 was slightly higher on In 13 /ZrO 2 (36.2 %) than In 13 /CeO 2 (31.1 %) . A core level of 3d5/2 of In3d was observed in both supported catalysts at 446.0 eV for In 13 /CeO 2 and 446.7 eV for In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure 4b) , which are due to In(OH) 3. [55] This peak was higher in the case of In 13 /ZrO 2 (53.3 %) than In 13 /CeO 2 (41.3 %) . These results indicate that the amount of In(OH) 3 is higher over fresh In 13 / ZrO 2 than In 13 /CeO 2 which is also the same trend as the percentage of the OH fraction from the O 1s core level data. The metallic species of In with the binding energy of 3d5/2 at 443.7 eV were also observed in both supported catalysts and their percentage were 27.5 % and 10.5 % over In 13 /CeO 2 and In 13 /ZrO 2 , respectively .</p>
        <p>Deconvolutions of the XPS spectra of spent catalysts were carried out to interpret the changes in the chemical state of In and supports after the reaction (Figure S6 and Table 2). For that, the spent catalysts were flushed with Ar during the cooling down of the catalyst bed after the reaction and thereafter exposed to air at room temperature before the XPS measurements. XPS analysis showed 31 % oxygen vacancies over fresh In 13 /ZrO 2 whereas it was 34 % over In 13 /CeO 2 . Further, the percentage of oxygen vacancies increased from 34 to 39 % over the spent In 13 /CeO 2 while it dropped from 31 to 19 % in the case of In 13 /ZrO 2. The chemical state and amount of metal hydroxide were also examined in spent and fresh catalysts, and it was found that the amount over ZrO also increased from 60 to 90 % in the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure 5a). A smaller peak, with a binding energy of around 179 eV was also observed in the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure 5a), which could be associated with Zr 3d5/2 for metallic Zr . [47] The amount of Ce 3+ ion increased from 18 to 45 % in the spent In 13 /CeO 2 (Figure 5b). This result indicates that the CeO 2 support creates more oxygen vacancies in an H 2 environment. Moreover, the percentage of In(OH) 3 (determined from the In3d core level) was reduced from 41.3 to 30.8 % over the spent In 13 /CeO whereas it became zero from 53.3 % over the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure S6, Table 2) . We also observed a change in the ratio of In 0 /In 2 O 3 after the reaction. It increased from 0.29 to 0.65 for the In 13 /ZrO 2 whereas it decreased from 0.88 to 0.34 for the In 13 /CeO 2 . The data suggest that during the reaction, the oxidation states changed not only for the active phase (In 0 /In 2 O 3 ) but also for the supports.</p>
        <p>In-situ DRIFT spectroscopy was conducted to study the adsorption behavior of CO 2 and identify the adsorbed species during the interaction of CO 2 with H 2 over In 13 /ZrO 2 , and In 13 /CeO 2 (Figures 67). Prior to each experiment, the catalysts were pre-treated at 573 K in Ar for 1 h. After pretreatment, the catalyst was cooled down in Ar to the desired temperature where the background spectrum was collected at 493 K. The catalyst was thereafter exposed to a steady gas flow of 0.03 vol.% CO 2 in Ar at 493 K and the adsorption behavior of CO 2 for In 13 /CeO 2 and In 13 /ZrO 2 catalysts are shown in Figure 6. Bands related to ionic bicarbonate (i-HCO - 3 ) [56] as well as bridged bicarbonate (b-HCO - 3 ) [56] were observed on the surface of In 13 /ZrO 2 . The bands related to b-HCO - 3 appeared at 1620 and 1225 cm -1 while for i-HCO - 3 the bands were found at 1695 and 1435 cm -1 (Figure 6a). [57] Bands related to carbonates were also observed at 1585, 1555 and 1335 cm -1 for b-CO 3 2-and 1375 cm -1 for monodentate carbonate (m-CO 3</p>
        <p>). [57] The peak intensity of b-HCO 3 species was higher than those of i-HCO - 3 at 553 K for In 13 /ZrO 2 . Additionally, the b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-species bands were more intense than the bicarbonate bands at this temperature. Thus, the features for carbonate species are much stronger than those for bicarbonate species at higher adsorption temperatures. [56] The CO 2 absorption bands observed on In 13 /CeO 2 at 1575 and 1315 cm -1 suggest the presence of b-CO 3 -2 at 493 K.</p>
        <p>When the temperature increased from 493 to 553 K, the b-CO 3 2-species began to disappear or their intensity decreased on the surface of In 13 / CeO 2, whereas the m-CO 3 2-and i-HCO - 3 species at 1375, and 1448 cm -1 , were detected at 553 K (Figure 6b). [32] In addition, time and temperature resolved spectra were collected during the introduction of 0.09 vol.% H 2 in Ar together with 0.03 vol.% CO 2 to maintain a 1:3 molar ratio and to study the CO 2 and H 2 interactions on the surface of In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 . When the sample was exposed to the H 2 atmosphere, new peaks related to methoxy groups around 2850 and 2937 cm -1 appeared at 493 K over In 13 /ZrO 2 (more intense) and In 13 /CeO 2 (less intense) along with carbonate and bicarbonate species (Figure 7). [58,59] The large peak around 2334-2364 cm - 1 is due to the presence of gas-phase CO 2 . The formate species were also observed at 1620, 1380, and 2740 cm -1 on the surface of In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 . [58,59] The intensity of formate peaks was higher over In 13 / ZrO 2 than In 13 /CeO 2 . The peaks disappeared in the case of In 13 /CeO 2 while they became more intense over In 13 /ZrO 2 when the temperature was increased from 493 to 553 K (Figure . 6). [60] In addition to this, various types of O-H bands between 3400-3700 cm -1 , which are related to bridge as well as hydrogen-bonded OH groups, were observed over In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure 7a). While over In 13 /CeO 2 , only two OH bands related to bridged species on Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ appeared at low temperatures which further disappeared at higher temperatures and only one OH band remained over the catalyst surface which is assigned to hydrogenbonded OH groups (Figure 7b). In the DRIFT experiments, the OH bands are weak and the reason for this is likely that DRIFT experiments are run at atmospheric pressure. It is well known that CO 2 hydrogenation requires higher pressure to increase the yield. The low conversion of CO 2 and thereby the low formation of water could explain why the OH bands are small. Anyhow, OH bands are visible, and it is likely that these species would be significantly larger at real operating conditions with high pressure hydrogen. It is therefore possible that at higher H 2 pressure the O-H groups could cover the surface of In 13 /CeO 2 , which could result in low CO 2 conversion and methanol selectivity. This hypothesis is supported by the XPS data where 30.8 % metal hydroxides was found over the spent In 13 /CeO 2 catalyst. The CO 2 adsorption and desorption were studied in TPD experiments for In 2 O 3 , In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 (Figure 8). A common desorption peak was below 550 K which was due to physisorbed CO 2 . [19] The peak above 550 K could be attributed to chemisorption of CO 2 from thermally induced oxygen vacancies. [18] It was difficult to distinguish the boundary between physio-and chemisorbed CO 2 peaks in the case of In 13 /CeO 2 . The total CO 2 desorbed values were 30, 181, and 191 µmol/g for In 2 O 3 , In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2, respectively. A significantly lower amount of CO 2 adsorption was found on the unsupported In 2 O compared to the supported catalysts, which was probably related to its substantially lower specific surface area. The total amount of CO 2 desorbed was higher on In 13 /CeO 2 than In 13 /ZrO 2 , which might be due to more oxygen defects on In 13 /CeO 2 , which is in-line with the XPS analysis (Figure 8a). [12,61] H 2 -TPR measurements were used to study the reduction behavior of the catalysts (Figure 8b). The H 2 -TPR profile of the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 exhibited two main stages of H 2 consumption. The first one was at approximately 531 K due to the reduction of the surface species while the second one started from around 798 K and the reduction was not complete even when it was prolonged at 1073 KC for 30 min. This is a typical behavior of In 2 O 3 as reported in the literature [62]. The H 2 -TPR profile of the In 13 /ZrO 2 sample showed two hydrogen consumption peaks at 513 and 943 K. We note that the ZrO 2 support consumed only a negligible amount of H 2 at around 943 K (data not shown). Therefore, the reduction of the In 2 O 3 component accounted mainly for the hydrogen consumption of the In 13 /ZrO 2 catalyst. However, the first peak was shifted to a lower temperature than that of the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 , suggesting that the reduction of In 2 O 3 was enhanced. Furthermore, the total area of the peaks was significantly smaller than that of the bulk In 2 O 3 because the In 13 /ZrO 2 contained a lower amount of In 2 O than the unsupported catalyst. In 13 /CeO 2 showed two H 2 uptakes at K and 1033 K. The total area of the two peaks was significantly higher than that of the In 13 /ZrO 2 . Because both catalysts had a similar loading of In 2 O 3 , this suggests that CeO 2 contributed to the hydrogen consumption of the In 13 /CeO 2 catalyst. Indeed, the CeO 2 support exhibited two peaks of hydrogen consumption. The first one started around 593 K and peaked at 843 K due to the reduction of surface CeO 2 while the second one began at approximately 953 K due to the reduction of bulk CeO 2 and it was not completed even at 1073 K for 30 min (data not shown). It should be noted that the first reduction peak (at 533 K) of the In 13 /CeO 2 was substantially larger than that on both unsupported In 2 O 3 and In 13 /ZrO 2 . This suggested that CeO 2 enhanced the reduction of In 2 O 3 . The quantification of H 2 consumption was not performed because the reduction was not completed for all three catalysts in the measured temperature range.</p>
        <p>The catalytic performance of the Indium supported (In x ) on CeO 2 and ZrO 2 was assessed, where Indium loading (x) was kept at 1 % and 13 %. The In 13 /ZrO 2 catalyst was tested at various temperatures from 493 to 573 at 3.0 MPa to examine the effect of reaction conditions on methanol synthesis (Figure 9). It was observed that the CO 2 conversion and CO selectivity increased with increasing temperature while the selectivity for CH 3 OH decreased because of the competition of the RWGS reaction at high temperatures, which is in line with previous studies. [18] The In 13 /ZrO 2 catalyst exhibited 100 % CH 3 OH selectivity with 0.6 % CO 2 conversion at 493 K. Increasing the temperature to 573 K, resulted in the CO 2 conversion increasing to 12.7 %, while the CH 3 OH selectivity dropped to 57.3 % and the CO selectivity was 42.3% (Figure 9). In addition, the CH 4 selectivity also increased from 0 to 0.21 % with increasing temperature from 493 to 573 K.</p>
        <p>Figure 10 shows that the combination of In 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 improved significantly the CO 2 conversion as compared to its individual components. Activity measurements for each catalyst were performed at 493, 553 and 573 K. After the temperature reached the set value, the reaction was prolonged at this temperature for about 1 h while the outlet gas was continuously analyzed. We report the data near the end of this period. At 553 K, the CO 2 conversions over the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 and ZrO support were negligible while it significantly increased from 0.6 % (over bulk In 2 O 3 ) to 7.9 % over In 13 /ZrO 2 . Both samples of CeO 2 -supported In catalysts showed lower conversion of CO 2 than the unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 but higher than the CeO 2 support. The CO 2 conversion increased with increasing temperature over In 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 , In x /ZrO 2 and In x /CeO 2 . Surprisingly, the conversion decreased over CeO 2 when increasing the temperature, however, it should be noted that the conversions over CeO 2 were very low over the entire temperature span investigated. The change in CO 2 conversion over In x /CeO 2 with increasing temperature was more moderate compared to that with In x /ZrO 2 . The low increment in the conversion of CO 2 with increasing temperature for the CeO 2 -based catalysts raises some suspicion that there is a factor that makes these catalysts unstable under the operating conditions of the reaction and this will be further discussed in Section 3.8. The CO 2 conversion increased with increasing In loading from 1 % to 13 % over both supports. Thus, the further characterizations were carried out with 13 % In loading catalysts and are discussed here in detail.</p>
        <p>The CH 3 OH selectivity decreased with increasing temperature from 493 to 573 K over all catalysts due to the competition of the RWGS reaction at high temperatures. Notably, methanol was the main product when the In loading was 13 % while CO was the main product with 1 % In loading at 573 K for both the supported catalysts. At 493 K, the selectivity for CH 3 OH increased from 68 % to 85 % as the loading of In increased from 1 % to 13 %. Wang et al. found that the activity of bulk ZrO 2 was negligible, with only 0.18 % CO 2 conversion at 573 K. [13] The CH 4 selectivity also increased with increasing temperature over all catalysts from 493 to 573 K. Additionally, In x /CeO 2 exhibited higher selectivity towards CH 4 than In x /ZrO 2 for both In loadings . The CeO exhibited negligible conversion. After loading In over CeO 2 , it became active toward methanol synthesis. Further, the CH 3 OH selectivity decreased, and the CO selectivity increased over In x /CeO 2 , when the temperature increased from 493 to 573 K. The change in selectivity for CH 3 OH and CO was much less when In loading was 13 %. The In x /CeO showed higher methanol selectivity as compared to In x /ZrO 2 with both levels of In loading at 553 and 573 K. However, the maximum methanol STY at 553 K and 3.0 MPa was 0.17 and 0.007 g MeOH h -1 g cat -1 over In 13 / ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 , respectively .</p>
        <p>Stability is a key factor to determine the use of catalysts for CH 3 OH synthesis from CO 2 hydrogenation on an industrial scale. The stability test of bulk In 2 O 3 , In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 was performed at 553 K and 3.0 MPa because the catalysts exhibited the best STY of methanol at this condition. Figure 11 compares the methanol STY versus the time-onstream over bulk In 2 O 3 , In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 . The In 13 /ZrO 2 and bulk In 2 O 3 catalysts were found to be stable for the entire duration of 12 h, whereas methanol STY of In 13 /CeO 2 decreased dramatically from the beginning to 2 h of time-on-stream and then dropped steadily till the end of the test at 12 h. Further, the stability test for In 13 /ZrO 2 was prolonged and the methanol STY was stable up to 50 h of time-on-stream (Figure S7). The deactivation will be discussed in Section 4.</p>
        <p>The selectivity for CH 3 OH was higher for In 13 /CeO 2 than In 13 /ZrO 2 at 553 K while the STY for CH 3 OH was higher over In 13 /ZrO 2 than In 13 / CeO 2 . The positive effect of CeO 2 in CO 2 hydrogenation has been reported in terms of CH 3 OH selectivity when ZrO 2 was partially replaced by CeO 2 . [63] In the DRIFT study, more bi-carbonates, formats, and methoxy species were observed over In 13 /ZrO 2 . The higher activity of In 13 /ZrO 2 than our unsupported bulk In 2 O 3 is likely due to the significantly higher surface area. In addition, we observed an interaction between ZrO 2 and In 2 O 3 in XRD and it has been reported that this interaction increased the stability of various intermediates like *CO 2 , *CO, *HCO, and *H 2 CO which could give a higher activity of In 13 /ZrO 2 . [25,64] During the reaction period, the STY of CH 3 OH was constant for In 13 / ZrO 2 while it approached zero for In 13 /CeO 2 with time. These results show that the In 13 /CeO 2 catalyst deactivated after 12 h on stream. Similar deactivation has been observed in the case of a Pd/CeO 2 catalyst for CO 2 hydrogenation. [65] To further understand the deactivation of In 13 /CeO 2, we have characterized the catalyst before and after reaction (spent catalyst) using XRD, N 2 physisorption and XPS. The XRD measurements (Figure 1) revealed that the crystallite size of the ceria support increased in the spent catalyst, which is a sign of sintering of the support material. Moreover, the specific surface area also decreased from 66 to 48 m 2 /g which also suggests that the support sintered during the reaction. Interestingly, the XPS data also revealed that the In(OH) species were still present over spent In 13 /CeO 2 while they disappeared in the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 (Figure S6a). Moreover, the In 0 /In 2 O 3 ratio also changed significantly differently between In 13 /ZrO 2 and In 13 /CeO 2 after the reaction. The ratio of In 0 /In 2 O 3 increased 2.2-fold for In 13 /ZrO whereas it decreased by 2.6-fold for In 13 /CeO 2 . This suggested that In 2 O 3 in In 13 /ZrO 2 was reduced further while metallic In in In 13 /CeO was partially oxidized after the reaction. Furthermore, it was also noted that more Ce 3+ was present in the spent In 13 /CeO 2 while a small fraction of Zr 0 was also detected for the spent In 13 /ZrO 2 . This indicated that the supports (CeO 2 and ZrO 2 ) were partially reduced after the hydrogenation reaction; however, the reduction of CeO 2 is easier than ZrO 2 to some extent as also observed from H 2 -TPR. A redox pair of Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ and In 0 / In 3+ may explain an increase in the amount of Ce 3+ and a decrease in the amount of In 0 in the In 13 /CeO 2 after the reaction, and this is in line with the H 2 -TPR data. Also, from DRIFTs measurements OH groups were visible although at low levels, likely due to low conversion and low water formation in the DRIFT experiments since they were performed at atmospheric pressure. Here, water should play a crucial role in the deactivation of the catalyst as it is a side product of CO 2 hydrogenation. Therefore it might be possible that the produced water can deactivate the active sites of the catalyst. [65] It has been reported and confirmed that CeO 2 is a good absorbent for water molecules due to its hydrophilic nature and a very stable configuration of water has been observed on the surface of CeO 2. [37] It was also observed in the DRIFT study that the bands related to methoxy, formate and carbonate species disappeared at higher temperature over In 13 /CeO 2 , indicating less adsorption of CO 2 molecules over CeO 2 at higher temperature. [66,67] However, the presence of water molecules around the In surface could create a physical hindrance for the CO 2 molecules and also cause sintering of In. [18] To summarize, In 13 /CeO 2 has a high initial selectivity for methanol production, but it rapidly deactivates with time on stream. In 13 /ZrO 2 on the other hand exhibited a stable methanol production during the 50 h long experiment. The deactivation of In 13 /CeO 2 is likely linked to a sintering of support which caused lower surface area and the redox property of CeO 2 which induced the oxidation of metallic In.</p>
        <p>In 13 /ZrO 2 catalysts were found to be stable at 533 K and 3.0 MPa whereas the In 13 /CeO 2 catalyst showed severe deactivation after only a few hours of time on stream. A regeneration study of In 13 /CeO 2 was therefore carried out at 533 K and 3.0 MPa to determine the type of deactivation (Figure 12). After the reaction, the catalyst was flushed with Ar (50 Nml/min), while the reactor was cooled from reaction temperature to room temperature and further maintained in Ar flow overnight. The next day, the Ar flow was switched to reactant feed and the temperature was increased from room temperature to reaction temperature. It was observed that the STY for methanol decreased during the first day under reaction conditions. Further, the catalyst bed was flushed and tested again on the second day at the same reaction conditions. The STY was partially recovered from the previous day but again started to decrease with time. This process was again repeated on the third day and a similar phenomenon was observed, although at significantly lower STY levels. It can be stated that some part of deactivation is reversible as the STY increased after flushing with Ar. Thus, due to the strong hydrophilic character of the CeO 2 carrier, significant amounts of water form and assemble on the catalyst during the reaction. The water could inhibit CO 2 hydrogenation, and we suggest that it could be partly removed after Ar flushing from the CeO 2 surface and thereby increasing the CO 2 adsorption and methanol formation. However, the decreased surface area is not reversible, and the catalyst could therefore not gain the original state back, which could be the reason behind the continuous overall deactivation of the catalyst over the three days observed in Figure 12.</p>
        <p>To uncover the effect of ZrO 2 and CeO 2 supports on In 2 O 3 activity in the hydrogenation of CO 2 to methanol, In 2 O 3 supported on ZrO 2 and CeO 2 catalysts were prepared. The selectivity for CH 3 OH was higher for In 13 /CeO 2 than In 13 /ZrO 2 at 553 K, but the CH 3 OH yield was higher over In 13 /ZrO 2 . For the In 13 /ZrO 2 the CO 2 conversion and CO selectivity increased with increasing temperature while the selectivity for CH 3 OH decreased. In addition, some methane was formed, which increased with temperature. A large drawback with the In 13 /CeO 2 sample was that it deactivated severely with time on stream and already after 2 h a significant deactivation was observed. In 13 /ZrO 2 , on the other hand, exhibited a stable behavior during 50 h on stream. The spent catalysts were characterized to understand the different behavior of In 13 /CeO 2 than In 13 /ZrO 2 during the time on stream. The XPS results revealed that during the reaction the ratio of In 0 /In 2 O 3 increased from 0.29 to 0.65 for the In 13 /ZrO 2 whereas it decreased from 0.88 to 0.34 for the In 13 /CeO 2 . The data suggest that the redox property of CeO 2 (Ce 3+ ion increased from 18 to 45 % in the spent In 13 /CeO 2 ) induced the oxidation of metallic In and increased the amount of In 2 O 3 . Moreover, the percentage of In(OH) 3 was 30.8 % over the spent In 13 /CeO 2 whereas it became zero over the spent In 13 /ZrO 2. In addition, OH groups were found during DRIFT experiments, although at low levels likely due to that the experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure, resulting in low conversion and thereby low water production. We, therefore, propose that the water produced during reaction results in the formation of hydroxyls on the In 13 /CeO 2 , which was one of the deactivating factors. However, this is not the main reason for the deactivation, because XRD experiments showed that the sintering of CeO 2 support (larger crystallite size) for the spent In 13 /CeO 2 catalyst. In addition, the specific surface area also decreased due to sintering, while it remained the same for In 13 / ZrO 2 . Thus, the structural changes, presence of more OH groups (hydrophilic nature) and the decreased surface area of spent In 13 /CeO 2 after the reaction are the reasons for the decreased activity. Further, a regeneration study of In 13 /CeO 2 was conducted and that revealed that the catalyst can be regenerated to some extent by flushing the catalyst with Ar. However, repeated reaction-regeneration cycles revealed that the conversion continued to decrease after the regeneration and was even lower after subsequent cycles. To conclude, the water adsorption on In 13 /CeO 2 is partly reversible and the catalyst can therefore gain back some activity after Ar flushing, but the structural changes are not reversible and cause a continuous deactivation. In 13 /ZrO 2 , on the other hand, exhibited a stable behavior during the reaction conditions used in this study.</p>
