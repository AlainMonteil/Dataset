        <p>Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction is attractive for solar-to-fuels conversion and carbon neutrality. [1][2][3][4][5] However, current performance for CO 2 photoreduction is considered unsatisfactory because of the following two reasons. [1] First, the inertness of the CO 2 molecule; nonelectric dipoles, and strong C═O double bonds limit adsorption and activation. [6,7] Secondly, the intrinsic multi-electron process requires greater electron accumulation and utilization. [8] The creation of electron localization and delocalization therefore for surface electron redistribution to interact with C or O atoms in CO 2 molecules favors breaking the electronic structure symmetry of linear CO 2 . Advantageously, the length and angle of C═O bonds can then be changed and CO 2 molecule is activated. Moreover, localized electrons provide sufficient electrons for CO 2 reduction. [8,9] A number of surface modification strategies including the introduction of surface defects, [10][11][12][13][14][15][16] grafted groups, [17,18] and heterogeneous metal atoms, [19][20][21][22][23][24] have been reported to redistribute electrons and activate CO 2 molecules. Among these, metal sites are of interest because surface electron distribution can be flexibly adjusted via phase/size engineering. [8,[25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] These are however significantly affected by the element, coordinated environment, substrate types, and space of active atoms. [31,32] For example, Pd nanoparticles (NPs) accept electrons from TiO 2 nanosheets via acting as an electron reservoir to boost charge separation/transfer. [33] With the size of metal nanoparticles reduced to a single atom (SA) however, the impact of metal sites and mechanism of electron transfer/distribution becomes more complex. [30,34,35] For instance, contrary to that for Pd NPs, Pd SA reversed electron transfer direction and donated the electron to the supporting TiO 2 nanosheets. [33] In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) evidenced that Pt SA attracts electrons from the hosting semiconductor and accumulates electrons for reduction. [36] Moreover, the matrix also impacts the photo-generated electron transfer direction. For example, surface electron density and transfer direction can be modulated via the different types of vacancies on CdS NPs. [8] These findings established that different metal sites and matrixes induce opposite electron flows, resulting in different regions where electrons are localized or delocalized. [37] A question then is what is the ability to promote the surface electron separation/transfer/accumulation via modulating the electron flow between SAs toward desired reactions including, for example, CO 2 reduction.Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reaction is attractive for solar-to-fuels conversion and carbon neutrality.

        <p>DSA-loaded catalysts can be used to establish tunable atomic configurations to modify electron distribution via asymmetric atomic sites. [38][39][40][41] Significantly, reported findings about DSAs, e.g., Ni/Cu, [42] Ni/Fe, [43] and Ir/Fe [44] systems, highlight the importance of incorporating heterogeneous atomic sites, namely, 1) optimizing the reaction thermodynamics, 2) improve reaction kinetics, and 3) modulating electronic interactions between atoms for complex surface redox reactions. There are however reported findings on modulating the charge distribution between heterogeneous atomic sites as practically challenging to establish charge dynamics in photocatalysts, especially the charge transfer mechanism in DSA-loaded catalysts. Confirmation of a distinct DSA system loaded on a matrix in which one type of SA localizes electrons for reduction while the other delocalizes electrons to boost the enrichment of electrons, are therefore of potential practical significance.DSA-loaded catalysts can be used to establish tunable atomic configurations to modify electron distribution via asymmetric atomic sites.

        <p>Here, we report the design and evaluation of Au/Co DSAloaded CdS NPs for the first time. We confirm a mechanism for surface photo-generated electron/hole redistribution for CO 2 conversion via judiciously combined in situ characterizations and theoretical computation. We show that compared with Au or Co SA alone, Au and Co atoms in the DSA system, respectively, delocalize and localize electrons. We evidence that the electron-rich Co atoms more readily adsorb/activate CO 2 molecules to significantly boost photocatalytic CO 2 reduction and charge accumulation and depletion area via in situ tests and calculations. It is concluded that reversed electron transfer in DSA can be used for practical design to boost photoreduction of CO 2 . Findings will be of benefit to researchers and manufacturers in the design of DSA-loaded catalysts for solar fuel generation.Here, we report the design and evaluation of Au/Co DSAloaded CdS NPs for the first time.

        <p>CdS was selected as the matrix material because of its facile synthesis and excellent photocatalytic performance. Co SA loaded CdS NPs are denoted as, respectively, CC1 and CC2, based on Co loading. Au SA-loaded CdS NPs are denoted as CA1 and CA2, respectively, because of different Au loading. Au/Co DSAs loaded CdS NPs are denoted as, respectively, CAC1, CAC2, CAC3, and CAC4, because of differing Au, or Co loading. Details for the synthesis of the catalysts are given in Supporting Information. The SA/DSA catalysts were assessed via combined X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping. As can be seen in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), no diffraction peaks from metallic crystals in XRD patterns (cubic CdS, JCPDS #10-0454) were detected, evidencing the absence of Co or Au particles. The as-synthesized CdS NPs exhibited a mean size of 19.7 nm (Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information). The HAADF-STEM image (Figure S2c, Supporting Information) evidenced a lattice distance of 0.34 nm, assigned to the (111) facet of cubic CdS. Following loading Au/Co DSAs on CdS NPs, the morphology and crystal structure were established. From Figure 1a,b, it is seen that CAC2 exhibits the same morphology and crystal structure as that for CdS NPs (Figure S2, Supporting Information). However, SAs were evidenced on CAC2 using atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM-these are highlighted by yellow-color circles (Figure 1c). These are attributed to Au SAs (Figure S3, Supporting Information), because the atomic number for Cd of z = 48 is greater than that for Co of z = 27, however lower than that for Au (z = 79). Figure 1c evidences lattice spacing of 0.21 nm, attributed to the (220) facet of cubic CdS. The HAADF-STEM and corresponding EDX elemental mapping images of CAC2, Figure 1d, confirm the homogeneous loading of Au and Co on CdS NPs. CA2 and CC2 were assessed via XRD (Figure S1, Supporting Information) and HAADF-STEM with EDX elemental mapping (Figures S4 andS5, Supporting Information) with findings evidencing homogeneous loading of Au and Co SA on CdS NPs for CA2 and CC2, respectively. Raman spectra (Figure S6, Supporting Information) evidenced the existence of Co─S bond at ≈660 cm -1 for both CC2 and CAC2. [45][46][47] Additionally, the existence of Au─S bond at ≈400 cm -1 was evidenced for both CA2 and CAC2. [45][46][47] It was concluded therefore that findings confirmed the successful loading of Au/Co DSAs for CAC2, Au SA for CA2, and Co SA for CC2.CdS was selected as the matrix material because of its facile synthesis and excellent photocatalytic performance.

        <p>To establish the valence state and coordination environment of Au or Co SA, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of CAC2, CA2, and CC2 were determined. The XANES spectra for Au L 3 -edge, Figure 2a, evidenced the higher oxidation state for Au in CA2 or CAC2 (Au 𝛿+ , 𝛿 &gt; 0), compared with that for Au-foil. The EXAFS spectra for Au-foil, Figure 2b, exhibited two peaks at ≈2.5 and ≈2.9 Å, which were attributed to typical Au─Au scattering. EXAFS spectra for both CA2 and CAC2, Figure 2b, exhibit a prominent peak at ≈1.8 Å, which is assigned to the Au─S bonds and with the absence of Au─Au bonds. This finding confirms the successful loading of SA Au in both CA2 and CAC2. Significantly, the XANES spectra of Co K edge (Figure 2c) evidence the higher oxidation states of Co in CC2 or CAC2, compared with that for Co-foil. The EXAFS spectra for Co-foil (Figure 2d) exhibit one peak at ≈2.2 Å, which is attributed to Co─Co scattering. The absence of Co─Co scattering and the existence of characteristic peak assigned to Co─S contribution at ≈1.8 Å (Figure 2d) evidence the SA status of Co in both CC2 and CAC2. The fitted EX-AFS (Figure S7 and Table S1, Supporting Information) demonstrate that the Au─S and Co─S are ≈2 and 4 coordinated, respectively. It is concluded these findings confirm the SA status and the coordination of Au and Co on CdS NPs.To establish the valence state and coordination environment of Au or Co SA, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of CAC2, CA2, and CC2 were determined.

        <p>To reinforce coordination data, wavelet transform analysis of the k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra for CAC2, CA2, CC2, and reference metal foils were determined, Figure 2e-h (and Figure S8, Supporting Information). The maximum intensity for Au L 3 -edge spectra of CA2 and CAC2 in Figure 2e,f is at 8.5 Å -1 that is attributed to Au─S configuration. The maximum intensity for Co K-edge spectra in Figure 2g,h is at 5 Å -1 for CC2 or CAC2, corresponding to Co─S configuration. In contrast the maximum intensity for Au L 3 -edge and Co K-edge spectra in Figure S8a (Supporting Information) (Au-foil) and b (Co-foil) are located at 10 and 7.5 Å -1 , respectively, and are attributed to Co─Co and Au─Au configuration. These findings were concluded to confirm the absence of Co─Co or/and Au─Au bond in CA2, CC2, and CAC2. This corroborates the SA nature of Co or/and Au in CA2, CC2, and CAC2. For CAC2, no Au─Co configuration is evidenced in Figure 2b,d,f,g, confirming the absence of Co─Au alloy in CAC2, and evidencing that Co and Au are atomically dispersed in CAC2.To reinforce coordination data, wavelet transform analysis of the k 3 -weighted EXAFS spectra for CAC2, CA2, CC2, and reference metal foils were determined, Figure 2e-h (and Figure S8, Supporting Information).

        <p>To visualize the different configuration/loading for DSA for CO 2 photoreduction activity findings are presented in Figure 3a. It is seen in the figure that CdS exhibits limited CO 2 photoreduction yields for CO of 2.3 μmol g -1 and CH 4 of 1.12 μmol g -1 . SA Au loaded CdS NPs, however boosts CO 2 photoreduction for both CA1, namely, CO: 24.3 μmol g -1 and CH 4 : 2.6 μmol g -1 , and CA2, CO: 13.7 μmol g -1 and CH 4 3.3 μmol g -1 . Compared with CA1, CA2 exhibits reduced CO yield, however an increased CH 4 yield, Figure 3a. A similar trend was found for SA Co-loaded CdS NPs (CC1 and CC2). As is seen in Figure 3a, compared with those for CdS alone, increased CO 2 photoreduction is apparent for both CC1 (CO: 11.4 μmol g -1 and CH 4 : 1.9 μmol g -1 ) and CC2 (CO: 8.8 μmol g -1 and CH 4 : 5.1 μmol g -1 ). Compared with CC1, CC2 exhibits a decreased CO yield and an increased CH 4 yield, Figure 3a. It is concluded therefore that loading SA Au or Co on CdS NPs significantly increases yield for CO and CH 4 . The greater loading for SA Au (CA2) or Co (CC2) leads to the greater higher of 8-electrons/protons involved reaction product, CH 4 . These findings might arise from the available electrons accumulated around SA Au in CA2 or SA Co in CC2, compared with that in CA1 or CC1. CC2 exhibited the greatest CH 4 yield of 5.1 μmol g -1 , evidencing that SA Co is more favorable for CH 4 generation compared with SA Au. Au/Co DSA-loaded CdS NPs (CAC1, CAC2, CAC3, and CAC4) were assessed for CO 2 photoreduction. The four samples exhibited the same loading of SA Au, except that the loading for SA Co was gradually increased from CAC1 to CAC4. CAC2 exhibited the greatest CO 2 photoreduction yields, CO: 64.1 μmol g -1 and CH 4 : 7.7 μmol g -1 , as is seen in Figure 3a. Compared with CAC2, further increasing SA Co content in CAC3 and CAC4 resulted in reduced yields for both CO and CH 4 , Figure 3a. It is hypothesized that these findings arise because of a "shielding effect" via excessive loading of SA Co. The actual metal site concentration of Table S2 (Supporting Information) demonstrates that CAC2 is not the greatest loading metal sample, importantly, evidencing the boosted performance does not originate from increasing loaded metal sites.To visualize the different configuration/loading for DSA for CO 2 photoreduction activity findings are presented in Figure 3a.

        <p>To determine the role of Au/Co DSAs in CO 2 photoreduction, a series of DSA-loaded CdS NPs were synthesized including, Au/Ni DSA (CAN2), Au/In DSA (CAI2) and Pt/Co DSA (CPC2), and tested. Detailed preparation and testing are included in Supporting Information. As presented in Figure 3b, CAC2 exhibits the greatest CO yield of 9.2 μmol g -1 and the second-highest CH 4 yield of 1.1 μmol g -1 . It is concluded that these findings confirm the unique and strong synergistic effect in Au/Co DSA for CO 2 photoreduction CPC2 exhibited significantly low CO 2 photoreduction yields for, CO: 3.6 μmol g -1 and CH 4 : 4.4 μmol g -1 . This is attributed to the strong absorption of CO on Pt that, is not favorable for the generation of CO or CH 4 . [48] Stability and reproducibility for CAC2 were established. Following four-time recycles (28 h), CO and CH 4 yields were ≈80% of the first cycle, Figure 3c. Compared with independently reported values, Table S3 (Supporting Information), CAC2 exhibited excellent CO 2 photoreduction under similar conditions, confirming the superiority of DSA materials. XRD, XPS, and TEM and electron diffraction (Figures S9-13, Supporting Information) findings following performance testing evidenced no apparent changes, confirming high stability of the crystal structures and loaded metal sites. To determine the effect of possible carbon impurities, blank experiments with negligible products were conducted in ultrahigh purity argon rather than CO 2. Findings confirmed the negligible influence of carbon impurities (Figure S14, Supporting Information) and that CO and CH 4 were generated from photocatalytic CO 2 reduction.To determine the role of Au/Co DSAs in CO 2 photoreduction, a series of DSA-loaded CdS NPs were synthesized including, Au/Ni DSA (CAN2), Au/In DSA (CAI2) and Pt/Co DSA (CPC2), and tested.

        <p>To establish the origin of boosted activity and reaction mechanism, a range of state-of-the-art characterizations and theoretical computations were conducted. As is seen in Figure 3d, the absorption edges of the samples are located at 558 nm, evidencing the same band gap width of 2.22 eV. Compared with CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 exhibited boosted light absorption in the range ≈560 to 800 nm. To determine the effect of this boosted light absorption, CO 2 photoreduction was conducted under the same reaction conditions, except for the substitution of visible light with a 630 nm light-emitting diode (LED) light. Low yields were exhibited in all samples (Figure S15, Supporting Information), evidencing limited contribution of boosted light absorption to activity. To establish electronic band structures XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Figure S16, Supporting Information) and Mott-Schottky plots were determined (Figure S17, Supporting Information). As can be seen in Figure S16 (Supporting Information), the XPS VB edges of CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at 1.5, 1.3, 1.2, and 1.2 eV, respectively. The Mott-Schottky plots (Figure S17, Supporting Information) evidenced that the flat band potentials for CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at, respectively, -0.90, -0.97, -1.02 and -1.01 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. The Fermi levels for CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 were estimated to be at, -0.30, -0.37, -0.42, and -0.41 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The actual VB edges of CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at 1.20, 0.93, 0.78, and 0.79 V versus RHE. Therefore the conduction band (CB) edges of CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at -1.02, -1.29, -1.44, and -1.43 V versus RHE. As is seen in Figure 3e, compared with the CB edge of CdS, the CB edges of CA2, CC2, and CAC2 exhibit upshift, evidencing greater reduction ability of photo-generated electrons for CO 2 photoreduction.To establish the origin of boosted activity and reaction mechanism, a range of state-of-the-art characterizations and theoretical computations were conducted.

To establish electronic band structures XPS valence band (VB) spectra (Figure S16, Supporting Information) and Mott-Schottky plots were determined (Figure S17, Supporting Information). As can be seen in Figure S16 (Supporting Information), the XPS VB edges of CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at 1.5, 1.3, 1.2, and 1.2 eV, respectively. The Mott-Schottky plots (Figure S17, Supporting Information) evidenced that the flat band potentials for CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at, respectively, -0.90, -0.97, -1.02 and -1.01 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. The Fermi levels for CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 were estimated to be at, -0.30, -0.37, -0.42, and -0.41 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The actual VB edges of CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at 1.20, 0.93, 0.78, and 0.79 V versus RHE. Therefore the conduction band (CB) edges of CdS, CA2, CC2, and CAC2 are at -1.02, -1.29, -1.44, and -1.43 V versus RHE. As is seen in Figure 3e, compared with the CB edge of CdS, the CB edges of CA2, CC2, and CAC2 exhibit upshift, evidencing greater reduction ability of photo-generated electrons for CO 2 photoreduction.</p>
        <p>To determine the photo-generated charge dissociation/transfer, transient-state photoluminescence (TSPL) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent (TPC) density measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted. As can be seen in Figure S18 and Table S4 (Supporting Information), the "averaged charge lifetimes" (𝜏 ave ) are shortened for CA2 (𝜏 ave = 3.18 ns), CC2, (𝜏 ave = 3.37 ns) and CAC2 (𝜏 ave = 2.73 ns), in contrast to that for CdS (𝜏 ave = 3.87 ns). It is concluded that these findings confirm that loading SA Au and/or SA Co significantly promotes charge transfer. [8] The 𝜏 ave ranking is, CdS &gt; CC2 &gt; CA2 &gt; CAC2, and is in reverse with photocatalytic CO yield, namely, CAC2 &gt; CA2 &gt; CC2 &gt; CdS; Figure 3a. Significantly, these findings evidence a strong synergistic effect of loading Au/Co DSA in boosting charge migration that is confirmed via TPC density measurement (Figure S19, Supporting Information) and EIS spectra (Figure S20, Supporting Information). CAC2 exhibited the greatest TPC density among samples, evidencing the greatest charge separation efficiency via loading Au/Co DSA (Figure S19, Supporting Information). CAC2 exhibited the least charge transfer resistance of R ct = 197 Ω, compared with CdS of R ct = 4300 Ω, CA2 (R ct = 2600 Ω), and CC2 (R ct = 3050 Ω), as can be seen in Figure S20 (Supporting Information). It can be concluded therefore TSPL, TPC and EIS findings confirm the greatest charge separation/migration efficiency in CAC2 by Au/Co DSA deposition.To determine the photo-generated charge dissociation/transfer, transient-state photoluminescence (TSPL) spectroscopy, transient photocurrent (TPC) density measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted.

        <p>To determine how the Au/Co DSA boosts charge separation/transfer in CAC2, combined in situ characterizations and theoretical computation were conducted. CA2, CC2, and CAC2 were characterized via in situ XPS. As is seen in Figure 4a, with light-on, the Au 4f peaks for CA2 exhibit a left-shift of 0.7 eV to the lower binding energy direction, compared with those with light-off. This finding evidences the transfer of photo-generated electrons from CdS to SA Au in CA2 with light illumination. Similarly, Figure 4b evidences the migration of photo-generated electrons from CdS to SA Co in CC2 with light-on. With light-on, the Au 4f peaks for CAC2 exhibit a right-shift of 0.2 eV to higher binding energy direction, Figure 4c, while the Co 2p peaks for CAC2 exhibit a left-shift of 0.4 eV to lower binding energy direction, Figure 4d. The shift of these peaks evidences that the surface electrons are localized around different areas that were positively or negatively charged.To determine how the Au/Co DSA boosts charge separation/transfer in CAC2, combined in situ characterizations and theoretical computation were conducted.

        <p>These findings evidence the transfer of photo-generated electrons to SA Co, while the holes to Au in CAC2 separately. Therefore with light illumination, photo-generated electrons are localized around SA Co and delocalized from SA Au on CAC2. Density functional theory (DFT) based theoretical computation simulated electron redistribution and mechanism. As seen in Figure 4e, with additional electrons in the Au/Co DSA loaded CdS, there is formed an electron accumulation area around SA Co while an electron depletion area is formed around Au SA, as evidenced via charge density difference. [48,49] The localized electrons around SA Co were analyzed via Bader charge. It can be seen from Figure S21 S5 (Supporting Information). More uncaptured electrons evidence a more electron-deficiency of atoms, confirming weaker ability to capture electrons. [41,50] As can be seen in Table S5 (Supporting Information), CAC exhibits less uncaptured electrons in Co (1.2) compared with CC (1.8), however, more uncaptured electrons in Au (1.1) compared with CA (0.4). Co in CAC therefore exhibits greater ability to capture electrons compared with Co in CC; Au in CAC exhibits lesser ability to capture electrons compared with Au in CA. To establish internal factors affecting electron redistribution, the potential profiles for CA, CC, and CAC models were computed. Findings evidenced that photogenerated charges can be redistributed between Co and Au SAs on the CdS nanoparticles under illumination, Figure 4f. As is seen in Figure 4g and Figure S23 (Supporting Information), along the x-axis of CAC model, the potential energy of CdS is greater than that for Co, however it is lesser than that for Au. The electrostatic driving force therefore boosts electron transfer from Au to CdS and CdS to Co, resulting in different electron localizations. In contrast, for CA or CC models, Au or Co exhibits a lower potential energy than for CdS (Figures S24 andS25, Supporting Information), resulting in the driving force from CdS to SA Au or Co. This results in electron localization around SA Au or Co. The in situ XPS findings, together with computations therefore confirm electron localization around SA Co/Au. However, electron delocalization around Au and localization around Co in CAC leads to the promoted charge redistribution in CAC2.These findings evidence the transfer of photo-generated electrons to SA Co, while the holes to Au in CAC2 separately.

        <p>The adsorption, activation, and reduction of CO 2 were determined via combining advanced characterizations and DFT com-putation. Because the adsorption of CO 2 on the catalyst surface is necessary as a prerequisite for CO 2 conversion, the behavior of CO 2 adsorption on catalysts using CO 2 temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) we established. As is seen in Figure 5a, the desorption of absorbed *CO 2 can conveniently be categorized into three temperature regions, 50-180, 180-350, and &gt;350 °C that correspond to, respectively, weak, moderate, and strong CO 2 adsorption active sites. No apparent CO 2 desorption signal was exhibited for CdS, Figure 5a, evidencing the absence of CO 2 adsorption sites on bare CdS. In contrast, CA2 or CC2 exhibited significantly stronger CO 2 desorption signals in the region &gt;350 °C, Figure 5a, evidencing that the loaded SA Au or Co is the strong active site that absorbs CO 2 molecules. Significantly, CAC2 exhibited the strongest CO 2 desorption signals in the region &gt;350 °C, Figure 5a, demonstrating the synergistic effect of loading Au/Co DSA as strong active sites for CO 2 adsorption. To establish the chemisorbed species on catalysts, in situ DRIFTS spectra were determined in CO 2 atmosphere and darkness. The data of Figure 5b confirm several intermediates for CO 2 chemisorption including typical intermediates for generating products. As is seen in Figure 5b, the peaks at 1355 and 1547 cm -1 can be attributed to bidentate carbonate (b-CO 3 2-) and monodentate carbonates (m-CO 3 2-), respectively. [51] The formation of HCO 3 -via coadsorption of H 2 O and CO 2 is evidenced via the peaks at 1637, 1438, and 1190 cm -1 (Figure 5b). [52,53] The rising peak at 1650 cm -1 with increasing time is from the vibration of •CO 2 -, an important indicator for the yield of CH 4 . [9] The strong signals for chemisorbed species on CAC2 (Figure 5b) evidence the high concentration of chemisorbed species, because of the high affinity of Au/Co DSA for CO 2 molecules. This ability of CAC2 is important to CO 2 photoreduction. In contrast, CdS exhibits significantly weaker signals in the same condition (Figure S26a, Supporting Information) because of significantly less adsorbed surface moieties. Compared with CAC2, CA2 exhibited similar signals for chemisorbed species, however with reduced intensity, especially for the signal for b-CO 3 2-(Figure S27a, Supporting Information). Significantly, the signal for m-CO 3 2-was significantly reduced for CC2 in the same conditions (Figure S28a, Supporting Information). It is concluded therefore that findings confirm the strongest CO 2 adsorption ability of CAC2 via loading Au/Co DSA. The surface oxidation reaction in water vapor provides protons for CO 2 reduction. Importantly, the in situ DRIFTS findings are consistent with the CO 2 TPD findings (Figure 5a). To establish CO 2 chemisorption on CAC2, DFT computation was used. As shown in Figure 5c,d, more electrons are transferred from CAC to CO 2 compared with those from CC to CO 2 , confirming CO 2 adsorption/activation by Au/Co DSA in CAC2.The adsorption, activation, and reduction of CO 2 were determined via combining advanced characterizations and DFT com-putation.

        <p>To establish a mechanistic understanding of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction with the DSAs, in situ DRIFTS spectra were determined in CO 2 atmosphere and under light illumination. With light illumination as an indicator for CO 2 to CO conversion, *COOH at 1667 cm -1 was detected on CAC2, Figure 5e. This is an important intermediate. Fast conversion of COOH leads to weak signals in the spectrum.

        <p>-, b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-, are significantly increased with increasing illumination time, confirming that CO 2 is more readily activated with light illumination to supply increased intermediates for conversion on CAC2. Additionally, some new bands, e.g., *CHO, *CH 2 O, *CH 3 O, and *CH 3 , were observed for CAC2, Figure 5e, which are important intermediates for CH 4 generation. [9,50] The signals for in situ DRIFTS spectra for CdS (Figure S26b, Supporting Information), CA2, (Figure S27b, Supporting Information), and CC2 (Figure S28b, Supporting Information) are, in contrast, significantly weaker, confirming the strongest CO 2 adsorption/activation/reduction ability of CAC2 with light illumination. Based on these, and in situ DRIFTS findings for CAC2, a reaction pathway is hypothesized, namely: *CO 2 → HCO 3-, b-CO 3 2-and m-CO 3 2-, are significantly increased with increasing illumination time, confirming that CO 2 is more readily activated with light illumination to supply increased intermediates for conversion on CAC2.

        <p>This pathway was simulated via DFT computation of the corresponding free energy change (ΔG) for each reaction step, Figure 5f,g, on CAC and CC. As can be seen in Figure S29 (Supporting Information), the overall energy barriers for CAC are less than those for CC, confirming that Au/Co DSA boosts CO 2 photoreduction. The rate-limiting step for CO 2 to CH 4 conversion on CAC or CC is chemisorption of CO 2 molecules. In CO 2 chemisorption, CC exhibits a highly significant energy barrier of 1.25 eV, Figure 5g, while CAC exhibits a significantly lower energy barrier of 0.48 eV (Figure 5f). This finding evidences boosted CO 2 adsorption by Au/Co DSA and is confirmed via the surface charge distribution following CO 2 adsorption on CC and CAC (Figure 5c,d). More electron transfer occurs between CAC and CO 2 , Figure 5d, compared with that between CC and CO 2 (Figure 5c) because of the ready adsorption/activation of CO 2 by Au/Co DSA. CO 2 chemisorption is however more difficult on CA or CdS. As can be seen in Figure S30 (Supporting Information), trace electron transfer between CO 2 and CdS or CA is apparent. The bond angle (180°) and bond length (1.17 Å) for absorbed CO 2 molecules are not changed, confirming the significantly weaker CO 2 chemisorption on CA or CdS compared with that on CAC, Figure 5d, or CC, Figure 5c. Importantly, these findings accord with the CO 2 TPD findings (Figure 5a). Significantly, the greatest energy barrier of 0.54 eV is exhibited for the step, *CO hydrogenation on CAC, Figure 5f, confirming that CO is the major product on CAC.This pathway was simulated via DFT computation of the corresponding free energy change (ΔG) for each reaction step, Figure 5f,g, on CAC and CC.

        <p>The reversal of electron transfer direction was confirmed when loading Au and Co SA concurrently. Combined state-of-art characterizations and theoretical computation evidenced that the localized electrons around Co and delocalized electrons from Au in DSA catalysts create a polarized region boosting the reduction of CO 2 . This reversed electron transfer direction in Au/Co DSA arises from different electrostatic potentials among Au, Co, and CdS. Consequently, respectively, ≈2800% and 700% greater generation of CO and CH 4 was exhibited on Au/Co DSA loaded Cd. Importantly, Au/Co DSA-loaded CdS exhibited a robust stability of &gt;28 h. Findings aid explanation of photogenerated electron transfer on catalysts at the atomic level and, electron migration mechanism in DSA for design of atomic-level catalysts for solar energy conversion. These will benefit the development of DSAloaded catalysts for the generation of solar fuels.The reversal of electron transfer direction was confirmed when loading Au and Co SA concurrently.
