        <p>The electric vehicle (EV) industry has become the largest social sustainability movement and the most promising industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on oil (Wang et al., 2018b;Zhou et al., 2019). However, a major challenge to the development of a cleaner and sustainable society is the lack of consumer acceptance of EVs (Ullah et al., 2018;Li et al., 2020a). The early development of the EV industry is mainly based on the promotion of the public domain, such as public travel, urban sanitation and government vehicles. As the main battleground for the popularity of EVs, their penetration in the private passenger car market is still low, and the Chinese government wants EVs to succeed in this area (Wang et al., 2018a;Li et al., 2020a).The electric vehicle (EV) industry has become the largest social sustainability movement and the most promising industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and dependence on oil (Wang et al., 2018b;Zhou et al., 2019).

        <p>To encourage the adoption of EVs in the private passenger vehicle sector, China has enacted two important policies since 2012 -"Energy-saving and new energy vehicle industry development plan (2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020)" and "New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021)(2022)(2023)(2024)(2025)(2026)(2027)(2028)(2029)(2030)(2031)(2032)(2033)(2034)(2035)".

        <p>EVs are proliferating at a much slower rate than the government expects (Wang et al., 2018b;Li et al., 2020a). For example, by the first half of 2019, China had 250m cars, of which only 1.37% were EVs. Consumers are caught in a state of "high attitude and cold behavior", i.e. they have a positive attitude towards buying EVs, but the real purchase rate is low, which also puts the country in an awkward pattern of "hot policies and cold markets" (Wang et al., 2018b;Li et al., 2020a). In view of this, further understanding of the social dynamics of EV proliferation from demand side may be central to breaking this stalemate.EVs are proliferating at a much slower rate than the government expects (Wang et al., 2018b;Li et al., 2020a).

        <p>Existing research has also attempted to understand and intervene consumer adoption decisions. These studies fall into two main categories, one to understand consumer influences on EV adoption, such as Wang et al. (2018b), Wu et al. (2019) and Ning et al. (2020); and one to understand the logic of consumer decisions on EV adoption, such as Silvia and Krause (2016), Zhuge et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2020a). In general, two consensus were reached, firstly, the importance of charging facilities for mass EV acceptance is identified; secondly, consumer decisions are the result of a combination of factors, i.e., consumer preferences, policy interventions and social networks, and individual micro-decision making will definitely affect EV diffusion (Eppstein et al., 2011;Ning et al., 2020;Song et al., 2020). However, to the best of our knowledge, conventional wisdom does not fully capture the complex social dynamics of EV adoption, and in particular, the logical role of charging facilities in consumer decision making is still missing.Existing research has also attempted to understand and intervene consumer adoption decisions.

        <p>To this end, this study aims to find effective strategies for the uptake of EVs in the field of private passenger vehicles from the perspective of complex adaptive systems. Understanding the necessary needs of consumers and depicting their decision-making logic are the premise of formulating effective policy interventions.

Many studies have examined the topic of consumer adoption decisions, and these studies can be divided into three categories: consumer preferences, policy interventions, and EV diffusion.</p>
        <p>The first stream investigates consumer preferences. Many empirical studies have provided theoretical support for consumer preferences, i.e., Ning et al. (2020), Li et al. (2020b) and Khan et al. (2020), these studies have examined the vast majority of consumer preferences regarding product attributes and policy interventions, including purchase price, operation cost, driving range, charging time, vehicle security, and related policies, such as purchase subsidy, carbon trading scheme and tradable driving credits. One of the key findings is that public charging facilities are key to supporting the mass acceptance of EVs (Santos and Davies, 2020;Tan and Lin, 2020). However, limited by the research method, i.e., discrete choice model, structural equation model and theory of planned behavior, these studies can only identify consumer car purchase preferences in terms of statistical correlation, but fail to capture the complex dynamics behind consumer decisions. This study contributes to this flow-through design consumer decision by integrating vehicle attributes, policy preferences, and facility impacts into a dynamic decision logic. Based on this, the vehicle preference attributes are presented in Table 1. The second stream examine policy interventions. Policy interventions are also seen as an effective strategic tool to promote the development of EVs, but there is a great deal of uncertainty about the potential impact of such tools (Silvia and Krause, 2016;Sheldon and Dua, 2020). Take government subsidies as an example, Noori and Tatari (2016) indicated that EVs will account for 30% of the U.S. auto market by 2030, with BEVs accounting for the largest share, because of government subsidies. Wang et al. (2019) found that the abolishment of subsidies will reduce China's EV market share by 42%. However, Wang et al. (2018b) and Santos and Davies (2020) found that the impact of government subsidies on consumers' willingness to adopt EVs is not significant and limited. This suggests that the potential effects of policy are uncertain and that the optimal policy mix strategy still lacks sufficient evidence to support it. In light of this, this study contributes to a combination of Pareto efficient strategies, especially in combination with charging facility strategies, while providing more theoretical support for the potential effects of policy interventions that would promote the development of EVs.The first stream investigates consumer preferences.

        <p>The third stream is EV diffusion. preference and network influence. Kim et al. (2020) used a discrete choice model to examine the effect of consumers' asymmetric preferences on their adoption decision, which uses the consumer's existing product as a reference point. For the second model, the consumer strategy choice mechanism under multi-agent interaction is the focus of its attention. Hu et al. (2020b) investigated the dynamic impact of different policies on EV diffusion by designing a complex network evolutionary game model. Li et al. (2019) uses a complex network evolutionary game to study the dynamic effects of government policies on the diffusion of EVs in networks of different sizes. However, in the first two methods, the discrete choice model emphasizes the importance of statistical relationships, and it is difficult to consider the influence of complex networks, while the evolutionary game model focuses more on the choice of game strategies of homogeneous individuals, reducing the complexity of the model. However, consumer decisions require information, not direct learning strategies (Li et al., 2020a). The environmental interaction and heterogeneous individual intelligence decision rules at the core of ABM set it apart from other modeling approaches, which makes it the most promising method for building complex system (Silvia and Krause, 2016;Zhuge et al., 2019). For example, Zhuge et al. (2020) designed an agent-based integrated micro-simulation to analyze the potential influence of cost-related factors on the adoption of EVs. Sun et al. (2019) simulated the dynamic interactions between consumers and manufacturers to examine the impact of public subsidies on EV diffusion. Silvia and Krause (2016) used the ABM model to assess the impact of policy interventions on the proliferation of PHEVs. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing studies do not adequately capture the complex social dynamics of EV proliferation from the demand side, and in particular lack the logical role of charging facilities in consumer decisions. This study contributes to this literature stream by constructing a dynamic interaction between government, manufacturers, and consumers that integrates the effects of public charging facilities, social networks, and consumer preferences. Considering that this study model is a typical complex system model, ABM is also suitable for this study.The third stream is EV diffusion. preference and network influence. Kim et al.

        <p>The purpose of this study is how to promote the electrification of vehicles in the private passenger car segment and achieve the conversion of consumer purchases from conventional vehicles (CVs) to EVs through the "scenario-response" method. Fig. 1 introduces a multi-agent framework that works year by year in programming software such as 
            <rs type="software">ANYLOGIC</rs>. There are three types of agents in the vehicle purchase simulation decision chart. Consumers make purchasing decisions to maximize their utility based on a combination of factors, such as consumer preferences, public charging facilities, social network impacts and policy interventions. Watts and Strogatz (1998) indicated that real-world interpersonal networks are characterized by small-world networks; thus, small-world networks are considered to be the most influential and commonly used networks. This study also uses small-world networks as the basis for consumer interaction networks. Automakers are to adjust production costs and selling prices by using technological learning. Manufacturers' production costs and sales prices will change in response to market demand for EVs, and EVs with changed sales prices will further influence consumers' willingness to buy them. The government agent, acting as a market regulator, specifies the number of subsidies for market-oriented charging facilities, the intensity of subsidies for EVs and the external market environment factors. Noted that public chargers only serve consumers within their service capabilities, and consumers who exceed their charger capabilities will no longer have access to available public charging services, even if they may be close to the charger.

        <p>(1) Information can be passed between individuals because there are social network connections and the social network structure remains constant throughout the diffusion process; (2) No major breakthroughs in EV technology and no major changes in consumer preferences will occur, so the study context remains unchanged throughout the experimental process;(1) Information can be passed between individuals because there are social network connections and the social network structure remains constant throughout the diffusion process; (2) No major breakthroughs in EV technology and no major changes in consumer preferences will occur, so the study context remains unchanged throughout the experimental process;</p>

        <p>In this model, consumers have two important characteristics: heterogeneous preferences and bounded rationality. Because the purpose of this study is how to promote vehicle electrification in the private passenger vehicle segment and achieve the conversion of consumer purchases from CVs to EVs, this study assumes that consumers in the private passenger vehicle segment own at least one vehicle. Following the literatures, i.e., Eppstein et al. (2012), Silvia andKrause (2016) and Li et al. (2020a), this study designs a logical decision flow chart for consumers to describe the heterogeneous preferences of consumers. In addition, according to the fact that individual consumers make decisions by carefully considering all relevant aspects involved in the decision, but it does not matter which aspect is considered first, that is, there is no mandatory order. To this end, five key topics are designed to quantify consumer decisions.In this model, consumers have two important characteristics: heterogeneous preferences and bounded rationality.

        <p>Noted that the model defaults to all consumers as "potential BEV adopters" who are classed as being able to take. Nonetheless, a "potential BEV adopter" does not necessarily imply that he/she will purchase or use a BEV. If individuals have enough motivations, they will make the decision to buy BEVs, otherwise they will choose other models. Questions C-E addresses these motivations. First, are there public chargers around consumer agents to meet their potential charging needs? In this study, the availability of public charging piles is regarded as a prerequisite for consumers' preference for EVs. If so, 2.5% of potential consumers are motivated by a personal desire to be at pioneers (or innovators) in technological advances and will buy BEVs (Rogers et al., 2003). Environmentalists and individuals who value the cutting edge of technology are often seen as niche groups willing to buy EVs, even if this is not "rational" from a purely cost perspective (Silvia and Krause, 2016). For simplicity, 16% of the consumers in the model are willing to buy BEVs, which is consistent with the value set by the Step 1: Constructing multi-product attribute evaluation matrix E from expert group, and use ij e to represent the j attribute value of the i product. In reality, consumers often make purchase decisions based on their ambiguous perceptions.Noted that the model defaults to all consumers as "potential BEV adopters" who are classed as being able to take.

        <p>Consumers do not exist in isolation, and they are often influenced by social networks when making purchase decisions. In reality, consumers are more willing to refer to "word-ofmouth" of products, friend recommendations, and have a certain mentality of conformity (Kim et al., 2011;Ning et al., 2020). In this experiment, the policy hybrid scenario was used to analyze the impact of social networks on the EV diffusion. Fig. 5 shows that as the influence of social networks increases, the rate of EV diffusion (including BEVs and PHEVs) decreases significantly. In words, the market acceptance of EVs is negatively related to the impact of social networks, which are not conductive to the diffusion of EVs.Consumers do not exist in isolation, and they are often influenced by social networks when making purchase decisions.

        <p>Technology learning has reduced the cost of producing cars for EV manufacturers, prompting increased willingness to adopt EVs. It is worth noting that as the cost of producing EVs has decreased, sales of PHEVs have increased even more, despite the significant increase in BEV sales. This suggests that the cost reduction of EVs is not sufficient to drive the conversion of PHEVs to BEVs, but contributes to the reduction of CVs in the market. More non-financial incentives are needed in the process of achieving electrified road vehicles.Technology learning has reduced the cost of producing cars for EV manufacturers, prompting increased willingness to adopt EVs.

        <p>In terms of policy uncertainty, the findings of this paper further support the argument from (Wang et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018b) and agree that the effect of subsidy policies is diminishing. A possible explanation for this might be that the mass still regards the EV as a tool to meet their travel needs, in which meeting charging needs is a basic or must-be attribute and the government subsidy is attractive attribute (Yang et al., 2015). Government subsidy is their attractive attribute, and its impact on consumers is not as great as expected. And about 25% of the Chinese masses cite subsidies as the main factor influencing their purchase of an EV, and while significant, the convenience factor is more important to consumers (Wang et al., 2017). Thus, the existence of government subsidies will improve consumer satisfaction, but if it is not provided, it will not cause consumer dissatisfaction (Yang et al., 2015;Li et al., 2018).In terms of policy uncertainty, the findings of this paper further support the argument from (Wang et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018b) and agree that the effect of subsidy policies is diminishing.

        <p>On the contrary, meeting the charging demand is the basic condition for private passenger car consumers to adopt EVs and they are also more willing to pay more for the use of charging services or charging facilities (Tan and Lin, 2020). If this demand is not met, they will be very dissatisfied and unwilling to use EVs. This also reveals why supporting public charging infrastructure is the key to the mass acceptance of BEVs, while the effect of government subsidies is limited (Neaimeh et al., 2017;Santos and Davies, 2020). To sum up, the influence of high EV subsidies is limited and will not lead to the long-term success of the EV market (Harrison and Thiel, 2017;Song et al., 2020).On the contrary, meeting the charging demand is the basic condition for private passenger car consumers to adopt EVs and they are also more willing to pay more for the use of charging services or charging facilities (Tan and Lin, 2020).

        <p>Of course, this does not mean that the government should abandon the subsidy policy and just subsidize charging facilities. This study shows that mixed policies perform better than single policies. According to Wang et al. (2019), China's phasing out of subsidies led to a 42% drop in EV market share. Such a drastic drop in demand for EVs is bound to be detrimental to the development of the charging facility industry as well, as the two are in a circular cause-and-effect relationship. Given this relationship, perhaps a buffer phase could be added to mitigate the dramatic impact of EV subsidies on the system as a whole, i.e., subsidizing both EVs and charging facilities. However, it seems that the Chinese government prefers to promote EVs before developing charging facilities, with the two being promoted independently and the mutual causal relationship between them being ignored. This is the reason why the reduction of EV subsidies has led to a sharp drop in market share in the short term, and more importantly this is also extremely detrimental to the promotion of the charging facility industry. To this end, a buffer phase may be an effective strategy and this study provides theoretical support for the scientific validity of this strategy.Of course, this does not mean that the government should abandon the subsidy policy and just subsidize charging facilities.

        <p>Although the role of electricity and fuel prices has been identified by many studies, and these two factors are indeed cost factors that influence consumers' vehicle choices, the rational use of these two influencing factors has not been considered in depth, and there is a lack of rational application of this power in real-life applications (Li et al., 2019;Hu et al., 2020a). In China, the service price of charging facilities is not regulated by the government, and fewer charging facilities enterprises have not yet formed a competitive pattern, and the local monopoly is not conducive to reasonable competition in tariff (Zhang et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2020). Therefore, reasonable tariff setting is still a problem that has yet to be solved and directly affects the market acceptance of EVs. In this regard, the government and enterprises should pay attention to the rational setting of electricity prices while also adopting a balanced electricity-oil price policy strategy to provide an external environment for the implementation of a more attractive electricity price strategy.Although the role of electricity and fuel prices has been identified by many studies, and these two factors are indeed cost factors that influence consumers' vehicle choices, the rational use of these two influencing factors has not been considered in depth, and there is a lack of rational application of this power in real-life applications (Li et al., 2019;Hu et al., 2020a).

        <p>In terms of the first point, there may be two reasons for this phenomenon: first, it may be related to barriers to the adoption of BEVs, such as a BEV range limitation that is not relevant for PHEVs (Silvia and Krause, 2016); second, it may be related to China's policy guidance.

        <p>and is an intermediate product to realize the transition from CVs to BEVs. This means that many supportive policies of BEVs also support PHEVs, such as exemption from road tolling or bus lane access, attracting more consumers to adopt PHEVs (Wang et al., 2019). Thus, from the perspective of consumer utility theory, PHEVs have more advantages in comprehensive use and policy benefits than BEVs. However, considering that the PHEV is a transitional product in China, its policy support should be weakened or removed at a later stage. Before a major breakthrough in BEV battery technology, the government should adhere to the strategy of PHEVs as a transitional product, which does not conflict with the travel needs of consumers in the field of private passenger cars and has the opportunity to achieve a lot of potential PHEV purchasing demands. EV enterprises can also take the PHEV market as the service object to obtain more financial support for the breakthrough of BEV technology while developing battery technology.and is an intermediate product to realize the transition from CVs to BEVs.

        <p>The second finding is unexpected and a possible explanation for this might be that consumers still have a relatively negative understanding of EVs, perceive more risks, such as slow charging and inconvenient charging, and do not advise people around them to use EVs (Wang et al., 2018b). In China, consumers' knowledge about EVs is stereotyped and fixed, and till stays in the stereotype of EVs (vehicles + batteries + government policies). Lacking of knowledge about EVs and perceiving high risk of EVs have become a significant psychological obstacle hindering consumers' acceptance of EVs, especially in the current situation of phasing out subsidies (Wang et al., 2018b). Consumers are caught in a state of "high attitude and cold behavior", i.e. they have a positive attitude towards buying electric vehicles, but the real purchase rate is low, which also puts the country in an awkward pattern of "hot policies and cold markets" (Wang et al., 2018b;Li et al., 2020a). This negative effect can be reflected in the market acceptance of both BEVs and PHEVs (see Fig. 5). Therefore, public cognitive bias about EVs still exists (Lin and Wu, 2018). It is necessary for governments to design more activities and more reasonable policies to guide consumers' awareness of EVs and improve the physical use environment of EVs, such as the layout and operation of charging piles.The second finding is unexpected and a possible explanation for this might be that consumers still have a relatively negative understanding of EVs, perceive more risks, such as slow charging and inconvenient charging, and do not advise people around them to use EVs (Wang et al., 2018b).

        <p>Finally, the third finding is also easy to understand. Many studies have shown that high costs are one of the major factors hindering the proliferation of EVs (Junquera et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2018b). However, the cost of EVs is not only related to their R&amp;D investment cost, but also to their production cost. The current EV market in China is only 1.37% of the total market, and most automakers are very focused on investing in R&amp;D for EVs, while neglecting the technological upgrading of the production line itself. The low production demand makes the production cost of EVs more expensive compared to CVs, and the mixed production of CVs and EVs also makes the production technology more complex. Therefore, the improvement of production line technology for EVs is an important practical issue, and the findings of this study suggest that the improvement of production line technology for EVs can help the proliferation of EVs. To this end, the government and manufacturers should pay attention to the improvement of production line technology while actively guiding the generation of consumer demand, such as formulating relevant policies to support, or benchmarking relevant technology companies to promote advanced production technology.Finally, the third finding is also easy to understand.

        <p>After obtaining the model data parameters, all simulation experiments are conducted in ANYLOGIC 8.7.2, including multi-policy scenario simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis experiments. The baseline scenario is used to show the situation of consumer EV choice behavior. In Fig. 3, the average market acceptance of BEVs and PHEVs was run thirty times to obtain. Judging from the overall evolutionary trend of the baseline scenario, the growth trend of PHEVs is much higher than that of BEVs. The whole evolution process is an S-shaped growth curve, which is consistent with the diffusion curve of new product innovation proposed by Rogers et al. (2003). Although the initial proportion of BEVs is four times that of PHEVs, the growth speed of PHEV market acceptance is much higher than that of BEVs. When reaching equilibrium, the market share of EVs is 36.7%, including PHEVs for 25.5% and BEVs for 11.2%. These results indicate that, for the vast majority of consumers in the field of private passenger cars, they prefer to adopt PHEVs rather than BEVs.After obtaining the model data parameters, all simulation experiments are conducted in ANYLOGIC 8.7.2, including multi-policy scenario simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis experiments.
