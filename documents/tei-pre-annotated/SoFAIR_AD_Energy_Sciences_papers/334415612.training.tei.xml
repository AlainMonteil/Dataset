        <p>The interconnection among energy networks is rising because of the high integration of novel facilities such as combined heat and power (CHP) plants, energy storage, renewable energy sources, and gas-fueled generation units [1,2]. The integrated energy networks take advantage of using alternative sources of energy in providing various types of energy loads. Also, it should be mentioned that by optimizing the operation of energy networks separately, optimal operation of the total energy network cannot be ensured because integrated energy carrier is not considered in such optimization. An important aspect of the integration of energy networks includes the integration between power and heat networks as well as power and gas systems. The high penetration of gas-fired units and power-to-gas plant is effective in raising the integration level of gas and power systems. According to the statistics reported in the United States, the usage of gas is one-third of utility-scale in power generation plants in 2018 [3]. On the other hand, the advantages of the CHP plants in terms of economic and environmental aspects are lucrative for industrial, commercial and residential loads by connecting to boilers and district heating networks (DHN) [4,5]. To this end, this study investigates the influence of power to hydrogen conversion ability and hydrogen storage in combined power, gas and heat systems under a risk-based framework. Power to hydrogen (P2H) technology is a promising solution for eliminating the wind power curtailment that is beneficial to conversion of the extra power of wind units to hydrogen, and use it at on-peak hours of power system.

        <p>Recently, the proportion of hydrogen storage and renewable energy resources has been investigated in several studies [20,21]. The prior endeavor in the area of coordinating hydrogen storage and photovoltaic cells has been performed in 1990 [22]. Utsira, Norway is the first location for installing the largest hydrogen-wind, which was performed by Norwegian Norsk Hydro company with the German Enercon company. This system can operate in isolated mode with a 90% availability index [23]. In 2007, another project for the integration of hydrogen storage to wind turbines was accomplished in Nakskov, Denmark [24]. The integration of hydrogen carrier in energy networks has been increased by using power to hydrogen technology, fuel cells, and penetration of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Power to hydrogen (P2H) system employs electrolysis to convert the extra electrical energy of an energy network generated by wind turbines to hydrogen, which is beneficial to the whole network in terms of managing the demand pattern. The stored hydrogen can be utilized by a fuel cell to produce power for satisfying the on-peak system load.Recently, the proportion of hydrogen storage and renewable energy resources has been investigated in several studies [20,21].

        <p>Considering the uncertain nature of some energy systems parameters such as power output of wind turbines, energy market price and load, different methodologies have been proposed in the literature to deal with risk analysis of uncertain parameters in energy networks. In [32], a riskbased stochastic scheme for the scheduling of energy hubs is presented for hubs with wind units, energy market, power and thermal energy storage facilities considering demand response. In this reference, the risk related to uncertain parameters is minimized for the solution of risk-based energy hub operation using downside risk constraints (DRC) approach. Similarly, DRC method is applied in [33] for handling the risk constrained by uncertain parameters in the solution of the electrical energy procurement of large consumers, where an analysis of economic risk is evaluated in line with a stochastic programming.

        <p>High penetration rate of renewable energy sources, gas/coal-fired power production units, cogeneration plants, and energy storage systems to multi-carrier energy networks benefits them economically. In addition, such systems benefit from using alternative options in providing different energy carriers such as hydrogen storage technology, which is effective in obtaining the minimum cost and maximizing the capability of network in satisfying different types of energy carriers. Moreover, handling the optimal operation of energy systems separately cannot confirm the optimal operation of the completely multi-energy system because the interdependency among energy carriers are not considered. As the best knowledge of the authors, the evaluation of power to hydrogen storage as well as risk analysis in multi-carrier energy systems have not been discussed in the literature. So, the main objective of this paper is to study the role of power to hydrogen storage in multi-carrier networks and to evaluate its influence on optimal sets points of energy systems. Also, as the main feeder for power to hydrogen storage is wind power in multi-carrier energy systems, studying the risk associated with wind power uncertainty is of great importance, for which CvaR is implemented in this study.

        <p>Hydrogen storage system and wind uncertainty are not considered in this case. The schedule of the plants considering the limitations of the energy networks is demonstrated in Fig. 3. The CHP unit has been involved in providing the energy of the system throughout the studied time period. The plant G1 contributes to power supply of the system between t=10 h and t=22 h by occurring an increment in the grid's power load and decrement of the wind power generation. The power plant G2 is cooperated in power load supply as the most expensive power plant between t=12 h and t=22 h. While more expensive power plants have been involved in power load supply between t=10 h and t=22 h, the CHP plant has not been used at its maximum capacity (i.e., 220 MW) at such hours for two main reasons. First, as depicted in Fig. 4, the power flow between buses 1 and 4 is at its maximum capacity between t=10 h and t=16 h as well as t=22 h and t=23 h. The second reason is the limitation of the gas flow sent to this generation plant, which increases the power dispatch of the power plant G2, as demonstrated in Fig. 5. As can be seen, between t=17 h and t=20 h, when demand for non-plant load for natural gas has increased, the power generated by the non-gas power plant G2 has increased due to the reduction in CHP power generation capacity, leading to an increase in the system operation cost. The role of heat loss on the heat dispatch of the CHP is shown in Fig. 6, which shows the generated heat by CHP is increased in the presence of heat loss.Hydrogen storage system and wind uncertainty are not considered in this case.

        <p>The impact of considering gas and heat system constraints on the operation cost of the system is shown in Table 1. As can be seen, considering the limits of the gas network and the heat losses of the heating system, the operation cost is $257758.45, which has increased by 1.4% compared to the condition that these limitations had not been considered. The comparison between the wind power dispatch and the available wind power is demonstrated in Fig. 7. The wind power dispatch is less than the available wind power at t=1 h to t=7 h as well as t=12 to t=13 h. The wind power cut-off in this case is 312.523 MWh, due to the congestion of power lines at t=12 h and t=13 h and technical limitations of the CHP plant at t=1 h and t=7 h.

        <p>Here, the influence of the hydrogen storage on the network operation is analyzed without considering the uncertainty of the wind power output. Hourly schedule of the hydrogen storage is depicted in Fig. 8. When high wind power output is available, the storage system operates in power to hydrogen conversion mode that converts extra wind power to hydrogen, thereby increasing the dispatch of wind power. The influence of the presence of hydrogen storage on wind power dispatch is depicted in Fig. 9. The total wind power cut-off has been reduced from 312.523 MWh in the first case to 66.797 MWh in the second one. In addition, as shown in Fig. 10, the CHP plant faces a restricted supply of fuel gas in t=20 h and t=17 h, which increases power dispatch of CHP through conversion of stored hydrogen to gas. The system cost is reduced from $257758 in the first case to $255460 in this case.Here, the influence of the hydrogen storage on the network operation is analyzed without considering the uncertainty of the wind power output.

        <p>In this case, the wind power uncertainty is studied. Monte Carlo methodology is employed to produce 100 scenarios. The forecast error of the wind power relates to a normal distribution function with a standard deviation of 10% and a mean of zero. The SCENRED tool of 
            <rs type="software">GAMS</rs> software is utilized for reducing scenarios number to ten. Table 2 shows the impacts of constraints of gas and heat networks on the expected operation cost without the presence of hydrogen storage system with β=0. Concerning the gas system constraints and the heat losses of the district heating system, the expected operation cost has increased. Under these conditions, the expected wind power curtailment is 313.611 MW. Table 3 also shows the effect of considering hydrogen storage on operation cost and expected wind power curtailment. Considering the hydrogen storage system, the expected operation cost has been reduced to $25,5459. The wind power curtailment has also been reduced to 66.797 MWh, which shows the effect of hydrogen storage technology on increasing wind dispatch. In order to manage the wind power uncertainty under a risk aversion approach, we changed the β coefficient from 0.1 to 0.9. Figure 11 also depicts the impact of changes in β on the operation cost of the combined energy system for a constant value of α=0.9.

        <p>CVaR is the expected operation cost in 10% of scenarios with the highest operating cost. The increase in β increases the operation cost. In fact, higher operation costs occur at a lower risk level, and lower operation cost occurs at a higher risk level. Therefore, the operator of the integrated energy system adopts a more conservative approach with a lower risk level by increasing the β parameter, which will increase the system operation cost.CVaR is the expected operation cost in 10% of scenarios with the highest operating cost.

        <p>Accordingly, the purpose model considered a forecast error for the power output of wind turbines based on normal distribution function. So, the wind power uncertainty is managed under a riskaversion methodology, where the CVaR is the expected cost of the multi-carrier energy system operation in 10% of scenarios with the highest operating cost. The results verify that the increase of Cvar parameter β has a direct relationship with the operation cost. The investigations toward the risk analysis of multi-carrier energy systems operation showed that higher system operation cost happens at a lower risk level, and lower system operation cost happens at a higher risk level.Accordingly, the purpose model considered a forecast error for the power output of wind turbines based on normal distribution function.

        <p>Considering the pressure limits of the gas network, at time intervals when the non-plant gas load was increased, a reduction in the fuel delivered to the CHP plant is observed, resulting in increased system operation cost. On the other hand, considering the losses of the district heating network, the heat generated by the CHP plant increased, which increased the amount of consumed fuel and consequently it increased the system operation cost. The hydrogen storage as an emerging technology has played a significant role in decreasing the operation cost of the energy system and increasing the penetration of wind energy. This storage technology prevented wind power curtailment by converting and storing excess wind power to hydrogen. Additionally, the hydrogen storage technology played a considerable role in improving the power dispatch of the CHP unit through the conversion of stored hydrogen into gas at times when the CHP plant faced limited supply of natural gas, which reduced the operation cost of the combined energy system. In order to manage the uncertainty of wind power, a CVaR-based stochastic approach was used to present a conservative method. The results showed that by increasing the β-operator of the multi-carrier network, a more robust and cost-effective scheduling approach is taken.Considering the pressure limits of the gas network, at time intervals when the non-plant gas load was increased, a reduction in the fuel delivered to the CHP plant is observed, resulting in increased system operation cost.
