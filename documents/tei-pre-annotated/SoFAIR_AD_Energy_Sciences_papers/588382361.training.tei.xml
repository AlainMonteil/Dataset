        <p>The growing development of humanity, associated with continuous industrialization, urbanization, energy demand and the consumption of fossil fuels has led to an increase in environmental pollution, making this one of the main environmental problems of contemporary society. Additionally, it contributes to the generation of sources of infection that harm human health as a consequence of the lack of control and treatment alternatives [1]. The search for alternatives and renewable resources is necessary to avoid greenhouse gas emissions and the contribution to climate change [2e6].The growing development of humanity, associated with continuous industrialization, urbanization, energy demand and the consumption of fossil fuels has led to an increase in environmental pollution, making this one of the main environmental problems of contemporary society.

        <p>Hydrogen is presented as an alternative energy source since it has a clean combustion product and a high calorific value (142 kJ/g). It is important because it does not pollute and does not emit greenhouse gases, unlike methane [7,8]. It can be obtained from organic waste by dark fermentation.Thus, the anaerobic acidogenesis process makes it possible to value a by-product and simultaneously obtain renewable hydrogen [9,10]. This process consists of two stages: the hydrolysis stage of complex organic polymers into simpler organic compounds and the acidogenic stage of transformation of organic compounds into volatile fatty acids (VFA) [11]. H 2 and CO 2 were generated in them [2,12].Hydrogen is presented as an alternative energy source since it has a clean combustion product and a high calorific value (142 kJ/g).

        <p>The dark fermentation of an organic residue may be restricted due to the characteristics of the substrate, such as for example, an imbalance in nutrients or the presence of toxic compounds that inhibit the process. For this reason, the approach to the co-fermentation of several by-products is interesting, which allows complementing the characteristics of the different individual substrates to improve the efficiency in the production of hydrogen. In addition, it allows simultaneously solving the environmental problems of various wastes through their joint recovery, thus contributing to Carbon/nitrogen ratio HBu/HAc butyric acid / acetic acid ratio TAN Total Ammonia Nitrogen FA Free Ammonia improving the environment in general [10]. Other benefits of co-digestion include the possibility of treating a higher load of easily biodegradable organic matter, the dilution of toxic substances, a better buffering capacity of the mixture, higher biogas yield, better quality of a digested product and cost reduction [13e22]. Anaerobic digestion technology allows managing the high amounts of organic by-products such as sludge currently generated in wastewater stations (WWTPs), generating energy as well as a final waste for agronomic purposes.The dark fermentation of an organic residue may be restricted due to the characteristics of the substrate, such as for example, an imbalance in nutrients or the presence of toxic compounds that inhibit the process.

        <p>The sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants is the result of the concentration of the solids they contain. These sludges are liquid, solid or semi-solid by-products generated during the mechanical, biological and chemical purification processes of wastewater. The characteristics of this by-product vary depending on the origin of the water, the type of treatment and the time of year. They contain a large amount of organic matter, microorganisms, nutrients, heavy metals and water [23]. Large amounts of sludge are generated daily, mainly due to legislative requirements in the field of wastewater treatment, increasing the number of treatment plants to ensure compliance with national and international regulations. Therefore, the generation of sludge will tend to grow in the coming years, making it necessary to consider other more efficient ways for its evacuation and treatment.The sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants is the result of the concentration of the solids they contain.

        <p>As a substrate for an acid fermentation process, sewage sludge, by itself, does not have a high performance in the production of hydrogen. Therefore, treatment by cofermentation with other by-products that help to generate hydrogen more efficiently is necessary [6,10,12,24e26]. In the literature you can find examples of co-digestion of sewage sludge with pasture residues proposed by Yang and Wang [10]. or with food waste [27], or rice straw [16]. Anaerobic codigestion tests can also be found using three substrates, for example sewage sludge, poultry and pig manure [14], or sewage sludge with the organic fraction of urban solid waste and grease trap [15].This shows that the productivity of anaerobic digesters can be enhanced and improved by adding easily biodegradable co-substrates [3,28].As a substrate for an acid fermentation process, sewage sludge, by itself, does not have a high performance in the production of hydrogen.

        <p>It has been shown that a suitable substrate for the cofermentation of sludge is wine vinasse, since it have a high content of organic matter that varies according to the raw material used, the efficiency of fermentation and distillation used [12,29]. They have a TCOD that ranges between 20 and 30 g TCOD/L and pH between 3 and 5. In Spain there are numerous industries dedicated to the manufacture of wine, so this alternative would be highly beneficial to manage this byproduct and offer a possible solution in a close way. In fact, numerous studies in this regard show the advantages of sludge: wine vinasse codigestion [12].It has been shown that a suitable substrate for the cofermentation of sludge is wine vinasse, since it have a high content of organic matter that varies according to the raw material used, the efficiency of fermentation and distillation used [12,29].

        <p>On the other hand, in our country, the poultry meat industries continue to grow in volume exponentially every year, generating large amounts of poultry manure, which is a growing problem that must be studied to find efficient management alternatives. Andalusia, together with Catalonia, are the autonomous communities that generate the most poultry meat in Spain, with a production of 50% of the country's total poultry meat. Specifically, the highest growth has been observed for the turkey meat industry [30].On the other hand, in our country, the poultry meat industries continue to grow in volume exponentially every year, generating large amounts of poultry manure, which is a growing problem that must be studied to find efficient management alternatives.

        <p>In this study, the addition of poultry manure to the thermophilic acid co-digestion of sludge and wine vinasse was proposed as an integral solution for these three residues. The digestion of poultry manure residues is difficult on its own due to its high nitrogen content, high values of TCOD and SCOD, of TS and VS, as well as a high pH with values above 9. The addition of poultry manure to co-digestion of sludge and wine vinasse can enhance the hydrogen production of the mixtures due to the high nitrogen content of this residue. This high nitrogen content allows to maintain an adequate C/N ratio for the co-digestion process, balance nutrients, improve bacterial hydrogen productivity and avoid possible inhibition by ammonia [27,31].In this study, the addition of poultry manure to the thermophilic acid co-digestion of sludge and wine vinasse was proposed as an integral solution for these three residues.

        <p>The bio-hydrogen potential (BHP) tests are very practical tools that allow determining the hydrogen generation rate for different substrates under different operating conditions [32e34]. To study the influence of the addition of poultry manure on the production of hydrogen from the co-digestion of sludge and wine vinasse, BHP tests were planned to compare the biodegradability of the different mixtures starting from a mixture of sludge and wine vinasse as well as sludge and wine vinasse mixtures with different proportions of poultry manure. The BHP was programmed at 55 C because the temperature in thermophilic ranges favors the production of hydrogen [35,36].In previous work carried out in the research group, the most suitable type of inoculum for this test has been determined, as well as the viability of different proportions of sludge and wine vinasse mixtures [12,25,37] concluding that the best wine vinasse sludge mixing ratio was 50:50 using a stable thermophilic sludge inoculum in a 50:50 substrate: inoculum ratio.The bio-hydrogen potential (BHP) tests are very practical tools that allow determining the hydrogen generation rate for different substrates under different operating conditions [32e34].

        <p>Initially, the pH was adjusted to 5.5, the optimum value for the development of acidogenic fermentation in BHP tests [6,25,38] and purge the remaining air with nitrogen gas before closing them and placing them in an orbital incubator at 55 C with constant shaking of 40 rpm. High temperatures, in the thermophilic range, have a positive effect on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the process, as well as a greater influence on the elimination of a greater number of pathogens [39].Initially, the pH was adjusted to 5.5, the optimum value for the development of acidogenic fermentation in BHP tests [6,25,38] and purge the remaining air with nitrogen gas before closing them and placing them in an orbital incubator at 55 C with constant shaking of 40 rpm.

        <p>To control the fermentation in the bottles, an initial characterization of the substrates and the inoculum was carried out separately and of the different mixtures of them at the beginning and end of the process, in terms of pH, total solids (TS), solids volatiles (VS), total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), volatile fatty acids (VFA) and C/N ratio. During the development of the BHP tests, the pressure generated inside the cylinders was measured daily to obtain the generated volume of biogas by applying the ideal gas formula. Pressure was measured with an XM 5007 I.S. The biogas composition was also determined by gas chromatography (SHIMADZU GC-2010) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and using a Supelco Carboxen 1010 Plot column.To control the fermentation in the bottles, an initial characterization of the substrates and the inoculum was carried out separately and of the different mixtures of them at the beginning and end of the process, in terms of pH, total solids (TS), solids volatiles (VS), total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), volatile fatty acids (VFA) and C/N ratio.

        <p>Table 1 shows the results of the characterization of the inoculum and the residues used in the tests. It was worth noting the high content of total and volatile solids in poultry manure compared to sludge and wine vinasse, as well as its basic character (pH: 9.72). The wine vinasse and poultry manure contain most of their organic matter in soluble form, expressed as COD, while in the sludge this fraction of TCOD was much lower. It was important to highlight that none of the substrates separately presents an adequate C/N ratio for the development of anaerobic biodegradability tests, which justifies their co-digestion to improve the process, as has been shown in previous studies [12]. The inoculum presents an adequate concentration of volatiles and high values of organic matter that comes from the microorganisms responsible for the purification process and from the intermediate acids of the process. The amount of hydrogen generated by the inoculum in the control bottles (inoculum plus distilled water) was subtracted from the quantities generated at the end of each test.Table 1 shows the results of the characterization of the inoculum and the residues used in the tests.

The poultry manure contributes to the mixtures a high content of organic matter, which implies an increase in the TCOD, SCOD, TS, VS and TAN parameters as the added quantity increases, as can be seen in Table 2. The VFA increase slightly when increasing the amounts of poultry manure. As observed in Table 2, the initial concentrations in the mixtures vary in the range 2332e2852 mgAcH/L. It was also observed that all mixtures present a C/N ratio within the desired range for the anaerobic process [2,43e45].Tables 2 and3 show the results of the physicochemical characterization parameters of the sludge and wine vinasse mixtures in a 50:50 ratio with the different amounts of poultry manure (10, 20 and 30 g/L) at the beginning and end of the assay, respectively.

        <p>As can be seen, the final values of TCOD and SCOD continue to be higher for the tests with higher proportions of poultry manure. Likewise, the TS and VS follow a similar trend, except for the SV20PM mixture, which presents a sharp decrease compared to the rest of the tested mixtures. The pH increased at the end of the process in all mixtures with poultry manure compared to the acid value of the SV mixture.As can be seen, the final values of TCOD and SCOD continue to be higher for the tests with higher proportions of poultry manure.

        <p>Due to the addition of poultry manure, high values of TAN and FA are recorded at the end of the BHP test, which increase as the portion of poultry manure added increases. These compounds tend to accumulate causing toxicity and inhibition of anaerobic digestion, decreasing performance and hydrogen production. The range of FA observed at the end of the BHP oscillates between 1.68 and 2.27 gFA/L, increasing its value coinciding with the increase of poultry manure in the mixture. Authors such as Meng et al., 2018 [46] placed the limit of FA at 1.2 g/L, while Calli et al., 2005 [47] placed the range of inhibition by FA at 1.5e3 g/L.Due to the addition of poultry manure, high values of TAN and FA are recorded at the end of the BHP test, which increase as the portion of poultry manure added increases.

        <p>With respect to the value of TAN, wide ranges of inhibition were found in the literature because the microorganisms can become acclimated and tolerate higher concentrations of TAN. The TAN concentration at the end of the BHP increased to values between 4.23 for the SV mixture up to 6.79 in the SV30PM mixture. This increase in the concentration of TAN [43] described a wider range between 1.7 and 14gTAN/L. It was important to highlight the strong increase in the total VFA at the end of all the tests, particularly in the concentration of butyric acid. This increase in acids was characteristic of the acid fermentation process [51], as well as the low levels of purification.With respect to the value of TAN, wide ranges of inhibition were found in the literature because the microorganisms can become acclimated and tolerate higher concentrations of TAN.

Thus, the SCOD removal percentages were in the range between 5 and 16% removal for all mixtures, the highest value (16.06%) for the SV10PM mixture. On the other hand, the highest purifying yields of TCOD were reached for the SV20PM and SV mixtures, with values close to 24% and 22% respectively. Tena et al. [12] observed TCOD elimination values lower than 24% in all tests. According to Silva et al. [9], these values were typical for the acidogenesis stage of anaerobic digestion during which organic compounds were converted, mainly, into soluble metabolic products such as VFA and alcohols. From Zhou et al. [27] COD removal was 9.3% for the thermophilic acidogenic fermentation process of food waste. Similar values of between 10.7 and 23.0% of COD removal efficiency were observed by Sivagurunathan et al. [52] in the hydrogen fermentation process of microalgae.The low values of the purifying efficacy (expressed in terms of TCOD, SCOD, TS and VS) stand out compared to the high increase in the content of VFA in the medium.

        <p>The elimination of VS was decisive in the analysis of the performance of the hydrogen fermentation process using organic waste [45]. In this study, very low values were observed for the SV and SV10PM mixtures, reaching even negative values. Thus, in previous studies carried out, when the amounts of poultry manure added were very small (in the range 1 and 5 g/L [53], the differences in the purification yields were very low. However, as the amount of poultry manure added increases to 20 g/L, a greater elimination of VS was observed (38% of elimination efficiency), contrasting with the results of the other tests (Table 4). The TS show the same tendency as the VS, with a very small elimination percentage for all the tests except for the SV20PM mixture, which presents 36% elimination. Tena et al. [12] observed similar VS elimination values for mixture SV 50:50 and lower than 30% purifying efficacy.The elimination of VS was decisive in the analysis of the performance of the hydrogen fermentation process using organic waste [45].

        <p>In relation to the total VFA, the increase was quite similar in all the mixtures tested. However, the high percentage of increase in total VFA (48%) for the SV20PM mixture was noteworthy. This increase in total VFA was directly related to the increase in hydrogen production [32].In relation to the total VFA, the increase was quite similar in all the mixtures tested.

        <p>The C/N ratio directly affects the stability of the anaerobic process [2]. It is generally accepted that microorganisms use carbon 25 to 30 times faster than nitrogen. To meet this requirement, a C/N ratio of 20e30 was needed, an optimal value reported by some authors [44,54]. Thus, C/N ratio values lower than 6 units could produce toxicity and damage anaerobic microorganisms due to the low availability of carbon and the high concentration of ammonia (NH 3 ) in the medium [2]. On the contrary, a C/N ratio greater than 30 could cause a low rate of elimination of organic matter and a low production of biogas due to the lack of nutrients [45]. However, in the literature, some authors define as optimal a specific value of 12.8 for the C/N ratio [43], 25 [16] or 33 [42]. In this test, the initial C/N ratio was within the aforementioned values. The SV10PM and SV mixtures were in the 25e30 C/N ratio range, specifically 27.2 and 24.5 respectively (Table 2).The C/N ratio directly affects the stability of the anaerobic process [2].

        <p>Fig. 1 shows the evolutions of acetic, propionic and butyric acids at the beginning and end of each test, for the different mixtures studied. It can be seen how acetic and butyric acids increase considerably at the end of all tests, favoring the production of hydrogen. For its part, propionic acid shows a minimal increase for the SV mixture and increases in all the tests as the concentration of poultry manure increases, although to a lesser extent.Fig. 1 shows the evolutions of acetic, propionic and butyric acids at the beginning and end of each test, for the different mixtures studied.

        <p>The bibliographic data indicated that a large part of the organic matter present in the system was hydrolyzed and transformed into short-chain VFA that will serve as an easily biodegradable substrate [28] for acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea. In addition, hydrogen production was usually accompanied by the formation of VFA during the fermentation process [26,37], being proportional to the final metabolic products. On the one hand, acetic and butyric acids favor hydrogen generation while high concentrations of propionic acid were associated with low hydrogen production [55]. In our case, the predominant acids were acetic and butyric (which account for 68% of the VFA at the end of the tests), which favors the generation of H 2 . The slight observed increase in propionic acid, which according to various authors causes instability in the system and its inhibition [16,56], does not manage to alter the fermentation process in the test studied.The bibliographic data indicated that a large part of the organic matter present in the system was hydrolyzed and transformed into short-chain VFA that will serve as an easily biodegradable substrate [28] for acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea.

        <p>The relationship between butyric acid and acetic acid has been considered as an indicator to evaluate the efficiency of hydrogen production [9]. In relation to the HBu/HAc ratio, all the tests show similar values in the range 0.63 and 0.7 (0.64 for the SV mixture, 0.63 for the SV10PM mixture, 0.64 for SV20PM and 0.7 for the SV30PM mixture). All values were within the optimal ranges marked by Zahedi et al. [2] comprised between the range 0.4e2.1 although slightly outside the range indicated by Angeriz-Campoy et al. [19] between 0.9 and 1.2. The higher the ratio and the higher the concentration of butyric acid, the higher the hydrogen production [57]. For Lee et al. [58], a lower ratio favors the production of hydrogen in tests with mixtures of sewage sludge and food waste. However, this behavior was not observed in our tests, since the SV30pm mixture should have produced a greater volume of hydrogen as it had a higher HBu/HAc ratio. In general, our trials follow the behavior published by Lee et al. [58] according to which the generation of H 2 was not impaired by the HBu/HAc ratio. As can be seen, all the tests improve the amounts of accumulated hydrogen generated by the SV binary mixture (57.4 mL) with maximum values for the SV10PM mixture of 88.7 mL at 12 days of testing. Furthermore, in all tests, hydrogen begins to be produced from the first day of the test, reaching a practically constant volume in the range 58e70 mL of H 2 after 8 days of testing, except for the SV10PM test, which continues to produce hydrogen until reaching 89 mL on day 12 of the test.The relationship between butyric acid and acetic acid has been considered as an indicator to evaluate the efficiency of hydrogen production [9].

        <p>In order to select the most suitable mathematical model to describe the behavior of the acid fermentation process of SV mixtures with different proportions of poultry manure to obtain hydrogen, the experimental results were adjusted to different kinetic models used in the bibliography for this type of experiment: first order, Modified Gompertz and Cone.

        <p>In general, the cumulative hydrogen production potential parameter (P (mL)) was greater than the experimental data in all tests, with the SV10PM mixture presenting the highest value (320.03 mL).

        <p>The modified Gompertz model was the most widely used model to analyze the kinetics of fermentative hydrogen production [59] but it was not always the most accurate when evaluating hydrogen production. This was explained by variations in the properties of the substrates, operating conditions, inoculum used, among other factors, which can significantly influence the precision of the models [10]. In the present study, the maximum hydrogen production rate (Rm) using the modified Gompertz model was very similar in all mixtures, being slightly higher for the SV20PM mixture. Regarding the delay time (l), the value was 0 h for all the mixtures studied. According to Tena et al. [12] hydrogen production begins before 24 h of incubation because the selection and used of a suitable active inoculum from a thermophilic single-stage reactor favors the rapid start of the fermentation process.The modified Gompertz model was the most widely used model to analyze the kinetics of fermentative hydrogen production [59] but it was not always the most accurate when evaluating hydrogen production.

        <p>From the results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that the SV10PM mixture was the most suitable for the generation of hydrogen in dark fermentation processes. Thus, the addition of 10 g/L of poultry manure to the SV mixture improves the hydrogen production potential of the co-digestion, obtaining 88.00 mL H 2 for the SV10PM mixture compared to 57.38 mL H 2 that the SV mixture presents.From the results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that the SV10PM mixture was the most suitable for the generation of hydrogen in dark fermentation processes.

        <p>The purifying efficiencies expressed on the basis of TCOD, SCOD, TS and VS were relatively low for all the mixtures studied (SV10PM, SV20PM and SV30PM) presenting performance values in accordance with the acidogenic fermentation processes.

The highest yields for the SV10PM mixture, with a value of 22.34 mL H 2 / gSCOD added and 27.1 mL H 2 /gVS added , being again the most successful proportion. The SV10PM mixture has a C/N ratio of 27.22 which was more beneficial for the production of hydrogen than the C/N ratios of the rest of the mixtures. The concentration of TAN and FA grew with the increase of added poultry manure.
