        <p>Already in the ninth century, Kanem's empire in Chad discovered the benefits of Arthrospira platensis 1,2 . Nowadays, blue-green algae of the genus Arthrospira, commonly known as Spirulina, are commercially grown all around the world for their nutritional properties 3 . The popularity of Spirulina as a food supplement is mainly due to its high protein content (up to about 70% by dry weight) and its richness in minerals, vitamins and provitamins, phytochemicals, essential amino acids, fibers and pigments 4 . About this latter point, Spirulina contains distinctive natural orange, green and blue pigments, namely carotenoids, chlorophylls and phycocyanins, respectively. Spirulina commercialization has aligned year by year with consumer awareness regarding the importance of natural agents 5 . Obtaining pigments from natural sources is in fact a well-known strategy, due to legislation restrictions in terms of synthetic dyes 6 . Carotenoids are natural lipophilic pigments responsible for the red, yellow, and orange colors found in many living organisms. They are popular as food and feed dyes and flavorings, and in nutritional supplements 5 . Moreover, Spirulina may contain about 2 wt % of chlorophylls, ten times more than in ordinary terrestrial plants and hence accounting for an enhanced photosynthetic conversion efficiency, equal to 8-10%, if compared to land plants, characterized just by 3% conversion efficiency 7 . Chlorophylls derivatives, being heat-, light-, acids-and bases-stable, are potentially applicable in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical fields as additives or colorants 8 . According to many studies, the free radical-scavenging and strong antioxidant activity of Spirulina, are mostly attributable to the bluecolored phycocyanin. The extraction, isolation and purification of phycocyanin have been the focus for many years, resulting in diverse strategies leading to different results 4,[9][10][11][12][13][14] . Many works in the literature have been focusing specifically on phycocyanin extraction from Spirulina biomass 4,9-12,14-18 due to phycocyanin high commercial value 19,20 . The main drawback of these processes is the discard of the remaining added-value pigment content, as carotenoids and chlorophylls, wasted in the biomass residues. In this work, a different approach is proposed, suggesting an extraction chain that only finally leads to phycocyanin. The body of the strategy involves a double-step extraction of carotenoids and chlorophylls using supercritical-CO 2 (scCO 2 ), with minimized modifications on the biomass. The biomass residue, exhausted in terms of lipophilic compounds and chlorophylls, is ready to undergo extraction of phycocyanin. The absence of any heating or destructive step allowed the reuse of the scCO 2 -treated Spirulina biomass for a further Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins extraction step in aqueous media, aiming at obtaining phycocyanin. On the basis of the recent and past literature on the topic, a strategy to yield the blue pigment at high purity was finally developed, keeping an eye on the scalability of the overall process in terms of costs and time savings 9,21,22 .

The heater temperature was set at 80°C, the gas flow rate was 35 (arb) and the spray voltage was 5.50 kV. The monitored mass range was from m/z 50 to 1000. Before sample injection, mass spectrometry parameters were optimized using a standard of beta-carotene (purity &gt; 97%) from Sigma. Then, in order to eliminate the suspended biomass residues, an electrocoagulation method was performed on 50 ml of the prepared suspension by immersing two Al electrodes (3 cm x 3 cm) at a distance of 3 cm inside the liquid. A potential difference of 14 V (0.8 A) was set between electrodes for 2 min by a power supply (Tech Star ® , TPR3005-2D). An ice bath was used to avoid temperature increase.

        <p>High contents of carotenoids (β-carotene, cryptoxanthin, zeaxanthin, among others) were reported for Spirulina, as compared to other natural sources 27 . Their relative percentages may vary with Spirulina growth and environmental conditions, processing, etc.. El-Baky et al. grew Spirulina in the presence of different concentration of nitrogen and varying the ionic strength of the growth medium. These factors were responsible for variations in the relative percentages of carotenoids 28 . scCO 2 has been successfully used for isolation of carotenoids from various fruit and vegetables matrices in the past and more recent literature [29][30][31][32] . This technique is able to provide extracts totally free of organic solvents (avoiding oxygen contact) at relatively low critical temperature and pressure. Since various parameters potentially affect the scCO 2 extraction process, the optimization of the experimental conditions represents a critical step in the development of the method. Based on preliminary experiments (reported in Table S1) and literature data 23,24 , some operational parameters were optimized. 300 bar and 45°C were set as optimized process parameters. Pressures lower than 300 bar were not high enough to yield carotenoids-enriched extracts. Temperature increase from 45°C to 55°C did not allow any significant yield improvement. No organic modifier was added since scCO 2 alone displays a solvating power similar to n-hexane, hence able to dissolve lipophilic compounds such as carotenoids 33 . After the static period, the deep orange extract was collected in a weighted flask in dynamic conditions. The extraction has been performed under supercritical CO 2 and extracts have been analysed as soon as they were obtained, implying that oxygen has never influenced the biomass or the extracts. This is also valid for light and temperature, since extracts have been stored at 4°C in the dark. Fig. 1A shows the picture of the obtained extract: a deep orange viscous extract (in the presence of red, darker spots) was collected after 30 min, corresponding to an extraction yield of around 0.5%. The visible spectrum of carotenoids-enriched extract is displayed in Fig. 2A. By applying the previously mentioned equations (1), ( 2) and (3), C a and C b were approximated to zero, in agreement with the hypothesis that no chlorophylls were extracted under these conditions. The concentration of carotenoids was equal to 3.5 ± 0.2 mg g -1 of dry spirulina biomass.

Although the conventional process has been well investigated, drawbacks like the high extraction temperature and long extraction time, large amount of solvent, low extraction yield, claim the need for alternative techniques.

Some works in the literature employed a co-solvent to enhance the supercritical fluid solvating power towards the molecule 39,40 . Carotenoids-free spirulina biomass underwent scCO 2 extraction with the addition of ethanol as co-solvent, to enhance the extraction yield towards more polar compounds. The experimental parameters such as temperature and pressure, as well as the static and dynamic periods in supercritical conditions, have been kept equal to the scCO 2 carotenoids extraction process. This approach was adopted to shift the target compounds to be extracted from carotenoids to chlorophylls. 10% of ethanol was selected as co-solvent amount. A further increase of the ethanol percentage did not improve the extraction yield, meaning that chlorophylls have been completely extracted by using 10% of cosolvent (Table S1).

Our work is in agreement with their results: they found out the necessity of adding a modifier in order to obtain the desired product. Their comparison experiments demonstrated that scCO 2 extraction with modifier was more efficient than conventional solvent methods. Their results are also in numerical agreement with the present work (their extraction yield was 6.84 mg g -1 ) 39 . Macías-Sánchez et al., recovered only low amount of chlorophylls, if compared to results obtained in this work, due to the absence of any modifier in the extraction process 40 . All the mentioned works already published in the literature were specifically focused on a class of target compounds, such as chlorophylls or carotenoids. Among them, methanol was also suggested as a modifier. However, solvents like methanol, prohibited in industrial processes, have been discarded in this work in the view of potential scale-up applications. Table 1 summarizes the results in terms of carotenoids and chlorophyll a and b content from Sprirulina biomass by supercritical carbon dioxide (first) with and (then) without ethanol as modifier. Results confirm the selectivity of the technique: supercritical CO 2 alone was able to selectively extract carotenoids, while the addition of a co-solvent under the same operational conditions provided exclusively chlorophylls (a and b). By adjusting successive operational parameters, the technique is able to extract one by one valuable compounds from the biomass, without the need for purification steps.

        <p>Starting from a commercial standard product (PC std ), a calibration line was built in order to calculate the phycocyanin content in further extraction solutions. The best fit of experimental data in the plot "A 620 vs PC std concentration" (A 620 is the absorbance at 620 nm and PC std concentration is in µg ml - 1 ) was, as expected, a straight-line, represented by the following mathematical equation: y = 0.0086x -0.0246, resulting in a R 2 equal to 0.999. The slope m and intercept q of the regression line with their respective standard deviations were (0.0086 ± 0.0001) and (-0.025 ± 0.006), respectively. The calculated equation of the regression line was then employed to determine the phycocyanin concentration in sample solutions (see Fig. S10 for experimental data). Fundamental units of phycocyanin protein are α and β subunits, arranged in an (αβ) protomers. These structures, in turn, can be associated in trimers (α β) 3 and hexamers (α β) 6 . For this reason, phycocyanin molecular weight lies between 18kDa 45 (considering single units) and 210kDa 9 (considering the hexamers). By using an average of the most frequently encountered molar mass of phycocyanin equal to 120kDa, the molar extinction coefficient ε was calculated to be equal to 1.0*10 6 cm -1 M -1 at 620 nm, in agreement with the literature 46 . The two-steps scCO 2 process, yielding first carotenoids and then chlorophylls, was able to keep the phycocyanin content of Spirulina biomass unchanged. The grinded powder in fact was deprived from its orange and green pigments, appearing, after scCO 2 , enriched in blue color, mainly due to the removal of chlorophylls, responsible of its typical green aspect. Fig. 4A shows Spirulina powder before and after the scCO 2 extraction step. Spirulina biomass, recovered after scCO 2 was then re-used to extract phycocyanin by aqueous methods. Optimization trials are reported in the Supporting Information section.

For these reasons, turbine stirring for 2 hours in 0.2 M NH 4 Cl of 20 g l -1 biomass dispersion was set as the best extraction strategy.

        <p>After extraction, in order to develop a scalable procedure that could help in removing the great part of suspended solid residue, one of the most cost-effective techniques in algae harvesting was tested: electrocoagulation. In electrocoagulation, flocculation is induced through electrolytic release of metal ions from a sacrificial anode and avoids contaminations of anions. Operating costs of such technique are typically below 0.04 € m 3 47 . The key for this technology is the application of current between a sacrificial anode (in this case aluminum) and an inert cathode (made of aluminum as well as the anode). Aluminum ions are released from the anode, able to neutralize the negative surface charge of the alga. In addition, oxygen and hydrogen bubbles are also produced by the electric current, thus promoting turbulence and helping the flocculation process. Electrocoagulation was indeed effective and the majority of cells fragments could be easily removed simply by filtration on a gauze. Electrocoagulation was not however exhaustive in removing the smallest fraction of particulate residues of the cells walls from the solution. Depending on the specific use of the pigment (for example if the pigment application is related to food printing, where a channeling inside a needle is necessary), a further filtration might be necessary. Notwithstanding the large number of publications in the field of phycocyanin extraction, filtration topic has never been comprehensively faced by the literature. Many works employed ultrafiltration 16,19,48 on lab-scale experiments. This method is however expensive and hence hardly applicable on large scale. Here, the balance between effectiveness, large scale applicability and costs was identified in 12-mesh papers filtration procedure under pressure. Paper filters are in fact the cheapest disposable material in commerce and can be easily replaced when clogged. After filtration, the obtained solution showed a phycocyanin content and purity of, respectively 82 mg g -1 (by dry weight) and A 620 /A 280 =1.2.

        <p>The consecutive steps, performed to achieve high purity phycocyanin, are effective but also time consuming. With this awareness, different levels of purification are proposed in a way that once the purity is enough to satisfy the needs of a specific application, the next steps can be omitted. The next step involved the protein purification by dialysis membrane. Dialysis is not frequently adopted in the literature, however it displays many advantages compared to other purification methods in terms of cost savings 49 . It could be an interesting option to concentrate phycocyanin, while washing out ammonium chloride and other solutes with molecular dimensions below 15 kDa. The dialysis was performed against milli-Q water, to maximize the osmotic pressure and with no addition of other chemicals. From the UV-Vis spectrum, the phycocyanin content and purity resulted in respectively 200 mg PC g -1 (calculated on dry weight) and A 620 /A 280 =1.8. The phycocyanin content was enhanced of more than the double, while increasing by 50% in purity. As further step to improve PC purification, ammonium sulfate precipitation was employed for protein salting-out. The mechanism of salting-out is based on preferential solvation due to exclusion of the salt ions from the layer of water closely associated with the hydration layer of the protein. When a salt is added to the solution, the surface tension of the water increases, enhancing hydrophobic interaction between protein and water. The protein reacts by decreasing its surface area in an attempt to minimize contact with the solvent, resulting in folding and self-association, leading to precipitation 50 .The consecutive steps, performed to achieve high purity phycocyanin, are effective but also time consuming.

The use of supercritical CO 2 is intrinsically a time-saving procedure, since it is more selective compared to traditional extraction methods with organic solvents. Fig. 4B shows the operational scheme summarizing the procedure steps for phycocyanin extraction. The overall diagram leads to a product characterized by phycocyanin content and purity of middle-high grade, as described by Rito-Palomares et al. 19 . In fact, phycocyanin preparations with A 620 /A 280 between 0.7 and 3.9 are considered of reagent grade. The proposed extraction strategy can be hence suitable for larger scale applications. When the purity requirement is specified, the goal of the process design is to obtain maximum recovery at the lowest cost 51 . Depending on the need for purity level of the phycocyanin extract for a specific application, some of the proposed steps might be omitted, with time and energy costs savings. The 12mesh papers filtration is enough to provide a purity of about 1.2, which lies in the reagent grade range as well as the final product that undergoes dialysis and protein salting-out as additional steps.In the first two steps of the process, carotenoids and chlorophylls were extracted in supercritical conditions in 180 min (90 min for carotenoids and 90 min for chlorophylls).

        <p>If the procedure stops after electrocoagulation, a blue water solution of phycocyanin is obtained in 120 min. If the purity needs to be further enhanced by dyalisis, this needs three more days; if the ammonium sulfate precipitation is performed, this added 150 minutes more. The time needed to achieve a satisfying purity extract, strongly depends on the specific application. Talking with numbers, the procedure presented in this work started with 31.4 g of Spirulina powder and provided a blue powder with a phycocyanin content of 7.85 g. The added value of the process presented in this work is first related to the preliminary extraction of orange and green pigments, usually wasted in the discarded biomass. Second, the chosen processes in the phycocyanin extraction were selected setting apart, or at least minimizing, costly steps. Moreover, the overall process, yielding middle grade phycocyanin, lasts only few hours. The cost of phycocyanin is frequently determined by the quality (measured in terms of purity and concentration) which is strongly dependent on the steps used in the process. A minimization of production steps contributes to a reduction in of process costs and an increase in product yield. For instance, electrocoagulation and dialysis are already widely applied in industry and known to be easy-to-perform steps 47,52,53 . The paper filtration is preferable to ultrafiltration and other more echnological methods, in terms of time and costs savings. The commercial price of phycocyanin varies with increasing purity index; phycocyanin with reagent grade, as the one prepared in this work, was reported to cost from US 1 -5$ per mg 11 . Through the strategy proposed here, phycocyanin is obtained without considerable product loss, maintaining a high protein recovery while potentially being able to reduce both processing cost and time. The finally discarded biomass, containing only vegetable residues and salts, has no more any added-value content. Few works in the literature have claimed the development of large-scale methods for phycocyanin extraction from algal biomass. Some authors reported the extraction by osmotic shock, followed by purification by chromatographic techniques 9, 21,22 . Their final products displayed purities around 5. The use of chromatography was discarded in the present work for the sake of robustness, cost-effectiveness and to keep the procedure as easy appliable as possible. As a last mention, Gupta et al. employed chitosan or charcoal for further phycocyanin purification steps 54 . This method was also experimented in the present work. Chitosan and charcoal, although effective for purification procedure, are responsible for the loss of large amounts of phycocyanin, due to adsorption on the material itself.

        <p>The first regulation in the field for dye additives was introduced in 1904 by the United States. Since then, a strict evaluation process of dyes was adopted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 8 . The European Union followed a similar approach through the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The law is very restrictive concerning color additives but it has been favoring the use of natural or "nature identical" colorants 55 . The resulting growing awareness of importance of natural colors, especially in food and cosmetics colorants, accounts for the tendency in food manufacturing to use natural additives. Spirulina and microalgae in general, due to their renowned pigments content, are perfectly able to answer these commercial expectations, with the added value of displaying, in many cases, health-beneficial effects.The first regulation in the field for dye additives was introduced in 1904 by the United States.

        <p>where Q 0 gives the maximum adsorption capacity for forming single layer (in mg g adsorbent -1 ), C e is the adsorbate concentration in solution at equilibrium (in mg l -1 ) and q e indicates the quantity adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium (in mg g adsorbent -1 ). If the plot C e /q e vs C e displays a linear trend, it means that the adsorption process can be described by the Langmuir model. Results on activated carbon displayed a behavior that could be described by Langmuir isotherm. In Fig. 5A experimental results on activated carbon are shown. The Langmuir isotherm linearization for the adsorption of phycocyanin on activated carbon provided a value of maximum adsorbing capacity of Q 0 = 15.8 mg g adsorbent -1 . This could be also visually derived by the plateau reached by experimental data in Fig. 5A (right). Langmuir isotherm in fact considers a monolayer coverage: once a molecule occupies a site, no further adsorption is allowed 57 . Among the experimented cotton-based materials, none of them could be fit by a Langmuir model isotherm for phycocyanin adsorption process. Many practical cases in fact cannot be described the Langmuir model. Freundlich isotherm is empirical and very widely used to describe the adsorption characteristics for the heterogeneous surface. Freundlich equation implies that the energy of adsorption on a homogeneous surface is independent of surface coverage. Its linearized form is described by the following equation:where Q 0 gives the maximum adsorption capacity for forming single layer (in mg g adsorbent -1 ), C e is the adsorbate concentration in solution at equilibrium (in mg l -1 ) and q e indicates the quantity adsorbed on the adsorbent at equilibrium (in mg g adsorbent -1 ).

        <p>where K F is an indicator of adsorption capacity: higher K F , higher the maximum capacity. 1/n is a measure of intensity of adsorption. Higher the 1/n value, more favorable is the adsorption. Generally, n &lt; 1. n and K F are system specific constants. If the plot ln q e vs ln C e displays a linear trend, it means that the adsorption process can be described by the Freundlich model 57 . By calculating the 1/n from the slopes of regression lines, 1.06 and 1.24 values were obtained for phycocyanin adsorption on commercial gauzes and cotton bed linen, respectively. This suggests that adsorption is more favorable on cotton bed linen, as also visible by the more pronounced coloring of bed linen tissues displayed in Fig. 6A if compared to Fig. 6B, relative to commercial gauzes. This might be explained by the presence of polymeric additives in commercial gauzes, hindering the phycocyanin adsorption process. These experiments are meant exclusively as preliminary results to develop potential applications of phycocyanin as a stable dye after some rinsing steps. In fact, all colored tissues underwent three rinsing step in three successive weeks, and the color did not significantly dissolve in water.

        <p> Freezing and thawing: dehydrated spirulina powder was suspended in milli-Q water (20 mg mL -1 ) and stirred for 1 hour. The suspension was frozen and unfrozen two times. 0.5 mL of the suspension was diluted 1:9. After 15 min centrifugation at 5000 rpm, the blue/green supernatant suspension was filtered through 0.45 m nylon syringe filters. Filters retained a green particulate. The resulting light blue solution was analysed by spectrophotometer acquiring the absorbance between 300 and 900 nm wavelengths. In Fig. S5  Prolonged stirring: since the stirring was identified as a key step for PC extraction, dehydrated spirulina powders was suspended in milli-Q water (20 mg mL -1 ) and stirred for a prolonged time: 20 hours. 0.5 mL of the suspension was diluted 1:9. After 15 min centrifugation at 5000 rpm, the blue/green supernatant suspension filtered through 0.45 m nylon syringe filters. Filters retained a green particulate. The resulting light blue solution was analysed by spectrophotometer acquiring the absorbance between 300 and 900 nm wavelengths. In Fig. S6 is displayed the acquired spectrum in the visible region and compared to the ones obtained by stirring and sonication procedures. The resulting spectrum possesses the PC characteristic peak at 620 nm, with a comparable intensity. The other peaks (at wavelengths lower than 500 nm) are now less intense than those ones obtained by sonication, but more intense than those ones obtained just by 1 h stirring. The same peak observed after sonication procedure, at 680 nm, appears in the spectrum after prolonged stirring as a shoulder.  Acidic pH: following some literature methods 1,2 , acidic pH were employed to verify if these could improve the extraction yield. At first, two organic acids were employed: citric acid and ascorbic acid, each one at 0.02 M concentration (pH were 2.38 and 2.86 for citric acid and ascorbic acid solutions, respectively). Then, another solution was employed: ammonium chloride solution at two different concentrations, 0.05 M and 0.2 M (pH were 5.61 and 4.94 for 0.05 M and 0.2 M NH4Cl solutions, respectively). Dehydrated spirulina powder was suspended in the acidic solutions (20 mg mL -1 ), stirred for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm (before centrifugation 0.5 mL of the suspension was diluted 1:9). After centrifugation, when using citric acid, the supernatant was transparent and this solution was not further considered. In the case of ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride solutions, the light blue supernatant was filtered through 0.45 m nylon syringe filters. Filters retained a weak green particulate.
