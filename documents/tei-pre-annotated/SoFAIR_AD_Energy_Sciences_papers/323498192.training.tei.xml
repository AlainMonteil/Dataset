        <p>The inhibitory effects of free ammonia (FA) on microalgae/cyanobacteria in 18 wastewater-treating photobioreactors (PBR) can strongly reduce their treatment efficiency,</p>
        <p>increasing the operational costs and undermining the stability of the system. Although FA-20 promoting conditions (high pH, temperature and ammoniacal nitrogen concentration) are 21 commonly met in outdoor PBRs, photosynthesis inhibition from FA has been scarcely explored</p>
        <p>and is rarely considered in microalgae-bacteria growth models. Two pilot systems and a series 23 of lab-scale monocultures were tested using a photo-respirometry approach, to evaluate the 24 effects of FA (8.5 -136 mg NH 3 L -1 ) on photosynthesis. Two mathematical inhibition models 25 were compared, with the aim of selecting best-fitting equations to describe photo-respirometric 26 experiments. A set of calibrated inhibition parameters was obtained for microalgae and 27 cyanobacteria, growing in monocultures or in mixed algae-bacteria consortia. Cyanobacteria 28 *Revised manuscript Click here to view linked References 2 were more sensitive to FA than green microalgae and mixed phototrophs-bacteria consortia 29 showed a higher resistance compared to monocultures.

Besides these effects, the activity of photosystem I 79 and the dark respiration rates are also negatively affected by FA and ammonia 80 toxicity also seems to be amplified at elevated light intensities, although the 81 mechanisms are not fully understood (Markou et al, 2016). Quantifying the 82 inhibition of photosynthetic activities is of particular interest in algae-based 83 wastewater treatment processes (Abeliovich &amp; Azov, 1976;Kallqvist and 84 Svenson, 2003;Tan et al., 2016;Goto et al., 2019). Indeed, the equilibrium ) concentrations (Anthonisen et al., 89 1976;Collos and Harrison, 2014). The inhibition of photosynthesis due to the 90 presence of FA could be assessed in different ways: by carrying out batch 91 growth experiments (Källqvist and Svenson, 2003;Gutierrez et al., 2016;Bo et 92 al., 2016;Zhao et al., 2019); by measuring the uptake of nutrients or oxygen 93 (Abeliovich and Azov , 1976;Azov and Goldman, 1981;Boussiba et al., 1991; 94 Dai et al., 2008;Segura et al., 2017), or by coupling pulse-amplitude modulation 95 (PAM) with photo-respirometry or with some of the aforementioned techniques 96 (Drath et al., 2008;Markou et al., 2016;Markou and Muylaert, 2016;Li et al., 97 2019;Wang et al., 2019). Despite the relevance of FA inhibition, and the 98 availability of mathematical models to describe this phenomenon (e.g., 99 Andrews, 1968;Han and Levenspiel, 1987, among others), FA inhibition is 100 rarely considered when analysing and modelling the evolution of microalgae-101 bacteria consortia (Shoener et al., 2019). In addition, FA inhibition assays on 102 microalgae-bacteria suspensions are not documented in literature, and almost 103 all experimental works are performed on axenic cultures using synthetic media, 104 apart from a few cases (Hernandèz et al., 2013;Beyl et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>The objectives of this study were to quantify the inhibition of photosynthesis due 106 to FA in different phototrophic organisms, and to identify a mathematical photo- at 8.5, 17, 34 and68 mg NH 3 L -1 , while microalgae were exposed to 242 higher concentrations, i.e. 17, 34, 68 and 136 and mg NH 3 L -1 , due to the higher 1.</p>
        <p>The test protocol was defined by slightly modifying a standardized protocol, 254 adopted for calibrating microalgae-bacteria models and evaluating best 255 equations to describe the effects of environmental conditions (Rossi et al.,256 2018; Rossi et al., 2020a;Rossi et al., 2020b). The protocol included the The concentration of FA was calculated as a function of temperature, pH and of 348 total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) concentration (Anthonisen et al., 1976) 349 (Equation 7):</p>
        <p>Two different inhibition models were chosen to describe the effect of FA on the 355 photosynthesis and respiration: the non-competitive inhibition model (Equation 3568) used to evaluate FA inhibition in anaerobic digestion models (Angelidaki et 357 al., 1993) and a sigmoidal logistic curve, or Hill-type model (Equation 9), used to 358 describe dose-response curves (Prinz et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Where: sOPR NH3 is the gross sOPR calculated in the reactor subject to FA The models were applied to the dataset and different information criteria were 367 calculated, to select for the most appropriate model. In particular, the adjusted 368 R-squared (R ADJ 2 , equation 10) was calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit, 369 and the model resulting in a lower value of the Akaike Information Criterion 370 corrected for small samples (cAIC, equation 11, Hurvich and Tsai, 1991) 417</p>

The total volume of injected solutions (nutrients, 297 inhibitors and acid/base titrants) did not substantially modify the biomass 298 concentration and thus of the light extinction in the respirometer (maximum 299 volume increase: 4%).
