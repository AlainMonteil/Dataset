        <p>Gallium oxide is a wide bandgap n-type semiconductor highly interesting for optoelectronic applications (e.g., power electronics, solar blind UV photodetectors). Besides its most thermodynamically stable monoclinic β phase, Ga2O3 can crystallize in different polymorphs; among them the corundum  and the orthorhombic  phases are the most promising ones. In this review we focus on the main aspects that promote the nucleation and stable growth of these Ga2O3 polymorphs. Particular emphasis is given to the  phase since it is recently gaining increasing attention in the scientific community because of: (i) its higher lattice symmetry with respect to -Ga2O3 which could favour the realization of heterostructures, (ii) the possibility to be grown on cheap sapphire substrates and (iii) its peculiar piezoelectric properties. While the growth of -Ga2O3 is widely studied and understood, a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the chemical and physical aspects that allow for the stabilization of the metastable Ga2O3 phases with different synthesis methods is still missing. Therefore, the present review aims at filling this gap, by analysing the relevant growth parameters for several growth techniques (MOVPE, HVPE, mist-CVD, MBE, and PLD), highlighting similarities and differences, looking for a unified framework to understand the growth and nucleation of different Ga2O3 polymorphs. As a conclusion, we highlight practical guidelines for the deposition of the different Ga2O3 polymorphs with all the discussed thin film growth techniques.Gallium oxide is a wide bandgap n-type semiconductor highly interesting for optoelectronic applications (e.g., power electronics, solar blind UV photodetectors).

        <p>Metal sesquioxides are very interesting semiconducting materials that attracted much attention in the last decade. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) has especially become popular because of its intrinsic properties: very wide bandgap (Eg &gt; 4.5 eV) and high critical breakdown field, estimated to be about 8 MV/cm, higher than the one of other wide bandgap materials like SiC an GaN. 1 This makes gallium oxide a promising candidate for very high power electronics, with field of applications complementary to the ones of SiC and GaN. Additionally, its extra-wide bandgap makes this semiconductor suitable for fabrication of solar-blind detectors for UV-C radiation (wavelength below 280 nm).Metal sesquioxides are very interesting semiconducting materials that attracted much attention in the last decade.

        <p>It must however be mentioned that generically talking about Ga2O3 can be misleading, as this material has five polymorphs of which only one is thermodynamically stable at high temperatures ( phase, monoclinic), while the others are metastable and tend to convert to  upon high-temperature treatments. A first study on polymorphism of Ga2O3 dates back to 1952 2 and reported two novel polymorphs:  cubic, and , hexagonal, in addition to the already known  corundum, and  defected-spinel, phases. In a later crystallographic study, Playford et al. 3 introduced also the  polymorph, which brought the total number of explored polymorphs to six. It is to be noted that the used nomenclature follows the existing one for the more investigated aluminum oxide Al2O3.It must however be mentioned that generically talking about Ga2O3 can be misleading, as this material has five polymorphs of which only one is thermodynamically stable at high temperatures ( phase, monoclinic), while the others are metastable and tend to convert to  upon high-temperature treatments.

        <p>So far, most of the attention was concentrated on the thermodynamically stable -Ga2O3 phase, essentially for one reason: it can be grown both as single crystal and as thin epitaxial layer, thus enabling homoepitaxy and permitting to lower the density of structural defects. Alloys with Al or In can modulate the -Ga2O3 bandgap, 4,5 allowing for the realization of heterostructures and the formation of modulation doped 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the heterojunction, enabling high performance electronics. However, this phase presents also evident drawbacks, essentially due to the highly-asymmetric monoclinic structure. This implies a remarkable anisotropy of thermal conductivity 6 and of optical properties, 7 alongside a relatively mild anisotropy of electrical properties. 8 Furthermore, bulk -Ga2O3 is prone to cleavage and homoepitaxiallygrown epilayers on certain crystal orientations -e.g., (100) 9 -were surprisingly seen to suffer from a high density of twin lamellae, part of which may lead to incoherent twin boundaries with dangling bonds, which may act as acceptors, thus limiting the n-type doping and electron mobility. This problem could be overcome either by growing on 4-6 ° off-oriented (100) substrates, 10 a methodology that proved to be effective but that ultimately makes the homoepitaxy less attractive, or by selecting a different substrate orientation for the homoepitaxy like the (010) 11 or the (001). 12,13 For the above reasons, in the past few years the Ga2O3 research has been extended towards the two phases that present higher symmetry and easier epitaxial conditions than -Ga2O3, namely  and  Their main properties are summarized in Tab. 1. Both polymorphs were obtained by a variety of epitaxial techniques on different hetero-substrates, mostly sapphire, as well as on -Ga2O3. Our research team, including researchers from IMEM-CNR and Dept. of Mathematical, Physical and Computer Sciences of Parma University, has been one of the first worldwide to undertake an extensive research activity on -Ga2O3: we reported for the first time in 2016 on the Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) epitaxial growth of single-phase -type layers on c-oriented sapphire, (0001)-oriented GaN and (111)-oriented cubic SiC. 14 Our interest on  material at that time was mostly motivated by the easier epitaxial deposition conditions, more uniform physical properties and higher crystallographic symmetry with respect to -Ga2O3. Furthermore, we detected unusual properties, such as ferroelectricity, 15 which were also theoretically confirmed by Maccioni and Fiorentini, 16 and Cho and Mishra. 17 Indeed, films of -Ga2O3 are generally deposited at much lower temperature while their spontaneous c-oriented polarization may be exploited for designing and manufacturing novel hybrid devices. This was recently confirmed by Leone et al., who reported on the epitaxial growth of GaN/Ga2O3 and -Ga2O3/GaN heterostructures for novel high electron mobility transistors. 18 -Ga2O3 alloys with In and Al were obtained with mist Chemical Vapor Deposition (mist-CVD) and Pulsed laser Deposition (PLD) 19,20 while a theoretical work 21 demonstrated the possibility to form a 2D electron gas at the -AlGaO3/-Ga2O3 heterointerface with higher carrier density with respect to -Ga2O3 and the effect of spontaneous polarization reversal on the 2D electron gas density in -Ga2O3/-AlGaO3/-Ga2O3 double heterostructures.So far, most of the attention was concentrated on the thermodynamically stable -Ga2O3 phase, essentially for one reason: it can be grown both as single crystal and as thin epitaxial layer, thus enabling homoepitaxy and permitting to lower the density of structural defects.

        <p>Before starting examining the growth conditions of -Ga2O3 it is however necessary to clear an ambiguity that has confused, and to some extent still confuses, the Ga2O3 community: what is exactly the  phase and how does it relate to the orthorhombic  phase? Historically the  phase has been considered to be purely hexagonal. 3,15,26 This is to be ascribed to the used investigation methods, neutron or x-ray diffraction, that owing to their inherent resolution suggested -Ga2O3 to have hexagonal crystal structure with space group P63mc. It was some years later that Cora et al. 27 examined the microstructure of MOVPE-grown -Ga2O3 on (0001) sapphire by high-resolution TEM: they found that the film was indeed "pseudo-hexagonal" as the apparent hexagonal symmetry actually resulted from in-plane 120° rotational nano-domains of orthorhombic Ga2O3 They corrected the space group to Pna21 and, in analogy with Al2O3, suggested this polymorph to be more properly named . More recently these findings were confirmed by Nishinaka et al. 28 In other words, it is possible to obtain phase-pure -Ga2O3 but one has to be aware that it is not single crystalline; rather it is composed of tiny domains of orthorhombic Ga2O3 separated by 120° twins, virtually with no dangling bonds. It is the short-range ordering of the gallium octahedra and tetrahedra included between the oxygen planes that gives rise to such particular arrangement. When studied by x-ray diffraction this structure provides diffraction patterns compatible with an hexagonal structure, but it reveals an orthorhombic structure when investigated with a probe of higher resolution. The scientific community should therefore more correctly speak of "orthorhombic -Ga2O3" or rather "pseudo-hexagonal -Ga2O3", remembering however that the intimate, microscopic structure is actually orthorhombic .Before starting examining the growth conditions of -Ga2O3 it is however necessary to clear an ambiguity that has confused, and to some extent still confuses, the Ga2O3 community: what is exactly the  phase and how does it relate to the orthorhombic  phase?

        <p>The other technologically important Ga2O3 polymorph, , exhibits a bandgap of 5.3 eV, even higher than -Ga2O3 and -Ga2O3. Ternary alloys (AlxGa2-x)O3 could be obtained in a wide range of composition, facilitating band engineering and fabrication of hetero-structured devices. -Ga2O3 shares the same corundum structure of -Al2O3 and it does not exhibit the rotational domains problems typical of -and -Ga2O3. 29 Moreover, the possibility to obtain p-type doped -Ir2O3 and -Rh2O3 permits in principle the realization of p-n corundum-structured heterojunctions on -Al2O3. In terms of applications, photodetectors 30 and metaloxide semiconductor field-effect transistors using an hetero-pn-junction 31 have already been demonstrated.The other technologically important Ga2O3 polymorph, , exhibits a bandgap of 5.3 eV, even higher than -Ga2O3 and -Ga2O3.

        <p>Being less mature and less studied than the  phase some physical properties of the  and  polymorphs are still not precisely known. For example, while the maximum theoretical breakdown field of the -Ga2O3 is estimated to be as high as 8 MV/cm 2 32 , to the best of our knowledge no similar estimates are present for and -Ga2O3. Similarly, for β-Ga2O3 a room temperature electron mobility upper limit is theoretically predicted to be around 300 cm 2 /Vs (Table 1), while no clear estimates on the upper limit of electron mobility are available for both α and ε. Therefore, even if some theoretical works investigated the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the polymorphs, 33,34 we believe that more effort is needed in order to unveil their full potential from both a theoretical and an experimental point of view.Being less mature and less studied than the  phase some physical properties of the  and  polymorphs are still not precisely known.

        <p>We already pointed out in the previous paragraphs the possibilities given by bandgap engineering to modulate the bandgap of Ga2O3 with In and Al, permitting the realization of ternary alloys with bandgap varying ideally between 3.7 (In2O3) 4 and 8.8 (Al2O3) 35 eV. Heterostructures based on these alloys could dramatically expand the possibilities for the design of novel devices. However, while the technology for -Ga2O3 ternary alloys is quite advanced and it was already discussed in several papers and books, 1,36 the literature of -and -Ga2O3 ternary alloys is still quite limited, therefore we believe that an in-depth discussion on this topic would be premature and beyond the scope of this review.We already pointed out in the previous paragraphs the possibilities given by bandgap engineering to modulate the bandgap of Ga2O3 with In and Al, permitting the realization of ternary alloys with bandgap varying ideally between 3.7 (In2O3) 4 and 8.8 (Al2O3) 35 eV.

        <p>The last remark concerns the actual thermal stability of the  and  polymorphs. By combining TEM and xray diffraction with Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Fornari et al. demonstrated that -Ga2O3 initiates a structure modification at about 700°C and fully converts to -Ga2O3 when it is annealed at temperatures above 900 °C. 37 Very recently, Cora et al. performed TEM analysis on -Ga2O3 submitted to thermal treatments at different heating rates and they were able to detect in real time the phase transition. 38 Annealing experiments up to 1000 °C were performed either in situ in vacuum inside the TEM chamber, or ex situ in ambient air. The TEM observations provided a real time view of the atomistic re-arrangement at the basis of κ to β phase transition. Surprisingly, the ex-situ experiments instead demonstrated the formation of an additional -Ga2O3 phase at 820 °C. The different behaviour between in-situ and ex-situ annealing experiments was explained in terms of atmosphere (ambient air or high vacuum) and heating rate. Regarding -Ga2O3, Lee et al. 39 demonstrated that the -Ga2O3 films grown at 470 °C by mist-CVD are stable until 550 °C, but are gradually changed to β-phase after annealing in N2 atmosphere for 60 minutes at temperatures higher than 600 °C.The last remark concerns the actual thermal stability of the  and  polymorphs.

        <p>In this work, by comparing numerous experimental data from different epitaxial methods, we would like to extend the understanding of the nucleation and stable growth of Ga2O3 polymorphs, especially focusing on the synthesis of  and  layers. A thorough assessment of the information published to date allows to identify the critical parameters for the phase selection. For long time it has been indeed puzzling that the growth under similar conditions did result in either  or  films, or that a certain polymorph could be obtained with one growth technique and not with another. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no effort has been made to understand the reason of this behaviour and to critically analyse the literature on -Ga2O3 growth with different techniques. We believe that a deeper understanding of the growth mechanisms of Ga2O3 could help the progress of its different polymorphs and be therefore beneficial to the entire Ga2O3 community.In this work, by comparing numerous experimental data from different epitaxial methods, we would like to extend the understanding of the nucleation and stable growth of Ga2O3 polymorphs, especially focusing on the synthesis of  and  layers.

        <p>In Tab. 2 we collected several papers related to the growth of different Ga2O3 polymorphs by the most common techniques: MOVPE, mist-CVD, Halide Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), and PLD. We included papers in which the growth parameters were explicitly mentioned and discussed, with emphasis towards the gas flows and/or the ratio of the reagents used in the deposition. We also decided to highlight articles in which different Ga2O3 phases were obtained by changing synthesis parameters in different growth runs on the very same growth setup (collected in cells arranged in the same row and with the same background colour). In the table we listed the following parameters: substrate and orientation, reagent types, growth temperature as well as notes for specific cases. For an overview of the above mentioned growth techniques the reader is referred to specific reviews and books, as a detailed description of each growth process is beyond the scope of this work. 1,40,41 Precursors, catalyst elements, growth temperature, growth rates, mismatch between epilayers and substrates (i.e., its termination and/or orientation), and background pressure are the parameters that can control and stabilize the growth of different Ga2O3 phases. In the next sections we will separately analyse and discuss each of them, with the goal of reaching a sound and coherent picture of the growth conditions that allow to stabilize the  or the  Ga2O3 phase. As there are several works, books and reviews specifically focused on the growth of -Ga2O3, we will generally omit the discussion and details about the synthesis of this polymorph, except when the variation of some significant parameters allows to switch from -Ga2O3 to -or -Ga2O3.In Tab. 2 we collected several papers related to the growth of different Ga2O3 polymorphs by the most common techniques: MOVPE, mist-CVD, Halide Vapor Phase Epitaxy (HVPE), Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), and PLD.

        <p>By carefully looking at Tab. 2, it is possible to note that, despite peculiar differences, deposition techniques like MOVPE, HVPE and mist-CVD share some similarities: for example, HCl is used as a precursor in HVPE and is added in mist-CVD feeding solution to dilute GaCl, while in MOVPE it can be used to control the growth rate and to stabilize the orthorhombic phase. 42 Moreover, the temperature range in which either  or  phase can be obtained seems to be consistent for both polymorphs. Physical vapour deposition (PVD) techniques like PLD and MBE generally share similar growth temperatures with the CVD ones for the  phase, while, as it will be later discussed in detail, the stabilization of the  polymorph strictly requires the employment of a catalyst element like In or Sn. 43,44By carefully looking at Tab. 2, it is possible to note that, despite peculiar differences, deposition techniques like MOVPE, HVPE and mist-CVD share some similarities: for example, HCl is used as a precursor in HVPE and is added in mist-CVD feeding solution to dilute GaCl, while in MOVPE it can be used to control the growth rate and to stabilize the orthorhombic phase. 42 Moreover, the temperature range in which either  or  phase can be obtained seems to be consistent for both polymorphs.

        <p>Fig. 1 reports the Ga2O3 phase resulting from different Ga:Cl ratio and growth temperature (Tg) for mist-CVD and MOVPE. The values for mist-CVD are obtained from published reports 45,46,47,48,49,50,51 as well as from private communications with corresponding authors of the cited works. In mist-CVD the Ga:Cl ratio is calculated considering the molar ratio between the Gallium(III) acetylacetonate (Ga(acac)3) and the HCl (37%) used to prepare the feeding solution. The Ga 3+ , Cl-ions and H2O molecules are supposed to be vaporized, transported in the gas phase and able to reach the substrate with the same ratio defined in the solution. 52 Arata et al. 50 GaCl dissolved in deionized H2O was used, resulting in Ga:Cl = 1. For MOVPE, the work of Sun et al. 42 is the only one where HCl is added to the gas phase: in this case the Ga:Cl value results from the ratio between the TEG (triethyl-gallium) and HCl flows, privately communicated by the corresponding author of the paper.Fig. 1 reports the Ga2O3 phase resulting from different Ga:Cl ratio and growth temperature (Tg) for mist-CVD and MOVPE.

        <p>For HVPE it is more difficult to calculate the effective Ga:Cl ratio, because the reacting specie (GaCl or GaCl3) 29 is obtained by flowing HCl on liquid Ga and it is difficult to accurately estimate the yield of this reaction. Nevertheless, we can conceive that Ga:Cl is certainly less than 1: if one supposes that the yield of the reaction was 1, all the HCl would be converted either in GaCl or in GaCl3, with Ga:Cl = 1 or 1/3. If the yield was less than unity, there would still be some HCl present, again leading to Ga:Cl &lt; 1. For this reason, in Fig. 1 only a reasonable range for Ga:Cl in HVPE is indicated in the grey area for comparison with the other techniques.For HVPE it is more difficult to calculate the effective Ga:Cl ratio, because the reacting specie (GaCl or GaCl3) 29 is obtained by flowing HCl on liquid Ga and it is difficult to accurately estimate the yield of this reaction.

        <p>Since it is meaningless to plot arbitrary points from HVPE on Fig. 1, it is necessary to look for an additional parameter to compare some of the HVPE data found in literature. Therefore, Fig. 2 reports the resulting Ga2O3 phase from samples grown by HVPE and MOVPE depending on the O2:HCl flow ratios as a function of the growth temperature. The values were obtained from references 26,42,53,54 and from private communications with their corresponding authors. While finding a trend between the Ga:Cl ratio and temperature is not straightforward, from Fig. 1 it can be noted that for mist-CVD Ga:Cl = 1 is the used condition, although the growth of  polymorph is possible also with lower Ga:Cl ratio. Mist-CVD is also more prone to provide -Ga2O3 at lower temperatures. From Fig. 2 it is also evident that -Ga2O3 is preferentially obtained by HVPE at lower temperatures, with the exception of -phase obtained at 450°C by Son et al. 54 , and that the  phase can be stabilized on sapphire by increasing the O2:HCl ratio both by MOVPE and HVPE at a particular temperature. 42,53 Higher temperatures favour the  phase, as it happens for the mist-CVD. 50 Chlorine seems to play an important role in the stabilization of different Ga2O3 polymorphs. A secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) investigation on different Ga2O3 layers 53 evidenced a higher amount of Cl incorporated in the -phase with respect to the  one (5x10 17 vs 3x10 15 atoms/cc, respectively); this happens despite of a lower O2:HCl ratio employed to grow the -Ga2O3 layer. Interestingly, in this work Cl seems to be confined at the Ga2O3 / sapphire interface for the  phase layer (Fig. 3). However, because of the unknown value of the distribution coefficient of Cl in gallium oxide, it is not straightforward to relate a volumetric SIMS measurement to a surface concentration of Cl atoms, to understand if they may indeed change the surface energy of Al2O3. Density functional theory models predict that at room temperature the saturation surface coverage of HCl on Al2O3 is approximately one adsorbed HCl molecule per five surface Al sites. 55 A deeper understanding of the HCl-Al2O3 surface interaction at higher temperature may be useful to clarify this point. Is should also be noted that the presence of Cl at the outset of growth could be related to the formation of very stable Al-Cl bonds at the Al2O3 (0001) surface with bond dissociation energy Hf = 495 J/mole. This may change both the surface energy of the sapphire and the interfacial energy between the two oxides 53 and it may be one factor -but not the only one -promoting the growth of the metastable  or  phases. Other authors report an incorporation of Cl through the whole layer, with concentration of about 5x10 16 atoms/cc for -Ga2O3 HVPE growth at 470 °C. 54 Oshima et al. 26 found higher hydrogen and chlorine concentration for -Ga2O3 grown on GaN (0001), AlN (0001), and -Ga2O3 (2 ̅ 01) with respect to the one found in -Ga2O3 grown on c-plane sapphire while maintaining the same synthesis conditions and in the same HVPE reactor (2x10 18 vs 7x10 16 atoms/cc for Cl and 1x10 18 vs 4x10 16 atoms/cc for H). In the same work it was observed that also H, resulting from HCl decomposition, is incorporated in the growing layer. As H is known to be a donor in Ga2O3 56,57 this is an important element to take into consideration for its electrical properties when the growth is performed under H-based carrier gases (H2 14 or HCl). It is also worth mentioning that the incorporation of Cl was reported with a concentration of about 10 16 atoms/cc in -Ga2O3 grown by HVPE at 800-1050 °C, 58 indicating a reasonable higher Cl desorption while increasing the deposition temperatures.Since it is meaningless to plot arbitrary points from HVPE on Fig. 1, it is necessary to look for an additional parameter to compare some of the HVPE data found in literature.

        <p>Up to now, no study on the chemical details of the growth of Ga2O3 in the presence of HCl has been published: however, a theoretical study of the MOVPE growth of GaAs with HCl (without oxygen) 59 concluded that the interaction of TEG and HCl results in the formation of a stable GaCl molecule in the gas phase. GaCl can be adsorbed on the growth surface up to a substrate temperature of 900 °C. On the other hand, the already mentioned AlCl termination expected at the sapphire substrate-Ga2O3 layer interface should be more energetically stable.Up to now, no study on the chemical details of the growth of Ga2O3 in the presence of HCl has been published: however, a theoretical study of the MOVPE growth of GaAs with HCl (without oxygen) 59 concluded that the interaction of TEG and HCl results in the formation of a stable GaCl molecule in the gas phase.

        <p>MOVPE growth of -or -Ga2O3 is typically obtained with the use of trimethyl-or triethyl-gallium (TMG, TEG) and water or oxygen as oxidizing agent. By gathering several data on Ga2O3 MOVPE growth from refs. 9,14,42,60,61,62,63,64 , and from the same works but considering the Ga:H2O ratio (Fig. 1), it is possible to plot the relation between the growth temperature and the Ga:H2O or Ga:O2 ratio in the gas phase for the different growth methods (Fig. 4). It should be noted that the MOVPE growth with TEG and O2 at temperatures lower than 575 °C resulted in polycrystalline -Ga2O3 layers. 63 In MOVPE, the choice between TMG or TEG usually reflects a different growth rate and a better accuracy in the gallium supply control, since TEG has a lower partial pressure with respect to TMG, allowing for an easier control of lower gallium flow rates. It also produces lower carbon contamination (due to metalorganic decomposition) via β-hydride elimination rather than by radical mechanism. TEG has lower stability compared to TMG and pyrolyses at significantly lower temperatures, thus allowing to grow higher purity layers at lower growth temperatures compared to TMG. 65 Another consideration should be made regarding the use of H2O or O2: the chemistry of the two precursors is totally different, as discussed by Wagner et al. for the growth of -Ga2O3 between 750 and 850 °C. 9 When pure O2 is employed, the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is substantially increased which in turn lowers their concentration. When H2O is employed, the oxygen partial pressure is considerably lower and oxygen vacancies are expected to form spontaneously. 66 An additional mechanism can also take place: hydrogen may occupy oxygen vacancy sites by forming Ga-H species, thus reducing the surface state density. Therefore, the chemical potential of the surface will be more homogeneous and diffusion of desorbed atoms on the surface will be enhanced. 9 Fig. 5 shows the composition of the growth atmosphere for real 
            <rs type="software">growth</rs> conditions using the FactSage software package, as illustrated by Wagner et al. 9 The main products of the reaction between TMG and pure oxygen are solid Ga2O3, gaseous oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide. If water is used as the oxygen source, H2 is present at high concentration, while O2 molecules are not present at all, because they are fully consumed by organic species. CO2 is also present, but at a concentration several orders of magnitude lower than H2. H2O dissociation and its chemisorption on Ga2O3 surface can significantly influence the nature of the surface sites, which in turn affects the subsequent adsorption and surface mobility of other molecules. On the other hand, defects like oxygen vacancies (VO) can affect the surface chemistry of the Ga2O3 surface. H2O is preferably adsorbed in the form of molecules producing a hydrated Ga2O3 surface, while adsorbed CO2 is activated and results in the formation of carbonate species with a slightly endothermic reaction. 67 In the framework of this reaction the presence of VO on the Ga2O3 surface plays an important role since (i) CO2 tends to occupy them, while (ii) H2O spontaneously dissociates at the oxygen vacancy side.

        <p>Therefore, the choice of the precursor (i.e., H2O or O2) can directly affect the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the deposited Ga2O3 layers. This is an important information, since it has been reported that the VO concentration is related to the performances of -Ga2O3 photodetectors: in particular, reducing the VO concentration enhances the carrier drift and recombination, resulting in higher photodetector response speed and higher photo/dark current ratio. 68,69 If the use of H2O leads to a different density of oxygen vacancy sites 9 for the growth of -Ga2O3, a comparison of the electrical properties of samples grown by mist-CVD and MOVPE with very different H2O content may give some hints in the understanding of the growth mechanisms. On the other hand, the use of O2 or H2O leads to completely different results with MOVPE in a wide temperature range (square symbols in Fig. 4 a-b). In particular, -Ga2O3 grown at temperatures lower than 575 °C with TEG and O2 is polycrystalline, while single crystalline layers are obtained with TMG and O2 only at Tg higher than 600 °C. The  phase is stabilized with the use of H2O in a wide range of temperatures between 600 and 750 °C. Nonetheless, -Ga2O3 can also be grown using H2O at higher Tg by properly tuning the growth conditions, and -Ga2O3 can be obtained at lower temperatures by using O2 instead of H2O. To the best of authors' knowledge, no literature works have been yet focused on the possibility to obtain different VO concentrations in the orthorombic  layers deposited with H2O or O2 and their possible role in photodetector performances.Therefore, the choice of the precursor (i.e., H2O or O2) can directly affect the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the deposited Ga2O3 layers.

        <p>From Fig. 4 (a-b) it is evident that the use of H2O in the gas phase instead of gaseous O2 changes the MOVPE growth process and favours the growth of -Ga2O3. Very significant are the results obtained by Sun et al., 42 (not reported in the graph): using O2 and TEG as reagents they obtained -Ga2O3 at 600 °C, but when 30 sccm of HCl were added to the gas phase, they stabilised -Ga2O3. When HCl flow was further increased up to 60 sccm, layers of  phase was obtained. These results confirm the important role of HCl in the stabilization of different Ga2O3 crystal phases. As the use of H2O instead of O2 in MOVPE definitely promotes the growth of -Ga2O3 over -Ga2O3, one may speculate that hydrogen has also a role in stabilizing the  phase. This does not clash with the results by Sun et al. 42 , on the contrary it would suggest that both H and Cl are active factors in stabilizing the growth of -Ga2O3. At a first glance, since the use of H2O instead of O2 in MOVPE promotes the growth of -Ga2O3 over -Ga2O3, one may speculate that hydrogen has also a role in stabilizing the  phase, alongside HCl as demonstrated by Sun et al. 42 However, since pushing more HCl flow in MOVPE promotes the growth of  phase, it is not clear why the same does not happen with high H2O flow at similar Tg: there have been no works reporting on the MOVPE growth of -Ga2O3 with the use of H2O or O2 without the addition of HCl (that seems to be essential to dissolve GaCl). Nonetheless, -Ga2O3 was obtained at T &gt; 760 °C on sapphire using TMG, N2O as oxidizing agent and adding boron or nitrogen in the lattice (with triethylboron and dimethylhydrazine) to adjust the mismatch; 70 three monolayers of -Ga2O3 were always observed at the interface with sapphire before the growth of -Ga2O3 at 800 °C using TMG and H2O. 60 Sun et al. 42 reported DFT calculations with the relative energy difference for the formation of different polymorphs between pure Ga2O3 and hydrogenated gallium oxide, due to the introduction of H in the gas phase with HCl (Tab. 3). These DFT calculations considered the deposition of Ga2O3 at 600 °C in a MOVPE reactor with O2, TEG and HCl as precursors. From Tab. 3 we notice that without H in the gas phase (reflecting the absence of H in the lattice), the  phase has the lowest formation energy in agreement with the experimental data previously discussed. Therefore, H may act as a catalyst for the stabilization of metastable phases, i.e., modifying the relative energy difference between the β phase and the other polymorphs and allowing, for instance, the deposition of  layers at a Tg of 600 °C. Sun et al. 42 suggested also that further studies regarding kinetic models may be required in order to understand the mechanism behind the crystallization process in presence of HCl in order to: (1) fully understand the growth rate dependence on the HCl flow rates of Ga2O3 with the same phase, (2) consider the oversupply of HCl gas into the chamber to check the phases and growth rate, (3) replace HCl with another gas to conduct similar studies, since increasing HCl flow beyond a threshold results in the crystallization of -Ga2O3.

        <p>In the case of physical vapour deposition techniques (PVD) like PLD and MBE it is not correct to talk about precursors since usually the only elements involved in the deposition process are the ones constituting the deposited layer (excluding the unavoidable presence of impurities), i.e., gallium and oxygen in the case of Ga2O3 growth. PVD heteroepitaxy of Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire substrates mostly results in the formation of (2 ̅ 01)-oriented monoclinic layers with six rotational domains. 71,72,73,74 Nonetheless, a thin (≈ 1 nm) -Ga2O3 interlayer can be usually identified at the substrate/β-Ga2O3 layer interface for both MBE and PLD films. 60 Particularly, for MBE the growth window for (2 ̅ 01) β-Ga2O3 heteroepitaxial layers on c-plane sapphire is limited to relatively low substrate temperatures (Tg ≈ 500-600 °C) and/or high oxygen-to-gallium flux ratios 75 due to the high volatility of the Ga2O suboxide which is formed on the substrate surface as a first step of its peculiar growth kinetics. 76 Outside of this growth window and with the employment of just Ga-and Ofluxes no Ga2O3 layer can be deposited with MBE in either of its polymorphs on c-plane sapphire substrates. Notably, the stabilization of the orthorhombic -polymorph of Ga2O3 with PVD techniques like MBE and PLD specifically requires the introduction of a catalyst element during growth, i.e., In 43 or Sn 44 : the supply of an In-or a Sn-flux together with Ga and the activated oxygen (provided via an oxygen plasma source) helps to widen the narrow deposition window of Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire to both (i) higher deposition temperatures (e.g., Tg = 700 °C) and (ii) lower oxygen-to-metal flux ratios. In particular, the deposition of phase-pure -Ga2O3 layers is limited to growth conditions that do not allow for any β-Ga2O3 formation (Fig. 6). 44 Under these synthesis conditions the catalyzing element is not incorporated in large extent inside the deposited layer. The presence of a (2 ̅ 01) β-Ga2O3 nucleation layer at the c-plane sapphire/ -Ga2O3 interface is usually reported. 43,44,77 As in the case of other growth techniques previously discussed in this article, also the PVD deposited -Ga2O3 layers on c-plane sapphire substrates are characterized by the presence of the same rotational domains giving rise to an (001)-oriented columnar structure. 43,44,70 Fig. 6: comparison of the growth rates as a function of the Ga-flux (expressed as beam equivalent pressure, BEP) during heteroepitaxial growth of Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire substrates with and without the employment on an additional Sn flux (red triangles and black squares respectively) via plasma-assisted MBE. The oxygen flow is kept constant at 0.5 standard cubic centimetre per minute with an oxygen plasma power of 150 W.

PVD heteroepitaxy of Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire substrates mostly results in the formation of (2 ̅ 01)-oriented monoclinic layers with six rotational domains. 71,72,73,74 Nonetheless, a thin (≈ 1 nm) -Ga2O3 interlayer can be usually identified at the substrate/β-Ga2O3 layer interface for both MBE and PLD films. 60 Particularly, for MBE the growth window for (2 ̅ 01) β-Ga2O3 heteroepitaxial layers on c-plane sapphire is limited to relatively low substrate temperatures (Tg ≈ 500-600 °C) and/or high oxygen-to-gallium flux ratios 75 due to the high volatility of the Ga2O suboxide which is formed on the substrate surface as a first step of its peculiar growth kinetics. 76 Outside of this growth window and with the employment of just Ga-and Ofluxes no Ga2O3 layer can be deposited with MBE in either of its polymorphs on c-plane sapphire substrates. Notably, the stabilization of the orthorhombic -polymorph of Ga2O3 with PVD techniques like MBE and PLD specifically requires the introduction of a catalyst element during growth, i.e., In 43 or Sn 44 : the supply of an In-or a Sn-flux together with Ga and the activated oxygen (provided via an oxygen plasma source) helps to widen the narrow deposition window of Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire to both (i) higher deposition temperatures (e.g., Tg = 700 °C) and (ii) lower oxygen-to-metal flux ratios. In particular, the deposition of phase-pure -Ga2O3 layers is limited to growth conditions that do not allow for any β-Ga2O3 formation (Fig. 6). 44 Under these synthesis conditions the catalyzing element is not incorporated in large extent inside the deposited layer. The presence of a (2 ̅ 01) β-Ga2O3 nucleation layer at the c-plane sapphire/ -Ga2O3 interface is usually reported. 43,44,77 As in the case of other growth techniques previously discussed in this article, also the PVD deposited -Ga2O3 layers on c-plane sapphire substrates are characterized by the presence of the same rotational domains giving rise to an (001)-oriented columnar structure. 43,44,70 Fig. 6: comparison of the growth rates as a function of the Ga-flux (expressed as beam equivalent pressure, BEP) during heteroepitaxial growth of Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire substrates with and without the employment on an additional Sn flux (red triangles and black squares respectively) via plasma-assisted MBE.

        <p>That is why it is worth to briefly describe this peculiar growth mechanism based on the collaborative effect of kinetics and thermodynamics, i.e., the metal-exchange catalysis (an extensive growth mechanism description is discussed in Refs. 43,44,78 ). The catalyzing element (i.e., In, Sn) is (i) characterized by a higher oxidation efficiency with respect to Ga and, even though its growth kinetics (i.e., In2O3, SnO2) is based on a similar 2-step process, 75,76 (ii) its volatile suboxide (i.e., In2O, SnO) which is initially formed and adsorbed on the substrate surface has a lower vapor pressure with respect to the Ga2O suboxide. As a matter of fact, both In2O3 and SnO2 can be grown in plasma-assisted MBE at higher temperatures and with relatively lower oxygen-to-metal flux ratios with respect to Ga2O3. 43,76,75 Therefore, due to its kinetic advantage, the adsorbed suboxide of the catalyst element can be further oxidized to its solid oxide form on the substrate surface (i.e., In2O3, SnO2). At this stage of the growth process, Ga is replacing the catalyst element (thermodynamic advantage of Ga over In and Sn) that can be either desorbed or re-utilized in the framework of an installed catalytic cycle. In both cases, under these conditions the catalytic cycle results in a very limited incorporation of the catalyst element inside the deposited Ga2O3 layer. 43,44 This is true even in presence of large catalyst fluxes (e.g., In = 1/3 of the Ga-flux). 43 In other words, in metal-exchange catalysis the catalyst element works as an oxygen getter/reservoir for the Ga2O3 growth efficiently expanding its deposition window. -Ga2O3 layers in presence of the catalysing element Sn were also reported for PLD grown thin films on MgO (111), SrTiO3 (111), and Yttria-stabilized ZrO2 (111) substrates. 70,79 Notably, MBE In-mediated metalexchange catalysis has been also applied to widen the growth window of Ga2O3 layers deposited on all the available β-Ga2O3 bulk substrate orientations [i.e., (010), ( 100), (001), and (2 ̅ 01)] 12, 13, 80 but differently from the discussed heteroepitaxial growths, in this case the deposited layers always preserved the monoclinic structure of the substrate.That is why it is worth to briefly describe this peculiar growth mechanism based on the collaborative effect of kinetics and thermodynamics, i.e., the metal-exchange catalysis (an extensive growth mechanism description is discussed in Refs. 43,44,78 ).

        <p>From Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 it is evident that the growth temperature Tg plays a critical role in tailoring the crystal phases of Ga2O3. In particular for CVD growths, high temperatures are usually necessary for the crystallization of the thermodynamically stable -Ga2O3 polymorph (regardless of the deposition techniques, precursors, and gas phase composition). However, the monoclinic phase has been already reviewed in depth in the literature 1,40 and, therefore, we will not include a discussion on  in this review. Generally, at Tg between 400 and 700 °C the driving force for the crystallization of one particular phase can be found in the kinetic of the reactions and/or in the growth process itself; for example, by simply changing the precursor from H2O to O2 the Ga2O3 switches from  to  (see paragraph 2.1).From Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 it is evident that the growth temperature Tg plays a critical role in tailoring the crystal phases of Ga2O3.

        <p>The growth temperature is a key factor in controlling  or  phase stabilization by mist-CVD growth; in particular, Tg ≤ 500 °C favours the deposition of -Ga2O3 layers, while higher temperatures (up to Tg &lt; 700 °C) result in the synthesis of -Ga2O3 films (Fig. 1).The growth temperature is a key factor in controlling  or  phase stabilization by mist-CVD growth; in particular, Tg ≤ 500 °C favours the deposition of -Ga2O3 layers, while higher temperatures (up to Tg &lt; 700 °C) result in the synthesis of -Ga2O3 films (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>With HVPE (Fig. 2) it is generally easier to crystallize the  phase in a wider temperature range compared to the mist-CVD one. -Ga2O3 could be obtained by HVPE at similar temperatures to mist-CVD (Tg = 650 °C) by appropriately tuning the gas phase composition, with the exception of one article 54 that reports the nucleation of an -Ga2O3 layer at a Tg of 450 °C.With HVPE (Fig. 2) it is generally easier to crystallize the  phase in a wider temperature range compared to the mist-CVD one. -Ga2O3 could be obtained by HVPE at similar temperatures to mist-CVD (Tg = 650 °C) by appropriately tuning the gas phase composition, with the exception of one article 54 that reports the nucleation of an -Ga2O3 layer at a Tg of 450 °C.</p>
        <p>Another interesting observation (Fig. 4) is that -Ga2O3 is obtained by mist-CVD in a temperature range (400-550 °C) lower than the one typically used in MOVPE; one hypothesis may be related to the different kinetics of the reactions, due to the different precursors used. While in mist-CVD Ga 3+ ions should be directly present in the gas phase so that no precursor decomposition has to occur, in MOVPE processes TMG (or TEG) may not have sufficient energy to form Ga2O3, and may tend to react directly with H2O in the vapour phase without leading to Ga2O3 crystallization. Low MOVPE deposition temperatures (550 °C) result in polycrystalline Ga2O3 using H2O and TMG. In this framework, it is worth noting that by using an ALD process instead of a standard MOVPE growth regime, crystalline -Ga2O3 could be obtained also at 550 °C: 14 while the decomposition of gallium precursor may have an important role in the growth process, the parasite reactions in the gas phase between metal-organic precursor and water may also play a role at lower temperatures. The use of water and TEG instead of TMG could be a possible route to obtain -Ga2O3 by MOVPE at Tg comparable with mist-CVD without the use of Cl, as TEG has a lower decomposition temperature and prevents pre-reactions between Ga and water. 65 However, Chen et al. 64 reported the deposition of an -Ga2O3 layer at 500 °C by using O2 and TEG at 35 mbar. For this reason, it seems that the use of a particular Ga precursor is not sufficient to explain why mist-CVD at lower temperatures results in -Ga2O3; other factors, such as the amount of H2O (or H) or the growth pressure may also play a role in this process. A possible explanation may be that, by changing the growth temperature, the relative energy differences between the phases reported in presence of H (Errore. L'origine riferimento non è stata trovata.) may assume different values, with the  phase more favoured than the  one.

        <p>In the case of PVD deposition techniques, both PLD and MBE independently showed that the stabilization of the  phase over the β one is associated to the employment of higher growth temperatures (Tg ≥ 465 °C in PLD - 73 -and Tg = 550 -700 °C in MBE - 43,44 ) during the In/Sn-mediated deposition process.

        <p>HVPE, MOVPE and mist-CVD all allow for comparable Ga2O3 growth rates of about 500-1000 nm/h. Nonetheless, HVPE can also reach growth rates of about 10 m/h by increasing the flow rates. 53 If comparable synthesis parameters and similar growth rates are considered, the stabilization of different Ga2O3 polymorphs should be discussed in light of the chemical reactions triggered by the different employed precursors (paragraph 2.1).HVPE, MOVPE and mist-CVD all allow for comparable Ga2O3 growth rates of about 500-1000 nm/h.

        <p>Generally, the growth rate can be related to the available time for lattice arrangement during Ga2O3 nucleation. In particular, a faster growth rate, typical of HVPE, may not allow the adatoms to rearrange on the layer/substrate surface, therefore not permitting the formation of the thermodynamically stable β-phase. In the case of the heteroepitaxial growth on c-plane sapphire, the diffusing adatoms initially bonded to the oxygen and aluminium sites of the (0001) substrate surface are preferably ordering as -Ga2O3 and are unable to undergo rearrangement to the β-Ga2O3 or -Ga2O3 phase before the next impinging atoms are adsorbed on the previously formed corundum surface: each layer of -Ga2O3 is then constrained or buried by the rapidly depositing subsequent layers. 53 In this situation also the substrate crystallography, the eventual presence of a nucleation layer, and therefore the resulting lattice mismatch play an important role in the stabilization of the Ga2O3 phase (see paragraph 2.4).Generally, the growth rate can be related to the available time for lattice arrangement during Ga2O3 nucleation.

        <p>The role of the growth rate in stabilizing the Ga2O3 phase is evidenced also by comparing the works of Dang et al. and Kim et al., 45,84 where mist-CVD growths at the same Tg of 400 °C result in the stabilization of different Ga2O3 phases as a function of different growth rates. In particular, a higher growth rate of about 860 nm/h resulted in the deposition of a phase-pure -Ga2O3 layer, 45 while a lower growth rate of 260 nm/h ended up in the synthesis of a mixed  and  phase sample as observed by bandgap measurements. 84 This supports the idea that the time given to the adatoms to rearrange on the layer surface, i.e., before the atoms necessary to cover the next monolayer are adsorbed, may influence the stabilization of a particular phase.The role of the growth rate in stabilizing the Ga2O3 phase is evidenced also by comparing the works of Dang et al. and Kim et al., 45,84 where mist-CVD growths at the same Tg of 400 °C result in the stabilization of different Ga2O3 phases as a function of different growth rates.

        <p>A similar picture can be also valid for MBE growths, since the deposition of -Ga2O3 layers is associated to a higher growth rate with respect to the β ones (Figure 6) under similar synthesis conditions (i.e., Tg ≈ 700 °C and low oxygen-to-metal flux ratio). 43,44 Usually the full incorporation of the impinging Ga-flux can be obtained in such regime, with maximum growth rates in the range of 100 to 300 nm/h. Nonetheless, it should be considered that the peculiar growth process associated to the stabilization of the -phase (metal exchange catalysis) specifically requires the employment of synthesis conditions where Ga2O3 would hardly grow without catalyst (see paragraph 2.1). In fact, similar growth rates, characterized by a full Ga-flux incorporation, could be obtained at lower growth temperatures and high O-flows in the case of β-Ga2O3 layers.A similar picture can be also valid for MBE growths, since the deposition of -Ga2O3 layers is associated to a higher growth rate with respect to the β ones (Figure 6) under similar synthesis conditions (i.e., Tg ≈ 700 °C and low oxygen-to-metal flux ratio). 43,44 Usually the full incorporation of the impinging Ga-flux can be obtained in such regime, with maximum growth rates in the range of 100 to 300 nm/h.

        <p>Some authors have reported that the substrates of a cubic material (MgO, YSZ) oriented along the (111) direction allow to obtain single phase (001)-oriented -Ga2O3 layers by mist-CVD in a wide range of deposition temperatures (400-700 °C) where typically -Ga2O3 is obtained on c-plane sapphire. 86,87 On the other hand, the growth on c-sapphire proved to be more difficult, as mixed phases are obtained in standard growth conditions by Mist-CVD, either - at low temperatures or -β at high temperatures, due to the crystal structure of -Al2O3. It is noteworthy that the addition of a small buffer layer of NiO (111) on the sapphire substrate permits to switch from -Ga2O3 to -Ga2O3 growth in the whole 400-800 °C range. 50 A lower mismatch between the substrate and the -Ga2O3 epilayer also appears to facilitate the growth of this phase: with the same HVPE growth conditions that resulted in -Ga2O3 layers on c-plane sapphire substrates, (001)-oriented -Ga2O3 was obtained on GaN (0001), AlN (0001), β-Ga2O3 (2 ̅ 01), the latter exhibiting a superior crystal quality. 29,88,89,90 A similar trend has been reported for Mist-CVD growth, where the use of MgO(111) instead of YSZ(111) substrates (with 2.5 and 20 % nominal mismatch with -Ga2O3, respectively) allowed to obtain single-phase (001)-oriented  layers at much lower temperatures. 86 However, a quantitative comparison of literature results based on the reported mismatch could be misleading, as the nominal lattice constant of the substrate might not be the parameter determining the effective mismatch. Furthermore, one should consider the thermal mismatch, that leads to different lattice parameters for substrate and epilayer at different temperatures. Indeed, as discussed in the introduction, epitaxial (001) -Ga2O3 grows by the formation of rotational domains, effectively altering the difference in lattice spacing between epilayer and substrate. The most obvious example is the case of c-plane sapphire, where the nominal mismatch between -Al2O3 and (001) -Ga2O3 is 65 %, but, by effect of 120° lattice rotations the real mismatch is 4.8 %. 15 In this regard, it is interesting to mention that in spite of various tested substrates (and different crystal orientations), so far just (001)-oriented -Ga2O3 layers were reported in literature. As mentioned, when proper structural characterization is given, all these samples are reported to be characterized by the presence of rotational domains resulting in a columnar-like growth. Even if no dangling bonds are expected at the walls of the  domains (differently from the case of rotational domains in β layers), 91 it should be considered that their presence could result in a barrier for in-plane electronic conduction. There can be two effective strategies for growing pure -Ga2O3 single crystal layers, i.e., free of rotational domains: first, finding a properly matched substrate so to allow the accommodation of the orthorhombic structure of Ga2O3 in different crystal orientations [e.g., (010)] or, second, employing a proper in-plane substrate offcut, i.e., inducing the formation of properly spaced terraces whose kinks act as properly spaced nucleation sites (as already demonstrated for the growth of β layers on c-plane sapphire). 92 As it was discussed in the previous section, heteroepitaxy of -Ga2O3 and -Ga2O3 on sapphire may be favoured over the growth of β-Ga2O3 at lower temperatures due to reduced kinetical effects, allowing for the growth of a phase that is better lattice-matched to the substrate. In MOVPE, the growth on -Al2O3 oriented along (1120), (1010), (0112) allows for the growth of -Ga2O3 70 at 700 °C using TEG and NO2 as oxidizing reagent.Some authors have reported that the substrates of a cubic material (MgO, YSZ) oriented along the (111) direction allow to obtain single phase (001)-oriented -Ga2O3 layers by mist-CVD in a wide range of deposition temperatures (400-700 °C) where typically -Ga2O3 is obtained on c-plane sapphire. 86,87 On the other hand, the growth on c-sapphire proved to be more difficult, as mixed phases are obtained in standard growth conditions by Mist-CVD, either - at low temperatures or -β at high temperatures, due to the crystal structure of -Al2O3.

        <p>-Ga2O3 was obtained by mist-CVD on an -(Al0.4Ga0.6)2O3 buffer at temperatures lower than 600 °C, while the  phase was observed at higher temperatures, conceivably due to the lower lattice mismatch of 1.2 % for the  phase and 2.2 % for the  phase. This effect was interpreted as due to a stepped surface: if the diffusion of adatoms is sufficiently high to reach step edges, the epitaxial layer grows with the  crystal structure of the buffer; if the growth temperature is not high enough, the lower-mismatch -Ga2O3 is favoured. 48 Therefore, not only the substrate and its intrinsic mismatch with the relative polymorph lattice of the growing Ga2O3 layer should be considered as a growth parameter, but also its in-plane offcut and the associated terrace length. In this regard, the possible role of anisotropic diffusion lengths of the adsorbed species along different in-plane directions should also be considered, meaning that also the in-plane direction of the substrate offcut should be taken into account (i.e., both terrace length and diffusion length along the offcut direction determine if the adsorbed species are capable to reach the step edges and thus allow a stepflow growth mechanism), as already evidenced for β-Ga2O3. 93 The indication that the  phase stabilization could be mainly driven by the mismatch with the underlying substrate lattice is also suggested by the MBE literature. In particular, corundum gallium oxide shares the same crystalline structure of sapphire and, therefore, it can in principle allow the growth of -Ga2O3 along different sapphire orientations. In this case, the substrate-layer mismatch affects the maximum thickness that can be obtained: for c-plane sapphire (4.6 % mismatch) only about a nanometer of -Ga2O3 is achievable, while for a-plane sapphire layers of up to 10 nm were grown (3.4 % mismatch). 81 Nonetheless, the deposition of a Nd-doped -Ga2O3 layer as thick as 100 nm has also been reported, 83 suggesting that the presence of a could affect the critical thickness of the layer on this orientation. Nonetheless, the thickest -Ga2O3 films were obtained on r-plane sapphire: 82 in this case a phase change to β-Ga2O3 was recorded after about 200 nm of -Ga2O3, due to the formation of large exposed c-facets which favour the subsequent monoclinic phase nucleation. Being the formation of facets also related to the chemical potential during the thin film deposition, 94 we can argue that in the case of -Ga2O3 layers on r-plane sapphire substrates the thickness limitation for the obtainment of phase-pure layers could be overcome by properly tuning the Ga-to-O flux ratio.-Ga2O3 was obtained by mist-CVD on an -(Al0.4Ga0.6)2O3 buffer at temperatures lower than 600 °C, while the  phase was observed at higher temperatures, conceivably due to the lower lattice mismatch of 1.2 % for the  phase and 2.2 % for the  phase.

        <p>However, in the case of -Ga2O3 layers obtained via PVD techniques like MBE and PLD, the role of the substrate and the relative mismatch with the layer is less clear: there have been reports of layers grown on c-plane sapphire via MBE 43,44 and PLD, 73 while the growth on substrates with a cubic structure [MgO (111), SrTiO3 (111), and YSZ (111)] has been just reported for PLD. 79 A buffer layer of β-Ga2O3 between c-sapphire and -Ga2O3 is usually present and evidenced by XRD and TEM. This could be an indication that an interlayer could be needed in order to accommodate the substrate-layer strain. The presence of β-Ga2O3 buffer layer was observed also in the recent reports of -Ga2O3 layers on ITO/YSZ (111) 87 and of van der Waals epitaxy of -Ga2O3 on synthetic mica 95 both via mist-CVD. In particular, the Van der Waals epitaxy report of -Ga2O3 might hint to the fact that, in conditions with very weak chemical bonding between substrate and epilayer, the growth of an initial layer of the most thermodynamically stable material in the β phase is needed, before obtaining epitaxial -Ga2O3. Moreover, the presence of an -Ga2O3 buffer layer prior to -Ga2O3 deposition on c-plane sapphire has been reported for HVPE with the presence of Cl and interpreted to be related to a semi-coherent growth of the -phase, followed by -phase island nucleation and growth. 53 Nonetheless, for both MBE and PLD where -Ga2O3 can be just obtained by In or Sn-mediated catalysed growth (see 2.1), also the crystal structure of the respective catalyst oxides (In2O3 or SnO2) -i.e., their oxygen atoms distribution/coordination on the sample surface -could be at least partially responsible for the orthorhombic phase stabilization. Moreover, It is worth mentioning that In-mediated MBE growth on (2 ̅ 01) β-Ga2O3 single crystalline substrates under growth conditions that would otherwise allow for the synthesis of  layers on c-plane sapphire substrates, results in the preservation of the underlying substrate monoclinic structure. 12,13 This is surprising considering that (i) the growth of -Ga2O3 on c-plane sapphire substrates is usually happening on top of (2 ̅ 01) β-Ga2O3 interlayers, and that (ii) the deposition of -Ga2O3 layers has been already previously reported on top of β-Ga2O3 bulk substrates via HVPE. 26 One possible explanation relies on the formation of wide facets [i.e., different surfaces not parallel to the (2 ̅ 01) one] during MBE (2 ̅ 01) -homoepitaxy, 12,13 that could favour the stabilization of the monoclinic polymorph, similarly to what has been previously discussed in the case of -Ga2O3 on r-plane sapphire substrates. 82 An interesting contribution about the role of substrate on the nucleation of  or  phase is given in Refs. 90,96 , using HVPE to grow Ga2O3 on column-patterned sapphire. While the standard deposition on bare c-plane sapphire results in -Ga2O3 with good crystallinity, the film on patterned substrates gives a mixture of  and -Ga2O3, with -Ga2O3 vertical columns originating from the cones on sapphire substrate, protruding up to the surface and capped with an irregular shaped faceted pyramid on top. The -phase was located between these columns and had poorer crystallinity.However, in the case of -Ga2O3 layers obtained via PVD techniques like MBE and PLD, the role of the substrate and the relative mismatch with the layer is less clear: there have been reports of layers grown on c-plane sapphire via MBE 43,44 and PLD, 73 while the growth on substrates with a cubic structure [MgO (111), SrTiO3 (111), and YSZ (111)] has been just reported for PLD. 79 A buffer layer of β-Ga2O3 between c-sapphire and -Ga2O3 is usually present and evidenced by XRD and TEM.

        <p>Considering different deposition techniques that work in totally different pressure regimes (CVD vs PVD) and with different oxidizing agents, a unified view towards the effect of pressure on the stabilization of Ga2O3 polymorphs is challenging.

        <p>As a starting point, a simple consideration would be that MOVPE processes are usually performed at pressures from some tens up to some hundreds of mbar, while mist-CVD and HVPE generally use atmospheric pressure. As discussed above, by considering Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 it can be noticed that -Ga2O3 is obtained by both HVPE and mist-CVD at low temperatures (up to 500-600 °C), while  or  Ga2O3 are generally obtained in the same temperature range by MOVPE.As a starting point, a simple consideration would be that MOVPE processes are usually performed at pressures from some tens up to some hundreds of mbar, while mist-CVD and HVPE generally use atmospheric pressure.

        <p>Regarding MOVPE with H2 and TEG, it was observed that a high pressure regime (&gt;100 mbar) favours the nucleation of -Ga2O3 in the gas phase resulting in films with a mosaic surface, while -Ga2O3 is obtained at lower pressures, as already discussed in paragraph 2.3. 64 For PLD, a flux of molecular oxygen is employed for the growth of oxide layers; for Sn-mediated growth of Ga2O3 it has been showed that the stabilization of the  phase over the β one is requiring lower oxygen fluxes (pO2 ≤ 1x10 -2 mbar). 79 For MBE growth it is complicated to discuss about absolute oxygen partial pressure values; in fact, as this deposition technique must work at significantly lower pressure regimes during deposition processes (≤ 10 -5 mbar), it therefore requires a flow of highly reactive oxygen so to allow for oxide layer depositions. This can be obtained either by an O-plasma source or by ozone, whose efficiencies are strongly dependent on every single experimental apparatus (e.g., of the sources from the substrate, purity of the provided ozone flux, efficiency of the O-plasma source). As already mentioned in 2.1, and consistently with the discussed PLD data, the stabilization via MBE of the  phase over the β one is requiring lower oxygen-to-metal flux ratios. 44 In both PLD and MBE, growing phase-pure -layers through metalexchange catalysis (see paragraph 2.1) not only requires the presence of the catalyst element during growth, but also the employment of synthesis conditions that would not otherwise allow for β-Ga2O3 deposition (i.e., substrate temperatures &gt; 550 °C coupled with low oxygen fluxes). Otherwise, the competition between the normal growth regime (i.e., without catalyst) and the catalysed one would result in a mixed β- phase formation (see Fig. 6). 44 Moreover, higher oxygen-to-metal flux ratios in MBE growth lead to remarkable incorporation of the catalyst element in the Ga2O3 layer, even though it is not clear if the incorporation can be also affected by the actual crystalline phase (i.e.,  or β). 12,97 Differently from the -phase, the stability of -Ga2O3 layers is apparently only weakly affected by different oxygen-to-metal flux ratios, as showed for heteroepitaxial growth by MBE on r-plane sapphire substrates. 82Regarding MOVPE with H2 and TEG, it was observed that a high pressure regime (&gt;100 mbar) favours the nucleation of -Ga2O3 in the gas phase resulting in films with a mosaic surface, while -Ga2O3 is obtained at lower pressures, as already discussed in paragraph 2.3. 64 For PLD, a flux of molecular oxygen is employed for the growth of oxide layers; for Sn-mediated growth of Ga2O3 it has been showed that the stabilization of the  phase over the β one is requiring lower oxygen fluxes (pO2 ≤ 1x10 -2 mbar). 79 For MBE growth it is complicated to discuss about absolute oxygen partial pressure values; in fact, as this deposition technique must work at significantly lower pressure regimes during deposition processes (≤ 10 -5 mbar), it therefore requires a flow of highly reactive oxygen so to allow for oxide layer depositions.

        <p>In this work we critically discussed the main aspects that rule the stabilization of different Ga2O3 polymorphs during growth. We considered and discussed all the main chemical and physical vapour phase deposition techniques and identified that the use of different precursors/catalysts (2.1), the deposition temperature (2.2), the growth rate (2.3), the substrate / nucleation layer (2.4), and the partial pressure of the processes (2.5) are all key parameters to be carefully considered for the synthesis of β, , or  Ga2O3 thin films.

        <p>From a fundamental point of view, some questions arise about the exact chemical mechanisms that result in the stabilization of the  phase, in particular concerning the role of additional elements involved in the growth process such as Cl, H (for CVD techniques) and Sn, In (PVD techniques). Additional insights in these processes could allow to expand the range of useful elements to stabilize -Ga2O3 and other metastable polymorphs.From a fundamental point of view, some questions arise about the exact chemical mechanisms that result in the stabilization of the  phase, in particular concerning the role of additional elements involved in the growth process such as Cl, H (for CVD techniques) and Sn, In (PVD techniques).

        <p>The role of growth kinetics on the stabilization of the phase is also an important topic, if one aims to optimize the synthesis conditions. Indeed, some results indicate that the growth rate might be an important parameter to control the nature of the polymorphs: with its higher growth rate, HVPE could be the most convenient solution to stabilize -Ga2O3 in a wide range of temperatures. Moreover, despite the different substrates adopted for Ga2O3 heteroepitaxy, just (001) oriented -Ga2O3 and (2 ̅ 01) oriented β-Ga2O3 layers were so far deposited. For both polymorphs these particular growth orientations result in the formation of domains which lead, in the of β, to the formation of dangling bonds at the domain interfaces while, in the case of , even without dangling bonds there could be negative effects on the transport properties of the layers. The use of different substrates and/or of proper offcuts could allow to investigate this issue.The role of growth kinetics on the stabilization of the phase is also an important topic, if one aims to optimize the synthesis conditions.
