        <p>Our world has been experiencing a global energy crisis, which has become exacerbated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, with widespread shortages and soaring prices in oil, gas, and electricity markets worldwide. Although the world possesses 46.6 times as high as its annual consumption levels of proven oil reserves, the depletion of fossil fuels as non-renewable energy is inevitable [1]. Additionally, burning fossil fuels emits a vast amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change [2,3]. It is estimated that human activities, especially the combustion of fossil fuels, have increased the Earth's global average temperature by approximately 1 °C since the pre-industrial period, and this number is currently increasing by more than 0.2 °C per decade. The effects of climate change on the environment are already noticeable, with glaciers and ice sheets reducing, river and lake ice breaking up earlier, and plant and animal ranges shifting. As a result, it is crucial to transform the conventional framework of energy utilization, which relies mainly on fossil fuels, into clean and renewable energy sources.Our world has been experiencing a global energy crisis, which has become exacerbated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, with widespread shortages and soaring prices in oil, gas, and electricity markets worldwide.

        <p>Solar energy is a highly sustainable source of energy that can be captured using various technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) [4], solar thermal converters [5], and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems [6]. At the top of the Earth's atmosphere, about 1360 W per square meter (W/m 2 ) of solar radiation can be received on average, while the amount of solar radiation on the Earth's surface is around 1000 to 1200 W/m 2 due to atmospheric absorption and scattering [7]. Despite the abundance of solar energy available, it only accounts for a small portion of the global primary energy supply. In 2020, the international energy agency reported that combined solar PV and solar thermal power accounted for merely 2% of the world's total primary energy supply. As such, highly efficient solar energy capturing and converting technologies are required to maximize the utilization efficiency of full-spectrum sunlight.Solar energy is a highly sustainable source of energy that can be captured using various technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) [4], solar thermal converters [5], and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems [6].

        <p>One of the promising pathways for the efficient transportation of solar energy is solar fuels, which are synthetic fuels produced from solar energy driven chemical reactions [8]. Solar fuels are considered to be the most economically viable and efficient solution for clean energy transportation and can be produced at a scale in an environmentally friendly way [9]. There are two pathways for solar energy to be converted into useful forms: solar-to-energetic hot carriers (EHC) [10] and photo-tolocalized thermal energy (LTE) [11]. Photocatalysis is an example of a solar-to-EHC process where light irradiation is used to excite EHC in photocatalysts for chemical reactions [12,13]. The emergence of photocatalysis technology is a milestone in environmentally sustainable energy research [14]. However, the low reaction rate of photocatalysis (R photo / I 0.5 , I represents light intensity) and the unfavourable selectivity to the target products significantly limit the widespread utilization of solar energy resources [15]. Additionally, most photo-induced thermal energy in a photocatalytic process is lost by cooling systems, leading to inefficient energy utilization. Therefore, a well-designed photodriven catalytic system with a high catalytic activity and minimal energy loss is essential for maximizing the utilization efficiency of global solar irradiance and mitigating the dependence on conventional fossil fuels.One of the promising pathways for the efficient transportation of solar energy is solar fuels, which are synthetic fuels produced from solar energy driven chemical reactions [8].

        <p>Photothermal catalysis has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional photocatalysis and thermocatalysis for energy transformation and environmental remediation due to its unprecedented light harvesting efficiency, superior throughputs, and moderate reaction conditions [16,17]. This technology integrates solar energy mediated photochemical processes and solar light-induced thermocatalysis into a single unit, creating a complementing and synergistic effect. When the catalyst materials absorb light, EHC are generated to directly participate in chemical reactions [18,19], while those that fail to participate in will be converted into heat by thermalization [20]. Consequently, photothermal catalysis compensates for the disadvantages of photocatalysis and thermocatalysis, improving reaction selectivity and reducing reaction barriers.

        <p>Photothermal catalysis is a technique sharing the same goal with photocatalysis to harvest solar energy for initiation of chemical processes, but completely differs from photocatalysis in reaction mechanism. In this process, when a catalyst absorbs photons, it converts solar energy into two essential components: EHC and LTE (Fig. 2) [30]. The EHC can be used to directly inject into the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the reactants for redox reactions or assist in lowering the specific bonding energy required for thermocatalytic processes [20]. Meanwhile, the LTE obtained from the cooling of hot carriers can be utilized to overcome energy barriers that prevent reaction initiation or accelerate reaction kinetics and photo-excited charge dynamics in photochemical processes [31]. The participation of these two components makes photothermal catalysis more advantageous than single component-driven conventional photocatalytic and thermocatalytic processes.Photothermal catalysis is a technique sharing the same goal with photocatalysis to harvest solar energy for initiation of chemical processes, but completely differs from photocatalysis in reaction mechanism.

        <p>For instance, dry reforming of methane with CO 2 (DRM) is an industrialized route to produce syngas that can be used for hydrogen generation and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of high value-added chemicals and fuels, such as methanol and gasoline [2,32,33]. As a highly endothermic reaction, critical temperatures and pressures are required to overcome the thermodynamic energy barrier of DRM [34]. Here, photothermal catalysis can help highlight benefits in terms of energy efficiency, cost, safety, and environmental impact by triggering the DRM process at ambient conditions of room temperature and pressure [35,36]. In addition, coupling photochemical processes with thermocatalysis has been shown to yield better performance and selectivity for syngas than photocatalysis or thermocatalysis alone [37][38][39]. Moreover, the photothermal catalytic technology offers greater control over reaction conditions compared to thermocatalysis, as the temperature of the photothermal catalytic reaction can be precisely adjusted by modifying the wavelength and intensity of the light source [33,[40][41][42]. Therefore, photothermal catalysis is an exciting area of research with great potential for advancing our understanding of catalytic processes and developing new technologies for energy conversion.For instance, dry reforming of methane with CO 2 (DRM) is an industrialized route to produce syngas that can be used for hydrogen generation and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of high value-added chemicals and fuels, such as methanol and gasoline [2,32,33].

        <p>A photo-to-electron process is a term widely referred in photovoltaics and photocatalytic technologies to describe the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy [45]. This process involves the absorption of photons (light energy) by a material, such as a semiconductor or plasmonic metal nanoparticles, to excite electrons and generate a flow of electric current [46][47][48]. The mechanism of semiconductor-based photocatalysis involves the excitation of electron-hole pairs due to the suitable band structure upon absorbing equivalent photons of light [49]. As a result, the excited electrons and holes can participate in chemical reactions with adsorbed molecules, generating reactive intermediates that lead to the desired reaction [50]. More specifically, when a photocatalyst is exposed to light, it absorbs photons to excite electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), creating electron-hole pairs [51]. These excited electrons and holes can separate and move to the surface of the photocatalyst, where they participate in redox reactions with adsorbed molecules on the surface (Fig. 2a) [43]. Inorganic (e.g., metal oxides [52,53], transition metal dichalcogenides [54][55][56], and black phosphorus [57]) and organic semiconductor-based photocatalysts (e.g., carbon nitride [58,59], metal organic frameworks [60,61] and covalent organic frameworks [62]) have been developed and used in various applications, including water splitting [21,63,64], CO 2 reduction [65], and organic pollutant degradation [66]. Despite the promising potential, the weak internal electrical field in semiconductorbased photocatalysis always results in fatigue charge carriers and short diffusion length of EHC, thereby leading to poor photo-to-electron conversion efficiencies [67].A photo-to-electron process is a term widely referred in photovoltaics and photocatalytic technologies to describe the conversion of solar energy into electrical energy [45].

        <p>Photo-to-thermal conversion is an innovative technology that harnesses solar energy to produce heat in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner. The process relies on the non-radiative relaxation, which indirectly converts irradiation into heat, as well as absorption of infrared (IR) radiation, which directly converts solar radiation into thermal energy. In a Schottky heterojunction, the energy of the excited electrons in plasmonic nanometals must be within the limitations of E F + ћx ! E ! E F + E B and p 2 z /2m &gt; E B + E F for the hot electrons to be injected into the semiconductor (Fig. 2d-e) [20]. However, if the hot carriers fail to overcome the Schottky barrier or the anti-bonding orbital of the reactant molecule (Fig. 2f), hot electrons will release their energy through Ohmic damping and transfer them to phonon modes, leading to an increase of temperature on the nanometals and their surroundings (Fig. 2g).Photo-to-thermal conversion is an innovative technology that harnesses solar energy to produce heat in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner.

        <p>Additionally, non-radiative relaxation occurs on semiconductor-based catalysts through either Auger recombination or Shockley-Read-Hall recombination (Fig. 2h). This leads to the dissipation of excessive energy as lattice vibrations or phonons, resulting in heat generation. The dissipation of energy in the form of phonons can cause the local heating of the lattice, resulting in a temperature distribution reliant on optical absorption and bulk/surface recombination. The optically excited charge carriers then diffuse and recombine, establishing a temperature distribution that leads to the photothermal effect of semiconductor materials.Additionally, non-radiative relaxation occurs on semiconductor-based catalysts through either Auger recombination or Shockley-Read-Hall recombination (Fig. 2h).

The excited electrons relax by means of electron phonon coupling, hence, the light energy absorbed is transferred from the excited electrons to vibrational modes throughout the atomic lattices, leading to a temperature rise in the material.Furthermore, carbonaceous and organic materials exhibit a photothermal effect that is highly dependent on the p to the p* orbitals, which requires a lower energy input (Fig. 2i) [76].

        <p>Consequently, the photo-to-thermal process always follows the photoelectrical process in photothermal catalysis. Only the hot carriers that are not effectively output for redox reactions can be decayed into LTE, which forms the foundation regarding the classification of photothermal catalysis and the design and development of photothermal catalysts.

        <p>Photocatalysis and photo-driven thermocatalysis are two interrelated processes and significantly contribute to photothermal catalytic performance. The difference is that photocatalysis employs solar energy to excite electrons, elevating their energy levels and resulting in reactive intermediates such as free radicals and TNI for chemical reactions, while photo-driven thermocatalysis utilizes solar energy to generate localized heat and thereby initiate chemical processes. Combining these two processes in a single photothermal catalytic unit can have a multifaceted promoting effect. Specifically, traditional thermocatalytic reactions typically require critical reaction conditions, such as high temperature and pressure. However, photoexcitation has been harnessed to unlock low-temperature equilibrium regimes and increase catalyst temperature, thereby promoting thermocatalytic reactions [77]. Additionally, EHC's participation in thermocatalytic processes increases selectivity by injecting into specific reactive intermediates [40]. Thermal energy, in turn, can be used to overcome the limitations of photocatalysis and promote the excitation and generation of EHC [78,79]. Thus, visible and near infrared light can be used to drive photochemical reactions when thermal energy is supplied to the photothermal catalytic system [80]. Moreover, this cooperation is effective because elevated reaction temperature significantly reduces the redox potentials of reactants, enabling EHC's involvement in redox reactions [81].Photocatalysis and photo-driven thermocatalysis are two interrelated processes and significantly contribute to photothermal catalytic performance.

        <p>Nonetheless, suppressing effects between photochemical and thermocatalytic processes in photothermal catalysis also exist. Specifically, at higher temperature, the charge dynamics will slow down and EHC decay rates promote. The contribution from EHC to photothermal catalysis in such conditions therefore remains a topic of debate. Additionally, we have experimentally found that photochemical and thermocatalytic processes compete for active sites on a photothermal catalyst, with thermocatalysis occupying more active sites when the temperature reaches the minimum onset temperature of thermocatalysis, resulting in a diminished EHC output [82]. As such, it is vital to quantify the contributions of EHC and LTE to photothermal catalysis and optimize their interactions to maximize light harvesting efficiency and photothermal catalytic performance.Nonetheless, suppressing effects between photochemical and thermocatalytic processes in photothermal catalysis also exist.

        <p>Based on the above discussions on photochemical and photo-tothermal processes, photothermal catalysis can be categorized into three groups, depending on the extent of the contribution from thermal energy to the catalytic process. These categories are thermal-dominated photothermal catalysis (TPT), carrierthermal coupling catalysis (CTC), and hot carriers dominated photothermal catalysis (CPT) (see Fig. 3). It is important to note that externally heated photocatalysis represents a distinct type of photothermal catalysis where a portion of the thermal energy is supplied through external heating [82]. With the advancement of light-concentrating devices, solar concentrating technology is expected to eventually replace the need for external heating, initiating chemical reactions in a more sustainable and cleaner manner [83,84]. This particular process can be further classified into TPT and CTC processes based on the combined contribution of thermal energy, including both photo-generated thermal energy and externally supplied thermal energy, to the overall catalytic efficiency.Based on the above discussions on photochemical and photo-tothermal processes, photothermal catalysis can be categorized into three groups, depending on the extent of the contribution from thermal energy to the catalytic process.

        <p>In TPT, most of the photo-excited hot carriers cannot be injected into the HOMO/LUMO of the reactants and decay in the form of heat due to ohmic damping. Consequently, the contribution of most hot carriers to TPT catalytic throughput is RESEARCH: Review predominantly attributed to induced thermal energy rather than direct injection. Only the EHC with enough energy to weaken or break specific bonding for intermediates are responsible for catalytic activity. For instance, Group VIII transition metal nanoparticles (e.g., iron, cobalt, and nickel) on Al 2 O 3 exhibit weaker plasmonic properties in the visible and near-infrared spectral range due to the filled d-band [85,86]. This, in turn, reduces the efficiency of directly reducing/oxidizing adsorbed molecules. Instead, the localized temperature on the catalyst can be rapidly elevated to $400 °C within half an hour of light illumination, leading to an efficient DRM by TPT for syngas production.In TPT, most of the photo-excited hot carriers cannot be injected into the HOMO/LUMO of the reactants and decay in the form of heat due to ohmic damping.

        <p>By contrast, once the photo-excited hot carriers are energetic enough and photo-generated LTE in a photothermal catalytic process fails to overcome the thermodynamic reaction barrier of chemical processes, the yield or throughput of the reaction is highly dependent on photo-excited hot carriers for directly participating into the redox reactions of reactants. This is known as a CPT process. The essence of CPT is a photochemical process, where thermal energy exists for accelerating the dynamics of photo-induced charge carriers and lowering the redox potentials of reactants. The CPT technology has been widely applied in water splitting related processes, such as water splitting for green hydrogen and CO 2 /N 2 reduction reaction with water, where photo-induced EHC serves as the main driving force to realize water dissociation.

        <p>Photothermal catalytic activities have been observed in a wide range of materials, including semiconductors, nanometals, black materials, and their hybrids. To gain a deeper understanding of the above classified CPT, TPT and CTC processes, we can describe photothermal catalysts as P x B 1-x , which consists of photo-toelectron components and/or black materials (Fig. 4a). When x is close to 1, the photothermal catalyst is mainly a photocatalyst and is commonly used in the CPT process. However, in most photocatalytic systems, photothermal effect is often overlooked due to the dissipation of thermal energy by the cooling water system. An experimental work has revealed that the temperature of water solution can be increased from 25 to 57 °C in 4 h with a 300 W xenon lamp irradiation during a solar driven water splitting reaction using semiconductors (i.e., TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 ) as catalysts [88]. Besides, the enhancement of photothermal effect on chemical synthesis was also observed when heating was left in photocatalysis in the absence of cooling system, fully confirming the nonnegligible photothermal effect in a CPT process [45]. When x is close to 0, the photothermal catalyst is always a black material such as carbon, amorphous boron, MXene, thermoelectric, transition nanometal, and their hybrids [94,95]. This material is highly effective in converting full spectrum sunlight into thermal energy and is often used in TPT processes. For example, amorphous boron has demonstrated outstanding TPT catalytic performance in CO 2 reduction by rapidly increasing the localized temperature to 462 °C in just 10 min [96].

This hybridization is popular in CTC processes, where it takes advantage of both EHC and LTE. Numerous materials have been used in these hybrids, such as bimetallic integration of coinage and transition metals (e.g., Au-Pt [90], Cu-Ru [42], and Au-Ru [36]), transition metal/semiconductor hybrids (e.g., Pt/TiO 2 [82] and Ru/HNb 3 O 8 [98]), and semiconductor/black material hybrids (e.g., TiO 2 /graphene [99] and Bi 2 Se 3 /g-C 3 N 4 [100]).Photothermal catalytic activities have been observed in a wide range of materials, including semiconductors, nanometals, black materials, and their hybrids.

        <p>It can be clearly seen from Fig. 5b that Au and Ag are strong plasmonic metals that can effectively scatter and absorb light in the visible and near-infrared regions, while Cu has a relatively weak plasmonic response but a high electron mobility. Besides, the wavelength of light that matches the LSPR resonance of a metal nanoparticle depends on the particle's size. Specifically, the LSPR resonance shifts to longer wavelengths with an increasing nanoparticle size, owing to the reduced confinement of electrons. As a result, smaller nanoparticles exhibit higher absorption efficiency than larger nanoparticles resonant at longer wavelengths, for a given wavelength of incident light [106]. In addition, the light-absorption properties of plasmonic metal nanoparticles are influenced by their geometric parameters, such as shape and crystal structure. Different shapes can lead to different resonant modes, affecting the absorption properties. For instance, spherical nanoparticles exhibit a dipolar resonance mode, while nanorods can exhibit both dipolar and quadrupolar resonance modes.

        <p>IEF manipulation is a process of breaking the symmetry of materials, which can be easily realized by the heterostructure fabrication technique in semiconductors. The Fermi level equilibrium at the contact area is formed by different semiconductors with distinct work functions, leading to electron transfer and creating IEF to drive photo-excited charge carriers separated by the heterojunction. Currently, type II, Z-, and S-scheme heterostructures are predominantly reported for semiconductor-based heterojunctions (Fig. 6a). In the type II regime, photo-excited hot carriers move from a higher CB/VB to a lower CB/VB, resulting in faster separation of charge carriers but reduced redox abilities and a higher possibility of LTE. On the other hand, the Z-or S-scheme heterosystem permits photo-excited hot electron transfer from a semiconductor with a lower CB to the VB of another semiconductor for combination, leaving hot carriers at higher redox potentials for more EHC.IEF manipulation is a process of breaking the symmetry of materials, which can be easily realized by the heterostructure fabrication technique in semiconductors.

        <p>An intensified electric field can also be achieved at the interface between a metal and a semiconductor in Schottky heterojunctions, leading to more EHC and LTE for photothermal catalysis. When a metal is brought into contact with a semiconductor, a depletion region is formed at the interface due to the difference in work function. This depletion region results in a built-in electric field, which promotes the charge separation and improves the charge dynamics. In a Schottky heterojunction for an enhanced electric field, the metal and support materials are carefully chosen to optimize the electric field at the interface. For example, platinum with a high work function can be used in contact with TiO 2 to create a Schottky heterojunction with a high built-in electric field (Fig. 6b). However, interfacial charge separation channels cannot be created when Pt is loaded on Al 2 O 3 , which leaves an enhanced electric field on the surface of Pt nanoparticles [108].An intensified electric field can also be achieved at the interface between a metal and a semiconductor in Schottky heterojunctions, leading to more EHC and LTE for photothermal catalysis.

        <p>Bimetallic structures can also be used to enhance the electric field as Schottky heterojunctions. A LSPR effect can be produced by combining two different metals, resulting in a strong electromagnetic field enhancement at the interface. Accordingly, a range of bimetallic nanoparticles (e.g., PtAu, RuCu, and CoNi) have been manufactured. As an example, a RuAu bimetallic catalyst was constructed and showed significantly strengthened electrical field compared to the monometallic materials, despite lacking a contact interface (Fig. 6c) [36]. Consequently, a higher photothermal catalytic DRM performance was achieved due to the increase of EHC and LTE. In contrast, a metal alloy as a homogenous solid material composed of two or more metallic elements displayed different properties (e.g., reflective index) from those of the individual metals, allowing for optimized IEF.

        <p>In general, the IEF of photothermal catalysts can be notably improved using various modification strategies, which significantly promote more EHC and LTE to participate into chemical reactions. However, selectively generating EHC and LTE remains a challenge and needs to be overcome, particularly considering their paradoxical contributions in photothermal catalysis, which lacks precise characterization techniques and reaction design. Recently, a significant study from Linic's group demonstrated that the plasmon-induced activation of reactants via electronic excitation or photothermal heating plays a critical role in driving LSPR-induced chemical reactions [111]. Therefore, future efforts should focus on the precise generation and contribution of EHC/LTE to specific reactions to rationally utilize solar energy.In general, the IEF of photothermal catalysts can be notably improved using various modification strategies, which significantly promote more EHC and LTE to participate into chemical reactions.

        <p>The efficiency of a photothermal catalytic process is determined by two factors: hot spots, the region of energy accumulated, and catalytic sites, the region with a low thermodynamic barrier. EHC and LTE are the driving forces to support the photochemical and thermocatalytic processes, respectively, and both are accumulated at the hot spots of the catalyst [112]. Therefore, a unification of hot spots and catalytic sites can double the effectiveness of the photothermal catalytic process, otherwise will reduce the effectiveness by half (Fig. 7a) [113]. The interfacial effect plays a crucial role in determining the accumulation region of EHC and LTE and is essential for controlling the transfer of EHC after generation. However, the random directions of IEF at the interface of semiconductor heterojunctions pose a challenge in achieving effective charge accumulation at the active sites. For addressing this issue, an integrated carbon nitride homojunction with a tandem IEF was developed to achieve fast charge separation and effective accumulation of hot electrons on the catalyst surface for efficient hydrogen reduction (as shown in Fig. 6a) [109].The efficiency of a photothermal catalytic process is determined by two factors: hot spots, the region of energy accumulated, and catalytic sites, the region with a low thermodynamic barrier.

        <p>The same problem also occurs at the Schottky barrier, where an induced IEF is always employed for a rapid separation of EHC. Manipulating IEF at the metal-support interface is highly desired to accumulate more EHC and LTE at the catalytic sites for highly efficient outputs. The reaction temperature has been evidenced to play a crucial role in changing the accumulation region of EHC and LTE. At low temperatures, the interfacial effect plays a decisive role in EHC assembly and TPT catalysis, while it weakens as the temperature increases owing to the weakened charge dynamics (Fig. 7b) [108]. Modulating the electronic structure of the support can also tune the interfacial effect and improve photothermal catalytic performance. For example, the classical support metal strong interaction (SMSI) effect observed in Ru/TiO 2 increases the electron density of Ru nanoparticles (NPs) under illumination [114]. However, in the DRM reaction process, the dissociation of CAH bonds of CH 4 occurs on electron-deficient sites on the metal surfaces and is the ratedetermining step. Consequently, an inconsistency between hot spots and catalytic sites inhibits the SMSI effect on solar-driven photothermal DRM. To address this issue, Jia et al. modified the electronic structure of the TiO 2 support by introducing oxygen vacancy, creating an interfacial effect to manipulate the photo-induced electrons transfer to the support. The resultant suppressive SMSI effect created electron-deficient sites on Ru NPs, improving CH 4 dissociation and intensifying photothermal catalytic DRM (Fig. 7c).The same problem also occurs at the Schottky barrier, where an induced IEF is always employed for a rapid separation of EHC.

        <p>Additionally, the strength and configuration of interfacial coordination play a critical role in the dynamic motion of a metal on a support, thus determining the catalyst stability. Single atom catalysts (SACs) have a simple metal-support configuration that is useful in probing catalytic mechanisms. A Pd-SAC, for instance, displays exceptional activity and stability in photothermal catalytic hydrogenation of C 2 H 2 with H 2 when atomically dispersed Pd on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fig. 7d) [115]. This is because of the strong coordination between the Pd and nitrogen atoms and the lower EHC accumulation at the metal-support interface, which results in less Pd aggregation. However, when an atomic metal is immobilized on semiconductor-based materials such as TiO 2 and g-C 3 N 4 , metal aggregation tends to occur after photothermal catalytic chemical reactions (Fig. 7e). It has been discovered that surface migration of metal-SACs can be accelerated by the initial SAC loading, photogenerated electrons, and reactive intermediates, leading to metal nanoparticle agglomeration [88,116,117]. Therefore, accurate modulation of the interfacial effect to control charge transfer is critical for achieving highly efficient and stable photothermal catalysis for chemical reactions.Additionally, the strength and configuration of interfacial coordination play a critical role in the dynamic motion of a metal on a support, thus determining the catalyst stability.

        <p>Photo-carriers regulation Photothermal catalysis has demonstrated great potentials to large-scale productions of solar fuels. Whereas, intermittent availability of sunlight is the biggest obstacle for 24/7 solardriven catalytic operations. It has been reported that 40% of power losses occur in photovoltaic systems during overcast days, so EHC cannot be excited in the dark (Fig. 7f) [119]. As a result, regulation of EHCs enabled by catalyst design for robust participation into photothermal catalysis is highly important but challenging for practical application of photothermal catalysis. To address this, researchers are proposing the modification of photocatalysts with energy-storing materials to generate electrons or holes persistently, even in the absence of sunlight. Pseudocapacitance, which determines the surface electrochemical charge storage by surface redox reactions or ion adsorption/desorption, plays a vital role in these photocatalysts (Fig. 7g) [118]. When hot electrons serve as the primary charge carriers for catalysis and the intensity of light exceeds a certain threshold, photoexcited hot electrons migrate across the heterojunction of the photocatalyst and accumulate within the pseudocapacitor, typically composed of electron-storing materials like WO 3 , SnO 2 , or TiO 2 . Meanwhile, excessive holes are effectively eliminated by hole scavengers. During periods of darkness, the discharge of electrons from the pseudocapacitor drives the reduction reaction, ensuring continuous catalytic operations even in the absence of light. Conversely, hole-storing materials such as Ni(OH) 2 are employed to facilitate a continuous oxidation process. This inherent 24/7 capability of energy-storing materials offers a more compact and efficient alternative to integrating photovoltaic and battery systems, thereby minimizing energy losses.

        <p>Hydrogen, which is an eco-friendly and promising renewable energy option with a high energy density of approximately 120 MJ/kg, has captured a significant attention. In photothermal catalytic water splitting, the process may be primarily dependent on CPT, where EHC acts as the primary driver for hydrogen reduction. Photothermal effects in this process, such as lowering the electrical impedance, reducing the band gap, and increased light absorption of the photothermal catalyst, can significantly enhance the hydrogen evolution performance [88]. Furthermore, the photothermal effect can increase catalyst wetting ability, which in turn decreases bubble adhesion and bubble radius for detachment from the surface, leading to vivid improvements in reaction kinetics [126].Hydrogen, which is an eco-friendly and promising renewable energy option with a high energy density of approximately 120 MJ/kg, has captured a significant attention.

        <p>For liquid-solid phase chemical synthesis, EHC plays a vital role in producing high-value chemicals and fuels and LTE promotes the injection of EHC into HOMO and LUMO of adsorbents. For instance, CPT catalysis has been utilized in the selective oxidation of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dic arboxylate (1,4-DHP) to produce bioactive compounds such as antihypertensive agents and calcium channel blockers.

        <p>Despite the significant improvements in the performance of liquid-solid phase reactions by photothermal catalysis, understanding the actual reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface remains elusive. While photothermal catalysis can dissipate heat into the bulk solution in a liquid-solid phase reaction, superheating always occurs at the liquid-solid interface [127], heating the liquid above its boiling point and enabling reactant molecules metastable. Therefore, it is crucial to reveal the surface temperature of the catalyst using advanced characterization and monitoring techniques underlying the real reaction mechanism on catalyst surface, which is beneficial for catalyst developments and reaction optimizations [91].Despite the significant improvements in the performance of liquid-solid phase reactions by photothermal catalysis, understanding the actual reaction mechanism on the catalyst surface remains elusive.

However, traditional gas-solid phase catalysis often requires high temperature, high pressure, and significant energy consumption. Photothermal gas-solid phase catalysis has emerged as a promising approach to convert fossil fuels into cleaner energy sources at ambient conditions using photothermal catalysts. Due to the low heat conduction coefficient of gases, the temperature of the catalysts can be rapidly increased and is positively correlated with the intensity of light irradiation. By concentrating sunlight using a light concentrator, the intensity can be increased up to 1000 to 10000 mW/cm 2 , resulting in the temperature of over one thousand degrees on the catalyst surface, which can easily initiate the conversion of stubborn molecules such as CO 2 and CH 4 .Catalytic gas-solid phase processes are commonly used in the chemical industry to produce fertilizers, chemicals, and fuels by accelerating the conversion of gases (reactants) into other gases (products).

        <p>Photothermal catalysis not only enhances performance but also changes the reaction pathway. Two photothermal catalytic mechanisms, CTC and TPT, have been widely reported, with the latter actually being a thermocatalytic process. In the TPT process, reaction selectivity can only be controlled by modifying the catalyst, whereas EHC in the CTC process can selectively decrease the activation energy for specific intermediates, thus increasing reaction selectivity. CO 2 , produced as a by-product of human activities such as burning fossil fuels, is an important feedstock for fuel production, and a high product selectivity is highly desirable in this process. Liu et al. utilized rhodium nanoparticles to improve performance in the CTC for catalytic carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction, reducing the activation energy and producing selectively a desired but kinetically unfavourable product (Fig. 9) [72]. Mild illumination of rhodium nanoparticles resulted in almost exclusive methane production, as hot electrons were injected into the anti-bonding orbital of a critical intermediate. Without illumination, CO and CH 4 were equally produced. The reduced activation energy and superlinear dependence on light intensity led to the photothermal catalytic methane production rate at ambient conditions exceeding the thermocatalytic rate at 350 °C.Photothermal catalysis not only enhances performance but also changes the reaction pathway.

        <p>EHC and LTE have demonstrated excellent reactant conversion and better product selectivity in photothermal (CTC and TPT) catalytic gas-solid phase reactions at moderate conditions. Although thermal energy promoted EHC has made significant contributions to the CTC process, temperature can also accelerate the excited state decay and charge recombination processes. Additionally, competition between EHC and LTE exists on the active site of the photothermal catalyst in the CTC process. Therefore, optimizing reaction conditions and precisely quantifying the contributions of EHC and LTE are crucial to maximize solar energy utilization and catalytic throughput.EHC and LTE have demonstrated excellent reactant conversion and better product selectivity in photothermal (CTC and TPT) catalytic gas-solid phase reactions at moderate conditions.

        <p>For the photothermal catalytic reaction to occur, an efficient, reliable, and suitable light source is required to provide the necessary intensity and wavelength of light. Solar concentrator systems have been developed to concentrate sunlight and provide the required energy for the reaction. These systems fall into four categories: parabolic trough, central power tower, parabolic dish, and double concentration, which can facilitate temperatures in the range of 500-700, 1600, over 1800, and over 1500 K, respectively. The selection of the corresponding system depends on the required temperature for the reaction. Stephane et al. utilized a parabolic dish to concentrate solar light, resulting in the delivery of 16 MW/m 2 flux of solar irradiation to the chemical reactor [134]. To decrease the energy loss within solar concentrator systems, they further integrated a solar light concentration system with the reaction into one solar reactor. This was achieved by coupling a primary sun-tracking paraboloidal concentrator to a secondary planar rotating reflector [84]. As a result, the reaction temperature could be ramped up to above 1400 °C, which allowed the use of the full solar light spectrum (Fig. 10d).For the photothermal catalytic reaction to occur, an efficient, reliable, and suitable light source is required to provide the necessary intensity and wavelength of light.
