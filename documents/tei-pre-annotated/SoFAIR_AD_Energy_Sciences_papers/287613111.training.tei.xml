        <p>The existing literature on renewable energy consumption and economic growth nexus produces mixed results as the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth can be either positive, negative or not significant. This paper examines the causal link between renewable energy use and economic growth by employing a threshold model using a 103-country sample in the 1995 to 2015 period. We find that the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth depends on the amount of renewable energy used. Our results demonstrate that the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is positive and significant if and only if developing countries or non-OECD countries surpass a certain threshold of renewable energy consumption. However, if developing countries use renewable energy below a given threshold level, the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is negative. However, we also find that renewable energy consumption has no significant effect on economic growth in developed countries and a positive and significant effect on economic growth in OECD countries. The findings of this paper suggest that for developing countries to realize positive economic growth from their investment to renewable energy, they need to surpass a certain threshold of renewable energy consumption.The existing literature on renewable energy consumption and economic growth nexus produces mixed results as the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth can be either positive, negative or not significant.

        <p>Renewable energy sources have gained growing importance in the world energy consumption portfolio over recent years due to the increasingly negative consequences of climate change, volatile energy prices, and favorable government policies towards renewable energy use.Renewable energy sources have gained growing importance in the world energy consumption portfolio over recent years due to the increasingly negative consequences of climate change, volatile energy prices, and favorable government policies towards renewable energy use.</p>
        <p>The IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation suggests that historical increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have resulted from the provision of energy services and that increases in renewable energy not only mitigate the effects of climate change (see e.g., Shafiei and Salim, 2014;Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018;Inglesi-Lotz and Dogan, 2018;Belaïd and Zrelli, 2019 among many others that demonstrated that the increases in renewable energy consumption leads to lower Co2 emissions) but also could contribute to a number of crucial sustainable development goals such as social and economic development, energy access, energy security and reduction of environmental and health impacts (Edenhofer et al., 2011). Due to the wider benefits of renewable energy use, the share of renewables in meeting global energy demand is expected to grow by one-fifth in the next five years to reach 12.4% in 2023 based on the International Energy Agency (2018) projections.The IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation suggests that historical increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have resulted from the provision of energy services and that increases in renewable energy not only mitigate the effects of climate change (see e.g., Shafiei and Salim, 2014;Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018;Inglesi-Lotz and Dogan, 2018;Belaïd and Zrelli, 2019 among many others that demonstrated that the increases in renewable energy consumption leads to lower Co2 emissions) but also could contribute to a number of crucial sustainable development goals such as social and economic development, energy access, energy security and reduction of environmental and health impacts (Edenhofer et al., 2011).

        <p>With the increased use of renewable energy, there has been an extensive amount of literature that examined the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. There is a stream of literature that found no causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, also known as the neutrality hypothesis (neutrality hypothesis is supported by Menegaki (2011) for 27 European countries, Omri et al. (2015) for Brazil, Finland, and Switzerland;Chang et al. (2015) for Canada, Italy and the USA, Bulut and Muratoglu (2018) for Turkey, among others). On the other hand, another stream of literature found that renewable energy consumption increases economic growth (e.g., positive effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is supported by Bhattacharya et al. (2016) and Bhattacharya et al. (2017) for large set of countries, Chang et al. (2015) for Germany and Japan, Inglesi-Lotz (2016) for the OECD countries, Magnani and Vaona (2013) for Italian regions, Ozturk and Bilgili (2015) for 51 Sub-Saharan African countries, among many others).With the increased use of renewable energy, there has been an extensive amount of literature that examined the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth.

        <p>The third stream of literature demonstrates that increases in renewable energy consumption lead to negative economic growth due to high investment costs (see e.g., negative effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is identified by Ocal and Aslan (2013) for Turkey; Marques and Fuinhas (2012) for 24 European countries; Bhattacharya et al. (2016) for India, Ukraine, the US and Israel). Hence it seems that there is no agreement in the literature about the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth. This paper aims to provide a convincing argument about why the existing literature has found mixed and contradicting results.The third stream of literature demonstrates that increases in renewable energy consumption lead to negative economic growth due to high investment costs (see e.g., negative effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is identified by Ocal and Aslan (2013) for Turkey; Marques and Fuinhas (2012) for 24 European countries; Bhattacharya et al.

        <p>The use of the panel threshold model, where the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth may differ depending on the renewable energy consumption threshold, provides an explanation of why the results vary when a different set of countries are considered in the analysis. In other words, the panel threshold model allows us to test whether the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth varies if a given country consumes renewable energy above or below the threshold. Below we will provide a detailed discussion on why we expect to find a threshold that is determinant on the effect of renewable energy consumption's effect on economic growth.The use of the panel threshold model, where the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth may differ depending on the renewable energy consumption threshold, provides an explanation of why the results vary when a different set of countries are considered in the analysis.

        <p>There have been arguments in the literature that the storage capacity for renewable energy sources is relatively low compared to that of fossil-based fuels, something that may lead to energy supply problems during the high peak demand periods (Heal, 2009;Forsberg, 2009;Apergis et al., 2010). Furthermore, switching from traditional non-renewable resources of energy production to technology-based renewable sources requires large up-front investments, which may affect the economic growth negatively (Marques and Fuinhas, 2012;Ocal and Aslan, 2013). Furthermore, Marques and Fuinhas (2012) argue that costs of development of renewable energy sources are provided by public policies which may raise the final cost of energy, assuming that regulators include these costs in the final price of electricity. For instance, Astariz and Iglesias (2015) reviewed cost estimates for ten electricity generation technologies and suggested that the most cost-effective technology is pulverized fuel, where the production cost of an energy unit of non-renewable energy sources was cheaper than that of renewable energy sources. In sum, due to the above-mentioned mechanisms, increases in renewable energy sources could lead to negative effects on economic growth.There have been arguments in the literature that the storage capacity for renewable energy sources is relatively low compared to that of fossil-based fuels, something that may lead to energy supply problems during the high peak demand periods (Heal, 2009;Forsberg, 2009;Apergis et al., 2010).

        <p>Even though initial investment costs of deployment of renewable energy sources are high compared to non-renewable, there has been a major decline in costs for solar and wind technologies over the last few years (see, e.g., IRENA, 2019), which would lead to lower costs of renewable energy generation. Similarly, Rubin et al. (2015) review empirical learning rates that have been reported for a broad spectrum of electric power generation technologies and suggest that learning rates from power plant technologies using fossil fuels were lower in magnitude than those for renewable energy technologies. Therefore, the average cost of renewable energy generation is likely to fall with the increased use of renewable energy. Schilling and Esmundo (2009) show that the generation of electricity per kWh has been increasing at an increasing rate with the increases in R&amp;D investment in renewable energy technologies suggesting that the costs of renewable energy have been decreasing at an increasing rate when the renewable energy investment was higher. Hence, countries that use relatively higher renewable energy are likely to face increasingly lower rates of costs of renewable energy consumption.Even though initial investment costs of deployment of renewable energy sources are high compared to non-renewable, there has been a major decline in costs for solar and wind technologies over the last few years (see, e.g., IRENA, 2019), which would lead to lower costs of renewable energy generation.

        <p>Based on the above literature, we expect that if countries use relatively lower levels of renewable energy, then the relative cost of using renewable energy compared to fossil fuels may be higher and hence the renewable energy consumption or growth of renewable energy consumption may not lead to a significant effect (or even may have a negative effect) on economic growth for these countries. However, for countries that consume relatively higher levels of renewable energy, the use of renewable energy and growth of renewable energy consumption may affect economic growth positively as the cost of renewable energy could be relatively lower than that of non-renewable energy. To test this argument, we use renewable energy consumption as a threshold variable and examine whether there exists a threshold level of renewable energy with the use of panel threshold models where the effect of renewable energy consumption or growth of renewable energy consumption on economic growth differs below and above a renewable energy consumption threshold.Based on the above literature, we expect that if countries use relatively lower levels of renewable energy, then the relative cost of using renewable energy compared to fossil fuels may be higher and hence the renewable energy consumption or growth of renewable energy consumption may not lead to a significant effect (or even may have a negative effect) on economic growth for these countries.

        <p>However, to our knowledge, only a small body of literature examined the potential non-linear relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. This study uses a panel sample splitting methodology to test whether there exists a renewable energy consumption threshold level, where the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth would differ above and below this level. Second, most of the existing literature that examined the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth using unit root and cointegration tests adopted the assumption of cross-sectional independence. However, it is common for macro-level data to violate this assumption hence resulting in low power and size distortions for the tests that assume cross-section independence (Pesaran, 2015) 1 . Therefore, our study uses recently developed panel data methods that take cross-sectional dependence into account. Thirdly, given the existing studies found that the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth varies based on the set of countries used, we also examine whether the findings obtained with the threshold model for the whole set of countries are different when using different subsets of countries such as OECD, non-OECD, developed and developing countries.However, to our knowledge, only a small body of literature examined the potential non-linear relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth.

        <p>There has been an increasing stand of literature that examines the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth (see Table 1 summary of the relevant literature examining the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth). This literature mainly tests four potential hypotheses: (1) the feedback hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that suggests that there is a bidirectional causation between renewable energy consumption and economic growth); (2) the growth hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that suggests that there is a one-way causation from renewable energy consumption to economic growth); 3) 1 There are only few studies that considered the potential cross-section dependence when examining the link between energy consumption and economic growth (see e.g., Cowan et al., 2014;Osman et al., 2016;Belaïd and Zrelli, 2019). the conservative hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that suggests that there is a one-way causation from economic growth to renewable energy consumption); 4) the neutrality (i.e., the hypothesis that suggests that there is no causational link between renewable energy consumption and economic growth).There has been an increasing stand of literature that examines the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth (see Table 1 summary of the relevant literature examining the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth).

        <p>&lt;Insert Table 1 approximately here&gt; Based on the country and period coverage, research in the area relies on different methodologies to examine the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. Most of the papers in the literature use panel data methodologies such as panel cointegration tests, Granger causality, dynamic or vector error correction methods to examine the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth (Apergis and Danuletiu, 2014;Apergis and Payne, 2010;Apergis and Payne, 2011;Apergis and Payne, 2012;Bhattacharya et al., 2016;Bulut and Muratoglu, 2018;Chang et al., 2015;Inglesi-Lotz, 2016;Kahia et al., 2017;Koçak and Şarkgüneşi, 2017;Lin and Mubarek, 2014;Ozturk and Bilgili, 2015;Pao et al., 2014;Salim et al., 2014;Salim and Rafiq, 2012) where most of this literature employed fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) to estimate the long-run elasticities. Another popular methodology in this relationship has been the use of linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration developed by Pesaran et al. (2001) and non-linear ARDL developed by Shin et al. (2014) (see, e.g., Tugcu et al. (2012) and Tugcu and Topcu (2018) for the use of linear and non-linear ARDL methods in examining the relationship between renewable energy and economic growth).&lt;Insert Table 1 approximately here&gt; Based on the country and period coverage, research in the area relies on different methodologies to examine the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth.

        <p>Finally, another panel methodology has been the generalized methods of moments (GMM), which can tackle potential endogeneity problems (Bhattacharya et al., 2017;Magnani and Vaona, 2013;Omri et al., 2015;Narayan and Doytch, 2017).Finally, another panel methodology has been the generalized methods of moments (GMM), which can tackle potential endogeneity problems (Bhattacharya et al., 2017;Magnani and Vaona, 2013;Omri et al., 2015;Narayan and Doytch, 2017).</p>
        <p>Depending on the methodology and sample of countries, all four hypotheses have been verified empirically. For instance, when the entire panel data set is used, the majority of the findings either support the feedback hypothesis (Apergis and Danuletiu, 2014;Apergis and Payne, 2010;Apergis and Payne, 2011;Apergis and Payne, 2012;Chang et al., 2015;Kahia et al., 2017;Narayan and Doytch, 2017;Pao et al., 2014;Salim et al., 2014;Salim and Rafiq, 2012) or the growth hypothesis (Bhattacharya et al., 2016;Bhattacharya et al., 2017;Inglesi-Lotz, 2016;Magnani and Vaona, 2013;Ozturk and Bilgili, 2015;Pao et al., 2014) with the exception of findings of Menegaki (2011) which supports the neutrality hypothesis for the European countries. However, when the relationship between renewable energy and economic growth is analyzed for specific countries, different hypotheses are supported when different set of countries are used in the analysis, and all four-hypotheses are verified for some (Chang et al., 2015;Koçak and Şarkgüneşi, 2017;Omri et al., 2015;Tugcu and Topcu, 2018;Tugcu et al., 2012).Depending on the methodology and sample of countries, all four hypotheses have been verified empirically.

        <p>It is noticeable that the findings from the literature are mixed depending on the method used and country coverage. However, one commonality of the literature is that most of the studies in this strand of literature examine a linear relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth with few exceptions. For instance, Chang et al. (2009) used the panel threshold regression method proposed by Hansen (1999) and found that countries characterized by high economic growth are able to respond to high energy prices with increases in renewable energy consumption, but no direct causal link was found between economic growth and renewable energy consumption for low-economic growth countries. On the other hand, in a recent study, by using nonlinear ARDL approach developed by Shin et al. (2014) and the asymmetric causality procedure proposed by Hatemi-J (2012), Tugcu and Topcu (2018) find that long-run results provide strong support for an asymmetric relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, and recommend that future studies should use an empirical methodology that can examine this asymmetric linkage between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. In this paper, in the line of Tugcu and Topcu (2018) findings, we will examine the potential non-linear relationship between renewable energy and economic growth based on the use of input variable where the effect of renewable energy on economic growth may vary depending on the levels of renewable energy, labor, and capital used in the production function.It is noticeable that the findings from the literature are mixed depending on the method used and country coverage.

However, different from the above papers, our panel threshold model can allow us to test whether there exists a threshold of renewable energy consumption where the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is different above and below this threshold.In the next section, we present our model specification.

For the OECD countries, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of the linear model. Hence the results for the OECD countries are not reported. The findings with respect to the OECD countries are consistent with the positive and linear relationship found between renewable energy consumption and economic growth by Apergis and Payne (2010) and Inglesi-Lotz (2016) for the OECD countries. Hence, the growth of renewable energy consumption in OECD countries leads to positive economic growth, and the effect of the growth of renewable energy consumption on economic growth does not change based on the amount of renewable energy consumed by the OECD countries (i.e., the relationship is linear). However, we obtain a significant threshold of renewable energy consumption level when all countries and non-OECD countries are used in the analysis (see the p-values reported in Table 8 where the null hypothesis of the linear relationship is rejected at the 1% level). The findings with the threshold model suggest that the growth of renewable energy consumption (i.e., Δ𝑙𝑛𝑅𝐸𝐶 𝑖𝑡 ) significantly and positively affects economic growth if and only if countries use a renewable energy above a given threshold level (i.e., when ln(REC) is above 9.5058 and 9.5926 for the whole sample and non-OECD countries, respectively). If countries use renewable energy below these threshold levels, the effect of the growth of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is insignificant, which is similar to the findings obtained from the linear estimations.

        <p>Beyond the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, there are also other important findings highlighting the complementary effect of inputs on each other.

However, this effect is significantly larger if countries surpass the threshold of renewable energy consumption levels (see the coefficients obtained for Δ𝐿𝑛𝐾 𝑖𝑡 with the linear model and threshold models in Tables 7 and8, respectively). On the other hand, labour growth (Δ𝐿𝑛𝐿 𝑖𝑡 ) has no significant effect on economic growth for non-OECD countries (see Table 7), but it has a significant effect on economic growth if countries use lower levels of renewable energy (see Table 8). In other words, the level of renewable energy consumption not only determines the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth but also plays an important role in the effect of other input variables on economic growth.Beyond the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, there are also other important findings highlighting the complementary effect of inputs on each other.

        <p>Similar to the previous subsections, we checked for the presence of cross-sectional dependence by using the cross-section dependence test of Pesaran (2004). The results suggest that the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence is strongly rejected for all the variables considered at the 1% significance level for both samples of countries (see Appendix Table A2 for the cross-sectional dependence test results). When we examine the levels of the variables, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of the unit root at the 10% significance level for all samples used but the null hypothesis of non-stationarity can be rejected at the 10% significance level for all of the variables when we use first differences (see Appendix Table A3 for the CIPS unit root test results when developing and developed country samples are used). Hence, based on the results, we find that the variables are non-stationary in the levels and stationary in the first-order differences for the developing and developed country samples. Finally, when we use the cointegration tests proposed by Westerlund (2007), one of the four test statistics rejects the null of no cointegration at the 10% level for developing and developed countries suggesting that there exists a long-run cointegration between the variables considered in the model.Similar to the previous subsections, we checked for the presence of cross-sectional dependence by using the cross-section dependence test of Pesaran (2004). The results suggest that the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence is strongly rejected for all the variables considered at the 1% significance level for both samples of countries (see Appendix Table A2 for the cross-sectional dependence test results).

        <p>Based on the initial set of results, to compare the findings based on the linear estimations and estimations with the threshold model, we carried out estimations based on Eq. ( 4) and ( 7), respectively, and the results obtained with the linear and threshold estimations are reported in Tables 9 and10, respectively. We find that the growth of renewable energy consumption is not a significant determinant of economic growth when linear estimation methods are used both for developed and developing countries. However, when we use the threshold estimation methods, we reject the linearity hypothesis at the 5% and 1% level for developed and developing country samples, respectively (see the p-value of SupWald test in Table 10). With the developed countries sample, we find that the findings are in line with the linear estimation methods where the effect of the growth of renewable energy growth on economic growth is not significant. In other words, irrespective of the linear or threshold models used, the renewable energy growth does not affect economic growth significantly, which is in line with the findings of the Menegaki (2011) for 27 European countries, Omri et al. (2015) for Finland, and Switzerland; Chang et al. (2015) for Canada, Italy and the USA. The potential explanation of this insignificant effect could be the fact that costs of developing renewable energy sources are created by public policies which may raise the final cost of energy, assuming that regulators include these costs in the final price of electricity (Marques and Fuinhas, 2012). On the other hand, we find that the growth of renewable energy consumption negatively and significantly affects the economic growth if countries use renewable energy below the threshold level (i.e., ln(REC) &lt; 9.6054), but the effect of growth of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is positive and significant if countries use renewable energy above the threshold level (i.e., ln(REC) &gt; 9.6054). This finding provides an explanation of why some of the literature obtained a negative effect for some countries (e.g., Ocal and Aslan, 2013;Marques and Fuinhas, 2012;Bhattacharya et al., 2016). If countries use renewable energy below the threshold level, they experience lower economic growth due to high up-front investment costs and capacity storage problems of renewable energy sources. However, if developing countries reach a threshold of renewable energy consumption, then they start to benefit from decreased costs of renewable energy consumption, and the effect of the growth of renewable energy consumption on economic growth becomes significant. In other words, our analysis provides an explanation of why two different strands of literature found contradicting results (i.e., the literature that found a positive and negative effect of renewable energy on economic growth).Based on the initial set of results, to compare the findings based on the linear estimations and estimations with the threshold model, we carried out estimations based on Eq.

        <p>Recently, traditional energy sources (petrol, coal and natural gas) are being replaced with renewable energy sources. In this context, this paper empirically examines whether there is any non-linear relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth when we employ a threshold model and use renewable energy consumption as the threshold variable. The linear models only identify a positive relationship between renewable energy and economic growth for OECD countries. Linear models suggest that there is no significant effect of the growth of renewable energy growth on economic growth for non-OECD and developing countries. However, with the threshold models, non-OECD and developing countries would benefit significantly from investing in renewable energy sources as long as their use of renewable energy surpasses a certain threshold. For developing countries, the growth of renewable energy has a negative effect on economic growth if they use relatively lower levels of renewable energy. Our findings highlight that developing countries that use relatively lower levels of renewable energy are not doomed to suffer from negative economic growth if they increase their renewable energy consumption as they can start enjoying the economic benefits of renewable energy growth after surpassing a certain threshold of renewable energy. In other words, the negative effect of renewable energy usage at initial levels could be compensated in the long term when these countries start using higher levels of renewable energy.Recently, traditional energy sources (petrol, coal and natural gas) are being replaced with renewable energy sources.

        <p>The recent literature highlighted the importance of better governance (Cadoret and Padovano, 2016) and energy market liberalization (Nicolli and Vona, 2019) for renewable energy deployment. Our results may further motivate such direction given the importance of renewable energy consumption for economic growth with the increased levels of renewable energy consumption even though the initial investments may have a negative effect on economic growth for developing countries.The recent literature highlighted the importance of better governance (Cadoret and Padovano, 2016) and energy market liberalization (Nicolli and Vona, 2019) for renewable energy deployment.
