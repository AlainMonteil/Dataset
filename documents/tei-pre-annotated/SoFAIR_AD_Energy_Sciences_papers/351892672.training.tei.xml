        <p>The size and the complexity of photovoltaic solar power plants are increasing, and it requires an advanced and robust condition monitoring systems for ensuring their reliability. This paper proposes a novel method for faults detection in photovoltaic panels employing a thermographic camera embedded in an unmanned aerial vehicle. The large amount of data generated by these systems must be processed and analyzed. This paper presents a novel approach to identify panels to detect hot spots, and to set their locations. Two novels region-based convolutional neural networks are unified to generate a robust detection structure. The main contribution is the combination of thermography and telemetry data to provide a response of the panel condition monitoring. The data are acquired and then automatically processed, allowing fault detection during the inspection. A detailed description of the methodology is presented, including the different stages to build the neural networks, i.e. the training process, the acquisition and processing of data and the outcomes generation. A thermographic inspection of a real photovoltaic solar plant is done to validate the proposed methodology. The accuracy, the efficiency and the performance of the approach under different real scenarios are evaluated statistically obtaining satisfactory results.The size and the complexity of photovoltaic solar power plants are increasing, and it requires an advanced and robust condition monitoring systems for ensuring their reliability.

        <p>Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation has been growing exponentially during the last decade. The global installed capacity has increased from 14 GWp in 2008 to more than 385 GWp in 2017 [1], i.e. a mean annual increase of 28% during the last ten years.Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation has been growing exponentially during the last decade. The global installed capacity has increased from 14 GWp in 2008 to more than 385 GWp in 2017 [1], i.e. a mean annual increase of 28% during the last ten years.</p>
        <p>The installed capacity increased due to two main reasons: the extent of modern PV solar power plants is larger than before [2], covering areas with thousands of square meters, and; modern PV solar panels are more efficient, increasing the energy production [3,4]. For example, in 2008, the world largest PV solar plant was "Olmedilla PV Park" (Spain), with a capacity of 60 MW spread over 285 ha [5], whereas in 2017, it is "Shakti Sthala" (India), 2,000 MWp spread over 5,261 ha [6]. The difference of installed capacity between both plants is more than 1,940 MWp, being the extension of the newer plant more than 18 times greater. Consequently, sophisticated systems require complex maintenance and operation (O&amp;M) tasks [7,8], e.g. panel cleaning, lubrication, repairs and general inspections [9]. The O&amp;M annually costs are estimated to be about 11.27 €/kWp in a ground installation [10], being the costs associated to planned inspection and monitoring around 1.47 €/kWp. Efficient methodologies and tools are needed to reduce the O&amp;M costs and to improve the availability of the PV solar plants [11][12][13]. These approaches can facilitate both corrective and preventive maintenance [14][15][16][17].The installed capacity increased due to two main reasons: the extent of modern PV solar power plants is larger than before [2], covering areas with thousands of square meters, and; modern PV solar panels are more efficient, increasing the energy production [3,4].

        <p>The thermographic camera captures the infrared energy emitted by the objects [11]. The UAV allows thermal data to be acquired from better locations [23,24]. Hereinafter, the system composed of the UAV and the IR camera will be named as IR-UAV system.

        <p>-The paper proposes a combination of thermography, GPS positioning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for fault detection in PV solar panels. Several authors have employed some of these techniques but not all techniques together. For example, Acciani et al. proposed a generic analysis of PVs using thermography [26,27], concluding that dirt can be identified as dark regions in thermal images. J. Muñoz et al. studied the risk of hot spots, that can cause irreversible damage in modules, appearing in PV solar cells and also in resistive solder bonds [28]. M. Aghaei et al. studied the applications of UAVs in PV solar plants maintenance [29]. They performed two experiments: the UAV flew for 5 minutes and monitored some panels in a roof; the second flight was in a PV solar plant. This inspection method had some limitations due to is was a visual method and image processing was not included. However, they confirm that UAVs result an efficient, cheap and reliable inspection tool. Kim et al. developed a method for detecting failures automatically in PV modules. They employed an UAV equipped with thermographic camera [30]. They obtained the panel area with their own algorithm and created an intensity histogram for each panel [31]. The automatic detection method was a pattern recognition based on histograms and statistical characteristics between good and defective panels. Unlike the method presented in this paper, they did not employ telemetry or GPS data to determine the location of the faults. -The method allows to detect and located faults automatically. Literature shows similar techniques to locate faults. For example, Tsanakas et al. elaborated an advanced inspection system based in UAVs and thermal images [32]. They developed a technique with true orthophoto mapping, based on aerial triangulation and also GPS techniques. They concluded that GPS was more effective than aerial triangulation, especially in large areas. However, this method is not an automatic detection process. -This work employs artificial intelligence to detect faults in PV panels. Similar works can be found in the literature [33], however, they do not combine the region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) and telemetry data. Thermography in PV solar panels has been developed on laboratories to study or identify hot spots, or cracked silicon wafers [28,34]. ANN based methods, in particular R-CNN, are often used to the object detection and classification in images [35], even real-time object detection [36]. Some authors use pretrained networks suitable to current object detection, e.g. AlexNet or GoogleNet [37]. However, they cannot detect relative hot regions since they are not a common object. This tool is also employed in the automotive sector to detect signals [38], vehicles or pedestrian [39]; in medicine to detect tumours [40] or face detection [41]; and in manufacturing industry for process automation [42]. Regarding the positioning system, a similar technique can be found in reference [43], where the positioning of the UAV is improved by integrating a GPS/INS/Vision sensors (INS: inertial navigation systems). However, this positioning system is not integrated in a R-CNN. -The method is validated and applied in real PV solar plants. Most of the works about thermography inspection of PV solar panels focus on the analysis of individual panels. In those works, different methods were applied to demonstrate the capabilities of thermography, for example, studying the efficiency of the panel [26], detecting relative hot regions in panels [44] or identifying general faults in PV modules [45].

        <p>SoftMax layer [65]: It is used as a classifier. The probabilities of each class are calculated with a confidence level. The SoftMax model is often considered as a part of the fully connected layer. The advantage of using SoftMax is that the sum of the output vector is 1 and there are not negative values, therefore, each component can be considered the probability of each class. The same vector could be also obtained by employing the Sigmoid function when the number of output classes is 2. The SoftMax model is a generalization of the sigmoid function for multiclass prediction. The use of SoftMax would allow to the ANN to be improved in case that more classes, such as specific faults, need to be predicted. Each node of this layer receives the information from all the nodes of the previous layer. The total input of the SoftMax layer (𝑎 𝑖 ) is given by equation (6).SoftMax layer [65]: It is used as a classifier. The probabilities of each class are calculated with a confidence level. The SoftMax model is often considered as a part of the fully connected layer. The advantage of using SoftMax is that the sum of the output vector is 1 and there are not negative values, therefore, each component can be considered the probability of each class. The same vector could be also obtained by employing the Sigmoid function when the number of output classes is 2.

        <p>This section describes novel methodology for detecting and locating relative hot regions. The algorithm is divided into three main stages: a R-CNN based structure is created and trained by using real image of solar panels; the R-CNN is employed for processing new data from the IR-UAV system, and; the results are summarized in a report, considering both telemetric and thermal information. Figure 6 shows the flowchart of the method. -Learn rate drop period: is applied to the learn rate schedule and defines the period of epochs to apply previous factor. -Max epochs: 15 epochs have been found as the optimal. The number of epochs determines the number of times that the training algorithm is applied to the whole training dataset. The time required by the training process depends on this parameter. -Mini batch size: adjusts the batch size. With a batch size of 16, optimal results have been obtained. This batch is a subset of the training image set. The SGD algorithm uses the parameter mini batch size as a parameter to evaluate the gradient at each iteration. A gradient clipping stabilizes the higher training learning rates in case of exponential increasing of the gradient.This section describes novel methodology for detecting and locating relative hot regions.

        <p>The selection of both the batch size and the max epochs has been done by iterating the algorithm with different values. Figure 8 shows that a higher max epochs number reduces the error, however the computational time increase. Similar results can be found in reference [70]. It can be observed that the error become stable from 15 epoch. Figure 9 shows the computational time required by the algorithm to complete the image processing for different batch sizes and 15 max. epochs. In this case study, the computational cost decreases for higher batch sizes. Therefore, a batch size of 16 is selected instead of 8. These parameter selection leads to reduce the computational cost without an excessive loss of accuracy.

        <p>The R-CNN provides better results if the edges of the PV solar panels are perpendicular to the edges of the images because of the ROIs are square. Therefore, it is convenient to orientate the image to improve the detection task. For this purpose, a code has been developed using an edge detection algorithm. It is based on derivative approximation method [75], developed through the Sobel model. The bounds are considered to be the points where the gradient is maximum. The edges of the images are detected using this information, and the algorithm is able to find the predominant directions to rotate the image. Figure 11 shows, from left to right, the different steps of the image rotation process. The detection algorithm is developed to assign a score to each boundary box and a confidence scores to each detected object. Only those results with a high confidence (more than 0.9) will be considered in this paper. The final stage of the approach is to associate the telemetry data and the outcomes in case that any relative hot region has been detected.The R-CNN provides better results if the edges of the PV solar panels are perpendicular to the edges of the images because of the ROIs are square.

        <p>The specifications show that the GPS in the flight controller has ±0.5 m vertical error and ±1.5 m horizontal error [77]. According to the gimbal specifications, the zenithal and azimuthal angles can have an error margin of 0.005º [78]. Considering a maximum altitude of 50 m, and a minimum zenithal angle of 30º, the maximum error introduced in the location is estimated to 1.8 m. The validation of the localization method has been done by using a thermal IR camera with a GPS. The validation process consisted in the manual checking of all the relative hot spots locations that were predicted by the proposed algorithm. This process is divided in three steps for each predicted hot spot: first, the location predicted by the algorithm is found using the manual GPS; second, the location of the nearest hotspot is registered, and; third, the distance between both locations is evaluated. The absolute distances obtained are shown in Figure 19. In this case study, an average error of 0.86 m has been achieved and all the errors were below to the estimated threshold of 1.8 m (minimal distance to classify a solar tracker). The solar trackers are longer than this threshold, and there is also space between them, therefore, the localization is done correctly. Due to the positioning error, this methodology does not guarantee the correct localization of the faulty PV panel, but the corresponding solar tracker is identified. This error is not a significative drawback, since all the detected anomalies must be checked manually before doing any repairment or replacement. Therefore, the coordinates of the affected PV trackers are enough to help the operators search for faulty panels.The specifications show that the GPS in the flight controller has ±0.5 m vertical error and ±1.5 m horizontal error [77].
