        <p>Employing fluorescent hydrogels for hazardous Hg(II) detection and removal is an efficient method for water purification. However, it remains challenging to establish a fluorescent system with low detection limit and high adsorption capacity that can readily be upcycled into a valuable material resource. Herein, we report on a fluorescent hydrogel with 0D sulfydryl-based carbon dots that are self-assembled with a 3D hydrogel network. The cellulose-based hydrogel exhibited good sensitivity for the detection of Hg(II) over a range from 0 to 40 µM with a limit detection of 3.0×10 -6 M.</p>
        <p>The adsorption experiments confirmed that the cellulose-based hydrogel exhibits good Hg(II) extraction capacity of over 662.25 mg g -1 at room temperature, and can effectively reduce the Hg concentration to attain acceptable levels that comply with industrial water standards (0.05 mg L -1 ). Subsequently, we used a facile strategy to convert the exhausted waste adsorbent by in-situ sulfurization into a suitable material for solar steam generation. The as-prepared upcycled aerogel evaporators exhibited excellent evaporation rates of ~1.30 kg m -2 h -1 under one sun irradiation. These results not only provide a strategy for heavy metal ion recognition and adsorption, but also provide a route to recycle hazardous waste for seawater desalination.</p>
        <p>As heavy metal pollution intensifies, it poses a significant threat to the environment and as such can harm human beings. [1][2][3] For example, mercury ions (Hg(II)) are hazardous heavy metal ions that are discharged as effluents by many industrial processes including mining, textiles, and leather production etc. [4,5] Over exposure to Hg(II) in drinking water can result in serious damage to human organs such as the kidney, liver and lungs. [6][7][8] Therefore, sensitive and effective detection and removal of heavy metal ions from wastewater is urgently required. Amongst the various sensing and purification technologies available, fluorescent hydrogels have drawn much attention due to the low cost, ease of operation and high efficiency.</p>
        <p>Among various fluorescent sensing materials, fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as nano sensors for applications in heavy metal ion detection owing to the excellent water solubility, non-toxicity, photostability and easy functionalization. [9][10][11][12] Thus, CDs with a high sensitivity and selectivity toward Hg(II) ions can be used as a sensing moiety during the preparation of fluorescent hydrogels. In addition, the zerodimensional structure of nano CDs helps their self-assembly within the threedimensional network of the hydrogel, which can increase the number of chelating sites and facilitate capture of Hg(II) ions, thus promoting the sensitivity and adsorption capacities of the material. Cellulose based hydrogels have been widely used for water purification via adsorption due to the high adsorption ability, 3D porous structure and abundance of modifiable and potentially ligating functional groups. For example, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) provides not only the skeleton of the hydrogel resulting in a 3D porous structure but also provide many chelating sites for heavy metal ion binding. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few literature examples of fluorescent hydrogels for both the recognition and adsorption of Hg(II) ions. Therefore, carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel (CMH) could be used as a scaffold and CDs used as fluorescence based units for the preparation of a fluorescent hydrogel capable of the detection and removal of Hg(II) ions with low detection limit and high adsorption capacities.</p>
        <p>The above fluorescent hydrogels could be extensively used for the treatment of heavy metal polluted water. However, the increasing demand for water treatment has led to a rapid generation of abundant end-of-life absorbents owing to their limited life cycle. [13] Most of the polymeric adsorbents eventually end up in landfills, which is wasteful, unsustainable, and costly. Therefore, to minimize the undesired environmental impact and promote sustainable development, a facile way to upcycle the exhausted materials into valuable products instead of just contributing to already overwhelmed landfills is urgently needed. [14] As such, this problem has motivated the development of methods to ensure the reuse of such hazardous materials to produce freshwater. One approach taken to reuse the materials is the use of solar-to-thermal technology. [15][16][17][18] Solar energy has been extensively explored due to its abundant, renewable, and environmentally-friendly properties. [19,20] Based on the 3D porous structure of the hydrogel, the mercury saturated adsorbents can be sulfurized in situ and used as part of photothermal materials. The 3D hydrogel nanostructure improves the efficiency of photothermal and solar energy conversion by reducing the heat loss caused by the localization of heat at the air-water interface during the heat transfer process. [21,22] Thus, these materials can then be exploited to absorb solar radiation and generate heat for water desalination. Such usage models provide significant advantages for both the fundamental aspects involved in the reuse of hazardous waste and practical applications for solar-driven water purification and power generation technologies.</p>
        <p>Herein, we report an approach to introduce sulfydryl-based carbon dots (CDs-SH) onto a functionalized cellulosed-based hydrogel through hydrogen bonding for the detection and removal of Hg(II) ions from wastewater (Scheme 1). The prepared CDs-SH exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity for Hg(II) due to the specific coordination between Hg(II) and -SH. [23,24] The CDs-SH were then used as the fluorescent part of the hydrogel sensor to rapidly detect and remove Hg(II) and the mechanism of the quenching phenomenon and adsorption ability was investigated.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the exhausted materials were vulcanized and then used for solar steam generation to generate freshwater. This strategy presents great opportunities for preparing multifunctional materials to purify heavy metal ions as well as to upcycle hazardous waste into value-added resources. Scheme 1. Schematic illustration of the preparation of CMH-CDs-SH and the detection and removal of Hg(II) ions.</p>
        <p>The chemicals used are as follows:</p>
        <p>Fluorescence spectra were measured using a F97Pro fluorescence spectrophotometer. AFS 933 atomic fluorescence spectrometer was used for measuring the concentration of Hg(II) ions. The Cu(II) ions and Cd(II) ions were determined using a AA-6800 flame atomic absorption spectrometer. The UV-Vis is absorption spectra for the samples were collected using a T6 New Century ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer.</p>
        <p>CDs are prepared by hydrothermal and microwave reaction. Sodium citrate (1 g) and glutathione (0.1 g) were added to DI water (30 mL) with stirring, and sonication for 30 min to produce a homogeneous solution. Finally, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (100 mL) and heated at 200 ℃ for 4 h. The autoclave was then cooled to 20 °C and the mixture was heated using a 600 W domestic microwave oven for 4 min. The resultant mixture was then filtered using a 0.1 mm filter to remove large particles resulting in a purified CD solution. Finally, the purified yellow solution was dried using a freeze dryer to obtain CD powder.</p>
        <p>CMH-CDs-SH: MBA (0.04 g) and CMC (0.263 g) were dissolved in AA (3.8 mL) and 1.0 wt% NaOH solution (11.0 mL), and then sonicated for 1 h. Subsequently, PPS (0.2 g) was added, and the solution was incubated in a water bath at 65 ℃ for 2 h to obtain CMH hydrogel. Finally, the synthetic cellulose hydrogel was immersed in CDs-SH solution (1 g/L). After 24 h, it was washed 3 times with DI water to obtain fluorescent hydrogel CMH-CDs-SH. The fluorescent hydrogel CMH-CDs-SH was then freeze-dried for the adsorption experiments.</p>
        <p>Acrylic acid hydrogel (AAH): MBA (0.04 g) and AA (3.8 mL) were dissolved in 1.0 wt% NaOH solution (11.0 mL). Then, PPS was added to the solution after sonication for 1 h. Finally, the mixed solution was stirred at 65 ℃ for 2 h to obtain the AAH.</p>
        <p>Scanning electron microscopy (HitachiS-4800 SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100) were used to investigate the morphology and nanostructure of the as prepared cellulose hydrogel. JEM 2100F transmission electron microscope was employed to determine the transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained on Thermo Electron Nicolet iZ10 over a range of 4500-400 cm -1 . The morphology of the samples was determined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi-s4800). The surface elemental composition of the aerogel was characterized using a Thermo Scientific Ultra Dry SDD Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDS). The elemental compositions for the samples were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer.</p>
        <p>A F97Pro fluorescence spectrophotometer was used for measurement. 25 µg/mL of CDs-SH was prepared in water. A series of metal ions including Hg(II), Cu(II), Cr(III), Fe(III), Al(III), Ni(II), Pb(II), and Cd(II) were placed into the CDs-SH solution for selective analysis. For the fluorescence spectra of the cellulose gel, a gel slice with deionized water (2 mL) was placed into the quartz cuvette. Then 0-40 µM of Hg(II) solution was added and the fluorescence behavior was then monitored.</p>
        <p>Batch adsorption experiments were used to explore the adsorption properties of Hg(II) with the fluorescent hydrogel. The adsorption process was performed by adding 10 mg of the freeze-dried hydrogel into 10 mL of mercury solution (100 mg mL -1 ) with shaking for 2 h at 293 K in a thermostatic shaker bath. [25] All Hg(II) ion solutions in the article are prepared by dissolving mercury acetate in DI water. The Hg(II) concentration was measured by a AFS 933 atomic fluorescence spectrometer. The adsorption efficiency (η) and equilibrium adsorption capacity (Qe) were determined using equations ( 1) and ( 2):</p>
        <p>Where C0 is the initial concentration of the Hg(II) solution (mg L -1 ), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the Hg(II) solution (mg L -1 ), V and m are the volume of the solution (L) and the weight of the freeze-dried CMH-CDs-SH (g), respectively.</p>
        <p>To study the adsorption mechanism, the pseudo-first-order (Eq. 3) and pseudosecond-order models (Eq. 4) [26] were used to analyze and describe the experimental data, the equations of which are expressed as follows:</p>
        <p>In which Qe and Qt (mg g -1 ) are the adsorbed amounts of Hg(II) on the cellulose gel at equilibrium and time (min); and k1 (min -1 ) and k2 (g (mg min) -1 ) represent the rate constant of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models, respectively.</p>
        <p>The adsorption isotherms were used to investigate the adsorption performance between Hg(II) and CMH-CDs-SH. [27,28] The formulas of the Langmuir (Eq. 5) and</p>
        <p>Freundlich models (Eq. 6) are described as follows:</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>In which Qe and Qm (mg g -1 ) represent the adsorbed amount of Hg(II) on the cellulose gel at equilibrium and the maximum adsorption capacity; Ce (mg L -1 ) represents the equilibrium concentration of Hg(II); KL and KF are the Langmuir and Freundlich constants, respectively; n is the Freundlich empirical parameter.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the thermodynamic properties between the Hg(II) and CMD-CDs-SH, adsorption experiments were carried out at 293, 313 and 333 K. The thermodynamic values of △G, △H and △S for the adsorption of Hg(II) on the adsorbents were calculated according to the van't Hoff equation:</p>
        <p>In which Kc (mL g -1 ) is the partition coefficient; Ca (mg g -1 ) and Ce (mg L -1 ) represent the adsorbed amount of Hg(II) on the cellulose gel and the equilibrium concentration of Hg(II), respectively; T is the temperature; R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol -1 K -1 );</p>
        <p>△G (kJ mol -foot_0 ), △H (kJ mol -1 ) and △S (J K -1 mol -1 ) are the Gibbs free energy changes, enthalpy change and entropy change, respectively.</p>
        <p>10 mg of CMH-CDs-SH was placed in a plastic centrifuge tube, including a mixed solution of two metal ions (10 mL), a mixed solution of Hg(II)/Cu(II) and Hg(II)/Cd(II)</p>
        <p>in the range of 10-1000 mg L -1 . The plastic centrifuge tube was then shaken for 3 h at 293 K and the metal ion solution was collected for subsequent tests. There are three types of effects in the multi-component system: synergy (Qmix/Q0&gt;1), antagonism (Qmix/Q0&lt;1) and non-interaction (Qmix/Q0=1). [29] The interaction between the two components in the binary mixture can be derived from the ratio of the Q0 of a single component to the Qmix of the single component in the binary component.</p>
        <p>A competitive Langmuir model [Eq. ( 11)] [30][31][32] was used to analyze the data obtained in the binary system. Eq. ( 11) can also be rearranged into the following equation Eq. ( 12) and then arranged into a binary system. The equilibrium adsorption data were validated using the Marquardt percentage standard deviation (MPSD) according to the following Eq. (13).</p>
        <p>Where, Ce, i is the equilibrium concentration of the i-th metal ion (mg L -1 ), and KL,i is the adsorption constant (L mg -1 ). Q i,e cal is the experimental adsorption capacity (mg g - experiments and P is the number of parameters in the model.</p>
        <p>10 mg of CMH-CDs-SH was placed in to a 10 mL mixed solution containing Hg(II), Cu(II) and Cd(II)ions with a varying range of 10-200 mg L -1 , respectively. The mixture was shaken for 120 min at 293 K and collected for the subsequent testing.</p>
        <p>20 mg of CMH-CDs-SH was added to 20 mL of Hg(II) solution (100 mg L -1 ) at 293 K for 120 min. Then the Hg(II)-loaded hydrogel was regenerated by immersing the adsorbent in 20 mL of HCl solution (1.0 mol L -1 ) and shaking at room temperature for 720 min. The regenerated hydrogel was used in another cycle after washing with DI water until a neutral pH was achieved</p>
        <p>Initially, CMH-CDs-SH was used to adsorb Hg(II) (1000 mg L -1 ) ions for 12 h at room temperature. After being taken out from the solution, the Hg(II) ion-loaded gel was washed with deionized water to remove any non-absorbed Hg(II) ions. Then, the remaining adsorbent was immersed in Na2S solution for 12 h. Based the adsorption capacity of Hg(II) by CMH-CDs-SH, the molar ratios of mercury ions absorbed on the adsorbents to sulfur were 1:1; 1:2; 2:1.Finally, the gel was treated with distilled water to reach a neutral pH, and then dried in a freeze-drying oven to obtain the S-loaded aerogel.</p>
        <p>The water evaporation experiments of CMH-HgSx were performed in a crystallizing dish (100 mL) with 70 mL of distilled water and then irradiated under a solar simulator with 100 mW cm -2 at room temperature and a humidity of about 50%. During the experiment, the mass changes of the system was measured on an electronic balance.</p>
        <p>Temperature changes were monitored in real time by an infrared camera. The energy efficiency (η) can be obtained according to Eq. ( 14) below. [33]</p>
        <p>Where m is the mass flux under steady-state conditions; h V is the enthalpy of evaporation of water in the sample (2444 J g -1 ). Copt represents the optical concentration and qi represents the solar irradiation power on the adsorber surface (100 mW cm -2 ). eV, which could be attributed to the C-N and N-H. While the O1s, the peaks at 530.4</p>
        <p>and 531.7 eV could be attributed to the C=O and C-O respectively. For the S2p, the peak at161.2eV could be attributed to S-H, the XPS results further confirmed that the existence of -SH on the CDs-SH. [36,37] Subsequently, the fluorescent hydrogel was prepared via immersing cellulose-based hydrogel (CMH) with CDs-SH facilitated by hydrogen bond driven assembly (Fig. 1e). CMH provides a natural skeleton and results in a 3D porous network structure to provide a channel for the transmission of heavy metal ions. Then it is soaked with CDs-SH solution to generate a fluorescent hydrogel (CMH-CDs-SH). CDs-SH can be not only used as a fluorescent sensor, but also provides binding sites for Hg(II) ions. The sulfhydryl groups on the surface of the CDs can provide a large quantity of available binding sites for chelation with Hg(II). [38,39] As shown in Fig. S1, it can be seen from the EDS diagram that homogeneous C, O, N and S elements exist in the CMH-CDs-SH, which also indicated that the CDs-SH are uniformly dispersed throughout the hydrogel. SEM was used to determine the morphology of the acrylic acid hydrogel (AAH) (Fig. 1f,g) and CMH-CDs-SH (Fig. 1i,j). Both AAH and CMH-CDs-SH exhibit a 3D porous network structure. These 3D network structures can increase ion migration speeds and enhance adsorption capacity. [25] The pore size distribution desorption-desorption isotherms (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda) indicated that the average pore size of the CMH with or without CD loading was nearly the same (Fig. 1h). This result confirmed that CDs did not change the pore size of the CMH. Compared with AAH, CMH-CDs-SH exhibited a higher surface area (4.59 m 2 g -1 ), pore volume (0.0274 cm 3 g -1 ) and average pore size (23.85 nm). Meanwhile, CMH-CDs-SH displayed an abundant mesoporous structure with pore diameter of 18 nm, which could promote adsorption of metal ions due to abundance of active sites dispersed throughout the CMH-CDs-SH, thus improving the adsorption ability. [40,41] The XRD pattern of CDs-SH (Fig. S2) shows that the peak value is at about 31°, indicating that the prepared CDs are mainly amorphous carbon atoms which is similar to graphene carbon nanomaterials. Through comparison between CMH and CMH-CDs-SH, it was found that CMH CDs-SH has an XRD peak at 31°, indicating that the CMH was successfully functionalized with CDs-SH. To explore the fluorescence properties of the CDs-SH and CMH-CDs-SH, UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of the CDs in aqueous solution were investigated (Fig. 2a). The prepared CDs-SH displays a UV-visible absorption band at 340 nm and a fluorescence emission peak at 450 nm. In addition, it was found that the CDs-SH exhibited blue fluorescence under a UV lamp. [42,43] Additionally, a solution of CDs-SH exhibited the most intense intensity at around 440 nm with excitation at 340 nm (Fig. 2b). In order to understand the Hg(II) recognition behavior, the fluorescence spectrum of CDs-SH upon the addition of Hg(II) was investigated. In the presence of Hg(II) ions, the fluorescence intensity of CDs-SH was significantly quenched (Fig. 2c).</p>
        <p>This quenching effect can be attributed to the affinity between Hg(II) and the functional groups, such as sulfhydryl groups on the surface of CDs-SH. [44] CDs-SH exhibited a linear relationship between the I0/I and the concentration of Hg(II) (0~15 µM), with a correlation coefficient of 0.975. Based on the Stern-Volmer formula, the quenching constant KSV was found to be 0.008. The limit detection for the CDs-SH for Hg(II) was determined to be 2.7×10 -7 mol L -1 according to the 3δ/k (where δ represents the standard deviation of the blank CDs-SH solution, and k represents the slope of the linear plot.). Furthermore, the selectivity of the CDs-SH was evaluated by the addition of different metal ions, and only Hg(II) exhibited a significant fluorescence decrease, while the other metal ions had little effect on the fluorescence of the CDs-SH. In contrast, in the presence of Hg(II) ions, the intensity ratio (I0/I) increased by 691.90%, indicating that CDs-SH has excellent selectivity for Hg(II) (Fig. S3). Meanwhile, inspired by the above fluorescence performance, the fluorescent hydrogel containing CDs-SH (CMH-CDs-SH) was prepared for the recognition and removal of Hg(II) ions.</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. S4, it can be seen that the CMH exhibits no fluorescence change with an increasing concentrations of Hg(II) ions. While, the emission intensity of the CMH-CDs-SH at about 440 nm decreases after addition of Hg(II) ions, indicating that the CDs-SH plays an important role in Hg(II) sensing (Fig. 2d). [45] When the Hg(II) ions Furthermore, we also evaluated the adsorption capacity of CMH-CDs-SH for Hg(II)</p>
        <p>to obtain the best conditions for removing Hg(II). First, the effect of pH on the adsorption capacity of CMH-CDs-SH was evaluated over a pH range from 1.0 to 6.0.</p>
        <p>As shown in Fig. S6, as the pH value increases, the adsorption capacity also increases, and reaches a maximum at pH 5.0. Therefore, the optimal pH conditions are around 5.0.</p>
        <p>To understand the adsorption mechanism, the influence of contact time and adsorption capacity was determined. The adsorption of Hg(II) by CMH-CDs-SH is rapid at first, then slows down, and finally reaches equilibrium after 1h. These results are used to fit the pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The linear fitting results and kinetic parameters are shown in Table S1, Fig. 3a insert and Fig. S7. Clearly, the adsorption of Hg(II) by CMH-CDs-SH fits a pseudo-second-order model (R 2 = 0.999). These results indicated that the adsorption mechanism of Hg(II) is mainly chemical adsorption.</p>
        <p>To further estimate the adsorption properties, the effect of temperature on the adsorption of CMH-CDs-SH was examined. As shown in Fig. 3b, with an increase of temperature, the adsorption capacity exhibited an obvious increasing trend (The maximum adsorption capacity increased from 662.25 mg g -1 to 1346.83 mg g -1 ),</p>
        <p>indicating that an increase of temperature is conducive to the adsorption of Hg(II).</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, this result can be also confirmed by the calculated thermodynamic parameters (Table S2), the △H is positive indicating that CMH-CDs-SH adsorption of Hg(II) is an endothermic process, while △S is negative, indicating that adsorption of Hg(II) is a spontaneous process. In addition, with an increase of temperature, the decrease of △G value indicated that a higher temperature is conducive to the adsorption of Hg(II), which is consistent with the experimental results.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the isotherm model. The dependence of CMH-CDs-SH on the concentration of a wide range of initial mercury ion concentrations was evaluated. The adsorption capacity of the CMH-CDs-SH increased with an increase of the initial Hg(II) concentration. In addition, compared to the cellulose-based hydrogel (CMH) at 293 K, the CMH-CDs-SH exhibited a slightly higher adsorption capacity, suggesting that the CDs promote the extraction efficiency of Hg(II) (Fig. S8). The fitting results of Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms for the CMH-CDs-SHs are shown in Similarly, the recyclability of the adsorbents is of great importance for environmental applications. To reveal the recyclability of the CMH-CDs-SH, CMH-CDs-SH regeneration was achieved by immersing the adsorbent in hydrochloric acid solution for 2 h. Fig. S10 shows that after four cycles of desorption, the adsorption efficiency of the CMH-CDs-SH for Hg(II) ranges from 98.8% to 88.3%, which indicates that the Hg(II) ion uptake ability of the CMH-CDs-SHs only slightly decreases in repeated adsorption-desorption cycles. Therefore, CMH-CDs-SH exhibits good recyclable properties and can be used for practical applications.</p>
        <p>Generally, industrial wastewater contains a variety of heavy metal ions at different concentrations. [48][49][50][51] Therefore, the development of multi-component adsorption materials is the key for effective water treatment technology. [52] In addition to the adsorption of Hg(II), CMH-CDs-SH was used to adsorb Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions. As shown in Fig. 3d, in a single system, the material exhibits good adsorption performance for Cu(II), Cd(II) and Hg(II), with adsorption capacities of 68.8, 89.0 and 182.8 mg•g - 1 , respectively. For the binary system, a two-component adsorption system consisting of Hg(II)-Cu(II) and Hg(II)-Cd(II) were evaluated, and the results were fitted using a Langmuir competition model. To further check the accuracy of the model, a comparison between the theoretical prediction and the experimental values are given in Fig. 3e. The MPSD values of the isotherm model range from 8 to 30 (Table S4). The results indicate that the Langmuir competition model is suitable for the binary system. From the calculated Qmix/Q0 value range from 0.381 to 0.831, it can be concluded that there is an antagonistic effect in the binary adsorption process. For the ternary system (Fig. 3f), with increase of the initial concentration, the adsorption capacity of the three ions shows an increasing trend. Compared with the single component system, CMH-CDs-SH has a lower adsorption capacity for these metal ions. These phenomena may be attributed to the occurrence of antagonism effects on the adsorbents. detection and removal in Table S5, CMH-CDs-SH exhibits better detection and removal capabilities. Furthermore, the exhausted materials can be vulcanized and then used for solar steam generation to generate freshwater, which provides a route to recycle hazardous waste for seawater desalination. The limited life cycle of fluorescent hydrogels, and the increasing demand for water treatment has led to the rapid production large amounts of exhausted absorbents as waste. Therefore, to promote sustainable development and to reduce environmental pollution, a facile way to upcycle the exhausted materials into valuable products is urgently required. One approach taken to reuse the materials is the use of solar-tothermal technology. CMH-CDs-SH not only exhibits good ability to remove various metal ions but provide an opportunity for use in solar steam power generation. First, the CMH-HgSx is synthesized by the vulcanization reaction between the saturated adsorbent containing Hg(II) ions and Na2S solution. As shown in Fig. 5a, the color of the CMH changed to black after the sulfurization process. The black CMH-HgSx can be used as a "solar absorber" to convert light into heat. Therefore, the material can be used to absorb solar radiation and generate heat for seawater desalination. [53] The binding states and quantitative chemical compositions of the CMH-HgSx samples were determined by XPS analyses. As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S6, the C1s exhibits two components related to N-C=O at 288.7 eV and C-N at 284.8 eV, which correspond to the oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing functional groups in the CMH-HgSx.</p>
        <p>For O1s, typical peaks at 532.7 and 531.3 eV are assigned as C=O and C-O. For N1s, the peaks at 398.9 and 401.2 eV on the CMH-HgSx are attributed to the C-N and -NH-. It was observed that the CMH-HgSx contains a large amount of S (8.14%) and Hg (10.39%), while CMH-CDs-SH/Hg(II) reveal much lower levels of S. This result showed that S was successfully incorporated into the CMH-HgSx. Meanwhile, double peaks corresponding to HgS were observed at 162.2 eV and 161.3 eV after in-situ vulcanization. These results confirmed that Na2S substances were used for the formation of HgS on CMH-HgSx (Fig. S11e). [54] As for the Hg4f peak (Fig. S11f), double peaks at 104.2 and 100.1 eV were designated as Hg-S, suggesting that HgS was the main Hg species within the CMH-HgSx. [55] Initially, the water evaporation rate of CMH-HgSx samples with different Hg/S ratios (molar ratios of mercury to sulfur: 1:1, 1:2, 2:1) were carried out under dark conditions to explore the effect on the evaporation rate of water. As shown in Fig. 5b, the evaporation rate under dark conditions was recorded under closed conditions with a temperature of 30 °C, ambient air pressure, and a relative humidity of ≈ 60%. The results indicated that the water evaporation rates of CMH-HgSx samples with different Hg/S ratios were almost the same, however higher than that of bulk water. Then the corresponding equivalent enthalpy is estimated according to the previously established formula, which indicates that CMH-HgSx reduce the energy cost of evaporation, and the best molar ratio is under the conditions of 1:1 (mercury to sulfur). The temperature changes of the CMH-HgSx with different Hg/S ratios were measured using an infrared camera under one sunlight irradiation (Fig. 5c andS12). The surface temperature of the CMH-Hg and CMH-HgSx (1:1) rapidly increased to 29.4°C and 51.0°C within 30 minutes, and then reached a steady state (Fig. 5d). CMH-HgSx exhibits a higher performance than CMH-Hg, which may be due to the better optical properties of black CMH-HgSx when compared with the light yellow CMH-Hg, CMH-HgSx accelerates the conversion of light into heat. [56] The result indicated that the CMH-HgSx has an excellent heat localization effect, which contributes to solar steam generation. Subsequently, the steam-generation efficiency of the CMH-Hg and CMH-HgSx (1:1, 1:2, 2:1) were calculated by measuring the weight of water evaporation against irradiation time under one sun illumination. From Fig. 5e, f, the water evaporation rate of CMH-HgSx (1:1) was 1.30 kg m -2 h -1 , which is a higher performance when compare to 0.67 kg m -2 h -1 for CMH-Hg. The corresponding energy efficiency of CMH-HgSx was calculated to be 88.3% under one sun illumination, and as such exhibit's great potential as a solar evaporator. In addition, we evaluated the water evaporation capacity of CMH-HgSx (1:1) by changing the intensity of incident sunlight (Fig. 5g). The water evaporation rates under different optical strengths (0.5-</p>
