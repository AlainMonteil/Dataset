        <p>In the last few decades, consumers' growing attention to the close relationship between health and nutrition is emerging as a new trend, mostly regarding the incorporation of natural ingredients into food. Among those ingredients, microalgae are considered as innovative and promising compounds, rich in valuable nutrients and bioactive molecules. In the present work, 3D printed cookies were fortified with the microalga Arthrospira platensis aiming at developing a new functional food with antioxidant properties. A. platensis antioxidants were recovered using ultrasound-assisted extraction in hydroalcoholic solutions. Ethanol/water and biomass/solvent ratios were optimised through a Design of Experiments (DOE) approach, using the antioxidant activity (ORAC and ABTS) and total phenolic content (TPC) as response variables. The highest ORAC, ABTS and TPC values were observed in the extract obtained with 0% ethanol and 2.0% biomass; thus, this extract was chosen to be incorporated into a printable cookie dough. Three different incorporation approaches were followed: (1) dried biomass, (2) freeze-dried antioxidant extract and (3) antioxidant extract encapsulated into alginate microbeads to enhance the stability to heat, light, and oxygen during baking and further storage. All dough formulations presented shape fidelity with the 3D model. The cookies had a w values low enough to be microbiologically stable, and the texture remained constant after 30 days of storage. Moreover, the extract encapsulation promoted an improvement in the ORAC value and colour stability when compared to all other formulations, revealing the potential of A. platensis for the development of a functional 3D food-ink.In the last few decades, consumers' growing attention to the close relationship between health and nutrition is emerging as a new trend, mostly regarding the incorporation of natural ingredients into food.

        <p>Many nutrition concepts have changed during the past few decades, and the food industry has made a significant effort to follow them and adapt their products to these changes. Traditionally, the primary role of diet was to provide enough nutrients to meet metabolic requirements while giving consumers a feeling of satisfaction and well-being. Nowadays, however, it is established that beyond meeting nutritional needs, the diet may modulate various bodily functions and may play detrimental or beneficial roles in some diseases (Bigliardi &amp; Galati, 2013;Roberfroid, 2000). In this regard, it is possible to observe an increasing consumer's health consciousness and demand for healthy foods -facts that are stimulating innovation and new product development in the food industry. This trend is also responsible for an ever-increasing worldwide interest in functional food, which also can be explained by the increasing cost of the health care and the steady boost of life expectancy (Betoret, Betoret, Vidal, &amp; Fito, 2011;Lopez-Rubio, Gavara, &amp; Lagaron, 2006;Plaza, Herrero, Cifuentes, &amp; Ib� anez, 2009;Sun, Zhou, Yan, Huang, &amp; Lin-ya, 2018).Many nutrition concepts have changed during the past few decades, and the food industry has made a significant effort to follow them and adapt their products to these changes.

        <p>Functional food is a natural or processed food that contains known biologically-active compounds which, when in defined quantitative and qualitative amounts, provide a clinically proven and documented health benefit; and, hence, a useful tool for the prevention, management and treatment of diseases. There is a wide range of compounds that have already been incorporated into functional foods, with particular attention being given to ingredients from natural resources (Day, Seymour, Pitts, Konczak, &amp; Lundin, 2009;Herrero, Martín-� Alvarez, Senor� ans, Cifuentes, &amp; Ib� anez, 2005).Functional food is a natural or processed food that contains known biologically-active compounds which, when in defined quantitative and qualitative amounts, provide a clinically proven and documented health benefit; and, hence, a useful tool for the prevention, management and treatment of diseases.

        <p>Microalgae can be considered an innovative and promising food ingredient, rich in nutrients such as high-value proteins, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds, as well as other bioactive molecules (Gouveia, Marques, Sousa, Moura, &amp; Bandarra, 2010). Among them, Arthrospira platensis is one of the main species exploited by the food and nutrition industries, being traditionally used as food by different cultures. This microorganism is a blue-green filamentous prokaryotic cyanobacterium well known for its unique composition, comprising not only up to 70% of protein containing all the essential amino acids, but also polysaccharides, vitamin B 12 , C, E, and γ-linolenic acid (GLA). Furthermore, it is a source of potent antioxidants, such as carotenoids, polyphenols and phycobiliproteins -a group of photosynthetic pigments majority represented by C-phycocyanin, which are related to numerous reported pharmacological properties; including anticancer, antidiabetes, hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory (Czerwonka et al., 2018;Da Silva, Fernandes, Barros, Fernandes, &amp; Jos� e, 2019;Hu, Fan, Qi, &amp; Zhang, 2019;Plaza, Herrero, Cifuentes, &amp; Ib� añez, 2009;Soni, Sudhakar, &amp; Rana, 2017).Microalgae can be considered an innovative and promising food ingredient, rich in nutrients such as high-value proteins, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals, and phenolic compounds, as well as other bioactive molecules (Gouveia, Marques, Sousa, Moura, &amp; Bandarra, 2010).

        <p>The incorporation of microalgae biomass into traditional foods (e.g. breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, cookies, gelled desserts, and beverages), which are primarily consumed on a daily basis, has been researched and several products have already been launched in the market (Gouveia et al., 2010;Lafarga, 2019). In particular, cookies are considered a convenient dense snack food, offering a valuable supplementation vehicle for nutritional improvement as they are widely accepted and consumed by all age groups. There is a trend for research and innovation in this market segment, which promotes the inclusion of healthy ingredients into cookies, such as antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, proteins and fibers (Batista et al., 2017;Nogueira &amp; Steel, 2018;� Saponjac et al., 2016).The incorporation of microalgae biomass into traditional foods (e.g. breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, cookies, gelled desserts, and beverages), which are primarily consumed on a daily basis, has been researched and several products have already been launched in the market (Gouveia et al., 2010;Lafarga, 2019).

        <p>Besides the change in consumer's attitudes towards a healthier diet, it is noteworthy that food ingredients and their nutritional needs vary among individuals, especially children, elderly and athletes (Tan, Toh, Wong, &amp; Li, 2018). This context motivates a growing market for personalized healthy nutrition, which aims to tailor food and diets specifically based on an individual's health condition. In light of this, three dimensional (3D) food printing has gained increasing attention for its distinctive potential to create complex geometric structures, enabling mass customisation while having economic and environmental benefits. The main advantage of this emerging technology is being able to personalize food by tailoring nutrition in a novel multi-flavoured, coloured and textured structure, allowing the incorporation of a broad range of ingredients (Dankar, Haddarah, Omar, Sepulcre, &amp; Pujol� a, 2018;Liu et al., 2018a;P� erez, Nykvist, Brøgger, Larsena, &amp; Falkeborg, 2019;Sun et al., 2018).Besides the change in consumer's attitudes towards a healthier diet, it is noteworthy that food ingredients and their nutritional needs vary among individuals, especially children, elderly and athletes (Tan, Toh, Wong, &amp; Li, 2018).

        <p>Considering the above mentioned, this study aimed at developing 3D printed functional cookies fortified with antioxidants extracted from A. platensis, to create a new functional food based on an innovative 3D food-ink. Due to the inherent instability of C-phycocyanin, carotenoids and other antioxidant compounds present in this microalga, the encapsulation of its extract in alginate microbeads was proposed as a way of improving the cookies stability to heat, light, and oxygen during the baking and further storage. Parameters such as colour, texture, water activity and antioxidant potential were investigated and compared with the freeze-dried extract and whole biomass incorporation into the cookie dough.Considering the above mentioned, this study aimed at developing 3D printed functional cookies fortified with antioxidants extracted from A. platensis, to create a new functional food based on an innovative 3D food-ink.

        <p>For a practical application in the food industry, antioxidants should be first extracted; however, the extraction process efficiency may affect its availability (Wardhani, V� asquez, &amp; Pandiella, 2010). Recently, ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) has been widely employed for the recovery of target compounds from many natural products due to its facilitated mass transfer between immiscible phases, through super agitation at low frequency. The enhanced extraction obtained by ultrasounds is mostly attributed to the acoustic cavitation produced in the solvent by the passage of an ultrasound wave. Moreover, UAE also exerts a mechanical effect, allowing greater penetration of solvent into the cell wall, increasing the contact surface area between the solid and liquid phase. As a result, the solute quickly diffuses from the solid phase to the solvent, increasing bioactive recovery when compared to conventional methods (Haque, Dutta, Thimmanagari, &amp; Chiang, 2016;Kurd &amp; Samavati, 2015;Liu, Wei, &amp; Liao, 2013;Zou, Jia, Li, Wang, &amp; Wu, 2013).For a practical application in the food industry, antioxidants should be first extracted; however, the extraction process efficiency may affect its availability (Wardhani, V� asquez, &amp; Pandiella, 2010).

        <p>Various parameters play a significant role in optimizing the experimental conditions for the development of an extraction method. Extraction time, temperature and the solid-to-liquid ratio are generally considered to be the most critical factors that affect bioactive recovery. The choice of an extracting solvent is also a crucial step towards extraction optimization; different solvents will yield different extract amounts and composition. In the present study, water and ethanol were employed as extraction solvents for the microalga A. platensis considering food application safety (Chaiklahan et al., 2013;Zou et al., 2013).Various parameters play a significant role in optimizing the experimental conditions for the development of an extraction method.

        <p>The recovery of antioxidant compounds from A. platensis biomass was optimised through a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach, using a 2 k full factorial design with 2 factors. The effect of ethanol/water and biomass/solvent ratios on the antioxidant activity (ORAC and ABTS) and total phenolic content (TPC) were analysed as response variables (see Table 1). All the response curves exhibited an excellent fitting (r 2 ¼ 0.99) and statistical significance. The response surfaces after 30 min and 1 h of ultrasound treatment are represented in Fig. 1. It is possible to notice that the phenolic content increased proportionally with the amount of microalga. Additionally, increasing the treatment time to 1 h promoted a higher phenolic content, which was also higher with increasing A. platensis content. Nevertheless, the recovery of phenolic compounds was more efficient at 0% ethanol independently of the time. The ABTS exhibited a similar trend; although in this case, the extraction time was crucial, being the antioxidant activity at 1 h more than 2.5-fold higher than at 30 min. The ORAC assay corroborated the ABTS results, pointing out that to obtain an extract with high antioxidant activity, the ultrasound treatment should be performed during 1 h with 2.0% biomass and 0% ethanol. After freeze-drying the liquid extract obtained in this condition, 0.4 g of dry antioxidant extract was obtained per gram of biomass.

        <p>Cookies quality is influenced by several factors, such as the quality and amount of ingredients used, processing conditions and moulding of the dough, as well as baking and cooling of the cookies. Among those factors, dough rheology is of considerable importance in cookies manufacture as it influences the dough machinability and the final sensorial characteristics. Doughs with extreme degrees of firmness or softness will not process satisfactorily on the dough forming equipment and will not yield adequate products (Manohar &amp; Rao, 2002).Cookies quality is influenced by several factors, such as the quality and amount of ingredients used, processing conditions and moulding of the dough, as well as baking and cooling of the cookies.

        <p>In this work, cookies were shaped through a 3D food printer, where the main physical properties involved can be divided into two categories: firstly the ones that affect the extruding process, which includes the flow behaviour and viscous modulus (G 00 ) of the dough; and secondly, the factors which influence the ability to support the three dimensional structure of the printed products or to maintain its shape and structure, such as the elastic modulus (G'), gel strength, among others (Yang, Zhang, Prakash, &amp; Liu, 2018).In this work, cookies were shaped through a 3D food printer, where the main physical properties involved can be divided into two categories: firstly the ones that affect the extruding process, which includes the flow behaviour and viscous modulus (G 00 ) of the dough; and secondly, the factors which influence the ability to support the three dimensional structure of the printed products or to maintain its shape and structure, such as the elastic modulus (G'), gel strength, among others (Yang, Zhang, Prakash, &amp; Liu, 2018).</p>
        <p>Initially, cookies doughs were characterized through a creeprecovery test and texture analysis. During the creep-recovery assay, a stress is applied for a specific interval, it is then removed, and the recovery is monitored for another period. This property provides information about the ability of the sheared and micro-extruded food-ink to recover; therefore, the faster the recovery, the higher shape fidelity should be expected. Likewise, less strain during the test indicates a stronger ability of the material to maintain the shape and structure of printed products; which, however, will also require higher extrusion rates (Yang, Zhang, Fang, &amp; Liu, 2019).Initially, cookies doughs were characterized through a creeprecovery test and texture analysis.

        <p>Fig. 2a shows the creep-recovery curves expressed by a compliance variation (J) as a function of time, which is the ratio of the deformation γ to the applied stress τ. Dough deformation could be used to characterize its strength, which means the harder the dough, the higher the amount of energy required to achieve the same deformation when compared with a softer dough. Accordingly, if a material has a high compliance, it will present low rigidity and high deformation or strain; and, consequently, better extrudability (Ahmed, 2015). The cookie dough incorporated with encapsulated extract showed higher maximal strain or compliance with the applied stress, while the one prepared with microalga biomass led to a more stiff dough (Table 3). The replacement of a small amount of flour by microalga biomass resulted in the inclusion of a complex biological ingredient, rich in proteins and polysaccharides. These molecules have an important role in the water absorption process, which promote the increase of dough firmness (Bolanho et al., 2014;Gouveia, Batista, Miranda, Empis, &amp; Raymundo, 2007;Gouveia et al., 2008). On the other hand, the encapsulated antioxidant extract dough led to an unstructured network due to the water molecules present among the calcium-alginate microbeads, resulting in a reduction of its viscosity. Furthermore, the addition of the free antioxidant extract did not change the dough behaviour, matching with the one observed for the control cookies.Fig. 2a shows the creep-recovery curves expressed by a compliance variation (J) as a function of time, which is the ratio of the deformation γ to the applied stress τ.

        <p>The creep and recovery stages were fitted to Burger's model (Eqs. ( 2) and (3), respectively) and results are shown in Table 3. The instantaneous elastic compliance (J 0C ), viscoelastic compliance (J 1C ) and the steady viscosity (μ 0 ) corroborated with Fig. 2a. Biomass cookie dough revealed high μ 0 and lower compliances, which means that the higher the steady-state viscosity, the higher the resistance to deformation. The opposite behaviour was observed for the encapsulated extract dough, which presented higher compliances and lower steady-state viscosity; therefore, less resistance to deformation.The creep and recovery stages were fitted to Burger's model (Eqs.

        <p>Contrastingly, retardation time (λ) did not show the same behaviour, and only the biomass and the encapsulated extract doughs were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05). However, this parameter agrees with the compliance results. The retardation time (λ) mainly indicates the time required for the sample strain to decay to the initial value at 1/e, and the less stiff dough (encapsulated extract) showed higher (λ). The recovery phase exhibited similar behaviour, with elastic compliance (J 0C ), viscoelastic compliance (J 1C ) and the steady viscosity (μ 0 ) following the same tendency. More stiff doughs take longer to deform, and also to recover their structure.

As it can be observed in Fig. 3, the biomass cookie dough showed higher hardness, which agrees with the creep-recovery results. Nevertheless, the dough incorporated with the free extract, which had similar rheological behaviour as the control, exhibited a low hardness value. This decrease of hardness could be attributed to the reduced flour mass and its substitution for components of the freeze-dried antioxidant extract. Those constituents may further bind with water molecules through hydrogen bonds, suppressing the water absorption and the gluten protein swelling. Consequently, the free extract dough displayed a lower network strength, comparable to the one with encapsulated extract (Liu, Liang, Saeed, Lan, &amp; Qin, 2019).Concerning the texture analysis, all doughs incorporated with different forms of A. platensis presented significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) when compared to the control.

        <p>The dough properties during the cooking process were evaluated through a temperature-sweep analysis and results revealed that the obtained profiles were consistent with that of the creep-recovery test. Fig. 2b andc show the viscoelastic properties (complex modulus and tan δ) against temperature increase. G* reflects both contribution of elastic (G 0 ) and viscous (G 00 ) moduli; while tan δ, which character prevail, is defined as G''/G'. In the mechanical spectra, tan δ was lower than 1 (G' &gt; G") for all temperatures, indicating that all doughs behave as a gellike material. The dough incorporated with A. platensis biomass exhibited higher G* values, as the biomass composition promotes a more structured network. Oppositely, the encapsulated extract dough presented lower G* values due to its reduced viscosity. Nonetheless, tan δ spectra did not show great differences, as the proportion between elastic and viscous moduli was similar for all formulations.The dough properties during the cooking process were evaluated through a temperature-sweep analysis and results revealed that the obtained profiles were consistent with that of the creep-recovery test.

        <p>Moreover, throughout the temperature-sweep profile it is also possible to detect a continuous decrease in G* up to 40 � C, which may be related to the melting of the butter that accounts for a significant part (25 g/100 g) of the dough, as equally observed by Kim et al. (2019). Afterwards, the modulus remains almost constant until 105-110 � C, when it starts to increase. Nevertheless, this phenomenon occurred at a lower temperature for cookies incorporated with encapsulated extract (~90 � C). When the temperature rose to above 120 � C, a further decrease of G' and G" was detected. It is inferred that the pyrolytic decomposition and leaching of the amylose in flour starch granule were induced, which may have caused the corresponding decrease (Kim et al., 2019).Moreover, throughout the temperature-sweep profile it is also possible to detect a continuous decrease in G* up to 40 � C, which may be related to the melting of the butter that accounts for a significant part (25 g/100 g) of the dough, as equally observed by Kim et al.

        <p>3D food printing is a digital manufacturing technology, which is used to fabricate three-dimensional structures in a layer-by-layer manner, using liquid-, gel-, or powder-type food materials as a printing medium; it includes three steps: modelling, 3D printing and post-processing. A range of 3D printing methods have been utilized for food printing, such as selective laser sintering/hot air sintering, hot-melt extrusion/room temperature extrusion, binder jetting, and inkjet printing (Holland, Tuck, &amp; Foster, 2018;Portanguen, Tournayre, Sicard, Astruc, &amp; Mirade, 2019;Sun, Zhou, Huang, Fuh, &amp; Hong, 2015). Among them, extrusion-based 3D food printing is the most widely adopted method, which consists of a material being extruded through a nozzle moving in x-, y-and z-direction, building up a structure layer-by-layer (Kim et al., 2019;Sun et al., 2018).3D food printing is a digital manufacturing technology, which is used to fabricate three-dimensional structures in a layer-by-layer manner, using liquid-, gel-, or powder-type food materials as a printing medium; it includes three steps: modelling, 3D printing and post-processing.

        <p>For a successful 3D printing step, it is required a material which can be smoothly extruded through the nozzle and, at the same time, can support the weight of the subsequent printed layers without deformation. In this context, the knowledge of the material's rheological and mechanical profiles is imperative to achieve proper extrudability and structure stability during the process (Liu, Zhang, Bhandari, &amp; Yang, 2018b;Wang, Zhang, Bhandari, &amp; Yang, 2018;Yang et al., 2018). Furthermore, 3D food printing is not only affected by the physicochemical properties of the ingredients used, but also by the process parameters, such as nozzle moving speed, extrusion rate, nozzle diameter, and layer and nozzle heights. This correlation between the food formula attributes and the operational conditions influences the printing precision and, thus, is a key factor in the end-product quality (Dankar et al., 2018;He, Zhang, &amp; Fang, 2019;P� erez, Nykvist, Brøgger, Larsen, &amp; Falkeborg, 2019).For a successful 3D printing step, it is required a material which can be smoothly extruded through the nozzle and, at the same time, can support the weight of the subsequent printed layers without deformation.

        <p>Lastly, the printed food pieces may require a further post-deposition cooking process (e.g. baking and boiling), which involves different levels of heat penetration in the food matrix; resulting in texture modifications and, possibly, misshapen structures (Dankar et al., 2018;Sun et al., 2018). Cookie dough is a material that unavoidably requires post-processing; however, it rapidly deforms after baking. Kim et al. (2019) have studied the addition of hydrocolloids as a structuring agent, aiming to suppress product deformation in the high-temperature environment of the post-processing step, whereas maintaining the ingredients and product characteristics of the desired cookie. Xanthan gum in the concentration of 0.5% was reported to promote the best shape accuracy of the selected 3D printed model after the baking process; therefore, it was chosen to develop the functional cookies of this work.Lastly, the printed food pieces may require a further post-deposition cooking process (e.g. baking and boiling), which involves different levels of heat penetration in the food matrix; resulting in texture modifications and, possibly, misshapen structures (Dankar et al., 2018;Sun et al., 2018).

Additionally, this 3D printing flexibility enables the use of alternative ingredients in food processing, such as microalgae, insects and fungi; in the production of tasty, healthy and tailored foods (An, Guo, Zhang, &amp; Zhong, 2019;Godoi, Prakash, &amp; Bhandari, 2016;Lille, Nurmela, Nordlund, Mets€ a-Kortelainen, &amp; Sozer, 2018;Severini, Azzollini, Albenzio, &amp; Derossi, 2018;Voon, An, Wong, Zhang, &amp; Chua, 2019).3D food printing is a tool which allows the creation of unique, innovative, products that other methods cannot emulate.

        <p>All 3D printed cookies presented shape fidelity in the range of 100 � 5.0%, demonstrating dimensional consistency with the 3D model (Fig. 5a). The effect of the cooking process over the cookies is showed in Fig. 5b. Upon baking, the cookie thickness varied from 3.37% for the biomass cookies, until 18.22% for the encapsulated extract cookies. The increase in this dimension is related to the gas production from the water vaporization and a higher dough elasticity, which explains the fact that the cookies incorporated with fresh alginate microbeads have an enlargement superior to the other formulations, corroborating the results obtained in the rheology analyses (Chevallier, Della Valle, Colonna, Broyart, &amp; Trystram, 2002).All 3D printed cookies presented shape fidelity in the range of 100 � 5.0%, demonstrating dimensional consistency with the 3D model (Fig. 5a).

        <p>Oppositely, the diameter of the cookies had a smaller variation after the post-processing treatment, as it can also be observed in Fig. 5b. Except for the encapsulated extract cookies, which suffered a shrinkage of around 7% probably due to the high water loss, all the other formulations suffered a positive influence of the temperature during baking. The heat promotes the melting of fat, which confers plasticity and an ease flow, resulting in an initial spreading followed by a width retraction at the end of the process (Walker, Seetharaman, &amp; Goldstein, 2012).Oppositely, the diameter of the cookies had a smaller variation after the post-processing treatment, as it can also be observed in Fig. 5b.

        <p>A number of parameters can be scrutinized from baked cookies that are of crucial importance to determine their adequacy. Colour is an attribute which impacts food quality, contributing to consumer's attraction to a product. The incorporation of A. platensis in different forms into cookie doughs stimulated a decrease in luminosity when compared to the control, which was more prominent in the biomass and free extract cookies (Fig. 6). Biomass cookies were distinguished by the microalga green tonality, showing negative values of a*; while the free extract cookies tended to the blue colour, represented by the C-phycocyanin distinctive pigmentation (Lucas, Morais, Santos, &amp; Costa, 2018).A number of parameters can be scrutinized from baked cookies that are of crucial importance to determine their adequacy.

        <p>Table 4 presents the total colour differences (ΔE*) between the raw dough and baked cookies, as well as the differences for each formulation over 30 days of storage time. A. platensis cookies showed significantly colour variation upon baking, with ΔE* varying from 17.47 to 25.50. This outcome may be explained primarily by the browning of cookie surface (lightness decrease and colour parameter increase), possibly due to formation of Maillard reaction products (MRP) through the interaction of reducing sugars with proteins, but also possibly owing to starch dextrinization and sugar caramelization. Moreover, changes in tonality may be related to pigment loss upon exposure to high temperatures (Batista et al., 2017;Chevallier et al., 2002).Table 4 presents the total colour differences (ΔE*) between the raw dough and baked cookies, as well as the differences for each formulation over 30 days of storage time.

        <p>On the other hand, along the conservation time, all cookie formulations presented a low ΔE*, principally the encapsulated extract cookie. According to Mokrzycki and Tatol (2011), ΔE* values between 1 and 2 indicate that only experienced observers can notice a colour difference, and values between 2 and 3.5 suggest that an inexperienced observer is also able to see the difference. Hence, it is possible to conclude that the encapsulation of A. platensis extract improved the cookie colour stability during the 30 days of storage time, when compared to other formulations.On the other hand, along the conservation time, all cookie formulations presented a low ΔE*, principally the encapsulated extract cookie.

        <p>Another essential physical stability factor, which gives an identity to a food product, is the texture (Carter, Galloway, Campbell, &amp; Carter, 2015). In this work, the cookie's texture was evaluated through a penetration test, and the results are represented in Fig. 7. As it has been stated for the cookie dough texture analysis (see section 3.2), the addition of A. platensis biomass promoted an increase in the cookie hardness. Inversely, the incorporation of microalgae antioxidant extract in fresh alginate microbeads resulted in a softer texture, which it was expected considering the water molecules present among the microparticles. Finally, over the 30 days of storage time, there was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the cookie texture for all the developed formulations.Another essential physical stability factor, which gives an identity to a food product, is the texture (Carter, Galloway, Campbell, &amp; Carter, 2015).

        <p>The incorporation of A. platensis into cookies by conventional methods has been described in the literature by a few authors, promoting different effects on the final product texture. Onacik-Gür, Zbikowska, and Majewska (2018) evaluated the addition of 1%, 2% and 3% of microalga powder and reported a decrease in the cookies hardness with the increase of microalga concentration. On the other hand, Marcinkowska-Lesiak, Onopiuk, Zalewska, Ciepłoch, and Barotti (2017) incorporated different powder amounts of the same species into shortbread biscuits, which promoted an increase in the cookie hardness directly proportional to the addition of microalga powder; therefore, corroborating with the results found for the 3D printed cookies of this study.The incorporation of A. platensis into cookies by conventional methods has been described in the literature by a few authors, promoting different effects on the final product texture.

        <p>Concomitantly with the food texture, water activity (a w ) is also a significant parameter regarding the conservation of low moisture cookies, particularly for the maintenance of a crispy texture. Furthermore, the food physical-chemical and microbiological stability depend greatly on the water content and its interaction with food ingredients. Water activity is a measure of the availability of water molecules to enter into microbial, enzymatic or chemical reactions. Therefore, this parameter has been used to assess the potential microbial growth and chemical stability of foods after manufacture. It is established that bacteria do not grow at a w values of 0.80 or below, while the limit for mould and yeast growth is 0.6 (Hough. Buera, Chirife, &amp; Moro, 2001;Khouryieh &amp; Aramouni, 2012). As Fig. 7 shows, all cookie formulations presented a w values below 0.3 throughout the 30 days of storage, indicating high microbiological stability.Concomitantly with the food texture, water activity (a w ) is also a significant parameter regarding the conservation of low moisture cookies, particularly for the maintenance of a crispy texture.

        <p>The microalga A. platensis is recognized to have notable free radical scavenging properties and antioxidant activity, due to the presence of natural pigments and other bioactive compounds in its composition. Its light-harvesting protein-pigment complexes called phycobilisomes are composed by phycobiliproteins, where C-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin are considered the most important ones. Moreover, this microalga contains phenolic compounds and a spectrum of natural mixed carotene and xanthophyll phytopigments that, together with phycocyanin, seem to be related to its distinguished antioxidant activity (Batista et al., 2017;Zaid, Hammad, &amp; Sharaf, 2015).The microalga A. platensis is recognized to have notable free radical scavenging properties and antioxidant activity, due to the presence of natural pigments and other bioactive compounds in its composition.

        <p>The 3D printed cookies developed in this work had their antioxidant capacity evaluated through the ORAC and ABTS assays after the postprocessing step and after 30 days of storage (Fig. 8). After the storage period, the encapsulated extract cookie exhibited a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) ORAC value compared to all other formulations, showing its improvement against processing and environmental factors. On the other hand, no significant difference between the formulations was found for ABTS assay. One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be due to the differences in the mechanism of action of those antioxidant analyses. The ORAC assay measures the affinity of antioxidative compounds to neutralize the free radicals over a period of time, accounting for any potential lag phases in antioxidant activity rather than providing a measurement of only fast acting antioxidants; whereas the ABTS assay neutralize free radicals at a particular point of time without accounting for slow-acting antioxidants (Nayak, Liu, &amp; Tang, 2015).The 3D printed cookies developed in this work had their antioxidant capacity evaluated through the ORAC and ABTS assays after the postprocessing step and after 30 days of storage (Fig. 8).

        <p>Additionally, it is noticeable that antioxidant capacity was also found for the cookies with no incorporation of A. platensis (control). Cookies are usually prepared with reducing sugars and a protein source, which leads to the formation of MRPs. Those compounds are one of the main responsible for the browning process characteristic of many foods, and it Fig. 6.

        <p>Total colour variation (ΔE*) between cooked and raw cookie samples and colour stability along conservation time. has been associated to an increase of their antioxidant potential (Nooshkam, Varidi, &amp; Bashash, 2019;Yilmaz &amp; Toledo, 2005). According to Manzocco, Calligaris, Mastrocola, Nicoli and Lerici (2000), it can be stated that in the development of the Maillard reaction, there is a positive correlation between colour and antioxidant properties. This correlation was found in foods where Maillard reaction was the sole or the prevalent event related to the antioxidant activity. Such circumstance generally occurs in food products with no or low content of naturally occurring antioxidants; which means that eventual changes in the antioxidant capacity upon processing are only due to the formation of heat-induced antioxidants. Given that, the antioxidant capacity found for the control cookies could be explained by the formation of MRPs, as antioxidant compounds are absent in its composition.Total colour variation (ΔE*) between cooked and raw cookie samples and colour stability along conservation time. has been associated to an increase of their antioxidant potential (Nooshkam, Varidi, &amp; Bashash, 2019;Yilmaz &amp; Toledo, 2005).

        <p>The microalga A. platensis was used as a source of antioxidants in the development of 3D printed cookies, based on functional food-inks. The antioxidant extraction was optimised through a DoE approach. Optimal conditions were 1 h extraction, with 0% ethanol and 2.0% biomass. All cookie dough formulations were suitable for extrusion, forming a homogenous filament with a diameter close to the nozzle aperture, and presenting dimensional consistency with the 3D model after the postdeposition step. Furthermore, the fortification with A. platensis resulted in 3D printed cookies with an innovative appearance. The encapsulation of the antioxidant extract was capable of improving the antioxidant activity and colour stability along the storage time when compared to all other formulations. Therefore, cookies developed in a 3D printer could be considered a promising alternative for the incorporation of new ingredients, such as microalgae, to obtain a novel functional food with antioxidant properties.The microalga A. platensis was used as a source of antioxidants in the development of 3D printed cookies, based on functional food-inks.
