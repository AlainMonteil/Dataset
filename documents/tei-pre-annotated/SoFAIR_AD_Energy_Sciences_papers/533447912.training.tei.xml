        <p>The transient photocurrent response of semiconductor electrodes to chopped illumination often shows spikes and overshoots that are usually interpreted as evidence that surface recombination is occurring. In the case of the high intensities used for light-driven water splitting, the interpretation is less straightforward since the electron transfer reactions are so slow that the minority carrier concentration at or near the surface increases to high values that modify the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer in the electrolyte, leading to 'band edge unpinning'. In addition, changes in chemical composition of the surface or local changes in pH may also alter the potential distribution across the semiconductor/electrolyte junction. A quantitative theory of band edge unpinning due to minority carrier build up is presented, and numerical calculations of transient photocurrent responses are compared with experimental examples for n-type Fe2O3 and p-type lithium-doped CuO electrodes. It is shown that the apparently high reaction orders (up to third order) with respect to hole concentration reported for hematite photoanodes can be explained as arising from an acceleration of hole transfer by the increased voltage drop across the Helmholtz layer associated with band edge unpinning. The limitations of the band edge unpinning model are discussed considering additional effects associated with modification of the potential distribution brought about by light-induced changes in surface composition, surface dipoles and surface ionic charge.</p>
        <p>Interest in semiconductor photoelectrochemistry has been rekindled in recent years by the prospect of being able to generate solar fuels by photoelectrolysis of water or photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, and many semiconductor materials have been investigated as potential photoanodes or photocathodes. Key issues are chemical stability, appropriate alignment of the semiconductor bands with the hydrogen and oxygen redox Fermi levels, efficient light harvesting and low recombination losses. Recombination losses are particularly problematic in the photoelectrolysis of water since the half reactions involve multiple electron/proton transfer steps, some with high activation energies. Since the overall rate constants for the oxidation or reduction of water by photogenerated minority carriers are remarkable low, minority carriers build up at or near the surface where they have a high probability of being lost by recombination with majority carriers. This process can be mediated by surface states (surface electron-hole recombination [1][2][3]) or occur in the space charge region near the surface ('near-surface recombination [4]). Over the last 30 years, the competition between charge transfer and surface recombination has been studied extensively by intensitymodulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS [5]), but it has proved difficult to derive definitive mechanistic information from the results. For this reason, alternative methods are needed to gain better insight into light-driven water splitting reactions.</p>
        <p>The build-up and decay of the minority carrier concentration near (or at) the photoelectrode surface under illumination can be detected by methods such as microwave reflectivity [6,7], optical absorption [8][9][10] and photocapacitance. [7,11,12] More commonly however, the effective lifetime of carriers at the surface is deduced from the photocurrent response to chopped illumination. Typically, in the photocurrent onset region, photocurrent transients for photoanode materials such as hematite (ÔÅ°-Fe2O3) exhibit the decay and negative overshoot shown in Figure 1 rather than a simple rectangular "on-off" response. [13,14] However, note that the 'decay' is significantly larger than the 'overshoot'. Incident photon flux (455 nm) 1.1 ÔÇ¥10 17 cm -2 s -1 . Film prepared by AACVD on FTO using ferrocene as precursor. [15] Two further examples of transient photocurrent responses are shown in Figures 2 and3 (see Appendix B for details of the preparation and characterization of these photoelectrodes).</p>
        <p>Figure 2 shows the transient photocurrent response for an ultrathin (14 nm) ALD layer of hematite on FTO that has been annealed at 600 o C. [16] The decay and overshoot are again evident, but in this case the risetime of the 'on' spike is considerably longer than that of the 'off' spike. Closer examination shows that the time constant for the rising part of the 'on' transient is 15 ms, which is much higher than the RC time constant of the system, which is more than an order of magnitude smaller. The RC time constant corresponds to the charging of the space charge capacitance through the series resistance of the electrode and electrolyte. It can become a problem is the series resistance is high (e.g. if using conducting glass substrates) or if the electrode capacitance is high (rough surfaces or high doping). The negative 'off' transient, on the other hand, is much sharper with a rise time of around 400 ÔÅ≠s. By contrast, the rise and fall times for the AACVD hematite film (Figure 1) are both around 3 ms, in good agreement with the RC time constant measured by IMPS. [14] The final experimental example shown in Figure 3 is for p-type LixCu1-xO (x = 0.013) [17],</p>
        <p>an oxide has stimulated interest as a potential photocathode material. [18] In this case, the cathodic photocurrent decays after the initial spike, but there is only a small overshoot. The We have previously explained the transient photocurrent response of semiconductor photoelectrodes as follows. [5,19] The 'instantaneous' photocurrent observed when the light is switched on corresponds to rapid separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs that takes place in the space charge region, with -for an n-type photoanode -holes moving to the interface to charge the space charge capacitance and electrons passing to the external circuit. In practice, the rise time of the 'on' spike is finite because it is determined by the RC time constant of the system, which is typically less than 1 ms for the kind of samples studied here. The subsequent photocurrent decay is then attributed to the build-up of photogenerated minority carriers (holes in this example) at or near the interface which causes an increasing flow of electrons (i.e. a negative current) into the surface due to recombination. After some time, a steady state is reached in which the rate at which holes reach the interface is exactly balanced by the rate at which they are consumed by charge transfer and recombination, and therefore the photocurrent becomes constant and equal to the current passing across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The negative overshoot seen when the light is switched off arises because the hole flux is interrupted abruptly, revealing just the electron flux, which decays until all excess holes have been consumed by recombination and charge transfer, and the current returns to zero.</p>
        <p>It follows from this explanation that the decrease in photocurrent up to the point at which the light is switched off (shown as 'decay' in Figure 1) should be equal in magnitude as the instantaneous negative spike ('overshoot' in Figure 1) since both measure the recombination current. However, in this example of the photocurrent response of a hematite electrode under intense illumination (roughly equivalent to 1 sun), this is evidently not the case. The negative spike is clearly smaller in magnitude than the decrease in current in the on period, so that some additional factor(s) besides recombination must be involved in the decay of the photocurrent after the initial spike. The most obvious explanation is that the build-up of holes at the interface modifies the potential distribution across the semiconductor electrolyte junction, increasing ÔÅÑVH, the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer and decreasing Œîùúô ùëÜùê∂ùëÖ , the potential drop across the space charge region.</p>
        <p>Since the applied potential relative to the flatband potential is equal to the sum of the potential drops across the space charge region and the Helmholtz region, any increase in ÔÅÑVH due to the build-up of charge must be matched by a corresponding decrease in band bending and hence of the photocurrent. We refer to this phenomenon as light-induced band edge unpinning, [20] since the change in ÔÅÑV H alters the alignment of the bands with respect to a reference redox level in the electrolyte.</p>
        <p>The consequences of light-induced band edge unpinning have been explored quantitatively for methods involving small amplitude sinusoidal perturbation of the electrode potential (photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy [21]: PEIS) or illumination (intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy: IMPS [22]). However, the implications of band edge unpinning for attempts to determine the kinetics of charge transfer and recombination using large amplitude "on-off" light steps have not been treated in any detail. Here we develop a relatively simple quantitative model that allows us to calculate the transient photocurrent response to periodic on-off illumination. The results show that the symmetry between the on and off transient spikes is lost when band edge unpinning occurs. In extreme cases at high band bending, the photocurrent may decay when the light is switched on but not show any overshoot when the light is switched off. We also consider other processes that may cause light-induced band edge unpinning in the context of water photoelectrolysis.</p>
        <p>We start by revisiting the simple model that we have used previously to describe the transient and periodic response of bulk (i.e. not nanostructured) photoelectrodes to small amplitude square wave or sinusoidal perturbations of light intensity or applied potential. We assume that absorption of photons creates electron-hole pairs that are separated by drift/diffusion. The solution of the generation collection value problem by G√§rtner [23] gives the flux of minority carriers into the interface region as (derivation for a n-type photoanode: see Appendix A for Glossary of symbols).</p>
        <p>where Wscr, the width of the space charge region (SCR), is given by</p>
        <p>2)</p>
        <p>It is important to stress that equation 1 applies to a reasonably planar electrode. In the case of nanostructured electrodes, the separation of electron hole pairs involves the movement of minority carriers over short distances to the large internal surface area of the layer (for a recent discussion see ref. [24]). Here we limit the initial discussion to the case of reasonably planar photoelectrodes but note that the same general approach is possible for microstructured electrodes, although the hole flux termequation 1-needs to be modified.</p>
        <p>The time-dependent surface concentration of holes (p surf , expressed as number per unit area) is determined by the rate of their arrival (i.e. the flux JG predicted by the G√§rtner equation) and the rate of their removal at the interface by charge transfer (first-order rate constant kt) and recombination (first-order rate constant kt).</p>
        <p>When the illumination is interrupted, equation 3 still applies with JG = 0.</p>
        <p>We note here that the formulation of equation 3 assumes that the rate of the photoelectrochemical process is first order in hole concentration. In the case of hematite and bismuth vanadate it has been reported that the rate of oxidation of water becomes third order in surface hole concentration at high intensities. [25,26] However, as we show below, the apparent reaction order of 3 reported by Le Formal et al. [25] for light-driven water oxidation on hematite is probably an artefact arising from band edge unpinning.</p>
        <p>If JG, kt and kr are independent of psurf and the charge transfer rate is first order in surface hole concentration, equation 3 is a simple first order linear differential equation with constant coefficients that is readily solved analytically to give the time dependence of the surface hole concentration. For a square illumination pulse of duration ÔÅ¥, the on and off parts of the transient hole concentration in the absence of band edge unpinning are</p>
        <p>where the steady state surface hole concentration is given by</p>
        <p>The symmetrical build up and decay of the surface hole density is illustrated in Figure 4.</p>
        <p>Note that the time axis is normalised as the dimensionless product (kt + kr)t, and the hole concentration axis has been normalized by dividing by the steady state hole concentration. The time constant for the symmetrical build-up and decay is given by (kt + kr) -1 . Since there is some confusion in the literature about what current is measured in the external circuit under transient conditions, we now examine the current densities associated with four processes: 1) the flow of holes into the interface, 2) charging of the space charge capacitance,</p>
        <p>3) charge transfer across the interface and 4) the flow of electrons into the surface due to surface recombination.</p>
        <p>Equation 3 can be rewritten in terms of current densities (rather than carrier fluxes) as</p>
        <p>We can now identify the individual terms in equation 6a. The change in surface hole concentration with time corresponds to charging of the space charge capacitance (or when psurf decreases with time during the off period of the transient, to discharging). Equation 6a is therefore equivalent to</p>
        <p>Note that here the hole current and transfer current both have a positive sign, whereas the recombination current has a negative sign since it corresponds to a flow of negatively charged electrons into the interface, i.e.</p>
        <p>The net current density measured at any time is equal to the sum of the (positive) hole current density and the (negative) recombination current density, i.e.</p>

        <p>This shows that the current measured in the external circuit at any instant during a photocurrent transient is not equal to the current transferred across the interface. There is also a charging component associated with the time dependence of the hole concentration at the surface. The measured current only becomes equal to the transfer current when the photocurrent decays to its steady state value ùëó ùëù‚Ñéùëúùë°ùëú (‚àû) and the charging current vanishes (</p>

        <p>The off transient (negative overshoot) is given by In this example ÔÅ®trans = 0.3, i. kt/(kt + kr) = 0.3, so that the steady-state photocurrent is 30% of the initial value.</p>
        <p>Note the identical magnitudes of the decay and overshoot of the photocurrent. Compare this behaviour with Figure 1, where the negative overshoot is considerably smaller than the decay. The upper two plots show the positive hole current and the negative recombination current. The sum of these two currents determines j photo . The plots have been offset on the vertical scale for clarity. These simple analytical solutions are valid provided that the build-up of minority carriers is sufficiently small that we can neglect changes in the potential distribution across the interface brought about by the charging and discharging of the space charge capacitance. For this reason, IMPS measurements are normally carried out using a steady dc illumination level and a much smaller (a few%) superimposed sinusoidal modulation. Strictly speaking, even in this case it is necessary to consider the light-induced ac modulation of the band bending, [22] although this is often neglected. The situation with large amplitude on-off illumination is different. If charge transfer is slow, the perturbation will change the surface concentration of minority carriers from a very low value in the dark to a much larger value under illumination. The minority carriers may be free (e.g. as holes in the valence band) or they may become trapped at surface states or as oxidized surface atoms (e.g. as Fe IV states on hematite [10] see below). The build-up of (in our case positive) charge in the photoelectrode will change the potential drops across the Helmholtz and space charge layers. The initial (dark) potential distribution is determined by the series connection of the space charge and Helmholtz capacitances.</p>
        <p>)</p>
        <p>where the space charge capacitance is given by the Mott Schottky equation.</p>
        <p>Under illumination, the potential distribution changes due to the build-up of holes at the interface by an amount</p>
        <p>We note in passing that one of the advantages of using a rough or nanostructured electrode is that the Helmholtz capacitance is increased and the surface hole concentration per unit area is decreased, both of which will reduce the extent of band edge unpinning under illumination (here we have assumed a reasonably flat surface).</p>
        <p>Since the reduction in the band bending implied by equation 8 affects JG, kt and kr, these three variables become functions of psurf, and equation 3 takes the non-linear form</p>
        <p>To simplify the analysis, we have assumed that the rate of water oxidation is first order in hole concentration [25]. In the subsequent equations we omit the psurf subscript for simplicity.</p>
        <p>We now consider the way in which JG, and kr depend on ùõøŒîùúô ùë†ùëêùëü as well as the dependence of kt on ùõøŒîùëâ ùêª . Equation 1shows that the flux of holes JG depends on the width of the space charge region, which in turn depends on Œîùúô ùë†ùëêùëü via equation 2. At the same time, we expect the pseudo-first order recombination rate constant kr to depend on the concentration of electrons (majority carriers) at the surface (these electrons can be either in the conduction band or in surface states). If recombination occurs via surface states, recombination can be formulated using the Shockley Read Hall (SRH) approach. [27,28] As we have pointed out previously, [1] this leads to a non-linear expression for the time dependence of the recombination rate that would need to be solved numerically for large amplitude perturbations. Here we take a simpler approach by assuming the rate of surface recombination depends on the concentration of electrons at the surface in a way that can be expressed empirically as</p>
        <p>Here ùëò ùëü,0 corresponds to the first order recombination rate constant for zero band bending. One of the puzzling features of surface recombination at hematite electrodes is that it is so slow.</p>
        <p>The value measured of kr measured by IMPS for a dc photon flux equivalent to one sun is only 10 2 s -1 at an estimated band bending of 0.4 -0.5 eV, and the rather weak potential dependence of kr corresponds to a value of ÔÅ¢ = 0.12 [14] (the weak potential dependence of kr may be the consequence of non-ideal behaviour arising from the storage of charge in surface states). Based on equation 10, ùëò ùëü,0 for hematite would be ca. 10 3 s -1 . This very low value strongly suggests that 'recombination' may in fact be an activated process involving chemical change at the surface rather than the annihilation of holes by electrons. This point is discussed further in section 4.</p>
        <p>This leaves the dependence of kt on Œîùëâ ùêª , which is rarely considered. One of the few papers to discuss this issue is by Waegele et al. [29] who used intense laser pulses to induce band edge unpinning in n-SrTiO3 photoanodes. These authors reported a Tafel-like dependence of the rate constant on Œîùëâ ùêª for the first (very fast) hole transfer in water oxidation. Our own work has shown that kt measured for untreated hematite electrodes increases in a quite complex way with bias potential. [14] To simplify the modelling, we adopt the normal approach used for metal electrodes and formulate the dependence of k t on Œîùëâ ùêª using the Tafel expression.</p>

        <p>We now have expressions that specify all three the non-linear terms in equation 8, so numerical solutions of the photocurrent transient problem become possible. A link to the numerical solution in 
            <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> is given in Appendix C.
        </p>
        <p>We begin by choosing materials parameter values that are reasonable for hematite photoanodes illuminated at 455 nm, namely Œµr = 25, Nd = 10 19 cm -3 , Œ± = 10 5 cm -1 , Lp = 1 nm. In addition, we take ÔÅ¢ = ÔÅß = 0.20, kt,0 = 1 s -1 , ùëò ùëü,0 = 10 2 s -1 and CH = 100 ÔÅ≠F cm -2 to allow for some surface roughness. Calculations of the transient response were performed for an incident photon flux The consequences of bend edge unpinning for the symmetry of the on and off transients is now evident in the photocurrent response. The much faster decay in the right-hand transient is primarily caused by band edge unpinning, which in this case reduces the potential drop across the space charge region from 0.68 V to 0.46 V, as shown below.</p>
        <p>The substantial band edge unpinning that arising from the build-up of holes at the interface is evident from the time-dependent behaviour of ÔÅÑÔÅ¶scr shown in Figure 8. 7). Contrast the asymmetric on/off plot of the surface hole concentration with the symmetrical plot in the absence of band edge unpinning shown in Figure 4. This strong asymmetry in the hole concentration plots has been seen in optical absorbance measurements on for hematite photoanodes [25] and in microwave reflectance measurements on p-type silicon photocathodes [7].</p>
        <p>The most obvious difference between Figures 5 and8 is that the symmetry in the build-up and decay of the hole concentration is lost when band edge unpinning occurs. The build-up of hole concentration is much faster than the subsequent decay in the dark. This result is significant because this behaviour has been reported in the literature. An excellent example is the work of Le Formal et al. [25] who used photoinduced absorbance (PIA) to follow the surface hole concentration during water oxidation on hematite electrodes on a long timescale (the 'on' time in these experiments was 5 seconds). At lower light intensities (ca. 10 14 cm -2 s -1 at 365 nm), the rise and decay of the PIA signal are symmetrical but increasing the light intensity in steps up to a maximum of ca. 10 17 cm -2 s -1 leads to a much more rapid rise of the absorbance, while the decay remains largely unaffected. The PIA transients for high intensities shown in Figure 2 Inspection of equations 10 and 11 shows that band edge unpinning that results from the build-up of holes at the surface increases both kr and kt. Figure 9 illustrates this effect for the photocurrent transient in Figure 7. The reduction in the width of the space charge region caused by band edge unpinning under illumination decreases the flux of holes to the surface as shown in Figure 10. This leads to a further reduction of the steady state photocurrent. As mentioned above, band edge unpinning can be detected using transient capacitance measurements. [7,30] Figure 11 shows the calculated transient change in the space charge capacitance associated with the photocurrent transient. Finally, when the applied voltage is increased sufficiently, recombination becomes unimportant so that band edge unpinning is entirely responsible for the decay of the photocurrent and the overshoot disappears, as shown in Figure 12 for an applied voltage (E -Efb (dark) = 1.2 V (other variables are the same as for Figure 7). In this case, the decay of the photocurrent is entirely due to the reduction in the width of the space charge regionand hence of JG -arising from band edge unpinning (see Figure 10). Other parameter values as for Figure 7.</p>
        <p>An interesting consequence of the dependence of kt on ÔÅÑVH is that at higher potentials, where recombination is negligible, the surface hole concentration does not increase linearly with intensity, whereas the photocurrent does. The reason is simple: the build-up of holes increases ÔÅÑVH, thereby increasing the rate constant for hole transfer. For the set of variable values used here, the calculation predicts that kt will increase by around a factor 50 when the intensity is increased from 10 13 cm -2 s -1 to 10 17 cm -2 s -1 .</p>
        <p>Figure 13 shows the non-linear behaviour of the surface hole concentration predicted for E -Efb = 1.5 V for the same variable values used in the preceding calculations. The plot matches rather well the experimental result measured by Le Formal et al. [25] for a hematite electrode using photoinduced absorbance. The plot of steady-state photocurrent is only slightly sub-linear (the deviation at I0 = 10 17 cm -2 s -1 is only -15%), whereas the plot of psurf is highly non-linear because k t increases exponentially with the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer cf. equation 11). The non-linear dependence of psurf on photocurrent has been interpreted by Le Formal et al in terms of the reaction order with respect to hole concentration of the overall oxygen evolution reaction. Based on a log-log plot of photocurrent vs. hole concentration, these authors concluded that the reaction order varies from 1 at low intensities to 3 at high intensities. In order to see if this behaviour could be explained by band edge unpinning and the resulting increase in the first order rate constant kt, the data in Figure 13 have been replotted as a log-log plot as shown in Figure 14. The plot shows that the reaction order with respect to psurf does indeed appear to change from 1 to 3 as the intensity is increased. However, in our calculations, the reaction order is 1, and the change in slope is due to the 50-fold increase in kt resulting from the increased driving force for hole transfer associated with band edge unpinning (cf. equation 10 which represents the exponential Tafel dependence of kt on ÔÅÑVH). The increase in ÔÅÑVH and kt with light intensity is illustrated in Figure 15 for the same set of variables as those used to calculate Figure 13.</p>
        <p>The results of the modelling show that care is needed when interpreting on-off photocurrent transients produced by high intensity illumination because the build-up of charges at the surface can cause band edge unpinning, which alters the potential distribution across the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and hence the rate constants for recombination and charge transfer. The question now arises, can the modelling explain the results in Figures 1 to 3?</p>
        <p>Figure 1 showed the transient response of an annealed hematite layer prepared by AACVD using ferrocene as precursor. In this case, it appears that the asymmetric transient photocurrent response can be explained in terms of band edge unpinning. However, quantitative comparison is complicated by the fact that the hematite layer is nanostructured on the scale of a few hundred nanometres. Provided that the width of the space charge region is smaller than the crystallite size, the basic concepts of the model are still applicable, although the hole flux is now lower because it takes place into the internal surface area of the porous layer. At the same time, the Helmholtz capacitance is increased by the surface roughness factor, which for similar films is reported to be around 20. [25] The surface roughness will therefore reduce the effects of bandedge unpinning. In fact, the experimental transient was measured for an incident photon flux ten times higher (10 17 cm -2 s -1 ) than the value used in the calculations, so that the band edge unpinning in both cases should be similar taking the surface roughness into account.</p>
        <p>By contrast, several aspects of the transients in Figures 2 and3 are puzzling. Why is the rise time of the photocurrent in the case of the ultrathin ALD hematite layer so slow, whereas the negative current overshoot is much faster? Why do the transients for p-type lithium doped CuO in Figure 3 become smaller with successive light pulses? At this point it is appropriate to widen the discussion to consider other effects that can influence the shape of photocurrent transients.</p>
        <p>The theory that is outlined in section 2 is based in the assumption that the photoelectrode is both macroscopic and reasonably planar so that both the illumination and the charge separation by drift diffusion take place in a direction that is normal to the electrode surface. If the electrode is nanostructured, different approaches to the minority carrier generation/collection problem are necessary, as we have discussed elsewhere. [24] As pointed out in section 3, provided that the material is sufficiently highly doped that the space charge region is smaller than the characteristic feature size (e.g. nanowire radius), a similar approach involving the superimposition of displacement and recombination currents is still possible, and this appears to be the case for the hematite sample prepared by AACVD. However, in the case of mesoporous layers of lower doped materials in which the band bending is severely limited by the size of the particles, [31] carrier transport is likely to be controlled by trap-limited diffusion.</p>
        <p>For such cases, a different approach will be necessary. The situation with hydrogen evolution on p-type materials can be equally complex. For example, in the case of hydrogen evolution on p-GaAs, Ern√© et al. have used in situ infrared spectroscopy to show that the reaction involves changing the surface termination from As-OH via unterminated As . to As-H. [33] In this case, the anodic photocurrent overshoot arises from oxidation of surface-bound hydrogen by holes rather than from electron-hole recombination.</p>
        <p>By analogy, in the case of hematite photoanodes, the cathodic overshoot may well correspond to reduction of surface Fe=O species by electrons to form Fe-OH rather than electron-hole recombination in the conventional sense. This interpretation would certainly be consistent with spectroelectrochemical [10] and transient absorption [25] measurements.</p>
        <p>We also need to remember that the potential drop across the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface is determined not only by the electronic charge and by the surface dipoles associated with the termination of the semiconductor lattice by chemical groups bonded to the surface but also by oriented solvent molecules as well as by the ionic surface charge associated with the acid/base properties of the semiconductor itself or of surface oxides. The latter effect introduces a pH-dependent ionic surface charge and hence potential drop. In the modelling in the previous section, we have assumed that all these contributions to the potential drop remain unchanged under illumination. In the case of water splitting reactions, we know that the intermediates in the multistep electron/proton transfer reaction must be bound to the electrode surface.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the photoelectrolysis reactions will lead to changes in local pH: in the case of oxide photoanodes, for example, the decrease in pH due to oxygen evolution will shift the flatband potential to more positive values, decreasing the band bending for a fixed applied voltage. Similarly, the increase in pH associated with hydrogen evolution at p-type cathodes will shift the flatband potential to more negative values, again decreasing the band bending for a fixed applied voltage. The effects of pH changes will be most evident in the case of unbuffered electrolyte solutions and high photocurrents. In view of the complications identified in the preceding discussion, we conclude that our model represents a simplification and generalization that should be used with care.</p>
        <p>Returning to the experimental results, it will be clear by now that the model does not explain the slow rise of the photocurrent measured in the case of thin ALD layers of hematite. A finite rise time is expected, of course, as a result of the RC time constant of the series resistance and electrode capacitance, but this RC pulse shaping should affect both the on and off transient, which is clearly not the case here. It therefore appears that there is a delay in holes reaching the surface. Our model has assumed rapid displacement of free photogenerated charges in the space charge region, but if charge trapping occurs, carriers will reach the surface by a sequence of trapping and detrapping events. Slow photocurrent risetimes are characteristic of systems with multiple trapping: the best-known example is the dye-sensitized solar cell. [34] We therefore tentatively attribute the slow risetime of the anodic photocurrent to hole trapping [35] or polaron formation [36]in the ALD hematite layer. The fast negative 'off' transient suggests that the electron mobility in the ALD layers is much less affected by trapping or polaron formation.</p>
        <p>The photocathodic transients for lithium-doped CuO could in principle be due to band edge unpinning by the build-up of electrons at the interface, but one could also envisage formation of surface Cu(I) species resulting from electron capture by Cu(II) states. Recombination would then correspond to oxidation by holes of Cu(I) back to Cu(II). This raises the question whether the photocurrent is indeed due to hydrogen evolution rather than photocathodic reduction of CuO to Cu2O or to Cu. To investigate this, a hydrogen sensor was used to confirm that the Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen production is close to 100%. The fact that the photocurrent spikes become smaller on successive light pulses led us to suspect that the increase in pH associated with hydrogen evolution shifts the flatband potential to progressively more negative values, thereby decreasing the band bending in the photocathode and hence the photocurrent.</p>
        <p>The ca. 1 mA cm -2 photocurrent pulses will each generate around 50 nanomoles cm -2 of OH -.</p>
        <p>To obtain an idea of the local OH -concentration, we consider that the photoelectrochemical reaction in an unstirred solution will create a diffusion layer in solution with an order of magnitude thickness of (DOH-t) 1/2 ÔÇª 200 ÔÅ≠m. At the end of the light pulse, the surface concentration of OH -will be of the order of several mM, so that since the solution is unbuffered, the pH will have increased by 3 pH units during the light pulse, which corresponds to a negative shift of the flatband potential by around 180 mV, enough to cause the decay seen in the photocurrent.</p>
        <p>An important conclusion is that the interpretation of both steady state and transient kinetic More sophisticated 3-D optical and electrochemical modelling for nanostructured electrodes used for photoelectrochemical water splitting should be possible using the basic concepts outlined here. However, progress in understanding at the molecular level will also depend on the extent to which non-electrochemical techniques can help to unravel the kinetics and mechanism of the reactions taking place. We hope that the present paper offers a suitable starting point for further quantitative theoretical and experimental studies of the kinetics and mechanisms of light-driven water splitting.</p>

        <p>The preparation of the ALD hematite photoanodes has been previously reported. [37] Briefly, the FTO substrates were precleaned by successive sonication with detergent, DI water and isopropanol dried and placed in a Picosun R-200 Advanced ALD reactor at 250¬∞C. They were then subjected to 450 ALD cycles. Each cycle consisted of a 1.5 s dosing of ferrocene gas (Aldrich, 98%, sublimed from a stainless-steel container at 90¬∞C), 7 s exposure and 8 s nitrogen purge followed by a 6 s dosing of ozone, 7 s exposure and 8 s purge. The purge gas was 99.999 % nitrogen and the base pressure between dosings was approximately 6 hPa. The processed samples were placed in a muffle furnace, heated to 600¬∞C in air over 3 h and held at that temperature for 30 min. After cooling the active area was masked using PTFE adhesive tape and the FTO substrate was contacted using conductive silver paste. doped CuO is consistent with incorporation of a small amount of lithium ions, which have a slightly larger ionic radius (0.76 √Ö) than Cu 2+ ion (0.73 √Ö). ICP-AAS analysis showed that that Li ions content in the films was 1.3 at-%. During the photocurrent measurements a calibrated hydrogen needle sensor (Unisense, H2-NPLR) was used to monitor the change in hydrogen concentration over time.</p>
