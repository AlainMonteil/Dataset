        <p>Linear conjugated polymers have potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water but so far, most studies have involved non-scalable sacrificial reagents. Z-schemes comprising more than one semiconductor are a potential solution, but it is challenging to design these systems because multiple components must work together synergistically. Here, we show that a conjugated polymer photocatalyst for proton reduction can be coupled in a Z-scheme with an inorganic water oxidation photocatalyst to promote overall water splitting without any sacrificial reagents. First, a promising combination of an organic catalyst, an inorganic catalyst, and a redox mediator was identified by using high-throughput screening of a library of components. A Z-scheme system composed of P10 (homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone)-Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ -BiVO 4 was then constructed for overall water splitting under visible light irradiation. Transient absorption spectroscopy was used to assign timescales to the various steps in the photocatalytic process. While the overall solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of this first example is low, it provides proof of concept for other hybrid organic-inorganic Z-scheme architectures in the future.Linear conjugated polymers have potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water but so far, most studies have involved non-scalable sacrificial reagents.

        <p>The photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water using solar energy has been studied extensively because it promises the sustainable production of renewable fuels from abundant resources. [1][2][3] Photoelectrocatalysis 4-6 and direct photocatalysis using catalyst suspensions have both been studied in detail. 5 Conceptually, direct hydrogen production using photocatalyst suspensions is the simplest water-splitting approach in technological terms and it is potentially amenable to large-scale deployment. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] Recently, several examples of photocatalysis has been reported as a one-step overall water splitting. [18][19][20] However, recombination of electron-hole pairs tends to decrease the photocatalytic reaction efficiency. Moreover, relatively few materials are known that both efficiently absorb visible light and have suitable valence and conduction band energetics. As such, a number of research teams have investigated systems that mimic nature using a two-step excitation process for overall water splitting, typically by coupling together two different photocatalysts with a redox mediator to form a 'Z-scheme'. [21][22][23][24] Most photocatalysts so far have been inorganic materials, but organic photocatalysts have attracted growing attention 25 because they can be prepared from earth-abundant elements and their properties-and in particular their light absorption spectrum-can be tuned easily and continuously by copolymerisation. [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34] However, most polymer studies have been confined to the sacrificial half-reaction that produces hydrogen only, and few organic photocatalysts have been developed for overall water splitting. Carbon nitrides have been coupled with WO 3 , which acts as an O 2 evolution photocatalyst in a Z-scheme system for overall water splitting, 26,27,35 but the efficiencies were limited by the commonly observed back reaction. Other composites that are reported to facilitate overall water splitting are carbon nanodot-carbon nitride nanocomposites, 36 Pt/PtO x /CoO x -loaded carbon nitrides 37 , and Pt/CoP-loaded carbon nitrides. 38 All of these materials are based on carbon nitride, which limits the potential for structural diversity and control over fundamental physical properties, such as optical gap. Also, the use of high synthesis temperatures for carbon nitrides yields relatively poorly defined bulk materials whose precise structure and composition can be hard to elucidate: this in turn makes it hard to establish structure-property relationships.The photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water using solar energy has been studied extensively because it promises the sustainable production of renewable fuels from abundant resources.

        <p>First, we explored a range of polymer photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution half-reaction and various metal oxide materials as photocatalysts for oxygen production. To do this, we performed high-throughput screening whereby the photocatalysts (5 mg) were added to water (5 mL) containing a redox mediator and dispersed by ultrasonication. The samples were then illuminated with a solar simulator for 5 hours before measuring the amount of hydrogen or oxygen produced using an automated gas chromatograph equipped with a pulsed discharge detector. We explored various polymers for the hydrogen evolution halfreaction, that is; P10 (homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone), 28 P34 (poly[9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene-2,7-diyl]), 39 P64 (dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone dibenzo[b,d]thiophene copolymer), 31,34 P74 (2,1,3-benzothiadiazole dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone co-polymer), and S-CMP3 (conjugated microporous polymer based on dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone and 2,2',7,7'-linked 9,9'spirobifluorene) 39 (Fig. 1a and Fig. S-1). For the oxygen producing half-reaction, we considered various metal oxides that were reported previously, such as BiVO 4 and WO 3 (Fig. 1b). The polymers were prepared using Pd(0)catalysed cross-coupling reactions and characterised using UVvis spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), scanning electron microscope (SEM), static light scattering, and time-resolved single photon counting (TRSPC) (Fig. S-2 to S-16). All polymers contained residual metallic palladium particles, as evident from electron paramagnetic resonance results (Fig. S-17), which remained in the materials after work-up; this residual metal acts as a cocatalyst for hydrogen production, instead of the more commonly used platinum. 30,39,40 Both the polymers and the inorganic materials were tested against a range of electron donors and acceptors (i.e., Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ , 41 I -/IO 3 -, 42 Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ , 43 NO 2 - /NO 3 -, 44 [Co(phen) 3 ] 3+/2+ , and [Co(bpy) 3 ] 3+/2+ ) 22 to identify candidate redox pair combinations that could be taken forward in a Z-scheme for overall water-splitting. Under these screening conditions, we found that the highest hydrogen evolution activity was obtained for polymer P10 with FeCl 2 at pH 2.7 acting as the electron donor (hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 1.4 µmol h -1 for 5 mg photocatalyst under solar simulator illumination AM1.5G, irradiation area = 4 cm 2 ; pressure = 1 bar, N 2 ). This rate was significantly higher than for the other polymers (P74, P64, P34 and S-CMP3), as tested under the same conditions (Fig. 1a). The catalytic rate for P10 with FeCl 2 was more than 10 times lower than for triethylamine under the equivalent conditions (17.2 µmol h -1 ). The latter involves the irreversible oxidation of an organic donor, but the Fe 2+ -catalysed rate was sufficiently high to offer promise as a potential partner in a Z-scheme. An oxygen production screen showed that BiVO 4 coupled with FeCl 3 as the electron donor, again at pH 2.7, gave the highest oxygen evolution rates (Fig. 1b; OER, 0.32 µmol h -1 , 5 mg photocatalyst), suggesting P10 / BiVO 4 / Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ as a potential Z-scheme. The ionisation potential of P10, as previously predicted by DFT, 28 indicates that it is possible to oxidise Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ ; likewise, the experimental band positions for BiVO 4 46 allow for the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ (Fig. 2). The resulting holes in BiVO 4 have a large driving force for water oxidation and the electrons in P10 have a large driving force for proton reduction. Hence, the combination of high-throughput photocatalysis screening and the predicted and measured potentials of the charge carriers in P10 and BiVO 4 , respectively, prompted us to explore Z-schemes comprising P10 for hydrogen production and BiVO 4 for oxygen production with a Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ redox couple. We tested a Z-scheme for overall water splitting using different ratios of P10 and BiVO 4 and different amounts of residual Pd, as shown in Table 1. For P10 containing 160 ppm of Pd, a low H 2 evolution rate was observed (0.05 µmol h -1 , entry 1), along with a much higher, non-stoichiometric O 2 evolution rate (1 µmol h - 1 , Entry 1). In line with previous observations on threshold values for metal incorporation for optimum H 2 production in sacrificial systems, 30,47 we found significantly increased H 2 evolution rates (4 µmol h -1 , Entry 3) when P10 containing 3300 ppm residual Pd. The accompanying O 2 evolution rate was 0.93 µmol h -1 . Ruthenium, which is often used as a co-catalyst for hydrogen evolution catalysts in Z-schemes 22,48 , acted here as a poor cocatalyst; for a Z-scheme with 2500 ppm Ru-loaded P10, we observed low, non-stoichiometric gas production rates (H 2 : 0.16 µmol h -1 ; O 2 : 0.76 µmol h -1 , Entry 2). Decreasing the amount of the organic photocatalyst P10 (3300 ppm Pd) relative to BiVO 4 from 50:50 w/w to 7:50 w/w caused the water splitting reaction to proceed approximately stoichiometrically (H 2 : 3 µmol h -1 ; O 2 : 1.29 µmol h -1 , Entry 5). When the amount of polymer was reduced even further (4:50 w/w P10:BiVO 4 ), the water splitting reaction still proceeded in a stoichiometric ratio (H 2 : 3.55 µmol h -1 ; O 2 : 1.76 µmol h -1 , Entry 6). The need for more BiVO 4 than P10 for stoichiometric water splitting aligns with our observation that P10 evolves significantly more hydrogen under sacrificial conditions than BiVO 4 does oxygen; as such, reducing the amount of the more active polymer photocatalyst lowers its competitive light absorption and light scattering, hence increasing the overall activity of the Z-scheme (for example, compare entries 4 and 5). In experiments where the redox mediator was initially Fe 3+ , we observed only oxygen production at the start of the reaction, as shown in Fig. 3a. This is consistent with the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ by BiVO 4 . After 6 hours, we observed steady and simultaneous H 2 and O 2 production close to the expected stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 (H 2 : 3 µmol h -1 and O 2 : 1.29 µmol h -1 ) for 7 mg P10 in Z-scheme system under a visible light illumination (λ &gt; 420 nm, 300 W Xe light source; Fig. S-23). Under solar simulator irradiation, we observed rates of 0.66 µmol h -1 for H 2 , and 0.29 µmol h -1 for O 2 (Fig. 3d). When Fe 2+ was used as the initial species in the redox mediator solution, we observed both H 2 and O 2 production under a visible light illumination (λ &gt; 420 nm, 300 W Xe light source; Fig. 3b) Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins but the ratio was non-stoichiometric (5.4:1 H 2 :O 2 ) at the start of the reaction. After a total of 10 hours, we saw stoichiometric production of H 2 and O 2 (H 2 : 5.0 µmol h -1 ; O 2 : 2.7 µmol h -1 ). Thus, overall water splitting proceeded in both cases, starting with either FeCl 3 or FeCl 2 . As expected in either case the system has to equilibrate towards a mixture of Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ which enables both catalysts to drive hydrogen and oxygen production in stoichiometric amounts after an initial period of nonstoichiometric water splitting. In the absence of a redox mediator, no overall water splitting proceeds, showing that electron and hole transfer indeed occurs via the redox mediator (Fig. S-29). As might be expected, higher rates were observed under broadband illumination (full arc, 300 W Xe light source) and rates of 10.8 μmol h -1 and 4.5 μmol h -1 were determined for H 2 and O 2 production for a Z-scheme consisting of P10/BiVO 4 (4:50) with FeCl 3 (Fig. 3c). Further evidence that overall water splitting was taking place was that (i) a colorimetric experiment confirmed the conversion of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ ; (ii) the amount of O 2 evolved was larger than the amount of Fe 3+ in the FeCl 3 solution (60 μmol); (iii) the total amount of H 2 generated this experiment (125.2 μmol, Fig. S-24) was larger than the amount of hydrogen in the P10 sample (56 μmol), thus ruling out the possibility that the H 2 was produced from a self-corrosion process. Longer term stability was evaluated for 70 h under visible light irradiation (Fig. S-24) followed by 5 hours full arc irradiation showing stabile water splitting over extended time. Post illumination analysis also showed no significant changes in the UV-vis, photoluminescence, FT-IR spectra, and PXRD patterns for the catalysts (Fig. S-31 to S-34). We did observe that a small amount of H 2 was produced by P10 in water only (i.e., in the absence of any intentionally added redox mediator, Fig. S-35), possibly due to self-oxidation of the photocatalyst. However, when D 2 O was used as the proton source for P10 in the presence of FeCl 2 D 2 production was mostly observed (Fig. S-36), which rules out that this self-oxidation is the source of the H 2 in the Z-scheme experiments. Possibly the self-oxidation is also suppressed in the presence of electron mediator. We also note that the pH value remains virtually unchanged during the experiment, which shows that no Fe(OH) 3 was formed. 49 Decomposition of BiVO 4 was not expected to occur at pH 2.4, but this been observed under more acidic conditions. 48 The back reaction to form water from evolved H 2 and O 2 can be an issue for overall water splitting because noble metal cocatalysts can accelerate this. 23,26 For the Z-scheme presented here, we did not observe a reduction in the amounts of H 2 and O 2 gas in the dark when the light source was switched off (Fig. S-23), suggesting that no significant thermal back reaction was taking place. We next examined the behaviour of the photocatalytic system by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to confirm the proposed mechanism of water splitting (Fig. 2). Initially, we studied P10 containing 0.33 wt. % Pd in the absence of the redox mediator in water at pH 2.7 (Fig. 4a). Following excitation, a broad negative signal was observed at wavelengths below 740 nm, which has been assigned previously to stimulated emission by comparison to the photoluminescence spectrum of P10. 28 From 740 nm to greater than 860 nm, a photoinduced absorption (PIA) was observed. Very similar behaviour was observed in a TA study of P10 in pure water, with the PIA assigned to singlet exciton formation. The decay kinetics of the PIA and the stimulated emission are complex, requiring greater than 4 exponential components to achieve a satisfactory fit likely due to the distribution of polymer structures present (Fig. S-37). However, the time taken for the initially measured TA change to decay by 50% (t 50% ) for both the PIA and emission were similar (t 50% ~1.7 ps and 2.2 ps at 843 nm and 540 nm), respectively. Marked differences were observed in the TA spectra in the presence of 4 mM of Fe 2+ (Fig. 4b). The features due to stimulated emission (&lt;740 nm) and the initial singlet excitons (&gt;740 nm) were still present, but a new band also grows in within 10 ps, centered at 640 nm. Similar features were assigned previously to the formation of the electron polaron with P10 in the presence of an amine electron donor. 28 Here, we also assign this band to P10 -, confirming the role of the Fe 2+ species. In the presence of Fe 2+ , the rate of decay of the PIA at 843 nm (t 50% ~ 1.3 ps) and the bleach at 550 nm (t 50% ~ 2.1 ps) is similar to that measured in the absence of the electron donor (Fig. S-38). It is notable that the 640 nm band is very long-lived (&gt;3.3 ns; the longest timescale we can study here). By contrast, in water alone, minimal TA signals remain after this timescale and, if present at all, the 640 nm band is much weaker in intensity (Fig. 4a). When both Fe 2+ (4 mM) and Fe 3+ (4 mM) are in the P10 suspension, we see similar behaviour to when Fe 2+ alone is present, with the efficient formation of the electron polaron still occurring (Fig. 4c), persisting to timescales beyond the maximum that can be studied here (Fig. S-39) with no notable loss in lifetime. It is therefore apparent that despite the presence of Fe 3+ , which might be expected to act as an electron scavenger, long-lived P10 -species can still be formed, which is known to be a requirement since H 2 evolution is thought to occur on the micro-to millisecond timescale. 28 A significantly decreased intensity of the 640 nm PIA is observed using Fe 3+ (Figure 4d). The small absorption at 640 nm could be due to the presence of a not fully charge separated state, with spectral features similar to that of the electron polaron. Alternatively, it may indicate that a small population of the P10 electron polaron can be formed, may be due to the build-up of Fe 2+ following the excitation of the sample for prolonged periods. Attempts to study BiVO 4 by TA here were unsuccessful due to the colloidal instability of the suspensions. However, electron scavenging by Fe 3+/2+ following the photoexcitation of BiVO 4 has been studied previously by TA spectroscopy. There, 50 electron scavenging with Fe 3+ occurred within a few microseconds of BiVO 4 excitation, with the photogenerated holes on BiVO 4 being then retained for &gt; 100 µs, indicating that both back electron transfer to Fe 2+ and the transfer of the hole into water occur on a slower timescale. Therefore, in light of our new experiments and the literature results 28,50 discussed above, we are able to propose timescales for the individual steps in the Z-scheme system (Fig. 5).First, we explored a range of polymer photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution half-reaction and various metal oxide materials as photocatalysts for oxygen production. To do this, we performed high-throughput screening whereby the photocatalysts (5 mg) were added to water (5 mL) containing a redox mediator and dispersed by ultrasonication.

For the oxygen producing half-reaction, we considered various metal oxides that were reported previously, such as BiVO 4 and WO 3 (Fig. 1b).

Further evidence that overall water splitting was taking place was that (i) a colorimetric experiment confirmed the conversion of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ ; (ii) the amount of O 2 evolved was larger than the amount of Fe 3+ in the FeCl 3 solution (60 μmol); (iii) the total amount of H 2 generated this experiment (125.2 μmol, Fig. S-24) was larger than the amount of hydrogen in the P10 sample (56 μmol), thus ruling out the possibility that the H 2 was produced from a self-corrosion process. Longer term stability was evaluated for 70 h under visible light irradiation (Fig. S-24) followed by 5 hours full arc irradiation showing stabile water splitting over extended time. Post illumination analysis also showed no significant changes in the UV-vis, photoluminescence, FT-IR spectra, and PXRD patterns for the catalysts (Fig. S-31 to S-34). We did observe that a small amount of H 2 was produced by P10 in water only (i.e., in the absence of any intentionally added redox mediator, Fig. S-35), possibly due to self-oxidation of the photocatalyst. However, when D 2 O was used as the proton source for P10 in the presence of FeCl 2 D 2 production was mostly observed (Fig. S-36), which rules out that this self-oxidation is the source of the H 2 in the Z-scheme experiments. Possibly the self-oxidation is also suppressed in the presence of electron mediator. We also note that the pH value remains virtually unchanged during the experiment, which shows that no Fe(OH) 3 was formed. 49 Decomposition of BiVO 4 was not expected to occur at pH 2.4, but this been observed under more acidic conditions. 48 The back reaction to form water from evolved H 2 and O 2 can be an issue for overall water splitting because noble metal cocatalysts can accelerate this. 23,26 For the Z-scheme presented here, we did not observe a reduction in the amounts of H 2 and O 2 gas in the dark when the light source was switched off (Fig. S-23), suggesting that no significant thermal back reaction was taking place. We next examined the behaviour of the photocatalytic system by transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to confirm the proposed mechanism of water splitting (Fig. 2). Initially, we studied P10 containing 0.33 wt. % Pd in the absence of the redox mediator in water at pH 2.7 (Fig. 4a). Following excitation, a broad negative signal was observed at wavelengths below 740 nm, which has been assigned previously to stimulated emission by comparison to the photoluminescence spectrum of P10. 28 From 740 nm to greater than 860 nm, a photoinduced absorption (PIA) was observed. Very similar behaviour was observed in a TA study of P10 in pure water, with the PIA assigned to singlet exciton formation. The decay kinetics of the PIA and the stimulated emission are complex, requiring greater than 4 exponential components to achieve a satisfactory fit likely due to the distribution of polymer structures present (Fig. S-37). However, the time taken for the initially measured TA change to decay by 50% (t 50% ) for both the PIA and emission were similar (t 50% ~1.7 ps and 2.2 ps at 843 nm and 540 nm), respectively. Marked differences were observed in the TA spectra in the presence of 4 mM of Fe 2+ (Fig. 4b). The features due to stimulated emission (&lt;740 nm) and the initial singlet excitons (&gt;740 nm) were still present, but a new band also grows in within 10 ps, centered at 640 nm. Similar features were assigned previously to the formation of the electron polaron with P10 in the presence of an amine electron donor. 28 Here, we also assign this band to P10 -, confirming the role of the Fe 2+ species. In the presence of Fe 2+ , the rate of decay of the PIA at 843 nm (t 50% ~ 1.3 ps) and the bleach at 550 nm (t 50% ~ 2.1 ps) is similar to that measured in the absence of the electron donor (Fig. S-38). It is notable that the 640 nm band is very long-lived (&gt;3.3 ns; the longest timescale we can study here). By contrast, in water alone, minimal TA signals remain after this timescale and, if present at all, the 640 nm band is much weaker in intensity (Fig. 4a). When both Fe 2+ (4 mM) and Fe 3+ (4 mM) are in the P10 suspension, we see similar behaviour to when Fe 2+ alone is present, with the efficient formation of the electron polaron still occurring (Fig. 4c), persisting to timescales beyond the maximum that can be studied here (Fig. S-39) with no notable loss in lifetime. It is therefore apparent that despite the presence of Fe 3+ , which might be expected to act as an electron scavenger, long-lived P10 -species can still be formed, which is known to be a requirement since H 2 evolution is thought to occur on the micro-to millisecond timescale. 28 A significantly decreased intensity of the 640 nm PIA is observed using Fe 3+ (Figure 4d). The small absorption at 640 nm could be due to the presence of a not fully charge separated state, with spectral features similar to that of the electron polaron. Alternatively, it may indicate that a small population of the P10 electron polaron can be formed, may be due to the build-up of Fe 2+ following the excitation of the sample for prolonged periods. Attempts to study BiVO 4 by TA here were unsuccessful due to the colloidal instability of the suspensions. However, electron scavenging by Fe 3+/2+ following the photoexcitation of BiVO 4 has been studied previously by TA spectroscopy. There, 50 electron scavenging with Fe 3+ occurred within a few microseconds of BiVO 4 excitation, with the photogenerated holes on BiVO 4 being then retained for &gt; 100 µs, indicating that both back electron transfer to Fe 2+ and the transfer of the hole into water occur on a slower timescale. Therefore, in light of our new experiments and the literature results 28,50 discussed above, we are able to propose timescales for the individual steps in the Z-scheme system (Fig. 5).</p>
