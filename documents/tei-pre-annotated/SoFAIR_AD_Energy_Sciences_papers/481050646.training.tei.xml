        <p>Understanding who would be affected in which way by carbon pricing is pivotal for effective and socially equitable policy design, addressing climate change and reducing inequality. This paper focuses on eight key countries in developing Asia (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam). By combining national household surveys with inputoutput data, we compare the distributional effects of four carbon pricing design options, including a globally harmonized carbon price, a national carbon price and sectoral carbon prices in the power and transport sectors, respectively. Our analysis reveals a substantial degree of variation regarding who would be affected across policy designs and countries. Looking into national carbon pricing as the most favourable policy option from an economic point of view, we find that differences in distributional outcomes are generally more pronounced within income groups than across income groups. These differences are mainly driven by households' energy use patterns, which vary across countries. Equally recycling revenues back to all citizens would overcompensate the burden of a carbon price for the poorest households in all countries.Understanding who would be affected in which way by carbon pricing is pivotal for effective and socially equitable policy design, addressing climate change and reducing inequality.

        <p>T o achieve the Paris goals, climate policies will increasingly need to be implemented in low-and middle-income countries. A growing number of countries consider carbon pricing as a means to achieve their emissions targets, including in Asia 1 . The region is important with respect to global climate mitigation efforts as its high energy demand growth has mainly been fuelled by carbon-intensive coal in recent years. Across the globe, &gt;500 GW of coal power is currently under construction or planned 2 , most of it (&gt;89%), located in developing Asia. Once built the planned coal capacity would seriously jeopardize the Paris climate targets 3,4 . Even though it is too early to know how COVID-19 will affect further investment plans, investments in coal can be expected to continue if recovery packages are not increasingly targeted at green investments 5,6 .T o achieve the Paris goals, climate policies will increasingly need to be implemented in low-and middle-income countries.

        <p>Economy-wide carbon pricing is generally seen as the economically most efficient policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 7 . A sufficiently high carbon price would substantially reduce incentives to invest in new coal-fired power plants and could make clean forms of electricity generation, such as renewables, economically competitive. Public support for carbon pricing depends on its distributional effect, that is which parts of the population are affected in which way by the policy 8 . Therefore, policies that directly increase the prices of fossil fuels can be contentious, as demonstrated by protests in France in late 2018 (after an increase of carbon taxes on fuels) as well as in Ecuador in late 2019 (following proposals by the government to cut fossil fuel subsidies).Economy-wide carbon pricing is generally seen as the economically most efficient policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 7 .

        <p>In this paper, we contribute to the understanding of distributional implications of carbon pricing in eight Asian countries which are among those that currently invest most heavily in coal, namely Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. They host 16% of the current global coal capacity and 37% of the global coal pipeline (73% of the pipeline outside China); that is, what is currently under construction and planned (Extended Data Table 1). It is hence highly unlikely that international climate policy will succeed without those countries undertaking efforts to reduce their emissions and avoid future lock-ins.In this paper, we contribute to the understanding of distributional implications of carbon pricing in eight Asian countries which are among those that currently invest most heavily in coal, namely Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.

        <p>At the same time, these countries face substantial challenges to promote human development objectives in line with the agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Some previous studies have analysed the relationship between climate change mitigation (SDG13) and socio-economic development, in particular energy access (SDG7) 9 and the health benefits of reducing ambient air pollution due to fossil fuel combustion (SDG3) 10 . Our study, by contrast, focuses on the distribution of income (SDG10) in a cross-country perspective on the basis of detailed accounts of household carbon footprints derived on the basis of a unified methodology. It hence differs from previous studies that have either looked at individual countries 11 or used a cross-country approach based on highly aggregated data 12 . Some comparable analyses have been undertaken for Latin America 13 as well as the EU 14 but to our knowledge not for Asia. Our paper extends the geographical coverage and provides a detailed analysis of horizontal equity and the distributional effect of different approaches to carbon pricing that were hitherto restricted to single-country studies 15,16 .At the same time, these countries face substantial challenges to promote human development objectives in line with the agenda of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

        <p>Our analyses answer three questions. First, we compare the distributional impacts of different design options for carbon pricing, including an international harmonized carbon price, national economy-wide carbon pricing as well as sectoral carbon prices that only apply to the electricity or transport sector, respectively. Second, we compare the vertical and horizontal distributional effects (across and within income groups) of a national carbon price of US$40 per tCO 2 (which is regarded as the lower bound required to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement 17 ). Note that we focus on a national carbon price as the most efficient option from an economic theory point of view. Third, we analyse why the distributional incidences of national carbon prices differ across countries as a result of differences in spending patterns for different consumption categories.Our analyses answer three questions.

        <p>To understand how different household types would be impacted, we perform microsimulations on the basis of representative household survey data and multiregional input-output (MRIO) data. Survey data are collected from the countries' statistical agencies, harmonized and matched with an environmentally extended MRIO model (Methods and Supplementary Information provide details). Combining both datasets allows us to identify the carbon footprint of households. To assess the distributional impacts of a carbon price, we derive the additional expenditure they would require to maintain their initial consumption. Throughout this analysis we proxy household income by expenditures 20,21 . Our analysis accounts for the effects of higher costs for direct energy use as well as rising prices for goods and services that use energy as inputs in their production (Supplementary Fig. 10 gives a decomposition of those effects). Despite some methodological limitations regarding the matching of household surveys to MRIO data and issues related to data availability, our results appear to be robust under a broad set of alternative specifications (Supplementary Information).To understand how different household types would be impacted, we perform microsimulations on the basis of representative household survey data and multiregional input-output (MRIO) data.

        <p>From a first best point of view, a globally homogenized carbon price would be economically optimal 22 . Arguably, given the political realities, this is unlikely to unfold anytime soon. Yet, some countries have proposed national economy-wide carbon pricing schemes or schemes that target specific sectors. In China, for example, the recently launched emission trading scheme is focusing on the power sector. We hence compare the distributional effects of four different design options for carbon pricing: an internationally harmonized carbon price, a national carbon price, a carbon price that focuses on the electricity sector and a carbon price on liquid fuels, covering mainly the transport sector. We assign households to quintiles on the basis of total per capita expenditures and normalize the median distributional incidences by quintile to the first one (the poorest 20% of the population) to make results comparable across countries and instruments. The shape of distributional incidences therefore is independent of the absolute magnitude-and hence of the level of the carbon price. Instead, it emphasizes whether richer households are more or less strongly affected than poor households (relative to their income).From a first best point of view, a globally homogenized carbon price would be economically optimal 22 .

        <p>In Thailand, where most policies would be regressive, we find a hump-backed shape with the highest impacts on middle class households. A national economy-wide carbon price would be progressive in five countries, neutral in one and mixed or regressive in two (Thailand and Turkey). Hence, whether a certain policy is progressive or regressive, as well as the ranking of different policy instruments with regard to their distributional effects, depends on the specific country context. The analysis in Fig. 1 also allows to measure differences between instruments in terms of their progressivity and the share of households' carbon footprints that would be covered. For example, while a tax on liquid fuels would be highly progressive in India, it would only cover &lt;20% of the country's emissions.In Thailand, where most policies would be regressive, we find a hump-backed shape with the highest impacts on middle class households.

        <p>Arguably, it is also important how households are affected in absolute terms, which is particularly relevant when concerned about the political acceptability of a price reform. Absolute effects vary considerably between the poorest quintiles across countries. In Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines, a US$40 per tCO 2 national carbon price would impact poorest households by ~1%; in India and Thailand, it would be &gt;4% of their expenditures.Arguably, it is also important how households are affected in absolute terms, which is particularly relevant when concerned about the political acceptability of a price reform.

        <p>Figure 2 zooms into the absolute effects of a national US$40 carbon price. Note that Supplementary Tables 15-17 also indicate results for the other instruments discussed above, including international carbon price, transport sector carbon price and electricity sector carbon price. Due to the linearity of the input-output system, these effects can be generalized for different carbon prices by proportional scaling. Despite progressive or neutral distributional effects for most of the countries in the sample, the absolute effects of a carbon price of this magnitude would be substantial. Median values for the poorest quintile are identical to the values indicated in Fig. 1. For example, in India, poor households would need to increase their expenditures by on average 4.5% to maintain their current consumption patterns, while 25% of poor households would even be affected by &gt;5%. The major driving factor for these large welfare impacts in India is the relatively carbon-intensive agricultural sector, mostly regarding the production of rice, wheat, grains, fruits and other crops (Supplementary Table 8), in combination with high expenditure shares for food by Indian households.Figure 2 zooms into the absolute effects of a national US$40 carbon price.

        <p>To better understand the heterogeneity of affected households, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the absolute distributional effects of a US$40 per tCO 2 carbon price for urban as well as rural households. In most countries, rural and urban households would be affected in rather similar ways. However, some notable exceptions exist. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, the rural poor would be least affected by a national carbon price and the urban rich the most. One explanation could be that the countries' poorest households are (1) mostly relying on subsistence farming and traditional fuels (which are difficult to tax) and ( 2) are mostly rural, while urban households-even when belonging to the poorest urban quintile-are still relatively rich compared to the country average (including rural areas). For Turkey, the urban rich show the lowest median impact as well as the lowest spread. That is, a substantially lower fraction of this population group would suffer income losses of &gt;5% compared to the urban poor as well as the rural population. This observation might be due to the fact that in Turkey, which is the richest country in our sample, poorer households spend a higher share of their income on energy-intensive goods and services-a pattern that has been consistently found for industrialized countries 23 .To better understand the heterogeneity of affected households, Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the absolute distributional effects of a US$40 per tCO 2 carbon price for urban as well as rural households.

        <p>Similar to what we find previously for the entire economies, when looking into urban and rural results separately, vertical interquintile differences are generally less pronounced than horizontal intraquintile ones, indicating that specific groups of the society would be particularly affected by carbon prices.Similar to what we find previously for the entire economies, when looking into urban and rural results separately, vertical interquintile differences are generally less pronounced than horizontal intraquintile ones, indicating that specific groups of the society would be particularly affected by carbon prices.</p>
        <p>Of all consumption categories (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figs. 5678) energy is the most carbon-intensive one, hence differences in energy expenditures across quintiles are the main determinant of carbon pricing incidence (Supplementary Fig. 5). All countries show a positive correlation between energy expenditure shares and the incidence of a national carbon price (Supplementary Table 11). Thailand and Turkey are the only countries in which richer households tend to spend a lower share of their income on energy than poorer households, which is in line with the regressive results presented above. Note that Thailand and Turkey are also the richest countries in the sample, which generally tend to show more regressive results 11 . The regressive outcome observed for Thailand and Turkey is exacerbated by a relatively higher carbon intensity of the food sector (of which poorer household consume higher shares; Supplementary Fig. 8). Notably, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh show the least marked correlation (Supplementary Table 11). In these countries, other carbon-intensive expenditure categories also explain distributional effects. For the case of India, the effects correlate with consumption of food and consumption goods. Compared to other countries, in India, these categories are especially carbon-intensive (Supplementary Table 7). Given that poorer households tend to spend relatively more on consumption of goods and food (Supplementary Figs. 3, 7 and8), carbon pricing in India is regressive. Pakistan on the other hand, has the least carbon-intensive food sector in the sample but a carbon-intensive service sector. Services are mostly consumed by richer households (Supplementary Fig. 3), which, together with the (marginally) larger share of energy expenditures, contributes to explaining progressive results.Of all consumption categories (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figs. 5678) energy is the most carbon-intensive one, hence differences in energy expenditures across quintiles are the main determinant of carbon pricing incidence (Supplementary Fig. 5). All countries show a positive correlation between energy expenditure shares and the incidence of a national carbon price (Supplementary Table 11). Thailand and Turkey are the only countries in which richer households tend to spend a lower share of their income on energy than poorer households, which is in line with the regressive results presented above. Note that Thailand and Turkey are also the richest countries in the sample, which generally tend to show more regressive results 11 . The regressive outcome observed for Thailand and Turkey is exacerbated by a relatively higher carbon intensity of the food sector (of which poorer household consume higher shares; Supplementary Fig. 8). Notably, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh show the least marked correlation (Supplementary Table 11). In these countries, other carbon-intensive expenditure categories also explain distributional effects. For the case of India, the effects correlate with consumption of food and consumption goods. Compared to other countries, in India, these categories are especially carbon-intensive (Supplementary Table 7). Given that poorer households tend to spend relatively more on consumption of goods and food (Supplementary Figs. 3, 7 and8), carbon pricing in India is regressive. Pakistan on the other hand, has the least carbon-intensive food sector in the sample but a carbon-intensive service sector. Services are mostly consumed by richer households (Supplementary Fig. 3), which, together with the (marginally) larger share of energy expenditures, contributes to explaining progressive results.</p>
        <p>Within energy expenditures, transport expenditures are related to progressive outcomes (Fig. 3). In all countries, the poorest households spend substantially less for transport as a share of their total expenditures than do richer ones. At the same time, the regressive incidence of a carbon price in Turkey and Thailand correlates with declining shares of electricity expenditures for richer households (Fig. 3). Furthermore, for Turkey, higher expenditure shares on coal for poorer households contribute to the observed regressive outcomes. In countries with higher levels of average income (Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam and Thailand), electricity consumption shares decline with rising total expenditures while they tend to increase with rising expenditure shares in the other countries. The extensive use of biomass-which we consider not to be covered by a carbon price-in some countries can also explain the progressivity. This might be particularly true for Bangladesh where a large part of the poor population does not report expenditures for energy services, implying a high usage rate of non-marketed fuels (Fig. 4). Hence, poorer households, which use a higher share of biomass for their energy services, are less affected by carbon pricing.Within energy expenditures, transport expenditures are related to progressive outcomes (Fig. 3). In all countries, the poorest households spend substantially less for transport as a share of their total expenditures than do richer ones. At the same time, the regressive incidence of a carbon price in Turkey and Thailand correlates with declining shares of electricity expenditures for richer households (Fig. 3). Furthermore, for Turkey, higher expenditure shares on coal for poorer households contribute to the observed regressive outcomes. In countries with higher levels of average income (Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam and Thailand), electricity consumption shares decline with rising total expenditures while they tend to increase with rising expenditure shares in the other countries.

        <p>Large variations in transport-related expenditures are the main determinants of horizontal distributional effects (Fig. 4). This is outstanding for the case of India, for which we find the largest within-quintile variation of carbon pricing incidences for the fifth quintile (Table 1). This large variation is closely related to the large variation in transport expenditures within the fifth quintile (Fig. 4). A similar picture evolves for Indonesia. Looking into solid fuels, such as biomass and coal, biomass expenditures, presumably for cooking purposes, vary starkly for the poorest households in Indonesia and Pakistan. For Turkey, it appears that only specific households within the first quintile consume a large share of coal, presumably for heating. Finally, in all countries, we observe large variations in the expenditure shares for electricity.Large variations in transport-related expenditures are the main determinants of horizontal distributional effects (Fig. 4).

        <p>Comparing eight Asian, coal-investing countries we can unravel the distributional effects of climate policy. Addressing climate change successfully will need to take the social implications of policy measures into account, hence making sure that climate policy will not foster social inequalities. Generally, confirming results from previous studies 11 , we find that progressive outcomes of carbon pricing are more likely to be found in poorer countries. This can partly be explained by changing energy expenditure patterns (Fig. 3). One might argue that introducing climate policy early in the development phase might be easier as it implies fewer implications for social justice. Yet, the findings of our analysis emphasize the heterogeneity of distributional impacts of climate policies across different countries, various policy instruments as well as within individual income groups in each country.Comparing eight Asian, coal-investing countries we can unravel the distributional effects of climate policy.

        <p>To understand how climate policy instruments can be designed in a way that is perceived as socially just, it is important to look beyond the question of whether a certain carbon pricing design would have progressive or regressive distributional impacts 24,25 . Progressive outcomes would still affect households in absolute terms. Carbon pricing schemes have the power to raise revenues (in contrast to most alternatives, such as standards) that can be used to advance sustainable development by lowering distortionary taxes or providing cash transfers for the most affected households 24 . In addition, carbon pricing revenues could also mobilize domestic resources to fund central sustainable development objectives, such as healthcare, education or access to water, sanitation and clean energy 26 .To understand how climate policy instruments can be designed in a way that is perceived as socially just, it is important to look beyond the question of whether a certain carbon pricing design would have progressive or regressive distributional impacts 24,25 .

Yet, it is unlikely that countries are willing (and institutionally capable) to fully recycle revenues back to households. Some have proposed to use existing social transfer schemes to alleviate effects of climate policies 25 . In any case, designing compensation schemes tailored for the specific context in which they are introduced requires a close understanding of the factors that determine which households are most severely affected. Our results indicate that vulnerable population groups might be highly country-specific and most likely tied to specific energy and fuel use, for example the choice of the heating and cooking fuels, whether and how households use electricity and whether households own a motorized vehicle (Figs. 3 and4). How those consumption patterns can be used to devise targeted compensation schemes (or additional policies that ease the transition to clean energies) is a promising area for further research.their household budgets.

        <p>Distributional consequences can be eased, thus raising the social acceptance by measures other than compensation schemes. Regarding electricity, for example, where electricity supply is relatively clean, electricity expenditures do not play a major role for the distributional effects of carbon pricing. By a carbonizing electricity sector (which is likely for all eight countries under consideration) will change the distributional incidence towards more progressivity or regressivity, depending on whether richer or poorer households exhibit higher electricity expenditure shares. Hence, avoiding future carbonization of those countries' energy sectors will also alleviate distributional concerns of introducing climate policies in the future. The literature has identified a role for the international community here, for example by de-risking investments to render clean alternatives more attractive 27 .Distributional consequences can be eased, thus raising the social acceptance by measures other than compensation schemes.

        <p>Differences in electrification rates and biomass use also play a major role in how households are affected by climate policy. In cases in which poor households heavily rely on biomass, the distributional incidence of carbon pricing is probably progressive. However, in such situations carbon pricing might provide incentives to use more biomass 28 , with potential adverse health consequences due to indoor air pollution 29 , and shifts in female labour force and education, as women and children dedicate a larger share of their time to firewood collection 30 . To avoid those potential trade-offs for sustainable development, exempting some fuels that are particularly prone to substitution by traditional biomass (such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking) from carbon pricing or subsidizing clean alternatives, such as fostering the uptake of clean stoves 31 could be ways to address this concern.Differences in electrification rates and biomass use also play a major role in how households are affected by climate policy.

        <p>Finally, while we focus on carbon pricing schemes and their design options, other policy instruments could be used to tackle the electricity sector directly, such as coal moratoria or performance standards. Alternative climate policies, for example standards, moratoria or subsidies in the electricity sector, might face lower public resistance 32 . Yet, the potential subsequent increase in electricity prices can also induce negative distributional consequences for households, which could lead to political opposition to such reforms.

        <p>Matching. A crucial step within our analysis framework is the matching of the highly detailed and region-specific household data with the GTAP sectors. Supplementary Table 1 provides an overview of the different household survey data. Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 list summary statistics for each countries' data. Survey data were collected with the help of standardized surveys during face-to-face visits in single households and are nationally representative.

We thus homogenize the datasets to ensure comparability and report additional cleaning steps in the Supplementary Information. The number of categories of the household data (up to 640 in case of Pakistan) and the GTAP categories (65) differ substantially. Household data need to be aggregated to the sectoral GTAP level for each survey separately. GTAP provides a detailed overview of commodities contained within single sectors 34 . For each regional household survey, we therefore investigate which items belong to which GTAP category (Supplementary Information). m.

        <p>Here we consider (direct and indirect) electricity consumption only. The underlying rationale is that approaches to directly reduce coal use (such as performance standards or moratoria) would probably raise electricity prices. We exchange the emissions vector F in (4) with the monetary electricity output vector EL from GTAP. For all non-electricity sectors, its entries are zero. For all electricity sectors the entries refer to total electricity that is being produced and consumed. We assume that the underlying virtual electricity flows are proportional to monetary flows; that is, that all economic sectors pay the identical price for electricity. We thus derive EEIr 1 s1 , which refers to the amount of money spent on electricity embedded in one unit of household consumption of sector s 1 in country r 1 . As for case 3, we assess the relative distributional implications only (Supplementary Figure 9). Thus, our results do not depend on the size of the electricity price increase.

We identify determinants of distributional effects between expenditures shares by estimating a univariate regression: ac k1 r1 = β 0 + β 1 Share k1,r1,v + ε k1r1 (10) where ac k1 r1 indicates the incidence of a national carbon price for a household k 1 in region r 1 and Share k1,r1,v is the share over total expenditures of the consumption category v where v = {energy, food, goods, services}. We estimate a separate regression for each country and for each consumption category (results for energy, services, goods and food are reported in Supplementary Figs. 5, 6, 7 and 8). We also report the Pearson correlation coefficient between total expenditures and each consumption category v (Supplementary Table 11).Determinants of distributional effects.

        <p>To further analyse why households are impacted differently in each country, we estimate Engel curves 37 using a non-parametric locally weighted regression estimator 38 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). For each country we estimate the relationship between total household expenditures and expenditures shares separately for different types of energy services. Supplementary Table 6 provides an overview of the specific fuels included in each category. Each smoothed density curve refers to the distribution of cost burden as percent of household expenditures for a USD 40 per tCO 2 carbon price (x axis). The y axis displays the share of households within each quintile. Curves are fitted over binned incidence levels with ∆x=0.1%. Solid (dashed) lines refer to urban (rural) households, red (blue) lines refer to the 1 st (5 th ) expenditure quintile. Dots correspond to median values. Note that households were assigned to expenditure quintiles first, that is the number of households for each curve differs. Any given expenditure quintile is the more affected the more its curve is skewed to the right. Households within expenditure quintiles are more heterogeneously affected, if curves are more widespread. Cumulative densities sum up to 100%.To further analyse why households are impacted differently in each country, we estimate Engel curves 37 using a non-parametric locally weighted regression estimator 38 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3).
