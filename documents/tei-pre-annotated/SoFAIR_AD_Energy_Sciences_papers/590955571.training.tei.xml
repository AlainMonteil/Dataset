        <p>The transportation sector was responsible for the emission of 97 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in the UK in 2020 (about 24% of the total greenhouse emissions), making the sector the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the UK [1]. Hydrogen is emerging as a low-and zero-carbon fuel alternative towards the decarbonisation of the transportation sector. Since 1975, the landscape of hydrogen has changed remarkably, as evidenced by the quadruple growth of the global demand for hydrogen (i.e., 73.9 million tonnes in 2018 compared to 18.2 million tonnes in 1975) where, at present, the produced hydrogen is largely used for ammonia (NH 3 ) production and fossil fuel refining [2]. Whilst the current installed hydrogen capacity is relatively small as compared to the market size of other fuels (e.g. natural gas and diesel) and applications (e.g. domestic heating, electricity supply and transportation), there is potential to unlock larger UK markets for hydrogen fuel and applications to meet zero-carbon emissions as the demand for hydrogen continues to grow with technology maturity.The transportation sector was responsible for the emission of 97 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in the UK in 2020 (about 24% of the total greenhouse emissions), making the sector the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the UK [1].

        <p>Creating a hydrogen future has been envisaged as a vision and the pathway towards zero-carbon power sector, buildings, transportation and industry by many countries, including the UK, whilst literature on hydrogen technology from production to application has been extensively published. For the transportation sector, the UK Hydrogen Strategy, which was published in 2021, estimated the potential demand for hydrogen to be between 0 and 6 TW h for 2030, a value that is estimated to reach 20e35 TW h by 2035 [3]. However, before extensively rolling out hydrogen on a large scale, there are still challenges to address, priorities to identify, areas of research to explore and advance, knowledge gaps to bridge and technology readiness to improve. From a research and development perspective, this article investigates the characteristics of the hydrogen-fuelled transportation modes in the UK context, identifying the main characteristics (propulsion, storage and supply chain), advantages and challenges of each transportation mode and presents research areas of priority with the potential to transform the vision for hydrogen-fuelled transportation into reality in the short, medium and long term.Creating a hydrogen future has been envisaged as a vision and the pathway towards zero-carbon power sector, buildings, transportation and industry by many countries, including the UK, whilst literature on hydrogen technology from production to application has been extensively published.

        <p>The current literature lacks comparative studies on the potential of using hydrogen in the different transportation modes, which could be helpful to identify on what priorities industry, academia and government should focus on for the development of hydrogen-fuelled transportation in the UK. As such, this article aims to prioritise areas of research that need to be investigated to enable hydrogen technologies and hydrogen-fuelled transportation in the short, medium and long term in the different transportation modes. Technologies that convert hydrogen fuel into power for transportation application presents technologies that convert hydrogen fuel into power for transportation application proposes. In the present context of the UK and based on the literature review, Hydrogen-fuelled transportation for different modes describes the use of hydrogen for transportation for road, aviation, maritime and rail applications, covering aspects from the current status of development, characteristics and supply chain (hydrogen production, purification, storage, distribution and refuelling infrastructure). Critical analysis and future research areas of hydrogen-fuelled transportation modes presents a critical review of the use of hydrogen in the different transportation modes, highlighting and comparing the main characteristics, advantages and challenges to recognise the specific and common research areas that are required to stimulate the widespread adoption of hydrogen in the short, medium, and long term.

        <p>Fuel cells (FCs) convert hydrogen into electrical energy. As such, hydrogen FC vehicles have an electric drivetrain, similar to battery electric vehicles, but their energy input is provided Nomenclature by hydrogen stored onboard the vehicles. They present similar range and refuelling characteristics to conventional vehicles [4]. Energy is released from hydrogen using an onboard FC stack without tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions. This is because the only by-product of the FC reaction is water, which is generally released into the atmosphere. To maintain an efficient reaction, operational parameters of FCs, such as temperature, current density, humidity, reactant ratio and pressure, must be controlled [5]. Additional power for cooling FC stacks is required. On shutdown, FC stacks have to remove water from the stack to prevent freezing [6].Fuel cells (FCs) convert hydrogen into electrical energy.

        <p>FC technologies include (but are not limited to) alkaline, proton exchange membrane (PEM), solid oxide, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate (MC), and direct methanol FCs. Their fuel, efficiency, cost, and lifetime are summarised in Table 1. Among all, PEM FCs are the most suitable for transportation applications due to their high reactivity, ability to cold start, high energy density and low weight. However, they are prone to hydrogen impurities due to low operating temperatures and require complex water management, which increases their maintenance cost and reduces their lifetime [7].FC technologies include (but are not limited to) alkaline, proton exchange membrane (PEM), solid oxide, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate (MC), and direct methanol FCs.

        <p>Hydrogen can also be combusted by internal combustion engines (ICEs) to produce drive power for transportation. Similar to conventional natural gas-fuelled ICEs (also referred to as gas engines or single gas fuel engines), hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engines (H 2 ICEs) operate based on the Otto cycle principle [8]. H 2 ICEs share the common operational challenges faced by conventional gas engines which are related to air-to-fuel ratio, intake temperature, engine knocking and NOx formation as well as additional issues, such as (i) high flame speed and low ignition energy, leading to a steep rise in cylinder pressure and possible pre-ignition of fuel, and therefore potential explosion inside the engines, (ii) higher combustion temperature in hydrogen engines, leading to higher NOx formation rates, which can be addressed by exhaust gas recirculation and catalytic reduction filters (well established technologies for conventional engines), and (iii) smaller engine output power and torque due to the less space available in the cylinders and combustion chamber for air intake, as a result of the lower volumetric energy density of hydrogen [9]. As such, to burn hydrogen as the only fuel input, modifications on conventional gas engines are required [10]. To date, two adaptation strategies have been suggested to solve the problem that hydrogen could self-ignite due to its low self-igniting temperature and result in premature ignition, leading to knocking effects. They include (i) direct injection (DI), which works by injecting liquid hydrogen (LH 2 ) at high pressure during the combustion cycle (because low temperature avoids self-ignition) and (ii) injection with gas valves, which works by injecting hydrogen at high pressures when the intake cycle begins. In addition, the injection of liquid or pressurised hydrogen is also introduced to solve the problem of less space being available for air intake, although this results in a smaller power output.Hydrogen can also be combusted by internal combustion engines (ICEs) to produce drive power for transportation.

        <p>Alternatively, hydrogen can be combusted by conventional dual-fuel ICEs, which are compression engines that require no modification on the fuel injection system but a hydrocarbon pilot fuel to ignite the fuel [10]. The engines operate by burning either 100% liquid fuel (e.g. diesel, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and methane) or a mixture of gas hydrogen and liquid fuel at A lifetime of 5000 h corresponds to a mileage of 150,000e200,000 km [17].Alternatively, hydrogen can be combusted by conventional dual-fuel ICEs, which are compression engines that require no modification on the fuel injection system but a hydrocarbon pilot fuel to ignite the fuel [10].

During the gas mode, the lean-burn Otto cycle applies where the air-hydrogen mixture is compressed and ignited by a pilot fuel, i.e., a small quantity of liquid fuel (approximately 1e15% of the total fuel input) which is injected into the combustion chamber. During the liquid fuel mode, the Diesel cycle applies where liquid fuel is injected into the combustion chamber at high pressure for combustion [11].i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x x various portions.

        <p>Gas and steam turbines are alternative technologies that can convert hydrogen into drive power. Gas turbines consist of built-in compressors, combustors, compressor turbines and power turbines and operate based on the Brayton cycle principle [12]. Compared to diesel-fuelled gas turbines, hydrogenfuelled gas turbines show lower efficiency, lower fuel flow rates and consequently increased mass flow rates of air and exhaust due to the differences in fuel properties [9]. This necessitates modifications on the compressor and turbines to accommodate different flow rates for optimal performance [13]. On the other hand, steam turbines work in proximity to boilers, condensers and pumps, and make use of boil-off gas (i.e., the outcome of the natural evaporation of hydrogen where LH 2 storage tanks are not perfectly insulated [14]) or hydrogen. Combustion turbines are prone to issues such as metal deterioration and steam/stress corrosion cracking when they burn pure hydrogen at high temperatures [15], making the choice of materials an important aspect to consider during turbine design.Gas and steam turbines are alternative technologies that can convert hydrogen into drive power.

        <p>FC and H 2 ICE vehicles have been developed for road transportation. The main advantages of FC vehicles are the higher fuel conversion efficiency and the low noise, although a higher hydrogen purity is required for the operation of the FC. A 99.97% purity for both gas hydrogen (Grade D) and LH 2 (Grade B) is required for FC vehicles, while a 98% purity for gas hydrogen (Grade A) is required for H 2 ICEs [26]. H 2 ICEs have a lower peak fuel conversion efficiency than FCs. Their average fuel conversion efficiency is more than 35% whereas their peak fuel conversion efficiency could be more than 50% if they are coupled to a hybrid powertrain [65]. On the other hand, H 2 ICE vehicles take the advantage of traditional gas engines and present the potential for dual-fuel operation, although these vehicles are characterised by high fuel consumption, potential emissions of harmful NO X , wide flammability limits, low minimum ignition energy of hydrogen and are noisier than FC vehicles [27]. i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x xFC and H 2 ICE vehicles have been developed for road transportation.

        <p>Light-duty vehicles, such as cars, taxis and vans, were responsible for 68.7% of the total domestic emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020 [1]. Currently, hydrogen-fuelled commercial vehicles are available on the UK market with limited demand [28]. The schematics of the powertrain of current hydrogen-fuelled cars (i.e., FC and H 2 ICEs cars) together with a brief description of their main components, characteristics, advantages and drawbacks are illustrated in Fig. 2.Light-duty vehicles, such as cars, taxis and vans, were responsible for 68.7% of the total domestic emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020 [1].

        <p>Fig. 3(a) illustrates the state-of-the-art hydrogen production, storage, distribution, refuelling and use for automotive application. Hydrogen can either be produced off-site (centralised production) or on-site. Centralised production involves bulk quantities of hydrogen, taking advantage of economies of scale and removing the need for costly compressors if hydrogen is delivered at required pressures.Fig. 3(a) illustrates the state-of-the-art hydrogen production, storage, distribution, refuelling and use for automotive application.

        <p>However, it has higher transmission and distribution costs and relies on infrastructure readiness, e.g. road transport, pipelines, refuelling stations, etc. On the other hand, on-site production minimises transmission and distribution costs, although requires more energy and potentially larger space for on-site production and compression and its levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) tends to be higher than centralised production [11]. To provide low-cost hydrogen, hydrogen production technologies integrated with carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) using fossil fuels as feedstocks are suitable in the short term whilst moving towards deeper market penetration of zero-carbon emission technologies, such as water electrolysis utilising renewable energy sources and cheaper materials for PEM electrolysers.However, it has higher transmission and distribution costs and relies on infrastructure readiness, e.g. road transport, pipelines, refuelling stations, etc. On the other hand, on-site production minimises transmission and distribution costs, although requires more energy and potentially larger space for on-site production and compression and its levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) tends to be higher than centralised production [11].

        <p>When hydrogen is produced at a central facility, it can be transported to the hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) via (i) carbon steel pipelines for hydrogen-natural gas blends, (ii) fibre reinforced polymer pipelines for gaseous hydrogen, (iii) gas tube trailers for compressed hydrogen (CH 2 ) gas, (iv) container trucks for chemical or metal hydrides (MHs), (v) cryo-compressed trailers for cold-or cryo-compressed hydrogen (CcH 2 ) and (vi) liquid tankers for LH 2 . When CH 2 is distributed to and dispensed at a HRS in the same form, there are four refuelling strategies that may be applied, namely cascade storage, constant pressure, booster compressor and direct dispensing [34,35]. A recently developed strategy called vessel consolidation shows the potential to meet compression demand at a 60% reduced cost using a smaller compressor [36]. The choice of refuelling strategies is also made in line with how hydrogen is produced and distributed and the pressures required. With excess renewable energy sources, on-site hydrogen production may be favourable due to reduced costs that will be otherwise spent on hydrogen distribution. When CH 2 is produced on-site at the required pressures, it can be supplied directly to a dispensing unit. When LH 2 is distributed to and/or stored on-site at a refuelling station, it can be converted by a cryo-pump into high pressure compressed gas for dispensing, if required [35].When hydrogen is produced at a central facility, it can be transported to the hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) via (i) carbon steel pipelines for hydrogen-natural gas blends, (ii) fibre reinforced polymer pipelines for gaseous hydrogen, (iii) gas tube trailers for compressed hydrogen (CH 2 ) gas, (iv) container trucks for chemical or metal hydrides (MHs), (v) cryo-compressed trailers for cold-or cryo-compressed hydrogen (CcH 2 ) and (vi) liquid tankers for LH 2 .

        <p>Table 2 illustrates the current operating and planned HRSs in the UK, which predominantly have a capacity of lower than 100 kg H 2 /day with limited geographical availability. As such, to stimulate the future roll-out of hydrogen-fuelled transportation in the UK, the development of larger capacity HRS (more than 1000 kg H 2 /day) will be required [37]. The capacity of hydrogen refuelling stations affects the choice of hydrogen distribution strategy and vice versa. For instance, pipelines and liquid tankers are ideal for HRSs which can dispense more than 500 kg H 2 /day, gas tube trailers are suitable for small capacities (between 50 and 100 kg H 2 /day), while on-site hydrogen production through steam reforming and electrolysis can be carried out for both [38]. FC and H 2 ICE vehicles could share the same hydrogen production, transportation and distribution supply chain and, as such, the development of one would support the development of the other [39]. The maximisation of the use of the HRS, the reduction of the capital and operating cost and public and policy support are required to increase the economic performance of HRSs.Table 2 illustrates the current operating and planned HRSs in the UK, which predominantly have a capacity of lower than 100 kg H 2 /day with limited geographical availability.

        <p>Fig. 3(b) illustrates the technologies that are applicable for hydrogen storage onboard cars. Technical issues that limit hydrogen storage onboard cars include low energy density, high operating pressure of CH 2 , poor efficiency, expensive catalysts, low response rates, stability and risk of violent reactions [31]. Whilst CH 2 at 700 bar in Type IV is the common choice for hydrogen storage onboard vehicles and has been adopted by FC car manufacturers for Hyundai ix35 (PEM FC stack power of 100 kW and storage of 5.63 kg of CH 2 at 700 bar for a driving range of 594 km [33]), Toyota Mirai (PEM FC stack power of 128 kW and storage of 5 kg of CH 2 at 700 bar for a driving range of 647 km [33]) and Honda Clarity (PEM FC stack power of 100 kW and storage of 5.46 kg of CH 2 at 700 bar for a driving range of 480 km [33]), storing LH 2 onboard cars has also been trialled in a few prototypes, such as the Necar 4 model by Daimler (storage capacity of 70 L to drive a 70 kW FC) [42], the Bora HyMotion model by Volkswagen (storage capacity of 50 L to drive a 75 kW FC) [43] and the HydroGen 3 (storage capacity of 68 L) [44]. Prototypes of other storage options for FC car applications have also been showcased, such as cryocompressed storage, which was used in the i8 FC model developed by BMW (storage capacity of 7.2 kg at À220 C and up to 350 bar to power a 90 kW FC for a 500 km driving range) [45], MHs storage, which was used in the Miata and Demio models by Mazda [46], and borohydride storage, i.e. sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ) in water, which was tested in the Daimler Chrysler Natrium model and the Ford Mercury Sable reconverted by Team New Jersey [47]. Batteries are used in the current layout of FC cars to assist power [33], as in the case of the Toyota Mirai, which employs a lithium-ion (Li-ion) highvoltage battery that is located behind the rear seats in the vehicle.

        <p>For H 2 ICE vehicles (either only hydrogen or dual fuel), no commercial models are currently available on the market [49]. BMW developed between 2003 and 2007 a dual-fuel vehicle equipped with a 6 L twelve-cylinder high-pressure DI engine fuelled with LH 2 (storage capacity of 8 kg) [50]. Following that, Mazda developed the dual-fuel RX-8 Hydrogen RE (2003) and Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid (2005e2007) cars that used a twin-rotor Wankel rotary engine (which is beneficial to limit the problem of backfiring with hydrogen combustion) supplied by gasoline or CH 2 stored at 350 bar [49]. More recently, Toyota started the testing of a Corolla Cross H 2 ICE car equipped with a 1.6 L three-cylinder high-pressure DI turbo engine. The first tests of the vehicle showed performance similar to that of ICEs due to the increased hydrogen combustion power and torque that was achieved, together with a long driving range and reduced refuelling time (as low as 90 s) [51].For H 2 ICE vehicles (either only hydrogen or dual fuel), no commercial models are currently available on the market [49].

        <p>Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), i.e. all commercial trucks with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of over 3500 kg or 3.5 tonnes, were responsible for 19.2% of the total domestic emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020 [1]. Hydrogen-fuelled trucks are an appealing low-carbon alternative to conventional medium-and heavy-duty trucks running on petroleum fuel diesel, which are responsible for large CO 2 emissions due to their low fuel efficiency, long driving range and high idling time [54]. Compared to cars, hydrogen-fuelled trucks require (i) constant power during the entire period of transportation, (ii) a smaller number of HRSs due to the return-to-base operation, (iii) low manufacturing volume, which results in a lower difference in capital cost between conventional and hydrogen-fuelled trucks compared to cars, (iv) high energy density to increase the driving range of trucks and (v) high vehicle longevity (25,000e30,000 h for trucks as opposed to 8000 h for cars) [32,55].

        <p>The state-of-the-art hydrogen supply chain for hydrogenfuelled trucks is illustrated in Fig. 5. Hydrogen for truck applications can be produced at a centralised facility or locally at a HRS. Centralised production at a local facility may be more cost-efficient than on-site production for a market with low demand, as production equipment can be operated for a high number of hours with a high system utilisation rate [58]. Onsite production is likely to be only feasible for small to medium stations (up to 400 kg/day) due to the power and space Fig. 4 e Schematics and comparison of hydrogen-fuelled (i.e., FC and H 2 ICEs) trucks [32,33,54,56,57].The state-of-the-art hydrogen supply chain for hydrogenfuelled trucks is illustrated in Fig. 5.

        <p>Compared to vehicles, a larger quantity of hydrogen is required for the refuelling of hydrogen-fuelled trucks, which ranges from 32 kg of CH 2 at 350 bar for the Hyundai Xcient (for a driving range up to 400 km) up to 70 kg of CH 2 at 700 bar for the truck Nikola Tre (for a driving range up to 800 km, which manufacturing is under development by Nikola Motors in collaboration with Iveco [64]. As such, higher capacity HRSs are mandatory for the refuelling of hydrogen-fuelled trucks and the development of the transportation mode. Assuming a refilling capacity of 60 kg, a HRS would require 2400 kg of hydrogen per day to refill 40 trucks [65]. The hydrogen refuelling process for onboard CH 2 storage is standardised (SAE J2601-2) for trucks and buses with over 10 kg onboard hydrogen storage. Communication between the dispenser and tanks sets the refuelling rate, which depends on the initial temperature, tank pressure and pre-cooling strategy. For fast refuelling at 700 bar, a pre-cooling unit is required to cool the hydrogen to 233 K (À40 C). On the other hand, refuelling at 350 bar does not require a pre-cooling unit, reducing station complexity and energy requirements [35,58]. Current research is investigating technologies to increase the average and peak refuelling rate of CH 2 up to 10 kg/min and 20 kg/min, respectively, which could be beneficial not only for truck application but also for the aviation and maritime industry [66].Compared to vehicles, a larger quantity of hydrogen is required for the refuelling of hydrogen-fuelled trucks, which ranges from 32 kg of CH 2 at 350 bar for the Hyundai Xcient (for a driving range up to 400 km) up to 70 kg of CH 2 at 700 bar for the truck Nikola Tre (for a driving range up to 800 km, which manufacturing is under development by Nikola Motors in collaboration with Iveco [64].

        <p>Daimler Truck and Linde AG are currently developing an advanced LH 2 storage system, called subcooled liquid hydrogen (sLH 2 ), in their H 2 Gen truck [65] with production expected from 2027. The increased maximum working pressure of sLH 2 (from 4 bar to 20 bar) would allow to achieve a larger energy density and reduced hydrogen evaporation for a longer time [67]. In addition, the technology is expected to have large hydrogen storage capacity (more than 80 kg), high flow rate (400e500 kg of hydrogen per hour for each pump) and low energy demand for refuelling (0.05 kW h per kg of hydrogen as opposed to 1.5 kW h for CH 2 at 700 bar) and lower HRS footprint [65,68]. CcH 2 storage could also be a suitable alternative for truck applications [69]. Initially developed by BMW for hydrogen-fuelled cars, cryo-compressed technology represents a hybrid solution between LH 2 and CH 2 that uses cold temperatures (between 20 and 50 K) and relatively high pressure (up to 300 bar) for hydrogen storage. By doing that, CcH 2 storage can eliminate the boil-off losses (which are present with LH 2 ) and have high energy storage density [70]. Additional advantages include the reduction in cost for carbon fibre cost compared to CH 2 stored in Type IV storage tanks (which cost can be significant for the large storage volumes required in trucks) [70] and the more robust refuelling process with reduced losses compared to sLH 2 refuelling [65]. The company Cryomotive is currently working on the implementation of the storage technology for truck application [65]. MHs are less favourable for onboard storage in trucks due to their heavy weight, which may hamper performance and limit the payload.Daimler Truck and Linde AG are currently developing an advanced LH 2 storage system, called subcooled liquid hydrogen (sLH 2 ), in their H 2 Gen truck [65] with production expected from 2027.

As a short term solution for the decarbonisation of the transportation sector, dual-fuel hydrogen trucks are based on the reconversion of diesel trucks by retrofitting the fuel injection system and the onboard hydrogen storage [71]. In recent years, the UK company ULEMCo has worked on the retrofitting of heavy-duty trucks for dual-fuel use with hydrogen in combination with diesel or hydrate vegetable oil (HVO), which was used in a waste collection truck [72].

        <p>Buses were responsible for 2% of the total domestic emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020 [1]. Currently, only 2% of the UK bus fleets operation are zero-carbon emission [76], showing the potential for the decarbonisation of the sector. Low-carbon buses can be powered by hydrogen-fuelled FCs and have been demonstrated over the last twenty years, with the first hydrogen bus using a FC realised by Ballard in 1993 [77], and several buses have been trialled in the UK. PEM FCs are considered the most suitable for bus applications. In comparison, alkaline FCs are less efficient and require pure oxygen, phosphoric acid FCs are heavy due to low power density and MC and solid oxide FCs involve high and very high operating temperatures, respectively.Buses were responsible for 2% of the total domestic emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020 [1].

        <p>Early bus trials used FCs as the only energy source and found a few operational issues, i.e., failure to meet the power requirements of buses due to poor dynamic response, shorter lifespan, and damage to FCs due to acceleration and deceleration. As such, hybrid FC buses, as illustrated in Fig. 6, were developed, which can reduce FC size, fuel consumption and overall costs (from 18.4 to 29.1 kg H 2 /100 km to less than 10 kg H 2 /100 km) [78]. In this type of bus, an auxiliary energy storage system (ESS), such as a battery and/or a supercapacitor, is kept charged using electricity from the hydrogen FC. The FC provides continuous energy and, under low loads, is used to power the motor. During peak power demand, the ESS is discharged, reducing transient loads of the FC [79]. The power control unit can charge the battery/supercapacitor, power the motor or do both [80]. The auxiliary ESS allows brake energy to be recovered and the FC to operate near peak efficiency, extending its lifetime and increasing fuel economy [81]. As optimal sizing for cost minimisation varies with drive cycle, average speed and start and stop [82], buses designed for a specific route can reduce lifetime costs. Drive cycles with higher average speeds and fewer stops have a larger optimal FC stack power size (80 kW) than those with lower average speeds (40 kW).Early bus trials used FCs as the only energy source and found a few operational issues, i.e., failure to meet the power requirements of buses due to poor dynamic response, shorter lifespan, and damage to FCs due to acceleration and deceleration.

        <p>Four naturally aspirated and ten turbocharged H 2 ICE buses were trialled in a project called HyFLEET [85], which showed a fuel consumption of 21.6 kg/100 km, a net weight of 12e12.9 tonnes, a driving range longer than 200 km, an engine output of 150e200 kW at 2 rpm and a hydrogen storage capacity of 50 kg. It was found that (i) fuel injectors for turbocharged would cause considerable downtime and (ii) unlike climate conditions which have a marginal impact, both traffic conditions and passenger load would affect the fuel consumption of buses by ±20% [85].

Hydrogen bus fleets provide predictable demand with back-to-back operation and high utilisation rates for HRSs, enabling the development of refuelling infrastructure. Whilst infrastructure requirements at bus depots vary with the options of hydrogen storage, distribution and onboard bus application, most refuelling stations in Europe receive CH 2 from tube trailers and require compressors on site to meet the required 350 bar refuelling pressure [74].

As shown in Fig. 7, there are three pathways to use hydrogen for aviation purposes [92]: (i) using hydrogen to power FCs (for propulsive, auxiliary and/or emergency power use), (ii) using LH 2 as a fuel for combustion engines and (iii) producing sustainable aviation fuels from hydrogen, e.g. synthetic hydrocarbon fuels such as synthetic kerosene-like fuel (synfuel) using power-to-liquid methods and CCUS.Domestic aviation was responsible for 0.5% of the total domestic emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020, while international aviation accounted for 11.8% of the total emissions of the transportation sector in the UK in 2020 [1].

        <p>The electrical energy supplied by hydrogen FCs onboard an aircraft can be used to drive (i) electric motors for propulsion, (ii) auxiliary power units (APUs) for auxiliary applications, such as starting the main engines and supporting ground operations e.g. taxiing, lighting, de-icing, cabin air conditioning or heating, pressurising and providing passenger entertainment modules and (iii) emergency power units (EPUs), as a contingency plan. APUs and EPUs produce approximately 20% of airport ground emissions, making them key components to decarbonise. FCs show a good prospect of replacing traditional kerosene-fuelled, gas-turbine powered APUs or EPUs [93e95] in the short term (within the next 10 years). This is because (i) the efficiency of gas-turbine powered APUs, i.e. 30e40% during flight and 20% for ground operations, is lower than that of FCs and (ii) research and development on FCs show the potential to offer lower weights whilst achieving higher system efficiencies [93]. In addition, NOx emissions can be reduced by 100%, although the hydrogen FC pathway will release approximately 2.5 times more water vapour than the traditional kerosene-fuelled option [96]. Hydrogen FCs should be integrated with batteries onboard the aircraft, which will provide energy storage to enable fast loading and power peak shaving at the optimal size of the FC system [96]. This is possible in the short term provided that immediate infrastructural change is made to enable fast charging in airports.

Hydrogen FCs should be integrated with batteries onboard the aircraft, which will provide energy storage to enable fast loading and power peak shaving at the optimal size of the FC system [96]. This is possible in the short term provided that immediate infrastructural change is made to enable fast charging in airports. Among all FC technologies, alkaline, PEM, solid oxide, and direct methanol FCs have been identified as suitable for Fig. 7 e Three pathways to use hydrogen for aviation, adapted from Ref. [92].</p>

        <p>LH 2 has long been considered as a jet fuel since the 1970s [97] and investigated for airbuses in the 2000s [98]. The basic concept of a hydrogen combustion engine is much the same as current kerosene engines [99]: prior to entering the combustion chamber, LH 2 is heated by a heat exchanger using heat recovered from hot-spots in the jet engines e.g. exhaust, compressors, combustion chambers and turbines. This vaporises the hydrogen which is then combusted with oxygen in the engines to power turbines and fans, resulting in thrust to drive the aeroplane forwards as shown in Fig. 8. To accommodate differing properties of hydrogen combustion and operate at lower temperatures onboard aircraft, new engines must be designed or conventional engines must be modified. When compared to conventional kerosene engines, LH 2 powered engines can have ~64% lower specific fuel consumption and are expected to improve efficiency by 1e5% in creating thrust [100]. However, their efficiency is lower compared to the use of hydrogen to power FCs for propulsion, i.e., 40% as opposed to 45e50% [92]. NOx formation, which depends on residence time in the combustion chamber and temperature at which combustion takes place, is a key issue associated with combustion engines. If combustion engines burn hydrogen instead of kerosene, NOx emissions could be reduced by 50e80% (and release 2.5 times more water vapour, which is similar to the hydrogen FC pathway) [96]. With effective engine redesign which incorporates technologies such as micromix combustion, LH 2 powered engines operating at lower temperatures would only emit 0.005e0.0139% of NOx emissions of conventional aircraft [100,101]. Micromix combustion uses cross-flows to mix air and gaseous hydrogen to create "multiple miniaturized diffusion-type flames" and eliminate the risk of flashback [102]. Lean direct injection, which applies a similar principle as micromix combustion, has been explored but found to produce the same amount of NOx as conventional aircraft [101].LH 2 has long been considered as a jet fuel since the 1970s [97] and investigated for airbuses in the 2000s [98].

        <p>Liquid or cryogenic hydrogen storage onboard aircraft requires four times the volume for the same energy content provided by kerosene. This causes a design challenge as conventional aircraft store fuel in the wings, which is no longer possible for LH 2 due to the higher volume requirements. Novel aircraft designs as shown in Fig. 8(a) are necessary to meet these requirements. Changes to the aircraft structure are necessary to accommodate cryogenic fuel tanks and fuel lines onboard the aircraft. Blended wing body can increase fuel storage capacity in the wings, improve energy efficiency (31.5% and 40% using state-of-art technologies and future engine technologies, respectively) and reduce noise [103]. The company Airbus has recently announced the launch of their demonstration aircraft ZEROe, which uses the platform of the large wide-body airliner A380 to accommodate four hydrogen storage tanks that supply LH 2 to the ICE that is located along the rear fuselage. The aircraft could become available for commercial operation by 2035 [104]. The real benefits of LH 2 combustion in aviation come for long-range flights, in which the lower mass of LH 2 (compared to kerosene) can reduce 25% of the total weight of the aircraft (inclusive of the mass of the cryogenic storage system), leading to up to 11% improvement in efficiency [105,106]. Additionally, the lower specific fuel capacity of cryogenic engines could reduce fuel costs if cost parity between hydrogen and kerosene is achieved [100].Liquid or cryogenic hydrogen storage onboard aircraft requires four times the volume for the same energy content provided by kerosene.

        <p>To accommodate the volume of liquid or cryogenic hydrogen required at airports, infrastructure needs to be developed. One option for hydrogen supply is from a centralised production facility where hydrogen is distributed via a national hydrogen grid. In this case, hydrogen would be piped either in gaseous or liquid form to the airport. If hydrogen is in gaseous form, airports must have the capacity to liquefy it. The large volume of hydrogen fuel required indicates that pipelines are the more logistically suitable option for gateway international airports because, if the whole quantity of fuel required is delivered by gas tube trailers or liquid tankers, there would be congestion that would make the process of delivery unfeasible. However, if gas tube trailers or liquid tankers are chosen for gaseous or LH 2 delivery to local, regional and gateway international airports, decoupling airport demand from the national grid may be a way to mitigate congestion issues with supply and demand at peak times. This requires on-site production of hydrogen at airports or specific production facilities located close to airports, whereas airports could store large quantities of hydrogen on-site at times of low demand to be used at times of high demand. In all cases, liquid tankers with cryogenic storage containers could deliver LH 2 to the aircraft as they do with kerosene currently. Alternatively, dedicated underground piping systems could deliver hydrogen directly to aircraft in refuelling bays. Airbus and Ariane group are currently working on the realisation of the first of a kind HRS refuelling LH 2 for aviation application, which is expected to be operational in 2025 and will be used to refuel the demonstrator ZEROe aircraft [107].To accommodate the volume of liquid or cryogenic hydrogen required at airports, infrastructure needs to be developed.

        <p>Moving to hydrogen fuel for aircraft propulsion is a long term goal. In the short term, airports could power ground support equipment, such as forklift trucks and baggage tugs, from stationary hydrogen FC technologies. Ground support equipment was responsible for the emission of ~6 Mt of CO 2 emissions in 2020 [20]. Examples of moving towards hydrogen technology to power fork-lift trucks or baggage tugs have been showcased by Amazon, Walmart and Plug Power [20], proving their cost competitiveness when compared to conventional battery or combustion engines powered by diesel, kerosene, natural gas etc. Whilst replacing or retrofitting ground support equipment to be powered by hydrogen FCs is viable, the low availability and relatively high cost of green hydrogen present the main challenges.

        <p>Similar to the conventional diesel mechanical power plant, the H 2 ICEs incorporated into a hydrogen-fuelled power system would be of different sizes where larger H 2 ICEs operate to meet full power demand when the vessels transit at sea and smaller H 2 ICEs are run to meet part loads when the vessels manoeuvre and wait in the harbours [113]. The excess waste heat from H 2 ICEs could be recovered to vaporise LH 2 and allow using a smaller evaporator. H 2 ICEs are the more viable option for international shipping until FC technology becomes more cost-competitive and has the capacity to enable long-distance transits [111]. As reported in Technologies that convert hydrogen fuel into power for transportation application, conventional gas turbines must be modified to accommodate the properties of hydrogen.

        <p>Compared to H 2 ICEs, deploying large-scale FCs onboard seagoing vessels is more complex. This is because FC power plants involve the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy and are physically larger i.e., requiring almost double the space used by the H 2 ICE alternative, which poses an issue for smaller vessels under 2 MW [117,118]. Currently, FC technology suits small vessels that commute along short routes with frequent visits to the same ports. Of all FC technologies, PEM and solid oxide FCs are mostly suitable for maritime use [119]. For PEM FCs used for maritime application, one of the challenges is that the exposition of the cathode to sea air could produce the degradation of the polymer membrane, which would require the pre-treatment of the air to remove sodium chloride (NaCl) vapours [120]. Alternatively, FCs can be used as APUs for maritime application, as in the case of the Viking Lady ship, which used a MC FC fuelled by LNG [120].Compared to H 2 ICEs, deploying large-scale FCs onboard seagoing vessels is more complex.

        <p>Currently, commercial application of hydrogen for maritime application is very rare and limited to small boats, for instance the Hydrogenesis Passenger Ferry (with a capacity of 2 crews and 12 passengers) which operates commercially in Bristol, UK [121]. Whilst there is no current commercial hydrogen application available for seagoing vessels [14], the general consensus is that hydrogen would have niche use for specific applications, such as roll-on roll-off passenger ferries and cruise vessels in the short to medium term, as evidenced by the two demonstration projects in the UK: (i) Hydrogen Diesel Injection in a Marine Environment (HyDIME) which demonstrated the production of hydrogen from wind and tidal power via electrolysis to run diesel and H 2 ICE onboard a commercial ferry that operated in the Orkney Islands [122] and (ii) HySeas IeIII which designed and demonstrated the operation of a hydrogen-electric hybrid system integrating PEM FCs and batteries for a passenger vessel that commuted between Kirkwall and Shapinsay in the Orkney Islands [123].Currently, commercial application of hydrogen for maritime application is very rare and limited to small boats, for instance the Hydrogenesis Passenger Ferry (with a capacity of 2 crews and 12 passengers) which operates commercially in Bristol, UK [121].

        <p>Existing commercial vessels would continue to operate for decades as the lifespan of seagoing vessels is 30 years on average. To reduce or eliminate their carbon footprint, a switch to hydrogen fuel can be achieved by retrofitting existing marine power plants. Such retrofit is expensive and requires the redesign of marine power systems onboard the vessels. Factors, such as hydrogen storage capacity onboard vessels, hydrogen infrastructure available for bunkering, the number of voyages and port calls and economic implications, should be considered during retrofit design, as suggested by Mao et al. [124]. An example of retrofitting is the Tranship II project, which aims to retrofit the Prince Madog ship with a hydrogen hybrid propulsion system that works in combination with a diesel-fuelled main engine [125]. For both retrofit and new-build system designs, onboard hydrogen storage requires remarkable space and presents a key challenge. The storage tanks can be spherical or cylindrical and made of aluminium alloy, steel or carbon fibres with thermal insulation (to minimise heat loss) where the storage pressure may range between 200 and 700 bar [10]. CH 2 stored in cylindrical tanks at high pressures is less advantageous for marine applications due to its smaller storage capacity (which requires refuelling of the storage tanks more frequently) and complexity in handling high pressures. On the other hand, when hydrogen is produced onboard and/or consumed at high flow rates with less frequency of refuelling over a longer storage period, storing LH 2 in spherical tanks at temperatures between À253 and À239 C (i.e., the boiling and critical points of hydrogen) and atmospheric pressure is more beneficial, as this offers the possibility to store the maximum quantity of hydrogen at the minimum volume [112]. Due to the significant difference between ambient and hydrogen storage temperatures, the formation of hydrogen boil-off gas is unavoidable but can be minimised by thermal insulation of the storage tanks, which results in more weight (double to quadruple the weight of diesel tanks) [13]. The increased weight will be trivial for large ships with a deadweight tonnage (DWT) greater than 100,000 tonnes whose fuel tank weight is 1e2% of the DWT [126].Existing commercial vessels would continue to operate for decades as the lifespan of seagoing vessels is 30 years on average.

        <p>Fig. 10 illustrates technologies envisaged for hydrogen production, distribution, bunkering, onboard storage and power conversion for seagoing marine vessels in the short term. Hydrogen production facilities can be located either at an off-site location, on-site at the ports or onboard marine vessels. If hydrogen is produced off-site, it should locate as closer as possible to ports that provide bunkering services for a lower hydrogen transportation cost. When the distance between hydrogen production facilities and the ports is less than 300 km, gas tube trailers are more likely to be used unless the cost of hydrogen transportation via liquid tankers can offset that of hydrogen liquefaction [127]. At ports, hydrogen is stored in the form of a liquid or a gas, whereas LH 2 could make use of existing LNG infrastructure. Bunkering is a key issue for marine vessels that do not have the facility to produce hydrogen onboard [126]. When hydrogen is transferred to marine vessels during bunkering, the options are [128]: (i) delivering and storing hydrogen in a gaseous form, where the pressure of gaseous hydrogen is adjusted through compression or pressure balancing for higher or lower pressure respectively; (ii) delivering gaseous hydrogen and storing in a liquid form, which requires hydrogen liquefaction prior to storage and (iii) delivering and storing hydrogen it in a liquid form, which requires a cryogenic pump. When dealing with CH 2 , it is critical to control the flow rate of hydrogen, as the heat that is released during adiabatic compression may soften the pressure vessels and lead to catastrophic failure [129]. At early stages of use of hydrogen for maritime application, the bunkering with both CH 2 and LH 2 will presumably be shore-toship, while ship-to-ship bunkering with LH 2 will be required in the future to accommodate the refuelling of large amounts of hydrogen needed by sea vessels in a reasonable time [130]. Sea vessels transiting very long distances and serving a multitude of ports will require bunkering services in multiple locations whereas those covering relatively short distances and returning to the same port on a daily basis can operate effectively utilising the bunkering service at one single port. Similar to the aviation case, hydrogen could also be used at ports for powered equipment, such as cranes, cargo trolleys, reach stakers, forklifts, terminal tractors and harbour tugs, as investigated in the project H2Ports [131].Fig. 10 illustrates technologies envisaged for hydrogen production, distribution, bunkering, onboard storage and power conversion for seagoing marine vessels in the short term.

As such, hybrid hydrogen FCs and batteries as substitutes for diesel to power traction motors and auxiliaries in multiple-unit trains were investigated [138] and are seen as one of the most promising medium-and long-term strategies to further advance the decarbonisation of the UK rail system, in particular when electrification is too disruptive or expensive [139].

        <p>Using the current state-of-the-art technology, the power generated onboard hydrogen-fuelled trains will not be sufficient to enable (i) freight services and (ii) long-range services at high speed with high acceleration. The power management in a FC hybrid train is a primary factor for optimal operation, which varies with the amplitude and duration of power demand at different operational phases such as acceleration and coasting [140]. During acceleration, the power output of FCs is primarily used to operate the traction inverter and the auxiliary converter, which supply the power demand onboard the train. Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (Li-NMC) batteries can be used for acceleration boost. During short acceleration with limited power demand, Li-ion batteries are used to power the train. During coasting, FCs recharge Li-ion batteries and power the auxiliary converter. Once batteries are charged, the power output of FCs is reduced to power the auxiliary converter only.Using the current state-of-the-art technology, the power generated onboard hydrogen-fuelled trains will not be sufficient to enable (i) freight services and (ii) long-range services at high speed with high acceleration.

        <p>The first hydrogen-fuelled train prototype used hydrogen stored with metal hydrides to power a 17 kW FC integrated with a battery in a mining locomotive. MHs were chosen because of their low operating pressure, compact sizing and high efficiency [141]. Their heavy weight was considered a less important issue for railroad applications [142]. However, heat exchange during hydrogen absorption and desorption is a key engineering issue for rail application as MHs are poor in heat transfer and require (i) heat to release hydrogen and (ii) a heat exchange agent to store the heat released during hydrogen absorption. Currently, CH 2 stored at 350 bars in Type III or IV pressure vessels on the rooftop of the train is the principal storage design for railroad applications [138]. However, the loading gauge of UK trains is smaller due to the low height of the Victorian tunnels [136], resulting in a safety issue for the design for the UK market. To overcome this challenge, hydrogen could be stored in the motor coach (reducing the space available in the coach by 10e15% [136]) or underneath the train (as demonstrated by the HydroFLEX FC train [143]). A few studies were conducted in the UK on hydrogen-fuelled trains, such as the HydroFLEX FC train, which was developed as a joint venture between Birmingham University, Porterbrook and other manufacturing companies, such as Ballard Fuel Cell, by retrofitting a diesel Class 319 multipleunit train with hydrogen FC system and batteries [144]. Operational trials on the mainline railway were conducted in 2020. In the next phase, it is planned to demonstrate the realisation of a "bi-mode" train configuration, which will operate in both electrified and non-electrified routes using overhead electrical wires and hydrogen FCs, respectively [135]. By 2023, the technology will also be ready to convert currently operating trains to hydrogen-fuelled ones [76]. In addition, Arcola Energy developed in collaboration with the Consortium of Rail Industry Leaders a hydrogen train for the Scottish market by integrating the FC technology into the ScotRail Class 314 passenger train [145]. The train was demonstrated and tested at COP26 in November 2021. Recently, LH 2 fuelled trains were also investigated for locomotive application [137]. The investigated locomotive would be able to have a maximum speed of 150 km/h for a driving range of 1000 km and a reduction of 20% in refuelling times compared to CH 2 at 700 bar [146], although multiple research areas to address for the development of LH 2 fuelled locomotives were identified (optimal design of vessels and baffles for the reduction of boil-off gases, optimal location and method of refilling, materials and arrangement of the storage vessel, etc.) [137].The first hydrogen-fuelled train prototype used hydrogen stored with metal hydrides to power a 17 kW FC integrated with a battery in a mining locomotive.

        <p>Currently, commercial hydrogen models are available on the market but the limited demand. Research is required to increase performance, reduce capital and operating costs for the vehicles and the refilling together with the roll-out of the refuelling infrastructure. In particular, the development of large HRSs is considered key for the rollout of hydrogen vehicles due to the strong relationship identified between the availability of HRSs and the use of hydrogen fuel vehicles [16]. The intervention of the UK government is required to set deployment targets for HRSs, develop Standards and ensure a sufficient match between demand and supply and avoid under-utilisation of HRSs [149]. To increase the power density and the power response of FCs (compared to batteries and conventional ICEs), future hydrogen-fuelled requires a higher level of integration with ESSs [25]. Supercapacitors have the potential to improve the power of the FC vehicle due to their higher power density, efficiency and longevity compared to batteries. However, research is required to develop an advanced control system for the optimisation of power management [25]. For H 2 ICE vehicles, future research will investigate the fuel injection equipment and operating strategies [150]. The use of PFI injection systems in combination with batteries is considered the best option for H 2 ICE vehicles in the short-term, provided that research is conducted to modify existing engines, increase the power density and efficiency of the vehicle, detect and mitigate pre-ignition and knock and develop a better understanding of the kinetics of hydrogen mixed with another fuel (for dual fuel application) [150]. Future research in the medium-term will investigate the advancement of DI (spark ignition or high-pressure), which compared to PFI will present the benefits of higher power density, efficiency and transient response, no risk of back-fire and reduced modifications required to the engine, and on strategies to achieve optimised design, high performance and low NOx emissions (which could be achieved by injecting water in the combustion chamber) [150].Currently, commercial hydrogen models are available on the market but the limited demand.

        <p>Future research on hydrogen-fuelled trucks will focus on improvement in performance, durability, fuel efficiency and lifetime of hydrogen FCs. Improvements in hydrogen storage capacity are required to increase the driving range and the payload of the truck. As such, the use of strategies alternative for storage, such as sLH 2 and CcH 2 , will be realised in the medium-term. The definition of the optimal storage strategy and chassis design to allow more flexibility in the placement of the components onboard trucks is required. For H 2 ICEs, most of the current research is on light-duty vehicles. For the application of the technology in trucks, new design, control and calibration of H 2 ICEs are required to ensure more durability and high performance over conventional duty cycles for trucks [50]. If dual-fuel engines are adopted by hydrogenfuelled trucks in the interim, improvement in fuel injection timing, engine speed and emission control would make them more advantageous. HRSs for truck application would have to be designed to (i) ensure high flow, refuelling capacity and reliability and (ii) match hydrogen refuelling characteristics with truck application e.g. shorter hydrogen refuelling time and adjustment of the hydrogen refuelling to the driving range. In addition, the development of truck-specific refuelling Standards is required to account for (i) CH 2 700 bar compression, (ii) refuelling with LH 2 (for sLH 2 and CcH 2 onboard storage) and (iii) a further increase in temperature during compression because of the higher flow of hydrogen required by trucks. Hydrogen-fuelled buses present similar challenges to trucks. As such, an improvement in terms of durability, fuel efficiency and durability is required to increase the performance in the short to medium term and further ease the roll-out of hydrogen-fuelled buses. As opposed to trucks, buses have a start-stop driving duty cycle. As such, the realisation of the optimal integration of FC with the EES (battery or supercapacitor) should be identified and defined based on the bus application and driving range [151].

        <p>To develop the use of hydrogen in the aviation sector, power technologies (i.e., FCs, combustion engines and hybrid power systems) must be modified and advanced together with new aircraft designs, fuel storage and supply systems onboard. Integration of the necessary systems and tubing has not been implemented yet and must be realised in the medium term [152]. The use of hydrogen instead of kerosene for aviation will result in an increase in water vapour emissions. Research should investigate the effect of the increase in water vapour emissions due to the use of hydrogen-fuelled aircrafts on the formation of contrail and identify strategies for mitigation [153]. Alternative fuels, such as synthetic kerosenelike fuels, could also be used for aircrafts in the short-and medium-term. Using power-to-liquid technology, green hydrogen and CO or CO 2 captured are used to produce synthetic jet fuels that are similar to kerosene. The produced synthetic jet fuels are to be blended with traditional kerosene (up to 50%) and will be compatible with current infrastructure, aircraft and combustion engines without requiring any modification [154]. In comparison to hydrogen FCs and H 2 ICEs, this pathway offers lower climate impact i.e., 30e60% reduction (although there is no significant difference in NOx and water vapour emissions) [96]. The main barriers to sustainable aviation fuels from hydrogen are the current high cost and low scale production (which require slight modifications). Future production of sustainable aviation fuels from hydrogen could achieve 14.5e30.9 Mt per year, corresponding to 4e8% of global aviation use by 2035 [154]. Most countries are likely to start with short-haul flights, e.g. commuters, regional and short-range aircraft, whereas the aviation industry in some countries may take a longer timeframe to switch from kerosene to hydrogen. To achieve this, future research should look at developing airport infrastructure for the use of hydrogen and developing a technology for the refilling of aircrafts on runways [152]. The operation of hydrogen-fuelled aircrafts relies on facilities and ground support equipment in the airport, which necessitates infrastructure refurbishment. Significant steps towards the decarbonisation of the aviation industry can be obtained by using hydrogen for ground support equipment at airports, such as engine start units, cargo loaders, pushback trucks, baggage tractors, trolleys, etc. [155].

It is necessary to develop hydrogen-fuelled prime movers (i.e., ICEs, gas turbines, steam turbines and/or FCs) in combination with energy storage (batteries) and technologies that can harness renewable energy, such as Flettner rotors, which use as propulsion system in LH 2 tankers was theoretically investigated by Alkhaledi et al. [158]. In addition, waste heat recovery and emission control strategies with optimal space utilisation onboard vessels are required. In short to medium terms, onboard storage capacity should be extended to offer larger storage volumes over longer periods safely with minimal technical issues (e.g., sloshing effects [126], heat or hydrogen losses and impurities). Such research and development may include designing better storage tanks or reactors for onboard dehydrogenation using cheaper and novel materials with improved insulation and enhanced heat management. This is crucial to supply fuel required by international shipping, which usually transits long distances over days before arriving at the next port of call for unloading, loading and bunkering. The use of alternative fuels, such as NH 3 and LOHC, is seen as potentially feasible in the maritime industry in the medium-and long-term. Compared to fuels used for maritime applications, NH 3 has huge potential because of (i) its relatively high energy density, (ii) being sulphur-free (i.e. no need for aftertreatment), (iii) its potential of being used both as fuel and cargo and (iv) protocols are already in place for safety and handling of NH 3 as cargo [159]. However, significant advancements to increase the performance of ICEs running on NH 3 and limit NOx are required to stimulate its use as maritime fuel. The use of LOHCs in sea vessels has also been recently investigated and showed promising results for maritime application [160], provided that future research will (i) identify more efficient heat management during hydrogenation, (ii) realise integration between the waste heat of hightemperature FCs and hydrogen dehydrogenation process and (iii) develop new catalysts. Future research should also look at planning and developing port infrastructure to accommodate the use of hydrogen and facilitate ship bunkering services, considering space reallocation and realisation of new facilities required for handling, storing and releasing LH 2 and CH 2 in large quantities at ports. For bunkering, the use of cassettetype fuel systems, which store hydrogen in a container that is then loaded on the ship, could be realised in the future because it would allow reducing the refuelling time, although this strategy would be more suitable for small ships [126].

Current hydrogen-fuelled trains are not high-speed and cannot ensure a long driving range with a large payload if used for freight train application. Alternative strategies to increase the power density of stored hydrogen, such as LH 2 and CcH 2 , are, as such required to further advance the use of hydrogen in the rail environment, in particular for the development of hydrogen-fuelled locomotives or shunter units [137]. In addition, the development of bi-mode trains (running either using electrified lines or hydrogen) should be developed to increase the flexibility of operation [148].Future research for hydrogen-fuelled trains should focus on the optimal design, analysis and optimisation of the rail powertrain, including the definition of the optimal design for the UK market.

        <p>The current cost of hydrogen is one of the main challenges that limit the deployment of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles. To accommodate the large demand that will be required for the development of hydrogen-fuelled transportation, it is required to increase renewable hydrogen production via electrolysis. Centralised and on-site zero-carbon hydrogen production would start to flourish in the short term together with the growth in renewable energy production, where the most viable choices are solar and wind. For large-scale renewable production, improvement in energy efficiency and size is targeted for electrolysers by 2030. PEM electrolysers are expected to dominate commercial markets in the short term because of (i) their flexible start/stop procedure making them the most suitable option when powered by intermittent renewable sources [161] and (ii) their capacity to produce hydrogen at higher pressures, which reduces the extra Required modifications: combustion chambers, turbine blades, compressor air precooling, compressor cooling, hydrogen cooling, reheating and vaporisation (using heat exchangers for fuel preparation) and strategies to mitigate water vapour emission I/A New designs: novel combustors with heat exchangers to reduce NOx emissions, new power cycles and new airframe to ignite the hydrogen-air mixture more effectively I/A Hybrid power systems for aviation application: integrate new/modified combustion engines and/or FCs with batteries I/A Design of hydrogenfuelled aircrafts New or modified designs: (i) develop new structure and aerodynamic design, (ii) modify current configuration e.g. increase fuselage diameter and (iii) retrofit existing systems cost-effectively for hydrogen use I/A Hydrogen storage and supply onboard aircraft Enable large-scale storage: (i) design well-insulated storage tank, (ii) develop advanced materials e.g. lightweight composite and polymer with improved durability and easy to access for maintenance and (iii) locate fuel tanks strategically I/A Design hydrogen fuel supply and control systems that withstand a wide range of temperatures: (i) new fuel lines design, fitting and system, (ii) efficient operation of fuel pumps and heat exchangers, (iii) fuel warming before use and (iv) reliable, highly sensitive leak detection sensors I/A Airport infrastructure development Design and operate pipelines, trucks and storage tanks with excellent insulation to enable large-scale hydrogen supply and refuel the aircraft as well as ground support equipment (e.g. air conditioning unit, trolleys, baggage tractors, cargo loaders and stairs for passengers) G/I/A i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x x compression required at a later stage in the hydrogen refuelling supply chain. Solid oxide electrolysers, which do not require any precious metals, are still in development but their commercial applications are expected to grow, in which new electrolytes and electrodes would be developed in the short term to extend their lifespan and improve their thermal and operational stability. With a relatively simple configuration that can produce hydrogen at a purity level of 99%, membraneless electrolysers are worth exploring as an innovative means to reduce equipment cost. Other electrolyser cell concepts are currently in development, including elevated temperature (up to 623 K) proton-conducting polymer cells, i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y x x x ( x x x x ) x x x alkaline polymer water electrolysis cells and protonconducting ceramic cells [161]. Future research on electrolysers will focus on (i) the operation of the cell at higher pressure, (ii) the identification of the optimal electrocatalyst material (for PEM electrolysers) capable of providing high efficiency and being robust (most of the research has been conducted on noble metals, although more recently the use of non-noble metals, alloys and ceramics as catalyst material has been investigated), (iii) the identification of the optimal structure and efficiency for separators (diaphragms and membranes) and (iv) the stackability of the electrolysers [162].The current cost of hydrogen is one of the main challenges that limit the deployment of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles.

        <p>The development of a LH 2 supply chain capable of providing large volumes of hydrogen with reduced losses would also be required for the roll-out of large capacity HRSs. One of the biggest challenges is the realisation of large-scale LH 2 storages (between 20,000 and 100,000 m 3 ) as previous research investigated systems with capacities up to 6000 m 3 and the largest system currently operating has a capacity of 3200 m 3 [163]. Future research should focus on developing more efficient insulation systems that reduce boil-off losses and further investigating insulation strategies (i.e. vacuumed, fully or partially non-vacuumed) and materials [163]. Extensive laboratory research and pilot testing would be required before large-scale LH 2 could be achievable. To further increase the economic benefits of using hydrogen for transportation, FC cost must be reduced. This could be achieved, among others, by reducing stack dimensions and associated costs through i) enhanced rated working current, ii) thinner metal bipolar plate, iii) sheet metal stamping and iv) surface modification [164] and by the economics of scale [165]. The use of platinum group metals as catalysts is one of the major reasons for the current high cost of PEM FC. The reduction of platinum use and the development of platinum-free catalysts are considered fundamental research areas for PEM FCs [166]. Costs for storage should also be decreased by reducing the cost of storage tanks for CH 2 and energy consumption and the losses due to boil-off for LH 2 Furthermore, improvements in other FC technologies, such as solid oxide, direct methanol, etc., are required to further extend the decarbonisation of the transportation sector.The development of a LH 2 supply chain capable of providing large volumes of hydrogen with reduced losses would also be required for the roll-out of large capacity HRSs.

        <p>In terms of HRSs, synergies between transportation modes are required. To maximise them, progress should also be made in developing multipurpose hydrogen refuelling facilities and equipment that could enable efficient hydrogen supply and storage in bulk. The development of multimodal HRSs capable of supplying hydrogen to different transportation modes is fundamental for the roll-out of hydrogenfuelled transportation to increase demand, reduce dispensing cost, increase the economics of the HRS [28] and de-risk investments [149]. A demonstration multimodal hydrogen transportation hub will be realised in Tees Valley to evaluate the feasibility of this type of project and investigate the effect of transportation mode use, daily demand, electrolyser capacity, etc. [167].In terms of HRSs, synergies between transportation modes are required.

        <p>Safety should be considered with due care for each transportation mode and along the supply chain, s. The main safety concerns on hydrogen transportation are combustion, highpressure, electrical, crash and fire hazards [23,168], which require precautions at all stages from technology design and development to application. The development of regulations, such as national and international Standards, codes and policies, along the hydrogen supply chain and onboard the vehicle is also required to stimulate the commercialisation of hydrogen-fuelled transportation. Regarding the use along the supply chain, Standards should be developed about hydrogen characteristics (properties, safety, fuel specification, contaminant test and terminology), hydrogen production (safety/ general design, performance and installation), hydrogen storage and transport (safety/general design, storage tanks, embrittlement tests, piping and pipelines, venting, labelling, HRS design and operation, dispensing equipment and installation) and hydrogen detectors. Regarding the use onboard the vehicle, Standards are required for the system design and testing, safety, performance (efficiency, emissions and durability), terminology, hydrogen sensors, fuel system, recyclability, fuel tanks, refuelling dispensing connections and fuel specifications [169].
