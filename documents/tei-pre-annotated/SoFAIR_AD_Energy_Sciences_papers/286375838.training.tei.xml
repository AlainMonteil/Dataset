        <p>An application-based multi-objective optimization approach is presented to acquire the best operation condition for a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. The optimization is done for propulsion, power station, and portable applications, in which the recommended range for decision variables and importance level of the objective functions are taken into consideration for more accurate and practical results. In the multi-objective optimization, from each important aspect of the performance, i.e., technical, economic, dimensional, and environmental aspects, one objective is selected. The effect of threshold current density on both optimum decision variables and objective functions are also investigated to find the best value for that. The results reveal that increasing the maximum allowable current density leads to improvements in optimized values of all the objective functions. Moreover, the conducted sensitivity analyses determine that the threshold current density for the propulsion and power station applications is 1.3 A.cm-2 and for the portable application is 1.5 A.cm-2. Furthermore, it is found that values of the temperature, pressure and voltage in power station are not affected by optimization, whereas substantial decrease in both propulsion and portable applications brings more level of safety. Similarly, objective functions, i.e., efficiency, levelized cost, size, and greenhouse emission are averagely improved by 9.93, 16.95, 37.13, and 7.77%, respectively. The proposed procedure helps to design and manufacture the high-performance proton-exchange membrane fuel cells based on the employed application and users' preference.An application-based multi-objective optimization approach is presented to acquire the best operation condition for a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell.

        <p>The abstract and highlight sections set the tone of the paper and is often after reading the abstract and highlight sections when readers decide whether or not to read the paper at all. Besides this, the introduction is another major important part of the paper as it positions the paper's importance and why is there a need for such study. Another point to note is that similar titles have not only been published in JCLEPRO previously, but have also been published in other reputable journals such as SSRN Electronic Journal, Science of The Total Environment, Journal of Membrane Science, Fuel, Cell Reports, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics, et cetera. The authors have put forth a research problem that requires the world's attention because every entity has the social responsibility to promote clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, life on land, as well as promoting good health and well-being, as advocated in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals developed by the United Nations. However, the authors didn't mention the specific statistical analysis tool/technique employed to analyze the data and the significant findings in the 'Highlights' section. It will be more value-added if the authors documented the statistical analysis tool/technique employed to perform this analysis. Furthermore, when reading the abstract, the reviewer has been wondering what the research problem and significance of study are. Please reinforce your research problem and significance of study to make your case even stronger. In addition, the research framework/model and the graphical abstract seem to be missing from the manuscript. Please include the research framework/model and the graphical abstract to boost clarity and provide some incentives to attract reader's attention to read on. An eye-catching and attractive graphical abstract will enable the readers to grasp the overall picture at one glance (or in other words, provides a bird eye's view of the research study). In addition, it is important that the authors provide a thorough description of the underlying rationale (e.g., why?) this research should be studied. What are your research objectives? What is your significance of study? The motivation of this paper is not clearly laid out and is not convincing even though the reviewer could see the point from the authors, but the evidence that the authors try to lay out would need to be enhanced and clearly demonstrated. It would be great to see a stronger connection between your findings and the theme of the journal. How does this understanding help organizations and the industries to be more sustainable? How are your results/findings going to benefit the industries and societies at large? Much clearer and stronger justifications need to be put forth in order to convince the readers.The abstract and highlight sections set the tone of the paper and is often after reading the abstract and highlight sections when readers decide whether or not to read the paper at all. Besides this, the introduction is another major important part of the paper as it positions the paper's importance and why is there a need for such study. Another point to note is that similar titles have not only been published in JCLEPRO previously, but have also been published in other reputable journals such as SSRN Electronic Journal, Science of The Total Environment, Journal of Membrane Science, Fuel, Cell Reports, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics, et cetera. The authors have put forth a research problem that requires the world's attention because every entity has the social responsibility to promote clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, responsible consumption and production, life on land, as well as promoting good health and well-being, as advocated in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals developed by the United Nations. However, the authors didn't mention the specific statistical analysis tool/technique employed to analyze the data and the significant findings in the 'Highlights' section. It will be more value-added if the authors documented the statistical analysis tool/technique employed to perform this analysis. Furthermore, when reading the abstract, the reviewer has been wondering what the research problem and significance of study are. Please reinforce your research problem and significance of study to make your case even stronger. In addition, the research framework/model and the graphical abstract seem to be missing from the manuscript. Please include the research framework/model and the graphical abstract to boost clarity and provide some incentives to attract reader's attention to read on. An eye-catching and attractive graphical abstract will enable the readers to grasp the overall picture at one glance (or in other words, provides a bird eye's view of the research study). In addition, it is important that the authors provide a thorough description of the underlying rationale (e.g., why?) this research should be studied. What are your research objectives? What is your significance of study? The motivation of this paper is not clearly laid out and is not convincing even though the reviewer could see the point from the authors, but the evidence that the authors try to lay out would need to be enhanced and clearly demonstrated. It would be great to see a stronger connection between your findings and the theme of the journal. How does this understanding help organizations and the industries to be more sustainable? How are your results/findings going to benefit the industries and societies at large? Much clearer and stronger justifications need to be put forth in order to convince the readers.</p>

        <p>In order to find the best operating condition, the values of performance criteria are improved by adjusting the effective parameters (Marefati and Mehrpooya, 2019;Nagapurkar and Smith, 2019). However, in PEMFCs, there is a trade-off among performance criteria (Ayodele et al., 2018;Bukar and Tan, 2019). For example, increasing efficiency as a favorable change is accompanied by an increase in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is unfavorable (Becherif et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, performing single-objective optimizations like the study of Kanani et al. (Kanani et al., 2015) leads to partial results, and in order to acquire the best operating conditions, same as other energy systems (Sohani et al., 2019a;Sohani et al., 2018), multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach should be employed. A set of solutions, all of which has the potential of being the optimal answer, is obtained by running each MOO algorithm. The set is called Pareto optimal frontier (POF). Such optimization procedure has been implemented in many applications, from fuel cells (Sohani et al., 2019a), to thermal power plants (Sohani et al., 2017a), photovoltaic solar systems (Saedpanah et al., 2020), electrochemical systems (Pourmirzaagha et al., 2016), and management of micro grid (Jirdehi et al., 2017;Tabar et al., 2017). For instance, Sohrabi Tabar et al. (Tabar et al., 2017) solved the problem of micro grid management by the multi-objective optimization considering pollution and cost at the same time, and Ahmadi Jirdehi et al. (Jirdehi et al., 2017) found the best plan to run a micro grid system from both economic and environmental points of view by this approach.

Please kindly include the research model/framework to give readers a clear picture regarding what are the relevant variables and the proposed relationships between the variables at one glance. Besides this, there are several problems that minimize its overall contribution to the literature. What is your 'theory'? How has this paper contributed to existing theory? How has this paper advanced our understanding on the previous work on the existing theories? Perhaps the authors could consider the Resource-based view (RBV) theory or Natural Resource-based view (NRBV) theory. In addition, the authors did cite relevant work published by JCLEPRO, which is the most cited journal in GSCM and sustainability paradigms (de Oliveira et al., 2018).

        <p>As the existing theory, the optimum values of the operating parameters for a PEMFC is obtained from the recommended values or the multi-objective optimization approaches which have not considered all the performance criteria at the same time and have assumed the same priority level for the optimized objective functions. However, in this study, conducting the multiobjective optimization in which all the key factors including technical, economic, dimensional, and environmental aspects are taken into account is studied as the new theory. In addition, the new theory considers different levels of importance for the objective function based on the application. As a result, the proposed theory is a more practical and realistic one, and helps to design high-performance PEMFC more comprehensively and according to the users' preferences in different applications, in which the objective functions do not have the same level of priority.As the existing theory, the optimum values of the operating parameters for a PEMFC is obtained from the recommended values or the multi-objective optimization approaches which have not considered all the performance criteria at the same time and have assumed the same priority level for the optimized objective functions.

        <p>Additionally, although the impacts of the maximum allowable current density on the results of optimization has not been studied before the current study, in some references, it has been mentioned that this value has impacts on the optimum results, and the results of this study is found consistent with them. Moreover, in spite of the fact that all the key important performance aspects have not been considered at the same time in the multi-objective optimization, a huge improvement in the values of the objective functions is achieved compared to the base-case condition, and it is also in agreement with the points mentioned about the ability of the multiobjective optimization in the literature.Additionally, although the impacts of the maximum allowable current density on the results of optimization has not been studied before the current study, in some references, it has been mentioned that this value has impacts on the optimum results, and the results of this study is found consistent with them.

        <p>Working at a lower temperature and level of noise (Atyabi and Afshari, 2019), and producing electricity with greater power densities (Charoen et al., 2017) are taken into account as the most significant advantages of PEMFC in comparison to the other types. Moreover, this type of fuel cell is easy to handle and assemble (Haghighat Mamaghani et al., 2018;Shaygan et al., 2019).Working at a lower temperature and level of noise (Atyabi and Afshari, 2019), and producing electricity with greater power densities (Charoen et al., 2017) are taken into account as the most significant advantages of PEMFC in comparison to the other types. Moreover, this type of fuel cell is easy to handle and assemble (Haghighat Mamaghani et al., 2018;Shaygan et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>The mentioned advantages encourage a lot of researchers to conduct studies to enhance the performance of PEMFCs as a very promising technology as far as possible (Chatrattanawet et al., 2017;İnci and Türksoy, 2019), since its high efficiency can be higher than other kinds of renewable energy technologies, such as wind (Naderi et al., 2018;Naderi and Torabi, 2017). The enhancement has been done by changing the structure (Duclos et al., 2017), using novel materials (Mehrpooya et al., 2019) or finding the best operating condition (Marefati and Mehrpooya, 2019).The mentioned advantages encourage a lot of researchers to conduct studies to enhance the performance of PEMFCs as a very promising technology as far as possible (Chatrattanawet et al., 2017;İnci and Türksoy, 2019), since its high efficiency can be higher than other kinds of renewable energy technologies, such as wind (Naderi et al., 2018;Naderi and Torabi, 2017).

        <p>In order to find the best operating condition, the values of performance criteria are improved by adjusting the effective parameters (Marefati and Mehrpooya, 2019;Nagapurkar and Smith, 2019). However, in PEMFCs, there is a trade-off among performance criteria (Ayodele et al., 2018;Bukar and Tan, 2019). For example, increasing efficiency as a favorable change is accompanied by an increase in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is unfavorable (Becherif et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, performing single-objective optimizations like the study of Kanani et al. (Kanani et al., 2015) leads to partial results, and in order to acquire the best operating conditions, same as other energy systems (Sohani et al., 2019a;Sohani et al., 2018), multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach should be employed. A set of solutions, all of which has the potential of being the optimal answer, is obtained by running each MOO algorithm. The set is called Pareto optimal frontier (POF). Such optimization procedure has been implemented in many applications, from fuel cells (Sohani et al., 2019a), to thermal power plants (Sohani et al., 2017a), photovoltaic solar systems (Saedpanah et al., 2020), electrochemical systems (Pourmirzaagha et al., 2016), and management of micro grid (Jirdehi et al., 2017;Tabar et al., 2017). For instance, Sohrabi Tabar et al. (Tabar et al., 2017) solved the problem of micro grid management by the multi-objective optimization considering pollution and cost at the same time, and Ahmadi Jirdehi et al. (Jirdehi et al., 2017) found the best plan to run a micro grid system from both economic and environmental points of view by this approach. The studies (Tabar et al., 2019;Tabar et al., 2018) are some other examples of optimization in the field.In order to find the best operating condition, the values of performance criteria are improved by adjusting the effective parameters (Marefati and Mehrpooya, 2019;Nagapurkar and Smith, 2019).

        <p>The model which is used to run the PEMFC is based on a single domain formulation (Sohani et al., 2019a;Um et al., 2000) that couples electrochemical governing equations with equations governing the fluid flow in the gas channels, gas diffusion layers, catalyst layers and electrolyte membrane. The positive aspect of this approach is that it solves the whole cell as a sandwich in a way that there is no need to generate new equations as boundary conditions (Esfahanian and Torabi, 2006;Esfahanian et al., 2008). It can be used for simulation of batteries as well (Torabi and Aliakbar, 2012;Torabi and Esfahanian, 2011). This model is utilized to run the simulation under different operating conditions as stated in (Sohani et al., 2019a), then stepwise regression method is used to extract an equation describing the performance of the FC. Although numerical methods have been used to solve the governing equations (Hosseinzadeh et al., 2019a;Seyedmohammad Mousavisani, 2019), analytical methods may be a good choice for future research (Hosseinzadeh et al., 2019b;Sohani et al., 2017b). In addition, all the necessary information about the data analysis of the employed models were given in the previous study of the authors conducted on PEMFC (Sohani et al., 2019a), and in order not to make paper too 78 lengthy, it is referred for more details.The model which is used to run the PEMFC is based on a single domain formulation (Sohani et al., 2019a;Um et al., 2000) that couples electrochemical governing equations with equations governing the fluid flow in the gas channels, gas diffusion layers, catalyst layers and electrolyte membrane.

The recommended range of decision variables for different applications is given in Table (3).

        <p>The optimization problem has been completely defined in the previous Stepstep. Therefore, in at this stepstage, MOO is employed to find a set of solutions which that have has the potential of being the final answer, called Pareto optimal frontier (POF). Non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA-II), which was completely introduced and employed in the previous publications of the authors like (Sohani and Sayyaadi, 2017;Sohani et al., 2019b), is employed for this purpose. NSGA-II is one of the most widely-used methods to find POF. It should be also noted that 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> software was used to conduct the NSGA-II and obtain POF.

        <p>As it was previously stated, running a multi-objective algorithm leads to obtaining a set of answers, called POF. It means that employing the MOO algorithm individually does not give the final solution individually, and the final answerit must be selected by using a decision making method.

        <p>In the used combined method, initially, the relative level of importance for each criterion (objective function) in the selection of the final solution is obtained by pairwise comparison of criteria to each other. It is done by forming a matrix, called the matrix of pairwise comparisons (MPC) (Sohani et al., 2017a). The comparisons are done by the suggested scale of Saaty, which is presented in Table (5). After performing the pairwise comparisons by conducting the mathematical matrix operations discussed in details in (Boukhari et al., 2018), the relative level of importance of each criterion in the selection of the final answer is determined. The output for the i st criterion is the weight of w i , which is a numerical value between 0 and 1, and shows the relative importance degree of that criterion compared to the other criteria. Having determined the w i values for the criteria involved in the decision making (which are objective functions), the closeness index (Cl) for each point on POF is calculated from Eqs. ( 9) to (12), and the answer with the highest Cl is selected as the final optimal solution (Karami and Sayyaadi, 2015): It should be also mentioned that, as it is clear from definition, in case the relative level of importance of criteria in comparison to each other becomes the same, the introduced combined method reduces to the ordinary TOPSIS (Sohani et al., 2016). The 
            <rs type="software">codes</rs> developed in 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> software was employed to run the decision making method and select the final answer by the introduced method.

The PEMFC considered in this study, is the one which has been investigated in the previous studies of the authors like (Sohani et al., 2019a). In addition to the specifications, the priority level of the objective functions for the case study based on experts' judgments, which is necessary to obtain the final solution by the combination of AHP and TOPSIS, are also introduced. It should be noted that the priority level is totally dependent on the experts' points of view, and it might be different for other cases.Application of the proposed approach is shown by employing it for a PEMFC.

The important point for economic data is they should be up to date (Sohani and Sayyaadi, 2018), and for this reason, the data indicated in Table ( 7) is compared to the online prices found in the references like (Fuel Cell Store, 2019). The comparison shows that there is a good agreement between the data and online information. As it is seen, all the used methods and employed equations were adopted from the published literature and they have been utilized in several researches in different fields. Therefore, each of them, and consequently, the combination of them are accurate and reliable. Moreover, considering the fact that only economic indicators such as discount rate are not the same in the two different countries, only the levelized cost will be different and studying in another country does not have any impacts on the values of the other performance criteria in the same condition for the effective parameters. For the levelized cost, however, it should be also noted that in spite of having different values in two different countries, the variation trend is almost similar.Table (7) gives the data required to calculate LCOE as the economic objective function.

        <p>As discussed previously, in order to select the final solution among the points on POF by using the combined AHP and TOPSIS, the relative importance of performance criteria (objective functions) must be determined.

        <p>Based on the obtained results, it is found that the optimization algorithm prefers to select almost equal humidity values in anode and cathode parts in all of the applications and values of . As a result, the trends of variation of for both decision variables, which are presented in values of for the propulsion usage are less than the two other ones, but in higher values (more than 1.5 A.cm -2 ), the values optimum humidity content for all the applications approaches to a constant value. From the beginning to the end of the range for propulsion, power station, and portable applications almost 13.5, 4.0, and 4.5% changes are observed, respectively. For these two decision variables, the optimum values increase since, increasing the humidity content in both cathode and anode parts means a faster reaction rate, which is accompanied by a better PEMFC performance.Based on the obtained results, it is found that the optimization algorithm prefers to select almost equal humidity values in anode and cathode parts in all of the applications and values of .

        <p>In contrast to all of the previously studied decision variables, the optimum voltage remains constant in the whole investigated range as it is illustrated in Fig. (1g). The optimized values of voltage for propulsion, power station, and portable applications are 0.78, 0.88, and 0.73 V, respectively.

        <p>The mentioned advantages encourage a lot of researchers to conduct studies to enhance the 36 performance of PEMFCs as a promising technology as far as possible (Chatrattanawet et al.,37 2017; İnci and Türksoy, 2019), since its high efficiency can be higher than other kinds of 38 renewable energy technologies, such as wind (Naderi et al., 2018;Naderi and Torabi, 2017). The 39 enhancement has been done by changing the structure (Duclos et al., 2017), using novel 40 materials (Mehrpooya et al., 2019) or finding the best operating condition (Marefati and 41 Mehrpooya, 2019).The mentioned advantages encourage a lot of researchers to conduct studies to enhance the 36 performance of PEMFCs as a promising technology as far as possible (Chatrattanawet et al.,37 2017; İnci and Türksoy, 2019), since its high efficiency can be higher than other kinds of 38 renewable energy technologies, such as wind (Naderi et al., 2018;Naderi and Torabi, 2017).

        <p>In order to find the best operating condition, the values of performance criteria are improved by 43 adjusting the effective parameters (Marefati and Mehrpooya, 2019;Nagapurkar and Smith, 44 2019). However, in PEMFCs, there is a trade-off among performance criteria (Ayodele et al.,45 2018; Bukar and Tan, 2019). For example, increasing efficiency as a favorable change is 46 accompanied by an increase in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is unfavorable 47 (Becherif et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, performing single-objective optimizations 48 like the study of Kanani et al. (Kanani et al., 2015) leads to partial results, and in order to acquire 49 the best operating conditions, same as other energy systems (Sohani et al., 2019a;Sohani et al., 50 2018), multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach should be employed.

        <p>The model which is used to run the PEMFC is based on a single domain formulation (Sohani et 62 al., 2019a;Um et al., 2000) that couples electrochemical governing equations with equations 63 governing the fluid flow in the gas channels, gas diffusion layers, catalyst layers and electrolyte 64 membrane. The positive aspect of this approach is that it solves the whole cell as a sandwich in a 65 way that there is no need to generate new equations as boundary conditions (Esfahanian and 66 Torabi, 2006;Esfahanian et al., 2008). It can be used for simulation of batteries as well (Torabi 67 and Aliakbar, 2012; Torabi and Esfahanian, 2011).
