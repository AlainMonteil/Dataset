        <p>CA is an enzyme with spread occurrence in nature, found in several living organismsfrom microbes and algae to vertebrates, as mammals (Sharma et al., 2020). CA plays a fundamental role in diverse biological-related mechanisms such as CO 2 transport, pH homeostasis, cell respiration and photosynthesis (Mondal et al., 2016). The demonstration that the enzyme successfully catalyzed reversible CO 2 hydration reaction to form bicarbonate, also under typical conditions of industrial flue gases, expanded the possibilities of capturing carbon from industrial processes, from a biological route (Bond et al., 2000). This approach, also denominated as biomimetic CO 2 sequestration, has been targeted in studies of CO 2 capture, displaying so far good results -CA is a very fast enzyme whose turnover number can be as high as 10 4 -10 7 s -1 (Sharma et al., 2020). In this way, CA utilization can be a smart strategy to achieve targets of carbon neutrality, as for example, by enabling net-zero emissions energy systems due to the increase in efficiency of carbon capture (IEA, 2020).CA is an enzyme with spread occurrence in nature, found in several living organismsfrom microbes and algae to vertebrates, as mammals (Sharma et al., 2020).

        <p>2.1. Structure, families, and occurrence CA (EC 4.2.1.1) constitutes a subclass of enzymes reported to exist in all life kingdoms (Supuran, 2016). CAs active structure most commonly contains a metal ion arranged in the center of tetrahedral geometry, bounded to three amino acids, and a hydrophilic part containing a water molecule or a hydroxide ion (Yadav et al., 2014) (Ozensoy Guler et al., 2016). Other geometries' configurations can exist under octahedral and bipyramidal forms (J. K. Kim et al., 2020). CAs are metalloenzymes, and the Zn is the most prevalent metal found in them. Nonetheless, other elements, such as Cd and Fe, were reported to occur in CAs of specific organisms (Tripp et al., 2004) (Akocak and Supuran, 2019) (Nocentini and Supuran, 2019).2.1.

        <p>Up to date, there are several types of CAs known which are classified into eight genetically distinct families: α-, β-, γ-, δ-, ζ-η-, θ-and ι- (Akocak and Supuran, 2019). α-CAs are the most numerous type in nature, being the first discovered exemplar in the early '30s, in the blood of humans (Meldrum and Roughton, 1933). Their oligomeric arrangement differs and can be found as monomer, dimer, and tetramer as quaternary structures (Cuesta-Seijo et al., 2011) (Supuran and Capasso, 2017). The α-CA occurrence in mammals is very well-documented, with 15 human isoforms so far identified, being intensively studied as drugs target research and diagnosis/therapeutic applications (Alterio et al., 2012).Up to date, there are several types of CAs known which are classified into eight genetically distinct families: α-, β-, γ-, δ-, ζ-η-, θ-and ι- (Akocak and Supuran, 2019). α-CAs are the most numerous type in nature, being the first discovered exemplar in the early '30s, in the blood of humans (Meldrum and Roughton, 1933).

        <p>Other species, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and algae have α-CAs as well, in which they regulate vital functions related to respiration, acid-basis homeostasis and the pH regulation, CO 2 transport, sexual development, and photosynthesis mechanism, respectively (Elleuche and Pöggeler, 2010).Other species, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and algae have α-CAs as well, in which they regulate vital functions related to respiration, acid-basis homeostasis and the pH regulation, CO 2 transport, sexual development, and photosynthesis mechanism, respectively (Elleuche and Pöggeler, 2010).</p>
        <p>The second group of most documented CA belongs to the β-CA type. They are present in microorganisms like bacteria and archaea, fungi, some types of high plants, and invertebrates. Typical quaternary structures so far discovered in β-CAs are dimer, tetramer, hexamer, and octamer (Kimber, 2000) (Murray and McKenna, 2019) (Urbanski et al., 2020). Plants and algae usually have CA in their chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively, being believed they participate in the mechanisms of CO 2 fixation in plants (Mitra et al., 2004). Also, some fungal species possess this type of CA, with exemplars from Candida sp, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sordara macrospara, and Aspergillus fumigatus (Elleuche and Pöggeler, 2010) (Kim et al., 2020), where CA is a coadjuvant in mechanism related to pathogenicity. In bacteria, functions to pH regulation, by transporting bicarbonate (HCO - 3 ) into the cell membrane, and virulence stimulation were also reported (Abuaita and Withey, 2009). The γ-CAs belong to a distinct family of CA presenting a left-handed parallel b-helix domain. Their presence occurs in bacteria, archaea, and some photosynthetic organisms, and so far, their quaternary structure revealed to be trimers (Ferraroni, 2019). Interestingly, evidence show that those enzymes might be one of the most ancient types among CAs (Smith et al., 1999). Ion transport and carbon fixation are some of the roles of CA in archaea and cyanobacteria. The other CA families, δ-, ζ-η-, θ-and ι-, occurs in nature in a scarcer way. For marine diatoms, both δ-and ζ-CAs are found to have be indispensable for enabling the process of carbon concentration (Capasso, 2019) (Langella et al., 2019); η-CA has only been identified in species of Plasmodium (Prete et al., 2014b). Τhe θ-and ι-types can occur in marine diatom and bacteria, and θ-types in algae. θ-Cas, which contain Zn in their active site, are also reported for photosynthetic efficiency and growth in diatoms and (D'Ambrosio et al., 2019). For ι-types, besides the limited number of representatives and the poor report about their existence and properties, it is known that they can present their structure as dimers and can have their active site with Mn, instead of a Zn molecule (Prete et al., 2020).The second group of most documented CA belongs to the β-CA type.

        <p>The catalytic mechanism of CA involving in CO 2 hydration/dehydration is known, however, CA also shows catalytic activity in other hydro catalytic reactions, such as the hydration of CS 2 and COS, hydrolysis of esters and cyanamide hydration to urea (Tanc et al., 2015). In nature, the reversible CO 2 hydration reaction occurs spontaneously, however, at limited rates. As a principle, CA acts in accelerating this reversible reaction towards the formation of a bicarbonate ion, as shown in eq. (.1). In this way, the CA could bring benefits in CCUS, by enhancing the efficiency and yield of CO 2 absorption. Compared to the non-catalyzed reaction, in which the catalytic turnover is in the order of magnitude of 0.15 s -1 , CA can potentially boost this reaction up to 1 billion fasterreported k cat /K m values ca be up to 10 8 s -1 (Effendi and Son Ng, 2019).The catalytic mechanism of CA involving in CO 2 hydration/dehydration is known, however, CA also shows catalytic activity in other hydro catalytic reactions, such as the hydration of CS 2 and COS, hydrolysis of esters and cyanamide hydration to urea (Tanc et al., 2015).

        <p>For explaining the steps towards CO 2 hydration, a reaction mechanism was proposed (Supuran, 2007) (Kanth et al., 2013). The α-CAs, for example, have a metal-water molecule bond (EM-H 2 O), which when ionized eq. ( .2) (forming EMOH -), presents a strong nucleophilic character. When a molecule of CO 2 approaches the enzyme structure, it is powerfully attracted by this part and linked to the hydroxyl group, conforming afterwards a bicarbonate ion to the metallic ion (eq .3). Further, the bicarbonate ion is released to the solution after being displaced from the active site by a water molecule (eq. (.4)); in the mass transfer limiting phase, thus, the rate-determining step of the reaction (Nocentini and Supuran, 2019), the metal-hydroxyl bond is regenerated: a proton transfer (H + ) from the water molecule will take place, driven by either the amino-acid chains present in the CA structure, or the buffers in the environment solution (eq .5), finally being bonded to the buffered media (eq. (.6)) completing the catalytic cycle CA (Lindskog, 1997). The Fig. 2 illustrates the mechanism of CO 2 hydration reaction catalyzed by CA.For explaining the steps towards CO 2 hydration, a reaction mechanism was proposed (Supuran, 2007) (Kanth et al., 2013).

        <p>On the one hand, CA emerges to be a promising alternative to improve carbon fixation rate. due to its high catalytic efficiency; on the other hand, enzymes have a sensitive nature and might be susceptible to environment conditions such as high temperature, very acidic or very alkaline pH values leading to its deactivation. Besides, some metals and ions can inhibit the CA, affecting the enzyme activity in a temporary or permanent way.On the one hand, CA emerges to be a promising alternative to improve carbon fixation rate. due to its high catalytic efficiency; on the other hand, enzymes have a sensitive nature and might be susceptible to environment conditions such as high temperature, very acidic or very alkaline pH values leading to its deactivation.

        <p>When applied to industrial processes of CO 2 capture, thermostability and chemical resistance are crucial features to be achieved. Typically, the exhausted gases employed in the absorption column can reach up to 60 • C and the stripping column above 100 • C, with common solvents utilized to have strong alkaline character (Mumford et al., 2015). In this way, enhancement of enzyme properties targeting the obtention of more versatile and adaptable to adverse conditions of reaction are very desired. The utilization of protein engineering techniques such as directed evolution, rational design methods, and enzyme immobilization stands out for enabling more stable CAs, impacting the lifetime and resulting in lower operating costs.When applied to industrial processes of CO 2 capture, thermostability and chemical resistance are crucial features to be achieved.

        <p>Directed evolution (DE) has emerged as one of the strategies employed to improve the stability of enzymes, from the simulation of natural evolution paths in lab environment (Yang et al., 2015). This technique is widely employed specially when particulars of the target structure are not well-known (Xu et al., 2019). For a succeeded DE experiment, high genetic diversity and appropriate selection or screening methods are necessary (Xiao et al., 2015). As a first step, for the creation of a diversified genetic library, strategies such as random Fig. 2. The catalytic mechanism of CA. Reaction occurs following the order i) CA active site is deprotonated (H + ), ii) molecule of CO 2 approaches the active site, iii) CO 2 is coordinated into CA active site, iv) A molecule of bicarbonate is released by the substitution for a molecule of water followed by a deprotonation to restore the catalyst to the initial step. Am: amino acid, Zn +2 : zinc ion. mutagenesis, EpCR and chemical mutagenesis, can be employed. Initially, expression of variants is performed, followed by screening to reveal which variants reached the desired properties intended by the mutation. In the last step, the genes identified are amplified (Sofia and Nogueira, 2013).

        <p>Novel variants of a CA from Thermovibrio ammonificans (TaCA), with a potential to be applied in CO 2 capture, were produced also applying directed evolution. Modifications were performed in amino-acids located in the N-terminal region and resulted in variants with improved half-life compared to the original type. The variants were exposed to conditions suitable for CO 2 capture -at high temperature (&gt;70 • C) and pH value 10. Among the constructed mutants, the variant S8R/G9P/E22P showed a 3-fold higher half-life in 1.45 M K 2 CO 3 solution, at 85 • C and great stability when exposed to a solution of 2 M MDEA. Finally, in order to evaluate the TaCA stability under cyclic operation, an experiment simulating the operational conditions of an absorption/desorption cycle under the following approach was performed. A variant of TaCA, identified as SEQ ID N o 7, was dissolved in a K 2 CO 3 solution loaded with CO 2, and repeatedly pumped in two different reservoirs, with two distinct temperatures (40 and 77 • C). After 20 days, the enzyme was capable of retaining up to 80% of its initial activity, showing that the DE strategy increased the enzyme stability in at high cyclic conditions and strong alkaline media, clearly evidencing its potential applicability under industrial conditions (Voyer et al., 2019).Novel variants of a CA from Thermovibrio ammonificans (TaCA), with a potential to be applied in CO 2 capture, were produced also applying directed evolution.

        <p>Of course, the contribution of DE to enhance CA properties is meritorious and have still a great potential of application in the field given the possibility of optimizing enzyme characteristics and creating novel catalysts (Zeymer and Hilvert, 2018). However, some drawbacks of this technique should be noticed, particularly related to low efficiency and the need of large genetic library to increase the chance of successful resultswhich can lead to significant efforts during the screening phase, such as additional time and higher consumption of materials (Yang et al., 2015) (Zeymer and Hilvert, 2018).Of course, the contribution of DE to enhance CA properties is meritorious and have still a great potential of application in the field given the possibility of optimizing enzyme characteristics and creating novel catalysts (Zeymer and Hilvert, 2018).

        <p>As an alternative, utilization of rational protein design constitutes a powerful tool in the field of protein engineering. Its main features, however, relies on performing targeted adjustments, utilizing nonrandom molecule alterations. As a principle, the characteristics of the protein structure should be investigated and understood, and afterwards, modifications in the molecule can be proposed at specific sites (site-directed mutagenesis). Therefore, for a successful new enzyme design a deep knowledge about the structure and the enzyme mechanism of action is crucial (Steiner and Schwab, 2012), otherwise the alterations proposed might negatively impact on specificity and activity. So far, rational design happens via two ways: computer simulation or protein conformation (Dinmukhamed et al., 2021). The first is quite used in the research of improving CAs. With help of molecular dynamics and other computational tools, properties such as the increase of thermal stability could be verified, through the inclusion of intermolecular bonds in the CA molecule, such as disulfide and salt bonds and the inclusion of hydrophobic residues at the molecule surface (Jo et al., 2016) (Parra--Cruz et al., 2018).As an alternative, utilization of rational protein design constitutes a powerful tool in the field of protein engineering. Its main features, however, relies on performing targeted adjustments, utilizing nonrandom molecule alterations. As a principle, the characteristics of the protein structure should be investigated and understood, and afterwards, modifications in the molecule can be proposed at specific sites (site-directed mutagenesis).

        <p>In another work (Bharatiy et al., 2016), a highly thermostable CA variant from a mesophilic form of α-CA from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (ngCA) was designed. With the help of molecular dynamics, variables with an impact on stability were analyzed, such as salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, solvent-accessible area, and unfolding pathway. From this analysis, a mutant was designed from the insertion of three amino acid residues in the structure of the molecule. For evaluating the effect of the mutation on thermostability, the melting temperature was determined, and an enhancement of ΔT m of 21 K was found. The modified ngCA contained more average number of hydrogen bonds and five additional salt bridges and presented more rigid structure. Furthermore, the activity of mutant CA showed evidence of being higher when compared to the wild type, from the calculations of pKa. As a conclusion, the new designed CA presented a more stable, a more active enzyme and with improved resistance to temperature, possibly due to new bonds created through the introduction of other amino acids into the enzyme, reflecting its potential to be utilized in high temperature conditions. Also looking for a more thermostable form of CA, different variants of α-CAs were investigated to produce an ultra-thermostable form to be applied in carbon sequestration. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, TaCA was identified as the most stable enzyme among the studied CAs, indicated by the presence of the most rigid structure. For the design of the ultra-thermostable enzyme, alterations were targeted in amino acids which were determined with more flexibility and higher root mean square fluctuation (RMSF). Mutations were done by exploring two different approaches: the first, with an in silico mutation to form charged or small non-polar residues and a second, through the addition of a disulfide bonds to stabilize the most flexible zones. Also, five of eight designed mutants showed more rigid structures than the wild type at 400 K, reflecting their capability to retain activity at higher temperatures (Parra-Cruz et al., 2018). Further, a complementary experimental study was performed to verify the improved thermostability of the studied TaCA mutants via site-directed mutagenesis. The variants exhibited similar CO 2 hydration activities to the wild type, ranging from 0.6 to 1.04-fold. During the assessment of the enzyme thermostability at 90 • C, a CA variant, N140G, presented no loss of activity, meanwhile, the initial activity of wild type was decreased by 70%. Furthermore, an increase in 2.6-fold of half-life was observed for this same variant when incubated at 60 • C. To complement, all designed variants were subjected to an experimental procedure, where an absorption-desorption cycle was mimicked; the results showed that three variants (mutations C67G, N140G and T175P) were able to maintain their initial activity after complete cycles. Finally, the enzymatic activity was assessed at 95 • C and an increase up to 53-fold for the mutant N140G and up to 23-fold for the other TaCA four mutants was constated when compared to 25 • C. During the same assay, the wild-type presented, though, an increase up to 14-fold testifying all the designed mutants could successfully have their thermostability enhanced (Parra-Cruz et al., 2020). In the above studies, higher thermostability was reached by increasing the rigidity of CAs' structure, such as through the introduction of new salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, evidencing the correlation between high-temperature tolerance and less flexible residues. The utilization of rational design to produce ultra-thermostable CAs is valuable since it is possible to identify, by molecular simulations, the most susceptible regions and target them to be stabilized more assertively. Such technique can be of great interest for circulating CA through CO absorption-desorption cycles as well, of which the latter requires high temperatures. Also, the improvement in thermostability of mesophilic variants, such as NgCA, is highly desirable to allow the enzyme to work in moderate higher ranges of operationsuitable to the conditions of CO 2 absorption which usually occurs at temperatures up to 40 • C. It is important, although, to highlight that more rigidity in CAs structure could bring some undesired effects, affecting enzyme activity, due to limited access to the active site or lower substrate affinity caused by the introduction of new residue(s) in the molecule.In another work (Bharatiy et al., 2016), a highly thermostable CA variant from a mesophilic form of α-CA from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (ngCA) was designed.

        <p>With an approach other than thermostability enhancement, a halotolerant mutant from bovine carbonic anhydrase II (BCA-II) was created through a series of mutations by altering existing amino acid residues to an acidic form of them. From rational design, target residues were selected according to their localization in the CA structure and level of intramolecular engagement with neighboring residuesbeing given the preference for the ones located on the protein chain surface and with weaker interactions, to reduce the possibilities of causing molecule instability. In total, 18 residues were chosen for mutation, which took place in 3 stagesresulting in 4 different mutants (M1-M4), with amino-acid substitutions varying from 6 to 18. A mutant (M4) showed enhanced tolerance at high salt concentration, with increasing unfolding temperatures the more concentrated was the media (NaCl, NaSO 4 -up to 3 and 2 M, respectively) while its wild-type faced an opposite effect in the unfolding temperature. In addition, positive correlation between salt concentration and activity were also observed; the ratio between apparent catalytic activity of a mutant and the wild type was about 5-fold, when assessed in a NaSO 4 (1.5 M) solution, and about 1.4-fold for NaCl (3 M). The results proved the engineered CA was capable to exhibit halotolerant characteristics while it was demonstrated that halotolerance can be generated in an enzyme solely by modifying surface residues (Warden et al., 2015). For application involving the utilization of non-conventional CO 2 capture sequestrant agents, such solid residues from combustion or mine tailings, the CA variant may prove a suitable candidate.With an approach other than thermostability enhancement, a halotolerant mutant from bovine carbonic anhydrase II (BCA-II) was created through a series of mutations by altering existing amino acid residues to an acidic form of them.

        <p>Other works, also aiming for thermostability, were able to show positive results towards the increase of half-life, where utilizing sitedirected mutagenesis, a mutant from ngCA (N63C/P145C) reached 8fold higher than the wild-type at 70 • C (Jo et al., 2016). Utilizing the same technique, a variant of hCA II (L204K) had its thermostability improved and was able to keep 100% of retention at 45 • C compared to its wild type, which at the same temperature was completely deactivated (Wu et al., 2020). Employing BCA II (Fisher et-al 2012), a mutant (TS4) designed through site-directed mutagenesis presented both thermostability and kinetics enhanced; melting temperature was improved by about 6 • C and the maximal proton transfer enhanced 6-fold compared to its wild-type (see Table 1).Other works, also aiming for thermostability, were able to show positive results towards the increase of half-life, where utilizing sitedirected mutagenesis, a mutant from ngCA (N63C/P145C) reached 8fold higher than the wild-type at 70 • C (Jo et al., 2016).

        <p>The utilization of both DE and computational tools is possible, which can be referred as combinatorial approach or semi-rational design. With an objective of obtaining a more efficient CO 2 capture with MDEA in an absorption power plant, a variant of a β-CA from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (DvCA) was engineered to obtain a more suitable mutant to work under the harsh process conditions, such as the high temperature in the stripping unit and high reactive character of the solvent. The construction of libraries was performed utilizing saturation mutagenesis and statistical analysis to optimize the efficiency of screening; over 27,000 mutants were screened during 9 rounds of evolution, at high temperatures and MDEA at concentration 3.0-4.2 M. As result, the chosen mutant to operate in the experiment (DvCA 8.0), showed an improvement of 10.000-fold of half-life when compared to its wild form and presented 40% of remaining activity when stored during a period of 14 weeks in MDEA 4.2 M at 50 • C (Alvizo et al., 2014). Results proved a representative enhancement of wild CA properties, showing that the approach can be a strong tool to bring higher stability and to optimize enzyme use through recycling in consecutive absorption-desorption cycles.

        <p>More resistant and adapted CAs are indeed essential for enabling enzymes able to resist scrubbing and regeneration processes at industrial scale and conditions. However, as high costs are still involved in CA production, it is reasonable to direct efforts towards enzyme recovery and recycling to decrease operational costs in CA-assisted systems (Molina-Fernández and Luis, 2021). The small dimensions of the enzyme, as small as 5 × 4 × 4 nm 3 in some α-types (Lindskog, 1997), makes its recovery hard and inefficient if executed through simple unit operations, such as filtration and/or centrifugation. Enzyme immobilization strategies have been widely employed to bring a longer operational lifetime for CA when compared to its free form. Also, the immobilization process is reported to create an additional protective effect in the enzyme (Ren et al., 2021). Consequently, besides reutilization, the enhancement of properties as thermostability, retention of activity and tolerance to hazardous chemicals, such as amines, sulfur, and nitrate compounds, can also be accomplished.More resistant and adapted CAs are indeed essential for enabling enzymes able to resist scrubbing and regeneration processes at industrial scale and conditions.

        <p>Five classic methods are used to immobilize enzymes, namely adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, encapsulation, and crosslinking enzyme aggregates (Effendi and Son Ng, 2019). The choice of a specific immobilization method varies accordingly to the conditions in which the reaction takes place, such as type of solvent, reactor type, temperature, and how the chosen method might compromise secondary characteristics such as activity and kinetics.Five classic methods are used to immobilize enzymes, namely adsorption, covalent binding, entrapment, encapsulation, and crosslinking enzyme aggregates (Effendi and Son Ng, 2019).

        <p>In adsorption, the attachment of enzyme to the matrix happens via weak type of interactions, such as van der Waals force, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces. This method is very simple, and variables such as time of incubation, enzyme loading, pH, temperature, and agitation speed are generally studied to optimize its activity. Studies employing adsorption to immobilize BCA showed particular good results in term of specific residual activity (up to 98.8%) after immobilization and for the improvement of catalyst reusability, with remaining activity of 84% and 96% after 20 and 30 cycles of pNPA assays, respectively (Vinoba et al 2011) (Vinoba et al., 2012b). Besides, BCA was immobilized by adsorption in a metal organic framework (MOF) (Ren et al., 2018). The residual activity reached after immobilization was 75% at 60 • C, and 40% of initial activity was kept while the free form was completely deactivated. As an advantage, adsorption can offer a high loading capacity of CA per surface unit and does not necessarily require complex preparation. The weak/mild nature of chemical interactions between enzyme and carrier, however, can lead to the detachment of enzyme from the matrix, especially when subjected to high ionic media occasioning the leaching and loss of CA activity. Selection of materials which have more robust interactions with the CA, and pore size similar to the CA molecule size can improve catalyst reusability ref.In adsorption, the attachment of enzyme to the matrix happens via weak type of interactions, such as van der Waals force, hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces.

        <p>For that, further steps to bring enhanced stability to the enzyme, such as activation of functional groups or post-modification are desired (Wu et al., 2020), once they can provide more stability by creating further interactions between CA-support, such as ionic and covalent bonds. For entrapment, the enzyme is kept physically enclosed inside the matrix (Effendi and Son Ng, 2019). This method is relatively simple and can be performed with biobased polymeric materials origin such as sodium alginate and chitosan (Zhu et al., 2016a) (Oviya et al., 2012) (Yadav et al., 2012) or matrixes such as silica-based and other polymeric materials (Hsieh et al., 2021). Properties such as improved thermostability were reported, when after the process of immobilization in a bioinspired silica matrix, BCA was able to maintain its initial activity when incubated at 50 • C, while its free form was completely deactivated. Also here, 100% of the initial activity was retained after the immobilization process (Forsyth et al., 2013). In another evaluation, CA from Bacillus subtilis was entrapped in chitosan-alginate polyelectrolyte hydrogel and showed almost 94% of residual activity after immobilization. In addition, the immobilized could preserve 45% of initial activity when tested at pH 11, while the free form was totally inactivated (Oviya et al., 2012). Among the advantages of entrapment are the promptitude of the method and the utilization of inexpensive materials with low toxicity as support. The process of entrapment can offer extra protection once it (partially) coats the enzyme. When exposed to reactive solvents, CA lifetime can be prolonged due to the protection of the enzyme in the matrix and limited exposure to harsh reaction environment (temperature, alkali). Thus, in many cases higher thermostability is observed when compared to the free form. Main drawbacks can be the lower apparent activity as the support may restrict the substrate access to CAs' active sites and enzyme leaching due to the delicate nature of some biopolymeric matrices and their degradation over time. A further step after the entrapment, such as cross linking, could further improve the stability of the polymer network. Other popular technique of immobilizing enzymes, the covalent attachment (or bonding), consists of creating a strong link between enzyme and support through covalent bonds, normally via side chains of amino or epoxy groups (Effendi and Son Ng, 2019). For the CA, the attachment normally occurs via an amino acid group (lysine) as a nucleophile which can attack, i.e. an epoxide or aldehyde group present in the support (Sheldon et al., 2005). Covalent bonding is a very used method, as it promotes a stronger bonding to the enzyme to the matrix, when compared to other methods such as adsorption. Examples utilizing BCA, showed that the covalently attached CA presented high stability and improved capacity of recycling, keeping more than 87% and 75% of initial activity after 20 and 40 cycles, respectively (Vinoba et al., 2011) (Fei et al., 2016). The strong bonds which CA forms with the support in this method contributes in improving the catalyst reutilization capability, resistance to harsher environments, which is of great industrial interest. As drawbacks, the method can restrict the structure of the enzyme, decreasing the accessibility of active sites, culminating in loss of activity (Ren et al., 2021).For that, further steps to bring enhanced stability to the enzyme, such as activation of functional groups or post-modification are desired (Wu et al., 2020), once they can provide more stability by creating further interactions between CA-support, such as ionic and covalent bonds.

        <p>Like entrapment, encapsulation has as basis the confining of the enzyme in a network structure. The method is reported to immobilize the enzyme with high efficiency, and results in high stability and specific activity (Wu et al., 2020b). Also, improved reusability with this method was proven to work, showing with residual activities up 90% after 10 cycles of successive pNPA assays when tested with a CA from Hahella chejuensis (Min et al., 2016). Besides, encapsulation is the easiest technique of immobilization when compared to other technologies and offers a micro-environment for the enzyme, helping it to maintain the CA structure.Like entrapment, encapsulation has as basis the confining of the enzyme in a network structure.

        <p>With a different approach, CLEA (cross linked enzyme aggregates) is a method which does not need a support to immobilize the CA. This technique consists of a first step with enzyme precipitation by employing saturated salts (e.g. ammonium sulfate) or solvents, followed by crosslinking to avoid the enzyme to dissolve afterwards (Peirce et al., 2015). During cross-linking, lysine residues at the enzyme surface react with an aldehyde group from the cross-linker (typically glutaraldehyde) in a polymeric reaction, resulting in complex network where the CAs are covalently linked (Sheldon et al., 2005). Activity after immobilization with BCA were reported to as high as 84% (Peirce et al., 2015). Also, stability after repeated cycles was keptwith 95% of initial activity after performing 10 cycles. Once CLEA does not require a matrix for the immobilization process, costs related to immobilization process can be much lower. However, recover is still one of the main challenges when utilizing these techniques once the utilization of filters or other simple operations are not efficient to recycle the catalyst. Aiming to overcome this obstacle, utilization of magnetic nanoparticles with BCA in CLEA was tested, facilitating its recovery. After 5 cycles of CO 2 absorption in a glass reactor and utilizing an alkaline buffer, the magnetic CLEA was able to keep 95% of its initial activity (Peirce et al., 2017). The formation of covalent bonds during CLEA preparation, makes this method a good candidate to enhance CA recyclability similar to covalent bonding. The lack of a matrix during CLEA preparation leads to cost reduction when compared to other methods, while the use of glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent is a highly economic choice.With a different approach, CLEA (cross linked enzyme aggregates) is a method which does not need a support to immobilize the CA.

After 5 cycles of CO 2 absorption in a glass reactor and utilizing an alkaline buffer, the magnetic CLEA was able to keep 95% of its initial activity (Peirce et al., 2017). The formation of covalent bonds during CLEA preparation, makes this method a good candidate to enhance CA recyclability similar to covalent bonding. The lack of a matrix during CLEA preparation leads to cost reduction when compared to other methods, while the use of glutaraldehyde as cross-linking agent is a highly economic choice.</p>
        <p>Besides, utilization of combined immobilization methods is used to improve the susceptibility to leakage and deactivation of the enzyme, by creating a more robust CA attachment to the support. In other study, BCA was adsorbed in magnetic mesocellular siliceous foam (Woo et al., 2015). After, chitosan was adsorbed as CA-support, and then cross-linked via glutaraldehyde (GA) treatment. Utilizing pNPA assays, the immobilized CA had an improvement in half-life in 353-fold to the free form and kept almost all initial activity after 30 cycles of CO 2 absorption with further mineralization, which provides an indication that the cross-linking step presents positive effects on enzyme reusability. The material showed to be effective to prevent CA leaching, confirmed through a test where the immobilized enzyme was agitated for 85 days and still preserved the initial activity. In other example, experiments conducted with BCA and poly (acrylic acid-co-acrylamide)/hydrotalcite hydrogel, showed that the specific activity of the immobilized catalyst could reach near to 90%. The enzyme was embedded in the porous of the activated (with N-hydroxysuccinimide) hydrogel, forming covalent attachments with this matrix as well. The resistance to higher temperatures was verified as well, and after a period of 60 min, the immobilized form could keep 65% of residual activity and free form, instead, lost all the initial activity (Zhang et al., 2009), showing that the method could improve the thermostability of the enzyme. As drawback, the combined methods can demand more steps during preparation increasing complexity.Besides, utilization of combined immobilization methods is used to improve the susceptibility to leakage and deactivation of the enzyme, by creating a more robust CA attachment to the support.

        <p>All methods of immobilization usually show some improvement in thermostability. The enzyme enclosure, such as entrapment and encapsulation methods, could preserve the CA structure from deformation once it restrains the enzyme mobility. However, it can limit the mass transfer diffusion of substrate. CA attached onto supports through weak nature interactions, such as physical adsorption, might not be recommendable under harsh environment conditions. Also, it is advisable to understand if the CA-matrix bonds can be affected in the presence of the chosen solvent. More stable catalysts, such as CLEAs and covalent bonded forms, are more likely to resist in solutions where there is no competition of the solvent with the amino acids that bond the CA to the matrix, like in buffered and salt solutions. On the other hand, they increase rigidity that may affect enzyme activity. Finally, the investigation of combined immobilized methods is highly recommendable since they help to overcome issues of catalyst stability and activity loss. It is worth to mention that most studies focus on immobilization are based on standard analytical assays, thus further evaluations of the immobilized forms in actual CO 2 absorption conditions is needed to comprehend their performance. An overview of different immobilization methods and their combinations applied to CA are presented in Table 3.All methods of immobilization usually show some improvement in thermostability.

        <p>CAs may differ immensely in properties such as halo-and salts tolerance, thermostability, and pH resistance -all relevant for CO 2 absorption applications. Evaluating and identifying variants that combine such characteristics is a crucial step in enzyme selection. BCA, an α-type is a very well-known and commercially available enzyme, works with optimal temperature at 35 • C and pH operation range between 7.0 and 7.5 (Sharma and Bhattacharya, 2010). It can be quick inactivated at temperatures above 60 • C (Luca et al., 2013) which limits its application to absorption and desorption cycles, whose operation ranges range easily reach 40-60 • C and 70-80 • C, respectively (Ye and Lu, 2014). This scenario of challenges motivated numerous researchers committed to identify novel CAs with improved thermal and/or chemical resistance.CAs may differ immensely in properties such as halo-and salts tolerance, thermostability, and pH resistance -all relevant for CO 2 absorption applications.

        <p>Among thermostable CAs, CA isolated from the liver of a camel kept 82% and 72% of its residual activity when exposed to temperatures of and 60 • C, respectively (Chafik et al., 2020). A combination of indigenous CAs isolated from Pseudomonas fragi (PCA), Micrococcus luteus 2 (MTCA), and Micrococcus lylae (MLCA) showed an increased operating temperature of up to 10 • C as well as 3.42-fold higher CO sequestration when compared to commercial BCA (Sharma and Bhattacharya, 2010). An α-CA from Lactobacillus delbrueckii (LdCA) presented a half-life of 370 and 177 h when exposed to temperatures of and 50 • C, respectively (Li et al., 2015) and the α-type CA from Bacillus halodurans (BhCA) demonstrated to be extremely stable at 40 • C. However, a half-life of 65 min was observed after being incubated at 50 • C (Faridi and Satyanarayana, 2016). At 40 • C, both BhCA and LdCA presented high-temperature stability. However, at 50 • C LdCA showed a half-life almost 163-fold higher than BhCA, evidencing that BhCA may be an interesting choice for application at higher temperatures. In complement to that, CAs from extrethermophilic bacteria, such as S. yellowstonense YO3AOP1 (SyCA) and Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense (SazCA) presented robust stability at very high temperatures, maintaining almost 100% of their activities at temperature ranges between 80 and 100 • C for about 180 min (Luca et al., 2013) (Capasso et al., 2012). The discovery of such CAs, which are not only stable at high temperatures but also present high activity in a broad range of temperature was remarkable. In this way, the existence of highly stable CAs working at high temperatures (above 80 • C) corroborates the potential of CA utilization not only in industrial stripping processes, but also in CO 2 regeneration cycles.Among thermostable CAs, CA isolated from the liver of a camel kept 82% and 72% of its residual activity when exposed to temperatures of and 60 • C, respectively (Chafik et al., 2020).

        <p>Temperature resistance is a critical factor to enable more competitive biomimetic absorption processes. Nonetheless, the enzyme performance in alkaline conditions is a topic of equal importance. BhCA, LdCA, and an α-CA from Aeribacillus pallidus (ApCA), respectively, showed noticeable stability at pH values up to 11, without significant loss of their initial activity (Faridi and Satyanarayana, 2016) (Li et al., 2015) (Bose and Satyanarayana, 2016). Furthermore, a recombinant CA obtained from B. halodurans TSLV1 (rBhCA) was able to keep 66% of initial activity after 24 h of incubation at pH 11.0. Also, when incubated for 2 h at pH 12.0, the enzyme kept 100% of its initial activity (Faridi et al., 2017).

        <p>Gas scrubbing, utilizing carbonate solutions, has existed for decades, and this concept has been exploited and adapted for CO 2 capture as well. More recently, the utilization of carbonate-bicarbonate systems to CO 2 absorption has become a possibility in post-combustion absorption due to the lower heat of reaction and environmental impact. However, those systems have slow kinetics when uncatalyzed and can easily reach pH values greater than 10 when working at high salt concentrations (Zhang et al., 2013) (Ye and Lu, 2014). High alkali-stable CAs, therefore, can be understood to be a suitable option to be applied in such conditionspromoting the improvement of reaction rate, without losing their activity so promptly. Diverse studies utilizing alkaline media conditions assessing the CA effect in carbonate solutions were conducted to understand the kinetics mechanism behind this absorption as well as the conditions to promote higher CO 2 enhancement capture. In a system consisting of a wetted wall column with 30 wt% K 2 CO 3 solution (and 0.04 of loading) and a thermostable CA (NZCA, from Novozymes) showed that 70% of its catalytic efficiency (initially at 5.3 × 10 8 M -1 s 1 ) remained after 8 h at pH 10.6 to pH 10.8 and 323 K. In addition, when CA was added at a concentration of 5.2 μM, a 10-fold increase in CO 2 absorption to the uncatalyzed baseline was observed (Hu et al., 2017), demonstrating the high enzyme stability and no loss of CA specificity after the incubation In another evaluation, the catalytic constant rate of a commercial α-CA from Novozymes in 20 wt% carbonate-bicarbonate solution was estimated at different temperatures. The experiment took place in a stirred tank reactor working in batch mode at 298-323 K, pH 10.1-11.0, and 0.2 g/l CA. The k cat /K m at the studied conditions were estimated, and ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 . This timid variation evidenced the temperature did not play a significant influence in improving enzyme kinetics at such conditions. Also, a decrease of the enhancement CO 2 absorption factor from 4.6 to 2.4 was observed (compared to the uncatalyzed reaction) when higher temperatures were utilized (313-333 K). The addition of the enzyme reduced substantially the reaction's activation energy, however, higher temperatures influence the kinetics. Also, the solubilization of CO 2 in water is affected negatively at the higher temperatures, limiting the available amount of this component to the reaction (Ye and Lu, 2014). Zhang et al. (2013) evaluated the k cat /K m of BCA in a carbonate-bicarbonate solution utilizing a stirred tank reactor, pressurized with CO 2, and temperature up to 298 K, and found a 5.97 × 10 6 M -1 s -1 . Comparing to other evaluations at similar conditions, the k cat /K m obtained in those studies were still superior to the BCA, ranging between 1.2 and 20-fold (Russo et al., 2013) (Zhang and Lu, 2015) (Ye and Lu, 2014). The catalytic efficiency becomes even higher once some types of CA, such as the CA produced from Novozymes, which have proved to have their catalytic activity at higher temperatures than the mammalian CAs, reaching more than 97.2-fold when operating at 323 K and under high alkali conditions (Hu et al., 2017). Luca et al. (2013) assessed the kinetic parameters of the CA from SazCA, SyCA, hCA II, and the CA from Helicobacter pylori (hpCA), in a stopped-flow experiment, at pH 7.5 and room temperature. The results revealed the SazCA to be one of the fastest CA so far known, showing a k cat /K m 3.5 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 and 3.2 to 23-fold higher catalytic efficiency than its counterparts. However, the experiments were conducted in a stopped-flow experiment, at pH 7.5 and room temperature, not employing highly alkaline solutionswhich makes the comparison with other studies not straight forward. Utilizing K 2 CO 3 solutions, the value of k cat /K m for NovoCA (Novozymes) varied 0.91-1.5 × 10 4 kg m -3 s -1 , when assessed in a 2 M K 2 CO 3 solution with carbonate to bicarbonate conversion (CTB) varying from 20 to 40% for temperatures between 298 and 313 K (Peirce et al., 2018a). Those results are similar to what was observed by Gladis et al. (2017a), where the kinetic parameters of NovoCA in potassium carbonate solutions (5-20 wt%) were assessed at 298-328 K, and showed values of k cat /K m ranging from 2.8 × 10 3 -2.1 × 10 4 kg m -3 s -1 . Other studies assessing kinetic parameters under varied conditions of pH, temperature, and different types of CA, showed values of k cat /K m ranging 3.27 × 10 3 -1.2 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 (Peirce et al., 2018b) (Chafik et al., 2020) (Effendi et al., 2021).

        <p>Favorable kinetics can imply more efficient and fast reactions; however, the enzyme reutilization is vital to make CA a competitive biocatalystpossible through immobilization techniques. However, during the process of immobilization, the kinetics can be negatively affected. The CA's active sites might become less accessible due to the immobilization process, so it is crucial to assess the impact of the kinetic parameters as well. In Vinoba et al. (2012a), for example, BCA was immobilized via covalent bonding onto a support of (octa (aminophenyl)silses-quioxane)-functionalized Fe 3 O 4 /SiO 2 nanoparticles. From pNPA assays, the k cat /K m was found to be 734 M -1 s -1 , corresponding to 89.5% of the free form. From the results, the immobilization process did not substantially affect the catalytic efficiency. Nevertheless, the kinetics assessment in multiple absorption cycles to verify a loss in CA substrate affinity or eventual leaching could be valuable. Employing two different carbonate-bicarbonate solutions, one at 0.5 M Na 2 CO 3 -NaHCO 3 , and the second at 10 wt% K 2 CO 3 with CTB conversion 0-40%, were evaluated in terms of their kinetics. The tests were made at 298 and 313 K and a thermostable CA (NovoCA, Novozymes) with concentration varying from 0.2⋅10 -2 and 1.5•10 -2 kgCA m -3 of liquid volume. As result, the catalytic efficiency k cat /K m reached the highest values of 1.22 × 10 3 m 3 kg -1 s -1 , for the K 2 CO 3 solution at 298 K and CTB 0%, and 1.46 × 10 3 m 3 kg -1 s -1 for the sodium carbonates solution at 313 K. The experiments happened in a stirred cell, and the CA was immobilized by covalent bonding in a matrix of magnetic nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 -facilitating its recovery after reaction. Furthermore, k cat /K m presented positive relation with temperature increase. The authors tested the stability of immobilized CA in carbonate solutions to verify the strength of the covalent attachment, and they reported enzyme leaching at high CA loads during catalyst preparation due to the high salt concentration environment in which causes detachment of the CA from the support. The overall results, though, showed the immobilized form could be utilized if applied under specified operation conditions (Peirce et al., 2018b). The immobilization process decreased the catalytic efficiency to 12-49% of the free form. Also, it was demonstrated that the bicarbonate ion had a negative effect on it. Despite that the enzyme tolerated high alkali salt conditions, kinetics was impaired. In a study also utilizing a high-alkali solution as solvent, a matrix composed of silica nanoparticles was chosen to minimize intra-particle effects of diffusion-phenomenon typically observed in porous materials. The kinetics parameters, using 3 different matrix particle sizes, a 0.1 M K 2 CO 3 -KHCO 3 (pH:10.5) solution, an enzyme loading varying from 45.1 to 54.9 mg/g of matrix -were estimated and revealed good results of catalytic efficiencywith values varying from 0.216-0.281 × 10 7 M -1 s -1 and immobilization factor between 0.36 and 0.47. Also, the immobilized form kept 80% of residual activity after incubation at 50 • C and pH 10.5 for 30 days, while its free form lost 40% of initial activity (Zhang et al., 2013). Comparing the kinetic parameters values to the previous work, where CA was immobilized in porous controlled pore glass, the immobilization factor (residual activity of immobilized enzyme over the free counterpart) has approximately doubledconfirming that the use of nanoparticles in fact improved catalytic efficiency (Zhang et al., 2011). Besides, the utilization of non-porous supports can decrease the high intra-particle diffusion resistance normally observed in porous matrixes, leading to higher activities to this form. Although kinetics play an important role, other relevant factors are important in enzyme selection for industrial applications, such as the suitability to the process, potential for reusability and robustness when exposed to harsh environments. Over the years, the idea of employing the biomimetic route as an alternative over traditional CO 2 absorption paths has gained strength due to the simplicity of its mechanism, to evoke of the natural phenomenon of CO 2 fixation under the form of bicarbonate/carbonates. This concept integrates CA to accelerate the mechanism (Bond et al., 2000). Its eco-friendly appeal when compared to traditional absorption methods, by employing aqueous solutions instead of amine-based solvents and its lower energy requirements (Qi et al., 2016) makes the biomimetic approach to be an appealing route to be followed in the research field of CCUS.Favorable kinetics can imply more efficient and fast reactions; however, the enzyme reutilization is vital to make CA a competitive biocatalystpossible through immobilization techniques.

The immobilization process decreased the catalytic efficiency to 12-49% of the free form. Also, it was demonstrated that the bicarbonate ion had a negative effect on it. Despite that the enzyme tolerated high alkali salt conditions, kinetics was impaired. In a study also utilizing a high-alkali solution as solvent, a matrix composed of silica nanoparticles was chosen to minimize intra-particle effects of diffusion-phenomenon typically observed in porous materials. The kinetics parameters, using 3 different matrix particle sizes, a 0.1 M K 2 CO 3 -KHCO 3 (pH:10.5) solution, an enzyme loading varying from 45.1 to 54.9 mg/g of matrix -were estimated and revealed good results of catalytic efficiencywith values varying from 0.216-0.281 × 10 7 M -1 s -1 and immobilization factor between 0.36 and 0.47. Also, the immobilized form kept 80% of residual activity after incubation at 50 • C and pH 10.5 for 30 days, while its free form lost 40% of initial activity (Zhang et al., 2013). Comparing the kinetic parameters values to the previous work, where CA was immobilized in porous controlled pore glass, the immobilization factor (residual activity of immobilized enzyme over the free counterpart) has approximately doubledconfirming that the use of nanoparticles in fact improved catalytic efficiency (Zhang et al., 2011). Besides, the utilization of non-porous supports can decrease the high intra-particle diffusion resistance normally observed in porous matrixes, leading to higher activities to this form. Although kinetics play an important role, other relevant factors are important in enzyme selection for industrial applications, such as the suitability to the process, potential for reusability and robustness when exposed to harsh environments. Over the years, the idea of employing the biomimetic route as an alternative over traditional CO 2 absorption paths has gained strength due to the simplicity of its mechanism, to evoke of the natural phenomenon of CO 2 fixation under the form of bicarbonate/carbonates. This concept integrates CA to accelerate the mechanism (Bond et al., 2000). Its eco-friendly appeal when compared to traditional absorption methods, by employing aqueous solutions instead of amine-based solvents and its lower energy requirements (Qi et al., 2016) makes the biomimetic approach to be an appealing route to be followed in the research field of CCUS.</p>

        <p>Experiments to assess the biomimetic CO 2 absorption have been investigated by exploring both the CO 2 capture alone and CO 2 capture coupled with storage.

        <p>In a study conducted in a stirred tank reactor and utilizing 20 wt% K 2 CO 3 solutions as solvent, BCA varying from 0 to 600 mg/l and temperatures from 298 to 303 K reached up to 12.8-fold CO 2 absorption than the uncatalyzed system. The experiments showed that higher concentrations of BCA led to high absorption rates. However, for BCA concentrations above 300 mg/l, the absorption rates did not present a proportional enhancement. Also, the temperature played an important role on the reaction, being the CO 2 sequestration inversely proportional to the temperature when employed the same concentration of the enzyme -the catalytic enhancement factor dropped from 8.8 to 3.4 when tested with 300 mg/l of the CA, 20% of carbonate to bicarbonate conversion and temperatures of 298 and 323 K, respectively (Lu et al., 2011). Differently, by using a wetted wall column, an enhancement of 10-fold in the first order rate coefficient was reached when compared to reaction without the catalyzer. This system operated for 8 h at 323 K, with NZCA concentration of 0.22 g/l and used as solvent a 30 wt% K 2 CO 3 -KHCO 3 solution (Hu et al., 2017). Both cases evidenced the potential of CA in boosting CO 2 capture more than 10-fold to the uncatalyzed forms. In the first study, higher loads of CA did not affect the absorption, meaning that substrate availability was a limiting factor. Also, higher temperatures limited the CO 2 absorption, as a result of the decreased gas solubility.In a study conducted in a stirred tank reactor and utilizing 20 wt% K 2 CO 3 solutions as solvent, BCA varying from 0 to 600 mg/l and temperatures from 298 to 303 K reached up to 12.8-fold CO 2 absorption than the uncatalyzed system.

The system worked with the stripping unit at temperature of 348 K and pressure of 0.35 barand had the energy required for the regeneration process reduced. The evaluation tested a CA from Novozymes with concentrations varying from 1 to 4 g/l and a plateau was reached after concentrations above 2.5 g/l. The maximum CO 2 capture efficiency (for the absorption) reached during the experiments was 89% (Qi et al., 2016). The authors highlighted the possibility of increase CO 2 desorption driving force by increasing the temperature at strip unit, once the utilized CA in the round of experiments had limited tolerance to temperature. This case illustrates a good example of opportunity for the employment of an ultra-thermo stable CA variant, such as SyCA or SazCA, to promote regeneration efficiency without changing the settled process. The development of a less energy-intensive configuration adds competitivity to the technology when compared to traditional absorption processes.In another interesting assessment of an integrated regeneration system composed of a scrubber and stripping unit, an improvement up to 4.6-fold of CO 2 capture efficiency in the absorption column, and 4 times less energy in its desorption unit were attained.

        <p>In Faridi et al. (2017), BCA was tested for precipitation of bicarbonate onto CaCO 3 , in a reaction with total volume of 75 ml and CA concentration 2 mg/l. CA dissolved in 15 ml of a 1 M Tris buffer with 1.5 wt% CaCl 2⋅ 2H 2 O was added to 60 ml of CO 2 saturate solution. The onset of CaCO 3 precipitation for the catalyzed reaction was 32 s, much faster than the control, which required 139 s. Also, the mass of CaCO 3 obtained during the precipitation revealed a 5-fold increase when compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Employing a similar procedure, Bose and Satyanarayana (2016) performed mineralization experiments using ApCA at room temperature and Tris buffer. The improvement in the onset of CaCO 3 precipitation was 3.6-fold when compared to uncatalyzed reaction. The same experiment was performed utilizing BCA and results showed the ApCA was 1.6-fold faster than the mammalian type, evidencing the superiority of the CA from bacterial origin. Sharma and Bhattacharya (2010), for example, performed CO 2 absorption in a bench scale reactor (20 ml) with a mix of PCA, MTCA and MLCA (at 4.1 mg/l) and utilized BCA as baseline for comparison. The precipitate was recovered and characterized, and from the solid weighted it was possible to determine improvement of 3.6-fold CO 2 sequestration efficiency compared to BCA. Also, Chafik et al.

        <p>When CA was coupled with the mineralization step, a decrease in the onset of CaCO 3 precipitation happened. Furthermore, CA variants tested at similar conditions differed in CO 2 capture, and consequently, precipitate formation. Studies with a comprehensive assessment, including temperature effect, substrate concentration, and CA load, are scarce in the field, representing an opportunity for future research works. Such good prospects, though, can face some limitationsespecially in terms of enzyme production cost and the inability to be reused at multiples cycles. Because of that, efforts aiming to prolong the lifetime and catalytic activity are still one of the main keys to enable CA to be competitive.When CA was coupled with the mineralization step, a decrease in the onset of CaCO 3 precipitation happened.

        <p>Comparing BCA covalently immobilized on Fe 3 O 4 microspheres, the free form presented higher absorption rate than the immobilized oneabout 25% greater, however the reusability studies, performed through assays, showed that the immobilized enzyme was capable of keep almost 60% of its initial activity after 10 cycles, potentially increasing its overall CO 2 capture efficiency over the free form. Since the utilized matrix had magnetic properties, the biocatalyst recovery was facilitated in the end of each cycle (Lv et al., 2015). Still regarding BCA, features such as kinetics parameters, were evaluated at similar conditions of pH, temperature, and assay, but utilizing different immobilization techniques. In the first case, BCA was covalently immobilized onto a magnetic chitosan/SiO 2 /Fe 2 O 3 composite support, and the CO 2 absorption rate was quantified by measuring the pH drop over time. The experiments were conducted in a glass reactor with deionized water and bubbled with CO 2 . A decrease in about 3 of pH value was observed in the immobilized form with the CA, but the support without the enzyme presented about 1.5 in pH value drop. Addition of CA evidenced the faster formation of bicarbonate and H + ions and showed a k cat /K m 303.1 M -1 s -1 (Sahoo et al., 2012). For the second approach, an in-situ encapsulation in microporous zeolite imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) to immobilize BCA resulted in higher activities of immobilized over the free formabout 18% more active. Also, the evaluation of the kinetic parameters revealed a k cat /K m of 471.8. M -1 s -1 . The increased activity was confirmed through a CO 2 absorption reaction of a solution pre-saturated with CO 2 in Tris HCl buffer at 25 • C, with posterior mineralization. In total, 34.3 mg and 29.5 mg of CaCO 3 were obtained for immobilized and free enzyme, respectively, in a reaction with volume of 30 ml and CA concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Furthermore, after 10 repeated cycles of CaCO 3 precipitation, the immobilized enzyme could retain more than 60% of the initial catalytic activity of the free enzyme, revealing the notable potential for this type of catalyst in CO 2 capture (Asadi et al., 2019). Both immobilization approaches kept similar CO 2 sequestration capacity after ten cycles. Nevertheless, they differed in initial residual activity. From the bottle-around-a-ship encapsulation approach, where the in situ encapsulation occurs within the framework during it synthesis, the ZIF-8 network encages the enzyme, helps to keep the integrity, still allowing a good transfer of substrate to the CA active sites. That can explain the superior performance of this latter to the covalent bonding, which can rigidify the CA structure, decreasing the enzyme activity. Using a recombinant variant of BhCA covalently immobilized onto iron magnetic nanoparticles, the CO 2 capture to form CaCO 3 was evaluated. The reaction occurred using a CO 2 saturated solution, at 310 K, with enzyme concentration of 2 mg/l and 1 M Tris buffer The onset of CaCO 3 was 10 sonly 7.1% of the uncatalyzed reaction and the amount of CaCO 3 formed from the CO 2 sequestration was 140 mg and 138 mg for free and immobilized forms, respectively. The utilization of a nanoparticles support can reduce the CA unfolding and improve its performance, which can explain the similar apparent activity for free and immobilized form.

        <p>Other examples, in which CO 2 absorption to mineralization was also performed, showed an enhancement ranging from 5 to 11-fold CaCO 3 precipitation (Oviya et al., 2013) (Faridi et al., 2017). For the first evaluation, CA from E. coli was entrapped using a chitosan-alginate polyelectrolyte complex and tested in a saturate CO 2 solution with CA at an approximate concentration of 4.3 mg/ml of immobilized enzyme per volume of solution. The reaction with the free enzyme showed 5.5% more carbonate precipitation than the immobilized formdemonstrating that the immobilization process did not affect too much the activity of the enzyme when compared to its free form. CA addition improved CO 2 capture 11-fold. When assessing the recyclability performance of the catalyst, the sequestration capacity was 53% of the initial after eight cycles of absorption (Oviya et al., 2013). The presence of bicarbonates from CO 2 absorption can destabilize the structure of some matrices, such as in chitosan and calcium alginate, probably by an occurring ion exchange between the matrix and the solution. In the case of alginate, the transfer of calcium ions into the solution, could lead to matrix collapse and enzyme release. To mitigate the problem, adding soluble alkali metal salts in the media reaction, such as calcium chloride, could provide a source of metallic ions for the bicarbonate to form CaCO 3 , maintaining the alginate's structure. High concentrations of CaCO 3 , though, could hinder the action of biocatalyst once it can accumulate on its bead surface, creating a barrier to the substrate reaching the CA.Other examples, in which CO 2 absorption to mineralization was also performed, showed an enhancement ranging from 5 to 11-fold CaCO 3 precipitation (Oviya et al., 2013) (Faridi et al., 2017).

        <p>The other study, where BhCA was immobilized through covalent bonding on a matrix of iron magnetic nanoparticles, indicated that the capability of precipitate CaCO 3 was almost the same for both free and immobilized formapproximately 920 mg of CaCO 3 per mg of enzyme. The reaction happened at CA concentration of 2 mg/l in a saturate CO 2 solution with buffer Tris-HCl added to calcium chloride. In this set of experiments, the catalyst could successfully keep, after 22 repeated cycles, about 50% of its initial activity. Remarkably, the time spent to initiate the precipitation of the carbonate dropped from 132 s to 10 s, for the uncatalyzed and CA immobilized reactions, respectively, and increased the CaCO 3 precipitation in 4.9-fold (Faridi et al., 2017). In both immobilization methods, the initial sequestration capacity was like the free form, near 100%. The covalently bonded form, though, presented superior recyclabilityabout 2.8-fold than the entrapped CA to reach about 50% of initial sequestration capacity, showing the covalent attachment was more robust to keep the enzyme properties and to prevent leaching, as sometimes observed in some entrapped forms. The precipitated CaCO 3 per mg of the enzyme was 3.8 higher for the BhCA, even with a lower enzyme concentration than the CA from E. coli, inferring BhCA a more suitable choice for CO 2 capture followed by mineralization. Also, it is valuable to highlight the presence of ions that could have an inhibitory effect on some enzymes, such as calcium and carbonates, which can affect enzyme activity.The other study, where BhCA was immobilized through covalent bonding on a matrix of iron magnetic nanoparticles, indicated that the capability of precipitate CaCO 3 was almost the same for both free and immobilized formapproximately 920 mg of CaCO 3 per mg of enzyme.

        <p>Besides various examples of immobilized CA applied to biomimetic route, examples addressing this approach at pilot-scale are still few. However, some good examples exist where immobilized CA was tested in experimental set-ups with conditions more realistic to the ones occurred in commercial absorption processes. In a three-phase trickled bed reactor, the biomimetic CO 2 absorption was performed using SspCA (from the extreme thermophilic bacteria Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense YO3AOP1) immobilized in a polyurethane foam and water at 298 K and liquid to gas ratio varying from 0.15 to 0.2. After rounds of experiments, it was possible to achieve up to 45% of CO 2 conversion efficiency of absorption, 19-fold more than the same absorption cycle without the enzyme. Additionally, the immobilized CA was very stable and showed no loss of activity after 30 days (Migliardini et al., 2014). It is interesting to note that despite the described thermophilicity of the enzyme, improvement of CO 2 capture at 298 K was observed with CA addition. This indicates, that SspCA may operate at a wide range of temperatures having a positive effect on CO 2 capture.Besides various examples of immobilized CA applied to biomimetic route, examples addressing this approach at pilot-scale are still few.

        <p>Additionally, a vertical reactor employing water as solvent and loaded with BCA cross-linked in alginate beads, and concentrations ranging up to 4 mg/l, demonstrated an increase of CO 2 absorption rate through experiments where pH values were assessed over time. Using enzyme load of 1 mg, pH values could reach almost 5.5 after 150 s of reaction, while the uncatalyzed reaction presented pH values above 6.1 for the same period. During the experiments, the reusability of the biocatalyst was tested -which maintained 61% of its initial activity after 6 rounds of CO 2 absorption. Furthermore, the biocatalyst proved to resist at lower pH valuescaused by the formation of bicarbonate ions after the absorption (Zhu et al., 2016b). The authors also emphasized the viability of adapting such system to an on-site scrubber, given the positive results with the immobilized CA.Additionally, a vertical reactor employing water as solvent and loaded with BCA cross-linked in alginate beads, and concentrations ranging up to 4 mg/l, demonstrated an increase of CO 2 absorption rate through experiments where pH values were assessed over time.

        <p>More recently, the idea of employing materials and residues of industrial processes as sequestrating agents, such as silicates, carbonates, and oxide-based sub-products to promote CO 2 absorption has gained attention. For exploiting such materials in CO 2 absorption systems, though, an approach inspired in the process of mineral chemical weathering (rock and soil breaking/dissolution), where the material has its chemical composition modified (Jackson and Sherman, 1953), can be utilized. For rich-carbonate sources (i.e calcite and dolomite), for example, the weathering process occurs through the dissolution of carbonates into bicarbonates (CTB), eq. 10, similar to the Karst process. The process occurs in two steps, the first is related to the CO 2 hydration (eq. (.1)) and the second is the dissolution of the carbonate itself.More recently, the idea of employing materials and residues of industrial processes as sequestrating agents, such as silicates, carbonates, and oxide-based sub-products to promote CO 2 absorption has gained attention.

Through pNPA assays, results revealed that the enzyme kept 54% of initial activity after incubation in MDEA 3 M, versus 33% reached in MEA 3 M. Incubation in 1 M MAPA/2 M MDEA resulted in higher remaining activity than MDEA (69%) while all the others had an inferior performance. The effect of solvent concentration (1-3 M) on enzyme stability after 100 h of incubation, at 298 and 323 K, was also evaluated and revealed that the activity loss was not so accentuated.

Also, MDEA 50 wt% was tested, and a decrease in 11-43% of the absorption capacity of the solvent was measured, being this effect proportional to higher specific liquid loads. Possibly, the high concentration of MDEA limits the formation of bicarbonate ions (and CO 2 absorption) once the amount of water available in this solution is lower than at 30 wt% MDEA solution, evidencing that higher amine concentrations had a negative impact on CO 2 capture performance of CA.

        <p>Utilizing a pilot scale unit, Kunze et al. (2015) evaluated the performance of amine solvents (MDEA and diethylethanolamine DEEA both at 30 wt%) to capture carbon, besides MEA. In an initial assessment in a spray reactor at 296 K, and CA concentration at 0.2 wt%, MDEA and DEEA showed an enhancement of CO 2 absorption rate (named catalytic effect) of 4.3 and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Agreeing with Gladis et al. (2017a), CA had no effect in the increase of liquid side mass transfer coefficient, showing the enzyme did not change the mass transfer kinetics in a perceptible way. Test in a packed column with 2.3 m height, MDEA solution at 317 K, and same CA concentration showed that the enhancement in CO 2 capture (named catalytic effect) was almost the same of the one observed in the spray reactor. Besides, the liquid load (u L ) in the column was varied, and a proportional positive influence in the catalytic effect was found -3.3 to 4.2 when u L ranged to 8-24.4 m 3 m -2 h -1 . In comparative terms, the MDEA solution was able to capture 14 and 35% of the total of CO 2 absorbed by a MEA solution, when tested without and with the CA at 313 K. The overall mass transfer coefficient reached around 30% of the one observed with MEA. In relative terms, the enzyme enhanced the CO 2 absorption rate by 237% in the MDEA solution, however, when confronted to MEA, the overall absorption was still almost 3-fold smaller, evidencing the opportunity window for potential improvement in this type of system. As an example, for future evaluations, the system integration to a desorption unit can bring insights into CO 2 regeneration efficiency and energy demand, which could provide a more reliable comparison with MEA absorption systems. Remarkably, Liu et al. (2017) conducted an evaluation to explore if BCA would have effect in improving kinetics in aqueous solutions of MEA with high loads of CO 2 . The experiments were done with MEA at 30 wt%, and BCA was added to the solutions at a concentration of 10 mg/l in a stirred reactor pressurized with CO 2 . The lower the amount of CO 2 load in the solutions, the faster were the reactions of CO 2 absorption. For the high-loaded CO 2 -MEA systems, CA had a positive effect both in increasing the amount of CO 2 absorbed and in decreasing the time of reactionan effect showing the CA indeed influenced the kinetics. The results brought a different perspective in terms of CO 2 absorption with MEA assisted by CA, once diverse studies assessed it before, however not completely exploring the effect of CA in high CO 2 loading solutions. Consequently, CA could benefit MEA absorption column design once the acceleration on the CO 2 capture at higher stages of the absorber (near saturation), potentially would eliminate some absorption stages, and then reduce the column size.Utilizing a pilot scale unit, Kunze et al.

Besides, the liquid load (u L ) in the column was varied, and a proportional positive influence in the catalytic effect was found -3.3 to 4.2 when u L ranged to 8-24.4 m 3 m -2 h -1 . In comparative terms, the MDEA solution was able to capture 14 and 35% of the total of CO 2 absorbed by a MEA solution, when tested without and with the CA at 313 K. The overall mass transfer coefficient reached around 30% of the one observed with MEA. In relative terms, the enzyme enhanced the CO 2 absorption rate by 237% in the MDEA solution, however, when confronted to MEA, the overall absorption was still almost 3-fold smaller, evidencing the opportunity window for potential improvement in this type of system. As an example, for future evaluations, the system integration to a desorption unit can bring insights into CO 2 regeneration efficiency and energy demand, which could provide a more reliable comparison with MEA absorption systems. Remarkably, Liu et al. (2017) conducted an evaluation to explore if BCA would have effect in improving kinetics in aqueous solutions of MEA with high loads of CO 2 . The experiments were done with MEA at 30 wt%, and BCA was added to the solutions at a concentration of 10 mg/l in a stirred reactor pressurized with CO 2 . The lower the amount of CO 2 load in the solutions, the faster were the reactions of CO 2 absorption. For the high-loaded CO 2 -MEA systems, CA had a positive effect both in increasing the amount of CO 2 absorbed and in decreasing the time of reactionan effect showing the CA indeed influenced the kinetics. The results brought a different perspective in terms of CO 2 absorption with MEA assisted by CA, once diverse studies assessed it before, however not completely exploring the effect of CA in high CO 2 loading solutions. Consequently, CA could benefit MEA absorption column design once the acceleration on the CO 2 capture at higher stages of the absorber (near saturation), potentially would eliminate some absorption stages, and then reduce the column size.</p>
        <p>Employing a pilot experimental arrangement, in a 10-m packed column with different sample collection points, parameters such as the column height, temperature, and solvent loading were evaluated to determine their influence in absorption performance. A solution of MDEA 30 wt% was tested with and without using CA. Results showed the temperature had a negative effect on the absorption, reducing from around 73 to 40 mol/h of absorbed CO 2 in the column, when evaluated at 313 and 291 K, respectively. The effect was probably caused by the lower amount of CO 2 dissolved at higher temperatures. Column height impacted also in the CO 2 absorption, being observed a sharp increase of CO 2 absorption up to 6 m-heightthen, at heights of 8 and 10 m a more discrete increase was observed. Additionally, at higher liquid loads, higher the mass transfer was observedincreasing in almost 80% the moles transferred in the gas to liquid interface at 291 K when liquid load increased from 10 to 22 m 3 m -2 h -1 . Another interesting aspect to highlight, was the positive effect of the enzyme in the desorption process: at the height of 6 m, around 77 mol/h and 32 mol/h were transferred to the amine solution in the catalyzed (at 323 K), and the uncatalyzed solution (328 K) respectively. The results evidenced CA can influence the regeneration cycle in the desorption step as well (Gladis et al., 2017b). In another study performed by the same research group, aqueous solutions of MEA and MDEA added to CA were experimented and compared. The liquid-gas ratio was varied for both solvents and showing a CO 2 efficiency capture up to 98% and 83% for MEA and MDEA with 3.5 g/l of CA, respectively. Higher L/G ratios impacted positively on efficiency capture and the enzyme has increased CO 2 absorption and mass transfer reached for MDEA experiments was almost 80% of the one observed with MEA (Gladis et al., 2019). Compared to other studies, the level of CO 2 capture efficiency was remarkable and reached values near to conventional technologies (MEA), thanks to the combination of enzyme use and technology scale-up. Performing the assessment of CO 2 efficiency capture after multiple cycles could bring a more comprehensive picture of CA activity loss after long exposure. Alvizo et al. (2014) also performed a study in a pilot scale plant utilizing DvCA 8.0 (0.2 g/l) and with MDEA at 25%. The carbon capture plant consisted of two coupled absorption (packed ring column) and desorption units installed at NCCC facilities (National Carbon Capture Center in Wilsonville) and worked at 293-313 K and at 360-373 K, respectively. The experiments lasted 60 h, distributed in 5 days of 12 h of daily operation. As result, the enzyme successfully could maintain its activity over the period of the experiment and the carbon capture observed during the run had an average of the cycle efficiency of CO capture of 63.7%. Over a period of a day and working under continuous operation, around 150 lb of CO 2 was captured. This work showed a great potential of an engineered ultra-stable CA to work in regenerative cycles and under conditions near-to-reality of industrial processes.Employing a pilot experimental arrangement, in a 10-m packed column with different sample collection points, parameters such as the column height, temperature, and solvent loading were evaluated to determine their influence in absorption performance.

        <p>In a more recent work, DvCA8.0 catalyzed CO 2 capture through the employment of novel solvent composed by amine and ionic liquid. In Sjöblom et al. (2020), an alternative solvent, consisting of a mix of MDEA (20%) and pentaethylenehexamine prolinate (PEHAp) (5%), was proposed aiming to reach both higher CO 2 absorption rates than a MDEA based absorbent and lower energy requirements in its desorption process when compared to conventional alkanolamines, such as MEA. The addition of an ionic liquid containing proline brings a protective effect for the enzyme, due to its hydrophobic character, and enhanced properties of regeneration, once it has a lower heat of absorption, given the formation of bicarbonates instead carbamate when compared to alkanolamines. During the absorption experiments, the developed solvent exhibited 5-fold higher CO 2 absorption rate than a solution utilizing MDEA 25%. Also, an increase in 31.7% of the CO 2 mass absorbed was reached for the new solvent when compared to the uncatalyzed reaction, as well as an increase in 1.4-fold in the initial reaction rate. For the desorption, the MDEA/PEHAp solvent showed 2-fold better regeneration than MEA. Here, the combination of a MDEA-stable CA variant and solvents with distinctive properties enabled not only an increased CO absorption when compared to MDEA, but also aimed to enzyme preservation from inactivation during the reaction. Additionally, the benefit in the regeneration improvement is equally important to create more sustainable CO 2 absorption processes. Using sterically hindered amines, the kinetics of absorption for two different amines, 2-amino-2-ethyl-1, 3-propanediol (AEPD) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (AMPD), was evaluated in reactions with and without BCA. The experiments were performed in stopped flow experiments using both solvents over a spectrum of concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 M, temperatures varying from 298 to 353 K and CA fixed at concentration of 0.1 g/l (Cihan and Orhan, 2020). Above 338 K, a sharp decrease was observed, possibly occasioned by the enzyme denaturation. Using a thermostable CA could be helpful to elucidate if the findings are related only to the loss in CA activity, or CA is still active but cannot compensate for the extent of CO 2 desorption that occurs under high temperatures.In a more recent work, DvCA8.0 catalyzed CO 2 capture through the employment of novel solvent composed by amine and ionic liquid.

        <p>In Ai et al. (2019), the kinetics characteristics of CO 2 absorption of a system utilizing MDEA 10 wt% and immobilized BCA in microspheres of epoxy magnetic, were evaluated. The assessment of the kinetics parameters was performed and showed k cat of 0.94 s -1 (1.15 s -1 of free form) and K m of 27.61 mmol/l. The temperature indicated a positive effect in the k 2 of CO 2 absorption, with an increase of 2.2-fold when compared to the non-enzymatic reaction (at 313.15 K). Also, at the same temperature, the concentration of CA was varied and showed 3.4-fold higher k 2 when compared to the baselinethe higher loads of the BCA, the higher values of k 2 . In terms of stability, the immobilized enzyme could keep about 92% of initial activity when incubated in MDEA at 277 K. Also, reusability tests were done, and the catalyst lost its activity at its 7th cycle showing a decreasing trend over the performed experiments. A potential limitation for immobilization techniques such as covalent bonding and CLEAs, which involve the formation of a covalent bond involving the amino group of lysine residues at the surface of the enzyme, is the potential competition for bond formation with a reactive amine instead with the amino group of lysine. Thus, a potential reason for loss of activity in covalently immobilized enzymes when used in amine-based systems could be in fact the enzyme leaching due to destabilization of covalent bonds formed between CA lysine amino groups and the support. For the CO 2 absorption experiments, the reaction took place in a stirred cell reactor, at 313.15 K and concentration of CA 5.33 mg/l. Results showed a 1.4 higher reaction rate in its beginning increasing from 0.45 to 0.63 mmol min -1 for the uncatalyzed and enzymatic reaction, respectively. Additionally, the time needed to reach saturation was smaller than the baseline without catalyst, evidencing the higher constant rates for the catalyzed system and the positive effect of the CA with MDEA.In Ai et al.

        <p>Utilizing a novel matrix composed of iron and zinc oxides and a thermal resistant CA (PCA),. Sahoo et al. (2017a) immobilized this CA through encapsulation to test its potential for utilization in both absorption and desorption processes in MEA 30 wt%. Stability studies revealed the catalyst could keep about 70% of its initial activity when exposed to a temperature of 363 K for 1 h. Furthermore, repeatability tests proved the enzyme was highly attached to the matrixresults showed no loss on activity after 15 repeated cycles, showing the method held the enzyme enclosed in the matrix. For the kinetic parameters, K m and k cat were found to be 0.26 mM and 0.97 × 10 2 s -1 when assessed from pNPA assays. As results of the CO 2 absorption experiment, the load of CO 2 per mol of MEA increased 2-fold compared to the uncatalyzed one. During the regeneration process, the immobilized CA enabled a desorption 2.6 higher than the neat solvent. Upon reaction with aqueous MEA solutions, the CO 2 captured forms carbamates and bicarbonates, being this second favored to desorb in the presence of CA. Because bicarbonates have lower energy of absorption, the desorption demands less energy, resulting in an overall benefit in terms of energy spent for mole CO 2 desorbed. Comparing the above immobilization methods, encapsulation brought a more superior CA stability than the covalent bonding since reactive amines can act competitively to the covalent attachment of the enzyme with the support. Also, the system CA-MEA presented a lower value of regeneration heat, explaining the better performance for CO 2 regeneration than the neat solvent. Besides, the authors highlight that the possible interaction among support-carbamates could cause instability on the N-C bond, resulting in higher CO 2 desorption at lower temperatures. Other works utilized ZIF-8 to immobilize BCA, through in situ encapsulation. In Du et al. (2020), the enzyme kinetics parameters for free and immobilized enzyme were evaluated in home-made stirred tank utilizing 1 M MDEA at 313 K. As results, the V m and K m found -1.85 mM s -1 and 1.39 mM were slightly different from the free form, suggesting the immobilization process decreased the CA activity. Also, the reusability was tested, and after 6 cycles 70% of the initial CO 2 absorption rate was kept. With encouraging results, Zhang et al. (2018) tested the performance of the immobilized enzyme (BCA in ZIF-8) for CO 2 absorption with MDEA at 1 M and 313 K. The biocatalyst showed improved activity 1.5-fold higher than its free form, had high stability to temperature, and great reusability once 134% of apparent catalytic activity after 6 cycles was kept. The CO 2 absorption experiments showed 5.27-fold more absorption than baseline without the catalyst and happened at 313 K.

(2017b) in a work in which a thermostable CA from P. fragi was covalently immobilized and tested in a blend composed of MEA 30 wt%, piperazine 5 wt%, and potassium carbonate 15 wt%. The enzyme and a Zn-Imidazole complex were bonded to hetero-functional support (HFS) and showed improved characteristics when tested for the developed solvent. To assess the enzyme stability in the designed solvent, the immobilized CA was stored in the blend and solution of MEA 30%. After, through a pNPA assay, the k cat /K m was calculated and revealed the newly designed blend 1.48-fold higher catalytic efficiency when compared to the only MDEA based solution. For both only CA and CA with Zn-Im complex, the HFS was able to guarantee high stability after storing the hybrid solvent and the k cat /K m decreased less than 5% after incubated for 1 h. When the enzyme was integrated with MEA in CO 2 capture, an improvement of 19% in CO capture was detected. Also, the desorption process could benefit from the CA presence and showed 1.57 higher kinetics than the neat solvent. The proposal of a MEA-based solvent compatible with CA is inspirational, once it combines the high CO 2 capture typically observed with MEA but offering with lower regeneration heat due to formation of bicarbonate by CA.Interestingly, a novelty in terms of solvent development was proposed by Sahoo et al.

The solvent and CO 2 mixture streams run in counter-current mode. The immobilized CA enhanced CO 2 absorption in 1.47-fold, when the specific liquid load of the column was 8 m 3 m -2 h -1 . The experiments with free enzyme were carried out with a CA load 50 times higher than the immobilized form, showing only 2.3-fold higher CO 2 capture yield, which could be related to the mass transfer phenomena limiting substrate availability. Also, higher specific enzyme loads led to limiting the enhancement of CO 2 capture, however, an overall improvement occurred during all experiments. The immobilized biocatalyst increased the mass transfer resistance in the column, impairing the diffusion of the substrate towards the enzyme, which also explains the lower CO 2 capture performance compared to the free counterpart. Tests increasing the current CA concentration and the use of CAs would be helpful to verify the equipment performance limitations. Other information CO 2 absorption studies employing immobilized CA and amines are shown in Table 9. CAs have been proved to be compatible with amine-based solvents, improving CO 2 absorption. However, other variables would be valuable to explore in future research works. Experiments employing industrial exhausted gases, as done in Alvizo et al. (2014), can elucidate the inhibitory effect of NO x and SO x in the absorption reaction. Also, studies of enzyme kinetics amine-derivate solvents are still few. Also, it is worth addressing efforts in process design optimization since limitations in mass transfer occasioned by the CO 2 capture devices can meaningfully affect the reaction. Improving the total mass transfer coefficient by altering the conditions of liquid and gas flow rates could be recommended. Issues related to liquid stagnation and the creation of solvent preferential paths can be especially relevant with immobilized CAs. It should be noted, though, that increasing the convection and turbulence can be detrimental to the biocatalyst structure, causing undesired effects as enzyme leaching and support wearing.Besides studies encompassing CO 2 absorption in pilot plants with amines and immobilized CA (Novozymes) are still limited in this field, however some examples exist, such as the work developed by Leimbrink et al.

        <p>The validation of CA for catalysts that have similar properties in CO hydration has been also a topic in the context of CO 2 absorption, where the synthesized compound contains a structure that mimics the CA active site. The utilization of metallic ions (such Zn +2 ) connected to other ligands, such as amino acid residues and chelates generally occurs in such approaches (Sahoo et al., 2018). Indicatively, mimics based on a zinc-cyclen, MOF, zinc-based eutectic solvents, zinc complexes of tripodal peptides, and other compounds have been reported the past decade as possible alternatives to CA.The validation of CA for catalysts that have similar properties in CO hydration has been also a topic in the context of CO 2 absorption, where the synthesized compound contains a structure that mimics the CA active site.

        <p>The mimics have been demonstrating positive results in improving temperature and pH stability and reusability (Floyd et al., 2013) (Jin et al., 2018) (Widger et al., 2019). However, significant drawbacks related to the low activity compared to CA, and performance decrease under the presence of bicarbonates have been reported. Other major related challenges concern the lower selectivity compared to CAs, as the mimic may have a tendency to dimerize, which introduces undesirable side reactions in the system. Moreover, the difficulties in orientating the CO 2 molecule towards the active site due to the lack of hydrophobic pocket as occurred in CAs, reduces the catalytic efficiency of the compound (Kelsey et al., 2015). Thus, mimics have not yet surpassed one of the most important advantages of enzymes as biocatalysts, which is the high specificity and exceptional selectivity, eliminating byproduct formation.The mimics have been demonstrating positive results in improving temperature and pH stability and reusability (Floyd et al., 2013) (Jin et al., 2018) (Widger et al., 2019).

        <p>Another factor regarding the impact and cost effectiveness of (bio) catalysts is their upstream and downstream production process. Enzyme production involves the use of microorganism and their growth entails the utilization of simple and low cost chemicals, such salts and culture media components. Downstream processing is defined with simple unit operations (i.e. filtration) which do not require high consumption of hazardous chemicals or high demanding energy equipment. On the other hand, in chemical synthesis of CA mimics high temperatures can be demanded, as well as, additional purification processes, which can be a disadvantage. Additionally, the possible need of high pressure and/or temperature of some mimics to initiate the reaction can limit their application in existent CO 2 absorption systems.Another factor regarding the impact and cost effectiveness of (bio) catalysts is their upstream and downstream production process.

        <p>Utilization of CA as a promoter for enhancing CO 2 capture seems to be a very tangible opportunity. On the other hand, obstacles related to costs, scaling up and lack of integration to the industrial environment can impede the participation of the enzyme in CO 2 absorption at greater scales in a near future. On the other hand, CA can bring benefits if applied in industrial scales. Among them, there is the possibility of reducing investment costs, by reducing size of absorbers. Besides, decrease on operational costs are also possible, given the CA can result in lower energy duty for the regeneration step. Also, due to the enhancement of CO 2 capture per mass of solvent, lower amounts of solvent are required.Utilization of CA as a promoter for enhancing CO 2 capture seems to be a very tangible opportunity.

        <p>Penders-van Elk et al. ( 2013) assessed how CA addition in the process of CO 2 absorption would affect the absorber size. Through process simulations and employing two difference solvents (MDEA and Na 2 CO 3 ) with 0.5-1.0% kg m -3 of the enzyme, the height of absorption columns was estimated. The CA had a dramatic effect in the kinetics and led to a decrease on absorber height more than 90% in both cases. As consequence, a direct impact in reducing the capital costs of the absorber unit can be expected. Economic assessments also including a stripper unit would be valuable to compare the economic feasibility of the system with traditional MEA-based systems.Penders-van Elk et al.

        <p>Nonetheless, to reach efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable CO 2 capture by absorption, it is necessary to encompass all the bottlenecks that limit this process. Employment of sorbents with improved performance solvents are a must and have been continually assessed over years. As demonstrated in several studies, the gold standard MEA faces a series of limitations, such as low load capacity (0.5-0.61 mol/mol amine), corrosion and high regeneration energy. For absorption processes, solvents with good capacity of absorbing CO 2 at low pressures are imperative as well, since these set-ups operate typically up to 3 bar.Nonetheless, to reach efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable CO 2 capture by absorption, it is necessary to encompass all the bottlenecks that limit this process.

        <p>Here, it is interesting to highlight that the study did not assess the use of CA, however there is the potential of them to be studied and combined with CA to boost its kinetics, opening a new range of opportunities for developing novel CA-solvent systems suitable to CO 2 absorption. Under the spectra of processes, improvements can also be done. In a technical assessment performed by Beiron et al. (2019) the length of an absorber column utilizing water and NaOH as solvent was estimated as well as the mass flow needed in four industrial plants -with different levels of CO 2 emissions each one, ranging from 0.33 to 80 kg/s. The study was performed through simulations in 
            <rs type="software">ASPEN Plus</rs>, assuming CA is utilized under its immobilized form in a packed column filled with Sulzer-Katapak-SP. The results showed the amount of water flow rate needed varied from 3 to 6200 kg/s and the NaOH from 0.35 to 64.4 kg/s. All the assessments were found to be technically feasible. However, for plants with high levels of CO 2 emissions per year, the high demands for both water and sodium hydroxide make this alternative likely to not be economically sustainable. The study brings a perspective of substitution of alkali solvents (carbonate or amine-base) for water, which in terms of environmental impact and further disposal, is easier to be handled. However, the implementation of such system implies that a reliable water access might exist, limiting its construction to specific geographic regions. Once the model was based in existent experimental kinetic parameters for the immobilized CA, it exists the opportunity of exploring other variables such as transport phenomena effects, and different types of material for immobilization to reach a more favorable CA kineticswhich could result in more advantageous scenarios in term of CO 2 capture efficiency and costs. For that, an economic assessment is necessary to determine the real feasibility of implementing such solution.

        <p>Aiming to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of capturing CO 2 from exhaust gases with sequestration efficiency of 90% in a power plant with capacity of 600 MW e , two different configurations of CO 2 capture systems were assessed: one with membrane separation technology and the second composed of a CA enzymatic-assisted absorption/desorption system, utilizing potassium carbonate solution as solvent. Simulations followed by an optimization model were performed in both scenarios, reaching to minimize the costs, CAPEX and OPEX for each solution, and created solutions were compared. For the membrane technology case, the driving force of the separation process was maximized; for the enzymatic absorption technology, the relationship between the lean conversion of carbonate to bicarbonate and energy for CO 2 regeneration were verified. The scenario utilizing the aqueous CA absorption system provided more advantageous economic results and slightly lower internal electricity consumption (89.13 vs 95.14 MW, without CO 2 compression) than the one using membrane-based separation process. As a matter of comparison, the first case presented total CO 2 capture annual costs of 27.85 and 47.34 $M/ton CO 2 , the second. Thanks to the use of vacuum desorption at 0.4 bar, the employment of lower steam quality from the turbine is possible, which permits a better more efficient electricity production, especially when compared to MEA whose stripping processes requires higher temperatures (Gilassi et al., 2020). In a further work, the same authors evaluated a hybrid plant using both technologies to sequestrate CO 2 . Compared to the standalone CA-assisted CO 2 absorption/desorption unit studied in their previous work, both the total costs of CO 2 captured, and total annual costs increased, being them between 36.1 and 36.5 $M/ton CO2 and 137.9 to 139.3 $M per year. However, there were some reduction in the total amount of energy required and decrease of the amount of circulating solvent from 33.4 to 33.6 to 13-19 m 3 /h, what also impact as well in the consume of enzyme, potassium carbonate and electricity destined to pumps and vacuum devices. Overall, the studies show the potential of the technologies to capture CO 2 instead of MEA conventional systems; specially the enzymatic-assisted absorption, which is a most mature technology than the membrane. Drawbacks are basically related to the fact of high enzyme costs (here assumed to be $ 480.00/kg) and overall CAPEX/OPEX, high electricity and water consumption, and still, a lower absorption capacity compared to other conventional amine processes (Gilassi et al., 2021).Aiming to evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of capturing CO 2 from exhaust gases with sequestration efficiency of 90% in a power plant with capacity of 600 MW e , two different configurations of CO 2 capture systems were assessed: one with membrane separation technology and the second composed of a CA enzymatic-assisted absorption/desorption system, utilizing potassium carbonate solution as solvent.

        <p>Not only to determine which technology guarantees better cost-benefit in CO 2 capture, it is important also to understand the overall picture in terms of embodied CO 2 emissions and the environmental impacts are brought during the construction and life operation of a new facility. Comparing 3 different technologies, Saunier et al. (2019) performed a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment for CO 2 capture in a coal-fired power plant with capacity of 550 MW. The systems chosen consisted of a MEA-based absorption technology (MEA process), an enzyme-assisted system employing potassium carbonate solution as solvent (CIS process) and, a separation technology which is based on the precipitation of potassium carbonate (UNO MK3). The plants were assumed to have CO capture efficiency of 90%. The results showed that CIS had, for the four endpoint indicators assessed (climate change, human health, ecosystem quality and resources), 50-54% of the environmental impact the MEA-based presented. The UNO MK3 system was comparatively better than the MEA, however still had high impact than the CIS (approx. 70-78% of MEA system). The lower impact scores for the CIS technology happened basically because of no need of steam in its regeneration process and favorable kinetics. The environmental performance of the CIS process is more attractive, especially in a scenario where mitigation of climate change is a priority. For the proper selection of enzyme-assisted CO capture systems, a compromise between cost-benefit, CO 2 capture efficiency and environmental costs should be targeted. Other facts such technological spillovers, market changes impacting the enzyme costs could also strengthen the technology competitiveness.Not only to determine which technology guarantees better cost-benefit in CO 2 capture, it is important also to understand the overall picture in terms of embodied CO 2 emissions and the environmental impacts are brought during the construction and life operation of a new facility.
