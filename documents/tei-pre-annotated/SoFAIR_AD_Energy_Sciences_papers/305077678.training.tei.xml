        <p>CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 catalyst exhibited consistent performance in a wide pH range from 5.0 to 10.0, and the degradation kinetics were not inhibited by the common free radical scavengers, anions or natural organic matter. Quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) revealed the relationship between the degradation rate constant of 14 substituted phenols and their conventional descriptor variables (i.e. Hammett constants σ, σ -, σ + ), half-wave oxidation potential (E 1/2 ) and pK a values. QSARs together with kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) recognized the electron transfer as the dominant oxidation process.

        <p>The worldwide water and soil pollution demanded strongly to develop an effective remediation technology. Recently, chemical oxidation based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) or peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation has attracted many research groups owing to the generation of powerful hydroxyl (•OH), sulfate (SO 4 •-) or both radicals. [1][2][3][4][5] Various strategies such as light, heat, ultrasound, electricity and transition metals can be adopted to generate these radicals during the activation of persulfate. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Among various strategies, transition metals (Co 2+ , Fe 2+ , Cu 2+ , Mn 2+ ), their oxides (Co 3 O 4 , Fe 3 O 4 , CuO, MnO 2 ) and bimetallic composites (CuFe 2 O 4 , CuO-Fe 3 O 4 , Mn 1.8 Fe 1.2 O 4 etc.) were recognized as the most efficient approaches. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] In addition, the persulfate activation through a similar pathway can also be achieved using biochar, reduced graphene oxides, carbon nanotubes and N-doped graphene. [12][13][14][15] The effectiveness of advance oxidation systems (H 2 O 2 /PMS/PS) relies on the strong oxidizing power of free radicals (hydroxyl •OH E 0 1.9-2.7 V and sulfate SO 4 •-E 0 2.5-3.1 V) towards a broad spectrum of recalcitrant pollutants. [12][13][14][15][16][17] However, it can cause undesirable catalytic durability due to its high reactivity for both the target compounds and competing organic/inorganic constituents of water. [18][19][20] Meanwhile, the difficulty in the regeneration of actives sites due to the energetically unfavorable redox cycles is also considered one of the major drawback in their practical application.The worldwide water and soil pollution demanded strongly to develop an effective remediation technology.

        <p>Alternately, the recently discovered non-radical oxidative pathway is highly selective for electron rich organic pollutants, which can reduce the amount of side products. [21][22][23] The nonradical process requires small amount of oxidants, and the degradation kinetics were less influenced by the competing organic/inorganic constituents or radical scavengers. 22 Nonradicals oxidative pathway can be broadly categorized into surface activated complex, electron transfer mediation and singlet oxygen. The surface activated complex is resulted from the activation of persulfates at the surface of catalysts and is considered completely different from the free radical oxidation. For example, copper oxides were reported to generate surface metastable complex during the activation of PDS, 21 where the degradation kinetic of 2,4dichlorophenol was unaffected by excess amounts of Cl⁻ ions or radical scavengers. Similarly, Pd-Al 2 O 3 catalyst mediated electron transfer from organics to PMS, and such persulfate driven activation exhibited a substrate selectivity which was similar to the carbon nano-tube/PMS system. [22][23] In contrast, a substrate selective surface-bound SO 4 •-radical mechanism was proposed for Pd-Al 2 O 3 /PMS system, where the degradation kinetic of 1,4-dioxane was strongly scavenged by radicals scavengers. 24 Contradicting to these reports, certain recent studies have reported the presence of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) as another type of nonradical process. [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32] The 1 O 2 -based pathway is also popular for their resistance to popular scavengers and background substances in water matrix.Alternately, the recently discovered non-radical oxidative pathway is highly selective for electron rich organic pollutants, which can reduce the amount of side products.

        <p>Using metal oxides, we recognized that there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the identification of reactive species. For example, CuO alone or its composite with the oxides of other metals is reported to produce •SO 4 -, •OH, surface bound complex or singlet oxygen during persulfate activation. 8,21,29,33 Similar kind of uncertainty also exist for the oxides of other metals, 22,23,26,[31][32]34 reflecting that the mechanism behind the identification of reactive species is ambiguous which needs further explorations. Most importantly, it is unclear that how the reaction pathway changes, how non-radical 1 O 2 -PMS activation dominate and how it contributes in the degradation process yet to be answered.Using metal oxides, we recognized that there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the identification of reactive species.

        <p>In this work, we surprisingly found that the incorporation of magnesium oxides (MgO) onto typical CuO/Fe 3 O 4 catalyst not only enhanced the catalytic properties, but also switched the free radical peroxymonosulfate-activated process into the 1 O 2 based nonradical process. There is an urgent need to explain not only the positive aspects of MgO in catalysis but also disclose the deeper insight behind the 1 O 2 -based nonradical activation of PMS. Based on various spectroscopic evidences and DFT calculations, the switching of reaction mechanism was related to the transfer of Cu ions into highly electron deficient state and presence of extensive surface OH groups after the incorporation of MgO. Furthermore, chemical scavenger tests, EPR observation, the solvent dependency, FFA degradation as 1 O 2 -indicator, pH studies, complexation behaviors and the comparison with Rose Bengal (RB), a well-known 1 O 2 -photo sensitize system, 35 were conducted to address the knowledge gap in the identification and generation mechanism of 1 O 2 in CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system. The linear free energy relationships (LFERs) between the degradation rate constants of 14 substituted phenols and conventional descriptor variables (i.e. Hammett constant σ, σ -, σ + ), quantitative structure activity relationship (QSARs) and kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) revealed the electron transfer between the organic substrate in singlet oxygen dominated process.In this work, we surprisingly found that the incorporation of magnesium oxides (MgO) onto typical CuO/Fe 3 O 4 catalyst not only enhanced the catalytic properties, but also switched the free radical peroxymonosulfate-activated process into the 1 O 2 based nonradical process.

        <p>Sulfate (SO 4 • -) and hydroxyl (•OH) radicals have been reported as the dominant reactive species in PMS activated systems. [21][22][23][24] Firstly, tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and ethanol were applied in excess amount (1000 fold) as selective radical scavengers for •OH and SO 4 • -radicals because of their dissimilar second-order rate constants. For example, TBA react quickly with ) and thus can used to trap both radicals. 7 As shown in Figure 2A and Figure S14, the inhibitory effect of both these scavengers were negligible for CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system as k obs only changes from 0.162 min -1 to 0.150 min -1 or 0.152 min -1 after applying excess amount of ethanol or TBA. In contrast, the degradation rate of 4-CP in the CuO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system decreased from 0.01 min -1 to 0.008 min -1 in the presence of ethanol and to 0.004 min -1 in the presence of TBA (Figure S15). Similarly, for the CuO+PMS system, the degradation rate of 4-CP was also influenced by both ethanol and TBA (Figure S16).

For example, almost 90% inhibition with a decrease in the degradation rate from the initial 0.16 min -1 to 0.006 min -1 was noted after adding 100 mM NaN 3 . In contrast, the degradation rate of 4-CP in the presence of CuO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS was barely affected (Figure S19).

[21][22][23][24] Firstly, tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) and ethanol were applied in excess amount (1000 fold) as selective radical scavengers for •OH and SO 4 • -radicals because of their dissimilar second-order rate constants. For example, TBA react quickly with ) and thus can used to trap both radicals. 7 As shown in Figure 2A and Figure S14, the inhibitory effect of both these scavengers were negligible for CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system as k obs only changes from 0.162 min -1 to 0.150 min -1 or 0.152 min -1 after applying excess amount of ethanol or TBA.

        <p>Another property is the type of complexation (inner-sphere vs. outer-sphere) of PMS to decide the nature of dominant mechanism. 7,21 Therefore, we studied the complexation behavior of PMS at the surface of CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 and CuO/Fe 3 O 4 at increasing ionic strength (taken as 1-100 mM NaClO 4 ). In the case of CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 , the degradation of 4-CP was significantly influenced at increasing ionic strength (Figure S25). This relationship revealed that the interaction between the CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 and PMS occurred through the outer-sphere surface complexation because the increasing ionic strength inhibited the electrostatic interactions between the PMS molecules and catalyst particles. In contrast, the degradation of 4-CP was not influenced for CuO/Fe 3 O 4 at increasing ionic strength due to presence of the inner-sphere complexation (covalent or ionic bonding) between the catalyst particles and PMS molecules (Figure S26). 7,21 ATR-FTIR spectra was further applied to visualize the inner-sphere complexation of S-O bond coming from the PMS in the range of 1249-1060 cm -1 . 21 As shown (Figure 3A), we obtained the evidence of bonding PMS at the surface of catalyst in the IR range of 1101-1097 cm -1 for radical dominant systems (CuO/PMS or CuO/Fe 3 O 4 /PMS).

        <p>Since, HPO 4 -offer strong affinity to replace the surface OH groups of catalyst and interact directly the active sites through inner sphere complexation. 53 Therefore, it is expected that the application of H 2 PO 4 during 4-CP degradation would disturb the H-bonding interactions of PMS and surface OH groups. As shown (Figure S31), the significant influence on 4-CP degradation in the presence of H 2 PO 4 is related to the unavailability of surface hydroxyl groups to interact PMS and thus gives direct evidence for the importance of surface OH groups. These results thus gives us enough evidences to support the switching of PMS complexation from inner-sphere to outer-sphere was related to the presence of extensive surface hydroxyl groups after MgO incorporation, responsible for generating different reactive species.Since, HPO 4 -offer strong affinity to replace the surface OH groups of catalyst and interact directly the active sites through inner sphere complexation. 53 Therefore, it is expected that the application of H 2 PO 4 during 4-CP degradation would disturb the H-bonding interactions of PMS and surface OH groups.

        <p>The incorporation of redox-inactive MgO not only influences the reaction mechanism but also changes some of the properties of heterogeneous catalyst such as stability. As disclosed above, the leaching of both Cu 2+ and Fe 2+ ions was better controlled in CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 as compared to CuO or CuO/Fe 3 O 4 (Table S2). This small leaching of metals ions also influenced the stability of CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 . As shown in Figure 3C, the reused CuO/Fe 3 O 4 catalyst induced a continuous decrease in the removal of 4-CP after each circle, whereas CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 remained stable with approximately 100% removal in all reuse experiments. Furthermore, the stability of the catalysts were also evaluated after comparing the structure changes before and after the reaction. As shown in Figure S39 A, certain XRD peaks of CuO/Fe 3 O 4 structure completely disappeared after the 5 th cycle, suggesting a poor structure stability during the catalytic reaction. In contrast, the XRD spectra of CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 remained the same even after the 5 th cycle, with only a small decrease in the intensity for certain side peaks (Figure S39 B). These results were also consistent with a much lower leaching of copper ions when MgO was incorporated (Figure S40).

        <p>Firstly, the removal trend of 4-CP under different initial pHs corresponded to the final pH of solution (Figure S43). As shown, the eventual pH after the reaction remained stable at pH 9. 0 ± 0.5 in the initial pHs ranged from 5.0 to10.0. Thus the relatively constant performance (k= 0.12 ~ 0.16 min -1 ) in this pH range may be partly attributed to the buffer ability of CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 . In the case of RB, this phenomena does not exist. Secondly, the lower activity at pH 3.0 could be attributed to the leaching of heterogeneous catalysts (Figure S44 (Figure S46). In contrast, singlet oxygenated system (RB system) indicate significant improvements in the degradation of 4-CP at high pH, because the above negative effects did not emerge (Figure S42). This conclusion was further supported by the nonlinear relationship between the degradation rate constants k and F factor calculated from Eq. 10, 26 (Figure S47), which also suggested the that the decrease of 4-CP degradation at high pH was resulted from the surface electrostatic repulsion.Firstly, the removal trend of 4-CP under different initial pHs corresponded to the final pH of solution (Figure S43).

        <p>Normally, their existence negatively influences the efficiency of radical-based advanced oxidation processes. Both •OH and SO 4 -• radicals tend to be rapidly scavenged by halogens ions with a high reaction rate constants (k SO4-•/Cl-= (3.2 ± 0.2) × 10 8 M -1 s -1 , k •OH/Cl-= 4.2 × 10 9 M -1 s -1 ). 24,[59][60] Therefore, the influence of inorganic anions on the efficiency loss of the CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system was also investigated. Figure 3D depicts that the Cl -, NO 3 -, SO 4 2-and CH 3 COO -anions demonstrated negligible influences on the degradation efficiency of 4-CP. Due to the fact that •OH and SO 4 -• radicals were not produced, the small scavenging of CO 3 2-and HCO 3 -(~10-15%) might be from the selective scavenging of •O 2 -anions (CO 3 2-, k 2 = 5 × 10 8 M -1 s -1 ). 26 Additionally, humic acid (HA, a typical NOM), which is excessively found in wastewater and is considered to be another free radical scavenger. 7 The analysis showed that HA decreased the degradation of 4-CP in the initial 20 minutes. However, the scavenging effects became less important when the reaction time was extended to 40 minutes (Figure S49). The decrease in the initial 20 minutes might be related to the adsorption of HA on the surface of catalyst which could minimize the complexation of PMS to generate 1 O 2 . On extending the reaction time, enough 1 O 2 would be produced to proceed the reaction smoothly.Normally, their existence negatively influences the efficiency of radical-based advanced oxidation processes. Both •OH and SO 4 -• radicals tend to be rapidly scavenged by halogens ions with a high reaction rate constants (k SO4-•/Cl-= (3.2 ± 0.2) × 10 8 M -1 s -1 , k •OH/Cl-= 4.2 × 10 9 M -1 s -1 ). 24,[59][60] Therefore, the influence of inorganic anions on the efficiency loss of the CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system was also investigated. Figure 3D depicts that the Cl -, NO 3 -, SO 4 2-and CH 3 COO -anions demonstrated negligible influences on the degradation efficiency of 4-CP.

        <p>The degradation rate constants (k obs ) for 14 substituted phenols were calculated in CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system after applying pseudo-first order kinetics. The calculated k obs in CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system were then compared with literature values obtained for similar reactions in aqueous solution (Table S6). [60][61][62] Among the studied substituted phenols, 4-MeCONH exhibited the maximum degradation rate with k obs (0.168 min -1 ), while 4-NO 2 phenol demonstrated the slowest oxidation with k obs (0.037 min -1 ). To describe the quantitative effect of substitution on the degradation rate of these phenols, the obtained k obs values were changed to relative rates (k rel ) using 4-CP as the reference compound, as described in Eq 11.The degradation rate constants (k obs ) for 14 substituted phenols were calculated in CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS system after applying pseudo-first order kinetics.

        <p>Whereas k obs is the pseudo-first-order degradation rate of different substituted phenols and k 4- CP is the observed rate constant of 4-CP. This type of normalization is very effective to give satisfactory structure-activity relationship in persulfate activation. Using this approach, we calculated logk rel along with other substituent descriptor variables (i.e., Hammett constants σ, σ+ and σ-and E 1/2 ) (Table S7). The obtained results were then compared to the substituent descriptor variables of Wang et al, 60 using the degradation of similar substituted phenols in PMS activated system (Table S7). In the oxidative reactions of substituted phenols, Hammett constants (i.e. σ, σ + and σ -) were mostly used to quantitatively correlate the electron donating (large negative value) or electron withdrawing (large positive value) properties of substituents. [61][62][63] Of the three Hammett constants (i.e. σ, σ + and σ -), σ + give relatively good correlation (Figure 4 A and Figure S50 A,B) with linear regression as expressed in Eq. 12. The decrease in the oxidation rates of phenolic compounds with the increase of σ + (Table S7) suggested a typical electrophilic reaction between the reactive species ( 1 O 2 ) and substituted phenols.Whereas k obs is the pseudo-first-order degradation rate of different substituted phenols and k 4- CP is the observed rate constant of 4-CP.

        <p>Meanwhile, in some cases logk rel was not only correlated with the Hammett constant σ + , but also showed good linear relationship with the pK a values of organic contaminants, 64 which indicated that not only the electron transfer but the proton transfer also contribute to oxidation, as in the case of C-H bond cleavage by the non-selective radicals. In the system of CuOMgO/Fe 3 O 4 +PMS however, there was no clear correlation between the logk rel and pK a (Figure 4 C). This phenomenon together with the linear correlation of logk rel σ + and E 1/2 thus suggested the electron transfer mediated by 1 O 2 was the dominant oxidation process for organic contaminants.Meanwhile, in some cases logk rel was not only correlated with the Hammett constant σ + , but also showed good linear relationship with the pK a values of organic contaminants, 64 which indicated that not only the electron transfer but the proton transfer also contribute to oxidation, as in the case of C-H bond cleavage by the non-selective radicals.

        <p>For the first time, we found that the incorporation of MgO not only enhanced the catalytic properties but also modified the persulfate oxidation process from classical free radical mechanism to non-radical mechanism. Normally in real water applications, heterogeneous catalysts are loaded onto stable inorganic supports, which are commonly redox-inactive metal oxides. Therefore, addressing the functional roles of these redox-inactive metal oxides in regulating the environmental catalysts is of great importance. Secondly, we comprehensively investigated the unique behaviour of this non-radical process from the view of kinetics, interferences from water matrix, stability at broad pHs and the generation of toxic by-products in complex water matrix. Interestingly, no toxic BrO 3 -was produced even in the presence of spiked Br -, suggesting another advantage of 1 O 2 dominated process over classical radical ones.For the first time, we found that the incorporation of MgO not only enhanced the catalytic properties but also modified the persulfate oxidation process from classical free radical mechanism to non-radical mechanism.
