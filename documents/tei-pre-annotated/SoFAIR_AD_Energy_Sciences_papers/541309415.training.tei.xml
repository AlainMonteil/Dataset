        <p>Porous high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for water-splitting reactions, owing to their rich dissimilar active sites, elemental diversity, and multiple functionalities. The rational design of HEAs for water-splitting attracted great interest in improving their current performance, so it is essential to provide timely updates on this field. This review emphasizes the preparation methods of porous HEAs and the effect of their salient features like high configurational entropy, cocktail effect, lattice distortion, and sluggish diffusion on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

        <p>Water-splitting reactions (OER/HER) are highly efficient, green, sustainable energy production and storage sources due to their great energy output and earth-abundant oxygen (O 2 ) and hydrogen (H 2 ). [1][2][3] Ir-and Ru-based catalysts are the most active catalysts for OER, and Pt for HER [4][5]; however, the rarity, intolerable cost, and selfpoisoning of these catalysts preclude their practical utilization. [6][7][8] Unlike noble-metal-based catalysts, transition metals-based catalysts were developed for OER while chalcogenides, perovskite, carbides, and phosphides were used for HER but some carbon-based materials for OER/HER, which are low-cost and earth-abundant. [9][10][11][12][13] Distinct from traditional metal-based catalysts, HEAs possess many outstanding properties like low-level stacking fault energy, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and stability against radiation and corrosion. [14][15][16][17][18] HEAs have plentiful disparate active sites, elemental diversity, multiple functionalities, lattice distortion, and inherent surface complexity, which tune the adsorption of reactants besides retarding the adsorption of intermediates, thus accelerating water electrolysis kinetics. [14][15][16][17][18] Porous HEAs have the inimitable merits of porous morphologies like excellent surface area, low density, accessible active sites, quick molecule diffusion, and maximized atomic utilization, which tune the adsorption energies for reactants and intermediates during OER/HER. [19][20][21][22][23][24] The utilization of HEAs in water-splitting has attracted significant attention recently, culminating in 187 articles in total besides 64 articles for only porous HEAs according to the web of science (Fig. 1).

        <p>where n is the number of elements and R is the molar gas constant, but there is no maximum number of elements in HEAs, and their effects on OER/HER are still ambiguous. HEAs usually form crystalline facecentered cubic, body-centered cubic, and close-packed hexagonal structures with uniform element distribution due to the high thermal energy of their solid solutions. [15,25,27] But amorphous phases with lattice distortion are formed when there are significant differences in the atom sizes. There are various methods for preparing HEAs like carbothermal shock, electrosynthesis, mechanical milling, solvothermal pyrolysis, wet chemical, pulsed laser ablation, reactive sputter deposition, and dealloying (Table 1). [15,25,[27][28][29][30][31] However, other methods like a template, reduction, and polyol may be explored, owing to the tendency of reducing multiple metals simultaneously. [32] HEAs possess various unique merits required for enhanced water electrolysis like phase stability, cocktail effects, slow diffusion, and corrosion resistance (Fig. 2b).where n is the number of elements and R is the molar gas constant, but there is no maximum number of elements in HEAs, and their effects on OER/HER are still ambiguous.

        <p>The synergism between metals in HEAs promotes the cocktail effect, improving the thermo-electric, mechanical, magnetic properties and altering the d-band center. Upshifting the d-band strengthens the interaction of metals with the O 2 /H 2 molecule and weakens the binding energy of OER/HER intermediates. Multiple charge redistribution on the surface of HEAs resulting from different work functions of metals enriches multifunctionality. Despite the unique properties of HEAs, there are some limitations for their use for OER/HER, like lower active sites on the surface and thermodynamic stability at operating conditions.

        <p>The mechanism of HER (Fig. 4a) is classified into three steps with corresponding Tafel slope (b c ), [34] in acid: Volmer (H + + e -→ H ads ,b c = 118.2 mV/dec) involves adsorption of hydrogen ions (H + ) and electrons (e -) on catalyst's active sites to afford the intermediate adsorption (H ads ). Then, the H ads is desorbed to form H 2 by Tafel (2H ads → H 2 ; b c = 29.6 mV/dec) or Heyrovsky (H ads + H + + e -→ H 2 ; b c = 39.4 mV/dec). Thus, highly active catalysts must have moderate binding energies with low Δ G H . OER produces O 2 via several H + /e -linked methods (Fig. 4b) involving multi-step reactions via a four-electron pathway (4e -) with a high energy barrier that make OER kinetic very slow with a large overpotential (Ƞ).

        <p>This review emphasizes the fabrications of porous HEAs and the effects of their properties on OER and HER. Dealloying is the most common and promising approach for synthesizing HEAs with different morphologies like nanoporous, nanosponges, and nanosheets without substrate. The solvothermal method was also explored to prepare HEAs containing various elements like Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, and Ir. Various porous HEAs were prepared for HER, which showed Ƞ 10 ranged from 11 to 183 mV, as Pt 18 Ni 26 Fe 15 Co 14 Cu 27 /C showed the lowest Ƞ 10 of (11 mV). Various porous HEAs were synthesized for OER, which revealed Ƞ 10 ranged from 196 to 302 mV, as (CrFeCoNi) 97 O 3 revealed the lowest Ƞ 10 (196 mV) followed by P-HF-(CoCrFeNiMo) (220 mV). The outstanding OER/HER performances of HEAs aroused from the coupling between the physiochemical merits of HEAs, and the catalytic merits of porous shapes.This review emphasizes the fabrications of porous HEAs and the effects of their properties on OER and HER.
