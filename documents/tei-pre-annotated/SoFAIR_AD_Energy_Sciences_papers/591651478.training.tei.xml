        <p>Environmental innovations hold promise for cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but most technology investments are made in large technologically leading countries. Thus, emission reductions in small open economies, such as the Nordic countries, depend on not only domestic technological development, but also technology spillovers from foreign countries. The present study analysed how the development of climate change technologies affected the Nordic countries' GHG emissions from the industrial and energy sectors during a particular time frame. Consequently, while controlling for economic growth and population, domestic and foreign technological development's effects on industrial and energy sector GHG emissions were examined from the 1990-2019 period. The results revealed that both domestically developed environmental technologies and technology spillovers from foreign economies mitigated GHG emissions from these nations' energy and industrial sectors, thereby providing an efficient pathway to achieving sectoral environmental sustainability. In particular, domestic environmental technologies were found to be more efficient in driving environmental sustainability in the industrial sector, whereas impacts from domestic and foreign technological development did not differ significantly in the energy sector. Furthermore, given that economic growth plays a vital role in GHG emissions, environmental Kuznets curve (EKC; inverted U-shaped and U-shaped) relationships have been observed in the energy and industrial sectors, respectively. This suggests that the examined countries' industrial sectors have more environmental quality hurdles to overcome.Environmental innovations hold promise for cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but most technology investments are made in large technologically leading countries.

        <p>The climate crisis and the urgent problems that it poses for Earth's natural systems and human societies are viewed as the largest global challenges of our time. Consequently, more and more countries are setting ambitious targets to become carbon neutral. Simultaneously, many countries have struggled to improve their populations' economic well-being. Within current environmental discourse, development and diffusion of environmental technologies are viewed as the most costeffective ways to reduce environmental and climate pressures without compromising economic well-being. Thus, achieving carbon neutrality is expected to depend heavily on the development of new climate change mitigation technologies and the efficient transfer of these technologies globally (Popp et al., 2010;Popp, 2020). Simultaneously, economists have pointed out the risk of a rebound effect, i.e., that improvements in resource efficiency due to environmental innovation fail to elicit expected resource savings and environmental benefits, and may even lead to increasing resource use and environmental degradation in some instances, an effect also known as 'backfire' (Alcott, 2005).The climate crisis and the urgent problems that it poses for Earth's natural systems and human societies are viewed as the largest global challenges of our time.

        <p>Therefore, to shape climate policies, it is fundamentally important to clarify the impacts of environmental technological change on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, prior empirical studies have set out to analyse environmental technological development's effects on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other GHG emissions (Du et al., 2019;Hashmi and Alam, 2019;Puertas and Marti, 2021;Toebelmann and Wendler, 2020;Yıldırım et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2017). While these studies generally have indicated that environmental innovations reduce emissions, the results have not been uniform and have not indicated climate benefits in all circumstances. Thus, more empirical evidence that analyses different contexts is needed. Moreover, although domestic technological development matters, how climate technologies diffuse internationally and how these technology spillovers impact emissions from receiving countries also are important. Theoretical studies have recognised the key importance of environmental technology spillovers (Gerlagh and Kuik, 2014;Hübler et al., 2012). Few empirical studies have analysed environmental technology spillovers' impacts on environmental productivity and emissions on the sectoral and regional levels, whereas other prior studies have examined trade or foreign direct investments (FDI) as indicators of knowledge transfer (Costantini et al., 2017;Jiao et al., 2020;Cui et al., 2022;Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2022a). Nevertheless, extant literature is scant on international environmental technology spillovers' impact on country-level emissions. Finally, emission-reduction pathways differ across sectors, and sectoral characteristics need specific analyses (Erdogan et al., 2020). These are empirical literature gaps that the present study aims to address.Therefore, to shape climate policies, it is fundamentally important to clarify the impacts of environmental technological change on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

        <p>The global diffusion of climate change technologies (CCT) is particularly important for small open economies, including the Nordic countries, that depend on international trade and foreign developed technologies, thereby magnifying the importance of using environmentrelated trade policy measures to curb potential diffusion of environmentally hazardous technological innovations. However, the Nordic countries also have set stringent targets to reduce their emissions and reach net zero emissions (OECD, 2016). Since these economies' pioneering implementation of energy taxation in 1990s, primarily to soften the effects from economic woes at the time, the countries have remained global leaders in terms of environmental policy stringency and green growth approaches. Notably, given the Nordic countries' administrative and governance characteristics in terms of transparency, decentralisation and rule-based governance (Sääksjärvi, 2020), a more consistent implementation of environment-related measures among these countries is not surprising. These measures have positioned the Nordic countries as prime research subjects through which to examine domestic and foreign environmental technological development's effects.The global diffusion of climate change technologies (CCT) is particularly important for small open economies, including the Nordic countries, that depend on international trade and foreign developed technologies, thereby magnifying the importance of using environmentrelated trade policy measures to curb potential diffusion of environmentally hazardous technological innovations.

        <p>Globally, the energy and industrial sectors produce the most GHG emissions. Energy production is also crucial for countries' economic and social development. Furthermore, the industrial sector is highly relevant to economic growth in developed economies, given that the sector includes construction and manufacturing. Given the above motivation, this study examined the Nordic countries' GHG emissions from their industrial and energy sectors, and how domestic and foreign CCT development influences GHG emissions. To achieve the investigation's objective, we applied econometric approaches that include crosssectional dependency, stationarity, cointegration tests and autoregressive distributed lag panel data set analysis that covers the 1990-2019 period in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Using a novel perspective, the study contributes to prior empirical literature by examining domestic and foreign CCT spillovers' emission-reducing effects and how these effects differ across industrial and energy sectors. Furthermore, economic growth's role in GHG emissions from the energy and industrial sectors also is examined, thereby providing evidence of the environmental Kuznets curve's (EKC) (in)validity. This study also makes additional contributions by deploying the recently developed Granger causality approach, by Juodis et al. (2021), for robustness estimates. Moreover, the focus is on GHG emissions as an environmental indicator, rather than more commonly analysed CO 2 emissions.Globally, the energy and industrial sectors produce the most GHG emissions.

        <p>Environmental technological development is characterised by a double externality (Barbieri et al., 2016). First, environmental technological innovations help reduce negative environmental externalities from production and human activities. Second, like all innovations, they can produce positive knowledge spillovers that benefit other individuals and countries in addition to the initial innovator. The first externality implies that climate change technological development should lead to a reduction in CO 2 and other GHG emissions. However, the rebound effect and the Jevons paradox imply that part or even all of these climate gains may be offset, as an innovation that improves resource efficiency leads to a decrease in the effective price of that resource and, thus, demand and use of the resource will tend to increase (Alcott, 2005). Overall, large uncertainties surround macroeconomic rebound effects' size (Gillingham et al., 2016), implying that the environmental and climate impacts from environmental technological change are theoretically ambiguous and call for empirical research. Moreover, environmental technological development's second externality, positive knowledge spillovers, implies that environmental innovations also may make environmental and climate impacts in other countries aside from the original innovator.Environmental technological development is characterised by a double externality (Barbieri et al., 2016).

        <p>The empirical research on environmental innovation's impacts dovetails with the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) literature, following Grossman and Krueger (1995) and research on the IPAT model that Ehrlich and Holdren (1971) introduced. The EKC hypothesises an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental indicators and per capita income. Despite the extensive literature on EKC, the validity of the hypothesis remains under scrutiny (Stern, 2017;Sarkodie and Strezov, 2019). Meanwhile, the IPAT model and its stochastic version, Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT), model the environmental impact as a function of population, affluence and technology (Dietz and Rosa, 1994;York et al., 2003).The empirical research on environmental innovation's impacts dovetails with the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) literature, following Grossman and Krueger (1995) and research on the IPAT model that Ehrlich and Holdren (1971) introduced.

        <p>Following the theoretical literature lines, recent studies have investigated environmental innovations' impacts on emissions at national and regional levels. Most of these studies have relied on data on environmental or CCT patent applications, and in some cases R&amp;D data. Generally, these studies have found that environmental patents help reduce CO 2 and GHG emissions (Hashmi and Alam, 2019;Puertas and Marti, 2021;Toebelmann and Wendler, 2020;Zhang et al., 2017). They analysed, e.g., European countries, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and Chinese provinces. However, other studies have provided more complex results. Weina et al. (2016) reported that while environmental patents have improved Italian regions' environmental productivity, they did not reduce the regions' CO 2 emissions. Yıldırım et al. (2022) demonstrated that green patenting makes a nonlinear impact on energy sector CO 2 emissions from OECD countries. Furthermore, Du et al. (2019) analysed panel data comprising 71 countries and reported that green patents do not reduce CO 2 emissions in low-and middle-income countries, but do so in highincome countries. Thus, the empirical literature has not yet reached a comprehensive consensus on the relationship between environmental technological change and GHG emissions.Following the theoretical literature lines, recent studies have investigated environmental innovations' impacts on emissions at national and regional levels.

        <p>Moreover, the second externality produced by environmental technological development, i.e., positive knowledge spillovers that impact other individuals and countries, has received considerably less attention in the literature analysing determinants of GHG emissions. The theoretical studies following the path of endogenous growth models have recognised technology spillovers' important role in emissions (Gerlagh and Kuik, 2014;Hübler et al., 2012), and international technology diffusion's role in the context of climate change has also been examined and noted generally (Popp, 2011). However, few empirical studies have examined this channel of impact in the CCT and emissions context. Costantini et al. (2017) examined several European industrial sectors and reported that sectoral environmental patents, as well as domestic and foreign environmental technology spillovers from vertically related sectors, reduced sectoral emission intensity. Similarly, Ghisetti and Quatraro (2017), Jiao et al. (2018) and Jiao et al. (2020) found that environmental technology spillovers influence environmental and carbon productivity among vertically related sectors in Italy and China. While these studies have indicated that international or interregional environmental technology spillovers can be important in mitigating GHG emissions, we are not aware of studies that have analysed international environmental technology spillovers' effects on country-level emissions. In the energy efficiency context, Sun et al. (2021) found that international technology spillovers improve other countries' energy efficiency. Their analysis used patent data to measure technological innovation directly.Moreover, the second externality produced by environmental technological development, i.e., positive knowledge spillovers that impact other individuals and countries, has received considerably less attention in the literature analysing determinants of GHG emissions.

        <p>Some related studies have examined spillovers' role in general and have analysed their impacts on environmental or carbon productivity and energy intensity. Pan et al. (2020) interpreted outward foreign direct investment (FDI) as technology transfer and found that such transfers improve carbon productivity in Chinese provinces, while Zhou et al. (2019) reported that such technology spillovers make a positive, but very limited impact, on green total factor productivity in China. They also reported that the effects indicate large heterogeneity across provinces. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2021) examined Chinese provinces and found that international R&amp;D spillovers influence environmental productivity. Pan et al. (2021) found that interregional technology spillovers reduce energy intensity in China, but that the effects depend on absorptive capacity. Similarly, Balsalobre-Lorente et al. (2022a) found that FDI dampens energy use, which indicates potential technology transfer. However, Cui et al. (2022) and Lv et al. (2021) reported mixed environmental impacts from FDI and trade openness among OECD countries and China.Some related studies have examined spillovers' role in general and have analysed their impacts on environmental or carbon productivity and energy intensity.

        <p>Beyond the (aggregate) economy-level investigation of environmental-related R&amp;D's role in carbon emissions, related sectoral perspective studies can be found in the literature (Jiao et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2021;Jiang et al., 2022;Kassouri and Alola, 2023). For instance, Yang et al. (2021) implemented an approach that combines geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) and STIRPAT models to investigate how CO2 emissions are impacted across six sectors in China during the 2000-2017 period. Three aspects of technology spillovers were considered in the investigation, i.e., spillovers from international technology arising from FDI inflow, inter-provincial technology spillovers and domestic R&amp;D investment. The investigation's results indicated that R&amp;D investment hinders carbon emissions from the wholesale, industrial and agricultural sectors, but triggers carbon emissions across the residential, construction and transportation sectors. Furthermore, with the exception of the transportation sector, international technology spillovers arising from FDI worsen carbon emissions across the sectors. Moreover, the findings revealed that inter-provincial technology spillovers mitigate carbon emissions from the agricultural, construction and wholesale sectors, but worsen CO2 emissions from the transportation, residential and industrial sectors. In addition to technology-related indicators discussed above, economic (i.e., income) and other socioeconomic (i.e., population) factors also have proven to influence the economic sectors' environmental quality aspects (Chen et al., 2022;Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2022b;Alola et al., 2023).Beyond the (aggregate) economy-level investigation of environmental-related R&amp;D's role in carbon emissions, related sectoral perspective studies can be found in the literature (Jiao et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2021;Jiang et al., 2022;Kassouri and Alola, 2023).

        <p>To sum up, most of the aforementioned studies analysed overall FDI impacts and largely failed to provide a clear distinction between environmental and nonenvironmental R&amp;D. Moreover, the spillovers from different climate change technologies also have not been examined from sectoral perspectives. Considering this obvious literature gap, the present study contributes to the literature by examining the critical drivers of energy and industrial sector emissions given climate change technologies' development domestically and international spillovers alongside economic and socioeconomic factors.To sum up, most of the aforementioned studies analysed overall FDI impacts and largely failed to provide a clear distinction between environmental and nonenvironmental R&amp;D.

        <p>Climate change technology was measured using patent data, which was retrieved from the OECD's REGPAT database. Consequently, two distinct computations were made for domestic climate change technology stock (CC), which captures a country's climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies, and climate change technology spillover stock (SCC), which accounts for diffusion of climate change-related technologies from other countries to a country in question. Climate change patents were counted as the number of patent applications in technology classes Y02E and Y02P based on patent applications filed with the European Patent Office (EPO) (Angelucci et al., 2018). 3 Class Y02E comprises energy generation-, transmission-and distributionrelated CC technologies, i.e., technologies related to the energy sector, and Y02P comprises CC technologies related to the production and processing of goods, i.e., technologies related to the industrial sector. Following prior studies, we relied on patent applications filed at the EPO, thereby avoiding problems tied to differing patent regimes in various countries and because Nordic countries are EPO members. Patents are allocated to countries based on the inventor's resident country. In the case of multiple inventors from several countries, fractional counting was applied to avoid double counting of patents.Climate change technology was measured using patent data, which was retrieved from the OECD's REGPAT database.

Climate change patents were counted as the number of patent applications in technology classes Y02E and Y02P based on patent applications filed with the European Patent Office (EPO) (Angelucci et al., 2018). 3 Class Y02E comprises energy generation-, transmission-and distributionrelated CC technologies, i.e., technologies related to the energy sector, and Y02P comprises CC technologies related to the production and processing of goods, i.e., technologies related to the industrial sector. Following prior studies, we relied on patent applications filed at the EPO, thereby avoiding problems tied to differing patent regimes in various countries and because Nordic countries are EPO members. Patents are allocated to countries based on the inventor's resident country.

        <p>Given that new technologies are expected to exert an effect over a longer period, the accumulated CC patent stocks using the annual patent counts were constructed.

EPO patent data are available as early as 1978; thus, we did not estimate starting values separately, as our estimation period begins in 1990. Moreover, climate change-related technologies' spillovers also were calculated. As technological innovations in one country diffuse over national borders, they create technology spillovers, which are expected to benefit countries beyond the country of origin. The computation of technology spillovers could be performed through a weighted (by imports, FDI or distance) or unweighted approach. Previous studies have indicated that knowledge spillovers occur between regions and countries situated near each other, and that spillover probability diminishes as distance increases. Thus, following prior studies (e.g., Costantini et al., 2013;Grafström, 2018), we adopted the distance-weighted approach. The distance-weighted spillover stocks for energy sectorand industrial sector-related climate change technologies, i.e., DSCCE and DSCCI, are computed as follows:in which CI and CE are the number of patent applications in year t in country i in industrial activity-and energy-related technologies, and CCI and CCE are the respective accumulated stocks. δ is the depreciation rate, which is set at 15 % (Hall et al., 2010).

        <p>These variables' common statistics for each country and the correlation statistics are presented in Tables 1 and2, respectively. As observed in Table 1, the countries exhibited similar statistical properties across the data set. Clearly, and as presented visually in Fig. 3, GHG emission volume from the energy sector was significantly larger than from the industrial sector in all the countries and the overall panel. A similar pattern occurred with domestic CC technological development and foreign technology spillovers, in which climate change technologies in the energy sector were more abundant than in the industrial sector (see Figs. 1 and2). Specifically, as depicted in Fig. 1, the disparity in energy and industrial domestic climate change technologies is more significant in Denmark. Moreover, the statistical evidence indicates that CCE, CCI, DSCCE and DSCCI are correlated negatively with EGHG and IGHG (see Table 2). While a negative correlation was found between EGHG and GDP, a positive correlation was found between IGHG and GDP. Meanwhile, population exhibited a positive association with EGHG, while the correlation between population and IGHG was not statistically significant.These variables' common statistics for each country and the correlation statistics are presented in Tables 1 and2, respectively.

        <p>Given that this study examined economic growth's effects alongside domestic and foreign development of climate change technologies on energy and industrial sector GHG emissions, the investigation was designed to follow the empirical literature on the EKC hypothesis and STIRPAT model. The EKC hypothesises an inverted U-shaped connection between environmental indicators and income. Meanwhile, human impact on the environment is represented as a function of population, affluence and technology in a STIRPAT model (Dietz and Rosa, 1994;York et al., 2003).Given that this study examined economic growth's effects alongside domestic and foreign development of climate change technologies on energy and industrial sector GHG emissions, the investigation was designed to follow the empirical literature on the EKC hypothesis and STIRPAT model.

        <p>Given that this was a panel investigation, several preliminary tests were conducted ahead of the coefficient estimation. First, tests were conducted to investigate cross-sectional dependence (CSD) in the panel, i.e., for each variable and proposed model. This aimed to ascertain whether changes in macroeconomic, economic and/or socioeconomic factors in one country can impact those in another country. Therefore, a variable-wise CSD test was conducted following Pesaran (2021), and the results suggested the presence of CSD. In the models, the combination of the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier Test (Breusch and Pagan, 1980) and Pesaran Scaled Lagrange Multiplier Test (Pesaran, 2021) also provided evidence of CSD in the outlined models. Given the evidence of CSD in Table 3, a stationarity test was conducted, with the results indicating that the variables were all stationary at most after first difference. Two distinct approaches to stationarity testsi.e., Pesaran (2007), which accounted for CSD, and Levin et al. (2002) were conducted, and the results are documented in Table A (appendix). However, Pedroni's (1999) cointegration test and Pesaran and Yamagata's (2008) slope homogeneity test provided evidence of cointegration (see Table 4). Meanwhile, as indicated in Table 5, slope homogeneity was rejected for the energy model, but the test failed to reject the null hypothesis for the industrial model.Given that this was a panel investigation, several preliminary tests were conducted ahead of the coefficient estimation.

        <p>Concerning coefficient estimations, the appropriateness of Pooled Mean Group (PMG) autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) by Pesaran et al. (1999) is relied upon for the long run and short run. The choice of PMG was guided by its suitability to estimate coefficients with crosssectional short-run heterogeneity and long-run homogeneity. Furthermore, the PMG-ARDL approach was deployed, given the mixed evidence of slope homogeneity, as the two models in Table 5 indicate. Finally, the aforementioned technique is effective at providing short-and long-run coefficient estimates. Given that the step-by-step procedure is documented widely in the literature, details on the process are excluded here for space considerations. However, a robustness investigation was conducted to ascertain Granger causality direction among the variables in the panel. Specifically, the recently developed Granger noncausality approach by Juodis et al. (2021) was employed. For the aforementioned empirical approaches, the step-by-step descriptions were not documented here to avoid unnecessary replication and because of space constraints.Concerning coefficient estimations, the appropriateness of Pooled Mean Group (PMG) autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) by Pesaran et al.

        <p>The model for the industrial sector GHG emissions is slightly different, particularly from the perspective of the economic growth and GHG emission nexus (see the right-hand side of Table 6). Specifically, it is surprising that the EKC hypothesis was not valid. Instead, a U-shaped hypothesis was established in both the short and long runs, thereby indicating no evidence that economic growth improves environmental quality. Specifically, increases in economic activity initially continued to mitigate industrial sector GHG emissions until emissions were reduced to a certain minimum level, after which the sector's GHG emissions surged in the long run. Meanwhile, for the separate models with domestic and spillover environmental technologies, population increases played a desirable environmental role.The model for the industrial sector GHG emissions is slightly different, particularly from the perspective of the economic growth and GHG emission nexus (see the right-hand side of Table 6).

        <p>Notably, locally produced environmental technologies and environmental technologies' spillovers mitigated GHG emissions from the industrial sector in the panel. However, unlike the energy sector, locally produced environmental technologies reduced industrial sector GHG emissions by almost twice as much as environmental technologies' spillovers in the long run. Domestic environmental technologies' impact on GHG emissions is also clearly higher in the industrial sector than in the energy sector. This finding also is in line with Erdogan et al. (2020), who found that innovations reduced emissions from the industrial sector, but not from the energy sector. The evidence from this investigation also partly aligns with the literature indicating that technology spillovers exert significant effects on emissions. However, Sun et al. (2021) demonstrated that international spillovers make a greater impact on energy efficiency than domestic innovations. Moreover, on the sectoral level, Costantini et al. (2013) and Jiao et al. (2020) also indicated that technological spillovers exert a greater impact on environmental performance than technological development, contradicting both energy and industrial sector results in Table 6. Spillovers' lesser importance in our aggregate-level results can be due to differences in countries' industrial structures, implying that not all foreign developed technologies are technologically relevant and applicable to domestic industrial activities, thereby limiting the potential to benefit from international technology spillovers. Another interpretation of these differences is that domestic inventive activities are particularly important in the industrial sector, but less so in the energy sector.

        <p>Although the cross section under investigation was small (a panel of four countries), the Granger noncausality approach by Juodis et al. (2021) was found to be most suitable for the robustness analysis, considering its suitability for homogeneous or heterogeneous coefficients. Given the results presented in Table 7, significant evidence indicates that all the variables, with the exception of population, exerted a significantly negative impact on energy sector GHG emissions, i.e., these Granger variables caused energy sector GHG emissions from the Nordic states, in line with the results from the PMG-ARDL approach. Similarly, the Granger causality results from industrial sector GHG emissions supported the PMG-ARDL approach. Specifically, GDP and the square of GDP Granger elicited industrial sector GHG emissions with positive coefficients. Furthermore, locally produced environmental technologies and environmental technologies' spillovers from foreign states also Granger cause industrial sector GHG emissions, but with negative coefficients. Overall, the results from Juodis et al.'s (2021) approach largely supported the PMG-ARDL results, thereby indicating significant robustness.Although the cross section under investigation was small (a panel of four countries), the Granger noncausality approach by Juodis et al.

        <p>In the present investigation, the drivers of energy and industrial sector GHG emissions were examined through a panel of small open economies in the Nordic region (i.e., Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) from the 1990-2019 period. As such, environmental technologies' roles through the domestic development of climate change technologies and spillovers from foreign climate change technology development were considered. Furthermore, the contributions of population and economic growth were also investigated.

This is a positive finding, particularly as the energy sector accounts for the lion's share of total GHG emissions.

        <p>As both domestic environmental technological development and international technology spillovers have been demonstrated to reduce sectoral GHG emissions, national R&amp;D and climate policies need to incorporate both aspects. R&amp;D-related policies should be conceived from the perspective that environmental technological development has the potential to drive both economic and environmental benefits, thereby justifying wider policy interventions towards environmental R&amp;D investments. Beyond considering wider policy interventions, environment-related measures, particularly for domestic and internationally imported technologies, should reflect the elements of the Nordics' nationally determined contributions (NDCs) significantly. Furthermore, because international technology spillovers appear to be an important mechanism for emission reductions, public policies should support international technology and R&amp;D collaboration. Furthermore, to utilise foreign knowledge spillovers, countries' absorptive capacity could also be improved through further human capital development and technology investment programmes. Differences in absorptive capacity also may explain why technology spillovers' importance appears to vary across sectors and countries, but further research is needed to clarify this. However, further research is also needed to pinpoint the exact channels of foreign spillovers and to enable more targeted policy responses to support international climate change technology diffusion. The identified international technology spillovers could also backfire and provide countries with incentives for free-riding, which could lead to suboptimal environmental R&amp;D investments globally. Thus, international coordination of climate change technology subsidies and support policies is also warranted.As both domestic environmental technological development and international technology spillovers have been demonstrated to reduce sectoral GHG emissions, national R&amp;D and climate policies need to incorporate both aspects.

        <p>Considering the evidence of a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and GHG emissions, particularly in the industrial sector, the results suggest that adoption of green economic and environmentally friendly practices in the sector is highly deficient. To improve the industrial sector in this regard, more stringent environmental policies that promote resource productivity, resource reuse and circularity, and green and clean content development should be promoted further. Specifically, such stringent environmental policy should span the sector's value chain, from the manufacturing and distribution of capital goods, to end-users' information through product labels. Furthermore, as domestic technology development's emission-reducing effects are highlighted in particular, the industrial sector's environmental performance in the Nordic countries will benefit from more investment in environmental R&amp;D through more public-private partnerships that further encourage development of environmental technologies and innovations. Moreover, green entrepreneurial activities through increased access to credit facilities and relevant environmental sustainability trainings should be encouraged across economic sectors.Considering the evidence of a U-shaped relationship between economic growth and GHG emissions, particularly in the industrial sector, the results suggest that adoption of green economic and environmentally friendly practices in the sector is highly deficient.

        <p>A future study could extend the scope to GHG emissions from other sectors to provide a more holistic approach to achieving environmental and climate sustainability. Aside from a comprehensive sector-wide analysis, given data availability, future studies also could include intra-sector analysis. This approach should help channel organisations' green management approaches further, thereby providing a pathway for micro-to macro-level climate sustainability and a green economy. While climate change technologies' spillovers were measured via a distanceweighted approach, we do not argue that geographical closeness is the only mechanism for technology diffusion. Thus, future studies also could consider other technology spillover channels.
