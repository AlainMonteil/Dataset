        <p>This paper reviews some of these new innovations in both the macroporous substrate and the microporous layer (MPL). A diverse range of macroporous substrates and designs is shown, encompassing various carbon-based and metal-based materials and innovative fabrication methodologies. A critical assessment of innovative MPL materials and designs for performance improvements is presented, taking into account pore size distribution and microstructure. An analysis of the effect of wettability and hydrophobic agents in the substrate and MPL is performed. One of the notable findings is that, among other key findings, significant performance enhancement is realised through employing graduated porosity and/or wettability GDLs. Finally, recommendations for future work into GDL materials and designs are made, with the aim of ultimately improving the overall cell efficiency.This paper reviews some of these new innovations in both the macroporous substrate and the microporous layer (MPL).

        <p>Recently, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have received a significant amount of attention due to their high-power density, fast start-up time and zero/low emissions; as such they are regarded as a sustainable solution for a wide range of stationary, portable and vehicular applications. PEMFCs are electrochemical energy conversion devices, whereby hydrogen fuel is indirectly reacted with oxygen to produce water, electricity and heat. Hydrogen is oxidised in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anodic side of the fuel to protons (or hydrogen ions) and oxygen is reduced in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with protons (migrating from the anode side) at the cathodic side of the cell. The ORR kinetics are much slower than the hydrogen oxidation reaction; therefore, more platinum catalyst is normally used at the cathodic side to increase its rate of the reaction.Recently, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have received a significant amount of attention due to their high-power density, fast start-up time and zero/low emissions; as such they are regarded as a sustainable solution for a wide range of stationary, portable and vehicular applications.

        <p>The gas diffusion layer (GDL) of PEMFC is placed between the catalyst and current collector on each side of the fuel cell, thus it is an essential performance-limiting component of the PEMFC. The GDL has multiple important roles within the PEMFC. First, it provides electrical connection between the electrocatalyst layers and the bipolar plates (and thereby the external circuit). Therefore, it should have high electronic conductivity. The GDL also conducts exothermically generated heat away from the electrocatalyst layer and should therefore have high thermal conductivity. It provides mechanical support to the fragile electrocatalyst layer during PEMFC assembly and operation, and therefore should demonstrate high mechanical stability. Most importantly, the GDL provides transport pathways for the supply of reactant gases (e.g. hydrogen at the anode and air (or oxygen) at the cathode) from the flow channels to the electrocatalyst layers. As such, the GDL should have suitable mass transport properties. Finally, the GDL facilitates the removal of excess liquid water produced at the cathode to the exhaust stream, and thus it should have suitable wettability [1]. Single-layer GDLs consist solely of a macroporous substrate (MPS). However, typical GDLs used in PEMFCs are dual layer, in which the MPS is coated with a microporous layer (MPL).The gas diffusion layer (GDL) of PEMFC is placed between the catalyst and current collector on each side of the fuel cell, thus it is an essential performance-limiting component of the PEMFC.

        <p>By supplying the reactants and removing the products, the GDL can significantly affect catalyst utilisation. Inefficiencies in the GDL structure which lead to lower voltages in the PEMFC current-voltage plots (or polarisation curves) can be classed as either ohmic losses, or mass transport losses. Ohmic losses are essentially related to the resistance of the GDL and its interfaces with the electrocatalyst layer and the bipolar plate. Meanwhile, mass transport losses (also known as concentration losses) can be separated into two main contributions. First is the rate at which reactants can be supplied to the electrocatalyst layer. This must occur at a faster rate than that at which they are consumed, or a voltage drop will be observed, especially at high current density. Secondly, liquid water produced in the cathode electrocatalyst layer must be removed efficiently in order to prevent "flooding". This normally occurs at high current densities (e.g. ≥ 1 A cm -2 ) [2], where liquid water is generated faster than it can be removed, causing it to accumulate. This water then blocks oxygen transport to the electrocatalyst layer, causing a voltage drop in the polarisation curves. Ohmic losses and mass transport losses must be minimised in order to enhance PEMFC performance.By supplying the reactants and removing the products, the GDL can significantly affect catalyst utilisation.

        <p>In order to minimise ohmic losses, the electronic conductivity of materials must be high. This is usually dictated by the material properties. To minimise mass transport losses, the pore size distribution must be suitable. This is usually dictated by the microstructure. As such, carbon is generally selected as a material for the GDL due to its high electronic conductivity and the wide range of possible microstructures. In addition carbon-based materials can have high thermal conductivity, high strength, good thermal stability, and reasonable oxidative stability [3].In order to minimise ohmic losses, the electronic conductivity of materials must be high.

        <p>Over the last decade, a large body of work has focussed on the characterisation of commercially developed GDLs and the factors that affect the transport properties. Increasingly, structural modifications, innovative designs, and alternative materials are being developed. With the potential to improve the PEMFC activity, durability or lower cost. Previous review papers have summarised the existing problems with gas diffusion layers and the progress made with their design improvements [3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Cindrella et al. [4] present a detailed background to the characteristics of the GDL with particular attention to the influence of these on water management in the PEMFC. Park et al. [3], presented a thorough review of the materials and designs of the GDL where analysis of the hydrophobic treatment of the GDL was examined as well as the materials used for the carbon framework of the substrate and the MPL. Like [4] although well researched this review omits more recent developments made in the field. Arvray [5] and Ozden [7] give a comprehensive review of the experimental methods used to characterise the GDL; these papers are a solid starting point to understand GDL; in terms of physical structure and the transport mechanisms underpinning gas diffusion layer diffusion layer designs.

        <p>The macroporous substrate is usually the primarily component of a GDL. Carbon fibres sheets are generally used for the MPS, due to their high gas permeability, impressive strength and elasticity under compression, corrosion resistance in acidic environment, and excellent electrical conductivity [3]. They are typically formed from extruded polymer fibres such as polyaniline, which are graphitized at high temperature (i.e. &lt; 2000 • C). The individual carbon fibres formed through this process generally have diameters of 5-10 μm, and the orientation of these depends on the manufacturing process [7].The macroporous substrate is usually the primarily component of a GDL.

        <p>The most common types of carbon fibre sheets used in GDLs are carbon cloth, carbon paper, or carbon felt. Carbon cloth typically comprises interlocking bundles of carbon fibre woven together with a regular structure (Fig. 1a). In carbon paper, the fibres are rigid, straight and randomly oriented (Fig. 1b). As such, they are generally less porous compared to carbon cloth [10] and because the fibres are preferentially orientated in-plane, the microstructure is highly anisotropic. This impacts the gas transport properties, the thermal conductivity, and the electrical conductivity [11].

        <p>Carbon fibre sheet porosity is normally in the range of 70-90%, and the density can vary from between 0.2 and 0.75 g/cm 3 , whilst the substrate thickness can vary between e.g. 100 and 500 μm [12]. The thickness, porous structure and structural anisotropy of the carbon fibres all influence the two-phase transport properties of the resulting GDL (i.e. how the reactant gases and liquid water pass through the layer) [13,14]. However, there is a trade-off between the gas transport properties and the electronic conductivity in GDLs, since electrons are conducted through the solid, non-porous phase of the carbon fibre sheet. As such, the structure of the substrates should be optimised to ensure adequate mass transport and sufficient electrical conductivity.Carbon fibre sheet porosity is normally in the range of 70-90%, and the density can vary from between 0.2 and 0.75 g/cm 3 , whilst the substrate thickness can vary between e.g. 100 and 500 μm [12].

        <p>The porosity is a key factor in determining the fuel cell performance of a particular GDL. Macropores are defined as pores being over 5 μm in diameter, mesopores are defined as being between 0.07 μm and 5 μm in diameter, and micropores are defined as being less than 0.07 μm (70 nm) in diameter. In electrochemical systems, macropores are generally considered to be hydrophobic, functioning as gas transport pathways.The porosity is a key factor in determining the fuel cell performance of a particular GDL.

        <p>Mesopores are considered to be both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, aiding both gas diffusion and liquid water transport. Finally, micropores are considered to be hydrophobic, helping to condense water vapour to liquid, which can subsequently be transported out of the cell [15]. The MPS is largely a macroporous component of the GDL, with larger pores designed to aid mass transport. Fig. 2 shows the representative pore size distribution of three different GDLs, as obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) which highlights the distribution of macropores [16].Mesopores are considered to be both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, aiding both gas diffusion and liquid water transport.

        <p>A wide range of macropore diamters is observed, with prominent peaks at ~80 nm, ~1 μm, and ~40-70 μm. Each GDL has markedly different pore size distribution depending on the structure, as highlighted in Fig. 2b. Our understanding of the ability of the substrate to transport mass, conduct electrons and transfer heat in conventional GDLs has been improved by extensive characterisation in a large number of studies. This has helped to inform the choice of substrate materials, and how their fabrication and design impacts the final properties of the GDL in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell. Key areas of improvement in GDL design are based around optimising the porosity, changing the surface properties, and improving the electrical conductivity. Recently in-situ imaging is emerging as a promising field to understand the performance of GDLs. For example, Fig. 3 shows in-operando images of liquid water at the cathode, obtained via x-ray computed tomography. This type of technique has provided significant insights into the state of liquid water and reactant gases, during operation [17][18][19], and this will enable further development of optimised pore structures for GDLs.A wide range of macropore diamters is observed, with prominent peaks at ~80 nm, ~1 μm, and ~40-70 μm.

        <p>Electrospinning is a recent manufacturing technique (from 2012) used for the production of continuous fibres of sub-micron to nanometer scale [20]. From adjustment of the parameters during the spinning process, it is possible to control the fibre diameter, pore size, fibre alignment and surface properties of a material. In essence, it is possible to fabricate a macroporous substrate, or e-GDL with an optimised microstructure for mass transport and for the management of liquid water. To this end, electrospinning has been used by several researchers to optimise GDL design in terms of: pore size [21][22][23][24][25], and hydrophobicity [23].Electrospinning is a recent manufacturing technique (from 2012) used for the production of continuous fibres of sub-micron to nanometer scale [20].

        <p>Chevalier et al. [25] conducted a comprehensive study into the optimisation of electrospun MPS, where various parameters were altered including fibre length, fibre diameter, wettability and fibre orientation. The eGDLs were then characterised in-situ and ex-situ; they reported that the e-GDL with the smallest fibre diameter (0.20 μm compared to 1.13 μm) had a smallest inter-fibre space and therefore smallest pore size, which promoted thus improved liquid water removal and decreased mass transport resistance. This resulted in an increased power density than the thicker fibre e-GDL (501 versus 275 mW cm 2 ). The wettability and the fibre alignment also had a significant effect on the MEA performance, increasing the maximum power density by 12%.Chevalier et al.

        <p>Ren et al. [23] attempted optimisation of the electrospun GDL for use in self-humidifying PEMFCs by modification of the production parameters, including concentration of the polymer solution and the fibre diameter. They reported that their e-GDL had greater water retention capabilities and therefore was suitable for low humidity conditions by alleviating membrane dehydration. However, electrochemical and polarisation curves were not performed and as such the full conclusion of the capability of the e-GDL in a PEMFC has yet to be confirmed. Certain challenges need to be overcome to improve e-GDL durability as Balakrishnan et al. [26] reported a notable drop in contact angle (from 136 • to 44 • ) after accelerated stress tests in hydrogen peroxide due to a degradation of the fluorinated monolayers. Polarisation curves indicated that the degraded electrospun GDL suffered higher levels of liquid water accumulation and mass transport losses than the pristine with a significant potential drop voltage following the 0.5 A cm -2 . The importance of durability tests, which are often neglected, should not be underestimated as they are as important as the performance tests (e.g. the peak power density or the limiting current density).Ren et al.

        <p>Attempts to improve the water management capabilities of the GDL have resulted in various modifications to the design of the macroporous substrate, one of which is the perforation of the cathode MPS [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]. Different methods have been used to create large holes (relative to the pore size of the substrate) in the cathode MPS substrate with the aim of creating pathways to divert liquid water from the pores of the cathode diffusion media and the catalyst layer to the gas flow channel, thus relieving the porous media of the cathode side from liquid water saturation and enabling mass transport.Attempts to improve the water management capabilities of the GDL have resulted in various modifications to the design of the macroporous substrate, one of which is the perforation of the cathode MPS [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35].

        <p>Various techniques have been employed to create a pathway for excess water including manual micro-drilling [32], electric discharge machining [32], and laser perforation [27][28][29][30][33][34][35]. Laser perforation has been used the most extensively though researchers noted that it (and also electric discharge machining) resulted in the formation hydrophilic holes due to the removal of PTFE material from the surrounding area [30,32,34,35]. When using laser perforation to enhance water management it is essential that perforation diameter is optimised as other it may result in power loss.Various techniques have been employed to create a pathway for excess water including manual micro-drilling [32], electric discharge machining [32], and laser perforation [27][28][29][30][33][34][35].

        <p>Gersteisen et al. [28,29] extensively researched the effect of MPS perforations on liquid water transport and on MEA performance. In their initial study they produced 80 μm holes by laser perforation in a Toray TGP-H-090 MPS; this was reported to have enhanced PEMFC performance where limiting current density was increased by 22% [28]. Polarisation curves performed identified less mass transport losses with the perforated macroporous substrate indicating reduced accumulation of liquid water with this MPS. Scale-up from a single cell to a PEMFC stack showed the viability of their design for real world applications [29]. This is a crucial but often neglected step by researchers as the GDL designs and modifications are not extended beyond the single cell stage.Gersteisen et al.

        <p>The imaging of the MEA through E-SEM [34], in-operando synchrotron X-ray radiography [30,35], and synchrotron tomography [30] has helped with the validation of this research and provided clarity on the effect of these modifications on the liquid water front. Haussman et al. [30] used synchrotron X-ray radiography and tomography to reveal the preferred water transport pathways in the perforated GDL; the optimal dimeter of the holes (60 μm) was attributed to the different filling behaviour of the pores. Numerical studies performed by Fang et al. [27] and Niu [31] supported the experimental work on the topic and aided in design optimisation. Niu et al. [31] modelled two phase fluid flow using the two-phase volume of fluid (VOF) model in a reconstruction of the perforated GDL where the diameter, depth and the location of the perforations were assessed. Their oxygen diffusion models supported the experimental data in that MPS perforation increases oxygen concentration and reduces oxygen transport resistance in the GDL. Their model, compared to the case with no perforations, predicted an increase of more than 100% in oxygen concentration with 100 μm perforations. However holes of a smaller diameter (e.g. 25 μm) was found to have negligible effects on the water saturation. This in agreement with the optimisation experimental data from Manahan et al. [36] who reported a 25% increase in power density with an MPS with 100 μm perforations and almost negligible improvements with much smaller perforations [28,30]. They [36] also reported that the perforation location far from the GDL centre and at the liquid water break-through point was more effective at reducing liquid water saturation. Experimental work on MPS perforation has fallen out of trend recently; however, the recreation of this study experimentally with water visualisation, i.e. by employing synchrotron X-ray radiography or X-ray computer tomography, would prove beneficial in terms of optimisation of the GDL design.The imaging of the MEA through E-SEM [34], in-operando synchrotron X-ray radiography [30,35], and synchrotron tomography [30] has helped with the validation of this research and provided clarity on the effect of these modifications on the liquid water front.

[31] modelled two phase fluid flow using the two-phase volume of fluid (VOF) model in a reconstruction of the perforated GDL where the diameter, depth and the location of the perforations were assessed. Their oxygen diffusion models supported the experimental data in that MPS perforation increases oxygen concentration and reduces oxygen transport resistance in the GDL. Their model, compared to the case with no perforations, predicted an increase of more than 100% in oxygen concentration with 100 μm perforations. However holes of a smaller diameter (e.g. 25 μm) was found to have negligible effects on the water saturation. This in agreement with the optimisation experimental data from Manahan et al. [36] who reported a 25% increase in power density with an MPS with 100 μm perforations and almost negligible improvements with much smaller perforations [28,30]. They [36] also reported that the perforation location far from the GDL centre and at the liquid water break-through point was more effective at reducing liquid water saturation. Experimental work on MPS perforation has fallen out of trend recently; however, the recreation of this study experimentally with water visualisation, i.e. by employing synchrotron X-ray radiography or X-ray computer tomography, would prove beneficial in terms of optimisation of the GDL design.</p>

        <p>Another innovation by Gurau et al. [38] used flexible graphite sheets produced from expanded graphite flakes. These were perforated to produce a flexible, macroporous graphite-based MPS, with high electrical and thermal conductivity, and low contact resistance compared to a conventional carbon fibre GDL. The perforation densities of up to 10, 000 holes per 6.5 cm 2 and porosities of between 0.05% and 35% could be varied simply by altering the tooling geometry, thus optimising the porosity and pore size distribution for PEMFC operation. Larger porosity and lower density of perforations were reported to result in the highest power densities. Whilst this is an interesting concept, providing an easy way to introduce macropores into arbitrary substrates, the results were not compared with conventional GDLs, making it difficult to assess the usefulness of this innovation.Another innovation by Gurau et al.

        <p>Carbon nanotubes are useful materials for use in GDLs due to their large aspect ratio, excellent electrical conductivity (10 6 -10 7 S cm -2 ), high thermal conductivity, and high strength/stiffness (&gt;100 GPa and 1.2 TPa, respectively) [39][40][41][42][43]. The large aspect ratio of carbon nanotubes means that they can form free-standing membranes (known as buckypaper), without the need for a binder. Many research groups have explored carbon nanotubes as electrode materials in PEMFCs, but this has been largely limited to the electrocatalyst layer and the microporous layers [44][45][46]. A smaller amount of research has been conducted into the fabrication of carbon nanotube based MPSs.Carbon nanotubes are useful materials for use in GDLs due to their large aspect ratio, excellent electrical conductivity (10 6 -10 7 S cm -2 ), high thermal conductivity, and high strength/stiffness (&gt;100 GPa and 1.2 TPa, respectively) [39][40][41][42][43].

        <p>For example, Tang et al. [44] produced a porous buckypaper via vacuum filtration of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and applied this as a gas diffusion electrode in PEMFCs, in comparison with conventional carbon cloth (ELAT®). Although innovative in design, the buckypaper resulted in much lower membrane electrode assembly (MEA) performance (despite being much thinner), and the polarisation curve exhibited significant fluctuation. This may be partly due to the much smaller pore size in SWCNTs (i.e. nanometer scale), compared the macroporous structure of conventional gas diffusion electrodes. However, the polarisation curve suggests that the activation region and the ohmic region are responsible for most of the voltage drops. This suggests that the SWCNT layer negatively affects catalyst utilisation, and that the contact resistance may be much higher (e.g. due to the lack of interpenetration between the electrocatalyst layer and the gas diffusion electrode).For example, Tang et al.

This poor performance of smaller MWCNTs (~35 mW cm -2 ) was attributed to the broader and uneven pore size distribution, and to the higher electrical resistance compared to the larger MWCNTs. Interestingly, a composite gas diffusion electrode comprising a layer of smaller MWCNTs on top of a layer of larger MWCNTs (referred to as D in Fig. 4) produced the highest power density (110 mW cm -2 ).

However, the porosity, average pore diameter, and water contact angle were comparable. The maximum PEMFC power density achieved was 168 mW cm -2 , compared with 208 mW cm -2 for the Toray carbon paper. They attributed this to the much lower surface area (~15 vs 214 m 2 g -1 ), but due to theclear difference in the ohmic region on the polarisation curve, it likely to be due to the lower electrical conductivity.Other research groups have attempted to reduce the cost of the MPS by fabricating them from more sustainable materials, such as cellulose [49,50], bamboo [51,52], coconut fibres [53,54], and other biomass-derived carbons.

[72] developed a similar porous GDL with improved electrical and thermal conductivity and controlled the porosity using a 12.5 μm thick copper foil with an applied MPL of Vulcan XC-72 (Fig. 10, (left)). Their copper foil substrate had various pore sizes and straight pore profile and when coated measured a contact angle of 152 • . Although the Cu GDL exhibited a lower maximum power density (0.45 W cm -2 ) compared to MPL-coated Toray TGP-H-060 (0.59 W cm -2 ), the achievable controlled permeability, pore shape, porosity, and surface properties of this method allows for tailored design which will lead to improved reactant and product transport. Other research groups have focused on the use of titanium sinters; Liu et al. [73] used titanium sinters as the GDL in a free-breathing PEM fuel cell, nickel meshes, though for the DMFC.Zhang et al.

        <p>3D printing is an interesting and novel method to produce microstructured metal sheets for GDL applications. Jayakumar et al. [74] produced a carbon-free nylon-aluminium substrate using 3D printing technology which was infused with graphene to increase electrical and thermal conductivity; it was then compared to the commercial SGL 39 BC. The fabricated GDL exhibited comparable porosity (42%), good tensile strength (≥4 N cm -1 ), and an excellent thermal conductivity (0.588-0.512 W mK -1 ). However, it was characterised by a high through-plane resistance resulting in a lower conductivity than the Sigracet GDL. This is attributed to the graphene particles being poorly embedded into the substrate which limited the conductivity of the substrate. 3D printing of substrates offers significant potential as a means of producing GDL substrates with tailored microstructure. However, 3D printing as a technology is currently in its early development.3D printing is an interesting and novel method to produce microstructured metal sheets for GDL applications.

        <p>The addition of enhancing materials to the GDL such as natural graphite can significantly improve MEA efficiency with very little alteration to the GDL substrate production process. Moreover, the ease of a simplified production process is key to the reduction of manufacturing costs of the GDL and the fuel cell as a whole, thus will make PEMFC more commercially competitive. The idea of cellulose based GDLs and GDLs produced from abundant sustainable biomass material may reduce cost and provide a truly "green" fuel cell. Despite these aspirations, the power density is uncompetitive with the commercial alternatives; therefore, if they are to see any commercialisation as materials, significant research needs to be undertaken to improve the performance before any work can be done to elevate them from the labscale.The addition of enhancing materials to the GDL such as natural graphite can significantly improve MEA efficiency with very little alteration to the GDL substrate production process.

However, it is the control over pore size and structure that will lead to significant jumps in the improvement of the fuel cell efficiency and durability.

        <p>The macroporous substrate of the GDL is usually wet-proofed, where it is treated with a coating of polyfluroethylene (PTFE or Teflon™) or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) in order to render it more hydrophobic. This helps prevent flooding of the electrodes due to liquid water generated during the oxygen reduction reaction. Optimisation of the PTFE coating is critical: whilst it reduces flooding, numerous papers have reported negative effects on the GDL characteristics [12,[82][83][84][85][86]. For example, PTFE has been shown to affect the microstructure of the GDL by reducing the porosity and altering the pore size distribution [12,87,88], the gas diffusivity [89], and permeability [90,91], as well decreasing the electrical conductivity by increasing the contact resistance [92,93].The macroporous substrate of the GDL is usually wet-proofed, where it is treated with a coating of polyfluroethylene (PTFE or Teflon™) or fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) in order to render it more hydrophobic.

        <p>The effect of PTFE on the morphology and transport properties of the GDL was investigated at length by Zamel et al. [94] who reported that the overall porosity pore volume decreases as the proportion of PTFE increases. Moreover, they hypothesized that the effect of PTFE depends on the initial pore size: the microporous volume did not change for micropores ≤3 μm after PTFE impregnation, whereas significant reduction in the macropore volume was observed for a pore radius ≥5 μm. Whilst some studies have indicated that permeability decreases with increasing PTFE loading, Ismail et al. [90] found that an optimum amount of PTFE (i.e. 5 wt%) had a positive effect on the through-plane permeability (more than 5 wt% decreased the permeability). El-Kharouf et al. [12] reported from ex-situ characterisation studies that PTFE increased the permeability of some GDLs and decreased it in others. Increased permeability was attributed to a reduction in tortuosity, whereas reduced permeability was attributed to loss of pore volume.The effect of PTFE on the morphology and transport properties of the GDL was investigated at length by Zamel et al.

        <p>The influence of PTFE on the thermal conductivity of carbon substrates, either in the in-plane [92,[94][95][96] or through-plane orientation [97][98][99], has also received much attention. Burheim et al. [97] found that an increased amount of PTFE in the GDL results in a slight reduction in the through-plane thermal conductivity. This is in agreement with a model created by Yablecki and Bazylak [100] and Fishman and Bazylak, and attributed to the insulating effect of PTFE (which has much lower thermal conductivity than carbon) preventing fibre-to-fibre contact in the through-plane direction. Meanwhile, in the in-plane orientation, heat transfer occurs directly along the carbon fibres and the in-plane thermal conductivity is largely unaffected by PTFE impregnation (as reported by Sadeghifar et al. [96]), Whereas in the in-plane direction heat is transferred along the fibres, and the addition of PTFE reduces the contact resistance between the fibres and increases conductivity. This was observed by Sadeghifar et al. [96] who used modelling and experimental observations to show that the in-plane thermal conductivity does not decrease with PTFE loading. Electrical conductivity is another important parameter that can be affected by PTFE coating. Zamel et al. [94] modelled the effective electrical conductivity in carbon paper GDLs, but disregarded the effect of PTFE loading. Mathias et al. [2] reported the effect of PTFE loading on the through-plane contact resistance. They found that when the GDL was treated with 3.5% PTFE, the electrical conductivity increased. Meanwhile, Ismail et al. [83] analysed the effect of PTFE loading on the through-plane and in-plane electrical conductivities of the GDL.

        <p>Perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) offer an appealing alternative to PTFE as a hydrophobic coating, as they are thermally and chemically stable and have high hydrophobicity. Moreover, they are liquid in physical form, resulting in easy deposition and high gas permeability when applied to the GDL [101]. In-situ tests show that cell performance is improved when PFPE is used over PTFE, particularly at higher current densities where liquid water saturation and mass transport losses dominate [102,103]. The high surface area and high porosity of carbonaceous materials allows the PFPE to successfully bind the carbon fibres/particles whilst maintaining a degree of contact between them. As shown in Fig. 11, the Perfluoropolyether coating is highly homogenous compared to PTFE, in which webbing is clearly observed between the fibres, detrimentally affecting the porosity.Perfluoropolyethers (PFPEs) offer an appealing alternative to PTFE as a hydrophobic coating, as they are thermally and chemically stable and have high hydrophobicity.

        <p>There are two main types of perfluoropolyethers that have been used as alternatives for PTFE: neutral PFPEs, and functionalised PFPEs. Neutral PFPEs are often used as coating agents and have the benefit of ease of application, where they can be easily adsorbed onto the substrate and cover the surface. Functionalised PFPE form bonds with the substrates via oxygen-containing moieties on the carbonaceous surface. Whilst neutral PFPE can be applied to the GDL relatively easily, carbon fibre functionalised with PFPE offers greater stability due to the covalent bonding rather than physical adsorption. A greater contact angle can also be achieved by the use of functionalised PFPEs [104]. Functionalised PFPEs are obtained from the thermal decomposition of peroxide PFPEs.There are two main types of perfluoropolyethers that have been used as alternatives for PTFE: neutral PFPEs, and functionalised PFPEs.

        <p>The typical structure of a peroxide PFPE is as follows:The typical structure of a peroxide PFPE is as follows:</p>
        <p>where T and T ′ are trifluoromethyl (-CF 3 ), and acyl fluoride (e.g. -C(O)F or -CF 2 C(O)F) terminal groups [102]. The thermal decomposition of peroxide PFPEs breaks the peroxide moieties, generating oxygen-centred radicals. These oxygen radicals then decompose into carbon-centred radicals which can link to unsaturated structures without a hydrogenated spacer, such as the carbon fibre surface in the GDL, thus creating a stable binder. This is the reason for the larger contact angle that can be achieved with linked PFPEs. The chemical linkage of PFPE with the carbon fibre can be up to 1% wt.; corresponding to near complete surface coverage (&gt;95%). The main drawback of this method is that it requires exclusively fluorinated solvents and the process of application requires heat treatment. As such the process is more complicated than when functionalised PFPEs are used. When heated, a portion of the functionalised perfluoropolyethers bonds to the carbon substrate, and the remainder flows across the surface [104]. Two commonly used functionalised PFPEs, namely Fluorolink P56 and Fluorolink TLS, have been explored in GDLs. Stampino et al. [103] investigated commercial carbon cloth GDLs in different PFPE dispersions. They found that at high relative humidity (80-100%) and current density, PFPE with lower molecular weight (i.e. P56) outperformed the higher molecular weight PFPE (i.e. TLS), due to improved water management (and thus enhanced mass diffusion), as confirmed by impedance spectroscopy. Both materials have similar contact angle (147 • and 141 • ), so this was not a major factor in the difference in performance. SEM imaging revealed that P56 was able to bind individual fibres without significantly modifying the GDL microstructure [103]. Gola et al. [105] treated GDLs with the PFPE peroxide Fomblin®, followed by thermal treatment. The contact angle was much higher (171 • ) compared to the case of PTFE (148 • ). SEM images revealed webbing between fibres in the case of PTFE, but in the case of PFPE the coating was uniform, leading to improved porosity and the mass transport. Moreover, they reported that replacing a 10 wt% PTFE-based GDL with a 1 wt% PFPE-based GDL improved the fuel cell current density by ~20% as can be seen in Fig. 12.where T and T ′ are trifluoromethyl (-CF 3 ), and acyl fluoride (e.g. -C(O)F or -CF 2 C(O)F) terminal groups [102].

        <p>PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) has also been considered as a viable alternative to PTFE due to its high chemical stability, thermal resistance, and hydrophobic properties. For example, Cabasso et al. [106] fabricated a GDL with controlled pore size and porosity by using phase inversion of PVDF and carbon blends. PVDF was shown to be a much better binder for carbon black particles than PTFE, providing a suitable support for the electrode. The improvement was attributed to the insolubility of PTFE, resulting in inhomogeneous dispersions and thus non-uniform binding of the carbon particles. The majority of research involving PVDF has been limited to the MPL and the catalyst layer, rather than the GDL.PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) has also been considered as a viable alternative to PTFE due to its high chemical stability, thermal resistance, and hydrophobic properties.

The measured power density was much greater than for the 10% PTFE treated GDL (0.03 W cm -2 and 0.0175 W cm -2 , respectively), although the contact angle and through-plane resistance was similar. This was attributed to improved water management and enhanced mass diffusion, since plasma treatment does not hinder the gas transfer pathways in the way that adding a polymer bonder (i.e. PTFE) does.Various research groups have investigated how to promote hydrophobicity with materials which are dissimilar to PTFE.

Joo et al. [110] produced a superhydrophobic cathode GDL via chemical vapour deposition of polydimethylsiloxane on a carbon paper substrate, increasing the water contact angle from 134 to 150 • on the macroporous side (Fig. 13 (left)). However, on the MPL-coated surface the water contact angle was not significantly improved. Despite this, the Si-C coating did lead to improved power output of the received SGL 10BC from 0.30 W cm -2 to 0.40 W cm -2 . From this we can deduce that improving the non-catalyst facing side of the cathode will improve PEMFC efficiency by maintaining the flow gradient of liquid water.Silicone materials have also been used successfully to render the carbon substrate superhydrophobic.

Later, they applied this same method to an uncoated SGL 10AA, to use as a GDL [112]. The contact angle increased from 135 • to 145 • , and the membrane electrode assembly current density was improved. The contact angle was not significantly changed compared to PTFE, and the electrical resistivity was lower, however, the results were not compared with the SGL 10AA substrates treated with 5% PTFE, so a fair comparison could not be made. Chemical reduction of salts with hydrophobic groups has also been investigated. Thomas et al.

        <p>The microporous layer is applied to the gas diffusion layer where it is located between the carbon substrate and the electrocatalyst layer [114]. Carbon black is conventionally used as the main component of the MPL, providing excellent contact between the electrocatalyst layer and the macroporous substrate. Carbon black has a wide application in electrochemistry due to its good physical properties such as: a high electrically conductive, porous material with a large surface area, as well as its low cost and relative abundance [115]. It is derived from the incomplete combustion of heavy hydrocarbon products from the petroleum industry, such as coal tar and ethylene cracking tar. Carbon black is subcategorised depending of its production process which determines its physical properties of particle size and crystallinity [116]. Acetylene black is a type of carbon black formed from the thermal degradation of acetylene and is characterised by high degree of crystalline orientation compared to other sources of carbon black, and thus is extremely electrically conductive though comparatively expensive. Due to their lower cost and high availability, high grade oil-furnace blacks, such as Vulcan XC-72, has attracted attention in electrochemical applications as a good compromise between high surface area of about 250 m 2 /g and a good electrical conductivity of about 3 S cm -1 [115].The microporous layer is applied to the gas diffusion layer where it is located between the carbon substrate and the electrocatalyst layer [114].

        <p>Conventionally, the carbon black particles are dispersed in a polymeric hydrophobic binding agent, typically PTFE. The hydrophobicity of the microporous layer provides a high capillary pressure to promote membrane hydration and prevent water flooding. Its presence has been shown to significantly improve fuel cell performance and durability. For example, Owejan et al. [117] found a 20-30% increase in performance when an MPL was applied to Toray TGP-H-060 and MRC105 under fully humidified conditions. Although initially added to the GDL in order to improve the electrical contact between the GDL and the electrocatalyst layer [118,119], Chen et al. [120] were also able to show that the MPL can improve liquid water management in the MEA. The main improvements are due to the MPL's ability to modify water accumulation and transport through the GDL [119][120][121][122]. This reduces flooding of the pores of the microporous layers and increases catalyst availability for the ORR. The effect of MPL composition on its transport properties has been the focus of numerous research papers. In particular the effect of PTFE content [82,83,123], optimisation of carbon loading on the Fig. 13.

        <p>Optimisation of the carbon black content in the MPL has been a point of contention for various research groups. Jordan et al. [124] reported that between about 1.25 and 1.9 mg cm -2 acetylene black in the MPL was the optimal for cell performance, whereas Park et al. [126] suggested that a carbon loading of 0.5 mg cm -2 of acetylene black was optimal for fuel cell operation, this was attributed to better air permeation (and therefore mass diffusion) through the thin MPL layer. More recently, Orogbemi et al. [125] found that a carbon loading of 2.0 mg cm 2 for Ketjenblack EC-300 J and Vulcan XC-72 is the most favourable for gas permeability. Typically, carbon weighting in the MPL ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 mg cm 2 , and this has a noticeable effect on MPL thickness and subsequently its mass and water transport capabilities [130].

        <p>The application of the MPL to the carbon substrate can carried out by various techniques. These include brush coating, the doctor blade technique, spray coating, rod coating, or screen printing [131]. Other novel methods of application are also under investigation [132]. The viscosity of the MPL slurry dictates the application method by which the MPL is applied to the carbon substrate. More viscous slurries can be applied to the substrate by brush or the doctor blade coating technique, whereas thinner slurries tend to be applied by spray coating. The MPL-coated GDL is then heat treated and sintered at e.g. 350 • C in order to melt the PTFE and thus bind the carbon black particles in the MPL together, as well as laminating the MPL to the carbon substrate [127,133]. The MPL has been reported to penetrate some way into the GDL under compression, creating a hybrid interlayer of substrate and MPL [11].The application of the MPL to the carbon substrate can carried out by various techniques.

As previously mentioned, although PTFE provides hydrophobicity to the GDL, its presence in the MPL has been shown to compromise reactant transport and the electron conductivity [12,82,83,134]. Moreover, the insolubility of PTFE means that the production of a homogenous carbon black/PTFE MPL slurry is reported to be difficult [135]. Other issues exist with PTFE-based MPL slurries, notably high viscosity, low phase stability (due to viscosity changes over time), cracking on the GDL surface during drying, and difficulty in the coating process [3].

        <p>As the MPL is a critical component for the transport of reactant gases and liquid water to and away from the electrocatalyst layer, the porosity and the pore size distribution of the MPL are determining factors in its ability to carry out this task successfully. Attempts have been made to control the pore structure of the MPL by using carbon black with different porosity profiles. Wang et al. [139] produced a composite MPL from carbon blacks with dissimilar pore size distribution (Black Pearls 2000 Acetylene Black), in order to create a bi-purpose pore structure for the optimal transport of liquid water and reactant gases. This resulted in higher power density (0.66 W cm -2 ) in the polarisation curves compared to when a single type of carbon black was used (0.55 W cm -2 ). More importantly, this technique allowed for the fabrication of an MPL with a graduated porosity, thus providing a gradient for enhanced fluid flow.As the MPL is a critical component for the transport of reactant gases and liquid water to and away from the electrocatalyst layer, the porosity and the pore size distribution of the MPL are determining factors in its ability to carry out this task successfully.

They were able to achieve this by the use of a pore forming agent (NH 4 Cl) in their screen-printing production process. They created a porosity gradient where the pore diameter decreased from the substrate to the electrocatalyst layer interface, with the aim of increasing the capillary pressure and forcing liquid water away from the catalyst. This microstructural design was effective at high current densities (&gt;700 mA cm 2 ), where flooding becomes a limiting factor, in agreement with Wang et al. [139].Similarly, Tang et al.

Acetylene black and graphene nanoplates were deposited in a layer by layer manner with the aim of controlling the particle arrangement, and thus the pore size through the layer. Polarisation curves performed in condensation state, at 120% relative humidity, showed that the MPLs with acetylene black at the surface i. e smaller particles and smaller pores improved oxygen diffusion rates at the high current density region (&gt;1.5 A cm -2 ) due to their ability to divert liquid water.

        <p>Cho et al. used laser-perforation to produce furrows in the MPL which replicate the serpentine land and channel patterns of the flow field plate, aiming at diverting liquid water away from the cathode catalyst layer to the outlet of the flow channel [146]. The furrows produced were ~20 μm wide with 2 mm spacing in the same serpentine pattern as the flow field plate, these were compared to a commercial unmodified MPL and an MPS without an MPL. They reported that the furrowed MPL excelled in high relative humidity condition (100% RH and 200% RH) with a higher power density than both the uncoated MPS and the pristine MPL coated GDL. The greatest performance enhancements were recorded at 200% relative humidity where it was argued that the furrows acted as liquid water pathways increasing the availability of pore space for reactant diffusion and active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. Further work could be undertaken on the optimisation of the furrow dimensions to enhance membrane hydration in low relative humidity conditions and to reduce liquid water saturation in high relative humidity conditions.Cho et al. used laser-perforation to produce furrows in the MPL which replicate the serpentine land and channel patterns of the flow field plate, aiming at diverting liquid water away from the cathode catalyst layer to the outlet of the flow channel [146].

        <p>Patterned microporous layers are an innovative design modification similar to MPL perforation with the purpose of creating areas on the MPL dedicated to the removal of liquid water [144,147]. Lee et al. [144] used laser ablation to produce a ditch-like pattern on the MPL surface which were intended to act as channels for liquid water. MPLs were produced with perforations, and with ditches parallel and perpendicular to the channel; these were compared to a commercial MPL coated GDL. Marked improvements reactant transport were seen when the ditches were positioned perpendicular to the channel, whereas the ditches formed in parallel to the channel decreased mass transport due to liquid water stagnation in the ditches as water is not able to move from the rib to the channel. Polarisation curves performed at 100% relative humidity indicate that the ditch-like etchings on the MPL were more effective at relieving liquid water saturation than dthe perforated MPL. The perforated MPL suffered severe voltage drops at 0.5 A cm -2 due to flooding, which was confirmed by the Nyquist plots produced. Various methods and designs have been used to produce patterned MPLs to accelerate liquid water removal. One method used the recrystallization and pyrolysis of ammonium chloride to form flower-like patterns on the MPL [147]. Chen et al. [147] varied the percentage mass of the pore former, ammonium chloride to produce different pore structures. The inclusion of 40 wt % pore former resulted in the formation of perforations through the MPL where not present at 20 wt%. Impedance spectra and polarisation curves show that the 20 wt % MPL suffered mass transport losses and performed significantly worse than the commercial GDL. However, the MPL containing 40 wt % pore former resulted in the formation of perforations through the MPL that were not present at 20 wt%. Impedance spectra and polarisation curves showed that the MPL with 20 wt % pore former suffered from mass transport losses and performed significantly worse than the commercial GDL. However, the MPL containing 40 wt % pore former in the inner layer (close to MPS) and 20 wt % pore former in the outer layer (close to the catalyst layer) produced the highest power density and reduced mass transport limitations particular in humidified conditions (100% relative humidity). The porosity gradient in this MPL provided a higher capillary pressure for water removal which when coupled with the flower-like pattern enhanced the distribution of reactant gases and mitigated the accumulation of liquid water in the pore space.Patterned microporous layers are an innovative design modification similar to MPL perforation with the purpose of creating areas on the MPL dedicated to the removal of liquid water [144,147].

        <p>Additionally, some groups have investigated carbon black as a freestanding MPL with varying successes [45,[148][149][150]. For example, Shim et al. [45] fabricated a carbon composite GDL from a mixture of Vulcan XC-72 and PTFE (20-50 wt %) which was rolled to form a sheet, then heat treated to 340 • C to melt the PTFE, which acted both as a binder and a hydrophobic agent. Fuel cell MEA tests indicated that the performance of all carbon black based substrate was inferior to the conventional LT 1200 MPS (Fig. 17 Similarly, Chen-Yang et al. [148] fabricated composites from Vulcan XC-72 and PTFE (0, 10 and 20 wt%). Again, all of the carbon black based substrate exhibited just half the power density of the commercial MPL coated ELAT® GDL (E-TEK). Since the electrical conductivity of carbon black is comparable to the carbon paper GDLs, the poor performance can be attributed to lower gas permeability. Conventional carbon paper has an abundance of macropores which facilitate high gas flux. However, carbon black composites are largely meso-and microporous, meaning that gaseous reactants must compete with the liquid water when diffusing through the pores, leading to mass transport losses. This limitation of the Vulcan XC-72 GDL is supported by the measured the air flux and the permeability of the carbon black GDL being significantly lower than the LT 1200 MPL coated carbon paper (9.77 × 10 -12 and 218.6 × 10 -12 respectively). Moreover, the PTFE content of these carbon black GDLs is quite high (up to 50%), this is likely to have reduced the porosity and blocked the pathways for reactant gases. Although Shim found that the power density increases up to 40% wt. PTFE, this is likely due to the reduction in flooding phenomena.Additionally, some groups have investigated carbon black as a freestanding MPL with varying successes [45,[148][149][150].

Although Shim found that the power density increases up to 40% wt. PTFE, this is likely due to the reduction in flooding phenomena.</p>
        <p>Bauder et al. produced in-house non-woven synthetic supports for a carbon black/PTFE MPL, with 20 and 40% wt. PTFE content [151]. These exhibited lower contact angle and through-plane resistance compared to MPL-coated SGL 25BC, with the 40% wt. PTFE blend having the best properties. By increasing the thickness of the 20% wt. blend MPL, they achieved comparable power density to SGL 25BC. However, at high relative humidity, flooding caused mass transport losses. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to evaluate the resistance losses, and synchrotron radiography was used to assess liquid water distribution, in operando.Bauder et al. produced in-house non-woven synthetic supports for a carbon black/PTFE MPL, with 20 and 40% wt.

        <p>Ito et al. [152] produced a free-standing MPL sheet from acetylene black and PTFE (10% wt.). This was tested as it was, as well as being applied to Toray TGP-H090 and H060 carbon substrates. The total thickness was ~300 μm for all samples [152]. Fig. 18 shows the polarisation curves, and the free-standing MPL (i.e. GDL 5) produced the highest voltage, particularly at high current densities, at all values of relative humidity. Interestingly the free-standing MPL was highly microand mesoporous (Fig. 18), with very few macropores, like the free-standing MPL produced by Shim et al. [45]. As macropores are believed to be the primary pathway for gas diffusion, the higher power density produced by the free-standing MPL does not corroborate the results of other research groups, although the type of carbon black and PTFE loading may have been influential. Ito et al. [152] attributed the good results of their free-standing MPL to its low thermal conductivity that raises the temperature of the GDL, increasing the saturation pressure and consequently mitigating water liquid.Ito et al.

        <p>However, the free-standing MPL, in its present state, was regarded as largely unsuitable for application in PEMFC as it lacked the necessary mechanical strength and flexibility which would limit the durability in the MEA [2]. Despite this, these problems could potentially be overcome by mixing the MPL materials with, for example, some reinforcing carbon fibres or carbon nanotubes to improve the mechanical stability and strength of these free-standing GDL. For example, some research groups have created composite buckypapers from carbon black, carbon nanotubes and carbon fibres [79,[153][154][155][156].However, the free-standing MPL, in its present state, was regarded as largely unsuitable for application in PEMFC as it lacked the necessary mechanical strength and flexibility which would limit the durability in the MEA [2].

        <p>For example, recent work by Kim et al. [156] produced a free-standing MPLs from multiwall carbon nanotubes using chemical vapour deposition. The thickness of the MWCNT sheet was reported to have the largest effect on the effectivity of the MPL on fuel cell performance, where the thinner the sheet the greater the electrochemical performance. The thinnest sheet fabricated (15 μm) produced the highest power density of all of the sheets (1297 mW cm -2 ) even compared to the commercial MPL coated 39BC GDL (1023 mW cm -2 ), as well as the highest OCV and limiting current density. The thicker sheets, 30 μm and 100 μm, had an electrochemical performance far lower than the commercial at 660 mW cm -2 and 305 mW cm -2 respectively. The favourable reaction kinetics of the 15 μm compared to the thicker sheets was attributed to an inability of the thicker sheets to drain the water produced leading to pore saturation, and reduced reactant diffusion. The greatest improvements of the 15 μm were when the cathode side is supplied with air which implies that, it successfully reduced mass transport losses rather than enhancing electrical conductivity between the MPL and catalyst layer. As the thinnest sheet produced the best performance rather work is needed on producing even thinner MWCNT sheets to see the optimal sheet thickness in regards to performance enhancement.For example, recent work by Kim et al.

        <p>Finally, Duan et al. [157] electrospun a freestanding carbon nanofibre sheet which possessed good electrical conductivity and hydrophobicity, and applied this as an MPL. This exhibited a higher permeability than a Vulcan XC-72 carbon powder and 40 wt% FEP coated GDL. When used at the cathode, a high peak power density (321 mW cm -2 ) was achieved, corresponding to 23% improvement compared to the conventional MPL.

        <p>Carbon nanotubes have shown potential as an exciting new MPL material, due to their high electrical conductivity and their resistance to corrosion in oxidative environments [158][159][160][161][162][163]. A large breadth of investigations has shown their potential as carbonaceous MPL materials. The majority of these studies have focused on multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/carbon black composites, although early work by Kannan et al. [160,161] completely replaced Vulcan XC-72 carbon black with graphitized MWCNTs grown in-situ by chemical vapour deposition. They reported that the graphitized MWCNTs exhibit more desirable characteristics for use in the MPL; with a contact angle of 150 • , and a more homogenous surface morphology. Fuel cell MEA tests revealed greater power density especially in the high current density region.

        <p>In general, investigations into carbon nanotube based MPLs show that they are characterised by superior electronic conductivity and permeability. Gharibi et al. [159] showed that the addition of MWCNTs to carbon black increased the gas permeability, pore volume and conductivity (from 233.71 s cm -1 to 291.18 s cm -1 ) of MPLs, consistent with results and observations by Stampino et al. [158] and Lin et al. [162]. Lin et al. [162]created an MPL using MWCNTs in addition to acetylene black, resulting in greater permeability and electrical conductivity, from 28 S m -1 34 S m -1 for 0% MWCNT and 80% MWCNT respectively. They found that a carbon loading of 1.5 mg cm 2 and a 1:4 ratio of acetylene black to MWCNT by mass resulted in optimum fuel cell performance (0.915 W cm -2 ). Schweiss et al. [163,164] applied an in-house MWCNT MPL to a Sigracet SGL 25BN GDL, which was compared to MPL-coated Sigracet SGL 25 BC. They reported an 8-fold increase in the gas permeability for the MWCNT-based MPL, and the ohmic resistance was reduced by 9%.

        <p>Lee et al. [16] produced an MPL by blending 21% wt. MWCNT into a carbon black and PTFE dispersion. This was compared with uncoated SGL 25BA and MPL-coated SGL 25BC. The pore size distribution was wider for the MWCNT-based MPL, and the mass transport resistance was lower. This was attributed to the prevention of carbon black agglomeration due to the high aspect ratio of MWCNT and resulted in an increase in fuel cell power density. At 2.5 A cm -2 and 3.0 A cm -2 the in-house 25BN MWCNT MPL were 6.7% and 94.1% higher than the commercial SGL 25BC; the much higher cell voltage difference at 3.0 A cm -2 was due to the massive mass transport losses demonstrated by the fuel cell running with SGL 25BC. In a highly informative innovation, they visualised the in-operando liquid water distribution in the MEA. Interestingly, although the liquid water saturation was shown to be greater in the case of the CNT-MPL, the fuel cell performance was better even at high relative humidity. At high current densities (i.e. &gt; 250 mA cm -2 ), the MWCNT-based MPL improved the power density by 94.1%, attributed to the MPL being thinner, the higher porosity, and the larger pores. This research highlighted the importance of pore size in the MPL, in support of the theory proposed by Kong et al. [165] that a higher proportion of small macropores (5-10 μm) in the MPL can enhance PEMFC performance. This structure is thought to allow liquid water permeation, whilst not restricting the reactant gas pathways. Similar findings were reported by Tanuma et al. [166], who conducted a thorough comparison of composite MPLs. They prepared hydrophilic MPLs from carbons with different physical and micro-structural properties, namely carbon black, MWCNTs, vapour grown carbon fibres (VGCFs), and melt-spun carbon fibre. They investigated the pore size distribution and mean pore diameter, finding that the VGCFs had the largest median pore diameter, whilst carbon black and melt-spun carbon fibres had the lowest. VGCF-based MPLS also yielded the highest fuel cell power density, with carbon black and melt-spun carbon fibres having the lowest. Thus, larger pore volume was linked to performance via enhanced mass transport, by providing gas diffusion pathways and preventing flooding.Lee et al. [16] produced an MPL by blending 21% wt.

        <p>Innovative work has been also undertaken by growing carbon nanotube directly on carbon paper substrates, via chemical vapour deposition [160,[167][168][169][170]. The aim of this is to increase the contact between the GDL and the electrocatalyst layer, and the formation of a hybrid catalyst/microporous, thus improving the diffusion characteristics, reducing charge transfer losses, and increase catalyst utilisation. For example, Sandström et al. [167] grew carbon nanotubes on an SGL 34 AA carbon paper using different temperatures and flow rates of C 2 H 4 . These were then doped with Pt particles and acted as a multifunctional layer. They reported a reduction in charge transfer resistance of 38% using this technique compared with Vulcan XC-72 as Pt support. Tang et al.

The maximum power density of 670 mW cm -2 was reached from the MEA with the in-situ grown CNT MPL compared to carbon black and commercial CNT, with a peak power density of 590 mW cm -2 and 365 mW cm -2 respectively..

        <p>For example. Leeuwner et al. [173] fabricated a free-standing MPL for the cathode GDL from commercially available compressed 3D freestanding graphene foam (ACS Materials). The initial 3D honeycomb structure is reduced to a layered flake-like structure on compression. The in-plane electrical conductivity was relatively high in comparison to SGL 25 BC (333 S m -1 and 29 S m -1 ) respectively) due to the conductive pathways within the graphene foam, and the compressibility of the foam enabled good contact between the GDL and the electrocatalyst layer, reducing charge transfer losses. However, the lack of treatment with hydrophobic agent was a limiting factor, resulting in a large variation in the contact angle (87 • ± 16.5), and attributed inhomogeneity of the surface when compressed. From the polarisation curves, the graphene MPL performs well at mid-range current density (e.g. 362 mW cm -2 , compared to 334 mW cm -2 for SGL 25BC commercial MPL coated at 500 mA cm 2 ). However, at higher current densities (&gt;1500 mAcm -2 ) the commercial MPL was better, due to flooding in the less hydrophobic graphene MPL.For example. Leeuwner et al.

        <p>Najafabad et al. [172]produced electrochemically exfoliated graphene for use as an MPL material. Fig. 16 shows the SEM micrographs of the flake-like graphene structure and the cross-section of the graphene MPL. However, the graphene sheet-like structure prevented water removal from the three-phase boundary, and hence led to a performance drop under high-humidity operation, due to flooding.

        <p>Overall, research into graphene based MPLs remains extremely limited, although it can potentially increase cell efficiency. Further research is required to understand the limitations of the material and how it can reduce membrane dry-out without losing efficiency at high relative humidities and current densities. Greater knowledge is needed to understand the performance loss from restacking of graphene platelets and the optimal microstructure for reactant transport and water management. Mixing graphene with carbon black, or a mixture of graphene with different morphologies has the potential for a synergetic effect on MPL morphology and microstructure optimal for two-phase flow.Overall, research into graphene based MPLs remains extremely limited, although it can potentially increase cell efficiency.

        <p>Carbon-free, metallic MPL materials have also been explored due to the high electronic conductivity and corrosion resistance of some metals.

[173] investigated a series of free-standing MPLs fabricated from different materials, one of which was a perforated stainless steel sheet, of the same thickness as SGL 25 BC (50 μm) with a 21% porosity and 500 μm pore size. Although the in-plane resistance was extremely low, the interfacial contact resistance with the catalyst layer was three times larger than the SGL 25BC. This is attributed to the steel plate having low surface roughness, corresponding to a contact area between the steel surface and the electrocatalyst interface. The fuel cell polarisation curve showed that the perforated steel sheet produced a lower power density than even the uncoated GDL substrate. Again, this is attributed to the high contact resistance, but also the much lower porosity compared to typical MPLs, which is essential for reactant transport.Carbon-free, metallic MPL materials have also been explored due to the high electronic conductivity and corrosion resistance of some metals.

        <p>Titanium has also attracted research interest as an MPL material. Fang et al. [179] deposited titanium on to SGL10 BA carbon paper as a thin film by magnetron spluttering (Fig. 19 (right)). Titanium-based powders also seem to offer potential as MPL materials: iridium-titanium nitride (Ir-TiN) [178], iridium oxide and titanium particles IrO 2 /T [177], and titanium (Ti) [176,179] have all been explored. Hwang et al. found that a titanium powder MPL applied to a titanium felt substrate (Fig. 19 (left)) increased the mesopore size and the MPL hydrophobicity, improving liquid water management and reactant transport at high relative humidity (100%). However, at lower relative humidity (&lt;66%), where water is more present in the vapour phase, it proved less effective. Metal powders are promising in terms of their desirable transport characteristics and pore structure. Moreover, advances in 3D metal powder printing, as demonstrated by Jayakumar [74] for the substrate, will allow control over pore size and structure. However, limitations exist in the cost of materials, production costs and arguably dimensions of the MEA on upscale.Titanium has also attracted research interest as an MPL material. Fang et al.

Hwang et al. found that a titanium powder MPL applied to a titanium felt substrate (Fig. 19 (left)) increased the mesopore size and the MPL hydrophobicity, improving liquid water management and reactant transport at high relative humidity (100%). However, at lower relative humidity (&lt;66%), where water is more present in the vapour phase, it proved less effective. Metal powders are promising in terms of their desirable transport characteristics and pore structure. Moreover, advances in 3D metal powder printing, as demonstrated by Jayakumar [74] for the substrate, will allow control over pore size and structure. However, limitations exist in the cost of materials, production costs and arguably dimensions of the MEA on upscale.</p>
        <p>Novel MPL materials present an exciting future in fuel cell engineering, especially the application of carbons with differing aspects to conventional carbon black, e.g. graphene platelets and carbon nanotubes. The material basis of the MPL determines the morphology and microstructure of the porous media, and thus influences the reactant pathways and water management in the MPL and the MEA as a whole. Due to its unique MPL micro-structure, graphene based MPLs are becoming an extremely popular research area. Moreover, composite MPLs formed of carbons with different aspects have a synergetic effect on the MPL morphology, where reactant transport and liquid water is better managed than the single material based MPL. This opens up a multitude of possibilities for MPL material compositions, the optimisation of which can be greatly accelerated by the use of micro-scale modelling. Current MPL research is limited by a lack of consistency, which makes comparison of the effect of the materials themselves highly difficult. For example, characterisation methods vary between papers making it hard to establish the cause for high/low power density or good/bad water transport phenomena. Furthermore, these findings are drawn from in-house MPLs where the method of application of the MPL to the substrate is variable. It has been remarked that the application method can affect the microstructural properties of the whole GDL, particularly the substrate MPL/interface [180]. This is largely disregarded, and conclusions are drawn on the basis of the material composition of the applied layer.Novel MPL materials present an exciting future in fuel cell engineering, especially the application of carbons with differing aspects to conventional carbon black, e.g. graphene platelets and carbon nanotubes.

        <p>Conventionally the carbon black in the microporous layer is mixed with PTFE as a hydrophobic binder, in order to prevent flooding of the porous media during fuel cell operation, especially at high current densities. However, the use of PTFE as a hydrophobic agent has an adverse effect on the physical, microstructural and transport characteristics of the MPL.

        <p>Super hydrophobicity is achieved when the contact angle of a material exceeds 150 • . One branch of research is focused on improving the hydrophobicity of the microporous layer using similar materials to PTFE, aiming to increase the contact angle whilst also reducing ohmic and mass transfer losses. For example, a significant amount of research has also been conducted into the viability of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a replacement binder for use in the porous media of PEMFC. For example, Su et al. [182] fabricated gas diffusion electrodes using 15% wt. PVDF as the catalyst layer binder. They concluded that polyvinylidene fluoride improved surface morphology, and improved distribution of catalyst particles on the surface, increasing the availability of active sites. A peak power density to 0.56 W cm -2 was measured compared to 0.20 W cm -2 using Nafion as a binder. Zhang et al. [183] investigated PVDF for the anion exchange membrane fuel cells; similarly they found that using PVDF as a binder in the MPL increases the catalytic activity.Super hydrophobicity is achieved when the contact angle of a material exceeds 150 • .

        <p>Meanwhile, Park et al. [135] fabricated a polyvinylidene fluoride-based MPL from a slurry with carbon black, which was applied to a carbon cloth GDL using the doctor blade method. MPLs with various ratios of PVDF and carbon black were compared with a PTFE-based MPL, and uncoated GDLs. SEM images revealed that the surface morphology of the PVDF-based MPL had greater uniformity than the PTFE-based MPL. The large cracks that are characteristic of PTFE-based MPLs were not present for PVDF; which was instead characterised by small pores. The use of PVDF as a binder resulted in significantly higher fuel cell power density, which they attributed to the appropriate in-plane and through-plane microstructure observed in the SEM images. However, hydrophobicity of the MPL could also have been highly influential, as the untreated GDL only reached a maximum current density 0.3 Acm 2 compared to the 1.2 Acm 2 for the PVDF-based MPL. Since no contact angle measurements were performed and the relative humidity of the fuel cell tests was not recorded, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this study.Meanwhile, Park et al.

        <p>Ong et al. [185] also prepared a PVDF-based MPL via phase-inversion of PVDF and Vulcan XC-72 carbon black, which was then applied to a commercial wet-proofed cloth E-TEK GDL which was exposed for 30s and then immersed in a water bath. Increasing the PVDF content of the MPL from 5 to 10% wt. decreased the permeability significantly from 23.99 to 0.57 × 10 -4 mol s -1 Pa -1 m -2 and whereas the increase in resistivity of MPL is insignificant (0.50-0.52 Ω). Two PVDF solutions were prepared for the carbon black dispersion, using different solvents: N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The DMF cast MPL measured a higher resistance (0.062 Ω) than the NMP cast MPL (0.053 Ω), though the permeability values did not vary. The PVDF MPL GDL produced a higher limiting current density and greater peak power density (0.33 W cm _2 ) than the blank and the 40% wt. PTFE MPL (0.25 W cm -2 ). The difference in potential was particularly higher in current densities &gt;0.3 A cm -2 thus having superior mass transport properties at higher current densities. This was attributed to the microstructure of the PVDF MPL being an asymmetric porous structure with cavities, in which the in-plane and through-plane mass transport is enhanced. As this GDL was not subject to heat treatment or sintering, a comparison of the surface morphology of the PVDF MPL heat treated and immersed would prove interesting, especially when combined with in-situ imaging of water distribution. Phase immersion may produce a smoother, more homogeneous PVDF coating, yielding different results to when the MPL is heat treated.Ong et al.

        <p>In addition, perfluoropolyether-based microporous layers have been studied [186,187]. PFPE binds strongly with carbon black due to its high surface area and porosity, allowing for the ease of adsorption of PFPE. Moreover, perfluoropolyethers can be chemically linked to the carbon black producing PFPE-functionalised carbons which are highly stable and can reach the super-hydrophobic threshold (157 • at 8% wt.) [104]. PFPE-functionalised carbon blacks offer a promising alternative to carbon black-PTFE composites as unlike PTFE, the conductivity is preserved in the PFPE-modified carbon black because the electrical continuity of the conductive carbon network is maintained [188].

        <p>Experiments conducted by Navarrini et al.

PTFE, where the voltage drop occurs at 1.30 A cm -2 rather than 1.0 A cm -2 . Thus a 30% increase in current density was achieved by the substitution of PTFE with functionalised-PFPE. The peak density was increased from around 0.42 W cm _2 to 0.45 W cm -2 , which was attributed to better reactant diffusion due to improved water management and higher gas permeability.

The authors' explanation was that the larger cracks in the MPL surface improved permeability and diffusive properties of the MPL, however this is not conducive with other findings as larger cracks increase the resistance at the MPL and catalyst layer interface. It is more likely that the increase in PFPE concentration reduced the available pore space and thus limited reactant diffusion.a Unless otherwise states, the peak power density was reported with 100% RH and oxygen as an oxidant.

        <p>The characterisation of fluorinated polymers in the MPL by Latorrata et al. [190] is highly informative.

The FEP-based MPL was reported to have the highest contact angle of 160 • , whilst the PTFE-based MPL had the lowest contact angle, making it the least hydrophobic. Correspondingly, the fluorinated ethylene polymer -based MPL had the highest maximum power density, and the lowest mass transport losses in fuel cell tests. For example, at 1.0 A cm -2 , the FEP-based MPL was measured to have a potential of 1.0 V, compared to 0.8 V for the PTFE-based MPL (Fig. 21).

        <p>Another branch of research is directed towards the study of hydrophilic MPLs. Instead of conventional hydrophobic MPLs, where the aim is to push water through and out of the fuel cell, the aim of hydrophilic MPLs is to pull water out of the electrocatalyst layer. The potential of hydrophilic MPLs to mitigate water flooding at high current densities has been reported in several studies [164,166,193,194]. For example, Aoyama et al. [166] compared hydrophobic and hydrophilic MPLs of various thicknesses, conducting polarisation measurements in fully humidified conditions. They reported that hydrophobic MPLs had the highest cell resistance, and that the hydrophilic carbon fibre MPL produced a higher voltage than the hydrophobic carbon black MPL at high current densities (0.4 V and 0.3 V respectively at 1.6 A cm -2 ). It was deduced that the hydrophilic MPL surface allows water to spread across the MPL surface and promotes evaporation within the large pores and thus the thick hydrophilic MPLs may be more effective when there is more liquid water produced. Similarly, Tanuma et al. [195] also developed a novel hydrophilic MPL composed of vapour grown carbon fibres with hydrophilic ionomer, resulting in MEAs with higher power density compared to those with hydrophobic MPLs, across a range of different relative humidities. Different MPL architectures were more influential at different relative humidities; where at low RH (30%) the mean pore diameter was the largest factor, conversely at high RH (100%) pore volume was the greatest contributor to power density. The greatest power density (0.75 W cm -2 ) was achieved at 30% RH.Another branch of research is directed towards the study of hydrophilic MPLs.

        <p>The majority of research into PEMFC is targeted at improving MEA performance in high humidity conditions; however it is also necessary to optimise PEMFC design for low humidity condition &gt; this is because PEMFCs are to be applied to a broad spectrum of applications (aerospace, stationary and portable applications) and these have different operating requirements and reactant feeds. In low relative humidity conditions, maintaining membrane hydration for optimal ionic conductivity is the largest challenge. To this end, investigations on how to create hydrophilic MPLs allowing for PEMFC self-humidification have been conducted [196,197]. A hydrophilic anodic was produced Guo et al. [196] by ultraviolet treatment of TiO 2 particles, to reduce the membrane resistance in low humidity conditions. The hydrophilic MPL reportedly decreased both the charge transfer resistance at low current densities, and the ohmic and mass transport resistance at high current densities, improving performance at both low (100 mA cm -2 and high (1200 mA cm -2 ) current densities. Other works have used UV treatment of the MPL to create hydrophilic regions with the aim of producing a GDL with graded hydrophobicity for the diversion of liquid water away from the catalyst layer [198]. The UV treatment leads to the formation of OH radicals on the of the gas flow channel side of the GDL, thus reducing the hydrophobicity and creating a GDL with graded wettability from the catalyst layer to the gas flow channel [198].The majority of research into PEMFC is targeted at improving MEA performance in high humidity conditions; however it is also necessary to optimise PEMFC design for low humidity condition &gt; this is because PEMFCs are to be applied to a broad spectrum of applications (aerospace, stationary and portable applications) and these have different operating requirements and reactant feeds.

[199] used neutron radiography to visualise the liquid water distribution, in-situ. An MPL was produced by incorporating 10% hydrophilic alumosilicate fibres into a conventional hydrophobic carbon black MPL slurry and applied to an SGL 24AA GDL, and comparison made with a commercial SGL 25BC. The addition of the hydrophilic fibres increased voltage by 150 mV at 2 A cm -2 , increasing power density by 30% Liquid water distribution was analysed to understand the different in power density. The water profile across a cross-section of the cell operating at 1.0 A cm -2 was obtained by neutron imaging (Fig. 22). In the hydrophobic MPL, indicated by the red line, the peak indicates that liquid water saturation is concentrated close to the cathode catalyst layer, moreover the MPL has a low water content as can be seen by the drop when moving away from the MEA. In contrast the MPL with hydrophilic fibres, shown by the blue line, has a more liquid water in the MPL region evidenced by the steadier water content profile. Additionally, there is no peak at the cathode catalyst area, indicating that liquid water saturation is lower at the cathode catalyst layer, thus, indicating that the loss in power of the hydrophobic 25BC were mass transport losses due to liquid water saturation.In order to provide deeper understanding of how hydrophilic regions in the MPLs facilitate liquid water transport in MEAs, Mukundan et al.

        <p>Furthermore, the addition of alumosilicate, hydrophilic fibres into the hydrophobic MPL improved mean pore diameter. The increased pore diameter facilitated the movement of liquid water away from the MPL/ catalyst interface, where the hydrophilic pores provided pathways in the MPL, wicking the water away from the cathode.Furthermore, the addition of alumosilicate, hydrophilic fibres into the hydrophobic MPL improved mean pore diameter.

        <p>An innovative dual-layer MPL was developed by Kitahara et al. [149,201], with a thin hydrophilic MPL deposited directly onto a conventional hydrophobic MPL, for low relative humidity operation. The hydrophilic MPLs were composed of 95% carbon black mixed with 5% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or TiO 2 (titanium dioxide). They reported that the hydrophilic MPL preserves the membrane humidity, whilst the hydrophobic layer prevents removal of water from the hydrophilic MPL by evaporation. The dual-layer hydrophilic/hydrophobic (5%. wt PVA) MPL produced greater power than the hydrophobic PTFE MPL, particularly in the mass transport region, where at 1.2 A cm -2 the voltage was 0.5 V and 0.3 V respectively. Further performance enhancements was done by optimising the PTFE content, and thus the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic layer [149]. A further innovation was the development of a triple-layer MPL by the Kitahara et al. [202] where, the substrate was coated in a hydrophobic MPL (10 wt% PTFE), followed by another hydrophobic MPL (30 wt% PTFE), and finally a hydrophilic PVA-based MPL (Fig. 23). This resulted in further improvements in the fuel cell performance, which was attributed to the hydrophobic gradient which successfully expelled liquid water from the electrocatalyst layer at high relative humidity. The most influential aspect of this group's work is the introduction of the concept of gradated MPLs, rather than limiting the design to one single layer with a homogeneous microstructure.An innovative dual-layer MPL was developed by Kitahara et al.

        <p>Recently, the effect of a non-uniform pore distribution on liquid water transport in the GDL has been numerically modelled [208,209]. Shangguan et al. produced 5 GDL geometries with different pore distributions: uniform porosity; graduated pore size from large (macro) to small (micro) with different intensity; and graduated from small (micro) to large (macro) with different intensity [209]. Their model predicted that the GDL with a non-uniform porosity distribution from macro to micro pores, with a low porosity gradient liquid promotes rapid water removal and relieves water saturation. Their model also predicted that the hydrophilic (70 • ) GDL experienced liquid water saturation regardless of the pore structure.Recently, the effect of a non-uniform pore distribution on liquid water transport in the GDL has been numerically modelled [208,209].

        <p>In a related work Kanchan et al. [209] produced 5 different geometries for the cathodic GDL to investigate their influence on oxygen concentration and power density. The porosity distribution was varied by increasing and decreasing porosity from the inlet to the outlet (in the streamwise direction), and increasing and decreasing porosity from the gas flow channels to the catalyst layer (stepwise direction). The model indicates that when the porosity is decreased from the inlet to the outlet, the molar oxygen concentration is the highest, and power density and current density are the highest. This is attributed to the high porosity (0.6) of the cathode inlet allowing for less resistance to the flow of oxygen. The model also indicates that when porosity is increased from the catalyst layer to the flow channels the resulting power density and current density are relatively higher, in agreement with experimental and modelling data [209].In a related work Kanchan et al.

        <p>Although significant improvements have been made to computational models of porous media in PEMFCs, there are still a number of challenges that need to be overcome to simulate an accurate reflection of the porous media, and the transport phenomena therein. One such area that requires a deeper understanding is the thermal conductivity in the gas diffusion media. Ex-situ characterisation of the thermal transport is highly simplified for what is extremely complicated due the differences in the thermal conductivity of the solid and pore spaces, and the anisotropic microstructure. Yet the thermal conductivity of the porous media is essential for a complete understanding of liquid water behaviour in the MEA, both by causing membrane dry-out and reducing pore saturation by enabling entrance into the vapour phase and subsequent transport. The inaccurate modelling of thermal conductivity of the gas diffusion is thus a current limitation to the accurate modelling of reactant and water transport in the GDL.Although significant improvements have been made to computational models of porous media in PEMFCs, there are still a number of challenges that need to be overcome to simulate an accurate reflection of the porous media, and the transport phenomena therein.

        <p>GDLs are widely acknowledged as critically important components for optimal performance of PEMFCs. To this end, they have been subject to a great deal of research. The use of alternative materials for the macroporous substrate and the MPL has seen various successes, where the importance of pore size distribution is an integral factor. Developments in more sustainable source materials, such as bamboo fibre for the carbon substrate, divergence from PTFE, and simplification of the manufacturing process will further improve the sustainability and reduce the cost of production of PEMFCs.GDLs are widely acknowledged as critically important components for optimal performance of PEMFCs.

        <p>The potential of the GDL in the management of liquid water in the MEA is the largest driver of this research. Various methods have been explored to reduce flooding, whilst maintaining membrane hydration. One branch of research aims to reduce catalyst flooding by creating superhydrophobic GDLs. On the other hand, gradation of the MPL microstructure and water contact angle can effectively manage the water distribution in the PEMFC. In-operando imaging has allowed for the visualisation of liquid water in the MEA, making it possible to further optimise the pore structure of the porous media. The duality of twophase flow of reactants and liquid is still not fully understood particularly at higher current densities; the potential for simulations based on in-operando data will greatly assist in this as a prior step to experimental work.The potential of the GDL in the management of liquid water in the MEA is the largest driver of this research.

        <p>In terms of the microporous layer, it seems that alternative materials to carbon black, particularly carbon nanotubes, can improve the peak power density of the fuel cell, although there is a definitive lack of durability testing which raises questions for the suitability of these materials in practice. Likewise, preliminary studies undertaken using graphitized carbon black and graphene have exhibited promising results (higher power density and preferential ex-situ characteristics), yet again they are limited by a lack of research into their applicability for commercial use. Further research into graphene as a replacement for carbon black is necessary, owing to its preferential physical characteristics and early studies have shown its potential for use in the microporous layer. Moreover, the cost of materials is an important consideration in the commercial fuel cell sector. Performance enhancements with carbon nanotubes and graphene need to be balanced against increased cost of materials.In terms of the microporous layer, it seems that alternative materials to carbon black, particularly carbon nanotubes, can improve the peak power density of the fuel cell, although there is a definitive lack of durability testing which raises questions for the suitability of these materials in practice.
