        <p>The use of organic dyes to promote organic reactions by photoredox catalysis is continuosly expanding, and was recently reviewed by Nicewicz. The synthesis of new dyes, their application in flow photoredox reactions, their use in stereoselective and multicomponent trasformations have considerably expanded the repertoir of application of organic dyes in photoredox mediated reactions. The minor costs of these dyes, their tailored synthesis and availability in combination with the development of new concepts and careful catalytic cycle design (made possible by the application of fine theoretical investigations and deep understanding) are guiding the widespread application of organic dyes in the metalla photoredox catalysis area.

        <p>In photosynthesis, Nature uses light to drive chemical endergonic reactions transforming light's energy into chemical energy. Recently, laboratories all around the world are taking advantage of light in order to promote new organic reactions. In the last decade, photocatalysis applied to organic reactions has become a widely investigated subject. 1 Even if photochemistry has been a deeply investigated area, 2,3 both from a theoretical 4 and a practical 5 point of view, photochemistry applied to organic reactions has been mainly limited to direct excitation of one of the reactants by UV light. The use of photosensitizers, capable of absorbing visible light and promoting photoinduced electron or energy transfer processes, determined a revolution in the field for two main reasons: (i) less expensive light sources, particularly LEDs, or even sunlight, can be employed; (ii) visible light excitation can be selectively absorbed by the photosensitizers, avoiding photodegradation reactions of the organic substrates. The guiding model for the use of a photosensitizer is related to the properties of its excited state in terms of energy, lifetime and redox properties. To date, metal complexes, such as Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes are considered exceptional photosensitizers in photoredox catalysis thanks to their long excited-state lifetimes and higher chemical stability of the oxidized and reduced forms. 6 However, ruthenium and iridium are rare and heavy elements. The use of photoredox catalysts based on Earth abundant metals 7 has attracted growing interest, 8 but still there are some drawbacks, such as supply (cobalt), efficiency (iron), and toxicity (nickel), that have limited their application in large-scale synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). 9 The use of organic dyes as photosensitizers can overcome these drawbacks. Indeed, the diversity obtained by simple modification of known structures, 10 guided by theoretical tools, 11 offers potential solutions for the optimization of synthetic photoredox methodologies. In addition, there are advantages in employing organic dyes as photosensitizers related to their synthesis, scale-up, the absence of metals, and the possibility of selecting between many classes of organic compounds with a fine tuning of electronic and photophysical properties. A comprehensive and impressive review about organic molecules used as photosensitizers was recently reported by Nicewicz. 12 In the review collected by Nicewicz it is possible for the readers to address questions related to photophysical properties of the major classes of organic molecules employed in photoredox reactions. In 2011 a breakthrough was published by Sanford, 13 followed in 2014 by two key papers published by Doyle-MacMillan 14 and Molander, 15 exploiting the brilliant idea to use photoredox catalysis in metal-mediated processes. 16 The studies were carried out with iridium complex based photosensitizers. From the initial studies involving nickel catalysis 17 many metals, such as copper, 18 gold, 19 palladium, 20 rhodium, 21 ruthenium, 22 iron, 23 titanium 24 were employed in synergistic combination with metal photosensitizers in innovative catalytic processes. However, soon, the use of organic dyes started to be investigated to replace the expensive ruthenium and iridium photosensitizers, for more sustainable applications and methodologies. Since the synergistic metal catalysis with organic dyes has reached nowadays a high level of complexity and broad application, in this review we present the most salient results in this field. We have summarized the work done selecting a particular class of dyes, presenting different metal mediated processes, shedding light on the mechanistic understanding, the reaction investigated, and the results obtained.In photosynthesis, Nature uses light to drive chemical endergonic reactions transforming light's energy into chemical energy.

        <p>Starting from the earliest developments of organic photoredox catalysis, several classes of organic dyes have been used to promote light-mediated processes. To date, it is possible to find several examples in literature involving cyanoarenes, flavins, xanthenes, thiazines, and many other derivatives. 12 However, only a limited number of them has been merged to metal catalysts for metallaphotocatalysis.Starting from the earliest developments of organic photoredox catalysis, several classes of organic dyes have been used to promote light-mediated processes.

        <p>Organic dyes are usually characterized by closed-shell ground electronic configuration, so that the ground state has a singlet spin multiplicity (S0), and the excited states are either singlets (S1, S2, etc.) or triplets (T1, T2, etc.) (see a representative Jablonski diagram in Figure 1).

        <p>Absorption (ABS) bands correspond to electronic transitions between states of the same spin multiplicity, i.e. S0-Sn transitions. The lowest-energy triplet excited state (T1) can be populated by a non-radiative process, named intersystem crossing (ISC) from the S1 excited state. This ISC process is expected to be efficient when a) heavy atoms are present; 26 b) the energy difference between the involved electronic states is low; c) the configuration of electronic states involved is different (El-Sayed rules). The excited state lifetime (t) of the organic dye represents a crucial parameter when a bimolecular quenching process takes place in the photocatalytic cycle. Lifetime (t) of excited states can vary from 10 -10 -10 -8 s for S1 to 10 -6 -10 -3 s for T1 in fluid solution. The quenching constant can be evaluated by the Stern-Volmer plot, measuring the lifetime of the photoreactive excited state of the photocatalyst as a function of the quencher concentration. 2,3 Most of the metallaphotocatalysis processes are based on photoinduced electron transfer reactions and are thus named metallaphotoredox catalysis. The electronically excited states are better oxidant and better reductant compared to the ground state species. Therefore, electron transfer reactions that are endoergonic in the dark become exoergonic upon light excitation of the organic photosensitizer (PS). The photoinduced electron transfer reactions are always single electron transfer processes, and the redox potentials of excited states can be evaluated according to the following equations: E 0 (PS •+ /*PS) = E 0 (PS •+ /PS) -[E00(*PS/PS)/F] (1) E 0 (*PS/PS •-) = E 0 (PS/PS •-) + [E00(*PS/PS)/F] (Absorption (ABS) bands correspond to electronic transitions between states of the same spin multiplicity, i.e. S0-Sn transitions.

        <p>It is important to underline that these equations are valid only for reversible electron transfer processes. When the electron transfer process is coupled to a chemical reaction, the evaluation of the thermodynamics is much more complicated. The yields of the desired organic reactions are influenced not only by the efficiency of the electron transfer (eT) step, but also by the stability of the generated radical species and the kinetics of competitive reactions. Moreover, when designing a photoredox reaction, it is important to remember that, after photoinduced electron transfer, the photosensitizer needs to be restored to its initial oxidation state before starting a new catalytic cycle. This can be done by a sacrificial reagent or by an organic substrate, provided they have the proper redox potentials (Figure 2,A). For the sake of comparison, all the redox potentials need to be referred to the same standard electrode, e.g., standard calomel electrode (SCE). An alternative mechanism to photoinduced electron transfer is energy transfer from the photosensitizer to the metal-based catalyst (Figure 2, B). 25 The rate of energy transfer is dependent on different parameters correlated to Coulombic or exchange mechanism, 2,3 but, in all cases, it is required that the excited state of the photosensitizer lies at higher energy than the excited state of the metal-based catalyst to be populated.It is important to underline that these equations are valid only for reversible electron transfer processes.

        <p>Dicyanobenzene derivatives were first reported by Adachi in 2012 as novel materials for light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) 26 . These dyes are characterized by a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) as a result of the very small energy gap between their singlet and triplet excited states. In fact, when the S1-T1 splitting is small (ΔE ca. 100 meV for this class of molecules), reverse intersystem crossing from T1 to S1 is possible at room temperature. The triplet state is long-lived and delayed fluorescence follows the triplet state population. The molecular design of dicyanobenzene derivatives is critical to have both a small S1-T1 energy splitting and a high fluorescence decay rate. The latter property is highly desired in OLED materials, since it ensures a high luminescence quantum yield, but is not strictly necessary in photoredox catalysis. In order to fulfill the above-mentioned criteria for the realization of a molecule presenting TADF, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of these dyes must be localized on the donor and acceptor moieties, respectively, leading to a charge transfer transition characterized by small ΔES1-T1. This goal has been reached, for example, by coupling electron donating carbazolyl units to an electron accepting dicyanobenzene unit. In the case of 4CzIPN (2,4,5,6-tetra(9H-carbazol-9yl)isophthalonitrile (PS-I, Figure 3), it is possible to populate its lowest excited state by irradiation with blue light (absorbance onset in MeCN at 470 nm and molar absorption coefficient of ca. 20000 M -1 cm -1 at 375 nm) and an emission can be detected at 539 nm. 27 This emission has a monoexponential decay in aerated solutions (t = 12.7 ns in MeCN, prompt fluorescence 27 ) but shows a biexponential decay in degassed solutions. The second mentioned decay occurs in the range of microseconds and depends on the concentration of molecular oxygen and temperature, as is typical of delayed fluorescence. Thanks to the localized nature of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, the electrochemical properties of this class of dyes are strongly dependent on those of the parent electron donating and electron accepting units. Moreover, one advantage of the use of TADF-displaying dyes is that the E00 used to determine the excited state redox potentials is that of the singlet state, and therefore the loss of excitation energy is minimized. For example, for PS-I E(PS •+ /PS) is +1.49 V and E(PS/PS • ¯) is -1.24 V, and considering E00 = 2.67 eV, E(PS •+ /*PS)= -1.18 V and E(*PS/PS •-)= +1.43 V (vs. SCE in MeCN). 27 A different dicyanobenzene derivative that has been used in metallaphotocatalysis is 3DPAFIPN (2,4,6-tris(diphenylamino)-5-fluoroisophthalonitrile (PS-II, Figure 3). The photophysical properties of this dye are largely similar to those of PS-I. However, the presence of a halogen atom directly bonded to the core of the molecule and the presence of the better electron-donating diphenyl amino moiety instead of carbazole determine a lowering both for the reduction or the oxidation potentials. 27 By choosing the appropriate electron donating and electron accepting units, it is therefore possible to tune the redox potentials of dicyanobenzene derivatives to meet those requested from the desired reaction.Dicyanobenzene derivatives were first reported by Adachi in 2012 as novel materials for light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) 26 .

        <p>One of the most interesting features of this class of compounds is that the triplet state that arises from the pàp* electronic transition can lie below or very close in energy to the singlet state that arises from the nàp* transition. Thanks to El-Sayed rules, 3 intersystem crossing between these two states is very fast and the long-lived triplet excited state can be efficiently populated. In this context, the most representative example is benzophenone (PS-IV, Figure 4). Its absorption spectrum presents one weaker band at 350 nm, resulted from the symmetry-forbidden nàp* transition, and a stronger one at 250 nm, derived from the allowed pàp* transition. The emission spectrum is characterized by two bands, as well: the most intense one is the phosphorescence in the range of 400-550 nm and a weak tail on the high energy side is due to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. In a rigid matrix at 77K, the triplet state has a lifetime of 10 -3 s. 28 The efficiency of the ISC is unitary with a quantum yield associated to the population of the triplet excited state of 100%. 3 The reduction potentials of carbonyl compounds are generally quite negative, which implies that, if reduced, these photosensitizers are good reductants: in the case of PS-IV, E(PS/PS • ¯) is -1.83 V vs. SCE in MeCN. 29 Recently, a derivative of benzophenone bearing an electron withdrawing group on one phenyl ring and an electron donating one on the other one has been utilized as a photosensitizer. 30 This compound has a higher absorption at 350 nm but still suffers from the drawback of absorbing UV light exclusively. Thioxanthone (PS-VII, Figure 4) has also been utilized in metallaphotoredox catalysis. 31 Its molar absorption coefficient is significantly higher compared to that of PS-IV and its lowest absorption band is slightly red-shifted. 31 However, this sensitizer still fails at absorbing visible light.One of the most interesting features of this class of compounds is that the triplet state that arises from the pàp* electronic transition can lie below or very close in energy to the singlet state that arises from the nàp* transition.

        <p>Acridinium ions can be linked to a mesityl unit, as in Mes-Acr + (PS-IX, Figure 5), to form a chromophore in which mesitylene is the electron donating group and acridinium the electron-accepting one. Upon photoexcitation with blue light, a charge transfer (CT) state (Mes + -Acr • ) can be efficiently populated. This state is then able to recombine to populate the triplet excited state T1, localized on the acridinium moiety and displaying a lifetime of 5.3 ms at 77 K. 32 In recent years, the study and use of acridinium dyes has been extended significantly. Nicewicz has investigated the use of acridinium derivative PS-X (Figure 5) in photoredox catalysis. 33 If PS-X's charge transfer state is quenched by a sacrificial electron donor, Mes-Acr • is formed and can be used as a potent reductant. The potential related to the oxidation of Mes-Acr • to PS-X, E(PS/PS • ¯), is -0.60 V vs. SCE in MeCN. On top of that, Mes-Acr • is colored with an absorption band between 450 and 550 nm in MeCN. Consequently, upon visible photoexcitation the reduced Mes-Acr • dye can reach an excited state whose oxidation potential, E(PS/*PS • ¯), is -2.91 V vs. SCE (in MeCN), 35 making Mes-Acr • 's reducing strength similar to that of alkali metals. However, the excited state of Mes-Acr • is a doublet (D1) characterized by an extremely short lifetime (ca. 100 ps). 33 Consequently, its ability to promote photoredox reactions by bimolecular quenching mechanisms is highly disfavored: for example, in the case of diffusion-controlled processes with kq = 10 10 M -1 s -1 , a quencher concentration of 0.1 M is required for a 10% quenching efficiency. Therefore, ground-state interactions between Mes-Acr • and the reaction partner are most likely responsible of the quenching process.Acridinium ions can be linked to a mesityl unit, as in Mes-Acr + (PS-IX, Figure 5), to form a chromophore in which mesitylene is the electron donating group and acridinium the electron-accepting one.

        <p>Among xanthene derivatives, Eosin Y (PS-XIII, Figure 6) is the most commonly used in metallaphotoredox catalysis. This class of dyes is characterized by a strong absorption in the green region of the visible spectrum and, for example, PS-XIII has a molar absorption coefficient of 121000 M -1 cm -1 at 542 nm. 34 Compared to the previously described classes of photosensitizers, it is therefore possible to use less energetic electromagnetic radiation for its excitation. Moreover, it is also possible to efficiently populate the triplet state of xanthene derivatives favoring the ISC process upon functionalization of their chromophore core with heavy halogen atoms (heavy atom effect). In the case of PS-XIII, the quantum yield for the population of the triplet state is 33% and its lifetime is 1.7 µs (in EtOH). 35 The reduction and oxidation potentials for this photosensitizer are modest compared with the previously described dyes and are, respectively, -1.14 and +0.72 V vs. SCE (in MeOH). 36 In Rose Bengal (PS-XIV, Figure 6), where the xanthene derivative bearing four iodine atoms around the core, ISC is even more favored and therefore the triplet state quantum yield is 61% (in EtOH). 35Among xanthene derivatives, Eosin Y (PS-XIII, Figure 6) is the most commonly used in metallaphotoredox catalysis.

        <p>In 2016 a remarkable work reported carbazolyl cyanobenzenes (CDCBs) as a class of organic dyes in photoredox/Ni dual catalytic C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ) cross-coupling reactions. Zhang 37 and, successively Zeitler 27 have introduced a number of modification in the framework, by introducing halogens or changing the number and position of carbazolyl and cyano groups attached to the aromatic core. Cyanobenzene derivatives, and in particular PS-I (4CzIPN, Figure 3), have been extensively used in metallaphotoredox catalysis for two main reasons: a) the modification of the donor (carbazole or diphenylamine units) and acceptor (dicyanobenzene ring) groups can simply alter the oxidation and reduction potential, both in the ground and in the excited state; b) E00 can be simply modulated by these substituents; c) reversible voltammetric curves have been registered for these derivatives, highlighting the stability and reversibility of the different redox states of the PS.In 2016 a remarkable work reported carbazolyl cyanobenzenes (CDCBs) as a class of organic dyes in photoredox/Ni dual catalytic C(sp 3 )-C(sp 2 ) cross-coupling reactions.

        <p>For example, substituting one carbazole unit with a halogen substituent (PSIII, 3CzClIPN,Figure 3, it was possible to alter E(PS •+ /PS), which was increased from +1.49 V to +1.79 V (vs. SCE). 27 On the other hand, introducing EDG substituent on the carbazole ring (MeO groups) it was possible to modify the E(PS •+ /*PS) from -1.18 V to -1.5 V vs. SCE. 27 In addition, the compounds are obtained by simple nucleophilic reactions (one step, in most cases), and further synthetic modifications are possible. 39 Not surprisingly these derivatives found a wide use in metal photoredox processes, in particular in nickel mediated reactions. Although the photoredox cycles in nickel mediated reaction is still under investigation 17 and different oxidation states of Ni are involved. 40 In order to form nickel catalyst in low oxidation state it is necessary a strong negative reduction potential of the photosensitizer in the fundamental state (E(PS/PS •-), where a reductive quenching is operative. In the case where an oxidative quenching is the photochemical event, an excited state oxidation potential of the photocatalyst E(PS •+ /*PS) close to -1.2 v vs. SCE has to be provided. From many examples reported in the examined literature, it seems that the value of -1.2 v is generally obtained after a reductive quenching of the excited state of the organic photosensitizer, generating PS •-. Therefore, in many reported processes as discussed, the value of E(*PS/PS •-) and E(PS/PS •-) needs to be tuned for a successful catalytic cycle. Zhang remarked that PS-I was both a strong oxidant and reductant in the excited state (E(*PS/PS As in the case of the Ir(III)-mediated process, 4CzIPN presents a sufficient reduction potential in its excited state to generate the organic radical from the organic sp 3 precursor [E(*PS/PS •-)&gt; +1.10 V vs. SCE]. After the electron transfer, the *PS is reductively quenched generating PS •-. The so-formed species is able to reduce the metal catalyst, forming a species of nickel in low oxidation state. Other organic dyes such as Eosin Y (PS-XIII), Rose Bengal (PS-XIV), methylene blue, and Mes-Acr + (PS-IX) showed no activity, probably due to the lack of appropriate potentials. Molander reported in the same year 42 a Ni/photoredox dual catalytic crosscoupling employing (hetero)aryl bromides 1 with 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHP) 6 as source of C-centered radicals (Scheme 1, C), employing PS-I as active photoredox catalyst in this case as well. As often noted in sp 3 nickel coupling, the methodology is not suitable for primary alkyl or cyclopropyl derivatives, where the absence of the desired coupling product was observed. The process is promoted by a SET, via reductive quenching of the *PS. This yields the corresponding PS •-, a strong reductant that is able to reduce the nickel in right oxidation state. Alkylsilicates 43 were also employed in the presence of PS-I in cross coupling reactions promoted by nickel. 44 The mechanism is analogous to the one observed for 1,4-dihydropyridines and acid derivatives. The SET occurs between the excited state of the photosensitizer (*PS).For example, substituting one carbazole unit with a halogen substituent (PSIII, 3CzClIPN,Figure 3, it was possible to alter E(PS •+ /PS), which was increased from +1.49 V to +1.79 V (vs. SCE). 27 On the other hand, introducing EDG substituent on the carbazole ring (MeO groups) it was possible to modify the E(PS •+ /*PS) from -1.18 V to -1.5 V vs. SCE. 27 In addition, the compounds are obtained by simple nucleophilic reactions (one step, in most cases), and further synthetic modifications are possible. 39 Not surprisingly these derivatives found a wide use in metal photoredox processes, in particular in nickel mediated reactions.

        <p>As an example of the fine tuning of the organic photosensitizer, Molander reported the synthesis of diverse flavanones 9 by coupling novel 2-trifluoroboratochromanone 8 with aryl and heteroaryl bromide 1. 45 While Eosin Y (PS-XIII) and acridinium (PS-IX) were not able to promote the reaction, PS-I was found a productive sensitizer (Scheme 2).As an example of the fine tuning of the organic photosensitizer, Molander reported the synthesis of diverse flavanones 9 by coupling novel 2-trifluoroboratochromanone 8 with aryl and heteroaryl bromide 1. 45 While Eosin Y (PS-XIII) and acridinium (PS-IX) were not able to promote the reaction, PS-I was found a productive sensitizer (Scheme 2).</p>

Synthesis of flavanones via photoredox/Ni dual catalyzed α-arylation/heteroarylation of 2-trifluoroboratochromanones. 45 Eosin Y (PS-XIII) has an insufficient potential (E(*PS/PS •-)) to promote the oxidation of trifluoroboratochromanone 8, while the reduction potential (E(PS/PS •-)) of Mes-Acr + PS-IX is not sufficiently low for the nickel reduction. Wang and Mariano described a formylation reaction of aryl halides, aryl triflates, and vinyl bromides under photoredox synergistic nickel catalysis, promoted by PS-I. 46 The formylation takes advantage of the simple oxidation of diethoxyacetic acid mediated by the excited state of PS-I. The process can be directly applied to the synthesis of aromatic aldehydes bearing different functional groups. The incorporation of Cglycosides in drug design was considered by Molander,47 who described the preparation of C-acyl glycosides 12 through a Ni/photoredox dual catalytic processes, again using PS-I as photosensitizer (Scheme 3, A). 1,4-Dihydropyridines 11 were employed as glycosyl radical precursor, generated by reductive quenching of the excited state of the PS. In order to have direct access to acyl derivatives, in situ activated carboxylic acids 10 by dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) were selected as reaction partners. DMDC was chosen to be employed after an intense experimentation and evaluation of activating different agents. Although a mechanistic picture was not provided, the reaction is probably occurring via formation of an acylnickel intermediate that is intercepted by the glycosyl radical to form the corresponding Ni(III) intermediate, leading to the observed product after reductive elimination. DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology is widely used in pharmaceutical industries 48 and in order to expand the diversity within the sp 3 functionalization, photoredox catalysis can be the right tool. In fact, Molander 49 has reported the possibility of merging Ni/photoredox dual catalysis in useful C(sp 2 )-C(sp 3 ) cross-coupling as well as photoredox-catalyzed radical/polar crossover alkylation protocols with DELs. One of the major problems associated with these compounds is the poor solubility of the modified DNA molecules. The use of high dilution and excess of the reagents (40-1000 equiv.) solved this problem. Pre-catalysts and additives were important reaction parameters to consider in this chemistry. 4CzIPN (PS-I) was found to be the most suitable photosensitizer, considering the redox potential (E(DHP •+ /DHP) = +1.10 vs. SCE) necessary to generate an alkyl radical from alkyl 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs) and acids derivatives, employed as alkyl radical source. Various aryl or heteroaryl halides were bonded via amide bonds to DNA, to accomplish the desired couplings. Katritzky salts 13, formed via a simple condensation of the corresponding primary amines with a bench-stable, commercially available triphenylpyrylium was used as suitable precursor alkyl radicals, in various cross coupling reactions. 50 Katritzky salts, indeed, form alkyl radicals via a single electron reduction process 58a and subsequent fragmentation. Molander reported a cross-electrophilic coupling via Katritzky salts 13 47b (Scheme 3, B) with a Ni/photoredox dual catalysis. 4CzIPN (PS-I) was employed as photosensitizer in this dual process, in this case. However, the mechanism was found to be slightly different compared with the previously mentioned ones. Stern-Volmer experiments confirmed that the excited state of the photosensitizer is reductively quenched by triethylamine, the sacrificial reagent. The excited state of the PS has a sufficiently negative reduction potential (E(*PS/PS •-)= +1.35 V vs. SCE) to oxidize triethylamine (E(A •+ /A)= +1.0 V vs. SCE). 51 The quenching event generates PS Mechanistically, the reaction is determined by the formation of reduced Ni(0), capable of giving oxidative addition with the aryl iodides. In situ generated hydriodic acid promotes the aziridine opening to the corresponding iodoamine. The iodo derivatives through a SET event followed by fragmentation, mediated by various possible precursors ([dtbbpy]Ni(I) complex or PS -), intercepted by Ni(II) complex. In the above-mentioned example reported by Doyle the possibility -arising from the reversible radical generation -of performing a HAT catalytic cycle was disclosed. This has been clearly shown by Paixão and König, that recently reported a C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ) cross-coupling of alkyl bromides and alkyl chlorides 18 with ethers 19 by dual photoredox/nickel catalysis promoted by PS-I (Scheme 6). 55 Scheme 6. C(sp 3 )-C(sp 3 ) cross-coupling of alkyl bromides and chlorides with ethers by dual photoredox/Ni catalysis promoted by 4CzIPN. 55 The mechanistic proposal followed the previous discussions, with alkyl bromide undergoing an oxidative addition on the Ni(0) complex to give a Ni(II)-alkyl halide complex. As pointed out in the several examples here illustrated, the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) is supposed to occur via SET from the reduced photosensitizer (PS Br radical in a facile manner. At this point the electrophilic bromine radical can behave as HAT agent and is capable of abstracting hydrogen atom from species with low BDE in the reaction mixture. Due to the presence of ethers, the abstraction of the hydrogen atom from the carbon adjacent oxygen is favored. The formation of a carbon-centered radical in α position to oxygen is followed to the addition to Ni(II) generating Ni(III) intermediate, that gave the observed compounds after reductive elimination. The conditions required for the Ni(II)/photoredox catalyzed coupling in the presence of organic dyes can allow the possible preparation of useful chiral intermediates, such as enantioenriched allyl carbamates 22. 56 Starting from chiral 1-bromo-alken-3-ol derivatives 21, it is possible to alkylate alkylbromides 18 bearing different functional groups (e.g. CN, Ar, epoxide, Cl, Bpin, OTHP, SO2Ph, alkyne, COOR, Ph) in high chemoselective manner (Scheme 7).Scheme 2.

        <p>Although the combination of photoredox catalysis with enantioselective transformation is quite challenging, pioneering examples have been recently reported, and will certainly attract more work in the future. 60 Chiral Ni(III) intermediate surrounded by appropriate ligand can give, due to the reversibility of the radical addition, several advantages compared with other metals to construct stereoselective transformations. 61 A few interesting examples of stereoselective processes in which PS-I was employed as active organic dye in a stereoselective process were recently reported. Doyle and Rovis groups presented the asymmetric Ni-catalyzed desymmetrization of mesosuccinic anhydrides 27 using benzyltrifluoroborates 4 as the alkyl radical source, in the presence of PS-I as organic photosensitizer (Scheme 10, A). 62 Scheme 10. (A) Ni/photoredox-catalyzed desymmetrization of meso-succinic anhydrides; (B) Ni/photoredox-catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross-coupling of a-chloro esters with aryl iodides. 62 Photophysical studies provided the evidence that an oxidative addition process occurred before the radical addition to a Ni(II) intermediate. The above-mentioned results can be justified due to the fact that the process is energetically favored. One drawback is related to the use of sensitive Ni(COD)2 as pre-catalysts. Walsh and Mao 63 employed PS-I as photosensitizer, in the presence of Hantzsch ester (HE) as the terminal organic reductant for a catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross-coupling of a-chloro esters 29 with aryl iodides 1 for the simple and effective preparation of a-aryl esters 30 (Scheme 10, B). The chiral ligand used for the transformation is a quite simple and readily available modified bisoxazoline (BiOX) (L4, Scheme 10). According to the mechanistic proposal LNi(II) complex, formed in situ, is reduced to LNi(0) by the PS •-which is previously obtained by reductive quenching of the PS-I by the sacrificial Hantzsch's ester (HE). The reduction of the chloroester and the concomitant formation of the corresponding stabilized a-radical species can be carried out by different reductants (the oxidized HE, the LNi(I) complex or the PS •-) and the authors cannot make a distinction or have evidence for conclude which process is favoured.

Here, the thioxanthone is acting as triplet state photosensitizer of oxygen, forming singlet oxygen. This species is capable of oxidizing the ketoester into the corresponding hydroxy dicarbonyl compounds. Finally, Davidson and Bonifazi have described an enantioselective synthesis of N-benzylic heterocycles from stabilized carboxylic acids using an organic photosensitizer and a chiral pyridine-oxazoline ligand (L6, Scheme 11, B) again employing PS-I. 64. α-heterocyclic carboxylic acids 33 were used as precursor of radicals in a decarboxylative strategy.Although the combination of photoredox catalysis with enantioselective transformation is quite challenging, pioneering examples have been recently reported, and will certainly attract more work in the future. 60 Chiral Ni(III) intermediate surrounded by appropriate ligand can give, due to the reversibility of the radical addition, several advantages compared with other metals to construct stereoselective transformations. 61 A few interesting examples of stereoselective processes in which PS-I was employed as active organic dye in a stereoselective process were recently reported.

(A) Ni/photoredox-catalyzed desymmetrization of meso-succinic anhydrides; (B) Ni/photoredox-catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross-coupling of a-chloro esters with aryl iodides. 62 Photophysical studies provided the evidence that an oxidative addition process occurred before the radical addition to a Ni(II) intermediate. The above-mentioned results can be justified due to the fact that the process is energetically favored. One drawback is related to the use of sensitive Ni(COD)2 as pre-catalysts. Walsh and Mao 63 employed PS-I as photosensitizer, in the presence of Hantzsch ester (HE) as the terminal organic reductant for a catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross-coupling of a-chloro esters 29 with aryl iodides 1 for the simple and effective preparation of a-aryl esters 30 (Scheme 10, B). The chiral ligand used for the transformation is a quite simple and readily available modified bisoxazoline (BiOX) (L4, Scheme 10). According to the mechanistic proposal LNi(II) complex, formed in situ, is reduced to LNi(0) by the PS •-which is previously obtained by reductive quenching of the PS-I by the sacrificial Hantzsch's ester (HE). The reduction of the chloroester and the concomitant formation of the corresponding stabilized a-radical species can be carried out by different reductants (the oxidized HE, the LNi(I) complex or the PS •-) and the authors cannot make a distinction or have evidence for conclude which process is favoured. Xiao designed a chiral BOX ligand linked to a thioxanthone moiety (L5, Scheme 11, A) to carry out an aerobic oxidation of keto esters and ketoamides 31. 60b Scheme 11. (A) Enantioselective aerobic asymmetric oxidation of β-ketoesters via chiral Ni-catalyst complex; (B) enantioselective Ni/photoredox cross-coupling arylation of αheterocyclic carboxylic acids. 64 The proposed mechanism for this stereoselective transformation, is different from the ones reported so far. Here, the thioxanthone is acting as triplet state photosensitizer of oxygen, forming singlet oxygen. This species is capable of oxidizing the ketoester into the corresponding hydroxy dicarbonyl compounds. Finally, Davidson and Bonifazi have described an enantioselective synthesis of N-benzylic heterocycles from stabilized carboxylic acids using an organic photosensitizer and a chiral pyridine-oxazoline ligand (L6, Scheme 11, B) again employing PS-I. 64. α-heterocyclic carboxylic acids 33 were used as precursor of radicals in a decarboxylative strategy.</p>
        <p>To conclude this section about the use of PS-I a particular mention goes to the application of organic photosensitizers in activation of CO2 with dual catalysis. The ability to reduce CO2 and transform this inactive molecule in a reagent is coupled with nickel for the incorporation of activated CO2 in organic molecules.

        <p>The reduction by PS •-of the Ni(II)-neocuproine complex take place step-wise to give two species [NI(I) and Ni(0)]. The neocuproine-Ni(0) interacts with the bromides via oxidative addition and forms the LNiBrR species. These can be further reduced to the corresponding LNi(I)R intermediates. At this stage, the interaction with CO2 takes place, forming the LNi(III)R(CO2) complex that, after reductive elimination, gives the observed carboxylate. König, in a successive study 66 described the carbonylation of styrene derivatives, and how the reaction can be controlled by ligands on the nickel complex. The ligand-controlled Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of styrenes was performed in the presence on Ni(II) and PS-I, under visible light irradiation. The Markovnikov product (a-benzyl carboxylates) was obtained with cuproine, while with 1,4-bis-(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) as ligand the anti-Markovnikov product was isolated. A variety of differently substituted styrene derivative by electron rich or poor substituents can be employed in the process. Mechanistically, the reaction is intriguing. The employment of HE ester is crucial because, by decomposition, a proton is formed. This proton can react with the Ni(0) complex, affording the corresponding nickel hydride. Hydrometallation of the styrene by the HNi(I)L is responsible for the formation of the nickel complexes involved in the transformation, in the case of Markovnikov product. The anti Markovnikov product is due to the ability of the phosphine ligand to allow the direct coordination of CO2 to the Ni(0) complex, followed by insertion of styrene.

        <p>As specified in our simplified introduction aryl ketones can be excited via an n→π* excitation process, that rapidly interconverts the sensitizer into a triplet state. This state is able to mediate eT reactions and, at the same time can mediate HAT reactions. 67 Murakami reported the direct homocoupling of arylbromides promoted by catalytic amount of thioxanthone in the presence of Ni(II), dtbbpy (4,4ʹ-di-tert-butyl-2,2ʹ-bipyridine) as a ligand and using Et(iPr)2N as sacrificial reductant. 68 The thioxanthone receives an electron in its excited state from Et(iPr)2N, forming the reduced ketyl radical anion. The radical anion is able to reduce Ni(II) to Ni(0) complex. The Ni(0) complex is able to engage in an oxidative addition with aryl bromide giving LArNi(II)Br. Disproportion of Ni(II) complex was evoked to explain the formation of Ni(II)Ar2, followed by reductive elimination.

The structure of the ketone photosensitizer was optimized, and the compound PS-V was found to be the most effective PS for the reaction. Inexpensive and simple 5,5'-dimethyl-2,2'bipyridine was the ligand employed in the study. The reaction used mainly different cyclic and acyclic ethers 19 as starting materials, due to the low dissociation energies (BDEs) of the C-H bond close to the oxygen atom, although examples of employment of cyclohexane was also included. Mechanistic studies were quite informative. Deuteration studies excluded the formation of bromine radical from Ni(II) complexes. The isolated ArNi(II)Br complexes were found to give the desired product if irradiated and only in the presence of the ketone PS. Finally, electronic spin resonance (EPR) spectra shown the presence in the reaction mixture of Ni(I) complexes and ketyl radical. All data together are pointing to a mechanism in which the triplet state of the photosensitizer generates a radical from the substrate by HAT and the so-formed ketyl radical is able to reduce the Ni(II)(acac)2 complex used in the transformation to a Ni(0) form. Then the reaction proceeds via oxidative addition of the LNi(0) complex to bromide derivative to form the corresponding LRNi(II)Br complex, which is able to intercept the radical organic species formed by HAT. The final step is the reductive elimination, with re-generation of Ni(I) that closes the catalytic cycle. By taking advantage of the mentioned HAT ability of ketyl radical anion, two synthesis of ketones were described. König reported a dual catalytic arylation of aromatic aldehydes with aryl bromides using UV-irradiation and a nickel catalyst. 69 Formation of the acyl radical is determined by a HAT reaction between the ketyl radical anion of the photosensitizer and the aromatic aldehydes. Dewanji and Rueping reported 70 the preparation of unsymmetrical ketones 42 by a nickel dual catalytic system (Scheme 13, B). The direct benzylic C-H acylation of toluene, methylbenzene or other similar derivatives 39 was possible in the presence of different acid chlorides 40 and anhydrides 41. The mechanism is quite close to the previously discussed. The only difference encountered is related to the in situ formed LNi(0) (L = dtbbpy).

Generation of species able to perform an HAT process, was responsible for the formation of the allyl radical. The bromine radical was formed upon energy transfer from the *PS to the ArNi(II)Br species. The obtained *[ArNi(II)Br] species is fragmented in Br radical and Ni(I).

Application of Co/photoredox catalysis in the (A) isomerization of alkenes and (B) hydroalkynylation for the synthesis of 1,3-enynes. 79,81 The obtainment of the more or less substituted alkenes is a function of the ligand employed. Utilizing Xantphos (L7, Scheme 18, A) as the ligand, the most stable isomers were obtained, while isomerizing terminal alkenes over one position were selectively formed by using DPEphos (L8, Scheme 18, A) as the ligand. The scope of the reaction was excellent, and the yields were in general quite high, employing both the described conditions. The mechanistic picture proposed for the reaction considers the excited state of PS-I (Figure 3) reductively quenched by HE. The so-formed PS •-state can reduce Co(II) to Co(I). On the other hand, HE is also a strong reductant in its excited state [E(*HE/HE •+ ) = -2.28 V vs. SCE]. 80 and it is not excluded that excited HE ester can donate electrons to cobalt. Co(I) is surrounded by phosphines present in the reaction mixture and it is transformed in LCo(III)H hydride complex by reaction with H + (H + is derived by decomposition of HE ester after the first reductive events). Reaction of the LCo(III)H complex with alkene forms the corresponding LCo(III)alkyl complex. The isomerization occurs by b-hydride elimination, probably facilitated by irradiation of the reaction mixture. An interesting photochemical hydroalkynylation for the synthesis of 1,3-enynes in good to high yields was described recently by Collins 81 using cobalt catalysis and PS-I (Scheme 18, B). Remarkably, it was possible to apply the reaction to macrocyclic hydroalkynylations, a class of motive present in natural products. The mechanistic interpretation of the obtained results is slightly different from the other discussed examples with cobalt. In this case the SET event was carried out by the photosensitizer in its excited state. The *PS was supposed to be able to reduce, in a consecutive manner, the LCo(II) (L= chelating phosphine) to the LCo(0) complex. Insertion of the alkyne gave an intermediate LCo(II)H(C≡CR) complex. This complex was then involved in a migratory insertion, resulting in the formation of an ene-ine Co(II)H. Oxidation of this complex to a new LCo(III)H(ene-ine) was proposed to occur via SET from the oxidized photosensitizer PS •+ . At this point, a reductive elimination forms a LCo(I) complex, that re-enters in the catalytic cycle, and the observed product is formed.

Mechanistically, the reaction is initiated by the oxidation of the organic electron-rich aromatic substrates employed 66, leading to the corresponding radical cation due to *PS. Then P(OR)3 67 acts as a nucleophile and the so-formed radical is reduced by Co(III) to the arenium, forming a Co(II) species.Lei and co-workers reported a dual cobalt [Co(dmgH)(dmgH2)]Cl2 photoredox approach to phosphorylated products in the presence of acridinium PS-VIII as photosensitizer (Scheme 19, A). 82 The high oxidative ability of acridinium in its excited state is necessary, as other tested organic photosensitizers were unable to promote the reaction.

The so-formed alkyl radical is trapped by the Co(II) complex (cobaloxime) to form a Co(III)alkyl, that through HAT is furnishing CoIII hydride and the desired alkene.

The authors, on the basis of DFT calculations, suggested a Pd(0)-Pd(II)-Pd(III)-Pd(I)-Pd(0) pathway. The abstraction of the hydrogen from an aldehyde is determined by the excited anthraquinone (*PS-VIII), with the generation of an anthraquinone radical (PS-VIII •-).

By studying the reaction profile, authors found that the base abstracts a Br atom from the Pd(I)-Br complex and a proton from AQ-H radical in a concerted manner. This step regenerates the Pd(0) catalyst. The Pd(0) surrounded by the ligand reacts with aryl bromide in the usual manner (i.e. oxidative addition), leading to ArPd(II)Br.

        <p>Copper has been under active investigations for photoredox application from several points of view. 18 Copper can be used for the preparation of quite effective and tunable photocatalysts. The employment of chiral ligands (in particular BOX ligands) allowed the possibility to use the photoredox catalyst in metal mediated processes producing effective stereoinduction. In addition, the control of the supposed Cu(I)/Cu(III) catalytic cycle for effective cross coupling can be realized through the synergistic applications of suitable photosensitizers and copper complexes. Furthermore, copper complexes are also photoactive compounds, able to reach excited states, and these properties can be advantageously introduced to control copper mediated reactions.

Therefore, the merging of dual photoredox catalysis with iron complexes is now under scrutiny.

In order to replace the expensive Ir(III) photocatalyst with an organic dye, Robert and Miyake reported the possibility of using phenoxazinebased organic photosensitizers. 100 Upon deep investigation of the mechanism, the authors proposed that the iron porphyrin is reduced to the lower oxidation state of Fe(0). All the reduction potentials of the Fe-complex, E(Fe(III)/Fe(II)), E(Fe(II)/Fe(I)) and E(Fe(I)/Fe(0)), are less negative compared to the excited state oxidation potential of the organic dye (E(PS •+ /*PS)= ca. -1.78 V vs. SCE). The interaction between the excited state of the photocatalyst and the iron complex was proven by means of Stern-Volmer analysis.

        <p>Chromium is considered a suspicious element, both toxic and dangerous. Therefore, its use in organic synthesis is avoided. Yet, recent publications remarked the low toxicity of chromium(II) and (III). 105 Chromium is used to promote effective variants of Nozaki-Hiyama-Kishi (NHK) reactions at an industrial scale. 106 However, a stoichiometric use of a reducing metal and additives is necessary for the catalytic use of chromium, thus producing waste and by-products. Photoredox catalysis could be a possible solution to avoid metals as reductant and to use light to promote the NHK reaction. A remarkable example of a photoredox NHK reaction based upon a C-H functionalization, was recently reported by Glorius. 107 The reaction is based on the formation of allylradicals from alkenes by photoredox catalysis. These radicals interact with Cr(II) to give the nucleophilic allylating Cr(III) species. The described reaction employed the iridium complex ([Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as photocatalyst. Since the reaction formed the allyl radical by reductive quenching of [Ir(III)] photocatalyst, allyl(hetero)arenes are suitable substrates for this transformation, due to their oxidation potential. The addition of the allyl Cr(II) species to aldehyde gave the desired products with good diastereoselection, controlled by a Zimmerman-Traxler transition state. Kanai and co-workers reported an enantioselective version of the reaction featuring the employment of chiral BOX ligands (L9) and acridinium salt as photocatalyst PS-IX (Scheme 27, A). 108 The use of a stronger photooxidant allowed the employment of simple alkenes 93 as starting material. Broad functional group tolerance and the possibility of utilizing aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes 80 as electrophiles make these reactions interesting. Quite recently, additional work was published in this area of research. Glorius reported a regioselective, diastereoselective, and enantioselective three-component dialkylation of substituted dienes 95 with 4alkyl-1,4-dihydropyridines 6 and aldehydes 115, for the synthesis of homoallylic alcohols 95 (Scheme 27, B). 109 The organic photocatalyst employed in the reaction is 4CzIPN (PS-I) which, once in its excited state, is reduced by the dihydropyridine derivatives (E(*PS/PS •-)= +1.35 V vs. SCE) in MeCN; E(DHP •+ /DHP)= +1.10 V vs. SCE in MeCN). PS •-is then able to reduce chromium (E(Cr(III)/Cr(II)= -0.51 V vs. SCE in dimethylformamide). The addition of radical formed by fragmentation of oxidized dihydropyridine derivatives occurred to the diene, and the so-formed allyl radical is trapped by Cr(II), giving the corresponding allylCr(III) chromium reagent.

        <p>In conclusion, application of organic dyes in metallaphotoredox catalysis is still an area that deserves better investigation and efforts. Many reactions promoted by expensive and rare Ru(II) and Ir(III) reactions can be effectively catalyzed using suitable organic dyes. Reviews and recent articles have properly assessed the photophysical properties of these dyes, facilitating a good selection and trials. In addition, several dyes are easily accessible, allowing fine tuning of their properties for more sophisticate employment. The interesting class of TADF dyes, comprising hundreds of molecules, has been investigated with only very few molecules. We believe that the association of organic dyes with metal mediated processes will attract more investigations and interesting applications in the future. Moreover, the possibility of reaching quite high reductive or oxidative excited states with multiple photons excitements, can further improve the possibilities offered by organic dyes, in more challenging and not yet explored applications, such as activation of small molecules (N2) or the catalytic use of low valent metals.In conclusion, application of organic dyes in metallaphotoredox catalysis is still an area that deserves better investigation and efforts.

        <p>Due to the difficulties related to the study of the mechanism of metallaphotoredox catalytic reactions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to gain some insight about the possible mechanistic picture. Basically, the excited state of PS-I is reductively quenched by 4-alkyl-DHP 6 to form PS •-, which is able to generate Ni(0). Interaction of Ni(0) with epoxy or aziridine moieties gives Ni(II) allyl complexes. Radical generated by fragmentation of the reduced 4-alkyl-DHP 6 interacting with Ni(II) gives the corresponding Ni(III) adduct. As reported in other calculations 53 the reaction is barrierless and reversible. This peculiar behavior is important in other mechanisms, as the radical produced in the reversible step can participate in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. Thanks to an effective reductive elimination, the desired products are formed.
