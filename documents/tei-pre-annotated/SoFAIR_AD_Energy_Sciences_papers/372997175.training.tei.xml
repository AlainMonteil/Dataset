        <p>PV/T (photovoltaic/thermal) technology is a combination of PV module (photovoltaic utilization) and collector (photothermal utilization), which can improve the comprehensive utilization efficiency of solar energy and has a broad application prospect. In this paper, PV/T module is coupled with heat pump evaporator to form a direct-expansion solar PV/T heat pump which is suitable for heat application in high latitude area. To achieve stable residential heating, a solar PV/T heat pump system coupled with build-in PCM (phase change material) heat storage is therefore proposed and simulated. Meanwhile, the mathematical model of solar PV/T heat pump coupled with build-in PCM heat storage system is established and verified. The simulation results show that the temperature of underfloor heating which using build-in PCM heat storage can reach 22 ℃ to 31 ℃ after 39 hours when the circulating water is 40 ℃. Moreover, the heating COP (Coefficient of Performance) increases with the increase of solar radiation, ambient temperature and area of PV/T collector, and decrease of wind speed, respectively. A 20 m2 PV/T panel module can output 21.4% of the electricity to power grid when the solar radiation intensity is 600 W/m2 and meet the heat demand of a 100 m2 room while maintain the operation of the system. Meanwhile, the heating COP can reach 5.79 which is 70% higher than the conventional air conditioning system and the electrical, thermal, overall efficiencies are 17.77%, 55.76% and 75.49%, respectively.PV/T (photovoltaic/thermal) technology is a combination of PV module (photovoltaic utilization) and collector (photothermal utilization), which can improve the comprehensive utilization efficiency of solar energy and has a broad application prospect.

        <p>The total amount of energy consumption in the world is constantly climbing (2019; Caetano et al., 2017). The consumption of fossil energy has brought about energy crisis and environmental crisis (Pietrosemoli and Rodríguez-Monroy, 2019). Without action, CO 2 emissions from burning fossil fuels will be doubled by 2050 (Paolo Frankl, 2010). Therefore, the development and utilization of renewable energy has become one of the effective solutions (Keček et al., 2019). Solar energy has become the first choice due to its characteristics of ubiquity, abundance and sustainability (Kuik et al., 2019;Tsai, 2015), which is mainly used in two ways: photothermal and photovoltaic. 11% of global electricity will be provided by PV by 2050 (Paolo Frankl, 2010). However, the electrical efficiency of PV cells decreases with the increase of the temperature of PV cells (Huide et al., 2017). A cooling system can be added to reduce the temperature of PV cells while the remaining heat of PV panel are absorbed by working fluid which can be employed as a useful thermal energy for heat applications in buildings.The total amount of energy consumption in the world is constantly climbing (2019; Caetano et al., 2017).

        <p>The PV/T technology coupled PV modules with thermal collectors was first proposed by Wolf et al (Wolf, 1976) to reduce PV cells temperature and improve electrical efficiency. The PV/T system can recover waste heat from the PV panel to improve comprehensive energy utilization efficiency. PV/T design optimizations are carried out to improve the system efficiency in recent years. Nahar et al.

They found that the temperature of the PV panel is reduced by 42 ℃, and the electrical efficiency is increased by 2%. Othman et al.

Their results showed that the electrical efficiency and thermal efficiency are 17% and 76%, respectively.The PV/T technology coupled PV modules with thermal collectors was first proposed by Wolf et al (Wolf, 1976) to reduce PV cells temperature and improve electrical efficiency.

        <p>Different working fluids like water, air, nanofluid and refrigerant are also used to cool the PV module. Huang and Lee (Huang and Lee, 2004) conducted long-term tests on the direct-expansion solar heat pump which adopted refrigerant as working fluid to verify the stability of the work. The total running time of their prototype is over 20000 hours, and the measured energy consumption is 0.019 kWh/l of hot water at 57 ℃ which is much less than traditional solar water heater.

In their system, the collector area is 42.5 m 2 and heat pump power is 8.4 kW, they measured that the actual indoor temperature is no less than 20 ℃ during the testing period. Alejandro Del Amo et al. (Del Amo et al., 2019) verified the feasibility of solar PV/T heat pump through experiments. They obtained that the highest COP of the system can reach 4.62. Meanwhile, the PV module provides 67.6% of the power demand, and the payback period is 6 years.Different working fluids like water, air, nanofluid and refrigerant are also used to cool the PV module.

        <p>Owing to the instability of solar energy, traditional solar PV/T system cannot continuously and stably supply heat or power generation when solar irradiation is weak such as rainy day or winter. Consequently, the market of PV/T technology compared with PV or PT system is still very low. PV/T can adapt to the characteristics of low intensity, instability and intermittency of solar energy better if it can be combined with accumulator and heat storage. However, additional space is required to install heat storage tank, which is not suitable for use in urban areas where land resources are scarce.

Then, the superheated refrigerant vapor with low pressure is compressed by the compressor to the high temperature and pressure refrigerant vapor. The condensation heat will be absorbed and stored in the build-in PCM heat storage. The heat transferred by condensation can also be used for producing domestic hot water. The liquid refrigerant will expand through the throttle valve after condensation process, and flow into the PV/T collector/evaporator.

        <p>where ∆H PCM is the latent heat of the PCM (kJ/kg). Fig. 5 shows the phase change temperature of 15 kinds of phase change materials including organic/inorganic/eutectic compounds materials. According to L.F. Cabeza et al. (Cabeza et al., 2011), the recommendation phase change temperature range for underfloor heating is between 30 °C to 40 °C. There are five kinds of PCM that have phase change temperature in this range: The ideal material should have a higher thermal conductivity and latent heat while the price is low. In order to evaluate these five materials, the graph of ideal material is also plotted in Fig. 6. The organic and eutectic compounds phase change materials have a higher price than inorganic materials while the thermal conductivity and latent heat are lower. Moreover, the larger of the overlap area in Fig. 6 between each material and ideal material, the better of the material performance. As shown in Fig. 6, Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate has the largest overlap area, thus, it is used in the simulation of build-in PCM heat storage unit. Fig. 7 illustrates the structure and cross-section view of a build-in PCM heat storage unit which is the component of underfloor heating module. The phase change materials (Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate) are placed in the outer tube of a double-wall tube which can store heat during the day and release latent heat at night. The floor temperature range of the underfloor heating is 20 ℃ to 35 ℃ for residential applications. The phase change materials should have a melting temperature lying in the practical range of operation, melt congruently with minimum subcooling and be chemically stable, low in cost, nontoxic and non-corrosive. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8(b), the outer tube of the build-in PCM heat storage is around 37 °C when the circulating water temperature is 40 °C. Thus, it is reasonable to choose a phase change material which melting point is around 37 °C. The cross-section view of the build-in heat storage unit is shown in Fig. 7(b).Polystyrene board and foam concrete are used as thermal insulation and building materials, respectively. The hot water which produced by solar PV/T heat pump module is pumped into the pipe of underfloor heating to keep the indoor temperature steady. The properties of PCM (Jankowski and McCluskey, 2014) and concrete as well as underfloor heating working conditions are listed in Table . 2. 8 (a~lc) presents the simulation results of heat transfer in build-in PCM heat storage unit at different time which carried out by software of Ansys Fluent 17.0. The thermal conductivity of the heat transfer between the coil and PCM has been considered in the setup of the boundary conditions. Thus, the boundary conditions of inner and outer tube have been set as "coupled" in Ansys Fluent 17.0 which means the solution of heat transfer process would be carried out through the coupled method in the program. The initial temperature of the heat storage unit is 15 ℃, and the underfloor heating can reach above 30 ℃ after 39 hours when the circulating water is 40 ℃. As shown in Fig. 8(md), the floor temperature increases with time and reaches 25 ℃ in the first 12 hours which has 10 ℃ difference with the ambient. The changing curve mountains rapidly in the initial stage and becomes steady after 39 hours, the build-in PCM heat storage would supply heat to indoor area and maintain the room temperature. For a typical family, the heating area is about 100 m 2 which needs about 150 meters of underfloor heating tube (circulating water tube). As shown in Fig. 9, the first 30 meters tube can arrange in the no person staying area (storage room etc.) while 30 to 110 meters tube can arrange in the short-time staying area (living room, kitchen etc.), and 110 to 150 meters tube can arrange in the long-time staying area (bedroom etc.). Therefore, when using build-in PCM heat storage as underfloor heating, the system could meet the heat demand of users and keep indoor temperature steady.where ∆H PCM is the latent heat of the PCM (kJ/kg). Fig. 5 shows the phase change temperature of 15 kinds of phase change materials including organic/inorganic/eutectic compounds materials. According to L.F. Cabeza et al. (Cabeza et al., 2011), the recommendation phase change temperature range for underfloor heating is between 30 °C to 40 °C. There are five kinds of PCM that have phase change temperature in this range: The ideal material should have a higher thermal conductivity and latent heat while the price is low. In order to evaluate these five materials, the graph of ideal material is also plotted in Fig. 6. The organic and eutectic compounds phase change materials have a higher price than inorganic materials while the thermal conductivity and latent heat are lower. Moreover, the larger of the overlap area in Fig. 6 between each material and ideal material, the better of the material performance. As shown in Fig. 6, Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate has the largest overlap area, thus, it is used in the simulation of build-in PCM heat storage unit. Fig. 7 illustrates the structure and cross-section view of a build-in PCM heat storage unit which is the component of underfloor heating module. The phase change materials (Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate) are placed in the outer tube of a double-wall tube which can store heat during the day and release latent heat at night. The floor temperature range of the underfloor heating is 20 ℃ to 35 ℃ for residential applications. The phase change materials should have a melting temperature lying in the practical range of operation, melt congruently with minimum subcooling and be chemically stable, low in cost, nontoxic and non-corrosive. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 8(b), the outer tube of the build-in PCM heat storage is around 37 °C when the circulating water temperature is 40 °C. Thus, it is reasonable to choose a phase change material which melting point is around 37 °C. The cross-section view of the build-in heat storage unit is shown in Fig. 7(b).Polystyrene board and foam concrete are used as thermal insulation and building materials, respectively. The hot water which produced by solar PV/T heat pump module is pumped into the pipe of underfloor heating to keep the indoor temperature steady.

        <p>To ensure the reliability of the mathematic model, the simulation results should be compared with the experimental results. The experimental parameters used in the simulation are listed in Table . 3. The comparison results of heating COP are presented in Fig. 11(a), the operating conditions are refer from Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 2019). Under the same system components (PV/T collector/evaporator, compressor, condenser, expansion valve, water tank), the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. Heating COP of the PV/T system increases in the first 15 minutes because the water in the tank still in the low temperature range. Thus, the temperature differences between the refrigerant fluid and water remains large in the condenser leading to a high heat transfer efficiency. However, the heat transfer efficiency of the condenser would be decreased when the temperature of the inlet water rises up during the operation of the whole system. That is the reason of the reduction of heating COP after 15 minutes. The average error of heating COP is 2.84% while the maximum error is 5.12%.

        <p>The influences of solar radiation intensity which varying from 200 W/m 2 to 1000 W/m 2 are shown as follows at the working conditions are: ambient temperature is 25 ℃, wind speed is 1.5 m/s and area of PV/T collector is 2 m 2 . Fig. 12 presents the rising curve of the heating COP and declining curves of thermal, electrical and overall efficiencies. The heating COP is 3.0 for a solar radiation of 200 W/m 2 , and it can reach up to 10.8 when the solar radiation is 1000 W/m 2 . The refrigerant evaporation temperature and pressure will be increased due to a higher temperature of PV cells. Thus, the compressor consumes less electricity to compress the refrigerant vapor leading to this upward trend. Meanwhile, the heat loss will mount due to a higher temperature difference between PV cells and ambient. Thereby, the thermal and electrical efficiencies of the PV/T panel reduce resulting in a reduction of the overall efficiency.The influences of solar radiation intensity which varying from 200 W/m 2 to 1000 W/m 2 are shown as follows at the working conditions are: ambient temperature is 25 ℃, wind speed is 1.5 m/s and area of PV/T collector is 2 m 2 .

        <p>Influence of solar radiation intensity on heating COP and thermal, electrical, overall efficiencies. Fig. 13 shows the effect of solar radiation intensity on thermal and electrical output power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant. The thermal and electrical power keep mounting with the increase of the solar radiation intensity. Meanwhile, the pressure ratio of the compressor decreases and the mass flow rate of the refrigerant increases. That is because the increase of the evaporation temperature causes a higher evaporation pressure which equals to the suction pressure of compressor leading to a lower pressure ratio. Furthermore, a larger amount of refrigerant will be needed to transfer extra heat from PV/T collector/evaporator to PCM heat exchanger (condenser) when the PV/T panel absorbs more heat from solar radiation. Fig. 13. Influence of solar radiation intensity on electrical and thermal power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant. As shown in Fig. 14, there is a positive linear correlation between PV cells' electrical power generation and solar radiation intensity while the consumption power of compressor fluctuates around 120 W. When the output power to grid is less than zero, it means the system consumes electricity from the power grid. The electrical power generated by PV panels could meet the demand of the compressor and the system could output electricity to power grid when the solar radiation intensity exceeds 500 W/m 2 .

        <p>Fig. 15 shows that increasing the ambient temperature will increase the heating COP and thermal efficiency but decrease the electrical and overall efficiencies. The temperature difference between PV cells and ambient will reduce when the ambient temperature rises leading to a less heat loss from PV/T panel to the surrounding. Thus, the heating COP increases and the electrical efficiency decreases due to a higher temperature of the PV cells while the thermal efficiency increases. However, the electrical efficiency outweighs the thermal efficiency resulting in a reduction of the overall efficiency when the ambient temperature is below 25℃. The heating COP (9.25) at 35 ℃ is higher than COP (5.79) at 15 ℃ by 59.8%, thus a higher ambient temperature is better for the system performance.Fig. 15 shows that increasing the ambient temperature will increase the heating COP and thermal efficiency but decrease the electrical and overall efficiencies.

        <p>Fig. 15. Influence of ambient temperature on heating COP and thermal, electrical, overall efficiencies. The variation curves of thermal and electrical power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant with the increase of ambient temperature are shown in Fig. 16. The changing curves of the electrical and thermal output power are the same as the electrical and thermal efficiencies. The pressure ratio of the compressor will increase when the ambient temperature is below 25 ℃ and decrease when the ambient temperature is over 25 ℃. That is because a lower ambient temperature leads to a lower superheat degree of refrigerant which cause a lower pressure ratio, and in the opposite, a higher ambient temperature leads to a higher superheat degree. Moreover, when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 ℃, it will influence the thermal efficiency of PV/T collector causing the reduction of pressure ratio. The mass flow rate of the refrigerant will keep climbing when the ambient temperature rises because less heat will lose in the ambient while more heat will be absorbed by refrigerant. Fig. 16. Influence of ambient temperature on electrical and thermal power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant. As shown in Fig. 17, the electrical power of PV decreases linearly with the ambient temperature while the consumption power of compressor decreases when the ambient temperature is below 25 ℃ and increases when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 ℃. The output power to grid reaches its maximum at 25 ℃. Because when the ambient temperature is below 25 ℃, the effect of environmental heat loss is greater than that of heat-collecting efficiency due to a large temperature difference. However, the effect of a higher ambient temperature on heat-collecting efficiency is greater than that of environmental heat loss when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 ℃. Fig. 17.

Fig. 18 shows the variation curve of heating COP, thermal, electrical and overall efficiencies with wind speed varying from 0.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s. The heating COP will decrease rapidly when the wind speed is low and steadily when the wind speed increases. More heat will be transferred to the environment and less heat is absorbed by the PV/T panel under a higher wind speed. Meanwhile, evaporation temperature of refrigerant will be decreased and the consumption power of compressor will be increased when the temperature of PV cells rises. Thus, the heating COP drops from 9.4 to 6.8, which means better wind protection measures should be taken to improve the system performance. Fig. 18.

Fig. 21 presents the influence of the area of PV/T collector on pressure ratio, heating COP and overall efficiency. Pressure ratio and overall efficiency reduce with the increase of the area, while the heating COP mounts. That is because a larger area can absorb more heat from the solar radiation, and the extra heat will be transferred by PV/T panel to refrigerant. Meanwhile, the evaporation temperature and pressure will increase leading to a lower pressure ratio and a higher heating COP. The consumption power of the compressor will decrease when the pressure ratio reduces, thus the heating COP increases more rapidly under large area conditions. A higher temperature of the PV cells causes more heat dissipates in the ambient resulting a decrease of the overall efficiency.The influences of the area of PV/T collector which varying from 1 m 2 to 3 m 2 are shown as follows at the working conditions are: solar radiation intensity is 600 W/m 2 , ambient temperature is 25 ℃ and wind speed is 1.5 m/s.

        <p>Influence of the area of PV/T collector on pressure ratio, heating COP and overall efficiency. Fig. 22 shows the declining trends of the pressure ratio and increasing trends of the thermal and electrical power influenced by the area of PV/T collector. The thermal and electrical output power are almost linearly and positively correlated with the area of PV/T collector. That is because more heat will gain from the solar radiation and be transferred to the refrigerant when the area increases. As shown in Fig. 23, the mass flow rate of refrigerant will increase when the area increases, while the consumption power of compressor will increase when the area is below 1.5 m 2 and decrease when the area is over 1.5 m 2 . The mass flow rate of refrigerant will increase because the latent heat and heat capacity of refrigerant are the same when more heat is transferred to the refrigerant. The heat absorbed by the PV/T panel and mass flow rate of refrigerant are low, thus the compressor consumes less electricity to compress the refrigerant vapor. With the increase of the area, the mass flow rate mounts resulting in an increase of consumption power. However, the pressure ratio of the compressor will reduce when the area increases over 1.5 m 2 leading to a lower consumption power.Influence of the area of PV/T collector on pressure ratio, heating COP and overall efficiency.

        <p>Nowadays, the Chinese government promotes the policy of using electricity for residential heating instead of burning coal for heating in northern China to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The solar PV/T heat pump coupled with build-in PCM heat storage system is suitable for residential heating due to its advantages: (1) high efficiency; (2) low energy consumption; (3) stable residential heating supply; (4) zero carbon emissions. Table . 4 presents the typical operating conditions and parameters of the system.

Therefore, the development and utilization of renewable energy has become one of the effective solutions (Keček et al., 2019).

        <p>where ∆H PCM is the latent heat of the PCM (kJ/kg). Fig. 5 shows the phase change temperature of 15 kinds of phase change materials including organic/inorganic/eutectic compounds materials. According to L.F. Cabeza et al. (Cabeza et al., 2011), the recommendation phase change temperature range for underfloor heating is between 30 °C to 40 °C. There are five kinds of PCM that have phase change temperature in this range: The ideal material should have a higher thermal conductivity and latent heat while the price is low. In order to evaluate these five materials, the graph of ideal material is also plotted in Fig. 6. The organic and eutectic compounds phase change materials have a higher price than inorganic materials while the thermal conductivity and latent heat are lower. Moreover, the larger of the overlap area in Fig. 6 between each material and ideal material, the better of the material performance. As shown in Fig. 6, Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate has the largest overlap area, thus, it is used in the simulation of build-in PCM heat storage unit. Fig. 7 illustrates the structure and cross-section view of a build-in PCM heat storage unit which is the component of underfloor heating module. The phase change materials (Sodium phosphate dibasic dodecahydrate) are placed in the outer tube of a double-wall tube which can store heat during the day and release latent heat at night. Polystyrene board and foam concrete are used as thermal insulation and building materials, respectively. The hot water which produced by solar PV/T heat pump module is pumped into the pipe of underfloor heating to keep the indoor temperature steady. The properties of PCM (Jankowski and McCluskey, 2014) and concrete as well as underfloor heating working conditions are listed in Table . 2. 2.5 m 3 /h Fig. 8 (a~c) presents the simulation results of heat transfer in build-in PCM heat storage unit at different time which carried out by software of

Thus, the boundary conditions of inner and outer tube have been set as "coupled" in Ansys Fluent 17.0 which means the solution of heat transfer process would be carried out through the coupled method in the program. The initial temperature of the heat storage unit is 15 ℃, and the underfloor heating can reach above 30 ℃ after 39 hours when the circulating water is 40 ℃. As shown in Fig. 8(d), the floor temperature increases with time and reaches 25 ℃ in the first 12 hours which has 10 ℃ difference with the ambient. The changing curve mountains rapidly in the initial stage and becomes steady after 39 hours, the build-in PCM heat storage would supply heat to indoor area and maintain the room temperature.

        <p>Fig. 12 presents the rising curve of the heating COP and declining curves of thermal, electrical and overall efficiencies. The heating COP is 3.0 for a solar radiation of 200 W/m 2 , and it can reach up to 10.8 when the solar radiation is 1000 W/m 2 . The refrigerant evaporation temperature and pressure will be increased due to a higher temperature of PV cells. Thus, the compressor consumes less electricity to compress the refrigerant vapor leading to this upward trend. Meanwhile, the heat loss will mount due to a higher temperature difference between PV cells and ambient. Thereby, the thermal and electrical efficiencies of the PV/T panel reduce resulting in a reduction of the overall efficiency. efficiencies. Fig. 13 shows the effect of solar radiation intensity on thermal and electrical output power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant. The thermal and electrical power keep mounting with the increase of the solar radiation intensity. Meanwhile, the pressure ratio of the compressor decreases and the mass flow rate of the refrigerant increases. That is because the increase of the evaporation temperature causes a higher evaporation pressure which equals to the suction pressure of compressor leading to a lower pressure ratio. Furthermore, a larger amount of refrigerant will be needed to transfer extra heat from PV/T collector/evaporator to PCM heat exchanger (condenser) when the PV/T panel absorbs more heat from solar radiation. Fig. 13. Influence of solar radiation intensity on electrical and thermal power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant. As shown in Fig. 14, there is a positive linear correlation between PV cells' electrical power generation and solar radiation intensity while the consumption power of compressor fluctuates around 120 W. When the output power to grid is less than zero, it means the system consumes electricity from the power grid. The electrical power generated by PV panels could meet the demand of the compressor and the system could output electricity to power grid when the solar radiation intensity exceeds 500 W/m 2 .

        <p>Fig. 15 shows that increasing the ambient temperature will increase the heating COP and thermal efficiency but decrease the electrical and overall efficiencies. The temperature difference between PV cells and ambient will reduce when the ambient temperature rises leading to a less heat loss from PV/T panel to the surrounding. Thus, the heating COP increases and the electrical efficiency decreases due to a higher temperature of the PV cells while the thermal efficiency increases. However, the electrical efficiency outweighs the thermal efficiency resulting in a reduction of the overall efficiency when the ambient temperature is below 25℃. The heating COP (9.25) at 35 ℃ is higher than COP (5.79) at 15 ℃ by 59.8%, thus a higher ambient temperature is better for the system performance.Fig. 15 shows that increasing the ambient temperature will increase the heating COP and thermal efficiency but decrease the electrical and overall efficiencies.

        <p>Fig. 15. Influence of ambient temperature on heating COP and thermal, electrical, overall efficiencies. The variation curves of thermal and electrical power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant with the increase of ambient temperature are shown in Fig. 16. The changing curves of the electrical and thermal output power are the same as the electrical and thermal efficiencies. The pressure ratio of the compressor will increase when the ambient temperature is below 25 ℃ and decrease when the ambient temperature is over 25 ℃. That is because a lower ambient temperature leads to a lower superheat degree of refrigerant which cause a lower pressure ratio, and in the opposite, a higher ambient temperature leads to a higher superheat degree. Moreover, when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 ℃, it will influence the thermal efficiency of PV/T collector causing the reduction of pressure ratio. The mass flow rate of the refrigerant will keep climbing when the ambient temperature rises because less heat will lose in the ambient while more heat will be absorbed by refrigerant. Fig. 16. Influence of ambient temperature on electrical and thermal power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant. As shown in Fig. 17, the electrical power of PV decreases linearly with the ambient temperature while the consumption power of compressor decreases when the ambient temperature is below 25 ℃ and increases when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 ℃. The output power to grid reaches its maximum at 25 ℃. Because when the ambient temperature is below 25 ℃, the effect of environmental heat loss is greater than that of heat-collecting efficiency due to a large temperature difference. However, the effect of a higher ambient temperature on heat-collecting efficiency is greater than that of environmental heat loss when the ambient temperature exceeds 25 ℃. Fig. 17.

        <p>The influences of wind speed which varying from 0.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s are shown as follows at the working conditions are: solar radiation intensity is 600 W/m 2 , ambient temperature is 25 ℃ and area of PV/T collector is 2 m 2 . Fig. 18 shows the variation curve of heating COP, thermal, electrical and overall efficiencies with wind speed varying from 0.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s. The heating COP will decrease rapidly when the wind speed is low and steadily when the wind speed increases. More heat will be transferred to the environment and less heat is absorbed by the PV/T panel under a higher wind speed. Meanwhile, evaporation temperature of refrigerant will be decreased and the consumption power of compressor will be increased when the temperature of PV cells rises. Thus, the heating COP drops from 9.4 to 6.8, which means better wind protection measures should be taken to improve the system performance. Fig. 18. Influence of wind speed on heating COP and thermal, electrical, overall efficiencies. The variation curves of thermal and electrical power, pressure ratio and mass flow rate of the refrigerant with the increase of wind speed are shown in Fig. 19. The changing curves of the thermal and electrical power have the same trend as the thermal and electrical efficiencies. Both the pressure ratio and mass flow rate of refrigerant reduce with the increase of the wind speed. That is because more heat will be absorbed by the ambient air while less heat will be transferred by the refrigerant.The influences of wind speed which varying from 0.5 m/s to 2.5 m/s are shown as follows at the working conditions are: solar radiation intensity is 600 W/m 2 , ambient temperature is 25 ℃ and area of PV/T collector is 2 m 2 .

Fig. 21 presents the influence of the area of PV/T collector on pressure ratio, heating COP and overall efficiency. Pressure ratio and overall efficiency reduce with the increase of the area, while the heating COP mounts. That is because a larger area can absorb more heat from the solar radiation, and the extra heat will be transferred by PV/T panel to refrigerant. Meanwhile, the evaporation temperature and pressure will increase leading to a lower pressure ratio and a higher heating COP. The consumption power of the compressor will decrease when the pressure ratio reduces, thus the heating COP increases more rapidly under large area conditions. A higher temperature of the PV cells causes more heat dissipates in the ambient resulting a decrease of the overall efficiency. Fig. 21. Influence of the area of PV/T collector on pressure ratio, heating COP and overall efficiency. Fig. 22 shows the declining trends of the pressure ratio and increasing trends of the thermal and electrical power influenced by the area of PV/T collector. The thermal and electrical output power are almost linearly and positively correlated with the area of PV/T collector. That is because more heat will gain from the solar radiation and be transferred to the refrigerant when the area increases. As shown in Fig. 23, the mass flow rate of refrigerant will increase when the area increases, while the consumption power of compressor will increase when the area is below 1.5 m 2 and decrease when the area is over 1.5 m 2 . The mass flow rate of refrigerant will increase because the latent heat and heat capacity of refrigerant are the same when more heat is transferred to the refrigerant. The heat absorbed by the PV/T panel and mass flow rate of refrigerant are low, thus the compressor consumes less electricity to compress the refrigerant vapor. With the increase of the area, the mass flow rate mounts resulting in an increase of consumption power. However, the pressure ratio of the compressor will reduce when the area increases over 1.5 m 2 leading to a lower consumption power. 24 illustrates the variation curve of output power to grid with the area of PV/T collector. The electrical power generated by PV panels will meet the demand of compressor when the area of PV/T collector is 2 m 2 . Moreover, the PV cells start to produce electricity to power grid when the area is over 2 m 2 which means a larger PV/T panel is better for the system performance under the same system conditions.

        <p>Nowadays, the Chinese government promotes the policy of using electricity for residential heating instead of burning coal for heating in northern China to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The solar PV/T heat pump coupled with build-in PCM heat storage system is suitable for residential heating due to its advantages: (1) high efficiency; (2) low energy consumption; (3) stable residential heating supply; (4) zero carbon emissions. Table. 4 presents the typical operating conditions and parameters of the system. It is a typical spring/autumn day in northern China. . 5 presents the simulation performance indices of the system under typical day conditions. The PV/T collector can transfer 213.9 MJ heat from the ambient to the PCM heat exchanger, and the heat will be stored in phase change materials and concrete. The build-in PCM heat storage can release the heat for 10 hours at 5.94 kW during the night while the heat loss power of 100 m 2 area is 5 kW. During autumn, winter and early spring in northern China, the heating system is necessary to keep indoor temperature above 20℃. Thus, the system can achieve the heating needs of the users and keep the indoor temperature steady. Meanwhile, the system can output 21.4% (2.79 kWh) of the power generated by PV panels to the grid while 78.6% of it consumed by the compressor. The heating COP of the system is 5.79, and the overall efficiency is 75.49%. . 6 illustrates the comparison of cost between the proposed system and conventional air conditioning system. The operating cost of the proposed system is under zero because users could sell spare electricity to power grid and get profit. Fig. 25 shows the cost variation curves of these two systems. The initial cost of the proposed system is much higher than conventional air conditioning system due to the underfloor heating equipment and PV/T panels, etc. However, the air conditioning system consumes a lot of electricity during the night for heating supply. Thus, the cost of these two systems will be the same after about 4 years, and the cost of proposed system keeps reduce while the cost of air conditioning system still climbs. Moreover, underfloor heating system which using radiative heating is more comfort and silence for users than air conditioner.Nowadays, the Chinese government promotes the policy of using electricity for residential heating instead of burning coal for heating in northern China to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The solar PV/T heat pump coupled with build-in PCM heat storage system is suitable for residential heating due to its advantages: (1) high efficiency; (2) low energy consumption; (3) stable residential heating supply; (4) zero carbon emissions. Table. 4 presents the typical operating conditions and parameters of the system. It is a typical spring/autumn day in northern China. . 5 presents the simulation performance indices of the system under typical day conditions. The PV/T collector can transfer 213.9 MJ heat from the ambient to the PCM heat exchanger, and the heat will be stored in phase change materials and concrete. The build-in PCM heat storage can release the heat for 10 hours at 5.94 kW during the night while the heat loss power of 100 m 2 area is 5 kW. During autumn, winter and early spring in northern China, the heating system is necessary to keep indoor temperature above 20℃. Thus, the system can achieve the heating needs of the users and keep the indoor temperature steady.

        <p>Table . 3. Experimental parameters (Zhou et al., 2019). 11(a), the operating conditions are refer from Zhou et al. (Zhou et al., 2019). Under the same system components (PV/T collector/evaporator, compressor, condenser, expansion valve, water tank), the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. Heating COP of the PV/T system increases in the first 15 minutes because the water in the tank still in the low temperature range. Thus, the temperature differences between the refrigerant fluid and water remains large in the condenser leading to a high heat transfer efficiency. However, the heat transfer efficiency of the condenser would be decreased when the temperature of the inlet water rises up during the operation of the whole system. That is the reason of the reduction of heating COP after 15 minutes. The average error of heating COP is 2.84% while the maximum error is 5.12%. Fig. 11(b) presents the experimental and simulation results of the photovoltaic efficiency. The maximum photovoltaic efficiency is 10.11% while the minimum is 8.09%, but all the experimental photovoltaic efficiencies fluctuate around 9.24%. The simulation photovoltaic efficiencies remain around 9.25% but fluctuate from 9.01% to 9.7% due to the influence of solar radiation intensity. The average error of photovoltaic efficiency is 4.48% while the maximum error is 9.30%.Table . 3.
