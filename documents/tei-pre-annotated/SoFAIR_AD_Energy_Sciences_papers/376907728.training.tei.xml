        <p>Applying a novel Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) regression and the causality-in-quantiles approach, our empirical results demonstrate asymmetric and negative impacts of energy prices on carbon prices. The impacts are stronger at lower carbon quantiles and relatively smaller at higher quantiles (in absolute terms). Concerning different energy sources, the impacts of both oil and coal prices show a quasi-monotonic increase along with a rise in carbon quantiles; the absolute values of their impacts are much greater than that of the gas price impacts, depicting a relatively flat pattern. The results are consistent with our theoretical explanations which identify the two effect-transmission channels from energy to carbon prices, viz. the aggregated carbon demand effect and the fuel-switching effect. Thanks to the differences in energy sources and variability over their price distributions, the observed differential in carbon price-response is an indication of non-unique carbon market dynamics, the efficient management of which would require differentiated policy interventions. Robustness checks further confirm the accuracy of our conclusions.Applying a novel Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) regression and the causality-in-quantiles approach, our empirical results demonstrate asymmetric and negative impacts of energy prices on carbon prices.

        <p>To circumvent mounting problems in global climate change, the European Union (EU) launched the first 2 CO emission trading system in 2005: the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Founded on the principle of 'cap-and-trade', the EU ETS has proved to be an effective mitigation tool for European carbon emissions (Yu et al., 2015a). It has rapidly grown into the largest carbon markets worldwide covering over 50% of total 2 CO emissions produced by more than 11,000 heavy energy-using installations in 31 European countries. 1 The 'cap-and-trade' mechanism limits the use of carbon by the margin of a 'cap'. In other words, companies seeking to use more carbon basically engage in a 'trade' with the ones which have a surplus. Beyond the cap, an intended additional unit of carbon consumption would cost a hefty amount as competition effects led by demand pressure from various carbon-consumed sectors could give rise to the differential response of 'sell price' of an extra unit of carbon. 2 Thanks to the movement of energy prices, carbon prices can demonstrate heterogeneous response characterized by an asymmetric pattern at varied locations of carbon-energy price distributions (see, e.g. Chevallier, 2011;Hammoudeh et al., 2014b). Despite an inherent policy significance, a sparse body of literature has so far been dedicated to an in-depth study of this asymmetric effect.To circumvent mounting problems in global climate change, the European Union (EU) launched the first 2 CO emission trading system in 2005: the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS).

        <p>Why energy prices would drive carbon prices over time? A quick survey reveals a variety of reasons. First, there is a strong linkage between markets of (fossil) energy and carbon and economic activities. 3 The consumption of fossil energy serves as the main source of aggregate carbon emissions, intensely driving multitudinous aspects of economic development and human lives involving energy production, modern transportation, industrial operation process, and land-use changes, etc. (Balcılar et al., 2016). Hence, energy prices are natural predictors of carbon prices, at least in light of the fact that the largest source of total carbon emissions can be traced to fossil energy combustion (Christiansen et al., 2005). Second, when prices of carbon-consumption-led energy resources (i.e., fossil energy) are low (high), the demand of energy consumption will accordingly expand (shrink) given that the supply is constant and exogenous. This would result in a rise (decline) in carbon emissions followed by a rise in carbon allowance prices (Zhang and Sun, 2016). 4 Third, frequent proliferation of policy uncertainty and turbulence in the macroeconomic-financial systems might result in a rather close interaction between prices in energy and carbon markets in addition to their commodity features (Fan et al., 2013;Zhang and Huang, 2015).Why energy prices would drive carbon prices over time?

        <p>What implications can one draw from the effect of changes in energy prices on carbon prices? Given that carbon prices form an essential cost component of carbon-consumed installations from regulated industrial sectors, a primary implication concerns mitigation of carbon emissions and carbon price fluctuations. Therefore, uncovering the impacts of energy prices on carbon prices can provide useful information to the regulated installations to responsibly adjust their energy consumption structure to ensure cost efficiency and to meet their carbon emission targets in the long-run (Zhang and Sun, 2016). Moreover, understanding energy price impacts is pivotal to ensuring effectiveness of EU ETS, and this can be reflected through EU ETS's strong predictive ability of carbon price movements, as these are driven by underlying market fundamentals including energy prices (Lutz et al., 2013). 5 At the same time, due to rapid development of worldwide financial markets, the correlation among various asset and commodity markets is becoming increasingly large and complex. Thus, analyzing the relationship between carbon and energy markets equips practitioners with useful information regarding asset allocations and portfolio optimization (Subramaniam et al., 2015;Zhang and Sun, 2016). Finally, a precise 4 Energy price decrease (increase) could be due to either an expansion (a contraction) in the energy supply or a contraction (an expansion) in the energy demand. This may further result in a prosperous (tight) carbon market and heightened (lowered) carbon prices.What implications can one draw from the effect of changes in energy prices on carbon prices?

        <p>While a robust body of research has investigated the effects of energy prices on carbon price changes in Phases I and II of EU ETS, 6 the current paper is probably among the few attempts that examine the energy price impacts in Phase III. This latter phase is vastly different from the previous two phases, for instance, with regard to allocation mechanism, cap-setting, banking limitations, market role, market liquidity and expertise, respectively. 7 Specifically, Phase III uses auctioning as the main allocation mechanism of carbon emission allowances instead of the grandfathering, i.e., free carbon allowance allocation based on historical emissions, mainly employed in both Phases I and II. 8 Second, Regarding the cap-setting, instead of an indirect way of approving the National Allocation Plans (NAPs) employed in Phases I and II, in Phase III the European Commission (EC) directly sets the EU-wide carbon emission cap, indicating a stricter and more effective cap-setting (Lutz et al., 2013). Moreover, greater amounts of carbon-consumed sectors, including production and processing of non-ferrous metals, are regulated since the start of Phase III. Third, in terms of the banking limitation, neither banking nor borrowing of carbon allowance credits were allowed between Phases I and II, leading to a self-contained market in Phase I that is unrelated to future caps (Daskalakis et al., 2009). In contrast, the limitation was then released so that the subsequent Phases II and III can be well connected via banking. Allowing banking of spare allowances across different phases contributes to reducing the risk of dramatic price declines.While a robust body of research has investigated the effects of energy prices on carbon price changes in Phases I and II of EU ETS, 6 the current paper is probably among the few attempts that examine the energy price impacts in Phase III.

        <p>Fourth, in terms of the role of market in emission reductions, the ultimate goal of the EU ETS is to enforce reductions of carbon emissions in the carbon-intensive sectors. As Phase I is widely recognized as a pilot period for newly established regulatory institutes and market participants, it does not possess any clear goal for carbon emission reductions contrary to the later 6 See, e.g., Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007); Alberola et al. (2008); Creti et al. (2012); Zhang and Sun (2016). 7 New updates in Phase III are documented in Directive 2009/29/EC (European Parliament and Council, 2009). 8 As the free allocation setting is replaced by 'auctioning' in Phase III, the carbon allowance demand and price formation reflect more about market participants' expectation of energy price movements and energy structure adjustments of the installations, and vice versa, leading to a closer bi-directional carbon-energy price relationship in Phase III against that in previous phases (Koch, 2014).Fourth, in terms of the role of market in emission reductions, the ultimate goal of the EU ETS is to enforce reductions of carbon emissions in the carbon-intensive sectors.

        <p>phases. 9 Fifth, in terms of the market liquidity and expertise, considering that Phase I is recognized as a learning period of the EU ETS, market at this initial stage is characterized by low liquidity and highly volatile price movements. 10 Since the start of Phase II when the market becomes increasingly matured, trading volumes have also increased significantly, resulting in a more stable price movement with smaller volatility (Mizrach and Otsubo, 2014). In addition, the types of market transactions have also evolved from spot market dominated transactions (such as bilateral and over-the-counter transactions) in the initial phase to various types of transactions, notably including derivative transactions (such as transactions of futures contracts, options, and swaps) (Lutz et al., 2013).phases. 9 Fifth, in terms of the market liquidity and expertise, considering that Phase I is recognized as a learning period of the EU ETS, market at this initial stage is characterized by low liquidity and highly volatile price movements. 10 Since the start of Phase II when the market becomes increasingly matured, trading volumes have also increased significantly, resulting in a more stable price movement with smaller volatility (Mizrach and Otsubo, 2014).

        <p>Having experienced significant institutional development and advances in the market design over phases, Phase III is characterized by a more mature market environment with more enhanced informational efficiency and higher market liquidity compared to previous phases (Chung and Hrazdil, 2010;Mizrach and Otsubo, 2014;Yu et al., 2015b). Therefore, the carbon-energy price linkage becomes even stronger (Koch, 2014), while the changing nature of the carbon price formation driven by energy prices could be better captured in a highly mature market phase alike in Phase III against that in early phases (Lutz et al., 2013;Montagnoli and De Vries, 2010). Moreover, increases in maturity from Phases I to III also support the argument of inconstant carbon-energy price relationship over phases as recently documented (see, e.g., Aatola et al., 2013;Chevallier, 2012;Creti et al., 2012;Ibrahim and Kalaitzoglou, 2016;Tan and Wang, 2017).

        <p>While it is crucial to extend existing results of energy price impacts on carbon prices to the latest Phase III, the effort is surprising nascent. Although it is widely acknowledged that energy price impacts could be heterogeneous with an asymmetric pattern over carbon-energy price distributions, serious studies have yet to emerge. The current paper fills the literature gap by 9 The later phases clearly assign their individual reduction targets as already introduced at the beginning of this section.While it is crucial to extend existing results of energy price impacts on carbon prices to the latest Phase III, the effort is surprising nascent.

        <p>10 These are the features in Phase I except after 2006 when both market liquidity and price variation was very low due to the price breakdown. This was caused by the disclosure of the information in April 2006 indicating that the overall emission cap was not restrictive in Phase I. Moreover, no banking of allowance credits was allowed between Phase I and II, further leading to the price breakdown.10 These are the features in Phase I except after 2006 when both market liquidity and price variation was very low due to the price breakdown.

We employ a nonparametric quantile causality method proposed by Jeong et al.

        <p>Unlike many previous studies, we focus on futures rather than spot contracts, as the volumes being traded on futures contracts are much greater than that on spot contracts (Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007).12 Second, price dynamics of futures contracts are not exposed to significant structural breaks and abnormal price jumps as being characterized by the spot price series (Bredin and Muckley, 2011). Third, the spot trading market of EUA is relatively immature compared to the futures market (Daskalakis et al., 2009;Aatola et al., 2013), indicating a better capture of the decision making of carbon-consumed installations via the futures price movements (Rickels et al., 2007). Concurrently, futures prices are represented in a return format to measure how growth in energy futures prices affects the growth in carbon futures prices. 13Our work contributes to the existing literature on the subject in the following aspects. First, 11 It is known that the relationship between contemporaneous terms of carbon and energy prices could be bidirectional, while a failure to account for this would give rise to biased estimation results. To deal with such the endogeneity problem of the simultaneity, following existing related literature (see, e.g. Aldy and Pizer, 2015;Coglianese et al., 2017;Duan et al., 2019), our QQ model specification is determined based on the argument that past energy prices are predetermined with regard to current carbon prices. Accordingly, our employed QQ model uses the time-lagged term of energy prices as the explanatory variable and the contemporaneous term of carbon prices as the dependent variable, through which the potential endogeneity problem can be well mitigated. Moreover, the setting of our employed QQ model is also consistent with Lin and Nelson (2019), suggesting that a dynamic lead-lag quantile analysis can handle the endogeneity in data.Unlike many previous studies, we focus on futures rather than spot contracts, as the volumes being traded on futures contracts are much greater than that on spot contracts (Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007).12 Second, price dynamics of futures contracts are not exposed to significant structural breaks and abnormal price jumps as being characterized by the spot price series (Bredin and Muckley, 2011).

        <p>we extend the sparse research regarding energy price impacts on carbon prices in Phase III, a phase which is largely different from the previous two phases. Second, we quantify the marginal impacts of energy prices at different locations of both carbon and energy price distributions. For this purpose, we apply the QQ method as it can adequately identify the heterogeneity and full-distributional characterization of carbon and energy price dynamics, providing statistically robust results (Lin and Nelson, 2019). 14 In fact, compared to the traditional quantile regression, the QQ method provides a complete picture on carbon price determinations by energy prices under different quantiles or economic conditions. Moreover, the asymmetric and non-linear impacts of energy prices captured by the QQ method tend to be more policy-informative against the mean-based estimations obtained by the OLS method because a differentiated, rather than a uniform policy, would produce allocative efficiency.we extend the sparse research regarding energy price impacts on carbon prices in Phase III, a phase which is largely different from the previous two phases.

        <p>Third, we examine how carbon prices at different quantiles are causally affected by energy prices using a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles method. In contrast to the mean-based strategy that would incur serious information loss due to non-treatment of effects at various parts of the distribution, the causality-in-quantiles method characterizes Granger causality from energy to carbon prices in the entire distribution and produces robust results even in the presence of fat tails and outliers in the real data. Fourth, rather than solely relying on the well-known fuel-switching effect (i.e., the shift of fuel inputs between high-carbon coal and low-carbon gas in the power sector to achieve the abatement while maintaining the profitability), the paper identifies a new effect-transmission channel, the aggregated carbon demand effect, to describe how a change in energy prices can influence the carbon demand and then drive carbon prices given a fixed carbon supply. The two channels together offer the theoretical explanation in our paper, through which empirical results of the marginal energy price impacts on carbon prices can be well interpreted.Third, we examine how carbon prices at different quantiles are causally affected by energy prices using a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles method.

        <p>Consistent with our theoretical expectations, several important results emerge from our empirical analyses. First, while energy price impacts on carbon prices are found to be overall negative, the impacts are asymmetric at different quantiles of the carbon price distribution: higher at low carbon-price quantiles compared to that at high quantiles (in absolute values). Second, the impact patterns of prices of different energy sources (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal) are distinct thanks to the differences in their market characteristics and carbon emission volumes. The causal relationship between energy and carbon prices is found to be significant except for a small range of extreme carbon quantiles, demonstrating the predictive power of energy prices on carbon prices.Consistent with our theoretical expectations, several important results emerge from our empirical analyses.

        <p>In Table 3 we have summarized key literature related to energy price impacts on carbon prices in different phases of EU ETS. Specifically, we find a robust body of research for Phase I of EU ETS (Convery et al., 2008). Phase I is considered as a 'pilot period ' during 2005-2007 where the regulatory and monitoring authority were put online. To investigate the dynamics of carbon prices in the first phase, with an argument regarding the carbon abatement cost, extant literature devotes attention to the determination of carbon prices driven by energy prices (see, e.g., Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007;Alberola et al., 2008;Hintermann, 2010;Alberola et al., 2009), or alternatively, the prediction of future movements of carbon prices (see, e.g., Benz and Trück, 2009;Daskalakis et al., 2009;Paolella and Taschini, 2008;Seifert et al., 2008). Specifically, Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) highlight the important role of energy prices, i.e., oil, natural gas, coal and electricity, in determining carbon prices. As discussed in Christiansen et al. (2005), Alberola et al. (2008Alberola et al. ( , 2009) ) and Hintermann (2010) Moreover, the compliance break that occurred in Phase I can be largely attributed to its underlying flaws in the institutional setting. These flaws result in a high exposure and risk of dramatic drop of carbon spot prices, which has experienced a significant price plunge in April 2006, falling from 29.5 euros to less than 12 euros only in a rather short period, when the National Allocation Plans for Phase I were proved to be too generous. In particular, one of its weaknesses regarding the restriction of 'banking' credits (e.g., carbon allowances) to subsequent phases makes EU ETS a self-contained market, leading to a lack of connection with following phases (Koch, 2014). Thus, through the aspects of information processing and market efficiency, EU ETS is immature in Phase I in contrast to the subsequent phases (Montagnoli and De Vries, 2010).In Table 3 we have summarized key literature related to energy price impacts on carbon prices in different phases of EU ETS. Specifically, we find a robust body of research for Phase I of EU ETS (Convery et al., 2008). Phase I is considered as a 'pilot period ' during 2005-2007 where the regulatory and monitoring authority were put online. To investigate the dynamics of carbon prices in the first phase, with an argument regarding the carbon abatement cost, extant literature devotes attention to the determination of carbon prices driven by energy prices (see, e.g., Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007;Alberola et al., 2008;Hintermann, 2010;Alberola et al., 2009), or alternatively, the prediction of future movements of carbon prices (see, e.g., Benz and Trück, 2009;Daskalakis et al., 2009;Paolella and Taschini, 2008;Seifert et al., 2008). Specifically, Mansanet-Bataller et al. (2007) highlight the important role of energy prices, i.e., oil, natural gas, coal and electricity, in determining carbon prices.

        <p>Accordingly, EU ETS in Phase II has made substantial improvements to ameliorate weaknesses in Phase I (Egenhofer et al., 2011), and is set to represent as a fundamental regulatory instrument to allow member states to comply with their commitment in the Kyoto Protocol (Creti et al., 2012). Having recognized significant difference between two phases of EU ETS, relevant literature has further contributed to the investigation of carbon price dynamics and its driven forces from energy markets in 2008-2012 (Phase II) (see, e.g., Aatola et al., 2013;Bredin and Muckley, 2011;Creti et al., 2012;Keppler and Mansanet-Bataller, 2010;Lutz et al., 2013;Schandl et al., 2016). 15 Specifically, by employing a cointegration method, Creti et al. (2012) discusses carbon price determination pattern in the first and second phases of EU ETS, and find that the long-run relationship between the carbon price and its drivers is distinct in these two phases. They further evaluate that impacts of carbon price drivers including energy prices and equity price index on equilibrium carbon price determinations, are all significant and greater in Phase II compared with that in Phase I. Zhang and Sun (2016) analyze both return and volatility spillovers between carbon and energy markets using the DCC threshold GARCH (DCC-TGARCH) model and the full BEKK-GARCH model. They find significant and unidirectional volatility spillovers from the coal market to the carbon market, and from the carbon market to the natural gas market, whereas no spillover between carbon and oil markets were discerned. Using a DCC-TGARCH model, they further find that coal price returns exert negative and significant impacts on carbon price returns, while the impacts of both natural gas and oil price returns are also negative but insignificant.Accordingly, EU ETS in Phase II has made substantial improvements to ameliorate weaknesses in Phase I (Egenhofer et al., 2011), and is set to represent as a fundamental regulatory instrument to allow member states to comply with their commitment in the Kyoto Protocol (Creti et al., 2012).

        <p>Recent years have experienced frequent structural changes in economic and institutional functionalities across the globe. As a result, both sign and magnitude of impacts of market fundamentals involving energy prices on carbon price movements have also been subject to volatilities as well (Lutz et al., 2013;Ji et al., 2018;Tan and Wang, 2017). In view of the differences between Phase III and previous two phases, existing conclusions on the factors driving carbon price determination in Phases I and II may no longer be valid in Phase III. In the case of the US, Hammoudeh et al. (2014b) measure negative impacts of oil, natural gas, and coal on carbon prices and find that the intensity of negative impacts of oil prices increases with a rise in carbon price levels. The negative impacts of natural gas prices are found to be much stronger when carbon prices are at the higher quantiles. Hammoudeh et al. (2015) focus on 2 CO price determinations in the US and find negative impacts of fossil energy (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal) on carbon emission allowance prices. The impacts of oil and coal are asymmetric while natural gas price impacts tend to be relatively symmetric. Tan and Wang (2017) employ a quantile regression approach and show that impacts of coal and oil prices are overall negative, while gas price impacts are negative at lower carbon quantiles and turn to become positive at higher quantiles.Recent years have experienced frequent structural changes in economic and institutional functionalities across the globe.

        <p>Due to the reliance on the conventional mean-based estimations such as OLS, most studies fail to capture the heterogeneity in the marginal energy price impacts at different quantiles of carbon and energy prices. Eventually, extant studies report mixed results. For example, the impact of oil prices is found to be either positive (see, e.g., Chevallier, 2009;Creti et al., 2012;Reboredo and Ugolini, 2018), or negative/insignificant (see, e.g., Bredin and Muckley, 2011;Reboredo, 2014;Hammoudeh et al., 2014bHammoudeh et al., , 2015;;Yu et al., 2015b). Regarding the impact of natural gas, Hammoudeh et al. (2014b) show that it is negative when carbon prices are low, but positive when carbon prices are high. Lutz et al. (2013) point out a positive impact of natural gas prices regardless of whether carbon price volatility is high or low. Regarding the impact of coal, Lutz et al. (2013) find it tends to be positive in a high volatility regime, and negative in a low volatility regime of carbon prices. Hammoudeh et al. (2014b) find negative impacts of coal prices on carbon prices, while Creti et al. (2012) demonstrate that coal price impacts are negative in Phase I and positive in Phase II in equilibrium conditions. Moreover, traditional quantile regression has also been applied, despitely sparsely, in recent studies. For instance, Hammoudeh et al. (2014b) find distinct impacts of energy prices involving oil, natural gas, and electricity on different quantiles of carbon prices in the US. Reboredo and Ugolini (2018) measure the impacts of price dynamics in energy markets on different quantiles of clean energy stock returns, and find that both oil and electricity prices contribute to the majority of stock return fluctuations. Nevertheless, this method fails to account for the potentially distinct impacts of quantiles of a given explanatory variable on the distribution of the dependent variable. Thus, to mitigate the weaknesses encountered by the conventional methods, Sim and Zhou (2015) propose an innovative quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach to gauge the heterogeneous impacts of different quantiles of explanatory variables on quantiles of the dependent variable.

        <p>As briefly mentioned in Section 1, we use the recently developed quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach (Sim and Zhou, 2015) to investigate the impact of crude oil, natural gas, and coal futures markets on the carbon futures market. The QQ method combines traditional quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett Jr, 1978) and nonparametric estimation, which can be used to empirically investigate how the quantiles of the explanatory variables affect the conditional quantiles of the dependent variable. Technically, the strengths of the QQ method are detailed summarized as follows. First, compared with the mean-based method such as OLS and the traditional quantile regression method, the QQ approach can fully capture the potential asymmetric response of dependent variable across distributions of both explanatory and dependent variables. At the same time, the QQ method can be robust to outliers and non-normality in the real data. Thus, it could provide a more comprehensive and precise understanding of the relationship between the variables under different market conditions. Second, as a nonparametric local linear regression method, the QQ approach can consistently estimate the smooth changing parameters and uncover underlying structural breaks in the real data (Stone, 1977;Sim and Zhou, 2015). 16 Thus, compared with the traditional quantile regression, the QQ method captures the local effects of each quantile of a given independent variable on the dependent variable. In addition, rather than assuming that the timing of the structural break is known, the QQ method endogenizes inherent structural changes in the real data.As briefly mentioned in Section 1, we use the recently developed quantile-on-quantile (QQ) approach (Sim and Zhou, 2015) to investigate the impact of crude oil, natural gas, and coal futures markets on the carbon futures market.

        <p>Third, by employing QQ method, we are able to relax the conventionally assumed linear model setting in traditional quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett Jr, 1978), and accommodate potentially existing non-linearity between explanatory and dependent variables. Indeed, it has been documented that the determinations of carbon prices tend to be non-linear (Paolella and Taschini, 2008;Benz and Trück, 2009). Fourth, since we consider the impacts of temporal-lag in the independent variable on the contemporaneous dependent variable, the QQ method ameliorates the endogeneity problem regarding the simultaneity, thanks to the nature of its model specification. Finally, using a cross-validation method, we further improve the original version of the QQ approach proposed by Sim and Zhou (2015) to find a suitable bandwidth, which provides the much required balance between the bias and the variance during the estimation. Thus, the QQ method enables us to uncover the real marginal impacts of energy prices on carbon prices over the carbon-energy price distributions, and can provide more informative results in contrast to both OLS and traditional quantile regression.Third, by employing QQ method, we are able to relax the conventionally assumed linear model setting in traditional quantile regression (Koenker and Bassett Jr, 1978), and accommodate potentially existing non-linearity between explanatory and dependent variables.

Moreover, the estimated bandwidth based on the rule-of-thumb method tends to be over-smoothed and may fail to approximate reality (Hall et al., 1991), further indicating its inappropriateness in our empirical analysis. Concerning the fix-bandwidth setting, particularly in the QQ estimation, existing literature (see, e.g. Sim and Zhou, 2015) arbitrarily chooses a constant bandwidth, = 0.05 h , which may not be suitable for different empirical data and would lead to biased and unreliable results.However, as the accuracy of the rule-of-thumb bandwidth relies heavily on the density distribution, this bandwidth selection could be inaccurate when the density function is not normally distributed (Hall et al., 1991;Heidenreich et al., 2013).

        <p>From the descriptive statistics, we have confirmed that our series are stationary and non-normal possessing heavy tails. Therefore, quantile regression framework is best suited for our purpose as it can model asymmetric effects of the independent variable on different quantiles of the dependent variable. It is necessary to model 'causality' between energy and carbon prices by moving away from the methods that assume 'unimodal' distribution. Motivated by this, in this section, we present two sets of results: estimates from the QQ regression depicting variable patterns of 'dynamic association' across the entire price distribution in carbon and energy markets. Second, we also present directions of causality, within the architecture quantile estimation. Our idea, thus is to recover 'heterogeneous correlation with an asymmetric pattern' and variable direction of causality over the price distributions. As we will see shortly, our results are consistent with established theoretical arguments.From the descriptive statistics, we have confirmed that our series are stationary and non-normal possessing heavy tails.

It is necessary to model 'causality' between energy and carbon prices by moving away from the methods that assume 'unimodal' distribution. Motivated by this, in this section, we present two sets of results: estimates from the QQ regression depicting variable patterns of 'dynamic association' across the entire price distribution in carbon and energy markets. Second, we also present directions of causality, within the architecture quantile estimation. Our idea, thus is to recover 'heterogeneous correlation with an asymmetric pattern' and variable direction of causality over the price distributions. As we will see shortly, our results are consistent with established theoretical arguments.</p>

The implication is that the impact magnitudes are the greatest at higher carbon price quantiles, becoming weaker around the median quantiles, declining further at the lower quantile levels. Thus, an increase in oil prices has an asymmetric and negative impact on carbon prices over the carbon price distribution. Second, concerning the impact of natural gas prices, while the effects are negative across quantiles of carbon prices, there is visible stability of trend and changes with a waveform.

In absolute terms, the impact is much weaker at higher quantiles of carbon prices compared to that at the lower quantiles. Overall, in Phase III of EU ETS, we note that the impacts of energy prices on carbon prices are overall negative and asymmetric at different carbon price quantiles. In absolute terms, price impacts of different energy sources (i.e., oil, gas, and coal) tend to inflate at low carbon quantiles in contrast to that at high quantiles. At the same time, prices of different energy sources on carbon price formation show distinct impact patterns, governed by forces from the two effect-transmission channels, i.e. the fuel-switching effect and the aggregated carbon demand effect. 19 Specifically, oil price impacts on carbon prices tend to be larger when carbon price quantiles become lower (in absolute terms). Gas prices present a relatively flat impact pattern over the carbon price distribution, while the impacts are smaller than that of oil and coal (in absolute terms). Similar to both oil and coal prices, impacts of different gas price quantiles on carbon prices appear to be broadly symmetric, while magnitudes of the impacts are still different although slightly over the gas price distribution. In terms of the coal price, its impact pattern is highly similar to that of the oil price and depicts a quasi-monotonic growth with increases in carbon price quantiles, although magnitudes of both their impacts are different over the carbon price distribution.depicting a monotonic increase in weight as we move from low to high carbon quantiles.

        <p>To further compare our QQ-estimated results with that from the conventional approach, we estimate the price impacts of each energy source on carbon prices by using both the OLS method and the traditional quantile regression. The results are summarised in Table 2. In line with the QQ estimation and our expectations, the results from both the OLS method and the traditional quantile regression confirm the overall negative impact of energy prices on carbon prices. As shown in Table 2, oil prices exert a more negative and significant impact at lower carbon price quantiles compared with that at higher quantiles. The negative impact of natural gas prices on carbon prices behaves a relatively flat pattern although its impact at both lower and higher carbon price quantiles is greater than that at the middle quantile. In terms of the coal price, it also demonstrates a negative impact although the impact is less significant at lower carbon price quantiles. While the asymmetric energy price impacts at different carbon price quantiles are explored by employing the traditional quantile regression, the latter fails to fully capture the potential asymmetry, particularly over the energy price distribution.

        <p>In this subsection, we discuss our results vis-a-vis results from the previous studies. The first question is what inferences can be drawn when comparing existing results from early phases and ours from Phase III? In Table 3 we have summarized findings from the extant research. Then our strategy will be to draw upon these results to lend a detailed comparison with ours, be it with regard to the market period under consideration, the estimation method and the theoretical explanation, in a threefold manner. The corresponding significance and enlightenment are summarized in the comparative discussion. First, we observe that price impacts of each energy source (i.e., oil, gas, and coal) on carbon prices vary over time and are sensitive to the choice of sample periods, i.e., the specific phase of the EU ETS under consideration. For instance, the impacts of oil prices on carbon prices can be insignificant in Phase I and positive in Phase II (Alberola et al., 2008;Bredin and Muckley, 2011), while it can be negative after the initial periods based on a sample covering both Phases II and III (Hammoudeh et al., 2014a). For gas prices, its impacts could be insignificant in Phase I and negative in Phase II (Bredin and Muckley, 2011). They further find that the impacts of coal prices tend to be insignificant in Phase I, positive in Phase II and negative when considering both Phase I and II. Contextualized with our empirical results in Phase III, we find the overall negative impacts of prices of different energy sources on carbon price determination.

This confirms the argument of the existing research (see, e.g. Aatola et al., 2013;Creti et al., 2012;Tan and Wang, 2017) and our theoretical expectations. Thus, the evolutionary energy price impacts on carbon prices over phases, along with a better capture of the nature of carbon price formation in a more mature market (Lutz et al., 2013;Montagnoli and De Vries, 2010), motivate us greatly to extend the existing findings to the latest Phase III.in Phase III with the ones in previous phases, we demonstrate the evolutionary pattern of impacts of energy prices following the maturity of the market from Phases I to III.

        <p>Markov-switching VAR model, Chevallier (2011) demonstrates that energy prices exert varied impacts on carbon prices when energy prices are respectively at high and low price levels implied by a strong and weak economy. When comparing our results with the existing studies, it is evident that the marginal effects of energy prices on carbon prices could be asymmetric over carbon-energy price distributions. This is consistent with the literature (see, e.g., Hammoudeh et al., 2014b;Tan and Wang, 2017). However, concerning the currently-employed method, its encountered weaknesses, such as the endogeneity issue and a failure to fully capture the asymmetry and nonlinearity across carbon-energy price quantiles, would result in a potential estimation bias. In contrast, our employed Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) method can improve the aforementioned weaknesses and contribute to a robust estimation procedure, through which the true marginal impacts of energy prices on carbon prices over carbon-energy price distributions are uncovered.Markov-switching VAR model, Chevallier (2011) demonstrates that energy prices exert varied impacts on carbon prices when energy prices are respectively at high and low price levels implied by a strong and weak economy.

        <p>Third, the theoretical explanation related to impacts of energy prices on carbon prices could be further elevated. Indeed, the fuel switching mechanism has been widely embraced in the existing literature to explain the relationship between carbon and energy prices (see, e.g., Alberola et al., 2008;Creti et al., 2012;Lutz et al., 2013). However, an increasing number of studies have recently pointed out that solely relying on this argument is inappropriate and insufficient due to the reasons, including a failure to directly explain the role of oil prices and a dampened effectiveness of the mechanism typically in Phase III (see, e.g., Hammoudeh et al., 2014b;Chevallier et al., 2019). Hence, the importance of our research also lies in establishing a solid and comprehensive theoretical explanation regarding the energy price impacts. In addition to the fuel-switching mechanism, our paper elaborates a naturally-existing but typically-ignored effect-transmission channel, i.e., the aggregated carbon demand effect, that clearly identifies how price changes in different energy sources impact carbon prices by altering the carbon demand given that the carbon supply is fixed. Thus, our empirical results can be well interpreted through our theoretical explanations that identify the two channels.Third, the theoretical explanation related to impacts of energy prices on carbon prices could be further elevated.

        <p>Although some studies have covered Phase III, their primary focus is on the analysis of previous phases, and only include very limited data for Phase III to invoke a reference. For example, the results of Hammoudeh et al. (2014a,b); Zhang and Sun (2016) (see Table 3) are with regard to a part of Phase I and the whole of Phase II, while considering only very initial periods of Phase III. Therefore, insights into energy price impacts on carbon prices drawn on extensive data in Phase III are still nascent despite the crucial differences between phases. From Table 3, although we find that results of the existing limited research in Phase III are broadly consistent with ours and demonstrate overall negative impacts of energy prices (see, e.g. Zhang and Sun, 2016;Zhu et al., 2019), the efforts that exploit the median-based estimation instead of the mean-based one are still sparse.

        <p>Do our results conform to an established theory? To shed light, we first revisit the currently popular theoretical argument, the fuel-switching effect/mechanism, and understand its potential weaknesses. The inappropriateness of solely relying on the fuel-switching mechanism to interpret energy price impacts on carbon prices in Phase III is discussed, considering the unique features of Phase III. Then, we introduce another effect-transmission channel, viz. the aggregated carbon demand effect (involving the energy demand effect and production restraint effect), and provide theoretical explanations regarding energy price impacts by identifying these two channels. We latter show that the framework provides a sensible theoretical interpretation of effect-transmissions from prices of different energy sources (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal) to carbon prices at different locations of carbon-energy price distribution in Phase III. Given that the supply of carbon allowance allocation in EU ETS is fixed and available in advance to all market participants (Ellerman and Buchner, 2008), aggregate levels of carbon emissions and carbon price dynamics are determined by a shift of the carbon demand following shocks notably from energy price fluctuations (Chevallier et al., 2019;Lutz et al., 2013;Tan and Wang, 2017).Do our results conform to an established theory?

        <p>Conventional studies normally attribute the impacts of energy prices on carbon prices to the existence of fuel switching mechanism: the switch of energy consumption tendency between highand low-carbon energy resources used in power production (see detail descriptions in, e.g. Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007;Alberola et al., 2008;Hammoudeh et al., 2014a). For instance, a rise in gas prices can push carbon-intensive plants to turn to coal, leading to an increase in both carbon emissions/demand and prices. While this explanation about the energy price impact on the carbon price has been widely embraced in extant literature, it nevertheless suffers from a number of weaknesses. First, although it links carbon allowance prices with energy prices, the switching mechanism only considers shifting fuel inputs of power generators between natural gas and coal in the power and heat sector. However, it cannot directly explain oil price impacts on carbon prices as oil is normally not used in the power generation (Hammoudeh et al., 2014b). 20 Moreover, the argument fails to account for the impacts of other regulated carbon-intensive sectors, such as fuel combustion by energy users, transportation, and oil refineries, etc. (Eurostat, 2019), on the carbon price formation driven by energy prices. 21Second, recent research, such as Chevallier et al. (2019), admit the possible 'failure of fuel switching mechanism' in the power generation. The implication is that the switching from high-carbon coal to low-carbon natural gas has not yet occurred when carbon abatement costs have been considered in the measurement of the relative price levels of energy fuel inputs. This failure can be attributed to the current higher costs of the switching mechanism compared with that of the carbon abatement. Moreover, a failure of the fuel switching mechanism can also be attributed to the high production costs driven by high levels of energy prices (Tan and Wang, 2017). For example, given an increase in gas price, the fuel switching from gas to coal could be weakened when the coal price is exceptionally high, leading to an inflation in power production costs and then a drop in both the carbon demand and prices.Conventional studies normally attribute the impacts of energy prices on carbon prices to the existence of fuel switching mechanism: the switch of energy consumption tendency between highand low-carbon energy resources used in power production (see detail descriptions in, e.g. Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007;Alberola et al., 2008;Hammoudeh et al., 2014a).

        <p>In addition to the fuel-switching mechanism, we introduce another effect-transmission channel, i.e., the aggregated carbon demand effect (involving the energy demand effect and production restraint effect) to explain our empirical results. While exploiting aggregate carbon demand effect, the influencing path from energy prices to carbon prices can be explained jointly by the dynamics of energy demand and industrial production restraint of carbon-intensive installations in the aggregate level (Tan and Wang, 2017). Specifically, a positive/negative price change in carbon-intensive resources (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal), due to either a strong/weak demand or weak/strong supply, can inflate/deflate marginal production costs of installations using such energy as an input. It results in a smaller/larger expectation of future production outputs, before depressing/amplifying their future energy demand. Eventually, it might lead to a bearish/bullish market expectation of future carbon emissions and prices. We therefore, conclude that current energy price fluctuations are expected to exert negative impacts on future carbon prices, while the impact intensity on this market expectation could be asymmetric at different locations of carbon-energy price distribution (Hammoudeh et al., 2014b;Tan and Wang, 2017).In addition to the fuel-switching mechanism, we introduce another effect-transmission channel, i.e., the aggregated carbon demand effect (involving the energy demand effect and production restraint effect) to explain our empirical results.

        <p>In a situation when current carbon prices are at high quantiles (such as in a booming economy), in response to an initial positive shock in energy prices, the installations could also face strong concurrent demand for their outputs. As a result, they would still keep their production levels and the energy demand at a relatively high level, hence a sustained high 2 CO emissions.In a situation when current carbon prices are at high quantiles (such as in a booming economy), in response to an initial positive shock in energy prices, the installations could also face strong concurrent demand for their outputs.

        <p>This may dampen the expectation of a decrease in future carbon emissions and prices, indicating that during a boom with high carbon prices, a positive shock in current energy prices can exert (small and negligible) negative impacts on the movement of future carbon price levels. Contrarily, when current carbon prices are at low quantiles (i.e., the economy is in the bust period), production costs of the installations will accelerate given an increase in energy prices, while the market demand of their production outputs would be considerably tightened. This leads to a significant drop in the future expectation of the energy demand and carbon emissions as well as carbon prices.This may dampen the expectation of a decrease in future carbon emissions and prices, indicating that during a boom with high carbon prices, a positive shock in current energy prices can exert (small and negligible) negative impacts on the movement of future carbon price levels.

        <p>Hence, the expectation tends to become more intense during bust with low carbon prices compared with that in the boom periods with high carbon prices. Our theoretical explanations concerning the channel of the aggregated carbon demand effect are also supported by the extant literature (see, e.g., Chevallier, 2011;Hammoudeh et al., 2014b;Tan and Wang, 2017).Hence, the expectation tends to become more intense during bust with low carbon prices compared with that in the boom periods with high carbon prices.

        <p>Given that the market characteristics and carbon emission intensity of different energy sources (i.e., oil, gas, and coal) are largely dissimilar, therefore, they demonstrate differential impact paths on carbon price variations (Hammoudeh et al., 2014a,b). We now discuss how the impacts of each energy prices can be transmitted to carbon prices in Phase III by combining both the channels of the aggregate carbon demand effect and the fuel-switching mechanism. Through this, our theoretical explanations can well improve the potential weaknesses of solely replying on the fuel-switching mechanism, while considering the unique characteristics of Phase III, such as a close carbon-energy price relationship. Thus, we provide a comprehensive framework to explain price impacts of each of the three energy resources on carbon prices over carbon-energy price distributions in Phase III.Given that the market characteristics and carbon emission intensity of different energy sources (i.e., oil, gas, and coal) are largely dissimilar, therefore, they demonstrate differential impact paths on carbon price variations (Hammoudeh et al., 2014a,b).

        <p>With regard to oil, as it is typically not used in electricity production, there exists negligible substitution of coal and gas for oil. Thus, its impacts are dominated by the channel of the aggregated carbon demand effect that an increase in current oil price could depress economic activities and raise production costs (Hamilton, 1983;Kilian, 2008;Lardic and Mignon, 2008), in turn leading to depression of future expectation of production outputs and energy (i.e., oil)With regard to oil, as it is typically not used in electricity production, there exists negligible substitution of coal and gas for oil.

        <p>demand. The process leads to a fall in future carbon emissions and prices. In the case of Phase III, this negative impact tends to be stronger when the carbon price is low or the economy is weak, while being less intense when carbon prices are at high quantiles or the economy is strong (in absolute terms). The explanations are consistent with our obtained results shown in Figure 2.demand. The process leads to a fall in future carbon emissions and prices.

        <p>With regard to gas, its impacts on carbon price determinations are governed by the aforementioned two channels, while the impacts from different channels appear opposite. Through the channel of aggregated carbon demand effect, similar to the oil price impacts, the impacts of gas prices are generally negative and tend to be stronger at low carbon price quantiles compared with that of at high carbon price quantiles (in absolute terms). At the same time, through the channel of fuel-switching mechanism, given that gas is a cleaner energy source that only contains around half of the 2 CO in coal (Hammoudeh et al., 2014a), a rise in gas prices can increase the demand for coal from the plants, subsequently leading to a heightened carbon demand and prices in the future.With regard to gas, its impacts on carbon price determinations are governed by the aforementioned two channels, while the impacts from different channels appear opposite.

        <p>Our findings of the overall negative impacts of gas prices shown in Figure 3 suggest that the negative impact from the aggregated carbon demand effect channel outweighs the positive impact from the fuel switching mechanism in Phase III. Moreover, given that the fuel-switching mechanism tends to be weak especially in Phase III as previously discussed in this section, it further indicates that the theoretically positive effects from this mechanism are negligible. In addition, the offset of opposite forces from the two channels leads to smaller negative impacts of gas prices with a relatively flat pattern compared to the impacts of both oil and coal prices.Our findings of the overall negative impacts of gas prices shown in Figure 3 suggest that the negative impact from the aggregated carbon demand effect channel outweighs the positive impact from the fuel switching mechanism in Phase III.

        <p>Finally, as for coal, despite the well-known environmental hazards, its consumption still accounts for one-third of the total inputs for power generation in the EU; therefore, its changes can greatly affect carbon price levels (Aatola et al., 2013). Exploiting the logic of the two channels, both of them predict negative impacts of coal prices on carbon prices (see Figure 5(b)). Coal prices tend to manifest greater impacts than oil prices, which impacts are only driven by one channel (i.e., the aggregated demand effects), especially at high carbon quantiles (in absolute terms). In addition, effects of coal prices demonstrate a quasi-monotonic increase with increases in carbon price levels. We conclude that in Phase III the price impacts of different energy sources (i.e., oil, gas, and coal) on carbon prices are overall negative. Different energy price impacts are distinct and governed by dual forces from the two effect-transmission channels, while their impacts exert a similar asymmetric pattern over the carbon price distribution: smaller at high carbon quantiles and larger at low carbon quantiles (in absolute values). Our theoretical explanations are in line with the obtained empirical results.Finally, as for coal, despite the well-known environmental hazards, its consumption still accounts for one-third of the total inputs for power generation in the EU; therefore, its changes can greatly affect carbon price levels (Aatola et al., 2013).

        <p>We now present the result from the causality-in-quantile test, which identifies the causal effects of energy prices on carbon prices. It considers the dynamics of the causality on different market conditions represented by different carbon quantile levels. In Figures 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c) we have presented the nonparametric and asymmetric price impacts of different energy sources (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal). Specifically, Figure 7(a) shows that the null hypothesis of no Granger causality-in-quantile from oil prices to carbon prices is rejected at the most quantile levels of carbon prices. The hump-shaped curve shows that the causality is non-linear and asymmetric, indicating a strong predictive power of oil prices around the median quantile (normal market conditions). In this case, the power decreases at upper and lower quantiles, eventually becoming insignificant at the extremely high and low quantiles. Overall, we find that the oil price is a significant predictor of the carbon price across carbon quantiles except when the quantiles are extremely low or high.We now present the result from the causality-in-quantile test, which identifies the causal effects of energy prices on carbon prices.

        <p>As for natural gas prices, the causality is statistically significant at most quantiles (approximately from 0.1-to 0.9-quantile level) (see Figure 7(b)). It indicates that gas prices can consistently Granger cause carbon prices on the normal market conditions. The inverted U -shaped trajectory of causality presents evidence of a significant causality from lower to upper quantile levels, implying a sound predictive power of natural gas prices at most market conditions except at the extreme market states. Moreover, as presented in Figure 7(c), the range of significant area of the Granger causality-in-quantile from coal prices to carbon prices is a bit smaller than that of oil and natural gas prices. The ridge-shaped curve implies the existence of strong predictability around normal market conditions; the magnitude declines quickly as we move to extreme quantiles. On the whole, causality-in-quantiles test enriches our understanding of the causal impacts of energy prices on carbon prices under different carbon market states.

        <p>The literature has investigated the energy price impacts on carbon prices in Phases I and II of the EU ETS (see, e.g., Mansanet-Bataller et al., 2007;Alberola et al., 2008;Creti et al., 2012;Zhang and Sun, 2016).

        <p>We find that energy price impacts on carbon prices are asymmetric and generally negative across carbon-energy price distributions. Our findings of the variable impact of energy prices across the price distributions can be explained by changing market conditions (high or low carbon price quantiles) and the nature of price shocks (e.g., oil, natural gas, and coal). When the economy is strong with high carbon price levels, the impacts of energy prices on carbon prices are less intense in comparison to a state when the economy is weak with low carbon price levels (in absolute terms). Specifically, the oil price impacts on carbon prices increase from low to high carbon price quantiles, and are governed by the channel of the aggregated carbon demand effect.We find that energy price impacts on carbon prices are asymmetric and generally negative across carbon-energy price distributions.

        <p>In the coal market, the impacts of coal prices are jointly driven by both channels of the aggregated carbon demand effect and the fuel switching mechanism in the same direction. Its impact pattern is similar to that of oil prices and demonstrates a quasi-monotonic rise with increases in carbon price quantiles. Absolute values of coal price impacts are greater than that of oil price impacts, especially at high carbon quantiles. As for the natural gas price, its impacts are also led by the two channels but in opposite directions. Absolute values of the gas price impacts tend to be flatter and smaller compared with both oil and coal price impacts. Our interpretation on the carbon and energy price relationship is further enriched by the causality-in-quantiles test as we identify a significant causality from prices of the three energy sources to carbon prices except at a small range of extreme carbon quantiles.In the coal market, the impacts of coal prices are jointly driven by both channels of the aggregated carbon demand effect and the fuel switching mechanism in the same direction.

        <p>Our findings possess useful implications for policymakers and practitioners (such as market investors and regulated installations). From the perspective of policymakers, a precise interpretation of the marginal energy price impacts on carbon price dynamics can help contribute to an effective environmental regulatory process for a significant control of carbon emissions and sensible policy guidance towards the healthy and prosperous market development in Phase III. Our results indicate that differential policy implementations across carbon-energy price distributions rather than a uniform policy can prove fruitful. Specifically, given that rises in both oil and coal prices lead to a substantial fall in carbon prices when they are low led by the two effect-transmission channels, it indicates that higher oil and coal price levels are effective in dampening carbon consumption at low carbon quantiles. The result suggests levying taxes on prices of the two energy sources and their related products in a bust carbon market as effective policies to reduce the fossil pollution and carbon emissions, through which a tendency to adopt clean-energy sources is further prompted. Moreover, while negative, the price impacts of natural gas on carbon prices are negligible compared to that of oil and coal in absolute terms. Thus, adding taxes to gas prices would not effectively decline carbon consumption and its prices potentially due to the substitution between gas and coal in the power generation driven by the fuel-switching mechanism.Our findings possess useful implications for policymakers and practitioners (such as market investors and regulated installations).

        <p>From investors' standpoint, the asymmetric negative impact of energy prices on carbon prices is important for risk management. Assuming a constant carbon-energy price relationship may lead to an inappropriate financial decision making. Instead, an effective hedging strategy should account for the asymmetry of the relationship across the entire data distribution and its variations over time. Since carbon prices behave a strong negative linkage with oil and coal prices at low carbon quantiles, it offers an effective approach to diversify the risk of adverse price fluctuations associated with the investors' portfolios, especially in periods of economic turmoil. In addition, introducing the pricing mechanism of carbon allowances has changed the cost structure of regulated installations. Thus, an accurate interpretation of the variable energy price impacts on carbon prices over the data distribution can help the regulated sectors minimize carbon and energy-related production costs and meet their carbon reduction targets in the compliance period.From investors' standpoint, the asymmetric negative impact of energy prices on carbon prices is important for risk management.
