        <p>Climate change is one of most subject of intense investigation and discussion because of the point of views economic, social and political narrowing the perception on our influence in the sensitive climate equilibrium of the world. In the past few years, the field of photocatalysis has gained considerable importance in environmental technologies, due to the possibility of using solar irradiation to activate chemical processes, destroy undesired compounds, or generate chemical energy, such as in hydrogen production from H 2 O.

        <p>However, due to its large band-gap (3.2 eV), anatase TiO 2 only absorbs UV light, which accounts for 4-5% of the solar spectrum; therefore, extensive studies are required to identify more suitable visible light-sensitive photocatalysts. [4][5] A precise understanding of the morphology of semiconductor materials is critical to identify the correlations between crystalline structure, activity, and technological applications; the latter can be improved and stabilized by tailoring the surface structures and exposed crystal faces of the material. [6][7][8][9][10][11][12] The preparation of semiconductor oxides crystals with tunable morphologies is based on the control of the exposed surfaces. It is well known that the strong dependence of the surface energy (E surf ) on the surface orientation can be understood from the viewpoint of different distributions of the surface atoms on the exposed surfaces appearing at the morphology, as atomic distribution strongly influences the surface electronic structure. In this context, semiconductors can vary from highly conductive to nonconductive, and can be highly photocatalytically active or inactive depending upon the different electronic structure of the different surfaces. [13][14] In fact, several studies have been devoted to explain the wide connection between morphology, electronic structure, and photocatalytic properties, and the rational design of facet-dependent synthesis has emerged as an excellent tool to select surfaces with superior activities for much kind of materials. 10,[15][16][17] Silver oxide (Ag 2 O) has proved its efficiency in a wide range of technological applications such as photocatalysis, bactericides, colorants, and electrode materials. [18][19][20][21] In particular, experimental evidences highlighted the strong dependence of its photocatalytic activity on the presence of exposed (100), (110), and (111) surfaces. In this context, facet-dependent photocatalytic processes are associated with the shape and size of Ag 2 O particles, and the cubic, octahedral, rhombic dodecahedral, and rhombicuboctahedral morphologies appear favorable to obtain superior activities. 13-14, 20, 22-24 In addition, the importance of oxygen vacancies for manipulating the electronic properties of metal oxides is well established in water splitting applications; [25][26] in particular, structural and electronic disorder, primarily in the form of oxygen vacancies, cation stoichiometry, and atomic diffusion processes play a major effect on the electronic properties of Ag 2 O. [27][28][29][30][31] From a theoretical point of view, some studies aimed to understand the photocatalytic properties of Ag 2 O focusing on the electronic structure of the semiconductor. [32][33][34][35][36] Umezawa et al. compared the photocatalytic performance of Ag 3 PO 4 and Ag 2 O and reported that carrier separation is effective on Ag 2 O (100) and (110) surfaces. 36 In other studies, the electronic structure of several Ag-based oxides were compared focusing on the band-gap region and the orbitals associated with the photoinduced processes.

        <p>The main novelty of this work lies in the identified correlation of the morphology and electronic structure of both bulk material and exposed surfaces (appearing in the morphology) with the photocatalytic activity. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, we aim to provide insight on the geometrical and electronic nature of Ag 2 O bulk based on explicit and realistic models. The second goal is to rationalize the experimental results and understand the origin of the photoactivity by identifying the nature of the photoinduced carriers and the shape-dependent photocatalytic mechanism. We provide robust theoretical evidences that such dependence is intrinsically associated with the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers. This paper contains three more sections. The next section is devoted to the computational methods and model systems. In section three, the results are presented and discussed. The main conclusions are summarized in the fourth and final section.The main novelty of this work lies in the identified correlation of the morphology and electronic structure of both bulk material and exposed surfaces (appearing in the morphology) with the photocatalytic activity.

        <p>As it was previously mentioned, the values of the E surf for the different exposed surfaces of a crystal are the key parameters that control their morphology and may affect the photocatalytic performance that should be rationally selected. In order to evaluate the physical and chemical properties associated with Ag 2 O surfaces, a slab model was employed. In particular, the chemical structure of each surface was described as a twodimensional periodic film formed by atomic layers parallel to the (hkl) crystalline plane of interest, cut from the optimized bulk geometry of the selected (100), (110), and (111) surfaces. In this context, we ascertain that (110) and (100) surfaces are polar, i. e. containing two slab terminations, which cannot be made equivalent. Then, we have used a theoretical procedure to obtain the values of E surf without surface reconstructions, chemical adsorptions or polarity compensation mechanism. [42][43] In this context, Tian et al. 44 confirmed that asymmetric and stoichiometric slabs are the most suitable choice to take into account the calculation of cleavage energy for complementary Z + /Z - terminations and its relaxations, arguing that the reported method here for the calculation of E surf could be extended to other similar systems with asymmetric surface terminations. 45 In the present study, E surf was assumed to correspond for surface cleavage (E cleav ). Therefore, firstly, we introduce the concept of unrelaxed E cleav as the required energy to cut the bulk along the selected plane.As it was previously mentioned, the values of the E surf for the different exposed surfaces of a crystal are the key parameters that control their morphology and may affect the photocatalytic performance that should be rationally selected.

        <p>During a typical photocatalytic process, charge generation under semiconductor photoexcitation takes place; thus it is imperative to characterize the corresponding excited electronic states that largely determines the overall performance of a photocatalyst. Both singlet (s*) and triplet (t*) excited states of Ag 2 O were localized and characterized for both bulk and surface models, following the approach previously developed by our group. 48,[51][52] For s* model, we considered an off-center Ag displacement of 0.1 Å in the z-direction. In the present case, the t* state was modeled by fixing the difference between the spin-up (α) and spin-down (β) electron densities (nα -nβ = 2) during the selfconsistent field calculations. Each excited state minimum was confirmed by checking that all vibrational modes had positive frequencies. DFT calculations using the B3LYP functional tend to overestimate the values of the vibrational frequencies; therefore, a scaling factor of 0.96 was used. 53During a typical photocatalytic process, charge generation under semiconductor photoexcitation takes place; thus it is imperative to characterize the corresponding excited electronic states that largely determines the overall performance of a photocatalyst.

        <p>The calculated structural parameters (lattice constants, unit cell volume, and bond distances) of Ag 2 O are summarized in Table 1. In the cubic symmetry model of the Ag 2 O, the lattice is composed by Ag + cations in a linear (180°) arrangement with two oxygen atoms and each oxygen anion is surrounded by four Ag + cations (O 4c ) in a tetrahedral polyhedron. This structure is in reasonable agreement with previous experimental results 54 and theoretical calculations performed with HSE06 hybrid functional. 32 From now on we discuss the electronic structure of pristine and defective Ag 2 O models based on the analysis of the density of states (DOS) and band structure profiles, presented in Figure 2. For pristine Ag 2 O (Figure 2a), the valence band (VB) was composed of 4d Ag orbitals hybridized with O (2p) states, while the conduction band (CB) was mainly composed of empty 5s Ag orbitals. The band-gap was calculated as 2.07 eV, corresponding to a - direct transition, in good agreement with the experimental 20,[22][23]55 and theoretical values.

        <p>Photo-driven processes one of most promises since first quantum experiments to understand the light and matter interaction. The high energy concentration inside the photon is a great option to help the environmental treatment from new production or remediation processes. Recently, photocatalytic and photovoltaic devices have been extremely searched for applications in the conversion of energy from light, electricity (solar cells) or chemical (photocatalysis, water splitting, CO 2 reduction, and others) technologies 64 These technologies, require the knowledge on semiconductor electronic structure, which controls a complex sequence of events initiates from light adsorption process followed by the conduction of the photo-induced charge carriers and interaction with other chemical species. The general mechanism behind such processes can be separated in three steps: (i) light adsorption for automatically to generate the electronhole (e'-h ⦁ ) pair; (ii) charge carriers diffusion; (iii) the transference of the charge carrier to a molecule. In the first step, the energy of the light must be equal to or higher than the band-gap in order to promote an electron (e') from the VB to the CB, creating an electron vacancy in the VB, denoted as hole (h ⦁ ). For solar-driven photocatalysis, the optimum band-gap ranges between 1.6 and 2.5 eV, this corresponds to the solar spectrum. [65][66][67][68] In this context, Ag 2 O is a suitable candidate for solar-driven photocatalysis due to its bandgap of 2.07 eV (Figure 2a). The e'-h ⦁ pair interacts through Coulomb attraction and plays a fundamental role in the subsequent steps, controlling the photocatalytic efficiency of the semiconductor. In steps (ii) and (iii), the e' and h ⦁ must be separated to generate free charge carriers that are transported to active sites very well defined, where they will be active for photocatalysis before the recombination. 65 The diffusion coefficient (D) reflects the mobility of a charge carrier, which in turn is linked to its effective mass (m * ). In particular, D increases as the effective mass of the photo-generated carrier decreases, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.Photo-driven processes one of most promises since first quantum experiments to understand the light and matter interaction.

[65][66][67][68] In this context, Ag 2 O is a suitable candidate for solar-driven photocatalysis due to its bandgap of 2.07 eV (Figure 2a). The e'-h ⦁ pair interacts through Coulomb attraction and plays a fundamental role in the subsequent steps, controlling the photocatalytic efficiency of the semiconductor. In steps (ii) and (iii), the e' and h ⦁ must be separated to generate free charge carriers that are transported to active sites very well defined, where they will be active for photocatalysis before the recombination. 65 The diffusion coefficient (D) reflects the mobility of a charge carrier, which in turn is linked to its effective mass (m * ). In particular, D increases as the effective mass of the photo-generated carrier decreases, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the ratio between the effective masses of electrons (m e * ) and holes (m h * ) is a powerful tool to predict the stability of the e'-h ⦁ pair with respect to the recombination process. In this case, different effective mass for electrons and holes induces different mobilities for such charge carriers, reducing the e'-h ⦁ recombination rate and increasing the photocatalytic efficiency due to the structural separation. 65,[67][68] The effective mass can be associated with the curvature at the top of the VB or at the bottom of CB. For a single isotropic and parabolic band, the effective mass can be obtained as:Furthermore, the ratio between the effective masses of electrons (m e * ) and holes (m h * ) is a powerful tool to predict the stability of the e'-h ⦁ pair with respect to the recombination process.

        <p>Figure 7 shows three different reaction paths starting from the ideal morphology of Ag 2 O. In reaction path (A), a rhombicuboctahedral shape was obtained via truncation of the octahedral morphology in order to predominantly expose the highly reactive ( 100) and ( 110) surfaces, with a minor proportion of (111) surfaces. In terms of the thermodynamic stability associated with E pol (Supplementary Information, Table S1), the final morphology showed a rather similar stability to the ideal octahedral shape. In reaction path (B), two potential photocatalytic morphologies (cubic and edge/cornertruncated cubic), exposing mainly the (100) and (110) surfaces, were obtained by truncation at both the edge and corner sides of the ideal octahedral shape. The obtained cubic shape, which was exposed only (100) surfaces, showed a lower E pol than the ideal Ag 2 O shape, denoting a higher stability, which would make it suitable for photocatalytic applications. Finally, in reaction path (C), morphologies with higher E pol were obtained by truncation of the octahedral ideal shape because of the stabilization of the (110) surface to generate rhombic dodecahedral shapes. Therefore, along both reaction paths (A) and (B), the most stable shapes (rhombicuboctahedral and cubic) exhibited higher proportions of both (100) and (110) surfaces, and were the most promising candidates with enhanced photocatalytic activities.

        <p>In this section, we propose a general photocatalytic mechanism connecting the crystal morphology and electronic structure of Ag 2 O. Different crystal surfaces exhibit distinct VBM and CBM energy levels, due to the different atomic arrangements exposed on the surfaces. This difference can directly lead to the localization of photo-induced e'h ⦁ pairs, favoring their separation and reducing the e'-h ⦁ pair recombination rate.

Therefore, we can argue that h ⦁ centers will accumulate on (100) and (110) surfaces, while electrons will migrate to the energetically favorable (111) plane. In order to confirm these results, we calculated the atomic charges for both Ag and O atoms using the Mulliken charge (Supplementary Information, Table S2). In this context, it is important to remark that Mulliken charge is used to disclose the local charge accumulation/depletion for the excited states in comparison to the fundamental ground state. In bulk Ag 2 O, the Ag and O centers possessed net charges of 0.44 and -0.84 |e|, respectively.

        <p>The results for s* excited electronic state in Figure 10a,c indicate a slight perturbation in the VBM and CBM, with band-gap values of 2.06 and 2.24 eV for bulk and (111) surface, respectively. On the other hand, the DOS profiles for t* excited electronic state (Figure 10b,d) indicate that the spin separation along the crystalline structure promoted a non-degenerate spin distribution in the vicinity of the VBM for both bulk and (111) surface.

        <p>In this case, it should be noted that the band-gap for excited bulk model is similar to previously discussed values, showing an excitation around 2.03 eV, whereas the (111) surface presented a reduced band-gap value around 1.61 eV. The above results can be attributed to the e' -h • pair separation process after the photo-induced excitation, owing to the reduced band-gap values for the (111) surface in the excited t* electronic state; then, the photoexcited e' centers were mainly trapped in the clusters exposed on (111) surface, while the h ⦁ centers were located in the bulk and in the metallic (100) and (110) surfaces. Those facts confirms the aftermentioned properties evaluated by means of Mulliken charge analysis and spin density distribution, confirming that the simulation of excited states plays a fundamental role on the understanding of photo-induced properties.In this case, it should be noted that the band-gap for excited bulk model is similar to previously discussed values, showing an excitation around 2.03 eV, whereas the (111) surface presented a reduced band-gap value around 1.61 eV.

        <p>An additional information about the surface reactivity can be addressed to the Hard or Soft character of acid/bases (HSAB). Here, such information was computed by considering the Chemical Hardness (η) of the Ag 2 O surfaces, considering that η can be computed as the difference between LUMO (CBM) and HOMO (VBM) frontiers crystalline orbitals in the framework of Koopaman's Theorem. 79 In the fundamental ground state the chemical hardness of (100), ( 110) and (111) surfaces were calculated as 0.0, 0.0 and 2.26 eV, respectively. Therefore, (100) and (110) surfaces are soft in comparison with (111). However, for the excited s* and t* states the chemical hardness of (100) and (110) was maintained, while the calculated values for (111) surface (2.24 eV and 1.61 eV) indicates a softening behavior.An additional information about the surface reactivity can be addressed to the Hard or Soft character of acid/bases (HSAB).

        <p>From a fundamental point of view, the photocatalytic generation of radical species can be considered as a redox process. Therefore, both oxidation and reduction sites need to be located on the reactive and exposed surfaces. In this context, the electronic band structure of a semiconductor photocatalyst can be tuned by exposing specific surfaces, with a significant impact on the redox abilities of photo-induced carriers. [80][81][82][83][84] As discussed above, the first step in the photocatalysis mechanism is the photo-induced electronic transition following absorption of light with energy equal to or greater than the band-gap energy of Ag 2 O; the transition generates an e' -h • pair, following the reaction described in the Equation 7. In this case, the superscript "x" correspond to the neutral nomenclature of Kröger-Vink notation, while subscripts "o" and "d" nomenclature refers to the existence of both ordered and distorted clusters, respectively.From a fundamental point of view, the photocatalytic generation of radical species can be considered as a redox process.
