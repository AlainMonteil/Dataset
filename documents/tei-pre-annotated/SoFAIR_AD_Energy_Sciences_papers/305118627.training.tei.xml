        <p>Electrolyzers combining CO2 reduction (CO2R) with organic substrate oxidation can produce fuel and chemical feedstocks with a relatively low energy requirement when compared to systems that source electrons from water oxidation. Here, we report an anodic hybrid assembly based on a (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) electrocatalyst modified with a silatrane-anchor (STEMPO), which is covalently immobilized on a mesoporous indium tin oxide (mesoITO) scaffold for efficient alcohol oxidation (AlcOx). This molecular anode was subsequently combined with a cathode consisting of a polymeric cobalt phthalocyanine on carbon-nanotubes to construct a hybrid, precious-metal-free coupled AlcOx-CO2R electrolyzer. After three hour electrolysis, glycerol is selectively oxidized to glyceraldehyde with a turnover number (TON) of 1000 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% and the cathode generated a stoichiometric amount of syngas with a CO:H2 ratio of 1.25±0.25 and an overall cobaltbased TON of 894 with a FE of 82%. This prototype device inspires the design and implementation of nonconventional strategies for coupling CO2R to less energy demanding, and value-added, oxidative chemistry.Electrolyzers combining CO2 reduction (CO2R) with organic substrate oxidation can produce fuel and chemical feedstocks with a relatively low energy requirement when compared to systems that source electrons from water oxidation.

        <p>The electrosynthesis of fuels is being pursued as a potential solution to intermittent electricity production via renewable wind and solar technologies. [1] Conventional electrolyzers couple the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode to a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or CO2R at the cathode. [2,3] However, the kinetic hurdles of the anodic four-electron process and consequently large overpotential for the OER, tied to the limited commercial value of O2, are spurring interest in employing more synthetically useful and facile organic oxidative reactions. [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Recent technoeconomic studies have shown that 90% of the overall energy requirements for current commercial approaches in CO2 electrolysis stem from the OER, and that lower cell potentials for fuel-generating reductive chemistry can be achieved by substituting the OER for AlcOx. [12] In particular, by combining theory and experiment, it was shown that glycerol, a biomass-derived platform chemical and a byproduct from the production of biodiesel and soap, [13,14] is an attractive candidate which can greatly improve the economics of the overall redox process.The electrosynthesis of fuels is being pursued as a potential solution to intermittent electricity production via renewable wind and solar technologies.

        <p>Reports on tandem AlcOx-CO2R electrolyzers suffer from two main drawbacks to date. [7,9] Firstly, precious metal-containing components are employed in the electrolysis cells. Secondly, homogeneous catalysts and mediators are required in excess in the solution, which complicates post-reaction processing of the liquid products. The use of catalysts in solution presents an additional challenge during electrosynthesis in that only a tiny fraction of the catalyst (positioned in the Helmholtz layer) can turnover, while the rest remains inactive in the bulk.Reports on tandem AlcOx-CO2R electrolyzers suffer from two main drawbacks to date.

        <p>Metal oxide (MOx) electrodes present an interesting platform for catalyst immobilization and offer a number of advantages such as affinity for a variety of anchoring units, and the possibility to morphologically tune the surface to enhance the loading of molecular components. [18,19] MOxs can exhibit different electronic properties, as demonstrated by the metallic behavior of ITO and the semiconductive properties of TiO2, thus offering a versatile electroactive platform to combine with surface-anchored molecular catalysts. [20,21] Several mechanistic studies have highlighted the effect of pH on the TEMPO catalytic cycle, with enhanced oxidation rates recorded under more basic conditions. [22][23][24] This stringent criterion implies that some of the more commonly used anchoring groups compatible with MOx scaffolds, such as carboxylic acids and phosphonic acids (pH stability &lt; 4 and 7, respectively), [25] may not be suitable for TEMPO immobilization on an ITO electrode. We therefore designed STEMPO, where a silatrane unit offers increased linker stability under more alkaline conditions, [26,27] a result of the strong siloxane bonds being formed upon hydrolysis of the caged moiety on the MOx surface (Figure 1). STEMPO was synthesized in good yield by reacting the acyl chloride of 4-carboxy-TEMPO with 3-aminopropylsilatrane. Full synthetic and characterization details (highresolution mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy (Figure S1) and elemental analysis) are provided in the Supporting Information.Metal oxide (MOx) electrodes present an interesting platform for catalyst immobilization and offer a number of advantages such as affinity for a variety of anchoring units, and the possibility to morphologically tune the surface to enhance the loading of molecular components.

        <p>The best mixture consisted of a STEMPO solution (2 mM) with 2%(v/v) acetic acid (AcOH) and 1%(v/v) H2O in acetonitrile (MeCN). With regards to stability of the immobilized STEMPO compound, MeCN was the most suitable solvent from those attempted (Figure S3). The combination of AcOH and H2O facilitated the hydrolysis of the silatrane cage on the mesoITO surface, [28] and was deemed necessary for instigating the anchoring process (Figure S4 andS5). Optimal STEMPO was thus typically found to be 20-25 nmol cm -2 , which is in the expected range for nanostructured ITO surfaces. [29,30] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed binding signals in the Si2p and N1s regions (Figure 2a and Figure S6, respectively), where the Si2p signal agrees with XPS reference spectra for the siloxane-bearing group. [31] Multiple CV scans of the mesoITO|STEMPO electrode reveals a reversible redox wave at E1/2 = 0.83 V vs. NHE (Figure 2b), which corresponds to the nitroxide/oxoammonium species, and is only slightly more positive than that of TEMPO (E1/2 = 0.74 V vs. NHE, Figure S7a). At low scan rate (10 mV s -1 ), the peak-to-peak separation is below 20 mV and is thus in good agreement with the ideal value of 0 mV for a reversible response of a surface-adsorbed species (Figure S7b). The full width at half-maximum is 116 mV (Figure S7b), only slightly broader than the theoretically predicted value of around 91 mV for a 1 e -process (at 25 °C).

        <p>A deeper analysis of the electron-transfer dynamics of the mesoITO|STEMPO system was inferred using the Laviron method, [35] which relies on the change in the peak potential (Ep) with scan rate (). The resulting trumpet plot for the mesoITO|STEMPO assembly is portrayed in Figure 2c. The intercepts of the linear regions of the plot can be used to deduce the critical scan rate (c) and the apparent electron transfer rate constant (kapp) for the system (see Supporting Information for further details). Values for c and kapp were determined to be equal to 72 ± 2 mV s -1 and 0.68 ± 0.02 s -1 , respectively. The rate of electron transfer appears to be slow (hence the low value for c), but is comparable with other covalently linked redox species in the literature. [36] Figure S8 depicts the CV scans measured over a range of scan rates to highlight the change in the peak-to-peak separation for the STEMPO redox wave as the applied scan rate exceeds c. The linear relationship between the peak current (ip) and , for  &lt; c (Figure 2d) is characteristic for a surface-immobilized redox entity. [32] The pH stability of the mesoITO|STEMPO assembly was investigated using a multi-scan CV approach, whereby the electrode was subjected to several redox cycles in solutions of differing pH (Figure 2e and Figure S9). Very good stability was obtained after 200 scans at pH 7 and 8 (decrease in signal intensity of 34% and 39%, respectively, relative to scan 1), and the decay curve only began to be more severe at pH 10. These results support that the assembly is suited to operate under the basic conditions required for enhanced TEMPO catalysis.A deeper analysis of the electron-transfer dynamics of the mesoITO|STEMPO system was inferred using the Laviron method, [35] which relies on the change in the peak potential (Ep) with scan rate ().

        <p>(Supporting Information). [37] The combined FE-EPR spectroelectrochemical technique allows for the appearance and disappearance of paramagnetic species to be monitored as a function of the applied potential in the absence of any mediators. The high electrical conductivity combined with the surface-modification properties of ITO make it a suitable platform for carrying out FE-EPR spectroscopy. Carbon-based electrodes tend to give rise to large radical signals and are thus unsuitable for such studies. [37] For FE-EPR spectroscopy, cylindrical mesoITO (C-mesoITO) electrodes were employed for use in the EPR spectroelectrochemical cell. The unpaired electron in the TEMPO moiety is delocalized around the N and O atoms with nuclear spins (I) of 1 and 0, respectively, and thus only couples with N nuclei. This interaction gives rise to a triplet pattern in which the peaks, for the case of a diffusional species tumbling rapidly in solution at room temperature, are all the same intensity (EPR spectrum for diffusional TEMPO presented in Figure S10a, black trace). A triplet pattern is also discernible for the C-mesoITO|STEMPO assembly, but the peak intensities are distorted in this case (Figure S10a, red trace). This change in line-shape of the EPR spectrum relative to the diffusional case arises from a slower tumbling rate which can be a consequence of the impaired mobility of the TEMPO moiety upon STEMPO immobilization. [38] Figure 2f highlights the results from the FE-EPR investigation. C-mesoITO|STEMPO samples were poised at a particular potential, using a three-electrode setup, and then flash-frozen to allow for low-temperature EPR characterization. Examples of EPR spectra, at three different potentials, are presented in Figure 2f (inset) (full range in Figure S10b), where an increase in the applied bias is accompanied by a drop-in signal intensity, that eventually vanishes due to the oxidation of the radical to EPR-silent 10.1002/anie.202002680(Supporting Information).

The current density increases with increasing pH, accompanied by a lower onset potential for catalysis (from 0.75 V at pH 7.3, to 0.68 V at pH 10, vs. NHE), which is comparable to previous reports for immobilized TEMPO on carbon-based electrodes. [40,41] This observation is in-line with the established TEMPO-mediated oxidation mechanism, whereby alcohol deprotonation leads to formation of a pre-oxidation complex via nucleophilic attack of the alkoxide on the electrophilic nitrogen of the oxidized TEMPO moiety (the oxoammonium cation), prior to aldehyde formation. [41][42][43][44] However, the enhancement starts to plateau between pH 9 and pH 10, contrary to what is observed for TEMPO, and related nitroxyl derivatives, in solution. [44] The plateau shown in Figure 3a for the mesoITO|STEMPO system could be due to a combination of factors, and we rationalize this behavior to stem from the relatively slow electron transfer between the ITO electrode and immobilized STEMPO, as well as from mass transport limitations of the substrate in the mesoporous network.Figure 3a depicts the catalytic behavior of the system as a function of the solution pH, where 4-methylbenzylalcohol (MBA) was chosen as a model substrate.

        <p>On either side of the maximum, there is a corresponding decrease in the TON. At lower pH, this can be attributed to a slower rate of substrate oxidation thereby resulting in less nMBAd, whereas higher pH adversely affects the stability of the mesoITO|STEMPO assembly, likely leading to a loss of the catalytic sites on the electrode over reaction time. Post-CPE (at pH 8) XPS conducted on the mesoITO|STEMPO electrode reveals peaks in the Si2p and N1s regions (Figure S12), similar to those observed on a freshly assembled electrode (Figure 2a and Figure S6), and thus indicates that the gradual drop in activity could be primarily due to hydrolysis of the amide bond (and subsequent loss of the TEMPO moiety from the assembly).On either side of the maximum, there is a corresponding decrease in the TON.

[46] Figure 3c and 3d depict concentration profiles obtained for glycerol and HMF, respectively, and the concentration profile for MBA is shown in Figure S13a (corresponding 'maximum current density vs. concentration' plots for these three substrates are presented in Figure S13b-d). PP-ol was poorly soluble in pure aqueous electrolyte, and thus a CV trace for this compound was recorded in a MeCN-water mixture (Figure S14). The estimated TOFs for the four compounds, and the relevant experimental conditions, are summarized in Table S2. The results show that the mesoITO|STEMPO system can be used to oxidize a variety of alcohol-based substrates, with the primary benzylic alcohols MBA and HMF showing highest activity (TOF = 0.677 and 0.680 s -1 , respectively), followed by the aliphatic triol glycerol (0.557 s -1 ). The results from this analysis therefore signify the use of low-cost and abundant alcohols like glycerol for electrocatalytic applications with the mesoITO|STEMPO electrode. PP-ol gave the lowest TOF (0.268 s -1 ), which agrees with the expected trend that primary alcohols are oxidized more rapidly than secondary alcohols by TEMPO in basic solution.

From the traces shown in Figure 5b, there is an alteration in the CO:H2 ratio at the cathode over time, which seems to be a consequence of the decrease in the absolute value of ECE. This decrease in the reducing potential at the cathode is itself a result of the gradual decline in activity at the anode over time.

        <p>In conclusion, we have designed, fabricated and characterized an anode featuring a silatrane-modified TEMPO molecule on a mesoITO scaffold, and demonstrated the electrocatalytic ability of the hybrid MOx system to efficiently oxidize a variety of biomass representative substrates. The siloxane anchor, formed upon hydrolysis of the silatrane cage on the MOx surface, displays robust binding. The catalytically active site (i.e. the oxoammonium cation) is both stable and readily regenerated under electrocatalytic conditions, [53] and we believe that the long-term stability of the hybrid electrode assembly is currently limited by the amide bond in STEMPO.

        <p>We further showed the advantage and versatility of our novel STEMPO anode by coupling alcohol oxidation with an efficient CO2R cathode (CP|CNT-CoPPc) to construct a fully molecular, precious-metal-free, AlcOx-CO2R electrolyzer. The functionality and performance of the device was investigated using a three-electrode configuration, first employing MBA as a model substrate, and later, using the commercially applicable substrate, glycerol. It was found that in both cases, stoichiometric amounts of a selective oxidation product (the corresponding aldehyde) and syngas were generated at the anode and cathode, respectively. FEs were typically excellent for the hybrid system, exceeding 80% for both anode and cathode. TONs were also high, approaching 1000 for mesoITO|STEMPO and 900 for CP|CNT-CoPPc (with glycerol as substrate). The TON of the cathode in the electrolyzer is currently limited by the prolonged stability issue of the anodic assembly during continuous CPE experiments and the CoPPc-cathode on its own is known to maintain activity over a longer time-period. [17] Further studies were then made using a demonstrator-type, twoelectrode setup for coupled glycerol oxidation at the anode and syngas generation at the cathode, showing similarly promising metrics as per the three-electrode setup. Cell energy efficiency calculations also revealed the advantages of operating at a lower Vcell , with a maximum efficiency of 18% being measured at a cell potential of 1.9 V. This molecular hybrid system is therefore a suitable model for the development of future AlcOx-CO2R electrolyzers based on earth-abundant materials, which can provide chemical feedstocks (aldehydes and syngas) from sustainable and abundant resources, such as biomass-derived alcohols, CO2, and renewable electricity.

This molecular hybrid system is therefore a suitable model for the development of future AlcOx-CO2R electrolyzers based on earth-abundant materials, which can provide chemical feedstocks (aldehydes and syngas) from sustainable and abundant resources, such as biomass-derived alcohols, CO2, and renewable electricity.
