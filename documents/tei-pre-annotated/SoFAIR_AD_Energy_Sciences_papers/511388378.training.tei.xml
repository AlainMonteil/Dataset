        <p>Nanomaterial such as metals and metal oxide photocatalysts have emerged as important tools for removing contaminants from wastewater and as antibacterial agents to prevent infections; this is mainly due to their stability under different irradiation conditions. Herein, the catalytic and antimicrobial activities of nanocrystalline silver (Ag), supported on tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) nanoparticles prepared using the deposition-precipitation synthesis technique, are studied. The synthesized material was characterized as XRD, XPS, TEM, and TEM-EDS to investigate their physio-chemical properties. HRTEM, XPS analysis shows that the photocatalyst has a large sheet-like morphology with well-dispersed small metallic Ag particles (&lt;3 nm) on the WO 3 nanoparticle's surface, with most particles near the edges. Ultraviolet-visible spectra analysis observed a large redshift in the absorbing band edge and decreased bandgap energy from 2.6 to 2.1 eV. Photocatalytic analysis at different concentrations of 1% Ag/WO 3 under visible light indicated a high degradation efficiency. The largest degradation efficiency of Methylene Blue (MB) under visible light irradiation was (~80%) in 120 min at 1 g/L catalyst dosage. The photodegradation of MB under visible light as a function of catalyst dose followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics. In addition, the catalyst shows high degradation efficiency and significant dose-dependent inhibition of Gram-negative E. Coli and the Gram-positive S. aureus. Furthermore, the catalyst showed excellent stability and recyclability.Nanomaterial such as metals and metal oxide photocatalysts have emerged as important tools for removing contaminants from wastewater and as antibacterial agents to prevent infections; this is mainly due to their stability under different irradiation conditions.

        <p>Recent studies suggest that contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, phenolic compounds, and dyes are found in water sources, while microorganisms grow in water and on surfaces. Phenolic derivatives, polycyclic aromatic compounds, extractants, analytical reagents, and dyes are all organic pollutants found in the environment [1]. Dyes such as MB are among the most harmful pollutants released from textile, paint, paper, and plastic industries [2]. Photocatalysts have received considerable attention in recent years due to their environmental and biomedical application. Using a photocatalyst such as TiO 2 shows great promise for destroying contaminants and microorganisms under various irradiation conditions. Heterogeneous metal and metal oxide semiconductor photocatalysts have been widely used in water and air pollutants abatement. Furthermore, they show excellent efficiency in removing organic pollutant dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation [3,4]. The popular antibacterial activity of metals (Ag, Au, and Cu) along with the visible light-activated reactive oxygen species production in semiconductor metal oxide (ZnO, WO 3 , and TiO 2 ) nanocomposites promises enhanced antibacterial and antiviral activities [5][6][7]. Photocatalytic activity is highly dependent on the ability of the catalyst to create electron-hole pairs. This process generates free radicals (hydroxyl radicals: ⋅OH) that can undergo secondary reactions. Organic compounds such as bacteria and viruses or toxic materials can be effectively degraded and combusted into CO 2 and H 2 O through photocatalysis using semiconducting nanoparticles. Metal oxide nanoparticles such as TiO 2 , zinc oxide (ZnO), and tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) have been extensively used for degrading bacteria and viruses or toxic contaminants by exposing them to UV light illumination [8]. TiO 2 is a well-known photocatalytic material and has been used commercially. Even though TiO 2 is cost-effective, stable, and corrosion resistant, its high bandgap energy of 3.2 eV, which requires high UV irradiation for excitation, limits its application in the visible-light region of the solar spectra. As an alternative, WO 3 is a nontoxic, chemically, and photochemically stable semiconductor in aqueous media over many pH values. WO 3 is an n-type tungsten oxide semiconductor with a narrow bandgap in the range of (2.6-2.8 eV) eV [9,10], and it can be activated by visible light irradiation [11]. Tungsten oxide can form different compounds (i.e., WO 3 , WO 2 , and none-stoichiometric oxide) due to the presence of multiple oxidation numbers [12]. As a result, WO 3 can possess several excellent photocatalytic, chemical, electrical, and antibacterial properties [13][14][15][16]. However, due to the high recombination rate of the photogenerated (e -/h + ) pairs, WO 3 has limited long-term photocatalytic activity. Recently, researchers have been focusing on visible light photocatalysis that constitutes a significant share (~46%) of the solar spectrum compared to UV light (~7%) [17]. Photocatalysis using visible light has been reported to be possible by doping semiconductors with transition metals to reduce the effective bandgap [18]. Several metallic elements have been used as a dopant to modify the electronic structure and surface properties of WO 3, extending their visible light region absorbance and the photocatalyst's lifetime. This process is achieved by trapping photogenerated electrons to create valence band (VB) holes that oxidize the organic molecules rather than consuming them in a recombination reaction [19,20]. Ag supported on metal oxides such as ZnO showed significant photocatalytic activities under different irradiation conditions and dark [21,22]. The damaged cell membrane and DNA degradation were observed only under illumination due to the photocatalytic electron injection process, while inactivation in the dark is primarily attributable to Ag and ZnO's bactericidal effect ions [22]. Ag plays a vital role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of WO 3 activity due to improved charge separation and electron-hole recombination reduction. Ag nanoparticles' localized surface plasmon resonance absorption leads to visible light photocatalytic activity [23][24][25][26]28].Recent studies suggest that contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, phenolic compounds, and dyes are found in water sources, while microorganisms grow in water and on surfaces.

Elemental analysis confirms the presence of silver in the Ag/WO 3 composite. The EDS spectra consist of different Ag, C, Cu, S, O, and W peaks.

        <p>HRTEM results are depicted in Fig. 3. It is clearly shown that the irregular shape and size of particles with the majority of WO 3 particles exhibit sheet-like morphology with a size larger than 500 nm and very few spherical particles about 150-200 nm. HRTEM revealed that the Ag nanoparticles are composed of highly dispersed and tiny silver nanoparticles (&lt;3 nm), and large Ag particles with the size of 3-10 are anchored and dispersed on the WO 3 surface nanosheets [30], as shown in Fig. 3(a and b). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 3(c)) was performed to confirm the existence of Ag in WO 3 further, which clearly showed the existence of a combination of the spots, as observed in Fig. 3 (c), where the more substantial spot is attributed to underlying crystalline WO 3 , confirming the presence of well-crystallized Ag particles [31]. These results complement the XRD results. The analysis of HRTEM images Fig. 3(d-f) confirms that the lattice fringe spacing of Ag-doped WO 3 is 3.8 nm for crystal plane [020] [23] and 3.64 nm for the crystal plane [002], corresponding to the lattice planes of WO 3 with the monoclinic structure [32]. XPS was used to study and analyze the chemical states and compositions of the Ag/WO 3 nanoparticles' surface, where the photocatalytic reaction mostly occurs. The XPS profiles of Ag/WO 3 are shown in Fig. 4, which indicates the chemical components and the corresponding binding energy levels. Fig. 4 (a) depicts the full scan profile of the materials' total composition, which showed W, Ag, and O, while C and a small amount of Na were probably due to contamination in the sample. The high-resolution XPS spectra of W 4f, Ag 3d and O 1s were deconvoluted and shown in Fig. 4 (b)-(d), respectively. Two spin-orbit doublets for W valence state W 4f 7/2 and W 4f 5/2 are observed at 35.8 eV and 37.9 eV, respectively, with 2.1 eV doublet splitting. Deconvolution of W 4f 5/2 and W 4f 7/2 spectra showed mostly W 6+ peak present at 35.8 eV and 37.9 eV, respectively, suggesting tungsten stoichiometric tungsten. XPS peak analyses of Ag 3d in the fresh sample clearly show the silver consists mainly of metallic silver with two spin-orbit doublets corresponding Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 at binding energy values of 368.3 eV and 374.3 eV, respectively, with 6.0 eV doublet splitting [33]. The large splitting of the Ag 3d doublet of 6.0 eV suggests that the Ag exists in the form of metallic Ag. Deconvolution of Ag 3d 5/2 and Ag 3d 3/2 spectra showed Ag0 (metallic Ag) presence at binding energies of 368.3 eV and 374.3 eV, respectively. Similar results were reported previously [34]. The O 1s spectrum exhibited a peak at a binding energy of 530.6 and fit well with the oxygen bound to W 6+ in the stoichiometric WO 3 phase [35]. These results confirm a small fraction of metallic silver dispersed in the NPS, as was shown in SEM, EDS, and TEM analysis.HRTEM results are depicted in Fig. 3. It is clearly shown that the irregular shape and size of particles with the majority of WO 3 particles exhibit sheet-like morphology with a size larger than 500 nm and very few spherical particles about 150-200 nm. HRTEM revealed that the Ag nanoparticles are composed of highly dispersed and tiny silver nanoparticles (&lt;3 nm), and large Ag particles with the size of 3-10 are anchored and dispersed on the WO 3 surface nanosheets [30], as shown in Fig. 3(a and b). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 3(c)) was performed to confirm the existence of Ag in WO 3 further, which clearly showed the existence of a combination of the spots, as observed in Fig. 3 (c), where the more substantial spot is attributed to underlying crystalline WO 3 , confirming the presence of well-crystallized Ag particles [31]. These results complement the XRD results. The analysis of HRTEM images Fig. 3(d-f) confirms that the lattice fringe spacing of Ag-doped WO 3 is 3.8 nm for crystal plane [020] [23] and 3.64 nm for the crystal plane [002], corresponding to the lattice planes of WO 3 with the monoclinic structure [32].

        <p>The pretreatment (calcination) effect is a necessary parameter to study, as it is mainly used to eliminate volatile compounds, water, or oxidize a substance, which is known as a purification process. This was proven by Imam and Chopra, where they found that the Ag/WO 3 band gap was significantly lowered upon pretreatment, implying better photocatalytic activity [44]. High-temperature heat treatment causes WO 3 to produce oxygen vacancy defects. These defects reduce the bandgap of 1% Ag/WO 3 and improve photogenerated carriers' separation efficiency, resulting in high photocatalytic activity [45]. In this work, the effect of pretreatment was studied by performing photocatalytic degradation of aqueous MB solution on calcined/not calcined 1% Ag/WO 3 under visible light irradiation for 60 min reaction time in the presence of 0.1 M NaBH 4 .

        <p>To fully comprehend the enhanced photocatalytic activity, further research into the photocatalytic mechanism is needed. Here, it is discussed in detail in terms of the work functions. According to the literature, the work functions of WO 3 and Ag are 5.7 eV and 4.26 eV, respectively. As Ag comes into contact with WO 3 , electrons can transfer from Ag to WO 3 's CB, achieving Fermi level equilibration. As a result, excess electrons accumulate on the surface of WO 3 , while excess positive charge accumulates on the surface of Ag, forming a deflexed energy band at the Ag/WO 3 interface. Furthermore, the deflexed energy band in the space charge region enables the rapid transfer of the as-excited electrons from WO 3 to Ag nanoparticles, which reduces the recombination of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Since WO 3 has a low CB level that is more positive than the given potential for the singleelectron reduction of O 2 , the multi-electron reduction of O 2 will move electrons accumulated at Ag nanoparticles to surface-adsorbed oxygen molecules to form H 2 O 2 [49].To fully comprehend the enhanced photocatalytic activity, further research into the photocatalytic mechanism is needed.

        <p>The following steps summarize the proposed mechanism for MB degradation (Fig. 10). First, visible light irradiation allows electrons in the VB to transfer into the CB. Consequently, holes (h + ) and electrons (e -) are formed at the surface of the WO 3 photocatalyst. Oxygen vacancy defects then trap the photogenerated electrons on the surface. Then, the holes react with hydroxide ions, while electrons react with dissolved oxygen to produce OH • , which breaks down MB dye into harmless gases like carbon dioxide and water. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide reacts with electrons to produce more OH • to speed up the dye's decomposition.The following steps summarize the proposed mechanism for MB degradation (Fig. 10).

Oxygen vacancy defects then trap the photogenerated electrons on the surface. Then, the holes react with hydroxide ions, while electrons react with dissolved oxygen to produce OH • , which breaks down MB dye into harmless gases like carbon dioxide and water. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide reacts with electrons to produce more OH • to speed up the dye's decomposition.</p>
        <p>Antibacterial activity of 1% Ag/WO 3 was tested against two bacterial strains of Gram-negative E. Coli and the Gram-positive S. aureus. The suspension test method was utilized to test for antibacterial activity of 1% Ag/WO 3 in light and dark conditions at different concentrations (0-1 g/L). Fig. 11 illustrates the results of the antibacterial activity of 1% Ag/WO 3 toward E. coli. And S. aureus growth inhibition under ambient light and in dark conditions. Fig. 11 shows dose-dependent inhibition in bacterial growth upon exposure to different concentrations of 1% Ag/WO 3 for both S. aureus and E. Coli under light and dark conditions. As the concentration increased, the bacterial growth decreased compared to the normal growth curve in E. coli and S. aureus (Fig. 11). This suggests a specific effect of the 1% Ag/WO 3 nanoparticle. It has been noticed that 1% AgWO 3 nanoparticles exhibited a better bactericidal effect on Gramnegative bacteria (E. coli) than the Gram-positive (S. aureus). This difference might be due to the differences in the cell wall structure.Antibacterial activity of 1% Ag/WO 3 was tested against two bacterial strains of Gram-negative E.

        <p>Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall composed of many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids, whereas Gram-negative bacteria cell walls are relatively thin with an outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides and lipoprotein bilayers [50]. Therefore, the thick Gram-positive bacteria cellular wall might limit the uptake of the nanoparticle drug or resist drug exposure, in contrast to the Gram-negative bacteria [51]. The mechanism of action of antibacterial 1% Ag/WO 3 nanoparticles is not well understood. However, the electrostatic attraction between bacterial cells and nanoparticles was determined to play a crucial role. The attraction between the positively charged Ag nanoparticles and the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane confer the electrostatic attraction, facilitating Ag nanoparticles' attachment and entry into the cell membrane [52]. A previous study using E. coli demonstrated that Ag nanoparticles penetrate through the membrane and disrupt protein synthesis, leading to structural changes and death [53]. In addition, another study investigated the effect of silver nanoparticles on the growth, permeability, and morphology of E. coli. The results suggest that silver nanoparticles damaged the bacterial cell membrane structure and reduced the activity of membranous enzymes, eventually leading to bacterial death [54]. Therefore, further analysis and testing using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) needs to be performed to fully understand the mechanism of action of 1% Ag/WO in dark and light conditions.Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall composed of many layers of peptidoglycan and teichoic acids, whereas Gram-negative bacteria cell walls are relatively thin with an outer membrane with lipopolysaccharides and lipoprotein bilayers [50].

        <p>Metallic Ag NPs and the Ag + it releases are both effective antibacterial agents. Although the specific antibacterial mechanism is unclear, several potential theories include the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the breakdown of cell walls and/or membranes. Two factors contribute to the antibacterial performance of 1% Ag/WO3 composite. First, the interaction of 1% Ag/WO3 composite with the surface of bacteria disrupted the bacterial cell wall, allowing Ag NPs and Ag + ions to enter. Once inside the bacteria, Ag NPs and/or Ag + ions interact with many targets simultaneously, including enzymes, DNA, and proteins, through various metabolic pathways, disrupting cell metabolic function and triggering bacteria death. Second, 1% Ag/WO composite could result in the generation of ROS. Oxidative stress is caused by species such as O 2 -, H 2 O 2 , and OH • in excessive concentrations; bacteria can then suffer substantial damage, leading to cell death [55].Metallic Ag NPs and the Ag + it releases are both effective antibacterial agents.

        <p>Nanocrystalline silver (Ag), supported on tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) nanoparticles, were successfully synthesized via the depositionprecipitation synthesis technique, which was composed of mainly monoclinic sheet-like morphology tungsten oxide (&gt;500 nm) with a few spherical particles (&lt;200 nm), and small (&lt;3 nm) and well-dispersed metallic silver nanoparticles on the surface as confirmed by XRD, TEM-EDS, and XPS. Furthermore, the deposition of Ag onto the WO surface reduces the bandgap energy (from 2.6 to 2.1 eV at 1% Ag loading), evidenced by a redshift and visible radiation emission as confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The prepared heterogeneous 1% Ag/WO 3 photocatalyst demonstrated significant MB degradation under visible light compatible with the degradation level under UV light radiation. Dose-dependent MB photodegradation kinetics followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics suggesting that the photocatalytic activity scales up with catalyst dose. Moreover, the photocatalyst demonstrated effective dose-dependent inhibition against Gram-negative E. Coli and the Gram-positive S. aureus under ambient light and dark conditions, with a stronger effect under light. The effective dispersion of Ag within the WO3 support enhanced the electron-hole pair separation rate by entrapping and transferring the photo-excited electrons, which increased the reactive species that aid the degradation efficiency and inhibition of bacterial growth. Overall, the Ag/WO 3 photocatalyst demonstrates excellent stability and recyclability, photocatalytic activity, and antibacterial properties, making it applicable in many applications such as water purification and surface sterilization under visible light and dark conditions.Nanocrystalline silver (Ag), supported on tungsten oxide (WO 3 ) nanoparticles, were successfully synthesized via the depositionprecipitation synthesis technique, which was composed of mainly monoclinic sheet-like morphology tungsten oxide (&gt;500 nm) with a few spherical particles (&lt;200 nm), and small (&lt;3 nm) and well-dispersed metallic silver nanoparticles on the surface as confirmed by XRD, TEM-EDS, and XPS.
