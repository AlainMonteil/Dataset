        <p>This paper investigates the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on carbon emissions and economic performance based on a matching methodology exploiting installation-level inclusion criteria combined with difference-in-differences. Installation-level data from national Polluting Emissions Registries in France, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom point to a reduction in carbon emissions in the order of -10% between 2005 and 2012, in line with existing micro and macro evidence. Meanwhile, firm-level data on the 31 ETSregulated countries shows that the EU ETS had no significant impact on profits and employment, and led to an increase in regulated firms' revenues and fixed assets. We explore various explanations for these findings. ☆ The paper received funding from the European Commission through the Pagoda programme, grant agreement N • 07.0203/2016/746184/ SUB/ENV.A2 ("Investigating the links between environmental policies, firm behavior and economic outcomes").

        <p>Emissions trading programs have assumed an ever more prominent role in environmental policy over the last few decades. In 2021, the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) was still the largest cap-and-trade program in the world by traded value. 1 The EU ETS was launched in 2005, allocating tradable emissions permits to over 12,000 power stations and industrial plants in 31 countries, accounting for over 40% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions.Emissions trading programs have assumed an ever more prominent role in environmental policy over the last few decades.

        <p>Between 2005 and 2012, verified emissions by regulated installations were reduced by 17% at constant scope, 2 but this reduction might not have been caused by the EU ETS, because many other factors affected emission trends, such as the economic crisis of 2008, fuel prices and business-as-usual industrial trends. These factors, combined with relatively low carbon prices on the EU ETS market, have led many to wonder whether emissions would have been higher without the policy (Martin et al., 2016).Between 2005 and 2012, verified emissions by regulated installations were reduced by 17% at constant scope, 2 but this reduction might not have been caused by the EU ETS, because many other factors affected emission trends, such as the economic crisis of 2008, fuel prices and business-as-usual industrial trends.

        <p>The paper contributes to the growing empirical literature on the impacts of environmental policies, and of climate change policies in particular, on environmental and economic performance. Overall, this nascent literature shows that environmental regulations tend to improve environmental performance while not weakening economic performance (Dechezleprêtre and Kruse, 2018; Dechezleprêtre et al., 2019). The literature focusing on the competitiveness effects of environmental regulations has found that environmental policies can lead to statistically significant adverse effects on trade, employment, plant location and productivity in the short run, in particular in a well-identified subset of pollution-and energy-intensive sectors, but that these impacts are temporary and small relative to general trends in production (Dechezleprêtre and Sato, 2017).The paper contributes to the growing empirical literature on the impacts of environmental policies, and of climate change policies in particular, on environmental and economic performance.

        <p>The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents some background information on the EU ETS and provides some description of emissions trends. Section 3 surveys the evidence on the impact of the EU ETS on carbon emissions and economic performance. In section 4 we present a causal analysis regarding the impact of the EU ETS on carbon emissions using installation level data. In section 5 we estimate the impact of the EU ETS on the economic performance of regulated firms based on financial data. Section 6 concludes by considering some of the potential policy implications of our findings, and directions for future research.The paper proceeds as follows.

        <p>The EU ETS was launched in 2005. It currently covers 30 countries across Europe (all 27 European Union Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). 3 Currently, the EU ETS covers around 10,000 power stations and industrial facilities, representing roughly 40% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions. As in any cap-and-trade system, at the end of each year EU ETS installations are required to surrender as many permits as they emit GHG-emissions. Prior to the compliance date, installation operators can freely trade permits with each other (as well as with financial intermediaries and private citizens).The EU ETS was launched in 2005.

        <p>The EU ETS has been divided into a number of trading phases, with successively more stringent emissions caps for each phase. For the first phase, the emissions cap was fixed at 2298 Mt CO2e per year. Fig. 1 plots the emission caps along with the verified emissions over time of all regulated installations based on the emissions data from the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), the European Commission's centralized carbon emissions inventory which records emissions of all regulated installations. As can be seen from Fig. 1, the verified emissions of installations covered by the EU ETS have been declining over time. One of the objectives of this paper is to understand whether this decrease can be attributed to the EU ETS or whether it is the result of a longer lasting trend or of other factors.The EU ETS has been divided into a number of trading phases, with successively more stringent emissions caps for each phase.

        <p>Phase 1, running from 2005 to 2007, was insulated from later phases by prohibiting banking of permits across the phase boundary. Fig. 1 indicates an oversupply of permits in the first phase (with total allocation greater than verified emissions), which is why the permit price approached zero at the end of the first trading period (see Fig. 2). Phase 2 (2008-2012) and Phase 3 (2013-2020) allow firms to bank unused permits for later use, as well as a limited form of borrowing4 against future emissions reductions. This explains why the price has remained above zero despite over-allocation, and also why verified emissions exceeded the cap in 2008. With Phase 3, the coverage of the EU ETS also became broader and previously unregulated sectors such as aviation and the production of aluminium became regulated. 5 Fig. 2 presents the price of EU ETS allowances between 2005 and 2015. The average spot price in this period was around €10-15, but has varied between €0 and €30. In the beginning of the third phase, the spot price has ranged between €5-7. 6 Hintermann et al. (2016) discuss the main price-drivers in the EU ETS, such as fossil fuel prices, economic growth, weather, marginal abatement costs and uncertainty. If companies see a (real) option value in holding allowances for future compliance, they may abate emissions at a marginal cost exceeding the carbon price. Or inversely, barriers to investment may lead to marginal abatement costs below the carbon price. So, although the carbon price is observed, the induced abatement remains an empirical question.Phase 1, running from 2005 to 2007, was insulated from later phases by prohibiting banking of permits across the phase boundary.

        <p>To understand if the declining trend in emissions observed in Fig. 1 is a consequence of the EU ETS, we first take a casual look at aggregate trends. Since the EUTL does not include emissions data before the introduction of the EU ETS, we use data from the national GHG inventory of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which provides carbon emissions data at the sector level for all Annex I countries from 1990 to 2014. Under the UNFCCC, each country is required to report its national greenhouse gas inventory on an annual basis according to a standardized methodology developed by the Conference of the Parties (COP) 7 which makes inter-country comparisons possible. The inventory report covers all emissions and removals of direct GHGs at a disaggregated sectorial approach. We retrieve emissions from the six sectors with the highest emissions: electricity and heat; petroleum refining and coke production; metals including iron and steel; chemicals; pulp and paper; and non-metallic minerals. 8 Merging the UNFCCC emissions with the data from the EUTL allows us to calculate sector-specific EU ETS coverage rates. These are displayed in Fig. 3. The electricity and heat sector has the highest coverage rate by the EU ETS with 82% of emissions regulated. This is followed by the pulp and paper sector (78%) and the mineral sector (75%) while the chemical sector displays the lowest coverage rate with 42%. As is clear from Fig. 3, the EU ETS only covers a part of each sector's emissions, implying that there exist many installations which are not covered by the EU ETS and, thus, can serve as a potential control group in the causal analyses presented in Sections 4 and 5.To understand if the declining trend in emissions observed in Fig. 1 is a consequence of the EU ETS, we first take a casual look at aggregate trends.

        <p>Fig. 4 presents the trend in emissions in the six main sectors covered by the EU ETS. To compare the sectors with each other, we normalize emissions in the year 2005 to 100. Fig. 4 suggests that emissions have been declining more rapidly after the implementation of the EU ETS in each and every sector. However, we cannot claim that the EU ETS has been causing this decline in emissions because it Source: EUTL and UNFCCC, own calculations. Sectors are defined by the ETS regulation and by UNFCCC guidelines could have been driven by other factors, particularly by the global financial crisis in 2009, which was associated with a massive drop in emissions across all sectors. The installation-level analysis presented in section 5 sheds light on this issue. Martin et al. (2016) review the literature on ex-post evaluation of the EU ETS on emission reductions and distinguish between two different approaches to estimate business-as-usual (BAU) emissions: estimates based on aggregate emissions and estimates based on emission data at the firm or plant level.Fig. 4 presents the trend in emissions in the six main sectors covered by the EU ETS.

        <p>Aggregate emissions at the sector level have been used to estimate the counterfactual BAU emissions for the first trading period (2005-2007). Based on different data sources, these studies find EU-wide emission reductions between 2.5% and 5% (Ellerman and Buchner, 2008; Anderson and Di Maria, 2011; Ellerman et al., 2010). For Germany, Ellerman and Feilhauer (2008) estimate emission reductions of 5% and, in the electricity sector in the UK, McGuinness and Ellerman (2008) find emission reductions of 17%. While taking into account observed factors such as GDP, these studies estimate a post-ETS counterfactual by extrapolating pre-ETS emission intensity trends, which makes it difficult to claim causality. More recently, Bayer and Aklin (2020) use a generalized synthetic control approach which allows them to construct a counterfactual emissions path for sectors covered under the EU ETS. They find that EU ETS sectors emitted 11.5% less than they would have in a world without the EU ETS (thus, on top of any emission reductions from reduced economic output induced by the 2007/2008 financial crisis). In addition, their results suggest that the effect of the EU ETS was greater in the second phase (starting in 2008) than in the first phase (2005-2007).Aggregate emissions at the sector level have been used to estimate the counterfactual BAU emissions for the first trading period (2005-2007).

        <p>Five studies to date have included observed emissions by both regulated and non-regulated plants, before and after the start of the ETS, to provide causal estimates of the effect of the EU ETS on regulated installations' carbon emissions. The five studies are based on data from a single country, France, Germany, Norway, Lithuania and the UK respectively. Using plant-level data for around 9500 French manufacturing firms, Colmer et al. (2022) show that ETS-regulated manufacturing firms in France reduced emissions by an average of 8-12% compared to a control group of similar but unregulated firms. All of the impact occurs during Phase II, a period during which allowance prices fluctuated between €15 and €30. Petrick and Wagner (2014) use comprehensive panel data from the German production census. They find evidence that phase II of the EU ETS caused regulated plants to reduce their emissions by around 25% compared to non-regulated plants. Klemetsen et al. (2020) exploit plant-level data from the Norwegian Environment Agency for the period 2001 to 2013. They find weak evidence that regulated plants may have reduced emissions by a large amount (-30%) in the EU ETS ′ second phase, but no evidence that emission intensity decreased in any of the phases. Next, Jaraite and Di Maria (2016) analyse the impact of the EU ETS on CO2 emissions and economic performance in Lithuania for the period 2005-2010 using plant-level data. They find no reductions in emissions and a slight improvement in emissions intensity in 2006-2007. Finally, Calel (2020) exploits a specific policy feature in the UK, where some firms entered the EU ETS a few years later because they were regulated by pre-existing climate policy. He finds that the EU ETS did not lead to an improvement in firms' carbon intensity between 2005 and 2012.

        <p>Compared with the existing literature, this paper is the first multi-country study based on installation-level emission data. It combines emission data from four countries, starting with a larger database than existing single-country studies, spanning the different national contexts. This allows us to provide the first cross-country micro-level evidence and to provide a robust estimate based on a carefully selected set of installation pairs that are most comparable. We also report results using our entire (non-matched) database of 2683 installations.Compared with the existing literature, this paper is the first multi-country study based on installation-level emission data.

        <p>The introduction of carbon pricing in Europe generated wide concerns about the potential cost burden on industry. Model-based studies predicted that with carbon prices around €20-€30/tCO2, the marginal cost impacts would be small for the large majority of industrial activities, but large impacts could occur in upstream segments within several energy-intensive sectors, including fertilizers, iron and steel, aluminum, paper, basic organic chemicals or coke oven production (Sato et al., 2014).The introduction of carbon pricing in Europe generated wide concerns about the potential cost burden on industry.

        <p>Early micro-level studies either determined treatment status at the sector level (Commins et al., 2011), incorrectly labelling firms operating unregulated installations as treated, or matched EU ETS firms with firms in non-EU ETS sectors (Abrell et al., 2011), thus failing to control for sector-specific time-varying factors.Early micro-level studies either determined treatment status at the sector level (Commins et al., 2011), incorrectly labelling firms operating unregulated installations as treated, or matched EU ETS firms with firms in non-EU ETS sectors (Abrell et al., 2011), thus failing to control for sector-specific time-varying factors.</p>
        <p>In contrast to these earlier studies, Chan et al. (2013) estimate the impact of the EU ETS on economic outcomes by comparing firms regulated under the EU ETS with unregulated firms in the same sector. However, they cover only three sectors (cement, steel and power production) over a relatively short period (2001-2009). They find no impact on economic variables in cement and iron and steel industries, but a significant positive effect on revenue in the electricity sector, which could be explained by cost pass-through.In contrast to these earlier studies, Chan et al.

        <p>The four studies mentioned above based on data from France, Germany, Norway or Lithuania also analysed the causal effect of the EU ETS on various economic performance outcomes. Venmans, Ellis and Nachtigall (2020) and Martin et al. (2016) give a detailed overview of this literature. The general picture is as follows. More often than not, empirical studies conclude that the ETS increased investment (Marin et al., 2018; Colmer et al., 2022) and productivity (Marin et al., 2018; D'Arcangelo et al., 2022;; Klemetsen et al., 2020; Lundgren et al., 2015). 9 Regarding turnover and value added, the picture is more mixed. Large increases are found by Klemetsen et al. (2020) in Norway and by Petrick and Wagner (2014) in Germany, while other studies find insignificant results. 10 When considering employment, most studies find an insignificant effect.The four studies mentioned above based on data from France, Germany, Norway or Lithuania also analysed the causal effect of the EU ETS on various economic performance outcomes.

        <p>Overall, therefore, only a handful of studies have used micro-data and quasi-experimental techniques to analyse the causal effect of the EU ETS on regulated firms' economic (and environmental) performance. However, these studies have mostly looked at different countries individually, two of them with a very small number of covered installations. They have also looked at different outcome variables based on data availability.Overall, therefore, only a handful of studies have used micro-data and quasi-experimental techniques to analyse the causal effect of the EU ETS on regulated firms' economic (and environmental) performance.

        <p>The only exception is Marin et al. (2018), who use a similar identification strategy as Chan et al. (2013), but add matching. This means that only the most similar non-ETS firms serve as a comparison to the ETS-firms and that ETS firms without a reasonable comparator are excluded. They investigate the manufacturing sector (representing 32.8% of all ETS emissions) in 19 countries. However, whereas they identify 3445 manufacturing EU ETS firms in ORBIS, accounting for 88% of the EU ETS manufacturing emissions, we were able to identify 8200 EU ETS firms, representing 99% of all emissions. This significantly reduces the risk of using an ETS firm as a control firm. We also include all sectors in all countries participating in the ETS. This results in 1787 ETS firms in our matched sample, which is much larger than Marin et al. (2018)'s matched sample of 759 ETS firms. Our larger sample allows us to test the heterogeneity of results according to company size, region and sector, and to add extra consistency checks such as controlling for country-and sector-specific trends, different treatments of missing variables and different definitions of sectors. Thus, compared with the available literature, our paper offers a more systematic analysis of the impact of the EU ETS on firms' economic and environmental performance on the largest possible sample.The only exception is Marin et al.

        <p>To establish a causal relationship between the implementation of the EU ETS and the environmental and economic performance of regulated entities, we exploit a special design feature of the EU ETS, namely the sector-specific inclusion thresholds based on production capacity. In order to minimize administrative costs, sector-specific capacity criteria determine which installations are included in the EU ETS and which installations are exempt from the regulation. For instance, only combustion installations with a rated thermal capacity exceeding 20 MW are covered; steel plants are included if their production capacity exceeds 2.5 tons per hour; glass and glass 9 Commins et al., 2011 find a negative effect on investment and total factor productivity in the EU, while Löschel et al., 2019, find an insignificant result on total factor productivity in Germany. 10 Colmer et al.

        <p>fiber plants are included only if their melting capacity exceeds 20 tonnes per day, etc. Since inclusion criteria are based on the capacity of the plant and not on the company, multi-plant companies may have a total capacity above these thresholds, while each installation individually stays below the threshold. This design feature makes it possible to (1) compare regulated and unregulated installations and single-plant firms around the inclusion threshold, and (2) compare firms whose individual installations' capacity is below the inclusion threshold (and therefore are unregulated) with firms operating at least one installation above the threshold (therefore regulated), but otherwise similar.11 With this, we can construct a quasi-experimental design setting which allows for assessing the causal impact of the EU ETS.fiber plants are included only if their melting capacity exceeds 20 tonnes per day, etc. Since inclusion criteria are based on the capacity of the plant and not on the company, multi-plant companies may have a total capacity above these thresholds, while each installation individually stays below the threshold.

        <p>Ideally, we would like to compare installations that are similar in all dimensions prior to the implementation of the EU ETS so that it becomes difficult to explain away any difference in the outcome by other factors than the EU ETS. We try to obtain this by matching each ETS entity to similar non-ETS entity. First, we apply exact matching on country and sector at the 3-digit level of the NACE Rev. 2 industry classification.12 This ensures that matched entities are subject to very similar regulatory environments (other than the EU ETS) and face similar economic environments (demand conditions, input prices, etc.). Next, we also match on continuous variables. Since we have two different datasets, one to assess the effect on emissions and another one to assess economic impacts, we use two different matching strategies.Ideally, we would like to compare installations that are similar in all dimensions prior to the implementation of the EU ETS so that it becomes difficult to explain away any difference in the outcome by other factors than the EU ETS.

        <p>Our emissions dataset at installation level does not include data on capacity or on actual output; therefore, we use pre-ETS emissions as a proxy for both. More precisely, we match on the mean of pre-ETS emissions as well as on the pre-ETS emission growth rate, in order to account for emissions trends that were already present before the ETS was launched. If a similar installation cannot be found, the observation is excluded (we use a caliper of 0.3 on log-transformed variables, imposing a maximum difference of 35%). We apply full matching, meaning that one treated installation can be matched to many control installations and vice versa. 13 Thus, each matched pair consists either of one ETS installation matched to one or several control installations or of one non-ETS installation matched to one or several treated ones. 14 Using the same installation for more than one matched pair allows for a larger number of matches which, in turn, translates into a larger sample size, thereby increasing efficiency. This is particularly important when the sample size is rather small. The drawback of this procedure is that the average distance between an installation and its matches is larger.Our emissions dataset at installation level does not include data on capacity or on actual output; therefore, we use pre-ETS emissions as a proxy for both.

        <p>For the economic performance dataset at the firm level, we use data from the pre-regulation period 2002-2004 to assign each EU ETS firm to the closest possible firms in terms of revenue, fixed assets, number of employees and EBIT (earning before interests and taxes, i.e. operating profit or loss). The similitude on these four criteria is based on the Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the correlation between the criteria. We impose a minimum similitude using a caliper of 0.85. Here also, we restrict ourselves to more closely resembling firms, excluding a number of EU ETS companies for which no good match can be found (for example, we cannot find an electricity production company in France which is of a similar size as EDF, so EDF is left out of the matched sample).For the economic performance dataset at the firm level, we use data from the pre-regulation period 2002-2004 to assign each EU ETS firm to the closest possible firms in terms of revenue, fixed assets, number of employees and EBIT (earning before interests and taxes, i.e. operating profit or loss).

        <p>Here, we apply one-to-one matching with replacement, selecting only the single closest non-ETS firm for each ETS firm and allowing that a non-ETS firm can serve more than once. One-to-one matching leads to a higher similitude between treated and control firms (small bias) at the expense of a smaller dataset of unique observations (lower efficiency). This focus on small bias is justified by our large firm-level dataset compared to our installation-level emission dataset.Here, we apply one-to-one matching with replacement, selecting only the single closest non-ETS firm for each ETS firm and allowing that a non-ETS firm can serve more than once.

        <p>It is important to note that, as part of the matching procedure across both datasets, we give up a potentially much larger sample in favour of a more focused comparison from which we are able to draw causal estimates of the impact of the EU ETS. What is lost in sample size, however, is regained in terms of accuracy and robustness (Dehejia and Wahba, 1999). This is the main advantage of matching over standard regression. In doing so, our estimates pertain by construction to smaller firms and plants in the EU ETS (which have unregulated comparators) rather than to regulated plants generally. In statistical terms, given that matching with calipers only uses entities in (or close to) the area of common support, our baseline results estimate a local average treatment effect (LATE) with a higher weight placed on smaller companies, rather than the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). For this reason, we test for heterogenous treatment effects across plant and firm size. We find that larger installations experience relatively larger emission reductions. This means that the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated is likely larger than the Local Average Treatment Effect and that our baseline estimator probably underestimates the true ATT. For our analyses on economic performance, we find relatively small differences between larger and smaller companies.It is important to note that, as part of the matching procedure across both datasets, we give up a potentially much larger sample in favour of a more focused comparison from which we are able to draw causal estimates of the impact of the EU ETS.

        <p>where Y it is the outcome variable (installation-level emissions or firm-level turnover, assets, number of employees, EBIT or return on assets); ETSpost it is a dummy variable equal to 1 whenever a company is regulated in a given year.

Year dummies denoted by θ t capture any shock that is common to all installations, such as macroeconomic fluctuations or changes in international energy prices. In the analysis of economic performance, these year effects are both country-specific and sector-specific. 15 Our main results estimate equation (1) using Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood. In the appendices, we also use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), in which case we use the log of the dependent variable. We also compare closures between ETS and non-ETS firms in 2014 (the final year in our sample) using a probit model. We do not use a panel structure in this case, because both ETS firms and control firms are operating in 2005 by design and closure is irreversible in our data.where Y it is the outcome variable (installation-level emissions or firm-level turnover, assets, number of employees, EBIT or return on assets); ETSpost it is a dummy variable equal to 1 whenever a company is regulated in a given year.

        <p>Abadie and Spiess (2022) demonstrate that the standard errors of regression coefficients in matched samples without replacement are consistent provided that they are clustered at the level of the matched sets. The intuition behind this result is that matching on covariates makes regression errors statistically dependent among units in the same matched set. Clustering at the matched set level accounts for this dependency. In our panel setting, this also corrects for serial correlation. However, the result of Abadie and Spiess (2022) only holds for matching without replacement. There is to the best of our knowledge no consistent estimator for standard errors for matching with replacement. 16 However, following Colmer et al. (2022), we reduce the effect of the dependence of errors of repeated observations by using two-way clustering, both on matched sets and on company-years.Abadie and Spiess (2022) demonstrate that the standard errors of regression coefficients in matched samples without replacement are consistent provided that they are clustered at the level of the matched sets.

        <p>As explained above, matching with replacement leads to lower bias in the estimates, because matches will be more alike. By using matching with replacement, we minimize bias of the coefficients, but at the price of higher standard errors.As explained above, matching with replacement leads to lower bias in the estimates, because matches will be more alike.

        <p>The main hypothesis at the heart of our difference-in-difference approach is the Parallel Trend Assumption: in the absence of the ETS, conditional on our matching covariates, the potential outcomes of ETS entities would have followed parallel trends with matched non-ETS entities.The main hypothesis at the heart of our difference-in-difference approach is the Parallel Trend Assumption: in the absence of the ETS, conditional on our matching covariates, the potential outcomes of ETS entities would have followed parallel trends with matched non-ETS entities.</p>
        <p>This assumption could be violated if governments were to develop specific policies targeting non-ETS firms, to compensate for the absence of the ETS regulation. In that case, we would underestimate the effect of the ETS on abatement. Though we cannot exclude this potential bias, we are not aware of large governmental programs specifically targeting non-ETS firms, with the exception of the French carbon tax which was introduced long after the end of our sample period.This assumption could be violated if governments were to develop specific policies targeting non-ETS firms, to compensate for the absence of the ETS regulation.

        <p>It could also be that other policies such as energy efficiency covenants, renewable energy subsidies or command and control regulation, though applicable to all firms, would affect ETS firms in a different way. For example, in our database on economic performance, emissions are unobserved. If ETS firms would have larger emissions, these other policies may have a different effect on ETS firms and our estimated ETS effect would partly be attributable to these other climate policies. However, substantial differences in emissions are unlikely because our matched companies are chosen from the same country, the same sector and have a similar size and investment capacity. To make the case that our matched sample is also similar in unobserved dimensions, we show that ETS and non-ETS firms in our matched sample have a statistically indistinguishable distribution of age (years since incorporation), initial capital (stocks), working capital, cash flows, taxes paid and credit period days. None of these variables was used to construct the matches, suggesting that matching has also achieved balance on unobserved variables, thereby recovering the central identifying condition of a randomized experiment. We also show that trends of our economic variables of interest are statistically indistinguishable before the start of the ETS. 17 Our analysis on economic performance uses firm level data rather than installation level data. Therefore, a non-ETS firm running two smaller gas power installations may be matched to an ETS firm running a single large combined-cycle gas generator. Both firms would have similar total emissions, revenue, assets, etc., but, since the smaller plants use another technology, they may react differently to a change in the gas/coal price ratio, for example, violating the parallel trend assumption. 18 Since this problem is more likely in the electricity sector, we provide estimates by sector in the appendix. Note that this is not a problem for differences which follow parallel trends, because they are filtered out by our difference-in-differences approach. For example, although carbon efficiency tends to be better in larger plants, this difference will often follow a parallel trend. 15 Identical results are obtained using equation Y it = αETS i + βpost t + γETS i *post t + δ i + θ t where ETS i is a time-invariant dummy variable equal to one for installations or firms that become regulated by the EU ETS in 2005 or later; post t is a dummy variable equal to one for the post-treatment period (2005 for most firms) and ETS i *post t is the interaction between these two variables. This specification requires two reference categories for both company and time fixed effects, to avoid perfect collinearity with the fixed effects. 16 For example, bootstrapping allows for consistent standard errors for matching without replacement (Abadie and Spiess, 2022), but not for matching with replacement (Abadie and Imbens 2008). 17 Pre-ETS trends in emissions are also statistically indistinguishable, but that is not a placebo test because trends were used in the matching algorithm. 18 We thank a referee for this meaningful example.It could also be that other policies such as energy efficiency covenants, renewable energy subsidies or command and control regulation, though applicable to all firms, would affect ETS firms in a different way.

        <p>The parellel trends assumption implies absence of anticipation effects. For emissions, anticipation is unlikely given that most Member States allocated free emissions certificates based on historic emissions using some average over a specific period between 1990 and 2002 (Neuhoff et al., 2006), well in advance of the start of the EU ETS.The parellel trends assumption implies absence of anticipation effects.

        <p>A potential violation of SUTVA are general equilibrium effects. ETS firms and non-ETS firms operating in the same country and in the same sector may be competitors. A standard example would be that ETS firms pass-through carbon costs in their sales prices, which improves the profitability or market share of non-ETS competitors. Therefore, if SUTVA is violated, our estimates correspond to a relative competitiveness effect, adding up the effects of carbon pricing on ETS firms net of the spill-over effects on non-ETS firms. As a consequence, the absolute competitiveness gains would be even larger than our estimate. General equilibrium effects can push non-ETS emissions in both ways. Higher sales would increase their emissions, whereas green technological spill-overs would decrease their emissions. If the former dominates, the true emission reductions would be more modest than our estimate, whereas if the latter dominates, the true emission reductions would be larger.A potential violation of SUTVA are general equilibrium effects.

        <p>Another violation of SUTVA would occur if a firm would have both non-ETS and ETS installations and shift production to its nonregulated entity. To limit this problem, we define an ETS firm as a firm that owns at least one ETS installation and exclude from our non-ETS sample any company that belongs to a group which includes at least one ETS-regulated company (using the Domestic Ultimate Owner in Orbis). In the installation-level analysis, we show as a robustness check that removing ETS or non-ETS installations that belong to the same owner actually increases our estimated effect on emissions (Annex C). This indicates that within firm leakage is unlikely.Another violation of SUTVA would occur if a firm would have both non-ETS and ETS installations and shift production to its nonregulated entity.

        <p>It remains that many European installations are not directly regulated by the EU ETS, but indirectly through higher electricity prices (as regulated electricity producers pass-through costs onto their customers). Therefore, the results of the analyses have to be interpreted as the effect of being directly regulated by the EU ETS compared to being unregulated or indirectly regulated through carbon price-inclusive electricity prices.It remains that many European installations are not directly regulated by the EU ETS, but indirectly through higher electricity prices (as regulated electricity producers pass-through costs onto their customers).

        <p>In our analysis, we make use of data from several national Pollution Transfer and Release Registers (PRTR). Since the 1990s, PRTRs were established in most European countries to monitor the releases of specific pollutants to air, water and soil at the installation level, covering a wide range of industrial activities such as power generation, manufacturing, and waste treatment. Beginning in 2001, large installations also had to report their pollutant releases to the Europe-wide register (EPER, later E-PRTR). 19 The E-PRTR currently covers more than 30,000 installations that annually report their releases of 91 key pollutants including heavy metals, pesticides and greenhouse gases such as CO 2 .In our analysis, we make use of data from several national Pollution Transfer and Release Registers (PRTR).

        <p>To identify the causal impact of the EU ETS on CO 2 emissions, we need data on emissions for the period before and after the introduction of the EU ETS, and for both regulated installations and unregulated installations which can serve as a control group. The European Union Transaction Log (which reports verified emissions from installations regulated under the EU ETS) does not report information on unregulated installations. Similarly, the E-PRTR reports CO 2 emissions only for installations emitting more than 100 kilo tonnes (kt) of CO 2 per year. This very high reporting threshold means that almost all installations which report CO 2 emissions to the E-PRTR are covered by the EU ETS, leaving us with very few unregulated installations to serve as a comparison group. Therefore, we collected data from the national PRTRs of France, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom, which, unlike all other countries, have lower reporting thresholds than the European-wide registers (see Table 1). National PRTRs from these four countries include data for both ETS and non-ETS installations, and all start before the implementation of the EU ETS.To identify the causal impact of the EU ETS on CO 2 emissions, we need data on emissions for the period before and after the introduction of the EU ETS, and for both regulated installations and unregulated installations which can serve as a control group.

Table 2 indicates that installations in the four countries of our analysis only show slightly different patterns relative to the whole population of EUTL installations. Both country groups have similar average and median emissions. The distribution of emissions, number of installations, and average emissions per installation across sectors shows a broadly similar pattern. This suggests that the sample of countries that we focus on might provide a reasonable indication of what the broader impact of the EU ETS across Europe may have been, even if we stress that the validity of our findings cannot strictly speaking be extended beyond the four countries of focus.How representative are these four countries of the EU ETS as a whole?

        <p>Except for France, neither the national PRTRs nor the E-PRTR provide information on whether or not an installation is covered by the EU ETS. Hence, we link national PRTRs with the EUTL to identify which installations in the national PRTRs are ETS-regulated. To do so, we use string matching algorithms based on installations' name, zip code, and address, complemented with extensive manual verification. 20 With this, we are able to identify virtually all ETS-regulated installations in the national PRTRs, with a 99% coverage in terms of emissions.Except for France, neither the national PRTRs nor the E-PRTR provide information on whether or not an installation is covered by the EU ETS.

        <p>The EUTL data also allows us to validate the accuracy of self-reported PRTR emissions, at least for regulated installations. We expect the emissions in the EUTL to be accurate because emissions are carefully monitored and verified by third-party auditors and by the regulating authorities. The coefficient of correlation between self-reported emissions in the PRTR and verified emissions in the EUTL is 0.989 based on 8944 installation-year observations, indicating a very good quality of the PRTR data. It is worth noting that installations not regulated by the EU ETS are not subject to the independent verification of emissions as is the case with the EU ETS. Therefore, some measurement error might be present for non-ETS installations, because they should not be expected to devote the same resources as ETS installations to accurately calculate their emissions. However, this would only be a problem for the analysis if non-ETS installations would have an incentive to systematically under-report their emissions after the introduction of the EU ETS, which is unlikely since they do not face any carbon regulation. The presence of measurement error, therefore, could just make our estimates less precise, if anything. To improve the data quality, we however remove installation-year observations that we considered as unrealistic. This includes in particular 'spikes', i.e. emissions of an installation that fall by more than a certain factor from one year to the other, but increase by more than the same factor in the subsequent year or vice versa. 21 While the Dutch, Norwegian, and UK PRTRs directly report the CO 2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, the French PRTR distinguishes between total CO 2 emissions and CO 2 emissions from biofuels.

        <p>We limit the analysis to the first and second EU ETS trading periods because the coverage of the EU ETS broadened substantially in 2013 with the beginning of the third trading phase, leaving only few control observations in some sectors. Our final dataset comprises 2683 installations (1355 regulated installations and 1328 unregulated ones). Simply estimating different specifications of equation ( 1) using a basic difference-in-differences approach with plant-level fixed effects on the whole sample without matching yields nonsignificant point estimates between -4% and -7%, with p-values close to conventional significance levels (0.102-0.176, depending on the specification). 23 However, this approach does not take into account that regulated and non-regulated installations are very different from each other due to the design of the EU ETS. Since regulated installations are relatively larger by construction of the ETS, this also translates into higher emission values. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of CO 2 emissions for unregulated and regulated installations before the implementation of the EU ETS. As expected, the average emissions of ETS installations are more than ten times higher than average emissions of non-EU ETS installations. In the following, we explain how we restrict our sample to comparable ETS and non-ETS installations.We limit the analysis to the first and second EU ETS trading periods because the coverage of the EU ETS broadened substantially in 2013 with the beginning of the third trading phase, leaving only few control observations in some sectors.

        <p>Table 4 reports the matching quality in terms of the differences between ETS and non-ETS installations pre-ETS for the matching variables for the matched sample as a whole and for various economic sectors. While ETS installations have slightly higher preregulation emissions than non-ETS installations, the difference between treatment and control emissions is not statistically significantly different. This also holds true for single sectors within the matched sample. Comparing the empirical distribution of ETS with non-ETS installations, Fig. 6 indicates that there is no fundamental difference in terms of pre-ETS emissions between both sets of installations.Table 4 reports the matching quality in terms of the differences between ETS and non-ETS installations pre-ETS for the matching variables for the matched sample as a whole and for various economic sectors.

        <p>Probably the most intuitive way to assess the impact of the EU ETS is by looking at the trend of emissions for matched ETS and non-ETS installations both before and after the implementation of the EU ETS, as done in Fig. 7. Prior to 2005, ETS and non-ETS installations exhibit similar trends, and over this period, emissions of ETS installations are higher on average than those of non-ETS installations. However, this picture reverses after the implementation of the EU ETS in 2005, when emissions of non-ETS installations quickly start exceeding those of ETS installations. 25 To estimate the effect of the EU ETS, we estimate Equation (1) above on the matched sample. We use Poisson regressions instead of a log-linear regression, following the approach of Silva and Tenreyro (2006).Probably the most intuitive way to assess the impact of the EU ETS is by looking at the trend of emissions for matched ETS and non-ETS installations both before and after the implementation of the EU ETS, as done in Fig. 7.

        <p>Since pollution control is capital-intensive and typically involves high fixed costs, one might expect large installations to be more responsive to carbon pricing. For example, larger installations may be able to spread fixed costs induced by the new environmental regulation over a larger output, thus lowering the cost per unit of production. Thus, we would expect larger installations to have higher treatment effects.Since pollution control is capital-intensive and typically involves high fixed costs, one might expect large installations to be more responsive to carbon pricing.

        <p>There is an ongoing debate around the neutrality of the allocation mechanism of emission trading schemes in general (Hahn and Stavins, 2011) and the EU ETS in particular (De Vivo and Marin, 2018; Zaklan, 2016). If a company is a permit buyer, any abatement measure will allow the company to buy less permits. If a company is a permit seller, the same abatement measure allows the company to sell more of them. In the former case, the ETS imposes a cash cost, whereas in the latter it is an opportunity cost of the same magnitude. Therefore, we expect the same distribution of abatement choices independently from the allocation mechanism applied. However, this 'independence property' might not hold in a real-world trading scheme, because of transaction costs (Stavins, 1995), imperfect competition (Hahn, 1984), and behavioural anomalies such as an endowment effect (Kahneman et al., 1990; Venmans, 2016).There is an ongoing debate around the neutrality of the allocation mechanism of emission trading schemes in general (Hahn and Stavins, 2011) and the EU ETS in particular (De Vivo and Marin, 2018; Zaklan, 2016).

        <p>Our dataset allows us to examine whether the magnitude of the treatment effect differs according to the generosity of the allocation of free allowances. As a proxy for generosity, we use the ratio between the average annual amount of freely allocated certificates in the first two phases and the average of pre-ETS emissions. 27 Using pre-ETS emissions instead of actual emissions for the construction of this measure guarantees that the ratio is not confounded by emissions abatement due to the EU ETS. A ratio larger than one indicates that, on average across the two phases, free certificates exceed pre-ETS emissions. We then interact the ratio with the treatment effect variable and estimate our baseline model, including installation and year fixed effects. The coefficient of the interaction term is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level, indicating that the reduction of emissions induced by the EU ETS differs according to the allocation of free allowances. Fig. 10 illustrates this finding by plotting the size of the treatment effect as a function of the ratio of free allowances over pre-ETS emissions. At a ratio of 1.5, the expected effect of the ETS on emissions is zero.Our dataset allows us to examine whether the magnitude of the treatment effect differs according to the generosity of the allocation of free allowances.

        <p>Having established that the EU ETS has reduced carbon emissions by around 10%, we now ask whether the economic performance of regulated companies was also affected. The analysis is based on the same matching methodology but the main difference is that the economic performance data is observed at the level of companies and not installations. The working dataset is also much larger, as we are not constrained by the reporting thresholds of national pollution registries.Having established that the EU ETS has reduced carbon emissions by around 10%, we now ask whether the economic performance of regulated companies was also affected.

For eight of the countries in our sample, the company registration numbers of the installation operators were obtained directly, either from national emissions trading registries or from the European Union Transactions Log (EUTL), the EU body to which national registries report. For the remaining 23 countries in our data set that participated in the 2005 launch of the EU ETS, a combination of exact and approximate text matching methods were used to establish a link between firm data and regulatory data. This was complemented by further manual searches, and extensive manual double-checking. We also cross-check the quality of our matching with the European University Institute's Ownership Links and Enhanced EUTL Dataset Project, which provides a publicly available link between EU ETS accounts and parent companies. 32 Our linking between the EUTL and company registration numbers leaves us with over 8200 firms operating more than 12,000 installations regulated under the EU ETS, together accounting for over 99% of EU ETS-wide emissions. We then merge EU ETS firms with Bureau Van Dijk's Orbis database using the company registration numbers. From Orbis, we extract financial information on both EU ETS and non-EU ETS firms on turnover, fixed assets, profits and employment, as well as companies' core activity code at the NACE 4-digit level. Our data covers the period 2002-2014.The first step of the data construction consists in identifying companies in Europe that are regulated by the EU ETS, i.e. firms that operate at least one EU ETS-regulated installation.

        <p>We apply a cleaning procedure to the dataset before moving on to the analysis. We exclude firms with missing data before 2005 or missing NACE activity code, and firms operating in sector-country combinations with only EU ETS firms or only non-EU ETS firms. We also carefully check for outlying observations that obviously correspond to errors in the data collection (for example, a company that has 300 employees in one year, 30 the next year and again 300 the year after) and replace those values with missing values. Finally, the financial data set allows us to identify majority ownership. Using this information, we exclude non-EU ETS firms that were owner, sister company, or subsidiary to an EU ETS firm. This reduces the chance of matching two potentially dependent observations.We apply a cleaning procedure to the dataset before moving on to the analysis.

        <p>Table 6 shows that, after matching, the economic outcome variables are not statistically different between the two groups. The primary challenge for any matching study is to justify the assumption that firms that appear similar are similar in unmeasured dimensions as well-called selection on observables. A simple test of whether matching has achieved balance on unobserved variables 29 The three specifications include: First, when missing emissions data is replaced by EUTL data, the ETS effect is -16%, but since there are no EUTL data for non-ETS firms, this estimate might be biased. Second, removing the UK which leads to an effect of -17% (and significant at the 1% level). Third, removing the chemicals sector reduces the point estimate to 1% (not significant). 30 While matching on time-dependent variables is common practice in applied research (Ryan et al., 2015), it is vulnerable to bias from regression to the mean (Daw and Hatfield, 2018). This occurs when matching variables are mean-reverting towards a different mean for ETS and non-ETS firms. This would most likely underestimate the ETS emission reductions. Matching on trends may moderate this bias but can also create overconfidence because the parallel trend assumption is no longer testable (Daw and Hatfield, 2018). By taking several years as baseline, we limit concerns associated with regression to the mean (Barnett et al., 2005). 31 For example, installations in the electricity, gas and steam sector in our matched sample are mostly district or industrial heating plants. These plants are very different from and certainly not representative for large coal or gas power plants.

        <p>The most transparent and intuitive way to view the results is with the aid of a simple graph plotting the revenue, assets, employment and profit of matched EU ETS and non-EU ETS firms both before and after the EU ETS came into effect (see Fig. 12).

        <p>We observe that the trends remain roughly parallel for ETS firms and non-ETS firms for all outcome variables. Comparing the two groups of firms, however, the gap between EU ETS and non-EU ETS firms seems to widen for revenue, fixed assets and the number of employees.

        <p>In order to determine the causal impact of the EU ETS on regulated companies, we run regressions based on equation ( 1) above.

There are several ways in which the ETS can increase revenues.</p>
        <p>First, revenues can increase if companies pass through the opportunity costs of free allowances. At a price of 20€/tCO 2 and 100% cost pass through, the potential carbon opportunity costs as a percentage of gross value added can be substantial for many core sectors in the EU ETS: lime (57%), cement (40%), fertilizers and nitrogen compounds (63%), aluminium (10%), other basic inorganic chemicals (10%), refined and petroleum products (10%), basic iron and steel (8%), paper and board (7%), flat glass (7%) (ETS directive 2009/29/EC). 33 However, given that these are percentages of gross value added and that companies do not pass through 100% of the costs, our estimated increase in revenue exceeds the cost pass-through of free allowances. Note that our revenue variable is defined as operational revenue, which does not include the revenue from selling allowances, because they are considered as financial revenues.First, revenues can increase if companies pass through the opportunity costs of free allowances.

        <p>Second, the ETS may have increased product quality and sales prices. Some investments in energy efficiency, which become only profitable when carbon is priced, require new kilns, heat recovery systems and production lines in general.

        <p>Third, the EU ETS may increase quantities sold. This could come from the introduction of new products and diversification, or from ETS-induced cost reductions (especially energy costs) which would more than compensate the carbon price and enable firms to lower sales prices and expand market share. Such arguments would be in line with the Porter hypothesis, with the ETS spurring innovation and leading to positive competitiveness effects.Third, the EU ETS may increase quantities sold.

        <p>Increases in revenue were much larger in phase 2 and 3 compared to the first phase (Table E.1.), in line with the hypothesis of a gradual innovation and investment process. Our results are similar to Marin et al. ( 2018) who find that the EU ETS has increased turnover by 15%. In their study, value added increased less than turnover (+6%), suggesting that the EU ETS, while driving up sales, also increased material and other variable costs.Increases in revenue were much larger in phase 2 and 3 compared to the first phase (Table E.1.), in line with the hypothesis of a gradual innovation and investment process.

        <p>ETS firms also increased their fixed assets by 8% compared to the counterfactual scenario of no EU ETS. The effect is significant at the 10% level only, but is slightly higher and significant at the 1% for the OLS specification. This difference is due to the fact that the larger increases occurred in smaller companies, which are given a lower weight in Poisson regressions compared to OLS (see Annexes E2 and F1). A natural explanation for this impact on fixed assets is that regulated companies reacted to the introduction of the EU ETS by adopting costly emissions-reduction technologies. As we have seen in Section 2, the price of carbon allowances on the European market has been unexpectedly low since 2005. While this could have reduced incentives to invest in emissions-reduction technologies, it is fundamentally expectations over future carbon prices which drive technology adoption. Since the overall cap of emissions under the EU ETS is known until 2030, and is planned to decrease every year, companies subject to the regulation should anticipate the future tightening of the cap and the implied increase in future carbon prices by investing today in carbon-saving technologies. In fact, it has been demonstrated elsewhere that EU ETS-regulated firms reacted to the introduction of the policy by filing 30% more patents in lowcarbon technologies compared to a counterfactual scenario (Calel and Dechezleprêtre, 2016).ETS firms also increased their fixed assets by 8% compared to the counterfactual scenario of no EU ETS.

        <p>Table 9 shows results per sector. The first notable result is that no sector has experienced a significant negative impact from the EU ETS. The Chemicals and Refinery sector shows negative competitiveness effects, but these are not significant. The largest positive effect of the EU ETS on revenue is driven by four sectors: minerals, metals, electricity and steam&amp;gas, with a particularly high impact in Metals. Overall, the electricity production seems to have most benefited from the EU ETS, with statistically significant increases in revenue, employment and profit. 34 Although not significant, the 2% increase in return on assets is larger than for the other sectors. The increase in profitability is in line with windfall profits stemming from the combination of cost pass-through and free allocations (see Annex E).Table 9 shows results per sector.

Our interpretations for the positive effect on revenue are compatible with larger effects in phases 2 and 3: innovation takes time to bring new products to the market and increase market share; the cost pass-through of carbon opportunity costs may be a gradual process in oligopolistic markets; and finally, allocating free allowances in the third phase based on past production volumes creates an incentive to increase production (Böhringer and Lange, 2005).Annex E also shows separate results for phases 1, 2 and 3 and Annex G shows the treatment effect by year.

        <p>We investigate the causal impact of the EU ETS on carbon emissions using installation-level data from the national PRTRs of France, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Applying a matched difference-in-differences study design, we find that the EU ETS is associated with a statistically significant reduction of carbon emissions of around 10%. In line with findings of previous studies, most of the reduction is found in the second trading phase from 2008 to 2012, and is primarily driven by large installations. Among the economic sectors analysed, the chemical sector shows the largest reductions. Our results also suggest that larger amounts of free allowances are associated with a lower treatment effect. Although our results are robust to various sensitivity checks, it should be noted that measuring the causal effects on emissions is much harder than measuring effects on economic outcomes. The starting sample is limited as very few countries report emission data for non-ETS installations. Moreover, it is difficult to find good comparators in several sectors and for large emitters. As a result, our results are based on a relatively small sample of 240 ETS installations and 280 non ETS installations.We investigate the causal impact of the EU ETS on carbon emissions using installation-level data from the national PRTRs of France, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

        <p>We then turn to investigating the impact of the EU ETS on the economic performance of regulated businesses. To do so, we rely on company data and a matched difference-in-differences study design. We compare close to 2000 ETS firms over time with unregulated firms within the same country and sector and with comparable turnover, fixed assets, employment and profit in the 3-year period preceding the introduction of the EU ETS. The EU ETS and non-EU ETS groups of firms experience parallel trends in all of these outcome variables prior to the introduction of the EU ETS, suggesting that the control group offers a valuable counterfactual against which to analyse the causal effect of the EU ETS. We find that the EU ETS led to a statistically significant increase in revenues of regulated firms, as well as to an increase in fixed assets.

        <p>Further research is needed to explore the drivers of these findings. At present, we can only observe that they are in line with widely available evidence of cost pass-through of carbon prices in various EU ETS sectors despite generous free allocations, and with previous evidence that the EU ETS induced regulated companies to increase R&amp;D activity in carbon-saving technologies. They are also compatible with the Porter hypothesis, but further analyses will shed light on these issues. We can, however, conclude with a high degree of confidence that the EU ETS seems to have led to some carbon emissions reductions with no negative impacts on the economic performance of regulated firms and thus on the competitiveness of the European industry.

At present, we can only observe that they are in line with widely available evidence of cost pass-through of carbon prices in various EU ETS sectors despite generous free allocations, and with previous evidence that the EU ETS induced regulated companies to increase R&amp;D activity in carbon-saving technologies. They are also compatible with the Porter hypothesis, but further analyses will shed light on these issues.

        <p>Table B.3. reports the EU ETS impact on emissions by sector. All sectors except manufacturing of food and beverages display a negative treatment effect between -1% and -18%. Because of the small sample size for individual sectors, the coefficient is not statistically significant except for the chemicals sector. Our preferred specification (shown in column 2) suggests that the effect of the EU ETS may have been stronger in the chemicals, non-metallic mineral products and other manufacturing sectors, but the estimated coefficients lack the required precision to state that these effects are statistically greater than in other sectors.

        <p>We ran various robustness checks regarding the effect of the EU ETS on emissions. The main results are reported in Table C.1.

        <p>A first concern is that the results might be driven by a small number of installations which have a large impact on the size of the point estimates. This is particularly relevant in our case because we are matching with replacement, meaning that the weight of an unregulated installation may be high when it serves as match for several regulated installations. We address this concern by removing installations with the 1% largest impact on the point estimate in each direction. 35 The treatment effect increases to -0.13**. A second concern is that our estimates are influenced by installations that have switched from combusting fossil fuels to using biofuels. To address this, we take the reported total CO 2 emissions without subtracting the emissions stemming from biofuels, and find the treatment effect to slightly increase to -0.12*. This shows that the results are not driven purely by a switch toward biomass. We also restrict the estimation to a balanced panel. The point estimate barely changes, although it is not statistically significant anymore because the number of installations is almost halved. Finally, we remove ETS or non-ETS installations that belong to the same mother company. This reduces the sample size to 502 installations.

        <p>In some cases regulated installations do not report emissions to the PRTR but do report emissions to the EUTL. In the baseline results, we conservatively only use PRTR emissions, but as a robustness check we exploit this additional information by substituting the emission value from the EUTL whenever it is missing in the PRTR. The estimated emissions reduction increases from 11% to 16%. The reason for the increase is that most of the newly introduced emission values are below the reporting threshold and come from installations that managed to reduce their emissions post-ETS to levels below the PRTR reporting threshold. Substituting these values from the EUTL adds many small values for the treatment group and strengthens the treatment effect. In another robustness check, we substitute the values from the EUTL if and only if the matched control installation has a non-missing emission value in that year. 36 The point estimate increases to 12% for the same reason as above. The PRTR data also enables us to infer some information regarding nonreported emissions value. CO 2 emissions reports might be missing because the installation might have forgotten to submit the CO 2 emissions, because the emissions value is below the reporting threshold or because the installation does not operate anymore. We can exploit PRTR information to detect the last case by looking at all other reported substances of each installation. If an installation stopped to report any substance to the PRTR, then it is likely to have exited the market, in which case we assign an emissions value of zero.

        <p>Even if our estimate of the impact of the EU ETS on carbon emissions reductions appears fairly robust within our matched sample, a more serious challenge to our conclusion is the small number of observations which might prevent us from extrapolating from this set of installations to all EU ETS installations in the four countries (and, beyond, to all EU ETS installations across Europe). In order to address this issue, we start by relaxing our matching procedure and match exactly on the 2-digit instead of on the 3-digit NACE code. Although one would naturally want to match firms using the finest possible sector definition, we face a difficult trade-off. First, some sectors were almost fully regulated by the EU ETS, as explained in Section 2. Therefore, matching at the NACE 3-digit sector, although appealing because we can in theory better control for sector-specific trends, leaves us with fewer matches than matching at a higher level. Matching at NACE 2-digit level therefore allows to substantially increase our sample size, but at a potential cost in terms of accuracy. Secondly, matching firms using the finest possible sector definition makes it theoretically possible that we match close competitors with each other. Imagine for example that there are two plants in a country that both produce the exact same output (e.g., the same type of cement). Once the EU ETS regulation is passed, cement produced by the EU ETS plant should become more expensive, inducing customers to favour cement from the non-ETS plant. This implies that the policy has also indirectly affected the non-ETS plant. Matching at a higher level reduces the likelihood that two close competitors are matched with each other, but at the cost that the two installations might not face the same demand conditions and thus follow parallel trends.Even if our estimate of the impact of the EU ETS on carbon emissions reductions appears fairly robust within our matched sample, a more serious challenge to our conclusion is the small number of observations which might prevent us from extrapolating from this set of installations to all EU ETS installations in the four countries (and, beyond, to all EU ETS installations across Europe).

        <p>Matching at NACE 2-digit level increases the matched sample by more than 150 installations while potentially reducing the matching quality (because installations can now be matched to installations operating in different sub-sectors) but reducing the probability of matching competitors together. For example, within the non-metallic minerals sector an installation manufacturing glass can now be matched to an installation that produces cement. Applying this matching procedure reduces the point estimate to -0.07*.Matching at NACE 2-digit level increases the matched sample by more than 150 installations while potentially reducing the matching quality (because installations can now be matched to installations operating in different sub-sectors) but reducing the probability of matching competitors together.

        <p>We also check for a less robust matching procedure by allowing matches between installations that have a higher distance in terms of emissions and emissions growth rate, but which are matched exactly on NACE 3-digit and country. Doing this increases the sample size to 855 installations, but comes at the cost that regulated and unregulated installations are not so similar anymore. The treatment effect of this DiD estimator remains at -0.07, but fails to be statistically significant due to the larger heterogeneity of the matched sample. In addition, this procedure fails to produce parallel trends pre-ETS.We also check for a less robust matching procedure by allowing matches between installations that have a higher distance in terms of emissions and emissions growth rate, but which are matched exactly on NACE 3-digit and country.

        <p>In heterogeneity analysis, we systematically report results for OLS and Poisson regressions. Loosely speaking, the Poisson regression coefficients can be interpreted as the aggregate, overall % increase for the ETS firms in our sample. Larger companies will have a larger effect on the overall increase. By contrast, the OLS results report the mean % increase, i.e. a 1% increase of a small firm has a similar contribution to our estimate as a 1% increase of a large firm 37 (see annex F1).In heterogeneity analysis, we systematically report results for OLS and Poisson regressions.

        <p>We start by exploring the impact of the EU ETS across its three phases (2005-2007; 2008-2012; 2013-2014). Results are shown in Table E.1. We find that, the impact of the EU ETS on revenue and assets is much larger in Phases 2 and 3 than in Phase 1. This might be surprising, given that the allocation of free allowances was more generous in Phase 1 than in Phases 2 and 3. However, it is important to keep in mind that the "operational revenues" variable we use does not include potential financial revenues from selling allowances on the market. It could, however, be at least partly influenced by cost pass-through of carbon prices on product prices. Effects on employees depend on the type of regression, as in the main specification, but again they are larger during phase 2 and 3. In phase 2, where our test has the largest power, both specification indicate an increase in employment. We do not find significant results on profits, returns nor on assets.

We find that the impact on revenue in statistically significant and of similar magnitude for the three types of firms. The impact of the ETS on assets are large for small and medium enterprises, and small (5%-8%) and non-significant for large companies. Regarding employment, the Poisson regressions show that the aggregate effect on employment is larger in small companies.

        <p>We find some differences in the impact of the EU ETS across European regions. The general picture is the following: the increase in competitiveness effects from the EU ETS is larger in Eastern Europe. This is in line with larger free allocation in this region. But even in Southern, Northern and Western Europe, most ETS effects are positive. The effect on revenue appears similar in the different regions. The increase in investment in fixed assets is particularly pronounced in Eastern Europe and in the North, but much smaller and not statistically significant in the West and the South. The EU ETS may have led firms in Southern and Eastern regions to increase employment (depending on Poisson or OLS). Finally, the ETS decreased the likelihood of firm closure in the North by 10%. 38 The overall pattern suggests that no region was particularly hit by the regulation.We find some differences in the impact of the EU ETS across European regions.

        <p>In order to dig deeper into the geographical heterogeneity of the impact of the EU ETS, we also report results by country. The small number of observations in some small countries prevents us from accurately measuring the impact in all countries of the sample. Therefore, we limit the results to those countries where the total number of firms (EU ETS and control firms) is greater than 50. These countries include Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Results are reported in Table E.4. We caution against overinterpreting these results because of the risks associated with multiple testing (the more statistical tests are made, the more likely is it that some erroneous inferences occur, i.e. false positives). The main result that comes out of this analysis is that no country experiences a statistically significant negative impact on revenue, fixed assets, employment or profits. However, we observe the presence of heterogeneity in the impact of the EU ETS across countries, but this heterogeneity differs across outcomes. The revenue effect appears quite stable across countries, while the reaction in terms of investment differs markedly, from a non-significant negative effect in Belgium to over 50% increase in Romania (although the latter coefficient is not very precisely estimated). Poland, Romania and Sweden stand out, with positive and statistically significant impacts on both revenue and fixed assets.

In Poland and Great-Britain, the ETS decreases the likelihood of firm closure.</p>

        <p>Over 99,8% of emission allowances were allocated for free during the first phase and 97% during the second phase (Schleich et al., 2009). In the meantime the carbon cost is passed through to output prices in particular in the electricity sector which faces little international competition (Fabra and Reguant, 2014; Sijm et al., 2008; Fell et al., 2015; Hintermann, 2016). Since electricity prices are determined by marginal costs of the marginal production technology, often coal or gas, the opportunity costs created by free allowances were also included in electricity prices and led to an increase in firms' profits, a phenomenon that has been labeled "windfall profits" (Wietze et al., 2010; Sijm et al., 2006). Windfall profits are likely to be smaller in other sectors where international competition leads to lower cost pass through.Over 99,8% of emission allowances were allocated for free during the first phase and 97% during the second phase (Schleich et al., 2009).

        <p>An important concern of policy makers is the impact that the EU ETS could have on competitiveness, resulting in job losses. In order to protect industry from potential relocation risks, a list of sectors deemed at risk of carbon leakage was designed by the European Commission, and companies operating in these sectors qualify for free allowances while others progressively have to resort to auctioning. Here we explore both the effects of the ETS and being part of the sectors "at risk". To do so we create interaction variables between the EU ETS dummy variable, the post-treatment dummy variable and an additional dummy variable equal to one if the company belongs to one of the sectors considered "at risk". Results are shown in Table E.5. The reference category is composed of non-ETS firms, in sectors not deemed at risk. 39 The variable post*AtRisk correspond to the difference between sectors at risk and not at risk for non-ETS firms after 2005. Results show that non-ETS companies operating in sectors at risk of carbon leakage indeed experienced difficulties compared to firms not judged at risk: after 2005, their revenue, assets and employment decreased by 10%-20% and the risk of closure increased. This suggests that sectors considered at risk by the European Commission indeed operate in fiercely competitive markets and faced more difficult economic times after 2005. The coefficients on the third line, relating to the variable ETS*post show the effect of the ETS within the sectors not deemed at risk. It shows that the ETS had a smaller effect in the sectors not deemed at risk (revenues +10%, assets +5% but not significant). The first line shows the interaction effect of both being regulated by the ETS and being in a sector deemed at risk. 40 Interestingly, within sectors at risk, companies regulated under the EU ETS performed relatively better than their non-ETS counterparts, as shown by the positive coefficients on the first results line of Table E.5. This indicates that the distribution of free allowances may have more than compensated EU ETS firms at risk for the induced carbon abatement costs of the regulation.An important concern of policy makers is the impact that the EU ETS could have on competitiveness, resulting in job losses.

Firstly, it is less sensitive to bias in the presence of heteroscedasticity (Silva and Tenreyro, 2006). Next, it allows us to include values of zero and is less sensitive to small observations (in OLS, a company evolving from 1 to 10 employees has an increase of 900% and is an outlier). Third, from an economic perspective, the aggregate % increase is more important than the average % increase of each separate company. For example, if a large company increases employment by 1% and a small company decreases employment by 1%, the aggregate employment (as reported by Poisson) would increase, while the mean relative change (as reported by OLS) would be zero.the ETS firms, in which small and large companies have the same weight. 42 The Poisson regression has several advantages over OLS.

        <p>In the baseline results, we control for country-and sector-specific year-fixed-effects. That means that for each sector and each country, we have 14 year-fixed-effects. For example, revenue, assets and profits are expressed in nominal values. These effects can capture country-and sector-specific inflation which could partly affect the magnitude of our point estimates. The matching procedure is designed to control for country-and sector-specific trends, since each control firm is selected from the pool of firms operating in the exact same country and sector as the treated firm. However, the final distribution of matched firms across countries and sectors could affect our point estimates if macroeconomic trends differ across countries and sectors.In the baseline results, we control for country-and sector-specific year-fixed-effects.

        <p>The disadvantage of the fixed effects is that they also filter out most of the variation. Therefore we show two approaches where we limit the number of fixed effect. In Table F.2, we replace the 14 year-specific effects for each sector and each country by a single linear trend. In Table F.3., we use only 14 year-fixed effects, which are common to all countries and sectors. Note that our baseline results on closure have already a limited number of fixed effects. This is because whenever a dummy variable designates a group of observations without closure, this group of observations is omitted because the variable would predict non-closure perfectly (the effect on the zscore would be minus infinity). 42 In fact, in order to avoid excessive influence of very small companies, we weight the OLS regressions by the log As shown in Table F.2., omitting these additional control variables actually leads to slightly lower point estimates. We find that the EU ETS led firms to increase revenues by 13%-17%, assets by 7%-8% and employment by 3-8%. Table F.3. shows that leaving out sector and country trends altogether, gives again similar results, sometimes 1% lower. By showing similar results with fewer fixed effects, we rule out that our results are only valid after filtering out a large proportion of the variability in the data.The disadvantage of the fixed effects is that they also filter out most of the variation.

        <p>Imagine that in a given country there would be a sector-specific policy, input price shock or demand shock, affecting the outcomes of both ETS and non-ETS firms equally. In such a case we would need a country-sector-specific time-fixed-effect to avoid bias (especially if this country's sector was overrepresented in our sample, for example, there would be many good non-ETS matches by chance). Table F.4. reports results for country-sector specific time fixed effects. Results are very similar, approximately 1 percentage point higher than in the baseline on revenue, assets and employees. The results on the three main variables of interest are now all statistically significant, including the effect on employees for the Poisson regression.Imagine that in a given country there would be a sector-specific policy, input price shock or demand shock, affecting the outcomes of both ETS and non-ETS firms equally.

        <p>The baseline results have been obtained by using all possible observations, irrespective of whether some of the data might be missing for some years (for example, a firm might have missing data for the number of employees in a specific year). However, our data suggests that the number of missing values is on average twice as high for non-EU ETS than for EU ETS firms. This could signal that EU ETS firms have better institutional capacity or that they differ from non-EU ETS firms in some unobserved but systematic way. To deal with this issue, we run two tests: first, we apply a procedure to replace any observed value with a missing if that value is missing for the matched firm within each pair. For example, if an EU ETS firm has non-missing employee data in 2010 but its control has missing employee data in that year, we replace the 2010 value for EU ETS firms with a missing. Secondly, we restrict the set of firms to those that are observed throughout the whole sample period for all our variables of interest. This should remove any remaining systematic difference between the treated and the control group.The baseline results have been obtained by using all possible observations, irrespective of whether some of the data might be missing for some years (for example, a firm might have missing data for the number of employees in a specific year).

        <p>Results are presented in Table F.5. and Table F.6. Implementing the "pairwise missing replacement" procedure reduces the number of observations by about 10% but leaves the results more or less unchanged. Poisson effects on assets and employees become smaller and non-significant, whereas the OLS estimates remain significant. Restricting the set of firms to those that are observed throughout the whole sample period for all our variables of interest further reduces the sample to around 65% of firms in the baseline sample. Again, the results are very similar in magnitude. The Poisson estimates on assets and employees are larger than in the "pairwise missing replacement" approach (the effect on assets is even larger than in the baseline), but non-significant.Results are presented in Table F.5. and Table F.6.

        <p>The baseline results have been obtained by matching exactly on the EU ETS firms' core sector of activity as reported in Orbis at the NACE 3-digit level. Although one would ideally match firms using the finest possible sector definition, we face a trade-off here as some sectors were almost fully regulated by the EU ETS, as explained in Section 2. Therefore, matching at the NACE 4-digit sector, although appealing because we can then better control for sector-specific trends, leaves us with fewer matches than matching at a higher level. Symmetrically, matching at NACE 2-digit level allows to substantially increase our sample size, but at a potential cost in terms of accuracy.The baseline results have been obtained by matching exactly on the EU ETS firms' core sector of activity as reported in Orbis at the NACE 3-digit level.

        <p>Therefore, we ran the same analysis as above but matching companies at the NACE 4-digit level or the NACE 2-digit level. Matching at NACE 2-digit leaves us with 4448 unique firms (up from 3766) while matching at NACE 4-digit reduces this to 2984 unique firms. Matching at NACE 4-digit leaves the results virtually unchanged. However, matching at NACE 2-digit reduces the impact on revenue at +10% and the OLS estimate on employment is lower at 3%, and statistically non-significant. At any rate, these robustness checks provide reasonable bounds for the treatment effect.Therefore, we ran the same analysis as above but matching companies at the NACE 4-digit level or the NACE 2-digit level.

        <p>Since we apply matching with replacement, in some non-ETS firms that are very similar to ETS firms can serve as a match many time. This reduces bias, because firms are similar, but the repeated non-ETS firms may have a large effect on the results. 78% of non-ETS firms serve only once as a match, but 5% (155 firms) serve more than 3 times. Therefore, below we show results where we omit pairs for which the control firm serves more than 3 times (we randomly keep the first 3 occurrences in the database). Results are shown in Table F.9. and are very similar to our baseline results.Since we apply matching with replacement, in some non-ETS firms that are very similar to ETS firms can serve as a match many time.

        <p>For example, consider the results on profits (EBIT). Profits (EBIT) are expressed in thousands of euros and not in %, because they can be both negative and positive. On average, both ETS firms and non-ETS firms have increased profits after the start of the ETS, but the same relative increase in profits, will lead to a larger absolute increase in the larger firms, which are more often in the EU ETS. The positive effect in our regression is therefore likely to be driven by mere size.For example, consider the results on profits (EBIT).

        <p>Regarding employment, the results show a decreasing effect on employment in the Poisson regression (no effect in the OLS regression). Although employment is considered in relative terms, employment trends can still be different for small and large companies. Both ETS firms and non-ETS firms have reduced employment over the period. But since employment trends can be affected by both size and the ETS, it is unclear if this larger reduction in ETS firms is due to their size or to the ETS.

        <p>All specifications yield a statistically significant treatment effect of -0.10 to -0.11, meaning that the EU ETS is associated with a reduction of emissions of roughly 10%. This corresponds to roughly 5 kt for the average installation. Reassuringly, estimating a standard linear regression model with installation and year fixed effects also yields a point estimate of around -5kt, though the coefficient is not significant at conventional levels (see Annex B, TableB.1).Estimating the treatment effect for each year, Fig.8suggests that most of the emissions reduction was realised in the second trading phase of the EU ETS. While the treatment effect is systematically negative from 2006, it is highest and statistically significant in the last two years of the second trading phase. Breaking down the estimate by phase, we observe a statistically insignificant emissions reduction of 6% for the first phase and a statistically significant reduction of 15% in the second phase. This is in line with the findings of 22 See Annex IV of Directive (2003)/87/EC.23 We tried different specifications of equation (1), including equation (1) as such, as well as adding sector-year or country-year trends and sectoryear or country-year fixed effects with different sectoral granularities (e.g. two digit or three digit NACE codes).24 In the matched sample of the emissions dataset, there are 17 installations that are used more than 3 times as a control (non-ETS) or a treated (ETS) installation. In the 3 most extreme cases, one non-ETS installation was matched to 21, 12, and 9 ETS installations respectively. Restricting the number of replacements to 10, 5 or 3 does not alter the results qualitatively (see Annex C).25 Note that Norwegian installations became regulated by the EU ETS from 2008 onwards. However, these installations only constitute a very small part of our matched sample.All specifications yield a statistically significant treatment effect of -0.10 to -0.11, meaning that the EU ETS is associated with a reduction of emissions of roughly 10%.

        <p>Technically, we estimate our specification several times, each time excluding one installation from the matched sample. The impact of each installation on the treatment effect is then the difference between the point estimate of the full sample and the point estimate of the restricted sample that excludes this installation.Technically, we estimate our specification several times, each time excluding one installation from the matched sample.
