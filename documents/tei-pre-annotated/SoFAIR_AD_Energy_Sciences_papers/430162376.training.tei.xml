        <p>We report an active Zinc-Copper (Zn-Cu) bimetallic electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO, prepared by a facile galvanic-procedure. Under moderate overpotentials, Zn-Cu alloys that are Zn-rich exhibit intrinsic activity for CO formation superior to that of pure Zn, Cu, and Ag, the latter of which is the state-of-the-art catalyst in CO2 electrolyzers. Combinatorial experiments involving catalysts prepared by physical vapor deposition reveal trends across the Zn-Cu alloy system, corroborating the high CO selectivity unrivaled by other alloys and intermetallics. A combination of physical and electrochemical characterization and first principles theory reveals that the origin of this synergy in intrinsic activity is an electronic effect from bimetallic Zn-Cu sites that stabilizes the carboxyl intermediate during CO2 reduction to CO. Furthermore, by integrating Zn-Cu into gas-diffusion-electrodes we demonstrate that the bimetallic effects lead to improved electrocatalytic performance at industrially relevant currents. These insights provide catalyst design principles that can guide future development of efficient and earth abundant COproducing electrocatalysts.We report an active Zinc-Copper (Zn-Cu) bimetallic electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CO, prepared by a facile galvanic-procedure.

        <p>Syngas, a fuel gas mixture consisting primarily of CO and H2, is one of the most important resources in the chemical industry as a precursor for many products including high energy density fuels, e.g. methanol, ammonia and synthetic petroleum. 1 Active research on converting syngas to higher alcohols through either thermal or biocatalytic processes are expected to further boost the syngas industry. 2,3 As the majority of syngas is currently produced from fossil fuels, 4 it would be of great value to establish sustainable pathways to CO and H2. One such route for generating CO is electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R), where CO2, H2O, and renewable electricity can be used to upgrade CO2 into CO. This is a promising strategy to mitigate CO2 emissions by developing a carbon industry based on CO2 that stores variable electricity from renewable sources in chemical form. [5][6][7] Establishing catalyst design principles for maximizing selectivity and activity towards desired products is crucial for the industrialization of electrochemical CO2R. Many successful strategies that have been reported for developing high-performance CO-production catalysts including nanostructuring state-of-the-art Au and Ag catalysts, [8][9][10][11][12][13] combining metals into multimetallic electrocatalysts, [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24] incorporating first row transition metals into heteroatom-doped graphitic carbons, [25][26][27][28][29][30][31] and immobilizing molecular catalysts onto electrode surfaces. [32][33][34][35] As shown in Fig. 1, precious metal Au-and Ag-based materials remain as the most active electrocatalysts for CO2R to CO, motivating the development of new catalysts comprised of earth abundant metals. In addition to their high intrinsic activity and selectivity for CO production, nano-structuring Au and Ag materials has been shown as a promising strategy to further improve their geometric activities by leveraging a combination of surface area effects, 36 local pH 11 and field effects. 9 However, normalizing the geometric activities of nanostructured Au and Ag electrodes to their corresponding electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA), similar or even lower activities are obtained in comparison to those of planar Au and Ag foils, suggesting that increasing their electrode surface areas does not improve intrinsic activities. Transition metals and nitrogen doped carbons (M-N-C) have also been extensively studied as CO producing catalysts. [51][52][53][54][55][56] An important area of study is identifying and quantifying the active sites due to substantial heterogeneity of these materials with many distinct, isolated motifs. Efforts to understand these factors are critical to overcome the generally low density of active sites of M-N-C type materials and to make them competitive to the precious metal catalysts on an electrode area basis. Molecular catalysts are known to have high turnover frequency (TOF) per site for reducing CO2 to CO, e.g. a TOF ~ 10 4 has been observed for a Fe-porphyrin catalyst at overpotential of 0.56 V. 37 After immobilized to conductive substrate, molecular catalysts behave similarly to the M-N-Cs, which is expected due to the similarity of their active motifs. [33][34][35] Understanding how the intrinsic activity of the molecular catalyst is affected by heterogenization to the solid-electrolyte interface remains a significant research challenge. 38 Figure 1.

        <p>By mixing metals at the atomic level, e.g. through alloying, solid solutions, intermetallic and segregated phases, the electronic properties of the resulting metallic surfaces can be modified and tuned to facilitate CO formation. Thus, bimetallic materials based on non-precious metals are promising for replacing the state-of-art Au-and/or Ag-based catalysts. In fact, several studies have demonstrated synergistic bimetallic effects for CO formation, showing enhanced activity with respect to the sum of their monometallic catalysts. 14,24 However, clear demonstrations of improving the intrinsic activity for CO2R to CO through bimetallic effects among non-precious metal catalysts are rare. Thus, further probing and understanding mechanisms among bimetallic catalysts are needed to establish structure-performance relations, which can ultimately lead to improved intrinsic activity that is comparable or higher than that of precious Au-and/or Ag-based catalysts. As Zn is the only non-precious material in the group of CO-producing monometals it is a promising candidate for bimetallic studies. 39 However, Zn has a lower intrinsic activity and selectivity for CO2R to CO compared to Au and Ag (Fig. 1), [39][40][41] which is likely related to the weak CO binding energy on Zn surfaces. 40,42 As Cu has a moderate CO binding energy which is higher than that of Zn, incorporating Cu into Zn could, in principle, increase the CO binding energy of the bimetallic surface, and potentially upgrade its CO2R performance. 40 Previous efforts have shown that bimetallic alloys of ZnxCu1-x (Zn-Cu) that are Zn-rich are selective towards syngas (CO and H2), 22 while those that are Cu-rich favor &gt; 2e -products. [43][44][45][46] These promising results motivate further studies to understand whether alloying Zn and Cu enhances the bimetallic's intrinsic activity for CO2R to CO, and the specific atomic-scale interactions between Zn and Cu (e.g., ligand and strain effects) that engender improved catalytic performance.By mixing metals at the atomic level, e.g. through alloying, solid solutions, intermetallic and segregated phases, the electronic properties of the resulting metallic surfaces can be modified and tuned to facilitate CO formation.

        <p>In this work we prepare Zn-Cu catalysts in a different manner, exploiting a galvanic exchange procedure to synthesize a planar Zn-Cu bimetallic catalyst with relatively high surface Zn to Cu ratio that is highly selective for CO2R to CO. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that incorporating Cu engenders an electronic effect that transfers outer shell electron density from Zn to Cu. We hypothesize that this electronic effect is responsible for the observed synergistic catalytic activity of Zn-Cu for CO2R to CO, which is greater than that of pure Cu or Zn. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the bimetallic promotes the overall reaction rate towards CO formation by stabilizing the carboxyl (COOH*) intermediate. We used the same galvanic exchange procedure to implement powder-based Zn-Cu onto a gas diffusion electrode (GDE), and demonstrate that the catalyst is active and selective for CO2R to CO at industrially relevant current densities in a vapor-fed device. The design principles and insights resulting from this work can guide the future development of earth abundant catalysts for CO2 electrolyzers.In this work we prepare Zn-Cu catalysts in a different manner, exploiting a galvanic exchange procedure to synthesize a planar Zn-Cu bimetallic catalyst with relatively high surface Zn to Cu ratio that is highly selective for CO2R to CO.

        <p>Synthesis and characterization of Zn-Cu bimetallic electrocatalysts. The Zn-Cu electrodes were prepared by immersing pre-polished polycrystalline Zn foils into a dilute CuSO4 solution at room temperature for a short period of time (referred to Zn-Cu (ns) electrodes, ns denotes time as 1, 5, 30, and 60 seconds). There is an obvious visual change upon deposition as the sample changes from silver to black in color. A representative scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the Zn foil before and after 5 seconds of the galvanic exchange is shown in Fig. 2a and2b, respectively. Notably, a layer of nanoparticles (50-100 nm in size) is seen to form on the surface of Zn foil from this rapid treatment (Fig. 2b), indicating that the galvanic exchange procedure rapidly roughens the surface of Zn during the process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis suggests that the surfaces of these nanoparticles are enriched in Zn with a Zn:Cu ratio of ~10:1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). A comparison of SEM and XPS data for 1, 5, 30, and 60 seconds Zn-Cu electrodes indicates that Cu composition and nanoparticle size increase concomitantly with the reaction time (Supplementary Fig. 2). We propose that the surface roughening results from rapid Zn crystal deformation, starting from the grain boundaries and defects, likely due in part to the large thermodynamic driving force of the galvanic reaction ( 𝐸 𝐶𝑢 2+ /𝑍𝑛 0 =1.1 V). 47,48 Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed (Supplementary Fig. 3) to assess the crystallinity of the prepared samples. No new XRD patterns emerged nor were expected for Zn-Cu bimetallic formation, due to a combination of the rough electrode-surface which will introduce significant amount of bulk-Zn signals even for grazing incidence configuration, and the similarity of the XRD patterns for Zn and Zn-Cu alloys that are Zn-rich. 44 The absence of a pure Cu-metal phase, however, indicates a bimetallic surface without major phase separation. Atomic force microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 4) was introduced to directly measure the surface area differences between the Zn-Cu electrodes and the planar Zn foil-based electrode. In addition, double layer capacitance measurements (Supplementary Fig. 5) were also introduced to measure the increase in double layer capacitance of Zn-Cu compared to that of Zn foil, since it should scale with the electrochemical active surface area. Increase of 1.35 and 2.5 times in surface area were obtained for Zn-Cu electrode by the above two different measurements, respectively. Thus, while the galvanic exchange procedure nanostructures the surface, we conclude that it leads to relatively minor changes in the porosity of the electrodes.Synthesis and characterization of Zn-Cu bimetallic electrocatalysts.

        <p>The Zn-Cu (5s) electrode was probed with XPS to investigate its surface composition and electronic structure. The presence of XPS peaks at binding energies of 1022.5 (Zn 2p3/2) and 1045.5 eV (Zn 2p1/2) indicates that ZnO is present in the as prepared sample. As Zn metal is readily oxidized by air to form a native oxide layer (ΔfG˚ZnO = 320.5 kJ mol -1 ), 49 we suggest that ZnO forms from oxygen exposure prior to the ex situ XPS measurement. This oxidation process is more rapid when the surface consists of nanoparticles, 50 which are present on the Zn-Cu samples in our work. Based on Pourbaix analysis of Zn, 49 we suggest that the native oxide is reduced to Zn metal under CO2R conditions. This hypothesis is in agreement with recent ex situ and operando characterization studies 51,52 that indicate metallic Zn is the active phase for electrochemical CO2R. On the other hand, Cu is likely in its metallic state in a Zn-Cu alloy (vide infra), as only a Cu 2p3/2 peak was observed at a downshifted binding energy of 932.0 eV with a notable absence of satellite peaks for both CuO and Cu2O, and about ~1 eV lower than that of pure Cu metal. 53 This suggests a strong ligand effect from neighboring Zn atoms, further below we describe our efforts involving X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to further probe electronic structure. XPS depth profiling using argon sputtering shows that both the Zn/Cu ratio and the Zn 2p3/2 peak position are dependent on the sputter time (Fig. 2c,d, Supplementary Fig. 6). We hypothesize that the trend of Zn surface segregation arises because Zn is more oxophilic than Cu, which is commensurate with the aforementioned conclusion that ZnO is present on the surface. Conversely, the Cu 2p3/2 peak position is consistent at ~932.0 eV, suggesting that the electronic structure of Cu is similar throughout the probe depth.The Zn-Cu (5s) electrode was probed with XPS to investigate its surface composition and electronic structure.

        <p>To further investigate these electronic interactions, we performed synchrotron XAS on the Zn and Cu K-edge within both their near-edge structure (XANES, Fig 2e,d) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) regions (Supplementary Fig. 7) for the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode. Zn K-edge XANES reveals no prominent pre-edge feature for Zn-Cu (5s) with a lower edge energy of 9658.7 eV compared to 9659 eV for the Zn foil reference, suggesting that Zn within the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode is mainly in a reduced state. Although XPS results indicate that ZnO is present on the surface of Zn-Cu (5s), ZnO features were not observed in the XANES data for Zn-Cu (5s); we attribute the lack of ZnO features in the XANES data to the large XAS probe depth (~ 1µm) relative to the thin ZnO layer (&lt;5-10 nm). Analysis of the Zn K-edge EXAFS region corroborates this conclusion, as there is a single scattering peak at 2.25 Å that is consistent with Zn-Zn metal bonding (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, the Cu K-edge XANES of Zn-Cu (5s) shows substantially different features relative to those of the Cu foil reference. In particular, the pre-edge peak at ~8981 eV that is prominent for the Cu foil is greatly suppressed for Zn-Cu (5s). Based on the calculated projected density of states (PDOSs) for Zn 4s and Cu 4s orbitals in Zn-Cu (5s) (Supplementary Fig. 8), we attribute this phenomenon to Zn donating 4s electron density to neighboring Cu atoms, which is in agreement with conclusions from previous studies on Zn-Cu alloys. 54 Similar to the XPS results, the Cu K-edge EXAFS data shows a single peak at 2.25 Å indicating that Cu is in a primarily metallic state (Supplementary Fig. 7). All the above evidence demonstrates that the galvanic exchange process generates a well-mixed bimetallic system instead of a Cu layer on top of the bulk Zn metal. Moreover, there are strong electronic interactions between Zn and Cu atoms in the Zn-Cu (5s) bimetallic, exhibiting distinct electronic properties in comparison to those of pure Zn and Cu. 3).To further investigate these electronic interactions, we performed synchrotron XAS on the Zn and Cu K-edge within both their near-edge structure (XANES, Fig 2e,d) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) regions (Supplementary Fig. 7) for the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode.

        <p>Electrocatalytic performance of Zn-Cu bimetallic electrodes. The electrocatalytic CO2R performance of the Zn-Cu electrodes were evaluated using 0.1 M KHCO3 as the electrolyte in a two-compartment electrochemical cell. We first investigated how the surface concentration of Cu in Zn-Cu affects the CO2R activity by using a combination of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) measurements to evaluate the 1, 5, 30, and 60 seconds Zn-Cu electrodes. The results indicate that the CO2R to CO activities do not scale linearly with the surface Cu concentration, and instead plateau after 5 seconds of the galvanic exchange treatment (Supplementary Fig. 9). Thus, for the remainder of this work we used the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode as a platform for a deeper investigation of CO2R activity and selectivity.Electrocatalytic performance of Zn-Cu bimetallic electrodes.

Thus, for the remainder of this work we used the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode as a platform for a deeper investigation of CO2R activity and selectivity.</p>
        <p>To determine whether incorporating Cu into Zn enhances the intrinsic catalytic activity, we compared the electrocatalytic performance of Zn-Cu (5s) to that of pure Zn and Cu. Initial CV measurements suggest that Zn-Cu (5s) electrode has a higher current density compare to pristine Zn and Cu electrodes under the same CO2R catalytic condition (Supplementary Fig. 10), motivating more detailed CA measurements with product quantifications to confirm the increase in current density is a result of enhancement in CO2R activity. As the galvanic exchange procedure induces nanostructuring of Zn-Cu (5s), we accounted for differences in the surface area of the electrodes by normalizing partial current densities to several metal foil-based electrodes (Zn, Ag, Au) and employing several different surface area measurements (Supplementary Fig. 4,Fig 5, Note 1). At the same electrode potential (-0.96 V vs. RHE) Zn-Cu (5s) is almost fully selective (97% FE) for the CO pathway, whereas Zn is only 30% selective (FE) (Fig. 3a). Formate and hydrogen are minor products evolved from Zn-Cu; no additional products were detected (Supplementary Table 3). The normalized data indicates that Zn-Cu (5s) is 7 times more active than pure Zn for CO2R to CO at an electrode potential of -0.96 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3b). The above results indicate that Zn-Cu (5s) is more selective than Zn for CO2R to CO by improving both the intrinsic catalytic activity for the CO2R to CO pathway and suppressing the competing HER. To compare the intrinsic catalytic activities of Zn-Cu (5s) and Cu, we analyzed the normalized total CO2 consumption rates to account for the fact that Cu is more selective for further reduced products beyond CO (Supplementary Fig. 11). This assessment clearly demonstrates that Zn-Cu (5s) has a faster CO2R rate than pure Cu and Zn regardless of which product is being formed from CO2, indicating that incorporating Cu into Zn engenders a synergistic effect that improves the intrinsic CO2R activity of Zn-Cu bimetallic beyond that of either of its component metals.To determine whether incorporating Cu into Zn enhances the intrinsic catalytic activity, we compared the electrocatalytic performance of Zn-Cu (5s) to that of pure Zn and Cu.

        <p>Since previous research has shown that nanostructuring CO2R electrocatalysts can also induce changes in selectivity through porosity effects, 55 we further investigated trends in reactivity using sputtered thin films of Zn-Cu with negligible surface roughness, since the thin-film based electrodes are reasonable approximation to the galvanic exchanged system due to their similar surface Zn:Cu ratio. A comparison of sputtered Zn10Cu1 and Zn films across a range of electrode potentials shows similar trends in activity and selectivity as those described above for the Zn-Cu (5s) and Zn foils (Supplementary Fig. 14). For example, the Zn10Cu1 film in comparison to the Zn film exhibits significantly improved intrinsic activity and selectivity for CO2R to CO and suppressed intrinsic activity and selectivity for the HER. These results corroborate our conclusion that the aforementioned synergy in intrinsic activity is likely due to a bimetallic effect rather than an electrode surface area effect. To better understand the impact of the electrode composition on reactivity, we also prepared and tested Zn1Cu10 thin films to reflect the other extreme of a high Cu:Zn ratio for the sake of comparison. While these Zn1Cu10 films show similar partial current densities for CO formation as those for Zn10Cu1 films, the Zn1Cu10 films are also more active and selective for the HER and for &gt; 2 e -CO2 reduction products, more similar to pure Cu. Thus, the results indicate that a Zn-rich surface is more favorable for applications that require high selectivity for CO2R to CO.Since previous research has shown that nanostructuring CO2R electrocatalysts can also induce changes in selectivity through porosity effects, 55 we further investigated trends in reactivity using sputtered thin films of Zn-Cu with negligible surface roughness, since the thin-film based electrodes are reasonable approximation to the galvanic exchanged system due to their similar surface Zn:Cu ratio.

        <p>To assess a broader range of Zn-Cu bimetallic compositions, the study of sputtered films was extended to a composition library in which 5 compositions spanning 4% to 70% Zn were synthesized. These films were examined for CO2R at -0.85 V vs RHE using a specialized high throughput electrochemical recirculation cell, enabling product distributions to be assessed after only 15 min. of electrolysis. The results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 15 and demonstrate that the intrinsic activity and product selectivity vary dramatically with film composition. For lower concentrations of Zn, the HER activity increases substantially with increasing Zn concentration up to approximately 50%, reaching a current density of 13.5 mA cm -2 corresponding to a Faradaic efficiency of over 83% for H2. Further increasing in Zn concentration from 50% to 70% results in more than 10-fold decrease in H2 partial current density and more than 10-fold increase in CO partial current density. These trends continue with increasing Zn concentration to the Zn10Cu1 catalyst noted above, which exhibits catalyst selectivity beyond that observed in any of the other alloy compositions. This maximum in CO selectivity coincides with the formation of an hcp alloy in the sputter deposited films, as was observed with the galvanic exchange catalysts discussed above. The collective results involving Zn-Cu catalysts, prepared in various ways across a range of compositions and investigated in multiple laboratories, robustly demonstrate the unique catalytic properties of Cu alloyed in hcp Zn. This motivates theoretical investigations of the selectivity-enhancing mechanisms involved. Theoretical insights on the impact of bimetallic effects on surface reactivity. The above experimental (Fig. 2) and computational (Supplementary Fig. 6) results on Zn-Cu alloys suggest that the observed synergy in activity is related to an electronic effect between Zn and neighboring Cu atoms that affects the adsorption of key reaction intermediates. To further gain insight into this enhancement in performance, we carried out theoretical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT). Since undercoordinated sites have been identified as the major active sites for CO2R to CO, 56 we therefore evaluated reaction energetics for both CO2R and the competing reaction HER, on stepped surfaces of Zn-Cu alloys with different surface compositions (see details in the Computational Details and Supplementary Fig. 16). The CO2R mechanism is considered to proceed through the sequential two-step reduction of an adsorbed CO2 to COOH* and then to CO* and water, followed by the desorption of CO (Fig. 4a), while a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is considered for HER (Fig. 4b). Fig. 4a shows that the potential determining step (PDS) is the first protonation step to form COOH*. The Zn11Cu1 surface possesses a stronger COOH* adsorption energy (∆G ads COOH* ) by 0.15 eV compared to that of the pristine Zn (0.44 eV), which can explain the earlier onset potential for CO production on the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode. At sufficiently negative potentials (e.g., -0.96 V vs. RHE), both CO formation and HER become thermodynamically favorable (Supplementary Fig. 17). The suppression of the HER in Zn-Cu (5s) is also explained by the computational modeling. On one hand, surface H* is stabilized by incorporating Cu into Zn which should in principle improve HER activity, however, this is not the case for two reasons. First, this effect is not as profound as that for COOH*, indicating a smaller effect on the HER than for the CO2R (Fig. 4b). Secondly, CO-poisoning can have a substantial impact on H-binding and on the resulting HER activity. 57 At high CO coverages, the H* is actually weakened substantially during true operating conditions, an effect that suppresses the HER activity of Zn-Cu more so than with Zn (Supplementary Fig. 18). As revealed by the binding configurations, the two metals of the Zn-Cu site synergistically contribute to the COOH* stabilization through Cu-C and Zn-O coordination, respectively (Fig. 4c). CO and OH adsorption energies on individual Zn and Cu sites demonstrate the relatively stronger carbophilicity of Cu and stronger oxophilicity of Zn (Supplementary Fig. 19). Similarly, the Zn-Cu dual site in Zn1Cu8 also has a more negative ∆G ads COOH* than the monometallic Cu site (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 20). This is in agreement with the experimental results (Supplementary Fig. 14): an enhanced CO formation activity is observed on the Cu-rich Zn-Cu surface, while retaining the Cu-like ability for further reduction of CO into multi-carbon products. The ∆G ads COOH* as a function of the Zn/Cu composition displays a non-monotonic correlation (Fig. 4d) and thus demonstrates the key role of the bimetallic sites in optimizing the reaction energetics. ∆G ads COOH* and ∆G ads H* are usually used to assess the CO2R to CO and HER activity, respectively, 58 and narrowing the difference between the two (∆(∆G) = ∆G ads COOH* -∆G ads H* ) can lead to an onset potential of CO2R closer to that of HER. Note that the Volmer step in HER is inherently different in reaction nature from COOH formation and thus ∆(∆G) can only serve as a relative measurement of CO2R-to-CO vs. HER selectivity. Deeper understanding of the factors that control selectivity necessitates sophisticated electrochemical barrier calculations. Field-stabilization of a bent CO2* intermediate involved in COOH formation also contributes to favoring CO2R over the HER. 59 By comparing ∆G ads COOH* and ∆G ads H* in a range of stepped metal surfaces, we find that Zn-rich Zn11Cu1 exhibits the smallest ∆(∆G) among all the weak-binding elementary metals known for catalyzing CO2R to CO whereas strong-binding metals with even smaller ∆(∆G) suffer from strong CO poisoning effect that limits their CO2R activity (Supplementary Fig. 21). CO poisoning is known to have a more profound effect on CO2R than HER owing to the stronger lateral interaction between adsorbed CO* and CO2R intermediates (CO* and COOH*) than H*. 60 Overall, the reduced ∆(∆G) from pristine Zn to Zn11Cu1, along with a moderate CO binding strength on Zn11Cu1, comprises the main mechanistic insight for the enhanced CO production activity and selectivity on bimetallic Zn-Cu (5s). Evaluating the long-term stability of Zn-Cu (5s) and its performance in comparison to precious metal catalysts. As shown by SEM and XPS data, the nanostructure and surface composition of the Zn-Cu (5s) electrode are relatively unchanged after 1 hour of CO2R testing (Supplementary Fig. 12). Longer-term testing over 20 hours indicates that the CO production rate remains relatively stable; there is a minor decrease in selectivity for CO2R to CO (95% to 86% FE) due an increase in the HER over time (Supplementary Fig. 13). This increase in the HER is likely due to electroplating of trace impurities (e.g. transition metals) onto the cathode over long periods. Nonetheless, this initial stability test indicates that Zn-Cu (5s) is promising for long-term application in CO2R electrolyzes.To assess a broader range of Zn-Cu bimetallic compositions, the study of sputtered films was extended to a composition library in which 5 compositions spanning 4% to 70% Zn were synthesized.

        <p>As we discuss above, to the best of our knowledge there has not been a previous report of an earth abundant bimetallic that has better or similar intrinsic activity for CO2R to CO than Ag or Au, which are precious metals that are typically the major or only constituents of state-of-the-art catalysts. An analysis of CO2R on Zn-Cu (5s), Ag, and Au foils as a function of the electrode potential demonstrates that Zn-Cu (5s) has comparable selectivity for CO production as Ag and Au (Fig. 5) and slightly improved intrinsic activity than Ag for CO2R to CO. As COOH formation usually involves the formation of a partially charged intermediate, bent CO2*, Au has an exceptional ability to stabilize this intermediate through strong interfacial electric fields as it has the most positive potential of zero charge among metal catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 22). 59 While Zn-Cu (5s) is less intrinsically active for CO2R to CO than Au, these results indicate that earth abundant bimetallics could potentially serve as suitable replacements for precious metal catalysts in CO2 electrolyzers. CO2R to CO on Zn-Cu (powder) at high reaction rates. Based on the above insights, we integrated Zn-Cu catalysts onto gas diffusion electrodes (GDE) to evaluate their performance within a GDE reactor at industrially relevant reaction rates. Commercial Zn powder was used to prepare Zn-Cu (powder) by utilizing the same galvanic exchange procedure described above, and the particles were subsequently integrated onto GDEs to evaluate for CO2R in 1.0 M KOH (more details on the reaction conditions can be found in the Methods section). A direct comparison of Zn-Cu (powder) GDEs with Zn GDEs at a given current density shows significantly enhanced CO2R selectivity to CO and decreased HER selectivity for the Zn-Cu system (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 5), commensurate with the trends described above for the planar Zn-Cu and Zn electrodes. Notably, the differences in product selectivity are more pronounced at higher current densities, demonstrating the advantages of incorporating a small amount of Cu into Zn for applications that require high total reaction rates. Although our Zn-Cu GDEs are not as performant as state-of-the-art Ag-based GDEs, 62,63 we suggest that further research to optimize the catalyst layer 62 will close this performance gap. A considerable portion of the FE is unaccounted for in the measured product distribution for the GDEs with pure Zn, indicating possible corrosion/deposition processes that take place concurrently with CO2R. As Pourbaix analysis suggests that Zn is unlikely to be stable 61 under the alkaline conditions of our CO2R measurements, we hypothesize that surface redox processes underpinning durability such as corrosion and deposition lead to losses in FE under these operating conditions. In contrast, nearly all the FE is accounted for with the Zn-Cu (powder) GDEs, suggesting that incorporating Cu imparts stability to Zn electrocatalysts. Future operando studies using synchrotron X-ray techniques could probe this dynamic reaction environment, providing insights on how to develop more robust systems under these harsh reaction conditions.As we discuss above, to the best of our knowledge there has not been a previous report of an earth abundant bimetallic that has better or similar intrinsic activity for CO2R to CO than Ag or Au, which are precious metals that are typically the major or only constituents of state-of-the-art catalysts.

        <p>We present bimetallic Zn-rich Zn-Cu as a highly efficient CO2R to CO electrocatalyst prepared by a facile galvanic procedure. The Zn-Cu catalyst exhibits dramatically improved selectivity and activity for CO formation compared to those of pristine Zn and Cu electrocatalysts, and remarkably, also shows higher intrinsic activity than a planar Ag catalyst within the operating potential window from -0.8 to -1.0 V vs. RHE. This enhanced intrinsic activity for CO formation on Zn-Cu catalysts is attributed to the electronic effect originating from the Cu adatoms on the Zn surface. DFT calculations suggest that the incorporation of Cu onto the Zn surface lowers the reaction energy (from 0.44 eV to 0.15 eV) of the potential-determining step to form COOH*, which improves CO production rates, while suppressing the HER due to a higher coverage of CO that impedes H adsorption. The changes in these relative energies rationalize the enhanced CO production activity and selectivity of Zn catalysts with Cu modification. Based on our fundamental studies involving planar electrodes, we then prepared a Zn-Cu powder catalyst and integrated it into a vapor-fed reactor. These gas-diffusion electrodes also showed efficient CO2-to-CO performance at industrially relevant reaction rates, consistent with expectations based on the prior studies. Overall, our work highlights the benefits of rationally designed bimetallic catalyst systems; a constructive ligand effect can modify the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces to tune the overall catalytic performance.We present bimetallic Zn-rich Zn-Cu as a highly efficient CO2R to CO electrocatalyst prepared by a facile galvanic procedure.

The resulted Zn-Cu powders were dried in air. It was then mechanically grinded using a small-size laboratory mortar for 1 minute until a fine and homogeneous powder was obtained. The powder was then suspended as a 10 mg mL -1 aqueous ethanol ink supplemented by a perfluorinated sulfonic acid ionomer, Nafion, as a catalyst binder. The Nafion/catalyst ratio was set equal to 8.7 wt.%. The ink was then sonicated for 10 minutes to ensure homogeneous dispersion of the catalyst and ionomer in the ink. 130 μL of the as-prepared ink was then drop-casted onto 1 cm 2 gas-diffusion layers to reach a catalyst loading of 1.3 mg catalyst.cm -2 . During the deposition, the gas-diffusion layers were maintained on a 60°C-hot plate to facilitate solvent evaporation.

        <p>Electrochemical Measurements. A multichannel potentiostat (Bio-Logic VMP3) was used for all the electrochemical measurements in this study. A two compartment electrochemical cell, 36 comprising a typical three-electrode system was used for all the aqueous CO2R experiments: Znbased electrodes as working electrodes (5.9 cm 2 geometric area exposed); a platinum foil as the counter electrode; and an Ag/AgCl electrode (Accumet) as the reference electrode. Selemion AMV (AGC Inc.) was introduced as the anion exchange membrane in between the counter and working electrode compartments. A small distance (&lt; 0.5 cm) between the reference and working electrodes was ensured to the electrolyte resistance. Dry CO2 gas was humidified by KHCO3 solution before flow through the electrochemical cell, with a flow rate of 20 sccm regulated by a mass flow controller (πMFC, MKS Instruments). A 0.1 M solution of KHCO3 saturated with CO2 (pH = 7.2) was prepared as the electrolyte.Electrochemical Measurements.

Each 15 min electrolysis experiment was performed in a batch reactor mode where recirculation of electrolyte resulted in rapid concentration of reaction products for analytical quantification. Note that the surface concentration of dissolved CO2 may be slightly lower than in traditional experiments, and the catalyst is continually exposed to reaction products from prior passes of the electrolyte.High Throughput catalyst screening.

        <p>Computational details. To simulate the above synthesized Zn-rich and Cu-rich Zn-Cu bimetallic catalysts, two stepped Zn-Cu surfaces, hcp Zn11Cu1(100) and fcc Zn1Cu8(211), were constructed from original hcp Zn(100) and fcc Cu(211) surfaces, respectively, by replacing a certain fraction of the step atoms with other metal atoms (Supplementary Fig. 15). Step atoms were selected for replacement due to their low cohesive energies and the Zn:Cu ratio was set to be close to the experimental values. Pure fcc metal (211) surfaces and hcp Zn(100) surfaces were also simulated for comparison. Adsorption energies were calculated using DFT with a periodic plane-wave implementation and ultra-soft pseudopotentials using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO code, 66 interfaced with the 
            <rs type="software">Atomistic Simulation Environment (ASE)</rs>. 67 We applied the BEEF-vdW functional, which provides a reasonable description of van der Waals forces while maintaining an accurate prediction of chemisorption energies. 68 Plane-wave and density cutoffs were 500 and 5000 eV, respectively, with a Fermi-level smearing width of 0.1 eV. In general, the adsorption energies on fcc (211) surfaces were evaluated using four-metal-layer (3 × 1) supercells with the bottom two metal layers constrained and a vacuum layer of 20 Å, and (4 × 4 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids were used; 69 while for hcp (100) surfaces, four-metal-layer (3 × 2) supercells with the bottom two metal layers constrained and a vacuum layer of 20 Å, and (4 × 3 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids were used. For the density of states (DOS) calculation, (8 × 8 × 1) and (8 × 6 × 1) Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids 69 were used for the fcc (211) and hcp (100) surfaces, respectively. All structures were optimized until the force components were less than 0.05 eV Å -1 . A dipole correction was applied to decouple the electrostatic interaction between the periodically repeated slabs. The free energy of H2(g) was corrected by + 0.09 eV as reported by Studt. et al. 70 The free energy of CO2(g) was corrected by +0.33 eV to address the overestimation of CO2 adsorption energies in DFT. Based on previous analysis, 71,72 the solvation energetic corrections of -0.25 eV and -0.06 eV were considered for COOH* and CO*, respectively.
