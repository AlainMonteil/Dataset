        <p>This paper examines the dynamic relationship between the oil market and stock markets from two perspectives: dependence between the crude oil market (WTI) and stock markets of the US and China, and volatility spillovers between them during 1991-2016. We further analyze structural breaks of market dependences and consider the extent of their influence on such relationships. Our vine-copula results show that the dependences between the three paired markets, WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China, vary dynamically across the six identified structural break periods. In particular, the dependence between WTI-US is stronger and more volatile than that between WTI-China during most of the periods. The dependence between US-China remains at a lower level in the earlier periods, but increases in the final period. Our VAR-BEKK-GARCH results demonstrate distinctive volatility spillovers across these periods, with varying directionality, in response to the structural changes. Overall, our results indicate that the oil market stimulates rapid and continual fluctuations in market dependences, which become manifest most acutely in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2007-08, demonstrating the increasing interdependence between the oil and stock markets. Further, the growing influence of China on the dynamics of these relationships, in the period following the Great Recession, presents evidence that it begins to assume an increasingly important role in global economic recovery.This paper examines the dynamic relationship between the oil market and stock markets from two perspectives: dependence between the crude oil market (WTI) and stock markets of the US and China, and volatility spillovers between them during 1991-2016.

        <p>Oil-price volatility has increasingly been the focus of extensive research, as fluctuations in the oil price have generated an unpredictable impact on the trajectory of world oil pricing and, in turn, financial markets (Kang et al., 2015;Wen et al., 2012;Bai and Kai, 2018). Complicating this relationship is the propensity of movements in the stock market to spill over into the oil market, and vice versa. The development of effective techniques to predict market movements, and evaluate the effects of such interactions, is an objective that researchers have long been seeking to achieve (Naifar and Dohaiman, 2013). With the increased complexities of world economies and financial markets, coupled with the growing power of emerging market economies, fluctuations in oil and stock market movements would arguably have even greater endogenous and exogenous consequences for the interactions between the world oil and financial markets. It is with these issues in mind that we examine the dependence between the oil and stock markets and the trajectories of spillovers amongst them, founding our study on West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and the US and China stock markets.Oil-price volatility has increasingly been the focus of extensive research, as fluctuations in the oil price have generated an unpredictable impact on the trajectory of world oil pricing and, in turn, financial markets (Kang et al., 2015;Wen et al., 2012;Bai and Kai, 2018).

        <p>Existing research examines numerous complexities in the relationship between oil prices and equity returns based on statistical regularities of pricing (Hamilton, 2009). Many studies use linear models, such as the vector autoregressive (VAR), to examine the dynamic relationship between the oil and stock markets in respect of their mutual dependence (Antonakakis and Filis, 2013;Arouri et al., 2010;Bjørnland, 2009;Broadstock and Filis, 2014;Filis et al., 2011;Lee and Zeng, 2011;Wang et al., 2013). However, these models have been unable to capture nonlinear aspects of the complex relationship, whether it be dynamically or asymmetrically (tail) dependent.Existing research examines numerous complexities in the relationship between oil prices and equity returns based on statistical regularities of pricing (Hamilton, 2009).

        <p>Recent investigations have employed the time-varying copula model to account for non-linear oil and stock market dynamics. A number of studies demonstrate variously a nonlinear relationship; increased tail dependence among international stock markets (Christoffersen et al., 2012); a dynamic tail dependence exhibited in crude oil prices (Avdulaj and Barunik, 2015); a dynamic dependence between the oil market and stock markets before and after the financial crisis (Zhu et al., 2014); and strength of tail dependence and contagion risk in transition economies (Aloui et al., 2013). Although the time-varying copula can determine the dependence between two paired markets, it is not directly applicable when the interactions of multi-markets are the subjects of analysis.Recent investigations have employed the time-varying copula model to account for non-linear oil and stock market dynamics.

        <p>Further studies overcome these limitations by adopting the vine copula model to account for the dependence among markets with high-dimensional complexity. These studies consistently show that this model can effectively capture the dependences among high dimension relationship (Weiß and Supper, 2013;Kraus and Czado, 2017;Allen et al., 2013;Brechmann et al., 2013); while it has also demonstrated superior performance in estimating the nonlinear relationship, including tail dependence (Charpentier and Segers, 2007). Despite these advantages, the vine copula model is unable to ascertain the direction of such dependences.Further studies overcome these limitations by adopting the vine copula model to account for the dependence among markets with high-dimensional complexity.

        <p>At the same time, researchers explore price volatility using multivariate GARCH models to facilitate analysis of multi-dimensional relationships among the markets (e.g., Awartani and Maghyereh, 2013;Du and He, 2015;Zhang and Wang, 2014;Jouini, 2013;Sadorsky, 2012). Chuang (2007) and Salisu and Mobolaji (2013) use the VAR-BEKK-GARCH model to analyze the role of volatility spillovers among multi-markets, arguing that this model can produce more accurate forecasts than traditional multivariate GARCH; while some of the traditional GARCH models are limited to modelling extreme cases of risk spillover, such as the GED-GARCH model (Fan, 2008); or require more parameters for estimation, such as the DCC-MECGARCH model (Tsuji, 2018). Further research finds supportive evidence that the VAR-BEKK-GARCH is more efficient, as it requires fewer parameters when analyzing spillovers among several markets (e.g., Schreiber, 2012;Stelzer, 2008;Carpantier and Samkharadze, 2013).At the same time, researchers explore price volatility using multivariate GARCH models to facilitate analysis of multi-dimensional relationships among the markets (e.g., Awartani and Maghyereh, 2013;Du and He, 2015;Zhang and Wang, 2014;Jouini, 2013;Sadorsky, 2012).

        <p>While acknowledging the valuable contribution made by prior research, we contend that shortcomings still remain. First, relationships between and among the markets have become increasingly complicated and multi-dimensional, and early research has been unable to account for dependence and volatility together, to gain a more complete understanding of the nature of underlying risks (Reboredo, 2015;Bekiros and Uddin, 2017;Liu et al., 2017).While acknowledging the valuable contribution made by prior research, we contend that shortcomings still remain.

        <p>Moreover, most existing studies investigating multi-market dependence relationships have not considered structural breaks and regime changes, which may have stimulated rapid and continually changing volatilities in markets over an extended period of time (e.g., Nguyen, 2012;Sukcharoen et al., 2014;Ji et al., 2018;Zhang, 2017). Even when structural breaks are considered, these studies examine structural breaks in relation to stand-alone markets, rather than dependences between multi-markets that are interacting (e.g., Aloui and Aïssa, 2016), failing to account for structural changes to the interdependence between the markets across temporal subdivisions.Moreover, most existing studies investigating multi-market dependence relationships have not considered structural breaks and regime changes, which may have stimulated rapid and continually changing volatilities in markets over an extended period of time (e.g., Nguyen, 2012;Sukcharoen et al., 2014;Ji et al., 2018;Zhang, 2017).

        <p>Thus, in our study, we seek to overcome the limitations of earlier researches by examining high-dimensional dependences and risk transmission between the oil and stock markets, and, at the same time, incorporate structural breaks of market dependence into the analysis of such/these relationships. The areas of interest are the crude oil market, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), and two stock markets: the US and China's stock markets. First, we employ the time-varying copula model to examine the dynamics of the relationships among these three markets. Second, to refine our investigation of these relationships still further, we conduct an analysis of structural breaks of the dynamic relationship among the three markets.Thus, in our study, we seek to overcome the limitations of earlier researches by examining high-dimensional dependences and risk transmission between the oil and stock markets, and, at the same time, incorporate structural breaks of market dependence into the analysis of such/these relationships.

        <p>Our study covers a period of 26 years, during which there have been structural changes caused by significant global events of an economic or political nature. As our focus is on dependences between the three markets, we choose to test and distinguish each structural break in their interdependence, rather than a structural break in each individual market, to account for the nature of regime changes taking place with the power to drive fluctuations in the dynamic relationships. Third, we apply the vine copula model to estimate the dependence relationship between the three paired markets: WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China, across the structural break periods. Fourth, we take one step further to ascertain the direction of such dependences across the temporal subdivisions by examining volatility spillovers between the markets utilizing the trivariate VAR-BEKK-GARCH model.Our study covers a period of 26 years, during which there have been structural changes caused by significant global events of an economic or political nature.

        <p>We choose WTI to represent the oil market because it is one of the foremost global oil markets and is used predominantly as a benchmark in world oil pricing in existing studies (Bekiros and Diks, 2008). We choose the US and China's stock markets for the analysis because their economies are the two most powerful and dynamic in the world. The US stock market is the most influential in global financial markets, and China's stock market is also important in its own right, partly because it may act as a surrogate for emerging economies (Liu et al., 2018), and partly because its increasing economic power is likely to exert a considerable influence over world markets in the not-too-distant future (Jiang et al., 2018).We choose WTI to represent the oil market because it is one of the foremost global oil markets and is used predominantly as a benchmark in world oil pricing in existing studies (Bekiros and Diks, 2008).

        <p>We believe that a study of their interactions over a significant length of time is of interest, given the changing dynamics of the US and China in terms of their influence over the global economy, and thereby seek to demonstrate that this gradual transformation is reflected in the dependence and directionality of spillovers. More significantly, the global interdependence of national economies, aggravating the economic consequences of risk contagion between the oil and financial markets, make it imperative to comprehend this complex phenomenon and how it influences the magnitude and trajectory of financial market adjustments and their interactions with the oil market.We believe that a study of their interactions over a significant length of time is of interest, given the changing dynamics of the US and China in terms of their influence over the global economy, and thereby seek to demonstrate that this gradual transformation is reflected in the dependence and directionality of spillovers.

        <p>Our study derives several significant findings. First, we establish the existence of a dynamic dependence between the oil and stock markets and between the stock markets themselves. Second, our results clearly identify five structural breaks of market dependence, which correspond to dependence volatilities precipitated by significant structural changes of an economic or political nature. Third, our analysis demonstrates that the dependences between the oil market and the two stock markets become stronger, and their tail dependences become more asymmetric with the escalating gravity of regime changes. Among these, the oil market plays a dominant role in these relationships, stimulating rapid and continual fluctuations in market dependences and transmitting information that generates extreme volatilities. The dependence between WTI-US is stronger and more volatile than that between WTI-China during most of these periods. In comparison, the dependence between US-China remains at a lower level in the earlier periods, but increases in the final period, which is evidence of the increasingly important part that it plays in the ordering of global economics.Our study derives several significant findings.

        <p>Fourth, risk volatilities transmit among the three markets dynamically over the six periods in response to economic and political structural changes. Volatility spills unidirectionally from the oil market to the US and China's stock markets, demonstrating that the crude oil market is dominant in determining the direction of volatilities between the markets, whose effect becomes manifest most acutely in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis of 2007-08. Risk volatility is transmitted, however, unidirectionally from the US market to China's stock market during the early periods, and turns bidirectional in the final period, providing further evidence that the increasing power of China's stock market is strengthening the financial signals that it transmits.Fourth, risk volatilities transmit among the three markets dynamically over the six periods in response to economic and political structural changes.

        <p>Our contribution to the literature consists in presenting new evidence of the dependence relationships and spillovers between the oil and stock markets. First, we establish the interdependence and spillovers between the crude oil market and the two most important economies in the world: namely the US and China's markets, over an extended horizon, which has not been explored in previous studies. Second, we introduce structural breaks of market dependence, for the first time, into an analysis of the dependence relationship and risk transmission between the oil and stock markets over a protracted period, incorporating significant political and economic structural changes that may have exerted a transformative effect on the global economy, thus offering a new insight into economic horizon analyses.Our contribution to the literature consists in presenting new evidence of the dependence relationships and spillovers between the oil and stock markets.

        <p>Third, we construct an evaluation procedure for measuring and analyzing dependence and spillovers between oil and stock markets by means of the vine copula model and multivariate (trivariate) GARCH model, accounting for their connection with changing structural regimes.Third, we construct an evaluation procedure for measuring and analyzing dependence and spillovers between oil and stock markets by means of the vine copula model and multivariate (trivariate) GARCH model, accounting for their connection with changing structural regimes.</p>
        <p>Our evaluation procedure has value for both practice and policy alike, aiding governments, market-makers and investors in the examination of similar phenomena in other countries and contexts. From a policy perspective, this lens provides a vital focus for policy-makers, enabling them to perceive the dynamic interactions of powerful markets and how these may impact upon other regions of the world, and meanwhile empower them to develop strategies to encourage long-term, maintainable economic growth. The insights gained from the investigation into the dynamics of interdependence between WTI, US and China may be fruitfully applied to other economies, their national idiosyncrasies notwithstanding. From a practice perspective, our research will enable investors to identify the causes and trajectories of volatilities and manage the investment risk and efficiency of their portfolios at a time of increasing global market instability.Our evaluation procedure has value for both practice and policy alike, aiding governments, market-makers and investors in the examination of similar phenomena in other countries and contexts.

        <p>We proceed in four steps. First, we adopt the time-varying copula model for estimating the dynamic dependence relationship between the crude oil market and stock markets in the US and China. Second, major economic and political events have occurred during our extended period of study, which may have impacted upon the relationships among the markets. To account for structural changes, we identify what we term the structural break of market dependence, precipitated by economic or political events, and examine the dependence and spillovers between the paired markets over each of the identified temporal subdivisions. Third, we consider the dependence between the three paired markets: WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China, in each period that we identify, by applying the vine copula model. The latter has an ability to estimate high-dimensional dependence and tail dependence among different markets, and can capture the nonlinear relationship in multi-markets. During this process, we also identify the root nodes for each period, facilitating our examination of how the risk information is received and disseminated in the course of market interactions. Fourth, we adopt the VAR-BEKK-GARCH model to examine if, and how, volatility spills across these markets and periods, and employ the Wald test to determine the direction of the spillover effect between the markets.We proceed in four steps.

        <p>It is established that oil and financial data is characterized by fat tail and high kurtosis (Bauwens and Lubrano, 2002;Ghose and Kroner, 1995). The GARCH model has the ability to match fat tail and high kurtosis characteristics of data, and, thus, can be used to compute marginal distribution in order to transform oil and stock price data to make it suitable for estimation by the copula models. We adopt the Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle GARCH (1, 1) model (GJR-GARCH (1, 1) for short), and combine it with the AR(1), on the basis that the AR(1)-GJR-GARCH(1, 1) model is suitable for estimating the marginal distribution (Aloui et al., 2013). In this way, our estimations can better capture non-linear features of oil price and stock price, and ensure an accurate estimation of the time-varying copula model and vine copula model. Given that the standardized residual follows the skewed student-t distribution, the model of AR(1)-GJR-GARCH(1, 1) is given below. K t-1 equal to 0; and K t-1 equal to 1 when the residual, ɛ t , is negative. After these procedures, oil and stock market price characterizing fat tail and high kurtosis will be transformed into data that follows a uniform distribution within [0, 1], which are suitable for estimation by the copula models.It is established that oil and financial data is characterized by fat tail and high kurtosis (Bauwens and Lubrano, 2002;Ghose and Kroner, 1995).

        <p>To examine the dynamic relationship between each paired market, we adopt the time-varying copula model. Both the Clayton copula model (Clayton, 1978) and symmetrized Joe-Clayton (SJC) copula model (Patton, 2006) have the ability to address tail dependence in the financial data. The two models differ in respect of tail dependence. The Clayton copula model deals with lower tail dependence, while the SJC copula model deals with both upper and lower dependence.

        <p>Based on the dynamic dependence relationship between the oil and stock markets, we consider if there are structural breaks of the dependence relationship between these markets over a 26-year horizon. During our study period, some major economic and political events occurred, such as the first Gulf War of 1991, the Iraq War of 2003, the September 11 th attack of 2001, and the financial crisis of 2007-08. As our focus is on the dependences between the three markets, we choose to test the structural breaks of the dependence between them, rather than a structural break in each individual market. Analyses based on an individual market cannot be extrapolated to capture the dependence between markets. By analyzing structural breaks of dynamic dependence among multiple markets, we are able to account for the stability of market interdependence in such relationships.Based on the dynamic dependence relationship between the oil and stock markets, we consider if there are structural breaks of the dependence relationship between these markets over a 26-year horizon.

        <p>The vine copula model is an extension of the time-varying copula model and is introduced to examine dependence among markets with high-dimensional complexity by Joe (1997) and Aas (2009). The vine copula model has the ability to analyze high dimensional dependence relationships among three markets or more. When more markets are included in the analysis, they interact with one another, so that the network of dependence relationships among them becomes increasingly complex. As a consequence, the parameters to be estimated increase exponentially. Clearly, modelling the interrelationships of the three-market networks in our study requires the application of the vine copula model.The vine copula model is an extension of the time-varying copula model and is introduced to examine dependence among markets with high-dimensional complexity by Joe (1997) and Aas (2009).

        <p>As shown, the vine copula model can only estimate the dependence relationship between the markets. The direction of their dependence, such as spillovers of risk volatility from one market to another, cannot be deduced from the copula models directly. To resolve this, we adopt the trivariate VAR-BEKK-GARCH model, which is able to ascertain the direction of volatility spillovers between multi-markets. The VAR-BEKK-GARCH model, a multivariate GARCH model proposed by Engle and Kroner (1995), estimates the conditional mean function and the conditional volatility function of high-dimensional relationships, which we use to test volatility spillovers between multi-markets.

Table 3 reports Figure 2 shows that the dependence between WTI and the Shanghai Composite Index fluctuates within the range of 0.005 -0.06. By the BP test, the Schwarz Criterion is the smallest (-9.6009) when the number of breakpoints is zero, and when the number of breakpoints is one, the Schwarz Criterion is the second smallest (-9.5992). There is less evidential support for distinctive structural breaks of the dependence relationship between WTI and China's stock market. The dynamic dependence between the US and China's stock markets is sustained at the lowest level throughout these periods, as depicted in Figure 3. The dependence fluctuates within the range of 0 -0.14 in most observations. By the BP test, the Schwarz Criterion is the smallest (-8.8649) when the number of breakpoints is zero. When the number of breakpoints is one, the Schwarz Criterion is the second-smallest (-8.8627). These statistics show that the dependence relationship is relatively stable between the US and China's stock markets in comparison to WTI and the US stock market. Overall, our results show that the dependence between WTI-US is much more volatile than that between WTI-China, while the US-China dependence is fairly stable. As the five structural breakpoints identified for WTI-US incorporate transformative events, influencing the global economy through these periods, it is to be expected that the stability of the oil and stock markets will be significantly affected across all the three paired markets. We thus apply the same structural breaks to WTI-China and US-China, so as to facilitate consistent comparisons based uniformly on the same periods. Therefore, we adopt the five structural breaks of the market dependence to determine the dependence and directionality of spillovers between the three paired markets. Based on these five breakpoints, we divide our data into the six periods as depicted in Figure 1 The foregoing analysis suggests that the generation of these breakpoints has resulted from economic stimuli. For example, the outbreak of wars in oil-producing countries affects the oil supply, which, in turn, is likely to increase the volatility of stock markets; while the shock of a financial crisis can render the latter even more unstable. A political crisis, possibly resulting in a radical change of regime, can have similar, destabilizing effects. As the timeline of Figure 1 shows, the extended period of our study incorporates a series of such destabilizing events, not the least of which is the Financial Crisis of 2007-08, and we are confident that our analysis has identified the significant breakpoints, which correspond to dependence volatilities precipitated by changes in response to the political and economic events that occur.Table 3 shows that for WTI-China, the AIC, BIC and Log-likelihood are at -5.3931, Notes.

        <p>Our results demonstrate that the dependences among the three markets undergo dynamic shifts through the six periods in response to the political and economic events that occur. In the periods of P1, P4 and P5, the crude oil market is identified as the root node, demonstrating that it is at the nexus of the dependence relationships between the three paired markets during these phases. It appears that the dependences of WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China increase from 0.03, -0.04 and 0.00 in P1 to 0.04, 0.04 and 0.02 in P4, and then to 0.34, 0.13 and 0.02 in P5, respectively, indicating that the dependences among the three markets grows stronger over the periods. The dependence manifests itself in the trajectory of a series of significant events that occur within these breaks. In P1, the Gulf War breaks out, with an invasion of Kuwait that threatens to restrict world oil supplies. P4 incorporates adverse developments following the Iraq War and, in particular, the onset of the Financial Crisis of 2007-08, both of which arguably have a significant impact on oil prices (Silvapulle et al., 2017;Bhar and Malliaris, 2011). This is consistent with the surging volatilities observed in P4 as depicted in Figure 1. In P5, the dependence between WTI-US and WTI-China remains at the highest levels (Kendall's τ = 0.34 and 0.13, respectively). The onset of the global financial crisis in 2007-08 produces the most extreme volatility of all breakpoints, as recorded in Figure 1, and this is further intensified in P5 by the European Debt Crisis and the Great Recession prevailing throughout this period, which threatens to destabilize the global financial system and world economy (Kousenidis et al., 2012).Our results demonstrate that the dependences among the three markets undergo dynamic shifts through the six periods in response to the political and economic events that occur.

        <p>Notably, the strongest dependence between WTI-China occurs in P5, by which time China has become the world's largest net importer of oil, with its increased demand having a significant effect on the oil market (Financial Times, 2015). Moreover, the energy market becomes more financialized at this time, with crude oil actively used as a hedging instrument in the spot and derivative markets (Bencivenga, 2012). Lin and Tamvakis (2001) find significant spillovers between crude oil futures markets between the New York and London markets; while Kang et al. (2017) show that spillovers from other commodity markets to the oil market, as the volatility receiver, increase during the 2008 Financial Crisis. It is therefore plausible to postulate that such crude oil derivatives stimulate spillovers from the oil market, and that they, in their turn, influence stock markets during periods of extreme volatility, thus strengthening the dependence between the oil and stock markets. Taking the observations together, it is reasonable to assert that dependence between the oil and stock markets grows stronger over these periods, in response to the escalating gravity of economic conditions.Notably, the strongest dependence between WTI-China occurs in P5, by which time China has become the world's largest net importer of oil, with its increased demand having a significant effect on the oil market (Financial Times, 2015).

        <p>Our results show that China's stock market develops into the root node in the period of P2, when the Asian financial crisis of 1997 breaks out. Since this crisis has its origin in Southeast Asia, the impact on the US market and crude oil market is transmitted ultimately through China. It appears, however, that during this phase the dependences between the three paired markets, especially WTI-China and US-China, are lower than the dependences in the periods when WTI and US stock market are the root nodes. This is arguably because China's stock market is not well integrated with the world economy after a long period of financial insularity, limiting its global influence. The dependence between the oil market and China's stock market also remains low. Notwithstanding that China's demand for oil increases during this period (Leung, et al., 2011), its dependence on this source of energy is far lower than that of the US, as much of its carbon-based power is derived from its vast coal deposits (Kumar et al., 2012). In addition, coal is significantly cheaper than oil (Chakravorty et al., 2008) and has its price controlled by the government (Chen and Lv, 2015). These observations are consistent with Figures 2 and3, which depict a lack of volatility, confirming that the dependences between China's stock market with the oil and US stock markets are not robust. The weight of evidence suggests that China, as the root node, is a volatility receiver from the oil and US stock markets, absorbing global volatilities during this phase.Our results show that China's stock market develops into the root node in the period of P2, when the Asian financial crisis of 1997 breaks out.

        <p>Consistent with the above observations, the tail dependence among the three markets is symmetrical (upper tail = 0.00, NA and NA; lower tail = 0.00, NA and NA for US-China, WTI-China and WTI-US, respectively). The tail dependence between WTI-US is close to zero and there is no tail dependence between US-China and WTI-China. These results further support the contention that when the China's stock market is the root node in P2, the impact of extreme risk on dependence between the three paired markets is limited. This is a further illustration that China's economy had not yet begun to exert a pervasive influence over world markets during this phase.Consistent with the above observations, the tail dependence among the three markets is symmetrical (upper tail = 0.00, NA and NA; lower tail = 0.00, NA and NA for US-China, WTI-China and WTI-US, respectively).

        <p>Further, our results show that the US stock market becomes the root node in the periods of P3 and P6. Albeit that the terrorist attack of September 11 takes place at the end of P2, it casts a long shadow over P3, generating long-term economic ramifications for the world's financial and oil markets and confirming that the US stock market is at the root of the contagion. Charles and Darné (2006), analyzing 10 daily stock market indexes, find supportive evidence that the terrorist attack and its aftermath cause large transient and permanent shocks to international stock markets. Similarly, the effects of the Afghanistan War of 2001, which occurs at the end of P2, arguably projects its influence over P3. Chossudovsky (2010) argues that a covert objective is to secure control of the country's vast, but as yet underdeveloped oil, natural gas and mineral resources, besides which this country has a strategic position standing at the crossroads of "pipeline routes and major oil and gas reserves". Therefore, it seems plausible that this geographically limited conflict would have ramifications much wider than its topographical scope, stimulating market interactions.Further, our results show that the US stock market becomes the root node in the periods of P3 and P6.

        <p>Furthermore, the outbreak of the Iraq War of 2003 delivers an oil shock to the world economy that has a significant and far-reaching influence on world demand and supply, the effect of which is ultimately transmitted through the US market. In a similar way to Chossudovsky (ibid.), Williams (2010) suggests that the conflict is evidence of competition between the great powers of the US and China to control global oil resources. Such implicit economic rivalry must, of itself, significantly influence crude oil pricing, and this factor is likely to have a progressively greater influence as demand for energy from China and other emerging nations grows.Furthermore, the outbreak of the Iraq War of 2003 delivers an oil shock to the world economy that has a significant and far-reaching influence on world demand and supply, the effect of which is ultimately transmitted through the US market.

        <p>Further, in P6, the world economy begins to emerge from the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nevertheless, although this is characterized as a period of modest, economic recovery (United Nations, 2013), extreme volatility persists for the best part of a decade, as we observe in Figure 1. Such increasing instability towards the end of the period may also have been provoked by two major events: China's stock market crash of 2016 and the OPEC decision to cut oil production (The Economic Times, 2016), intensifying market perceptions of risk and hence augmenting interactions among the three markets. This is supported by Kendall's τ (=0.05), which is the strongest at this point, confirming that the dependence between the US and China markets strengthens during this period. The US stock market once more plays a fundamental role, transmitting information through the medium of its powerful, global influence.Further, in P6, the world economy begins to emerge from the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

        <p>We now consider volatility spillovers between the three markets during the six structural break periods. Table 5 reports the results of the conditional variance and residual, obtained from estimation of the VAR(1)-BEKK-GARCH (1, 1) model. In Table 5, D (1, 2) indicates that the conditional variance of China's stock market affects the US stock market. A (1, 2) indicates that the residual of China's stock market affects the US stock market. When a spillover occurs, it is either unidirectional from market i to market j, and vice versa; or bidirectional between market i and market j. The rejection of the null hypothesis for two tests, i.e., A(i, j)=D(i, j)=0, and A(j, i)=D(j, i)=0, indicates that the spillover between market i and market j is bidirectional. The rejection of the null hypothesis of either of the two tests indicates that the spillover is unidirectional. The results show that the coefficients of the conditional variance and residual during the six periods are significant, at most times, at 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, which indicates that the spillovers between the three paired markets occur. But, the direction of the spillovers will be determined by the Wald test. The results of the Wald test are shown in Table 6. 8.8154, P=0.0001). The oil market, as the root node, performs its transmitting role in this multi-market dependence. During the P1 period, the Gulf War breaks out, generating a substantial shock to the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, so that aggregated oil shocks subsequently have a destabilizing impact on global markets, as suggested by Barsky and Kilian (2004). Our results are consistent with empirical evidence that the volatility of the oil price affects stock returns, with risk from the oil market transmitted to the stock market (Park and Ratti, 2008;Jammazi, 2014). Kilian and Park (2009) provide further evidence that the oil price has a significant effect on the US stock price. Further, our results show that the oil market is also affected by stock market movements, which is supported by Malik and Hammoudeh (2007), who find significant spillovers from the stock market to the oil market.We now consider volatility spillovers between the three markets during the six structural break periods.

        <p>However, there is no evidence to suggest the incidence of spillovers between the US and China's stock markets. This is arguably because the two markets demonstrate little interconnectedness during this phase, as evidenced in Table 4. China's stock market is established only at the end of 1991, after a long period of economic isolation. Since its trading and securities regulatory systems are at a formative stage, with quoted companies extensively controlled by the state or state-appointed nominees (Liu, et al., 2016;Liu, et al., 2018), inward investment and interactions with international markets are limited. Overall, the evidence suggests that the crude oil market takes a central position in the global economy during this period.However, there is no evidence to suggest the incidence of spillovers between the US and China's stock markets.

        <p>During the P2 period (root node: China), risk volatilities spill over from the oil market to provoking a global economic recession and depressing the aggregate demand for crude oil, which, in turn, WTI promptly transmits to the US and China stock markets. Wen et al (2012) examine the dependence between China's stock market and the oil market and find that it rises significantly during the crisis, supporting our postulation that spillovers spread swiftly to China, because of its increasing integration with external markets. It is worth noting that risk unidirectionally spills over from China's stock market to the US stock market (3.5492, P=0.0287), suggesting that the US stock market is extremely sensitive during the crisis period.During the P2 period (root node: China), risk volatilities spill over from the oil market to provoking a global economic recession and depressing the aggregate demand for crude oil, which, in turn, WTI promptly transmits to the US and China stock markets.

        <p>This is clear evidence that oil exerts a decisive influence in shaping stock market movements, acting as a point of entry for spillovers when the world economy has plunged into the recession. This is consistent with Table 4, which shows the strongest dependence between WTI-US and WTI-China, with the highest Kendall's τ at 0.34 and 0.13 of all the periods observed.

Awartani and Maghyereh (2013) also assert that the oil market plays a significant role in the information transmission mechanism after the crisis, spreading risk to stock markets. Furthermore, the risk in the US stock market is transmitted to China's stock market unidirectionally (2.9424, P=0.0527). The US stock market has become extremely volatile in the aftermath of its domestic financial catastrophe, and this volatility quickly spills over into other markets, China's included, on an unprecedented scale.This is clear evidence that oil exerts a decisive influence in shaping stock market movements, acting as a point of entry for spillovers when the world economy has plunged into the recession.

        <p>Moreover, the dependence between the two stock markets has grown stronger than ever, as evidenced in Table 4 (Kendall's τ =0.05), so that the risks inherent within these two markets will, thus, have an escalating effect on the crude oil market (2.8418, P=0.0583). China's interactions with the oil market and US market signifies that its economy is, by this period, more fully integrated into the world economy, and that economic globalization, and the degree of China's economic expansion, have helped to determine the nature of market risk transmission.Moreover, the dependence between the two stock markets has grown stronger than ever, as evidenced in Table 4 (Kendall's τ =0.05), so that the risks inherent within these two markets will, thus, have an escalating effect on the crude oil market (2.8418, P=0.0583).

        <p>Our study, for the first time, integrates the copula models and the multivariate GARCH model to analyze the dependence and spillovers between the oil market (WTI) and the US and China stock markets over the extended period of 1991-2016. We first analyze the dynamic dependence relationship between the three paired markets, i.e., WTI-US, WTI-China and US-China, using the time-varying copula model. We further conduct an analysis of structural breaks of market dependence between the paired markets, and incorporate the structural breaks into an analysis of the market dependences by applying the vine copula model, and determine the direction of risk transmission between the markets by applying the trivariate VAR-BEKK-GARCH model.

We draw three conclusions.</p>
        <p>First, dependences between the oil market and the stock markets are shaped by the impact of political and economic manifestations, which have a decisive effect on the nature of the interactions between them. This is demonstrated by the evidence that their dependences grow stronger during and after the Financial Crisis of 2007-08, and the tail dependence simultaneously turns asymmetric. Different markets act as the root nodes across the temporal subdivisions defined by the structural breaks, receiving and transmitting risk volatilities from and to the other markets and wielding varying degrees of influence over the market dependences. The oil market, in particular, stands at the nexus of the dependences, acting upon them to stimulate rapid and continual fluctuations. This effect manifests itself most acutely in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis, demonstrating the increasing interdependence of the oil and financial markets. Second, distinctive risk volatilities spill over between the markets, with varying directionality, activated by a series of significant economic and political events across the six structural break periods. The trajectories of these spillovers change direction across the temporal subdivisions, shaped by the strength of market dependence and interactions, which are, in their turn, modified by major changes of a political or economic nature. Crude oil is the strongest transmitter of all three, shaping the direction of volatilities between the markets. Third, and perhaps most interestingly of all, our analysis reveals that world economic power may now be in the midst of a transformation. The massive destabilization provoked by the Financial Crisis comes at the same time as China's burgeoning economic power and massive increase in domestic energy consumption (caused, in large part, by a growth in the private motoring sector), and development of trade initiatives such as One-Belt-One-Road initiative initiated in 2013 (Du and Zhang, 2018), have transformed it into the largest oil importer in the world (Financial Times, 2015). The results of our study suggest that China has now become a transmitter of volatility spillovers itself and a significant participant in the sphere of globalization. Our analysis thus provides evidence of the growing power of China's economy in relation to the US, suggesting the advent of global economic rebalancing.First, dependences between the oil market and the stock markets are shaped by the impact of political and economic manifestations, which have a decisive effect on the nature of the interactions between them. This is demonstrated by the evidence that their dependences grow stronger during and after the Financial Crisis of 2007-08, and the tail dependence simultaneously turns asymmetric. Different markets act as the root nodes across the temporal subdivisions defined by the structural breaks, receiving and transmitting risk volatilities from and to the other markets and wielding varying degrees of influence over the market dependences. The oil market, in particular, stands at the nexus of the dependences, acting upon them to stimulate rapid and continual fluctuations. This effect manifests itself most acutely in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis, demonstrating the increasing interdependence of the oil and financial markets. Second, distinctive risk volatilities spill over between the markets, with varying directionality, activated by a series of significant economic and political events across the six structural break periods. The trajectories of these spillovers change direction across the temporal subdivisions, shaped by the strength of market dependence and interactions, which are, in their turn, modified by major changes of a political or economic nature. Crude oil is the strongest transmitter of all three, shaping the direction of volatilities between the markets. Third, and perhaps most interestingly of all, our analysis reveals that world economic power may now be in the midst of a transformation. The massive destabilization provoked by the Financial Crisis comes at the same time as China's burgeoning economic power and massive increase in domestic energy consumption (caused, in large part, by a growth in the private motoring sector), and development of trade initiatives such as One-Belt-One-Road initiative initiated in 2013 (Du and Zhang, 2018), have transformed it into the largest oil importer in the world (Financial Times, 2015). The results of our study suggest that China has now become a transmitter of volatility spillovers itself and a significant participant in the sphere of globalization. Our analysis thus provides evidence of the growing power of China's economy in relation to the US, suggesting the advent of global economic rebalancing.</p>
        <p>Our research will help to improve regulation and practice. From the perspective of policy, our estimation procedure will enable governments and regulators to analyze and predict the formerly unforeseeable consequences of dynamic market interactions, facilitating the development of long-term policies to achieve consistent and sustainable growth. This is particularly important at a time when Middle Eastern conflicts, economic and financial market turmoil, and problematical attempts to ameliorate the effects of global warming are impacting unpredictably on the trajectories of world oil prices and financial markets. Moreover, the evaluation procedure that we have developed can be applied to examine similar phenomena in other countries and contexts and in different combinations. From the perspective of practice, our research provides an analytical procedure for investors and market-makers alike, enabling them to optimize their portfolios and minimize investment risk, especially during a period of intensifying global volatility. More importantly, our identification of China as an increasingly powerful transmitter of market information offers analysts an insight into similar phenomena in respect of other emerging economies.Our research will help to improve regulation and practice.

Especially, the kurtosis parameters, χ, and asymmetry parameters, η, of the three residual series are both statistically significant. These results indicate that the market returns for our analyses are characterized by fat tail and are asymmetrical, providing supportive evidence that linear models with normal distribution are inappropriate for estimating the relationships among the three markets.reports the estimated results of the marginal distribution of market returns.

        <p>During the P3 period (root node: US stock market), spillovers between the oil market and US stock market are bidirectional (6.8859, P=0.0010; 9.5308, P=0.0000). But the risk spills only from the US stock market to China's stock market (3.0809, P=0.0459), and from China's stock market to the oil market (5.2036, P=0.0055). During this period, the Iraq War breaks out, increasing the markets' perception of risk, and exerting an immediate spillover effect onto the US stock market; and, as is also likely, onto other sectors of the global economy. Moreover, the September 11 th attack at the end of the P2 period causes a moderate recession in the US that continues into P3, depressing its demand for crude oil and having an inhibiting effect on China's stock market and other markets besides. Mehrara (2007) finds that the oil and US stock markets act, respectively, as originators and transmitters of risk volatility, fundamentally affecting the world's economy and leading it into both contraction and growth. Our P3 analysis of how risk volatilities stem from successive crises, spilling over from the oil market to the US and China stock markets, as well as into other world markets, tends to support this thesis. In addition, our results show that risk is transmitted from China's stock market to the oil market during the P3 period. With China's inexorable ascent in the world economy, its slowly burgeoning stock market is beginning to exert an influence and leverage over the global oil market. Simultaneously, the special adjustment mechanism for oil pricing in China, first adopted during this period, may have also affected aggregate demand and supply in the international oil market (Chen and Lv, 2015), influencing international oil pricing and investment portfolios (Chai et al., 2011).During the P3 period (root node: US stock market), spillovers between the oil market and US stock market are bidirectional (6.8859, P=0.0010; 9.5308, P=0.0000).
