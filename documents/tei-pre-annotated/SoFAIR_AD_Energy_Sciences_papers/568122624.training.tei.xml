        <p>This study carried out comprehensive energy, exergy and economic analysis of ceramic foam/molten salt composite phase change material (CPCM) for use in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage systems. Ceramic foams with various pore configurations were fabricated and integrated with molten salt. A visualised experimental setup was built and a numerical model was developed to experimentally and numerically investigate the melting performance of ceramic foam-enhanced molten salt. It is found that compared to pure PCM, the melting rate of 10 PPI (Pores Per Inch), 15 PPI and 20 PPI CPCMs is increased by 51.5%, 51.5% and 39.4% respectively. Moreover, the porosity has a more remarkable effect on the enhancement in melting rate than pore density. The total stored energy is slightly decreased but the energy storage rate is greatly improved. The energy storage rate of CPCM with 0.80 porosity is increased by 73.2%. Exergy analysis indicates that the exergy efficiency of all CPCMs is more than 50% higher than that of pure PCM. At the benchmark price of ceramic foam, CPCMs with 0.80 and 0.85 porosities are economically feasible. The effective thermal energy stored per unit time and unit price can be increased by up to 58.0% and CPCMs with low porosity are more costeffective. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of ceramic foam in terms of enhancing the heat transfer performance of molten salt for the potential large-scale applications in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage.This study carried out comprehensive energy, exergy and economic analysis of ceramic foam/molten salt composite phase change material (CPCM) for use in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage systems.

        <p>Using renewable energy is one of the solutions to cope with the global energy crisis and the environmental issue [1,2]. However, some renewable energy resources, such as solar energy, have drawbacks of instability and intermittence, which impairs their efficiency [3][4][5]. Thermal energy storage (TES) technology stores surplus thermal energy during the peak period and releases it when the energy is needed, addressing the mismatch between energy supply and demand [6][7][8][9]. Currently, there are three TES technologies: sensible heat storage, latent heat storage and thermochemical reaction storage [10,11]. The thermochemical reaction storage technology is still in the preliminary research stage of the laboratory. Compared to sensible heat storage, latent heat storage is more attractive. It stores thermal energy in phase change materials (PCMs) and has a large energy storage density. Moreover, the temperature during the charging/discharging cycles can be maintained nearly constant [12][13][14]. Thus this technology is widely applied and studied [15]. However, almost all pure PCMs except metals suffer from low thermal conductivity, resulting in limited energy storage efficiency [16][17][18][19].Using renewable energy is one of the solutions to cope with the global energy crisis and the environmental issue [1,2].

        <p>Many people have studied enhancing the heat transfer of pure PCMs. Generally, there are about three categories of methods at the PCM side: inserting porous foams, using fins and adding nanoparticles. In terms of using porous foams, Zhang et al. [20] carried out experimental and numerical studies on the melting of paraffin/copper foam composite phase change material (CPCM). They found that although the porous copper foam suppressed natural convection, the paraffin/copper foam CPCM still had a faster melting rate than the pure paraffin. Zheng et al. [21] also used copper foam to enhance the energy storage performance of paraffin and studied the effect of heating positions. It is found that the complete melting time of CPCM was shortened by 20.5% compared to pure paraffin; the CPCM which was heated at the top melted slowest and had the largest temperature difference. Atal et al. [22] investigated the effect of the porosity of aluminium foam on the melting/solidification of paraffin in a shell-and-tube energy storage unit. Their results suggest that the metal foam with the lower porosity further shortens the charging/discharging time owing to the higher overall thermal conductivity. It should be noted that CPCMs in the above studies need containers (such as the shell-and-tube unit) because these foams are open-cell and the melted PCM would leak if no containers. To address the leakage issue, Grosu et al. [23] used hierarchical macro-nanoporous copper to impregnate paraffin. This new type of material shows superior anti-leakage capacity (due to capillary force in nanopores) and high energy density (due to macropores). And the thermal conductivity is improved three-fold. Regarding the use of fins, Yang et al. [24] conducted a numerical investigation on the melting process of paraffin in a vertical shell-and-tube energy storage unit with annular fins. The effects of fin number, height and thickness on the energy storage performance were analysed. In their study, the complete melting time of paraffin can be shortened by up to 65%. Huang et al. [25] designed tree-shaped fins for a vertical latent heat storage unit to enhance the heat transfer of lauric acid. Some people studied using nanoparticles. Al-Jethelah et al. [26] examined the melting process of CuO nanoparticle-enhanced coconut oil in a cavity. They found that the melting enhancement by nanoparticles was insignificant. Recently, the combination of different thermal enhancement methods is also attracting attention, such as the hybrid fin-metal foam [27,28]. It should be pointed out that most heat transfer enhancement methods aim at low-temperature PCMs. Molten salts are widely-used medium-and high-temperature PCMs [29], but due to corrosion and high temperature, many heat transfer enhancement methods do not apply.Many people have studied enhancing the heat transfer of pure PCMs. Generally, there are about three categories of methods at the PCM side: inserting porous foams, using fins and adding nanoparticles.

        <p>As ceramics have inherently high thermal conductivity, corrosion and high-temperature resistance [30][31][32][33], some people tried using ceramics to enhance the thermal performance of molten salts. Jiang et al. [34] designed three Na 2 SO 4 -NaCl/ceramic shaped-stabilised phase change materials (ss-PCMs) where pore size is on the micro and nano scale so the liquid PCM is restricted and the leakage is prevented. Wang et al. [35] fabricated a ternary salt/Si 3 N 4 ss-PCM using the pressure impregnation method and found that the thermal conductivity of the ss-PCM was more than 6 times higher than that of pure salt. Xu et al. [36] utilised the diatomite to load NaNO 3 . However, the ss-PCM was found to have a low thermal conductivity of ~0.5 W/(m⋅K). Authors added 10 wt% graphite and the thermal conductivity was improved six-fold. Liu et al. [37] used the foaming method to prepare an open-cell ceramic-based CPCM. The thermal conductivity of prepared CPCM is reported to be 31.8-52.6 W/(m⋅K). Luo et al. [38] fabricated nanoparticle-molten salt-ceramic CPCM with synergetic enhanced specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and optical absorption. However, most studies on ceramic-enhanced CPCM paid attention to material preparation and characterisation, while the heat transfer process and energy storage performance are poorly understood.As ceramics have inherently high thermal conductivity, corrosion and high-temperature resistance [30][31][32][33], some people tried using ceramics to enhance the thermal performance of molten salts.

        <p>Economic characteristic is another important criterion for determining the feasibility of the technology in practical applications. Some researchers have conducted the economic assessment of various heat transfer enhancement technologies. Xu et al. [39] numerically analysed the melting performance enhancement by copper foam in a shell-and-tube unit. They proposed an economic criterion, i.e. the ratio of total stored energy to the melting time and material cost. They concluded that the configuration was the most cost-effective when the price ratio of copper foam to PCM was larger than 5. Yang et al. [40] carried out a thermal and economic analysis of water/copper foam CPCM for air-conditioning applications. In terms of the economic assessment, they considered the manufacturing and welding costs of metal foam. They estimated that for a 30-year lifetime, the metal foam heat exchanger can save $ 425.6 k. Later, they proposed a hybrid fin-metal foam structure for solar thermal energy storage and used the same method to evaluate its economics [41]. They assumed the stored thermal energy was used to provide residential hot water and estimated the proposed structure can save $640.8 under a 30-year lifetime. However, current economic assessments mainly focus on metal foams and fins, rather than ceramics. Based on the literature review, it is found that there are few studies comprehensively evaluating ceramic-enhanced molten salt in terms of energy storage performance and economic feasibility, so the enhancement of ceramics is not fully understood, impeding the potential largescale applications in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage. In this paper, a comprehensive energy, exergy and economic analysis was carried out with the aim of fully recognising the potential of ceramics in the heat transfer enhancement of molten salts. Three ceramic foams with different pore densities were fabricated and integrated with molten salt to form molten salt/ceramic foam CPCMs. A visualised experimental setup was constructed and the enhancement effect of ceramic foams was experimentally investigated. In addition, a numerical model was developed and the effect of foam porosity was discussed. The energy and exergy analysis was carried out according to the numerical results. A new economic evaluation criterion was proposed based on the effective stored thermal energy and the economic feasibility of PCMs with various pore configurations was discussed. This study provides comprehensive energy, exergy and economic analysis of molten salt/ceramic foam CPCMs, paving the way for the potential large-scale applications in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage.Economic characteristic is another important criterion for determining the feasibility of the technology in practical applications.

        <p>The preparation process of ceramic foam is as follows: first, the PU (dimension: 50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm) foam was submerged in NaOH solution (concentration: 10 wt%) for 12 h to activate the surface [42].

        <p>To fabricate molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM, the ceramic foam was placed in a quartz cavity (inner dimension: length 50 mm × width 50 mm × height 55 mm; wall thickness: 2 mm) and the liquid solar salt was poured into the cavity. The impregnation ratio of salt was over 95%. The dimension of CPCM is 50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm. A gap of 5 mm was left between the top surface of CPCM and the cavity to allow the thermal expansion of CPCM. A typical application scenario of our CPCM is the shell-and-tube storage system where CPCM is placed in the annulus space and HTF flows through the tube. Unlike the packed-bed storage system, the CPCM is placed in a separate space and does not contact HTF, so it would not leak to HTF and the environment.To fabricate molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM, the ceramic foam was placed in a quartz cavity (inner dimension: length 50 mm × width 50 mm × height 55 mm; wall thickness: 2 mm) and the liquid solar salt was poured into the cavity.

        <p>A representative elementary volume (REV)-scale simulation was performed to assist in understanding the melting process [1]. The REV-scale simulation treats the porous CPCM as a uniformly mixed medium and does not require an accurate description of the porous skeleton. In other words, it ignores the complex geometric information of the medium. This method uses some statistical parameters, such as porosity, permeability and effective thermal conductivity, to characterize the porous structure. The disadvantage is that it cannot reveal the flow and heat transfer characteristics in pores. But due to the simple input and low computational cost, it is a powerful tool for simulating large-scale systems [44]. The modelling process will be introduced in the following subsections.A representative elementary volume (REV)-scale simulation was performed to assist in understanding the melting process [1].

        <p>The evolution of the melting front of pure molten salt and molten salt/ceramic foam CPCMs is presented in Fig. 5. For the pure molten salt, the solid-liquid phase interface is curved even at the initial melting stage (40 min). This is different from the melting of some organic PCMs where the phase interface is almost parallel to the heating wall at the initial stage [26]. The reason may be that the viscosity of liquid molten salt is lower than that of organic PCM [26], which results in stronger natural convection. With the elapse of time, more PCM is melted and the effect of natural convection is greater. As a result, the solid-liquid phase interface becomes more curved.The evolution of the melting front of pure molten salt and molten salt/ceramic foam CPCMs is presented in Fig. 5.

        <p>Fig. 9 shows the measured temperature at P1, P2 and P3. It is found that the temperature in CPCM rises faster than that in pure PCM. It should be attributed to the increased thermal conductivity: the thermal conductivity of pure molten salt is 0.59 W/(m⋅K); the effective thermal conductivity of molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM is 1.60 W/(m⋅K). The increased thermal conductivity contributes to the heat transfer from the heating wall to PCM. CPCM can absorb more heat and its temperature rises faster. It is noted that the enhancement effect of ceramic foam on temperature is more significant at points that are far away from the heating wall, namely P2 and P3. This phenomenon is consistent with the observation in Fig. 7. The reason lies in that the distance from P2/P3 to the heating wall is long and the enhancement effect of ceramic foam can be more exerted.Fig. 9 shows the measured temperature at P1, P2 and P3.

        <p>where δ is the cost ratio; p ceramic is the cost of ceramic foam, £0.41 is used as the benchmark price; p salt is the cost of solar salt in the case of pure molten salt. The energy storage economic index ϑ is defined as:where δ is the cost ratio; p ceramic is the cost of ceramic foam, £0.41 is used as the benchmark price; p salt is the cost of solar salt in the case of pure molten salt.

        <p>This index characterises the amount of effective thermal energy stored per unit time and unit price. The energy storage economic indexes of different PCMs are plotted in Fig. 15. At the benchmark cost ratio (δ = 0.41), ϑ of CPCMs with 0.80 and 0.85 porosities is higher than that of pure salt, suggesting these CPCMs are cost-effective. ϑ of CPCM with 0.80 porosity can be increased by up to 58.0%. When the cost ratio rises to 0.50, ϑ of CPCMs with 0.85 and 0.80 porosities is still higher than that of pure salt. With the decrease of the cost ratio, ϑ of CPCMs is significantly increased. CPCMs with 0.85 and 0.80 porosities have larger ϑ at all the four cost ratios. Overall, the energy storage cost is sensitive to the price of ceramic foam and CPCMs with low porosity are more costeffective.This index characterises the amount of effective thermal energy stored per unit time and unit price.

        <p>In the present study, the SiC ceramic foams with various pore configurations were fabricated and integrated with solar salt to enhance thermal energy storage performance. A visualised experimental setup was built and a numerical model was developed to investigate the melting performance of molten salt/ceramic foam composite phase change materials (CPCMs). This study provides comprehensive energy, exergy and economic analysis of ceramic foam-enhanced molten salt for use in medium and high-temperature thermal energy storage systems.

        <p>First, using the setup shown in Fig. 2(a), the quartz cavity containing the CPCM was heated by the left aluminium heater. The thermocouple measured the temperature of one point at the surface of the quartz cavity, and the infrared camera measured the same point using the spot measurement mode. A great number of points were selected and the measurement was carried out in the range of 25 • C-300 • C, which covered the temperature range in the actual experiments. This process was repeated three times to ensure accuracy.First, using the setup shown in Fig. 2(a), the quartz cavity containing the CPCM was heated by the left aluminium heater.
