        <p>This article analyzes the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) power sector pathway toward net-zero emissions in 2050. The ASEAN member states comprise Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. In 2018, the ASEAN energy sector contributed 1.4 gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions [4], constituting 4% of the global energy-related CO 2 emissions in the same year. ASEAN is home to more than 661 million people [5] and is one of the fastest-growing economic regions in the world [4]. Yet, ASEAN average electricity consumption per capita is still only 1,560 kW-hours (kWh), less than half of the global average of 3,300 kWh in 2018 [6]. This implies that electricity demand in ASEAN will continue to increase in the next decade. Accordingly, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected a rise in ASEAN energy-related CO 2 emissions to 2.4 Gt in 2040, 71% higher than the 2018-level. On the other hand, Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change [7,8]. Thus, it makes sense to see the ASEAN low-carbon pathway not only as a luxury imposed by the Paris Agreement but also as a necessity given the unprecedented impacts of climate change posed to the region itself.This article analyzes the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) power sector pathway toward net-zero emissions in 2050.

        <p>We assess the ASEAN power sector net-zero pathway using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) software developed by the 
            <rs type="creator">Stockholm Environment Institute</rs>. LEAP has been adopted by thousands of organizations in more than 190 countries worldwide [9], and has been used in 85 country reports under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and more than 70 peerreviewed journals papers [10]. Despite its widespread use, there is still a scarcity of publications that use the most recent LEAP capability for simulating energy storage. In this study, we utilize the Next Energy Modelling System for Optimization (NEMO) framework, which allows for the analysis of the role of energy storage and the development of robust climate change planning responses. We developed two other scenarios besides the net-zero emissions scenario, namely the reference scenario and the renewable energy target scenario. Thus, the net-zero pathway analysis includes a comparison with the reference and existing policy trajectory pathways, revealing additional measures required beyond the reference and current policies for the ASEAN power sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

        <p>This article makes two main contributions to the literature. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the ASEAN power sector pathway for net-zero emissions has been analyzed. We use countryspecific data and model the net-zero pathway for each of the 10 ASEAN member states, zooming in on the level of individual technologies. Subsequently, we consolidate the results at the ASEAN level. Secondly, we include an analysis of grid integration of variable renewable energy and the role of energy storage using the NEMO optimization framework, which facilitates energy storage capacity addition endogenously. This adds to the current publications using the LEAP methodological framework, allowing more robust climate mitigation policy modeling. Moreover, the methodological approach and the incorporation of energy storage in the modeling can be replicated for similar assessments in other regions or countries. Furthermore, this study involves a unique dataset on each ASEAN country, enabling a bottom-up, technological level analysis of the ASEAN power sector. Thus, this article provides a detailed overview of the current state and outlook of the ASEAN power sector in terms of technology mix, electricity generation, GHG emissions, and cost implications of different power sector development pathways.This article makes two main contributions to the literature.

        <p>Driven by rapid economic growth and urbanization, ASEAN electricity demand grew at an average rate of 6.3% between 2008 and [11]. The region has relied on fossil fuels to meet the growing demand. In 2020, fossil fuels made up 78% of the ASEAN electricity mix, shared between coal (44%), natural gas (32%), and oil (2%) (Fig. 1a) 1 . Hydropower accounted for 16% of the electricity mix while other renewables supplied only 6% of the region's electricity.Driven by rapid economic growth and urbanization, ASEAN electricity demand grew at an average rate of 6.3% between 2008 and [11].

        <p>The region's GHG emissions in 2020 reached 668 million tons CO 2 e (Fig. 1b). Coal contributed 72% of the carbon emissions, followed by natural gas (26%), and oil (2%). Comparing the ASEAN member states, the five largest contributors of GHG emissions were Indonesia (32.2%), Vietnam (18.8%), Malaysia (16.7%), Thailand (14%), and The Philippines (10.5%). The other five countries only accounted for less than 8% of the ASEAN power sector emissions in 2020, with Brunei being the smallest contributor.The region's GHG emissions in 2020 reached 668 million tons CO 2 e (Fig. 1b).

        <p>The ASEAN member states have committed to reducing their GHG emissions under the Paris Agreement. Their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) include strategies to increase renewable energy capacity. Table 1 summarizes the national renewable energy targets of each ASEAN country. Southeast Asia is blessed with vast renewable energy resources. Yet, they are currently underutilized. According to a study conducted by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [12], the ASEAN countries have an abundant potential for utility-scale, landbased wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) power development. Southeast Asia's total solar PV and wind power technical potential is 29,967 GWpeak (GWp) and 1,383 GWp, respectively. Besides solar and wind potentials, all ASEAN member states except for Singapore have hydropower resources (Table 2). Biomass potential is also present in eight Southeast Asian countries, above all Indonesia.The ASEAN member states have committed to reducing their GHG emissions under the Paris Agreement.

The mechanism was intended to increase power sector efficiencies and reduce electricity prices. By contrast, the liberalization of markets in the Philippines and Singapore was meant to ensure transparency, fair grid access, and attract a sufficient number of market players to achieve efficiency. The ASEAN member states are also diverse in terms of size, population, and development levels [11]. Despite various national contexts, grid interconnections have been built between some ASEAN countries, including Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam with 35 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power exchanged in 2019 alone [11]. Most of the interconnectors are between Thailand and its neighbors.2 Calculated using IPCC tier-1 emission factor embedded in LEAP financial burden of the power sector and promote competition.

        <p>Energy and climate policy modeling is receiving increasing attention in the ASEAN region. Huber et al. [24] employ the URBS-ASEAN linear optimization model to simulate capacity and hourly dispatch of generation, transmission, and storage. The study involves a scenario for lowering the carbon intensity of the ASEAN power sector starting from a base level of 250 g/kwh to 0 g/kwh and indicates the technology mix and cost for each carbon intensity level. Despite its early consideration of zero-emission, even before the signing of the Paris Agreement, the study only simulates one year, i.e., 2050, and lacks analysis of the pathways towards 2050. Thus, the trajectory of technological change to achieve zero emissions by 2050 remains unexplored. The most recent modeling study is the 6th ASEAN Energy Outlook, which provides four scenarios for the ASEAN power sector until 2040 [11]. That study uses the LEAP accounting framework to analyze the four ASEAN pathways in terms of power capacity, electricity generation, and GHG emissions. The first scenario is a baseline scenario, and the three other scenarios are alternative scenarios, following national, regional, and global climate policy trajectories. However, a scenario for a net-zero emissions pathway of the ASEAN power sector was not included in the study. Moreover, the study lacks an analysis of the cost of capacity expansion, which is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of different capacity expansion pathways. Other studies focus on one or a few ASEAN power systems. Handayani et al. [10] assess the plausible trade-offs between the objectives of electrification and climate change mitigation in the context of the Indonesian power sector. The study utilizes LEAP to investigate the implications of those objectives for costs, technology deployment, and GHG emissions across several scenarios. Misila et al. [27] also employ LEAP to examine the potential for reducing GHG emissions by utilizing renewable energy and increasing energy efficiency from 2015 to 2050. The findings include the potential for domestic renewable energy and energy efficiency measures to contribute to Thailand's NDC. Nong et al. [28] employ the GTAP-E-Power model to examine the impact on the Vietnamese economy of additional taxes on coal and petroleum which were proposed as a part of the Vietnamese climate policy strategy. The results indicate that a higher fossil fuel tax would foster the expansion of renewable energy. On the other hand, it would also cause a decline in Vietnam's GDP. Haiges et al [29] evaluate the Malaysian 2050 power sector pathway, following a set of three technology-based scenarios. The paper uses The Integrated Market Allocation-Energy Flow Optimisation Model System (TIMES) to analyze electricity demand, capacity, electricity generation, costs, and CO 2 emissions. Mondal et al. [30] also employ TIMES to assess low-carbon strategies for the Philippines' power sector from 2014 to 2040. The strategies are covered in four scenarios: carbon tax, renewable energy target, reduction of coal, and subsidy for renewables. Meanwhile, Maliq [31] investigates the potential of renewable energy sources to meet the power demand for water heating in Brunei using Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources software.Energy and climate policy modeling is receiving increasing attention in the ASEAN region.

        <p>All the studies mentioned above address energy and climate change policies in various contexts within ASEAN and assess their implications for the power sector using modeling software. While these studies show how climate policy drives the transition to a low-carbon power sector, none has included a long-term analysis of a net-zero pathway scenario. Moreover, the three studies that used LEAP have not utilized the Next Energy Modelling System for Optimization (NEMO), which was recently added to LEAP to enable simulations of storage capacity. Therefore, a study on the ASEAN pathway to net-zero emissions utilizing LEAP with the NEMO optimization framework can contribute to the development of modeling methodology, a better understanding of the innovations required to achieve the 1.5 • C Paris Agreement target as well as improved understanding of the outlook and exigencies of one of the world's fastest-growing power sectors.All the studies mentioned above address energy and climate change policies in various contexts within ASEAN and assess their implications for the power sector using modeling software.

        <p>LEAP is equipped with the essential features needed for this study. Firstly, LEAP's "scenario manager" permits simulations of several pathways for expanding the power system based on different assumptions. Secondly, LEAP can run both accounting and least-cost optimization modeling of power system expansion, giving the flexibility to use different approaches to model the set scenarios. Finally, LEAP modeling outputs include features required for this study, among others capacity mix, electricity generation mix, total costs, and GHG emissions.LEAP is equipped with the essential features needed for this study.

        <p>One shortcoming of LEAP is that it does not account for transmission and distribution infrastructure expansion. As a result, the power system expansion simulation in this article assumes that electricity can be transmitted to any load station at any time and neglects transmission and distribution network constraints.

        <p>The LEAP methodology for the ASEAN power sector is illustrated in Fig. 2. Input Parameters include electricity demand, technical, economic, and environmental parameters, and a set of constraints. Electricity supply simulations are carried out for the three scenarios, utilizing the accounting framework for the REF scenario and the optimization framework for the RET and NZE scenarios. The electricity supply simulation should satisfy the projected electricity demand for each year, taking into account energy resource availability, especially for renewable energy. We run LEAP simulations for each ASEAN country and consolidate the results at the regional level. Due to data and methodological limitations for simulating the grid interconnection between countries, it is assumed that, aside from the existing and committed capacity for electricity import and export, there will be no additional power exchange between ASEAN countries.The LEAP methodology for the ASEAN power sector is illustrated in Fig. 2.

        <p>The demand for electricity in this study is calculated using the demand growth projections stipulated in existing studies. Thus, the electricity demand in a given year is the sum of the previous year's demand plus the anticipated growth (Eq. ( 1)).

        <p>LEAP simulates the three scenarios based on various input parameters. The accounting setting simulates the power system expansion needed to meet the future electricity demand, regardless of costs. We use this setting when modeling the reference scenario, which simulates the continuation of the base year's power generation mix without least-cost consideration. On the other hand, the optimization setting enables the construction of least-cost capacity expansion models and electricity dispatch in a power system under various constraints. We utilize this setting for simulating alternative scenarios, while constraining the simulation with, among others, a minimum share of renewable electricity being targeted by each ASEAN country.LEAP simulates the three scenarios based on various input parameters.

        <p>When using the optimization setting in LEAP, the optimal solution is defined as the power system with the lowest total net present value of all costs over the whole computation period, from the base year to the end year (Eq. ( 4)). This setting operates through integration with an optimization framework, which relies on a solver software tool for developing decision optimization models. Handayani et al. [32] describe detailed descriptions of LEAP. This study extends the work of Handayani et al. [32] by incorporating NEMO, an open-source, high-performance energy system optimization program that was recently added to LEAP. 
            <rs type="software">NEMO</rs> simulates an energy system with perfect foresight using least-cost optimization. This essentially means that it strives to meet electricity demand over time at the lowest possible cost. Cost minimization is performed concurrently for all modeled time periods, and all costs are discounted to the start of the simulation [33]. Costs can include investment costs, fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs, and fuel costs (see Eq. ( 4)). where TC is the total cost, N t denotes the total years from 2021 through to 2050, p is the power generation technology, d is the discount rate, Cc is the initial capital cost, Ca t is the capacity in year t, foc t is the fixed operation and maintenance costs in year t, Voc t is the variable operation and maintenance costs in year t, P t is the output power in year t, and Fc t is the fuel cost in year t. NEMO is a high-performance, open-source modeling tool for energy system optimization developed in the Julia programming language. The key features of NEMO that are relevant for this study include the leastcost optimization of energy supply and demand; its ability to model renewable energy targets, and most importantly, its capability to simulate energy storage while taking variable renewable energy operation profiles into account. Thus, it enables robust climate change planning and an analysis of the role of energy storage [33].

        <p>The energy storage simulation is based upon the daily patterns of electricity demand in each country versus the maximum availability of each power generation technology. The maximum availability of a generation technology is the ratio of the maximum energy produced to what would have been produced if the process ran at full capacity for a given period (expressed as a percentage). Therefore, for a robust simulation of the needed storage capacity in our model, we use a demand load curve to represent the daily demand pattern, which was derived from the historical average daily load with monthly variations, consisting of 288-time slices of a year, as shown in Appendix A. On the supply side, the maximum availability of solar PV is represented by an availability curve that shows the daily variations of solar PV's availability per month, which was derived from historical data [34].The energy storage simulation is based upon the daily patterns of electricity demand in each country versus the maximum availability of each power generation technology.

        <p>ASEAN electricity demand is projected to reach 3,323 TWh by 2050, more than threefold the electricity demand in 2020 (Fig. 3a). ASEAN electricity consumption goes 3,948 kWh/capita by 2050. Combined, Indonesia and Vietnam have 58% of the total ASEAN electricity demand in 2050 while Cambodia and the Philippines see the highest and secondhighest electricity demand growth, respectively. Accordingly, our simulation using LEAP estimates total electricity generation of 3,715 TWh across the ASEAN countries will be required to satisfy the demand in 2050 (Fig. 3b). Thus, ASEAN electricity generation represents 7% of the global electricity generation projected by the IEA [57].

        <p>The LEAP optimization simulations include 14 power generation and two energy storage technologies for ASEAN power sector expansion technology candidates. Existing renewable technologies such as hydro and biomass are favorable in terms of costs compared to other renewable technologies. However, their potentials are limited, needing additional capacity of variable renewables, which are still undermined in the base year's technology mix. Variable renewable energy, especially solar, plays a significant role in the future ASEAN power sector, owing to its vast technical potential. Furthermore, solar PV has the fastest learning rate among other renewable technologies. Thus, solar PV is the only viable option after all other renewable potentials have been utilized. Energy storage technologies are primarily deployed to balance the variable renewable energy while the role of nuclear remains negligible for the ASEAN countries. Energy storage is less crucial in countries with a high share of hydropower such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Myanmar. Meanwhile, hydro pumped storage comes to play a role in Indonesia and Vietnam, which have been identified as having the greatest potential for this form of energy storage. These results indicate that deploying variable renewable energy in combination with energy storage is more financially attractive than deploying nuclear, which has a negative learning rate and uncertain construction period [58]. Nuclear only appears in Singapore's future technology mix due to the country's shortage of renewable energy potentials. However, Singapore could also opt to import clean energy from its neighboring countries.

        <p>Since the potential for hydro pumped storage is limited, battery storage is expected to play a critical role. Nevertheless, to date, Li-ion batteries are still expensive despite notable cost declines in recent years. Furthermore, Li-on is not recommended for long-term storage because the charge they hold dissipates over time [50]. Thus, technological learning curves for battery storage are keys for the long-term energy transition. Furthermore, hydro pumped storage potentials in countries other than Indonesia and Vietnam need to be explored considering the critical role of energy storage in the transition to the netzero ASEAN power sector.Since the potential for hydro pumped storage is limited, battery storage is expected to play a critical role.

        <p>Another interesting finding of our simulations is the absence of GHG removal technology, i.e., CCS, for meeting the NZE target, despite allowing them in the simulation starting from 2035. Aside from being expensive, neither coal CCS nor NGCCS can eliminate all GHG emissions, necessitating negative emission technology such as BECCS to supplement them. Yet, the deployment of BECCS is constrained by the limited bioenergy potential in ASEAN member states. Our analysis shows that only Indonesia has a sufficient bioenergy potential for the deployment of BECSS to offset residual emissions from NGCCS. Yet, our simulation for Indonesia shows that deploying NGCCS in combination with BECCS entails higher costs than simply exploiting the renewable energy potential.Another interesting finding of our simulations is the absence of GHG removal technology, i.e., CCS, for meeting the NZE target, despite allowing them in the simulation starting from 2035.

        <p>The LEAP modeling results indicate that the ASEAN power sector can reach net-zero solely by exploiting the region's abundant renewable energy potentials and nuclear, without needing carbon offset from other sectors.The LEAP modeling results indicate that the ASEAN power sector can reach net-zero solely by exploiting the region's abundant renewable energy potentials and nuclear, without needing carbon offset from other sectors.</p>
        <p>We compare the total costs of capacity expansion for the three scenarios in Fig. 10. The total costs accounted for 633, 767, and 910 billion USD, respectively, under REF, RET, and NZE scenarios. It is worth noting that in Indonesia and Singapore, the RET scenario yields lower total costs compared to the REF scenario (see Appendix G). This indicates that the shift to a low-carbon power system is not only driven by the Paris Agreement. Instead, it is a realistic option given the declining cost of renewable energy technologies, which renders them more competitive in the long run compared to fossil fuels. It is worth mentioning that the costs of early retirement of fossil fuel-based power plants have not been included in the cost estimates due to methodological limitations. Thus, the total costs of the NZE scenario would have been higher if these costs were included.We compare the total costs of capacity expansion for the three scenarios in Fig. 10.

        <p>Table 5 illustrates the GHG mitigation costs in RET and NZE scenarios. The mitigation costs are the difference between total costs in each alternative scenario compared to the reference scenario. The RET scenario and the NZE scenario require 134 billion USD and 277 billion USD incremental costs, respectively. We further calculated the costeffectiveness of GHG mitigation in the two alternative scenarios by dividing the GHG mitigation costs by the cumulative GHG reduction throughout 2021-2050. The results indicate the cost-effectiveness of GHG reductions of 16 USD/ton CO 2 e in the RET scenario and 12 USD/ ton CO 2 e in the NZE scenario. These values can be used as indications when determining the carbon price in ASEAN.Table 5 illustrates the GHG mitigation costs in RET and NZE scenarios.

        <p>As one of the world's fastest-growing economic blocs, ASEAN contributes to increasing global GHG emissions while it is also more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than most parts of the world. The primary goal of this article has been to assess the pathway of the ASEAN power sector toward net-zero emissions by 2050. This is the first study to analyze an ASEAN power sector's net-zero pathway to the best of our knowledge. On the methodological side, this study adds to the existing LEAP-based literature by employing the NEMO optimization framework. This enables endogenous energy storage capacity addition needed for variable renewable energy integration into the grid. We used a unique dataset on the power systems and resources of the ASEAN member states and carried out LEAP simulations for three scenarios for the period from 2021 to 2050. The reference scenario (REF) assumes continuing the base year's technology portfolio (business as usual) throughout the study period. The renewable energy target scenario (RET) analyzes the power system expansion to meet renewable energy policy targets of the ASEAN member states. Finally, the net-zero emissions scenario (NZE) assesses the power system expansion pathway beyond both the business as usual trajectory and the current policy targets.As one of the world's fastest-growing economic blocs, ASEAN contributes to increasing global GHG emissions while it is also more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than most parts of the world.

        <p>The LEAP simulation for the net-zero pathway of the ASEAN power sector produced several findings. Firstly, the ASEAN power sector can reach net-zero emissions in 2050 by utilizing its abundant renewable energy potential. From a technological standpoint, solar PV plays a critical role in reaching the ASEAN net-zero emissions as it is the only viable option after all other renewable energy potentials have been utilized. Likewise, energy storage deployment becomes a necessity to balance the high penetration of variable renewable energy. Secondly, GHG emissions should peak before 2030 if net-zero emissions are to be realized by 2050. In that case, no construction of new fossil fuel-based power plants can be allowed starting from 2021 onwards. Finally, the NZE pathway entails higher total costs compared to RET, let alone to REF. However, the GHG abatement cost per ton of CO 2 e under NZE is lower than that under RET. It is also worth noting that this does not take into account the climate change externalities in the form of the costs that will be brought by climate change, which will be particularly high for the ASEAN countries.The LEAP simulation for the net-zero pathway of the ASEAN power sector produced several findings.

        <p>Concerning new technology, nuclear was found to be uneconomical and only adopted in Singapore due to the country's lack of renewable energy sources. However, Singapore could instead import electricity from the other ASEAN member states or hydrogen from more remote countries like Australia, which has published a vision for commercial renewable hydrogen by 2030 and set the target for hydrogen production at below $2 per kilogram [59]. CCS technology was also found to be uneconomical. Hence it does not appear in the technology mix although it was competed with other technologies in the LEAP simulation starting from 2035. Another concern with CCS is that it cannot eliminate all GHG emissions, necessitating carbon offsets from negative emission technologies such as BECCS or carbon offsets from other sectors. The former requires a significant amount of bioenergy-with knock-on effects for biodiversity and food supply-whereas the latter adds the cost of purchasing carbon credits.Concerning new technology, nuclear was found to be uneconomical and only adopted in Singapore due to the country's lack of renewable energy sources.

        <p>Given the critical role of energy storage for the transition to net-zero, ASEAN should accelerate the adoption of energy storage to take benefit from technological learning. As a starting point, ASEAN could enhance studies on hydro pumped storage potentials in the region. Moreover, it could also take the lead in the research and development of energy storage considering the abundant potential of variable renewable energy resources. Indonesia has started by establishing Indonesia Battery Corporation, which can be emulated in other ASEAN countries. On the other hand, Vietnam has demonstrated leadership in the deployment of solar PV, reaching 16,5 GW by the end of 2020. Furthermore, the country's most recent draft PDP includes massive variable renewable energy development, resulting in the country having the highest share of nonhydro renewable energy in its national electricity mix among other ASEAN member states by 2030.Given the critical role of energy storage for the transition to net-zero, ASEAN should accelerate the adoption of energy storage to take benefit from technological learning.

        <p>Despite its important findings, this study has some limitations. First, the electricity demand projections in this study do not include the target/assumptions about the electrification of other sectors, which could have a significant impact on our analysis. This is an area for future research to analyze various demand scenarios, including the penetration rate of electric vehicles and the increased rate of industrial electrification.Despite its important findings, this study has some limitations.
