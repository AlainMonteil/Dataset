        <p>Whatever the light spectrum, the kinetic rate constants for both myclobutanil degradation and TOC conversion exhibited a volcano-like profile with increasing the narrow band-gap (2.1 eV) LaFeO3 content, the optimum composite strongly overperforming both single phases, with full myclobutanil mineralization achieved in 240 min in the best case. The light spectrum influenced the optimum LaFeO3 content in the composite, being observed at 5 wt.% and 12.5 wt.% under solar and visible light, respectively. This has been attributed to the existence of different light-mediated reaction mechanisms. The optimum LaFeO3/TiO2 composite photocatalyst was active and stable after several runs under solar light with leached iron concentration below 0.1 mg/L in solution.Whatever the light spectrum, the kinetic rate constants for both myclobutanil degradation and TOC conversion exhibited a volcano-like profile with increasing the narrow band-gap (2.1 eV) LaFeO3 content, the optimum composite strongly overperforming both single phases, with full myclobutanil mineralization achieved in 240 min in the best case.

        <p>Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) emerged as feasible alternatives or complements to conventional water treatment processes for treating refractory compounds such as notably the pesticides, that can provoke ecological risks or adverse effects on living organisms even at low concentrations [1][2][3]. Among them, photocatalysis has gained important attention due to a high efficiency and relatively low costs, when working with low pollutant charges, as well as to its ability to achieve complete mineralization of biorecalcitrant and emerging contaminants in an extended pH range, thanks to its ability to oxidize the short-chain acids [3][4][5].Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) emerged as feasible alternatives or complements to conventional water treatment processes for treating refractory compounds such as notably the pesticides, that can provoke ecological risks or adverse effects on living organisms even at low concentrations [1][2][3].

        <p>However, it requires the use of ultraviolet-A (UV-A) as activation light source, as a result of its wide band-gap value (~3.2 eV). One approach for overcoming this issue consists in the elaboration of TiO2based heterojunction photocatalysts through the coupling of TiO2 with another semiconductor of narrower band-gap used as visible light photosensitizer [6][7][8]. Further, building heterojunctions is a strategy for enhancing the activity under solar light by favoring inter-semiconductor charge transfer that allows a lowering of charge recombination [9][10][11]. Many works investigated on the coupling of TiO2 with semiconductors such as e.g. oxide, sulfide or, more recently, carbon nitride for degrading organic pollutants in water under visible or solar light [12,13]. WO3 [14], Fe2O3 [15][16][17], Bi2O3 and ferrites are among the most popular metal oxides associated within binary heterojunctions [17,18].However, it requires the use of ultraviolet-A (UV-A) as activation light source, as a result of its wide band-gap value (~3.2 eV).

        <p>In this frame, ferrite semiconductor materials have recently received a special attention for use in photocatalysis because of the ability of most of them to absorb and use a part of visible light for performing surface redox reactions, due to band gaps of ca. 2 eV (wavelengths lower than 620 nm) [13]. Further, most of them display band energy positions suitable for oxidizing water and reducing dioxygen. Beside a high stability, they also benefit from a large composition versatility that allows their physico-chemical properties to be tuned via adequate synthetic strategies, such as e.g. the band-gap energy, the n/p-type character or the properties of lattice oxygen vacancies, whose controlled formation was reported to inhibit the charge recombination in the perovskite structures [19][20][21][22][23].In this frame, ferrite semiconductor materials have recently received a special attention for use in photocatalysis because of the ability of most of them to absorb and use a part of visible light for performing surface redox reactions, due to band gaps of ca. 2 eV (wavelengths lower than 620 nm) [13].

        <p>Among the ABO3 perovskite type oxides, lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO3) is an interesting p-type semiconductor with a band-gap of ca. 2.1 eV, and the ability to absorb a part of the visible light from the solar spectra [24][25][26][27]. However, when used as heterogeneous catalyst, LaFeO3 displays a relatively low activity [25,26,[28][29][30], mainly due to poor intrinsic charge transport in the bulk and high charge recombination rates, so that following a semiconductor heterojunction strategy is a valuable approach.Among the ABO3 perovskite type oxides, lanthanum ferrite (LaFeO3) is an interesting p-type semiconductor with a band-gap of ca. 2.1 eV, and the ability to absorb a part of the visible light from the solar spectra [24][25][26][27].

        <p>The LaFeO3-based heterojunctions are however not the most studied ones so far. In most of the studies, LaFeO3 was associated with narrow band gap semiconductors such as g-C3N4 [31][32][33], and to a lesser extent e.g. SnS2 [34] , AgBr [35], CdS [36], Ag2CO3 [37] or ZnIn2S4 [38], or the ternary oxide Bi3NbO7 [39], for water treatment or H2 production under visible light. In most of the cases, a Z-scheme mechanism was proposed, implying the interfacial recombination of the conduction band electrons or of the valence band holes of the ferrite with their counterparts in the second semiconductor, depending on the relative band positions. Scarce works focused on the building of p-n heterojunctions between LaFeO3 and wide band gap semiconductors, e.g. ZnO [40] and TiO2 [41][42][43][44]. Regardless of the coupled semiconductor, a two-step synthesis approach was mostly followed for synthesizing LaFeO3based composites, the associated semiconductor material being synthesized in presence of sol-gel LaFeO3 grains. The reverse synthetic strategy was rarely reported, since obtaining good crystallization rates for LaFeO3 requires a high-temperature oxidative treatment that most of the associated phases cannot withstand [32,39]. Heterojunction composites were also scarcely prepared by mechanical or ultrasonic treatment of crystallized powders in suspension with final temperature treatment [33].The LaFeO3-based heterojunctions are however not the most studied ones so far.

In a typical reaction procedure, 100 mg of catalyst was dispersed under stirring in a 100 mL aqueous solution of myclobutanil at 20 mg/L concentration, corresponding to an initial organic carbon concentration of 18 mg/L and to a catalyst load of 1.0 g/L. Prior to irradiation, the catalyst suspension had been stirred for 1 h in the dark to ensure the establishment of the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. The experiments were carried out within a Suntest XLS+ reaction chamber (Atlas Material Testing Technology BV, Gelnhausen, Germany) equipped with a Xenon arc lamp of 1700 W adjustable power and a Solar ID65 filter to limit the UV radiation at 320 nm for simulating solar exposition according to ICH Q1B guidelines.

        <p>Further, no diffraction peak shift was observed for the composites, suggesting that neither insertion of Ti atoms in the LFO unit cell nor that of La or Fe atoms in the anatase crystal occurred, as expected from the soft synthesis method and the low temperature of the final calcination step compared to the that used for stabilizing the LFO. In a first approximation, the mean size of the anatase crystallites was globally increasing from 13 nm to 21-25 nm with the increase in the LFO content, the general trend being that the formation of smaller anatase crystallites was favoured at low ferrite contents.Further, no diffraction peak shift was observed for the composites, suggesting that neither insertion of Ti atoms in the LFO unit cell nor that of La or Fe atoms in the anatase crystal occurred, as expected from the soft synthesis method and the low temperature of the final calcination step compared to the that used for stabilizing the LFO.

        <p>Figure 2 shows SEM images of the heterojunction materials and of both titania and LFO reference materials. The images recorded in both secondary and back-scattered electron modes evidenced that synthesising TiO2 in the presence of the LFO phase did not influence the overall granular morphology of the titania phase. Mapping analysis showed the distribution of the LFO phase in the composite materials while, considering the accuracy of the measurement, EDX analysis corroborated the equimolar La:Fe ratio within the composites, as well as a homogeneous and parallel distribution of titania and ferrite phases, with a minor formation of ferrite-rich regions. respectively. For the composites, in addition to the clear edge corresponding to the titania phase, a second absorption edge with low intensity assigned to the ferrite phase was observed in the spectra recorded on the samples with a low ferrite content, that was more pronounced as the LFO content increased and could be clearly evidenced for both 12.5-and 25.0-LFO/TiO2 samples. The band gap values estimated from the Tauc plots (Fig. S3) for an indirect transition in TiO2 and a direct one in LaFeO3 [53] are shown in Table 1. The band gap of the ferrite phase was not influenced by the presence of the anatase phase, and was calculated at ca. 2.10 eV for spectra with a clear absorption edge.Figure 2 shows SEM images of the heterojunction materials and of both titania and LFO reference materials.

        <p>Similarly, taking into account the moderate accuracy of the graphical method due to the difficulty of estimating the low-energy region baseline because of the simultaneous ferrite absorption, the band gap of the TiO2 phase remained unchanged, being centered around that of the reference TiO2 within the 3.14-3.26 eV range. Figure S4 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the composite materials and of both single phase references, which are characterized by a IV-type, with a H3-type hysteresis, characteristic of aggregates or agglomerates of particles forming slit shaped pores with non-uniform size and/or shape. The reference LFO has a low specific surface area of 8 m 2 /g, that increased notably up to the 14-77 m 2 /g values for the composite materials, so that the composite photocatalysts globally possess a higher surface area than both single phase counterparts (Table 1). This suggests that the LFO/TiO2 materials differ strongly from a mechanical mixing of segregated phases and can consequently be considered as (nano)composite materials providing good inter-phase contacts. In particular, the highest specific surface areas (at 66 m 2 /g and 77 m 2 /g) with the highest pore volumes, were obtained for the 2.5-and 5.0-LFO/TiO2 samples, respectively, in agreement with the smallest mean crystallite size of 13 nm of the main anatase phase. This might directly result from the interaction of the titanium precursor with the LFO crystallites during the sol-gel synthesis. Further, the presence of interconnected phases can consequently contribute to the enhanced surface area and pore volume properties. A similar increase in surface area was already observed for LFO-based composites compared to both single phase materials, for instance in the case of heterojunctions obtained by synthesizing CdS nanorods [36] and g-C3N4 [31] in the presence of crystallized LFO. Also, Mrotek et al. prepared a coreshell structured sol-gel TiO2-based composite with an enhanced surface area in comparison to that of ZnFe2O4/SiO2 used as core material [54]. Fluorescence lifetime measurements under UV excitation (Fig. 3A) show, for TiO2, a decay curve that can be fitted to a monoexponential function with a lifetime of ca. 1.05 ns, while LFO data (not shown) are better described as a biexponential decay with considerably longer lifetime (1.96 ns).Similarly, taking into account the moderate accuracy of the graphical method due to the difficulty of estimating the low-energy region baseline because of the simultaneous ferrite absorption, the band gap of the TiO2 phase remained unchanged, being centered around that of the reference TiO2 within the 3.14-3.26 eV range.

        <p>Composite catalysts give rise, in all cases, to decay data fitting monoexponential curves with lifetimes between ca. 1.1 and 1.3 ns, suggesting that the fluorescence of titania is mainly observed above that of the ferrite. The comparison of the composites with TiO2 shows, as a general trend, an enlargement in this fluorescence lifetime when both phases coexist, indicating an increased population in the conduction band of titania and therefore suggesting an electron transfer from the excited ferrite phase to the TiO2 one, in accordance to the previously described relative band positions between both semiconductors [44]. By contrast, the fluorescence lifetimes under visible light excitation (Fig. 3B), corresponding only to the excitation of the ferrite phase [55], are shorter in all composites compared to that observed for the pure ferrite, indicating a decreased population of electrons in the conduction band in this phase. These observations therefore suggest that a type-II heterojunction [6,44,56,57] is established between both components, as described in Figure S5 in Supplementary Material. XPS surface investigation has been performed for selected LFO/TiO2 composites as well as for both sol-gel TiO2 and LFO single phase references, and Figure 4 and Figure S6 show the XPS spectra profiles for the different core orbitals. They evidence that the pure LFO phase was characterized by the presence of La 3+ and Fe 3+ ions at the surface [55,58]. Indeed, the La 3d5/2 -La 3d3/2 orbital doublet contribution at 833.6 eV and 850.3 eV (spin orbit splitting of 16.7 eV [59][60][61] and multiplet splitting of 3.8 eV [62]) is characteristic of La 3+ species (Fig. 4C), while the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 orbital doublet contribution at 710.5 eV and 723.9 eV, with a 13.4 eV spin orbit coupling [59,62] a the low intensity and broad shake-up satellite peak at about 718 eV, is characteristic of Fe 3+ ions [63,64] (Fig. 4D). The LFO surface is also characterized by the broad multi-contribution envelope of the O 1s core orbital spectra, in agreement with the literature [65], and with a main contribution at 528.8 eV assigned to lattice oxygen species [66,67]. Regarding the TiO2 reference, the Ti 2p spectra shows the usual doublet related to the Ti 2p3/2-Ti 2p1/2 spin-orbit components of octahedral symmetry Ti 4+ (Ti-O) in a typical TiO2 crystalline structure, at 458.6 eV and 464.3 eV respectively, with no contribution attributed to Ti 3+ species, indicating the presence of few surface defects [68][69][70]. Also the O 1s spectra envelope exhibits a main contribution at 529.8 eV, usually attributed to O 2-species in O-Ti bonds of the TiO2 lattice.Composite catalysts give rise, in all cases, to decay data fitting monoexponential curves with lifetimes between ca. 1.1 and 1.3 ns, suggesting that the fluorescence of titania is mainly observed above that of the ferrite.

        <p>As far as the LFO/TiO2 catalysts are concerned, it is worth noting that the presence of both La 3+ and Fe 3+ cations is not evidenced at the surface of the different composites, whatever the wt.% content of the LFO phase in the materials. By contrast, both Ti 2p and O 1s core orbital spectra are characteristic of the TiO2 phase, with binding energies being similar to those recorded for the pure sol-gel TiO2 material, ie. at 458.6 ± 0.2 eV and 529.8 ± 0.2 eV for Ti 2p3/2-Ti 2p1/2 and O 1s orbital peaks, respectively.As far as the LFO/TiO2 catalysts are concerned, it is worth noting that the presence of both La 3+ and Fe 3+ cations is not evidenced at the surface of the different composites, whatever the wt.% content of the LFO phase in the materials.

        <p>While the absence of any signal assigned to the LFO phase for composites with a low LFO content could directly result from this low content, this explanation has to be ruled out for composites containing higher LFO loadings, and we suggest that the LFO phase is fully covered by a TiO2 layer in the different composite photocatalysts whatever the LFO wt.% content. titanium isopropoxide or n-butoxide as precursor in the presence of a host semiconductor phase.While the absence of any signal assigned to the LFO phase for composites with a low LFO content could directly result from this low content, this explanation has to be ruled out for composites containing higher LFO loadings, and we suggest that the LFO phase is fully covered by a TiO2 layer in the different composite photocatalysts whatever the LFO wt.% content. titanium isopropoxide or n-butoxide as precursor in the presence of a host semiconductor phase.</p>
        <p>Through the hydrolysis of butoxide, Li et al. synthesized nanocrystalline and nanoporous sol-gel TiO2 shells surrounding microcrystalline (Ba,Sr)TiO3 cores, while Mrotek et al. prepared ZnFe2O4/SiO2/TiO2 photocatalyst [54,71]. Using titanium isopropoxide, Fe2O3@TiO2 core-shell nanostructures were obtained [72], and Abdel-Wahed et al. recently elaborated a MnFe2O4@rGO@TiO2 photocatalyst with core double-shell structure by performing the sol-gel synthesis in the presence of a pre-structured core-shell MnFe2O4@rGO host [73]. TEM images shown in Figure 5 are in agreement with the existence of a core-shell structure for the LFO/TiO2 composite photocatalysts. Indeed, Figure 5A shows a LFO crystallite with an interplanar spacing of 0.39 nm consistent with the (110) planes characteristic of the LFO structural crystallographic features, surrounded by a dense and (meso)porous network of anatase TiO2 crystallites with the characteristic interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm corresponding to the (101) planes.

        <p>We cannot rule out that the formation of self-standing TiO2 particles is occurring in some extent in parallel to the coating of LFO grains with a TiO2 poly-crystallite shell, and all the more pronounced as the LFO content is lower. Indeed, because of the highly electrophilic nature of titanium centers in titanium alkoxides, they can easily react with nucleophiles like water and are very sensitive to moisture. This consequently leads to fast and homogeneous nucleation resulting in the aggregation of cores, due to the energy change in the system [74]. 2 reports the corresponding rate constants for both myclobutanil degradation and TOC conversion using a pseudo first and zero order kinetic model, respectively, as typical in a photocatalytic process. First, no detectable degradation of myclobutanil has been observed at room temperature after 240 min under solar light, indicating that the substrate photolysis can be neglected in the experimental conditions (not shown).We cannot rule out that the formation of self-standing TiO2 particles is occurring in some extent in parallel to the coating of LFO grains with a TiO2 poly-crystallite shell, and all the more pronounced as the LFO content is lower.

        <p>The results evidence that the single phase photocatalysts and the LFO/TiO2 composites are active in the degradation and mineralization of myclobutanil regardless the wt.% content of LFO. The most active composite photocatalyst allowed full removal of myclobutanil to be achieved within 180 min of test, while only 85% of myclobutanil abatement was obtained with pure LFO and TiO2 photocatalysts after 240 min of test. As far as TOC conversion is concerned, complete myclobutanil mineralization was obtained on the most active composite for 240 min of test, while only 77% and 55% of mineralization yield was achieved with the LFO and TiO2 photocatalysts, respectively. Thus, the coupling of both semiconductor oxides enhanced strongly the activity of the photocatalysts under solar light when compared to that of both single phase materials, with the existence of an optimum in performance and in conversion rates for a composite containing 5 wt.% of ferrite. Fig. 6C depicts the volcano-like profile of the influence of the LFO wt.% content in the composite on the kinetic rate constant for the myclobutanil removal and the TOC conversion. In all cases, the constant values of the composites are higher than a linear combination of the values obtained with the pure phases considering the mass percentage of each component, revealing a synergistic effect between phases. The highest apparent rate constants of 0.018 min -1 and 0.071 mg/Lmin, respectively, are obtained for the 5.0-LFO/TiO2 photocatalyst, in both cases higher than those achieved on the LFO and TiO2 counterparts (Table 2). It is worth noting that optimum LFO contents within the 1-5 wt.% range have been mostly reported [31,32,37,38,42], although it obviously strongly depends on both the nature and the synthesis strategy of the LFO-based heterojunctions as well as on the light source.The results evidence that the single phase photocatalysts and the LFO/TiO2 composites are active in the degradation and mineralization of myclobutanil regardless the wt.% content of LFO.

        <p>We suggest that the crystallite size is not to be the predominant factor in the enhancement of the activity for the LFO/TiO2 composites compared to both single phases. Indeed, the most active 5-LFO/TiO2 composite has indeed the smallest mean anatase TiO2 crystallite size at 13 nm, but a far lower kinetic rate constant for myclobutanil degradation was obtained on the 2.5-LFO/TiO2 composite with a similar mean anatase size.

        <p>The composite photocatalysts were also evaluated in terms of lanthanum and iron leached to the solution for 240 min. While no presence of La was detected in the treated aqueous effluents, a low final released iron concentration of 0.1 mg/L was observed for the most active photocatalyst, ie. 5-LFO/TiO2 composite, while the pristine LFO photocatalyst released iron with a final concentration of 0.7 mg/L (Table 2). The formation of surface complexes between surface iron and carboxylic acids has been proposed to be one of the main mechanisms involved in the release of Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ species from iron-based catalysts in AOP processes [75,76]. They photodegrade with the simultaneous release of free iron cations (Eq. 2). Consequently, if released in substantial amount, iron might contribute to the overall activity after its subsequent complexation by short-chain organic acids (mainly oxalic, acetic and formic acids), through a photo-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer mechanism occurring in Fe polycarboxylates in homogeneous phase, with the simultaneous production of active oxygenated radicals [77][78][79]. According to this direct solar light activated mechanism, oxalate was reported to be one of the most active ligands.The composite photocatalysts were also evaluated in terms of lanthanum and iron leached to the solution for 240 min.

        <p>The volcano-like profile of the influence of the LFO content in the composite on both kinetic rate constants is shown in Fig. 7C. By contrast to the reactions under solar light, both volcano-like patterns are centered on a composite with a higher LFO content, ie. 12.5 wt.% vs. 5 wt.% under solar light, with the highest rate constant for myclobutanil degradation and TOC degradation of 0.0016 min -1 and 0.0059 mg/Lmin, respectively. Dhinesh et al. also reported an enhancement of the activity of LFO/TiO2 composites under visible light compared to pure LFO, using the degradation of methyl orange dye as test reaction, but in a lesser extent, probably due to a too high content of LFO in the composite photocatalyst (ie. a 1:1 wt. ratio) [43]. However, no kinetic rate constants were calculated for quantifying this improvement, and the dye mineralization was not evidenced by any TOC concentration evolution curve.The volcano-like profile of the influence of the LFO content in the composite on both kinetic rate constants is shown in Fig. 7C.

        <p>Both the lower myclobutanil abatement and the lower myclobutanil mineralization yield achieved after 240 min of test under pure visible evidenced the far smaller activity of the composite photocatalysts when compared to the reactions performed under solar light, as materialized by kinetic rate constants being lower by about one order of magnitude (Table 3). This suggests in a first approximation that the activity resulting directly from the activation of the composites by visible light (ie. through the LFO phase) does not contribute significantly to the overall activity of the composites under solar light.Both the lower myclobutanil abatement and the lower myclobutanil mineralization yield achieved after 240 min of test under pure visible evidenced the far smaller activity of the composite photocatalysts when compared to the reactions performed under solar light, as materialized by kinetic rate constants being lower by about one order of magnitude (Table 3).

        <p>No leaching of lanthanum to the water occurred during the tests regardless of the photocatalyst composition, while the amounts of iron released from the LFO-based photocatalysts under visible light were substantially lower than those measured under solar light, with a negligible final released iron concentration of 0.02 mg/L for the most active photocatalyst (Table 3). This is attributed to the lower mineralization yield achieved under pure visible light, that unfavours and prevents the surface complexation-induced release of Fe to the solution (Eq. 2), due to the presence of carboxylic acids in a far lower extent. The shift of the optimum content of the visible-light activated LFO within the composite when replacing the incident solar light by pure visible light suggests that the light-mediated reaction mechanism depends on the activation light spectrum. Thus, based on photocatalytic activity and fluorescence lifetime observations, different reaction mechanisms are proposed as follows:No leaching of lanthanum to the water occurred during the tests regardless of the photocatalyst composition, while the amounts of iron released from the LFO-based photocatalysts under visible light were substantially lower than those measured under solar light, with a negligible final released iron concentration of 0.02 mg/L for the most active photocatalyst (Table 3).

        <p>A. Under solar light, the presence of the narrow band gap LFO in the composite allows the composite to be activated not only through the UV-A part of the spectra, but also via a fraction of its visible region, therefore allowing the extension of the light absorption. Further, the mechanism of the photocatalytic degradation is proposed to involve a double photo-activation of the LFO and TiO2 semiconductor phases, leading to the formation of pairs of charges (electron/hole) in both semiconductors (Eq.3-4), with improved charge separation due to the formation of a p-n heterojunction. Thus, the relative band positions of both semiconductors [44] -with both valence and conduction bands of the ferrite being more cathodic than the corresponding bands of the titania after Fermi level alignment (type-II staggered gap model) -, is proposed to allow the electrons generated in the conduction band of LFO to be transferred to the conduction band of titania, in accordance with fluorescence lifetime measurements, while holes in the valence band of TiO2 would migrate to that of LFO across the junction [44]. It is worth noting that the increased population of electrons in the conduction band of titania does not support the existence of a Z-scheme mechanism between both semiconductor phases, for which a shorter fluorescence lifetime should have been measured. Then, the larger concentration of holes in the ferrite semiconductor would lead oxidation reactions to occur preferentially on this phase (Eq. 5) [13], while the electrons accumulated in the conduction band of titania (Eq.6) would preferentially react with the adsorbed surface oxygen provoking the formation of the superoxide radicals which can lead to the organic matter oxidation too (Eq. 7) [6,9]. Further, the fact that the longer fluorescence lifetime in TiO2 does not match the most active coupled photocatalyst suggests that this optimum occurs as a balance between inter-phase electron transfer and an adequate relative amount of the component phases, taking into account that both are activated under solar light and therefore contribute with reactive electrons and holes. B. Under pure visible light, the mechanism of the reaction can only be initiated by the photoactivation of the narrow band gap ferrite phase leading to the generation of electron and holes (Eq. 8). While the photogenerated holes react with adsorbed water with the production of the active hydroxyl radicals (Eq. 9), the electrons are proposed to undergo inter-phase transfer from the higher-energy conduction band of the ferrite to the lower-energy conduction band of the titania (Eq. 10), whose role is to act as electron sink in the heterojunction material for reducing the charge recombination. The electrons in the conduction band of titania would further allow the reduction of O2 with the formation of the active O2 -° superoxide radicals (Eq. 11) involved also in the mineralisation of the refractory pesticide in water. LFO being here the only phase activated by the visible light, by contrast to reactions performed under solar light, the reactivity and efficiency maximum is shifted towards a higher LFO content in the composite. In these irradiation conditions, electron transfer to the titania conduction band would be the main factor responsible for the improved activity with respect to the pure phases and therefore the highest kinetic rate constants match the most extensive charge transfer according to fluorescence lifetimes. Figure 8A shows the evolution of the myclobutanil concentration with time, taking the time necessary for achieving a complete myclobutanil depletion during the first cycle as standardized test duration (ie. 180 min). After 4 test cycles, the 5-LFO/TiO2 composite photocatalyst was characterized by a slight deactivation, with the myclobutanil conversion being reduced from 100% to 96% for 180 min of test, and the corresponding apparent rate constant only slightly decreasing from 0.018 to 0.016 min -1 . This was corroborated by the lower mineralization degree reached after the 4 th test, ie. 90% of TOC conversion for 4 h of test (Figure 8B). This slight and progressive deactivation could be ascribed to the consecutive loss of iron species to the aqueous solution during the photoreactions, that was associated to the formation of surface iron carboxylate complexes from carboxylic acid-type intermediates as often observed in the case of high mineralization degree materials. However, the leached iron concentration stabilized at the negligible level of 0.07 mg/L after several consecutive test cycles.A.
