        <p>The deployment of bioenergy has turned into a severe issue associated with energy security and greenhouse gas reduction. The development of technologies in the renewable energy market depends on the profitability of their investment. However, the Net Present Value of new technologies' investment is affected by technical and economic uncertainties. Hence, the probability assessment of a positive Net Present Value and identifying critical economic and technical parameters can inform investors and decision-makers about any investment risks. This study evaluates the overall uncertainty in the Net Present Value of investment in cogeneration plants composed of a gasifier fed with biomass and a bottoming Internal Combustion Engine fed by the gasification product gas. Monte Carlo simulation assesses the probability of a positive Net Present Value for three sizes of cogeneration plants.The deployment of bioenergy has turned into a severe issue associated with energy security and greenhouse gas reduction.

        <p>Regarding sizes, the chance of generating a positive Net Present Value ranges from 66% to 90%, while the larger plants have a higher chance. The sensitivity analysis findings show that above all, biomass cost and then the sale price of electricity and the quantity of gasification product gas are the most dominant parameters. Using an internally produced biomass waste resource and possible achievement of green energy certificates on energy produced would make the initiative successful.Regarding sizes, the chance of generating a positive Net Present Value ranges from 66% to 90%, while the larger plants have a higher chance.

        <p>The growing demand for energy generation and environmental problems caused by fossil fuel consumption has increasingly stimulated industry towards renewable energy applications. Italian energy balance reveals that the gross national consumption of energy is 160 Mtoe, containing over 6 Mtoe non-energy uses. The domestic production of primary sources meets about 23% of national demand, chiefly derived from renewable sources (23.5 Mtoe), followed by gas (6.3 Mtoe) and petroleum (5.85 Mtoe). While the most extensive domains in energy consumption are transport (32.6%), followed by the residential sector (28.8%), industry (22.7%), services (13.4%) and agriculture (2.3%) (GSE, 2016), the consumption of heating and cooling accounts for 71% of total energy consumption of the all sectors. Agriculture is one of the sectors where renewable energies are massive in using available ground and roofs areas for solar applications (Carlini et al., 2010) and exploitation of biomass, primarily if waste is obtained as a byproduct of the agricultural process. Among power generation systems, combined heat and power (CHP) configurations are essential thanks to enhancing energy security by reducing domestic energy requirements and supporting businesses against energy price volatility and supply interruptions, especially when fed by local and renewable fuels as biomasses. Finally, and above all, the CHP systems fed by biomass (Putrasari et al., 2016) guarantee climate change and environmental goals due to the mitigation of CO 2 emissions and other contaminants.The growing demand for energy generation and environmental problems caused by fossil fuel consumption has increasingly stimulated industry towards renewable energy applications.

        <p>Researchers have addressed techno-economic aspects to develop biomass CHP applications and attempt to penetrate the energy markets. For instance, Borello et al. (2015) analysed technoeconomic issues of an 800 kW pomace gasifier with an MGT for CHP and determined an excellent performance of the system related to the total sale of heat. Effects of some critical operating parameters and economic factors on the thermodynamic and economic behaviour of a CCHP system fed by biomass, geothermal energy and fossil energy have been analysed in the Chinese context by Zhang et al. (2018). Patrick (2012) showed the results of a techno-economic analysis of biomass coming from tea factories. Hamedani et al. (2020) tried to fix what could be the environmental and economic outcome of an anaerobic digestion power plant presented into externalities. In this case, the finding showed that externalities could be considered an added value (Carlini et al., 2017). Biomass gasification (Ishaq and Dincer, 2020), compared with other CHP systems, can reach remarkable overall efficiency in the lower and middle range of power. Hence, it is considered a promising CHP technology for technology developers and policymakers (Lettner et al., 2007), and the viability of these systems from a techno-economic perspective is of potential importance.Researchers have addressed techno-economic aspects to develop biomass CHP applications and attempt to penetrate the energy markets.

        <p>By the way, Codignole et al. (2015) evaluated the economic feasibility of electrification by municipal solid waste gasification in Brazil by NPV and IRR indicators. Huang et al. (2013a) carried out a techno-economic evaluation of two different types of smallscale CHP configurations (direct biomass combustion and ICE) integrated with biomass gasification) based on accounting capital and operating costs of plants. Chang et al. (2019) performed a thermo-economic analysis on combined heat and power system connected with a rice husk gasifier and presented the economic profitability via simple PBP, NPV and profit ratio indicators. Seo et al. (2017) conducted an economic analysis on a small scale biomass gasification producing heat and power and presented financial indicators such as NPV, IRR and PBP. Li et al. (2018) investigated the coal to hydrogen process based on ash agglomerating fluidized bed gasification and after the energy analysis in terms of energy and exergy efficiencies.By the way, Codignole et al.

        <p>Furthermore, the investment has been evaluated for four different sizes, in tons of hydrogen per year, employing the indicators mentioned above (NPV, PBP, investment, and ROI), showing a wide variation of results between the different sizes considered and also emphasizing the market trends of involved fuel prices. Hadidi and Omer (2017) examined the financial viability of a waste to energy facility based on gasification and digestion processes using several financial indicators. Economic performance and technical development of technological projects are always affected by uncertainties associated with market fluctuations, which require careful consideration. Meanwhile, the outstanding ability of some approaches such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) (Beltrán et al., 2020) due to the application of probability distributions for describing inherent uncertainties in variables of risk analysis has been proved in financial risk evaluation of bagasse sugarcane biorefineries (Mandegari et al., 2018), willow pyrolysis cogeneration unit (Kuppens et al., 2018), Brazilian microgrid projects (Williams et al., 2018) as well as the production process of energy products (Osaki and Jr, 2017;Lee et al., 2017).Furthermore, the investment has been evaluated for four different sizes, in tons of hydrogen per year, employing the indicators mentioned above (NPV, PBP, investment, and ROI), showing a wide variation of results between the different sizes considered and also emphasizing the market trends of involved fuel prices.

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, very few studies dealt with the integrated analysis of techno-economic and investment risk assessment of the biomass gasification CHP system (S2Biom, 2018) at the considered sizes. Cardoso et al. (2019a) investigate the feasibility of an 11 MW gasification based power plant project using the same financial indicators having recourse to the Monte Carlo simulation to measure the risk associated with the project. Cardoso et al. (2019b) also analysed a forest biomass gasification system for 100 and 1000 kW power production systems determining the lack of profitability of the smaller ones. The sensitivity analysis has been made considering variables as electricity sales tariff, initial investment, O&amp;M cost and Discount rate plus electricity production as the only non-economic parameter. Copa et al. (2020) outlined a comparative techno-economic analysis of small-scale gasification systems fed by different biomasses. Although some studies (Cardoso et al., 2019a;Copa et al., 2020) addressed sensitivity analysis, assessing the variability impact of both economic and technical items on financial indicators is still untouched.To the best of our knowledge, very few studies dealt with the integrated analysis of techno-economic and investment risk assessment of the biomass gasification CHP system (S2Biom, 2018) at the considered sizes.

        <p>In all investment risk assessments addressing biomass gasification CHP, only cost variables such as the price of products (electricity price), energy sources (biomass) and capital investment are considered without taking into account the uncertainty of experimental design parameters such as working temperature, plant efficiency and gasification agent rate.In all investment risk assessments addressing biomass gasification CHP, only cost variables such as the price of products (electricity price), energy sources (biomass) and capital investment are considered without taking into account the uncertainty of experimental design parameters such as working temperature, plant efficiency and gasification agent rate.</p>

        <p>This study evaluates the economic feasibility of biomass gasification CHP systems in Italy, emphasizing scale economies' effect. Financial indicators, namely NPV, IRR and PBP are estimated for three different scales (100 kW th , 1 MW th and 10 MW th ). Compared with the plethora of work regarding the analysis of NPV, IRR, and PBP coupled with a Monte Carlo simulation for biomass systems, the present work focuses on the comparison of different sizes of a small-scale biomass gasification cogenerator system evaluating the impact of both technical and economic parameters. Furthermore, the considered gasification technology is a BFB system whose performance has deeply been analysed in the authors' previous works. By the way, as the risk assessment tool, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to check the sensitivity of NPV for changes in the input variables, including economic and technical ones, and to predict the probability of a positive NPV at the three sizes of CHP power plants.This study evaluates the economic feasibility of biomass gasification CHP systems in Italy, emphasizing scale economies' effect.

        <p>The plant consists of the following parts: biomass hopper, screw feeder as well as a rotary valve for the biomass feeding, a bubbling fluidized bed reactor, ash handling equipment, catalytic filter candles as the tar cleaning system, heat exchanger and finally, the CHP unit, which consists of an ICE-generator set. After passing through catalytic filter candles and cyclone, purified syngas is driven to the CHP unit. A heat exchanger absorbs the excess heat from the combustible gas into a water tank to ensure low gas temperature at the ICE inlet. Afterwards, the cooled gas enters the engine coupled with a DC generator to produce electricity while an exhaust gas heat exchanger receives the heat from this generator.

        <p>The NPV is calculated concerning a discount rate of 6%, regulating whether the project can be accepted. The NPV descends per increasing discount rates value since the NPV trend is inversely proportional to the discount rate.The NPV is calculated concerning a discount rate of 6%, regulating whether the project can be accepted.

        <p>Results show that the NPV for the gasifier CHP project realized in 13.6 kWe is 33.90 ke (Fig. 3a), 537.07 ke for 136 kWe (Fig. 3b) and 13268.96 ke for 1.94 MWe (Fig. 3c). The IRR rate is 10% for 13.6 kWe, 25% for 136 kWe and 71% for 1.94 MWe. It appears that considering economies of scale, investment in the larger plant is more profitable and grows economic benefits.Results show that the NPV for the gasifier CHP project realized in 13.6 kWe is 33.90 ke (Fig. 3a), 537.07 ke for 136 kWe (Fig. 3b) and 13268.96 ke for 1.94 MWe (Fig. 3c).

        <p>However, since the values of expenditure and revenue items are highly uncertain, uncertainty analysis must validate our findings. These values are affected by biomass feedstock sources, which is of potential importance due to variability in feedstock prices and the heating value of gasification output (syngas) (Malek et al., 2019).However, since the values of expenditure and revenue items are highly uncertain, uncertainty analysis must validate our findings.

        <p>Monte Carlo simulations approach, as one of the most straightforward methods to apply uncertainty analysis (Kuppens et al., 2018), has been performed to check the sensitivity of the NPV, IRR and PBP for changes in the input variables of the technoeconomic model and to predict the probability of a positive NPV.

        <p>Under the above assumptions, there is a 90% chance of a positive NPV for 136 and 1,940 kW e , respectively, while the smallest scale (13.6 kW e ) has a slighter chance (66%).

The summary of the Monte Carlo statistics is presented in Table 6.Under the above assumptions, there is a 90% chance of a positive NPV for 136 and 1,940 kW e , respectively, while the smallest scale (13.6 kW e ) has a slighter chance (66%).

        <p>The contributions of each variable's uncertainty to the variability of the NPV are indicated in Fig. 4. A positive percentage value reflects an increase in the value of the NPV. For instance, in the 13.6 kW e plant, a higher syngas yield (output of gasification) increases NPV by 6.4%. The most significant variable in all three scales influencing the NPV is biomass cost, and the impact of this parameter can be mitigated only in the case of self-production of the biomass waste resource; otherwise, it depends on the market. According to Fig. 4a, an increase in the electricity sale price can favourably affect NPV value and decrease the probability of negative NPV in this size. Therefore, the allocation of incentives in the business model improves the results obtained. Working hours and gasification efficiency connected to syngas yield are that with a higher probability for positive NPV. At small sizes, electricity price has a very remarkable impact as well, and in case of lack of incentives, it is necessary to bargain favourable conditions or make the kWh e also rewarded in the form of externalities (Hamedani et al., 2020).The contributions of each variable's uncertainty to the variability of the NPV are indicated in Fig. 4.

        <p>The feasibility of biomass gasification CHP systems still presents many uncertainties. This article comparatively evaluates the economic issues for three different sizes of small-scale biomass Bubbling Fluidized Bed gasification ICE-based CHP system considering technical variables -in addition to economic ones usually examined within the present literature -and utilizing Monte Carlo simulation for a risk assessment. The financial results have been determined through a sensitivity analysis, and they assist decision-makers in the strategic choices aimed to support the development of biomass gasification CHP systems. The NPV in the base case economic model ranges 2.49 to 6.98 kEUR kWe -1 confirming scale economies' role in investment profitability. Since economic values obtained are highly uncertain, these uncertainties have been evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. Results show a 66% chance of a positive NPV for 13.6 kW e, while this chance is up to 90% in the larger sizes. The sensitivity analysis findings show that biomass cost, the sale price of electricity and the amount of gasification product gas are the most influential economic model parameters. First of all, biomass cost affects adversely all three sizes systems' performance and one way to minimize and mitigate the risk consists of relying on biomass as an inner resource of the initiative responsible. Furthermore, the need for a mature technology consisting of maximum CAPEX and OPEX reduction at small sizes attainable using a further simplification and contemporaneous optimization of the energy system is emphasized. Furthermore, it is noted that the biomass gasification CHP systems can raise the profit if owners are in a position to take advantage of Renewable Energy Credits such as green energy certificates or other incentives. Finally, the effects of technical parameters, as syngas yield and operative hours, have a remarkable impact on the performance optimization of the largest system, achieving an increase above 20%. Contrary to this trend, in the smallest system results, economic parameters, costs and revenues, prevail in comparison with technical parameters.The feasibility of biomass gasification CHP systems still presents many uncertainties.
