        <p>Acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis represents a sustainable route for valueadded CO 2 transformations. However, competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid remains a great challenge for selective CO 2 -to-HCOOH production, especially in industrial-level current densities. Main group metal sulfides derived S-doped metals have demonstrated enhanced CO 2 -to-HCOOH selectivity in alkaline and neutral media by suppressing HER and tuning CO 2 reduction intermediates. Yet stabilizing these derived sulfur dopants on metal surfaces at large reductive potentials for industrial-level HCOOH production is still challenging in acidic medium. Herein, we report a phase-engineered tin sulfide pre-catalyst (π-SnS) with uniform rhombic dodecahedron structure that can derive metallic Sn catalyst with stabilized sulfur dopants for selective acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis at industrial-level current densities. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the π-SnS has stronger intrinsic Sn-S binding strength than the conventional phase, facilitating the stabilization of residual sulfur species in the Sn subsurface. These dopants effectively modulate the CO 2 RR intermediates coverage in acidic medium by enhancing *OCHO intermediate adsorption and weakening *H binding. As a result, the derived catalyst (Sn(S)-H) demonstrates significantly high Faradaic efficiency (92.15 %) and carbon efficiency (36.43 %) to HCOOH at industrial current densities (up to -1 A cm -2 ) in acidic medium.Acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis represents a sustainable route for valueadded CO 2 transformations.

        <p>Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to formic acid (HCOOH) provides a promising strategy for renewable energy storage and CO 2 recycling 1-3 . Specifically, HCOOH is an ideal liquid intermediate for hydrogen storage with high energy density 4,5 . Previous studies mainly focus on suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline or near-neutral solutions to improve selectivity. However, these processes exhibit disadvantages for practical applications: (1) Formate (HCOO -) instead of HCOOH is obtained in alkaline or near-neutral electrolytes because the dissociation constant (pKa) of HCOOH is 3.75 6 . Therefore, additional conversion and separation treatment are required to obtain HCOOH. (2) Over 75% of input CO 2 has been consumed by reacting with hydroxide (OH -), and the dominant by-products carbonate (CO 3 2-) or bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) together with HCOO -would pass anion exchange membrane (AEM) to the anode and then be re-oxidized to CO 2 , resulting in low carbon efficiency and product loss 7-9 . (3) Continuous input of CO 2 reduces the pH value of the electrolyte, leading to the poor stability of the catalysts and membrane. Therefore, electrolyte needs to be renewed routinely, especially in alkaline medium [10][11][12] .Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to formic acid (HCOOH) provides a promising strategy for renewable energy storage and CO 2 recycling 1-3 .

        <p>Recent studies of acidic CO 2 RR mainly focus on alkali-cation strategy, which significantly suppresses HER and promotes CO 2 RR in acidic medium by tuning the electric field in the double layer to inhibit the migration of hydronium ions toward cathode 6,[16][17][18] . For example, Gu et al. reported the SnO 2 /C pre-catalyst with 0.8 M K + ions for efficient CO 2 -to-HCOOH production in acid media, which illustrated a -220 mA cm -2 of maximum HCOOH partial current density and the FE up to 88 %, respectively 6 . Qiao et al. proposed high concentration (3 M) of K + -assisted CO 2 RR with Bi nanosheets in an acidic medium to produce HCOOH, as FE reached 92.2% with the current density of -237.1 mA cm -2 , and achieved carbon efficiency of 27.4 % 16 . However, ampere-level current of CO 2 -to-HCOOH production in acidic medium has not been achieved using this strategy because HER gradually dominates the overall reaction when the applied current densities are over -300 mA cm -2 . Thus, acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis at industrial current density (over -300 mA cm -2 ) still remains a great challenge. Considering the higher CO 2 concentration in acidic medium [19][20][21] , we reasoned that modulating the coverage of CO 2 RR reaction intermediates is a possible way to suppress HER and promote CO 2 -to-HCOOH production. Specifically, enhancing the adsorption of *OCHO on the catalyst interfaces and weakening the adsorption of *H or H 2 O have the potential to optimize the CO 2 RR intermediates coverage under high current density 7 . Therefore, selective HCOOH production may be effectively improved in this way.Recent studies of acidic CO 2 RR mainly focus on alkali-cation strategy, which significantly suppresses HER and promotes CO 2 RR in acidic medium by tuning the electric field in the double layer to inhibit the migration of hydronium ions toward cathode 6,[16][17][18] .

        <p>Main group metal sulfides (SnS, In 2 S 3 , etc.) were widely employed as the pre-catalysts for CO 2 -to-HCOOH production because the derived S-doped main group metal catalysts show enhanced selectivity for HCOOH/HCOO -formation with inhibition of HER [22][23][24] . Practically, the S dopants in the main group metals can optimize the adsorption of CO 2 RR intermediates and suppress the hydrogen or water adsorption. For example, Ma et al. reported S-doped indium (S-In) catalyst for enhanced HCOO -production in near-neutral media with 93% of FE and -84 mA cm -2 partial current density, which is better than In, Se-In and Te-In catalysts. Therefore, tailoring S-doping is an efficient way to promote HCOO -production in alkaline or near-neutral media at current densities below -200 mA cm -2 . However, the industrial-level current of CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis in acidic medium was still significantly limited due to the over-reduction of S dopants at high overpotentials, followed by a rapid increase in HER. Therefore, stabilizing S dopants on metals subsurface at industrial current densities is crucial to promote acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH production.Main group metal sulfides (SnS, In 2 S 3 , etc.) were widely employed as the pre-catalysts for CO 2 -to-HCOOH production because the derived S-doped main group metal catalysts show enhanced selectivity for HCOOH/HCOO -formation with inhibition of HER [22][23][24] .

        <p>In this study, we realized acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH production (pH = 3) at industrial current densities by phase engineering of SnS (π-SnS) pre-catalyst. Compared to conventional phase of α-SnS, π-SnS has stronger metal-S binding strength, leading to higher S residual at large CO 2 RR current densities, confirmed by theoretical simulations and in situ characterizations. The high S content in Sn subsurface modulates the *OCHO coverage and promotes CO 2 -to-HCOOH production at industrial current densities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the S-doped Sn has a stronger *OCHO adsorption and weaker *H adsorption than the pure metallic Sn, leading to high coverage of CO 2 -to-HCOOH intermediates at high current density for selective HCOOH production. As a result, the π-SnS-derived catalyst illustrates a maximum FE of 92.15% toward HCOOH, a partial HCOOH current density of -730 mA cm -2 , and 36.43% of single-pass CO 2 utilization in acidic medium.

        <p>Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of π-SnS for acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis. By employing phase engineering strategy, strong intrinsic binding strength between Sn and S is realized in π-SnS, which stabilizes higher S content in the subsurface of Sn metals after CO 2 RR activation. As a result, strong *OCHO adsorption and weak *H adsorption achieved on π-SnS-derived catalyst during CO 2 RR, and the high coverage of *OCHO intermediate on the S-Sn sites could promote acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH production and suppress HER at industrial-level current densities.Figure 1 illustrates the evolution of π-SnS for acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis.

        <p>The π-SnS was prepared by a hydrothermal method (see Methods), which is achieved by mixing SnCl 2 •2H 2 O, cysteine and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images (Fig. 2a,b) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. 2c) reveal uniform rhombic dodecahedron structure of π-SnS with a particle size of 262 ± 37 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the determined π phase in cubic crystal system (a, b, c = 11.83 Å) matches well with the simulated XRD pattern of the π-SnS. It is noteworthy that the π phase has only been discovered recently as a new family of materials. Controllable synthesis of π phase-based materials remains greatly challenging, and only a few studies have developed small-scale π phase-based materials synthesis 25,26 . In this work, we provided a simple and efficient method to successfully synthesize π-SnS with uniform rhombic dodecahedron morphology, which is rare among metal sulfides. For comparison, conventional α phase SnS (α-SnS) refers to definite layered structures with an orthorhombic crystal system (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2). The chemical compositions of π-SnS and α-SnS were confirmed by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with an atomic ratio of ~1:1 between Sn and S (Supplementary Fig. 3). The high-angle annular darkfield scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) and corresponding EDS mapping images further confirm the excellent crystalline structure of π-SnS with the homogeneous distribution of Sn and S elements (Fig. 2d-f). The atomic structures of π-SnS together with corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns (Fig. 2d,e) confirm the well-defined cubic structure with exposed (110) facet, which is in agreement with the simulated structure (Fig. 2e,g).

        <p>To reveal the different bonding strengths between Sn and S, we further detect the coordination environment in different phases by synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The Fouriertransformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectrum of π-SnS illustrates a shorter Sn-S average bond length in the first shell than that in α-SnS (Fig. 2h), which is consistent with the bond length in their model structures (Supplementary Fig. 4). The shorter Sn-S bond in π-SnS means a stronger Sn-S bond energy than α-SnS 27,28 . X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Sn K-edge determine the similar oxidation states of Sn in π-SnS and α-SnS (Supplementary Fig. 5), which excludes the effect of high oxidation states Sn (Sn 4+ ) on the binding energy. Wavelet-transform (WT)-EXAFS analyses (Fig. 2i) reveal a distinct larger k-value of π-SnS (11.0 Å -1 ) than that of α-SnS (7.3 Å -1 ).

        <p>Extensive studies confirm that the reconstitution of various metal compounds at reduction potentials in CO 2 RR is a common but complicated phenomenon. Derived catalysts typically display distinct structures from their pre-catalysts, however, this reconstitution process is often ignored. The identification of derived catalysts via reconstitution can contribute to a better understanding of the origin of catalytic performance [31][32][33] . Here, we investigate the structural differences of the catalysts derived from π-SnS and α-SnS through CO 2 RR activation. We performed the CO 2 RR reduction for 900 s at -100 mA cm -2 to derive S-doped Sn from different phases of SnS (Supplementary Fig. 6). The major differences between the two derived catalysts are the amount of residual S. We observed higher content of S-doping in Sn (Sn(S)-H) and lower content of S-doping in Sn (Sn(S)-L) derived from π-SnS and α-SnS pre-catalysts, respectively. First, metallic Sn peaks in XRD analysis indicate that both π-SnS and α-SnS are reduced to Sn metals with the main exposed (100) facet (Fig. 3a). The weak peak at 26.6 degree should be attributed to the Sn oxidation during XRD test (SnO 2 , JCPDS# 70-4177). HAADF-STEM (Fig. 3b) and corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 7) confirm the reconstitution of pre-catalysts with a trace amount of S residual. Furthermore, in situ Raman characterization was performed to trace the structural evolution process of π-SnS and α-SnS pre-catalysts in -1.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 8). The clear Sn-S stretching signal (168 cm -1 , 188 cm -1 , 220 cm -1 ) remained well in Sn(S)-H after 7 h reduction, suggesting the good residual content of S element after CO 2 RR activation 22,34,35 . However, the Sn(S)-L derived from α-SnS shows undetectable Sn-S stretching only after 3 h reduction, indicating a complete reduction of the material. We further adopted synchrotron-based soft X-ray near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) to compare the S content of catalysts derived from π-SnS and α-SnS. The similar broad peaks around 2480.6 eV are attributed to the adsorbed SO 4 2-and SO 3 2-from the electrolyte, while the retention of S (Sn-S, around 2472.6 eV) in these two samples (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 8c) are distinctly different. This is because Sn(S)-H has a higher S amount after CO 2 RR activation than Sn(S)-L. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results for the samples derived from π-SnS CO 2 RR activation under high current density ( -400 mA cm -2 ) display higher S amount, which accords well with NEXAFS data (Fig. 3f). The similar evidence of higher residual S amount in Sn(S)-H could also be found in other sulfur-free acidic electrolytes (Supplementary Fig. 9). Due to the complexity of the reconstitution to the derived catalysts, we also checked other potential factors such as defects which could affect the catalytic performance 32,33 . As no obvious defects were observed in both Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L (Supplementary Fig. 10), we confirm the main difference after reconstitution between Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L is the amount of residual S. Such differences of residual S amount in derived catalysts can be attributed to the phase engineering strategy on the pre-catalysts.

        <p>Electrochemical CO 2 RR measurements for derived Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L were conducted in a standard three-electrode flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) as the working electrode (see Methods). The pH value of the electrolyte was adjusted to 3.0 using H 2 SO 4 in 0.5 M K 2 SO 4 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves show both lower onset potentials of Sn(S)-H ( -0.86 V vs. RHE) and Sn(S)-L ( -1.12 V vs. RHE) in CO 2 -saturated electrolyte than in Arsaturated electrolyte, indicating a favorable CO 2 RR pathway for the two derived catalysts at low overpotentials (Supplementary Fig. 12) 36 . With increasing applied potential, HER on Sn(S)-L gradually dominates, while Sn(S)-H exhibits a better HER suppression in Ar-saturated electrolyte with a larger Tafel slope. In addition, Sn(S)-H has a significantly larger current density in CO 2 -saturated electrolyte, suggesting a better CO 2 RR performance (Supplementary Fig. 12). It is well known that the overall catalytic activity normally consists of two parts: the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of catalysts 37,38 . The Sn(S)-H catalyst has a lower value of electrochemical surface area (ECSA), confirming a higher intrinsic CO 2 RR activity of Sn(S)-H in acidic medium than that of Sn(S)-L (Supplementary Fig. 13).Electrochemical CO 2 RR measurements for derived Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L were conducted in a standard three-electrode flow cell with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) as the working electrode (see Methods).

Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves show both lower onset potentials of Sn(S)-H ( -0.86 V vs. RHE) and Sn(S)-L ( -1.12 V vs. RHE) in CO 2 -saturated electrolyte than in Arsaturated electrolyte, indicating a favorable CO 2 RR pathway for the two derived catalysts at low overpotentials (Supplementary Fig. 12) 36 . With increasing applied potential, HER on Sn(S)-L gradually dominates, while Sn(S)-H exhibits a better HER suppression in Ar-saturated electrolyte with a larger Tafel slope. In addition, Sn(S)-H has a significantly larger current density in CO 2 -saturated electrolyte, suggesting a better CO 2 RR performance (Supplementary Fig. 12). It is well known that the overall catalytic activity normally consists of two parts: the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of catalysts 37,38 . The Sn(S)-H catalyst has a lower value of electrochemical surface area (ECSA), confirming a higher intrinsic CO 2 RR activity of Sn(S)-H in acidic medium than that of Sn(S)-L (Supplementary Fig. 13).</p>
        <p>We further quantified the FE of HCOOH in the derived catalysts in a chronopotentiometry mode with the applied current densities from -0.1 to -1 A cm -2 (Supplementary Fig. 14). Gas and liquid products were determined using gas chromatography (GC) and 1 maximum FE of 92.15 ± 1.26% for HCOOH at -200 mA cm -2 , together with over 85% FE for HCOOH in a wide range of current densities (Fig. 4a), corresponding well with 1 H NMR and GC results in each current density (Supplementary Figs. 15-17). In comparison, lower FE (65-70%) of Sn(S)-L was obtained from -100 to -300 mA cm -2 , accompanied by obviously increased HER at high current densities, shown in Fig. 4b. Figure 4c highlights the differences in FE among Sn(S)-H, Sn(S)-L and pure Sn, reflecting a better HER suppression performance of Sn(S)-H. As a result, the Sn(S)-H achieves -730.2 mA cm -2 partial HCOOH current density and yields a high production rate of 13.7 mmol h -1 cm -2 , which is better than most reported catalysts in alkaline or near-neutral medium (Supplementary Fig. 18, Supplementary Table 1). It is worth noting that pure Sn metal also shows a dominated HER performance at high current densities (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 19), elucidating the significant role of S dopants in Sn subsurface for efficient acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH production. In addition, when we increased the concentration of hydronium ions at pH = 1, Sn(S)-H maintained good performance in suppressing HER for HCOOH production (Supplementary Fig. 20). For acidic CO 2 reduction, metal dissolution with related long-term stability are important aspects that can not be ignored 32,33,39 . Sn(S)-H shows a 85% FE of HCOOH production under -400 mA cm -2 in 13.5 h stability measurement (Fig. 4d). In addition, Sn(S)-H maintained metallic Sn structure with stable S-Sn bonding after stability measurement (Supplementary Figs. 21, 22). While Sn(S)-L exhibited continuously decreasing FE of HCOOH for 6 h with a distinctly higher Sn dissolving ratio than Sn(S)-H (Supplementary Fig. 23), which could be attributed to the dissolution of S-Sn sites.We further quantified the FE of HCOOH in the derived catalysts in a chronopotentiometry mode with the applied current densities from -0.1 to -1 A cm -2 (Supplementary Fig. 14).

        <p>Recently, carbon efficiency of CO 2 RR has received constant attention because over 50-75% of input CO 2 is consumed to produce CO 3 2-or HCO 3 -in alkaline medium 6,7,40 , reducing the economic benefits. Therefore, single-pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of activated Sn(S)-H catalysts was detected at -400 mA cm -2 at different CO 2 flow rates (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 17b). Remarkably, 36.43% of SPEC was achieved (with partial SPCE for HCOOH being 34.54%) during the CO 2 flow rate at 5 standard cc min -1 (sccm). Besides, with the CO 2 flow rate increasing from 2 to 10 sccm at -400 mA cm -2 , the significant growth of FE for HCOOH indicates the positive CO 2 RR pathway against HER of Sn(S)-H. Since the economic value of HCOOH is $1000 USD per ton, which far exceeds that of CO 2 of $70 per ton 41,42 , it is found that the CO 2 -to-HCOOH process at the flow rate of 10 sccm has the highest economic value by balancing carbon efficiency and FE. In addition, the production rate of HCOOH on Sn(S)-H also exceeds most catalysts operated in alkaline/neutral solutions (Fig. 4f) 16,21,[43][44][45] .Recently, carbon efficiency of CO 2 RR has received constant attention because over 50-75% of input CO 2 is consumed to produce CO 3 2-or HCO 3 -in alkaline medium 6,7,40 , reducing the economic benefits.

        <p>In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in flow cell was employed to reveal the reaction mechanism of CO 2 -to-HCOOH on Sn(S)-H. No obvious CO 3 2-or HCO 3 -signal was observed from 1000 to 1100 cm -1 , indicating the suppression of carbonate production with a local acid environment on the Sn(S)-H catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 24). The same phenomenon was also observed at high overpotentials from -1.4 to -2 V. The narrow peak at 1550 cm -1 corresponds to asymmetric stretching vibration (ν as O-C-O) of *OCHO 46,47 . Since no obvious *COOH adsorption peaks were detected, *OCHO was determined as the primary intermediate for acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH in our work, which agrees with the main intermediate of HCOO -formation in neutral and alkaline media 4,48,49 .In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) in flow cell was employed to reveal the reaction mechanism of CO 2 -to-HCOOH on Sn(S)-H.

        <p>We further performed in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to compare the coverage of *OCHO on Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 25) with the applied potentials from -0.5 to -1.9 V vs. RHE. Similarly, no evident *CO (to CO product) appeared from 1900 to 2100 cm -1 , which agrees with the in situ SERS results. For two CO 2 -to-HCOOH intermediates, *OCHO is widely considered more efficient than *COOH for HCOOH production 4,36 . As shown in Fig. 5a, the distinct *OCHO signal around 1367 cm -1 on Sn(S)-H together with no obvious *OCHO hydrogenation intermediates detected in in situ ATR-FTIR experiments, confirm the efficient HCOOH generation of Sn(S)-H 34,50 . However, the notable low peak area on Sn(S)-L are mainly due to competitive HER on the catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 25). To further reveal the intrinsic relationship between *OCHO adsorption coverage and CO 2 RR performance, we compared the FTIR peak areas (around 1342-1380 cm -1 ) of Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L with the function of overpotential (Fig. 5b). Both Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L exhibited no evident signal before -0.7 V (vs. RHE) of CO 2 RR onset. In contrast, the rapid growth of *OCHO peak area from -0.7 to -1.1 V (vs. RHE) on Sn(S)-H can be attributed to the onset of CO 2 -to-HCOOH production, which is consistent well with the electrochemical data (Supplementary Fig. 12). After that, the increased peak areas in Sn(S)-H on large overpotential region suggest more significant *OCHO coverage than that in Sn(S)-L, which explains the origin of the enhanced CO 2 -to-HCOOH performance on Sn(S)-H by chronopotentiometry tests. Note that the slightly decreased *OCHO peak area from -1.7 V to -1.9 V (vs. RHE) suggests the competitive HER in the reaction, which is in accordance with the minor FE loss from -0.4 to -1 A cm -2 .We further performed in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) to compare the coverage of *OCHO on Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 25) with the applied potentials from -0.5 to -1.9 V vs. RHE.

        <p>To understand the formation mechanism of Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L catalysts, surface Pourbaix diagrams for the π-SnS and α-SnS were analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The (110) facet is chosen for the calculation, corresponding to the dodecahedral morphology of π-SnS pre-catalyst observed in the SEM experiment (Fig. 2b). The most stable surface with the lowest surface free energy under different potential (U) and pH conditions is shown in Fig. 5c. Compared with α-SnS (110), the stoichiometry of π-SnS(110) surface is stable over a wider range of electrochemical conditions (green area). Especially, under the experimental conditions of around U = -1.1 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), pH = 3 (black dotted box), α-SnS(110) has completely removed the surface S to exhibit a Sn-rich surface, while π-SnS(110) starts the surface reduction of S. This indicates that the S-atom bonding at the π-SnS surface layer is stronger than that of α-SnS. Therefore, it can be speculated that after the reduction of π-SnS, S atoms are more likely to remain on the surface, corresponding to the higher S atoms content measured experimentally (Fig. 3e,f). To further reveal the CO 2 RR mechanism in derived Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L catalysts, the adsorption free energy (G ad ) of the competing intermediates on the derived S-doped Sn catalysts surface was then calculated 51,52 . Herein, various possible adsorption configurations were considered, and the most stable adsorption structure for *OCHO was taken as the active site (Supplementary Fig. 26). For HCOOH production, the formation of *OCHO intermediates was considered as a determining step via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process 4,19 . Compared with the pure Sn surface, the binding of the carbon-containing species *OCHO is significantly stronger on S-doped Sn, while *H adsorption is much weaker (Fig. 5d), indicating the suppression of HER after S doping. This data is also in accordance with the high *OCHO coverage on Sn(S)-H observed in the in situ ATR-FTIR (Fig. 5a,b). In addition, G ad (*OCHO) is much lower than G ad (*COOH), i.e., the intermediate to generate HCOOH is more energetically favorable than that to generate CO, which is consistent with the observed strong peak for *OCHO on Sn(S)-H catalyst in the in situ SERS and in situ ATR-FTIR spectra (Fig. 5a,b).To understand the formation mechanism of Sn(S)-H and Sn(S)-L catalysts, surface Pourbaix diagrams for the π-SnS and α-SnS were analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

        <p>The free energy diagram shows the mechanism for CO 2 RR producing HCOOH (Fig. 5e). Under U = -1.1 V vs. SHE, the reaction is basically a readily exothermic process. The stronger adsorption of *OCHO on S-doped Sn well explains the high selectivity HCOOH at the catalyst at high current density (Fig. 4a). The pathway via *OCHO is energetically more favorable than *COOH (Supplementary Fig. 27), which confirms that the reaction selectively produces HCOOH rather than CO. To better understand the influences of the doping S atoms on various adsorption species, a differential charge density analysis was carried out between Sn (100) surface with and without S-doping (Fig. 5f). When a subsurface Sn atom is replaced by S, the electron density on the surface is significantly reduced (blue area), indicating that the Sn bonded to S in the surface layer is positively charged. Therefore, such surface active sites are more inclined to interact with the electron-rich oxygen-containing groups, especially the *OCHO with two O atoms binding with the surface, rather than the proton *H. The theoretical calculations above imply that S-doped Sn promotes CO 2 RR to produce HCOOH but suppresses HER. Thus, the modestly increased S amount in Sn(S)-H demonstrates a better CO 2 RR performance than Sn(S)-L.The free energy diagram shows the mechanism for CO 2 RR producing HCOOH (Fig. 5e).

        <p>In summary, we report a phase engineering strategy of π-SnS that can stabilize rich S dopants on Sn subsurface in acidic medium for efficient CO 2 -to-HCOOH production. The stabilized Sn-S active sites modulate CO 2 RR intermediates coverage, achieving acidic CO 2 -to-HCOOH electrolysis (pH = 3) with industrial-level current densities. The π-SnS derived S-doped Sn catalyst achieves a high FE (over 70%) of HCOOH production with current densities from -0.1 to -1 A cm -2 in acidic medium. Furthermore, the HCOOH production rate can reach the industrial level of 13.7 mmol h -1 cm -2 , superior to most reported electrocatalysts. FT-EXAFS, in situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that π-SnS has a stronger intrinsic binding strength of Sn-S than conventional α-SnS with shorter Sn-S bond, which derives higher S content in the Sn subsurface (Sn(S)-H) after CO 2 RR activation under high current density. The Sn-S active sites have strong *OCHO adsorption and weakened *H adsorption, leading to a more energetically favorable CO 2 -to-HCOOH pathway for Sn(S)-H, unveiled by in situ SERS, in situ ATR-FTIR and DFT calculations. More importantly, the Sn-S active site promotes *OCHO coverage at high current densities, leading to stable and high-rate production of HCOOH. Our work demonstrates the importance of phase-engineering in optimizing catalysts for high-performance acidic CO 2 RR and provides a promising route toward the efficient electrosynthesis of value-added chemicals at industrial current density.In summary, we report a phase engineering strategy of π-SnS that can stabilize rich S dopants on Sn subsurface in acidic medium for efficient CO 2 -to-HCOOH production.
