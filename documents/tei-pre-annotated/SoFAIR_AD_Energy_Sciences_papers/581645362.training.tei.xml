        <p>Nanofluids have numerous applications in heat transference procedures due to their exceptional thermal characteristics. The most desirable parameter to enhance the solar collector's performance is the enhancement of the convective heat transfer coefficient between the working fluid tubes and the absorber. As a result, nanofluids have gained prominence as working fluids in solar thermal systems. The trendsetting review reveals that mostly the nanofluids in solar collectors are based on water employing nanoparticles of Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , SiO 2 , and CuO. Besides, nanoparticle concentration is a challenging factor in using nanofluids. In this research, under controlled conditions, the working fluids multi-wall carbon nanotube, Aluminum Oxide, and hybrid MWCNT/Al 2 O 3 50:50% were experimentally examined for the thermal efficiency enhancement of the evacuated tube solar collector. For each type of nanofluid, four volume concentration percentages (0.5%, 0.025%, 0.01%, and 0.005%) were examined along with three distinct mass flow rates. According to the findings, using hybrid MWCNT/Al 2 O 3 50:50% delivers an efficiency boost of about 20% overusing Al 2 O 3 , as was previously reported. Finally, it was found that the utilization of 0.5% MWCNT/water nanofluid at 3.5 L/m can enhance the ETSC's energy and exergy efficiency to reach 73.5% and 51% respectively while reaching approximately 60% and 44% for AL 2 O 3 , and 69% and 38% for hybrid MWCNT/Al 2 O 3 (50:50%) under the same test conditions.Nanofluids have numerous applications in heat transference procedures due to their exceptional thermal characteristics.

        <p>We are facing the challenges of decreasing fossil fuel availability. Many alternative renewable sources of energy could actively bring down the utilization of conventional fuel supplies. Solar energy is a crucial option in many developing countries' commercial and industrial sectors to narrow the use of fossil fuels and their harmful environmental impact. Solar water heating (SWH) is a cost-effective method of generating hot water for domestic or commercial process heating utilizing solar thermal energy. The solar heat collector should be opted for based on the amount of energy it takes, the desired thermal spectrum, as well as the system's economy. In hospitals, domestic uses, and other operations in several businesses, huge quantities of energy go sunk and wasted specifically for water heating. Water heating utilizes a huge amount of fossil fuel, resulting in environmental damage and climate change owing to greenhouse gas emissions. In general, a solar collector is regarded as thermal equipment because it is designed to capture solar energy and convert it to heat energy. These systems usually get benefited from utilizing the working fluid that acts as an energy carrier by traveling through the solar collector pipes and absorbing the sun's energy. Although there are many different types of solar collectors, they can be mainly classified as stationery and sun-tracking concentration collectors. Stationary collectors consist of Evacuated Tube Solar Collectors, Flat Plate Solar Collectors, and Compound Parabolic [1].We are facing the challenges of decreasing fossil fuel availability.

        <p>Flat Plate Solar Collector (FPSC) and Evacuated Tube Solar Collector (ETSC) are the two most common types of solar water heaters. The ETSCs are characterized by vacuum insulation and careful exterior coating of the absorber component, resulting in high heat derivation functioning, heat loss can be decreased, and is suitable for foggy or severely cold circumstances. FPSC is a well-known solar collector for providing fluid temperatures in the 50-100 • C range, among other solar thermal collectors. Both forced; using a circulation pump, and thermosiphon water circulation; which uses the thermosiphon effect of water to operate, are used by SWH systems. Additionally, the working fluid is the component that absorbs the most heat from the collector, so replacing conventional fluids with nanofluids may be the most efficient technique to enhance heat transfer in the collectors under discussion [2]. Thermal energy is by far the most widely employed form of solar energy in water boiling and heater systems in both residential and commercial settings.Flat Plate Solar Collector (FPSC) and Evacuated Tube Solar Collector (ETSC) are the two most common types of solar water heaters.

        <p>According to Perea-Moreno et al., solar thermal systems might cut annual emissions by 90 α.14 tons of N 2 O, 804.2 tons of CO 2 , and 0.114 tons of CH 4 . The energy-conversion efficiency of solar collectors is low, and research has been done to enhance it. To address this issue, numerous studies on the application of various working fluids have been carried out. It is a common method to change the working fluid to increase the solar collector's efficiency by adding high thermal conductivity nanoparticles. A nanofluid is a fluid that contains a relatively small quantity of uniformly distributed and suspended nano-sized particles with an average size of fewer than 100 nanometers in the base fluid. When a little percentage of nano-sized particles is added to a pure fluid, its thermal conductivity is increased, and the fluid is called nanofluid. Nanofluid has gained popularity in scientific research in the field of heat transfer in recent years, notably for renewable energy applications. Solar collector efficiency is improved by using nanofluids. As a result, more heat from the sun is received, and the demand for fossil fuels is reduced.According to Perea-Moreno et al., solar thermal systems might cut annual emissions by 90 α.14 tons of N 2 O, 804.2 tons of CO 2 , and 0.114 tons of CH 4 .

        <p>If nanoparticles are uniformly disseminated and stably floating in base fluids, their partial contribution improves the thermal characteristics of the base fluid [4]. Nanofluid was first invented by Choi in 1995, with nano-sized particles varying from 1to100 nm in colloidal amalgam accompanying the working fluid and the nanoparticle fluid mixtures. Nanoparticles are made from a variety of materials, which includes both carbide and oxide ceramics, metals, nitrides, semiconductors, nanotubes made of carbon, and other composite materials including nanoparticle &amp; core-polymer composites and alloyed nanoparticles depending on the application [5]. "Hybrid metals" are created when two or more materials are blended in such a way that the resulting blend would have an entirely new chemical bond. In fact, "hybrid nanofluid" was coined when more than one metal derived a homogenous phase with concurrent mixing. When compared to unitary nanofluids, such a modern class of nanofluids demonstrated potential improvements in heat transport characteristics as well as thermophysical and hydrodynamic characteristics [6]. Aside from the nonmetal components, the metal and other materials used for the nanoparticles, and different structures that have been used, are referred to as "doped" with molecules in the solid-liquid state. The result is the acquisition of exceptional thermal properties associated with the smallest practicable volume fraction (Λ =1%). As a result, Improved heat transfer requires floating nearly mono-dispersed nanoparticles or non-accumulated in mixtures [7]. When utilizing a 1% nanoparticle concentration, the heat enhancement of a nanofluid flow over water flow is around 5%, and it rises to 12% when using a 2% nanoparticle concentration [8].If nanoparticles are uniformly disseminated and stably floating in base fluids, their partial contribution improves the thermal characteristics of the base fluid [4].

        <p>The main four primary benefits of utilizing nanofluids in solar thermal systems can be stated as follows. First, nanofluids have high conductivity, and heat transmission coefficient, also the reduced specific heat of such particles, increases the efficiency of thermo-devices. Second, nanoparticles possess a very reduced size and a big surface area, which results in an exponential rise in the heat valence of nanofluid and solar energy absorption. Third, better optical properties; better optical properties include greater absorption and extinction coefficients. Fourth, nanofluids take out the needed heat transmission area and lower the important transmission surface in these systems. Fifth, the advantages of nanofluids over micro-suspension; nanofluids have higher stability in terms of clogging and sedimentation of pumps and pipes due to their extremely small size when compared to micro or suspended millisized particles, and that is an important aspect to be considered in several solar applications [9]. One of the most difficult aspects of employing nanofluids is the increase in pressure drop and pumping power caused by high viscosity and nanoparticle concentration. MWCNT and Al 2 O 3 have been the most common nanofluids, with a few additional nanofluids such as CuO, ZnO, SWCNT, Ag, SiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , and TiO 2 [10]. Table 1 gives the readings of different metal oxides that are generally employed as heat transfer materials at 300 K temperatures.The main four primary benefits of utilizing nanofluids in solar thermal systems can be stated as follows.

        <p>The ETSCs have been investigated using nanofluids in many experimental and numerical studies. High-concentrated SWCNT nanofluids have better thermal conductivity, allowing more heat to be absorbed by the fluid. The Brownian flow had a significant impact on the evacuated collector system due to the circulation of nanofluid in the tube at a particular flow rate rather than being stopped. The thermal performance was compared to the state with water, it was discovered that employing SWCNT nanofluids as heat transfer fluid increased collector efficiency. More specifically, the comparable maximum efficiency in this circumstance was 0.2 vol%. At a mass flow rate of 0.025 kg/s, the efficiency of SWCNT nanofluids was discovered to be 93.43% and 48.57% for 0.05 vol% nanoparticle concentration.

        <p>In an experimental investigation of the use of MWCNTs as a working fluid in a solar plate collector, Natarajan and Kiatsiriroat discovered that MWCNTs significantly outperform most other nanoparticles, especially for high temperatures applications [14]. According to Faizal et al., lowering the collector size by 37% can be employed by using MWCNT/water as the working fluid while keeping the same efficiency [15]. Tong et al., studied the effect of using MWCNT/water as a base fluid for ETSCs. The results show that by using MWCNT/water with a concentration of 1% as a working fluid, the ETSC's efficiency increased by 8% compared to water [16]. A theoretical study done by Kim et al. shows that applying MWCNT/water with 0.2 vol.% in U-tube ETSC can improve its efficiency to reach 62.8% [17]. Dehaj et al. used MgO nanofluid to perform an experimental analysis based on an ETSC. Water/magnesium oxide nanofluids with concentrations of 0.014 percent and 0.032 percent were combined and tested in a heat pipe ETSC at flow rates of 5, 8, 11, and 14 L/min. It was discovered that the heat pipes ETSC using the considered nanofluid have substantially greater efficiency of 69% and 77% for the two studied flow rates respectively compared to 60% for using base water.

Fig. 10 represents the useful heat gained for pure water compared with MWCNT and Al 2 O 3 in the ETSC. The useful heat gain can be expressed as the increasing percentage of the outlet temperature for the same mass flow rate. Using nanoparticles boosts the heat energy supplied by both systems, which is the main goal of this work. The thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and density of the solar collector's working fluids vary when nanoparticles are added. By intensifying heat transmission, increasing the thermal conductivity of the working fluid helps to increase the heat gain of the solar collector.One of the most improved factors as a result of using nanofluids in ETSCs is the amount of gained heat energy. The given heat energy values for pure water compared with MWCNT/ Al 2 O 3 50:50% in the ETSC are presented in Table 8. It shows an increase from a value of 281 W for the case of water to higher values of 432 W, 421 W, 368 W, and 284 W for the concentrations of 0.005, 0.01%, 0.025%, and 0.05%, respectively at a flow rate of 1.5 L/min.

        <p>The heat removal factor (F R ) is the proportion of the collector's actual usable heat energy transferred to the maximum available heat energy and is influenced by the fluid's thermos-physical properties; hence the addition of nanoparticles can enhance it. When the inlet fluid temperature is identical to the ambient temperature, the maximum amount of heat energy may be transported; no heat is lost to the surroundings. Also, because it appears at two parameters in the same equation, the heat removal factor F R has a double side effect on the collector's efficiency: absorbed energy parameter F R (τα) and removal energy parameter F R U L . If the F R value rises, it signifies that more heat energy was absorbed, and the temperature of the outflow fluid increased. Also, as the temperature of the output fluid rises, the temperature of the collector's absorber plate rises, increasing heat loss with the ambient temperature.The heat removal factor (F R ) is the proportion of the collector's actual usable heat energy transferred to the maximum available heat energy and is influenced by the fluid's thermos-physical properties; hence the addition of nanoparticles can enhance it.

        <p>To determine the maximum available energy that may be converted to usable heat, it is also necessary to study the exergetic efficiency of the ETSC. The exergy efficiency of solar systems refers to the exergy flow of the generated usable heat to the incident solar irradiation flow. Exergy analysis is a thermodynamic tool used to assess each energy source based on its properties, most commonly on its temperature levels. The exergy analysis is also used as an indicator to characterize and examine the investment opportunities of sustainable and green technology as well as renewable energy sources. Exergy helps in improving inefficiencies and reducing thermodynamic drops, which are in line with more environmentally friendly energy systems. Furthermore, it can aid in understanding the environmental and financial advantages of energy systems more precisely than energy analysis. By reducing energy losses, improving energy efficiency can lessen its negative effects on the environment.To determine the maximum available energy that may be converted to usable heat, it is also necessary to study the exergetic efficiency of the ETSC.
