        <p>Multi-functionalized and co-doped TiO2/C nanocomposites derived from the pyrolysis of Ti-MOFs at 800 o C under different gaseous atmospheres were produced and their photocatalytic performance were investigated. The gaseous atmosphere during pyrolysis plays a critical role in determining the structural, textural, optical and physicochemical properties of the derived TiO2/C composites, due to the synergistic effects of nitrogen-containing species, carboxylate and/or sulfur functionalized porous carbons and N/S co-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. All the Ti-MOFs derived TiO2/C composites exclusively possess homogeneously distributed TiO2 nanoparticles in functionalized disc-like porous carbon matrix and demonstrate much enhanced adsorption and photodegradation performance than commercial TiO2 under the same conditions. The adsorption and degradation of methylene blue (MB) in dark on these TiO2/C composites are dominated with pseudo second-order kinetic model and the high adsorption and degradation capacity of MB in dark on composite TiO2/C derived from MIL-125(Ti) in argon is due to its high surface area with predominant mesoporous carbon matrix in the composite.Multi-functionalized and co-doped TiO2/C nanocomposites derived from the pyrolysis of Ti-MOFs at 800 o C under different gaseous atmospheres were produced and their photocatalytic performance were investigated.

        <p>The composite N-O-TiO2/C derived from NH2-MIL-125(Ti) in water vapor exhibited the highest photodegradation activity with 99.7% MB removal in 3 hours under visible light due to the optimal anatase/rutile phasejunction, together with the formation of photoactive oxygenrich N-O like interstitial/intraband states above the valence band of TiO2, as well as the presence of rich N-containing species and -OH/-COOH multi-functional groups with superhydrophilic nature of the composite. This simple one-step and easily modifiable approach can be further employed to modulate many homogeneously dispersed multi-functionalized and co-doped metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites for various environment and energy-related applications.The composite N-O-TiO2/C derived from NH2-MIL-125(Ti) in water vapor exhibited the highest photodegradation activity with 99.7% MB removal in 3 hours under visible light due to the optimal anatase/rutile phasejunction, together with the formation of photoactive oxygenrich N-O like interstitial/intraband states above the valence band of TiO2, as well as the presence of rich N-containing species and -OH/-COOH multi-functional groups with superhydrophilic nature of the composite.

        <p>Photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants using the sunlight has been proved to be a viable solution to mineralize the toxic contaminants in wastewater [1]. The photodegradation of organic pollutants involves the sunlight as a source of energy and a semiconducting material with appropriate energy band gap as a photocatalyst to carry out the photocatalytic redox reaction to decompose the toxic molecules into benign species such as CO2 and H2O [1][2][3][4][5].Photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants using the sunlight has been proved to be a viable solution to mineralize the toxic contaminants in wastewater [1].

        <p>A large variety of transition metal semiconducting materials such as TiO2 can be utilized as photocatalysts [6,7]. However, due to the wide energy band gap of TiO2 (3.2 -3.0 eV), it only absorbs the UV light which consists of 5% of the solar spectrum. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies of the photocatalytic materials can be significantly improved if the photocatalyst could absorb light in visible region which comprises around 43% of the solar spectrum. Several strategies have been successful developed to narrow the energy band gap of semiconducting TiO2 including the doping of metallic and/or non-metallic species, the formation of heterojunctions, as well as the generation of defects [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. However, other challenges, such as the inaccessibility of the photocatalytic active sites due to the formation of agglomerates of TiO2 nanoparticles, inevitably limit the photodegradation performance of the photocatalysts. Therefore, various methods have been tried to improve the accessibility of the active sites and to prevent the formation of agglomerate by mixing TiO2 with carbon i.e., graphene or porous carbon to form composites [17][18][19][20]. Although the metal oxide/carbon composites demonstrated improved photocatalytic performance, the composites produced via physical and mechanical mixing methods usually result in a non-uniform distribution of metal oxides on graphitic carbon and poor textural properties with limited enhancement in photocatalytic performance [21][22][23]. A promising and high performing photocatalyst should demonstrate modifiable textural, optical and surface properties. Obviously, the pore sizes and pore shapes of the photocatalysts with high surface area should be appropriate to accommodate the organic pollutants. Moreover, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of surface-attached functional groups also play a significant role in maximizing the interaction between organic pollutants and the photocatalyst [14,24]. Clearly, the TiO2/C composites obtained via the conventional routes lack such synergistic properties.A large variety of transition metal semiconducting materials such as TiO2 can be utilized as photocatalysts [6,7].

        <p>The past 10 years have witnessed enormous growth in the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived materials for a large variety of applications in various fields including environment and energy [25][26][27]. MOFs consist of metal ions and organic linkers, bound together by the coordination bonds to form highly porous polymeric structures [28][29][30][31]. Their distinct features such as high crystallinity, modifiable morphologies, tunable textural properties and easily surface functionalization make them exceptional materials to be used as precursors and sacrificial templates to generate porous metal oxide/carbon composites [3,26,32]. MOFs derived composites offer a combination of tunable properties such as physicochemical, structural, optical and textural properties which play a critical role in the adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants. The surface-attached functional groups act as trapping centres and the open pore networks with appropriate pore shapes and sizes facilitate the diffusion of organic dye molecules into the micro/mesopore channels and access to active sites of metal oxide photocatalysts [33][34][35]. It is believed that during the photodegradation of organic pollutants, the visible light irradiation generates electron-hole pairs in semiconducting metal oxides. The photoinduced electrons (e -) jump to the conduction band and react with oxygen presented in the water, producing superoxides (O2• -); whereas the photoinduced holes (h + ) in valence band form hydroxyl (•OH) radicals via water oxidation. The reduction of organic dye is induced by O2• -, whereas the •OH radicals oxidize the organic dye molecules, leading to their mineralization [2,23,36,37]. Though a few studies on MOF derived TiO2/C composites for photocatalysis have been reported, to the best of our knowledge, no detailed study is available on the Ti-MOF derived multi-functionalized and co-doped TiO2/C composites for photocatalytic activity [37][38][39].The past 10 years have witnessed enormous growth in the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived materials for a large variety of applications in various fields including environment and energy [25][26][27].

Briefly, 30 mM (5.43 g) of 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH2-BDC) was added into 100 mL solution of dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol (MeOH) (with 1:1 volumetric ratio) in a 200 mL glass bottle and stirred for 15 min at room temperature. Once fully dissolved, 7.3 mM (2.47 mL) of Ti(OBu)4 was added into this solution under constant stirring for 10 minutes and then transferred the glass bottle to an oil bath at 130 ºC for 40 hours.

        <p>To investigate the role of surface functionalization and non-metal doping of Ti-MOF derived TiO2/C composites in photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, adsorption and photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) were measured in dark and under visible light irradiation respectively.

        <p>Fig. 1a also presents the Rietveld refinements of PXRD pattern of TiO2/C composite [44]. A good agreement between the experimental measurements and refined data was observed. All the parameters were allowed to refine simultaneously once it was estimated that the model was stable. The small values of R parameters (Rwp and Rp) and 𝜒 2 ≈ 1 as shown in Table S1 indicate that the model was a good approximation of the true structure of derived composites. The weight fraction (%) of anatase and rutile phases in the derived composites was calculated using quantitative Rietveld refinement. Under an argon atmosphere at 800 ⁰ C, MIL-125(Ti) decomposed, forming of 53% well crystalline anatase phase with main diffraction peak at (101) and 47% of rutile phase with main diffraction peak at (110) in sample TiO2/C. However, the thermal decomposition of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) under the same pyrolysis conditions resulted in the formation of N-TiO2/C composite containing 36% crystalline anatase and 64% rutile phase. Introducing water vapor as a mild oxidation source at the target temperature of 800 ⁰ C, the resulting sample N-O-TiO2/C composite derived from the decomposition of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) exhibited 34% of anatase phase and 66% of rutile phase. Interestingly, if NH2-MIL-125(Ti) precursor is pyrolysed in H2S gaseous atmosphere where H2S was introduced along with the argon gas, the formed sample N-S-TiO2/C composite is pronouncedly 74% of rutile phase of TiO2 together with 26% of anatase phase. Frequently, carbon, sulfur and even nitrogen species in the system can act as reducing agents and influence the localized chemical environment, which consequently promote the phase transformation from anatase to rutile phase, due to the doping of these heteroatoms into anatase lattice and forming defects and oxygen vacancies in the resulting composites. In these studied samples, the content of the rutile phase (as shown in Table S1) are estimated to be 47, 64, 66 and 74 % for samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-O-TiO2/C and N-S-TiO2/C respectively. A clear trend can be observed that the presence of multiple reducing agents C and N (from the organic linker NH2-BDC) and S (from H2S gaseous atmosphere) promotes the formation of higher content of rutile phase than anatase phase in these samples.. [43] Obviously, the pyrolysis gaseous atmosphere of the precursors plays a very important role in the formation of different level of crystalline phases of MOF derived TiO2 polymorph. It is widely recognized that the appropriate anatase to rutile ratio of TiO2 phases is an important parameter to determine the formation of anatase/rutile TiO2 phasejunction [45][46][47][48], which are photocatalytically active that could improve the photogenerated charge separation and migration, and suppress the charge recombination [40,45,48,49]. The Rietveld refinements provide further details including estimated particle sizes, volume and density of anatase and rutile phases along with the goodness of fit parameters as shown in Table S1. FTIR spectra (Fig. S4) of the Ti-MOFs derived composites all exhibit a vibrational band at around 3440 cm -1 due to the stretching of O-H groups from surface absorbed H2O. Relatively low intensity but broader peak at around 2000 cm -1 (highlighted in the inset) in sample N-S-TiO2/C can be assigned to the vibrational modes of S species doped into TiO2 crystal lattice [16]. A smaller peak at 1815 cm -1 in sample N-O-TiO2/C prepared under water vapor atmosphere may appear due to the stretching modes of -COOH functional group in the carbon matrix [40]. Two prominent peaks at around 1620 cm -1 and 1385 cm -1 in all samples can be assigned to the stretching vibrational modes of C=C in aromatic rings and bending vibrational which can be attributed to the O=C-O functional groups attached on the surface of porous carbon matrix due to the pyrolysis of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) under the water vapor gaseous atmosphere [34]. An additional smaller peak appeared at 533.9 eV in sample TiO2/C can be assigned to the other non-lattice O species including and oxygen related defects and vacancies. [54] The XPS spectra of N 1s (Fig. 3d) shows that no N 1s peak was observed in sample TiO2/C. However, two peaks appearing at around 400.60 and 398.08 eV in samples N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C can be assigned to the pyrrolic N and pyridine N species present on porous carbon matrix [17,50]. It is interesting to note that samples N-TiO2/C and N-S-TiO2/C exhibited third peak at 396.02 and 395.91 eV respectively, which can be attributed to the substitutional N atoms forming Ti-N bonds in TiO2 crystal lattice [17,53]. However, this peak is completely absent in sample N-O-TiO2/C. During the high temperature pyrolysis of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) under argon, N species from -NH2 functional groups could replace O 2p states with N1s states to form substitutional Ti-N bonds, causing the N doping into TiO2 lattice.Fig. 1a also presents the Rietveld refinements of PXRD pattern of TiO2/C composite [44]. A good agreement between the experimental measurements and refined data was observed. All the parameters were allowed to refine simultaneously once it was estimated that the model was stable. The small values of R parameters (Rwp and Rp) and 𝜒 2 ≈ 1 as shown in Table S1 indicate that the model was a good approximation of the true structure of derived composites. The weight fraction (%) of anatase and rutile phases in the derived composites was calculated using quantitative Rietveld refinement. Under an argon atmosphere at 800 ⁰ C, MIL-125(Ti) decomposed, forming of 53% well crystalline anatase phase with main diffraction peak at (101) and 47% of rutile phase with main diffraction peak at (110) in sample TiO2/C. However, the thermal decomposition of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) under the same pyrolysis conditions resulted in the formation of N-TiO2/C composite containing 36% crystalline anatase and 64% rutile phase. Introducing water vapor as a mild oxidation source at the target temperature of 800 ⁰ C, the resulting sample N-O-TiO2/C composite derived from the decomposition of NH2-MIL-125(Ti) exhibited 34% of anatase phase and 66% of rutile phase. Interestingly, if NH2-MIL-125(Ti) precursor is pyrolysed in H2S gaseous atmosphere where H2S was introduced along with the argon gas, the formed sample N-S-TiO2/C composite is pronouncedly 74% of rutile phase of TiO2 together with 26% of anatase phase. Frequently, carbon, sulfur and even nitrogen species in the system can act as reducing agents and influence the localized chemical environment, which consequently promote the phase transformation from anatase to rutile phase, due to the doping of these heteroatoms into anatase lattice and forming defects and oxygen vacancies in the resulting composites. In these studied samples, the content of the rutile phase (as shown in Table S1) are estimated to be 47, 64, 66 and 74 % for samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-O-TiO2/C and N-S-TiO2/C respectively.

        <p>When NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was pyrolyzed in argon and H2S gaseous atmosphere to prepare composite N-S-TiO2/C, both the N atoms and the S atoms can replace O 1s through S→O exchange which further modifies the electronic structure of TiO2. It is worth noting that the ionic radius of S 2-is larger than that of O 2-, therefore, the relatively small amount of doped S species along with the N species favor the formation of additional defects in TiO2 crystal lattice [16]. However, the absence of the substitutional N 1s peak in sample N-O-TiO2/C indicates that under water vapor atmosphere, the presence of an excess amount of oxygen species suppresses the formation of substitutional Ti-N species; instead, oxygen-rich N-O like interstitial/intraband (Ti-O-N) states can be formed [40,53]. It is assumed that under water vapor atmosphere, oxygen species compete with and dominate N atoms doping into TiO2, which results in preventing the substitution of the O 2p by N 1s in TiO2. It is well understood that the formation of doping states via non-metal dopants introduces additional electronic levels above the valance bands, which narrows the energy band gaps [10,53,55]. This was further confirmed by XPS valence band edge spectra.When NH2-MIL-125(Ti) was pyrolyzed in argon and H2S gaseous atmosphere to prepare composite N-S-TiO2/C, both the N atoms and the S atoms can replace O 1s through S→O exchange which further modifies the electronic structure of TiO2.

        <p>show an obvious change in crystal lattice spacing of N and/or S doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The lattice spacing of rutile TiO2 (110) was estimated to be 0.33, 0.337, 0.34 and 0.322 nm for samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C respectively. The varying values of TiO2 lattice spacing in these composites are due to the presence of dopants like N and/or S species, the defects and oxygen vacancies. The optical property of a semiconducting material primarily depends on its energy band gap that reflects the capability of electrons migration from the occupied valance band to the unoccupied conduction band [61,62]. The energy band gaps of pure anatase and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles are usually observed at 3.2 and 3.0 eV respectively. When the dopants, defects and impurities including metal and non-metal elements are introduced into the crystal lattice, additional electronic states/levels can be formed below the conduction band or above the valence band respectively. In the case of TiO2, the valence band edge comprises of O 2p orbitals and conduction band edge of Ti 3d orbitals [62]. The introduce of non-metal dopants including N and S atoms could form interstitial states above the valence band edge or replace the O 2p atoms to form substitutional Ti-N and Ti-S bonding states [55,63]. As a result, the N and S doping into TiO2 may introduce additional electronic transition states with increased density of states that narrows the energy band gap, resulting in inferior TiO2 photoactive under the visible light [62].

        <p>The degradation and photocatalytic performance of MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) derived composites was tested in dark and under visible light. The kinetics of adsorption of MB by the different nanocomposites were evaluated by applying various kinetic models. As shown in Fig. 6a, no self-degradation of methylene blue (MB) was observed in dark. As a comparison, the commercially available TiO2 (P-25) was used as a reference sample and it showed only 0.7% adsorption in dark due to its non-porous nature. The Ti-MOFs derived composite samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C exhibited 57, 26, 28 and 32% adsorption of MB after 180 minutes in dark respectively. The adsorption by all the composite samples mainly took place in the first 30 minutes. Actually, the predominated adsorption of MB happens in the first 10 minutes for samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C, followed by an almost flat curve, implying the achieving of adsorption/desorption equilibrium (Fig. 6a). The higher percentage of MB adsorption by composite TiO2/C in dark is b due to its relatively higher surface area (558 m 2 g -1 ) and the presence of larger pores (mesopores with sizes &gt; 2 nm).The degradation and photocatalytic performance of MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) derived composites was tested in dark and under visible light.

        <p>To illustrate the effect of surface functionalization and textural properties on the adsorption of MB, four kinetic models including pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order, Elovich kinetic and intraparticle diffusion models (Fig. 6b-e) were applied to calculate the rate of adsorption reaction and rate-controlling factors in the MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) derived composites [9,67]. The values of the relevant parameters of the four kinetic models for samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C are summarized in Table S4.To illustrate the effect of surface functionalization and textural properties on the adsorption of MB, four kinetic models including pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order, Elovich kinetic and intraparticle diffusion models (Fig. 6b-e) were applied to calculate the rate of adsorption reaction and rate-controlling factors in the MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) derived composites [9,67].

        <p>Among the four fitted models, pseudo second-order kinetic model exhibits the highest values of correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.99 for the adsorption of MB by composite samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C, indicating it is the best fittings of the model.Among the four fitted models, pseudo second-order kinetic model exhibits the highest values of correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0.99 for the adsorption of MB by composite samples TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C, indicating it is the best fittings of the model.</p>
        <p>Therefore, pseudo second-order kinetic model is the best to describe the kinetics of adsorption and degradation of MB by these studied MOF-derived composites. The pseudo second-order rate reaction depends upon the amount of the solute adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst (adsorbent) and the amount being adsorbed at equilibrium [68]. According to this model, the composite TiO2/C showed the highest equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe) of 59.77 mg•g -1 compared to other composites, which exhibited maximum equilibrium adsorption capacities of 26.49, 29.39 and 31.74 mg•g -1 for samples N-TiO2/C, N-S-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C, respectively. The higher equilibrium adsorption capacity of MB by TiO2/C can be attributed to the relatively larger surface area, predominant mesopores and higher pore volume. Clearly, the best fitted R 2 values of the pseudo second-order model in these composite samples suggests that the higher BET surface area and the surface-attached hydroxyl /carboxylate (-OH/-COOH) functional groups play the key role in facilitating faster adsorption of MB molecules and access to the active sites [67,68]. The intraparticle diffusion model exhibits linear plot of t 1/2 verses qt if the intraparticle diffusion is involved as a rate-controlling factor only [67,69]. In this model, two or more slopes could also occur in case of the multistep adsorption process. As shown in Fig. 6e, rapid adsorption of MB on composites TiO2/C, N-TiO2/C and N-O-TiO2/C in first 30 minutes occurred due to the boundary layer diffusion which can be attributed to the predominant mesopores and the slow adsorption in the following 2.5 hours (intraparticle diffusion indicated by the second slope in Fig. 6e) could be due to the presence of micropores [70]. In general, the intraparticle diffusion model exhibits the lowest values of correlation coefficient of R S5), sample N-O-TiO2/C demonstrates to be one of the most efficient photocatalyst to decompose MB under visible light.Therefore, pseudo second-order kinetic model is the best to describe the kinetics of adsorption and degradation of MB by these studied MOF-derived composites.
