        <p>Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a promising and highly efficient solar technology. Despite efficiencies continuing to climb, the prospect of industrial manufacture is in part hampered by concerns regarding the safety and sustainability of the solvents used in lab scale manufacture. In this paper, we aim to present a methodology for green solvent selection informed by EHS considerations from the CHEM-21 solvent guide for successful methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI 3 ) precursor dissolution. Through the use of this methodology we present a N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-free alternative solvent system for deposition of MAPbI 3 precursors (MAI and PbI 2 ) consisting of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) and ethanol (EtOH). We have investigated 3 candidate solutions with slightly different compositions of these four solvents, all of which produce dense, uniform and pinhole-free perovskite films via spin coating. All three candidate solutions (A-C) match the average device efficiencies of the DMF/DMSO control devices (12.4%) with candidate A, which consists of 40% DMSO, 30% DMPU, 20% 2-MeTHF and 10% EtOH (vol%), producing a champion PCE of 16.1% compared to 16.2% for DMF/DMSO (80/20 vol%). Perovskite films cast from the three candidate solutions show improved crystallinity, higher fluorescence emission, and improved crystal size uniformity than those cast from DMF/DMSO. This work aims to: highlight the key solvent parameters which determine effective MAPbI 3 precursor dissolution; provide a set of criteria for appropriate alternative solvent selection; and demonstrate the application of green chemistry principles to solvent selection for perovskite photovoltaic manufacturing. † Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

        <p>Since their inception in 2009, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undertaken a meteoric rise to prominence with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) climbing from 3.8% 1 to 25.2%. 2 This record surpasses other thin film photovoltaic (PV) technologies 3 and is approaching the theoretical limit of 33% for a single junction device, rivalling monocrystalline silicon (Si), the PV market leader with record PCE of 26.7%. 4 One of the advantages of lead halide perovskites is that the exciton binding energy is low (∼50 meV), resulting in the formation of free charges at room temperature, negating the need for an interface to facilitate charge separation. 5 Lead halide perovskites for use in solar cells have an ABX 3 crystal structure where A is an organic cation (methylammonium CH 3 NH 3 + ), B is a metal cation (Pb 2+ ) and X is a halogen anion (I -, Cl -, or Br -).Since their inception in 2009, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undertaken a meteoric rise to prominence with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) climbing from 3.8% 1 to 25.2%. 2 This record surpasses other thin film photovoltaic (PV) technologies 3 and is approaching the theoretical limit of 33% for a single junction device, rivalling monocrystalline silicon (Si), the PV market leader with record PCE of 26.7%. 4 One of the advantages of lead halide perovskites is that the exciton binding energy is low (∼50 meV), resulting in the formation of free charges at room temperature, negating the need for an interface to facilitate charge separation. 5 Lead halide perovskites for use in solar cells have an ABX 3 crystal structure where A is an organic cation (methylammonium CH 3 NH 3 + ), B is a metal cation (Pb 2+ ) and X is a halogen anion (I -, Cl -, or Br -).</p>
        <p>Tuning the double and triple cation compositions can increase the stability and PCE e.g. through the addition of caesium (Cs -), rubidium (Rb -) and formamidinium (FA + ) ions into the perovskite crystal lattice. This compositional flexibility results in the ability to tune the band gap (E g ), 6 which is generally minimised for optimised light harvesting across the visible-NIR spectrum. 7 Simple solution-based processing and the potential printability of perovskites to create uniform films with reduced defects at low-cost and high throughput gives appeal to manufacturers seeking to commercialise PSCs, including within tandem modules. With record efficiency of up to 29.1%, 2 and the potential to exceed 30% in the near future, tandem devices show great promise as a commercial application for perovskites. 8 Previous studies estimate manufacturing costs for standalone perovskite devices to be half that of Si-PV. 9 These economic advantages over alternative PV technologies may be further enhanced through lifecycle optimisation and design for circular economy enabling remanufacturing of cells and recovery of cell components at lower cost than purchasing new ones, which will afford lower cost devices over successive product generations. [10][11][12] In the interests of eco-design, the use of hazardous and high environmental impact materials must be minimised throughout PV lifecycles. 10,13 Access to critical raw materials (CRMs) may also limit the deployment of renewable energy technologies and so where possible these should be substituted for more abundant materials or secondary raw materials, which don't raise the same materials security or conflict mineral issues and may be obtained with considerably lower environmental impact. 12,[14][15][16][17][18][19] On this basis, multiple components present in highly efficient PSCs reported to date require substitution e.g. gold and indium; as well as the solvents used to deposit thin-films during manufacture and potentially recovering those same materials in future recycling processes e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for perovskite and chlorobenzene for spiro-OMeTAD. [20][21][22] Traditionally, methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI 3 ) has been used as the light absorber layer in PSCs, deposited as a solution of the precursor compounds, MAI and PbI 2 , in DMF. 23 The presence of lead of in perovskite compositions is a hotly debated sustainability issue within the perovskite sphere. Lead, as a toxic chemical with a propensity to bioaccumulate, especially in aquatic ecosystems, may require substitution for an alternate metal cation. However, currently there are no alternatives that have replicated the high power conversion efficiencies of lead based perovskites. Several alternatives have been identified as potential replacements for lead (Pb 2+ ), including germanium (Ge 2+ ), bismuth (Bi 3+ ), and tin (Sn 2+ ). Of these competitor cations, Sn 2+ is the most promising with a recorded certified efficiency of ∼13%. 24 However, the oxidation of Sn 2+ to Sn 4+ remains a significant issue with MASnI 3 perovskite compounded by low defect tolerance, juxtaposed to the unique highly defect tolerant MAPbI 3 . 25 Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have also questioned the perceived benefits of a substitution from lead to tin, 26 with lead presenting a lower embedded energy than tin and problems associated with the toxicity of tin to aquatic environments. Aside from substitution, effective module encapsulation has been posited as a means for mitigating any potential release of lead from future devices, with the expectation of lead based encapsulated devices becoming a commercialised technology. We believe that the issues from the use of lead can potentially be managed through circular economy approaches to mitigate potential impacts arising from the use of perovskite modules throughout their entire lifecycle. 19 Given the current lack of alternatives to lead, and the superior performance of lead based perovskites, significant environmental and sustainabil-ity gains could be made from developing alternatives to the DMF solvent system, especially given the likely commercialisation of this technology in the near future. In addition to DMF, several alternative dipolar aprotic solvents for perovskite deposition have been used including γ-butyrolactone (GBL), 21,27 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 23,28 n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 29 and dimethylacetamide (DMAc) 30 with final film morphology and device performance varying due to differences in crystallisation dynamics between solvents. 28 Despite the range of solvents from which MAPbI 3 can be successfully deposited, highly efficient devices still rely on DMF based precursor solutions. Reproductive toxicity issues and a workplace exposure limit of 15 mg m -3 hinders the scalability of DMF for low-cost manufacturing. 31,32 It has also been proposed that the role of DMSO in lab scale cosolvent systems is vital for high efficiency devices due to enhanced system coordination effects. 33 A crucial challenge of solvent system engineering to support PSC development is to advance understanding of dissolution and coordination of MAPbI 3 precursors. 34,35 The impact of solvent fluid properties and colloidal metal-ligand configuration on device PCE should be ascertained to inform the selection of appropriate alternative sustainable solvents and improve the potential for large scale manufacturing.Tuning the double and triple cation compositions can increase the stability and PCE e.g. through the addition of caesium (Cs -), rubidium (Rb -) and formamidinium (FA + ) ions into the perovskite crystal lattice.

        <p>Several guides evaluating the validity of solvent selection have previously been reported. [36][37][38][39][40][41][42] Solvent selection based on environmental, health and safety (EHS) considerations in the absence of full lifecycle assessment has been conducted by numerous large chemical and pharmaceutical firms in the last decade including Sanofi, GSK, AstraZeneca and Pfizer. 40,[43][44][45][46] Subsequently, researchers have created unified guides consolidating this information, in part due to differences in the priorities of the organisations producing them. 42,[47][48][49] A major effort in this field was the creation of the innovative medicines initiative (IMI)-CHEM21 selection guide, 50 which has been used to guide this research. In addition to EHS considerations, solubility parameters help to identify suitable solvents for dissolution of perovskite precursors. The Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) has been applied in previous attempts to screen alternative solvents, 27,28 to identify solvents similar in Hansen space to DMF, DMSO, NMP, and DMAc. HSP attempts to quantify the solvating power of a solvent in relation to a specific solute by analysing the physicochemical properties of the system with respect to; molecular dispersion (δ D ), dipolar interactions (δ P ), and hydrogen bonding (δ H ). 51 Wang et al. (2017) compiled HSP data for commonly used MAPbI 3 precursor solvents and calculated the distance in Hansen space between the solvent and the assumed parameters of the lead iodide solute. 28 However, current theory indicates that HSP fails to account for ionic interaction between perovskite precursors and complexation in solution which prevents accurate application of the Hansen model to MAPbI 3 precursor dissolution. 28 Higher solvent polarity has, however, been linked to greater PbI 2 salt miscibility, 27 potentially aiding an increase in the concentration of precursor solutions. However, several notable highly polar solvents such as ethylene carbonate do not dissolve PbI 2 in contradiction to this theory, indicating influence from multiple solvent properties. 34 Hamill et al. (2017) indicated a distinct correlation between the Gutmann donor number (D N ), a basicity measure of the solvent, and the ability of the solvent to coordinate Pb 2+ from PbI 2 in solution. 34 Dissolving and retaining adequate concentrations of PbI 2 in solution for coating requires solvents which act as strong metal ligands. 52 DMSO was first proposed as a ligand additive with the poorly coordinating solvent GBL to retard crystallisation through the formation of an intermediate phase. 53 Lee et al. (2016) expanded on this theory suggesting that MAPbI 3 dissolution and deposition is dependent on Lewis acid-base interactions, where PbI 2 acts as a Lewis acid with a dipolar aprotic solvent Lewis base donor ligand. 23 Previous investigations of alternative solvent systems for spin coating, employed to improve sustainability, uniformity, and decrease defect densities have been reported. These include utilising methylamine gas as a post-treatment; 35 DMSO, 2-methylpyrazine (2-MP), and 1-pentanol (1-P) based inks; 28 and GBL, alcohol, cyclic carbonate and acid systems 27 (Table 1). Novel engineering solutions to this problem have been demonstrated, such as dissolving methylamine gas into an appropriate carrier solvent such as acetonitrile (ACN) to successfully deposit functional perovskite films. 52 This utilises strongly basic methylamine which in turn acts as the solvating agent for PbI 2 . A further application of this method bubbles methylamine through ethanol, which is subsequently mixed with tetrahydrofuran (THF), 54 a common low-cost solvent with high vapour pressure at room temperature, allowing rapid crystallisation over relatively large areas. Both of these systems use volatile bulk solvents and have found application in lab based roll to roll (R2R) manufacture. Due to limited options for DMF alternatives and understanding of the impacts of solubility parameters and crystallisation kinetics in these solvents, further investigation of MAPbI 3 deposition with available 'green' and safer solvents along with life cycle impact consideration is required to identify suitable and sustainable alternatives.Several guides evaluating the validity of solvent selection have previously been reported.

        <p>A crucial factor to consider is the deposition method used to coat precursor solutions onto substrates. Currently, the highest PCE devices are spin-coated at lab scale, with typical active areas of &lt;1 cm 2 , 3 whereas alternative methods with superior deposition efficiency are used for scaled-up production such as slot-die coating, spray deposition or inkjet printing for R2R production. Each technique requires specific consideration of the solvent parameters along with the physical and rheological properties that may differ from those of solvent systems developed for spin-coating. 57,58 Evidence suggests the reaction mechanism between Pb 2+ ions and a dipolar aprotic solvent results in effective dissolution of trihalide perovskite layers. 36 Due to the required dissolution of lead iodide, alternative dipolar aprotic solvents were shortlisted preferentially as Lewis basic ligands for solvation. When selecting solvent substitutes, primarily driven by EHS concerns, a balance needs to be achieved between performance and 'green' credentials. This requires a methodology to accurately rank respective solvents both in terms of EHS concerns and lifecycle impact considerations, whilst also performing characterisation of the perovskite layer as utilised within a competitively efficient device. DMSO is commonly used as a co-solvent and shows promise in sustainable precursor formulations due to its lack of carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) properties. However, a high boiling point and low vapour pressure limit its use in doctor blading and R2R slot die manufacturing, where more volatile non-coordinating solvents are favoured for near room temperature annealing. 59 A candidate list of commercially available alternative 'green' solvents, regardless of their polarity or hydrogen bonding affinity, was compiled. Consideration of boiling point and flash point was undertaken with these solvents pending industrial evaluation and mitigation by added cosolvents. The aim of this study was to identify commercially available 'green' solvents with desirable properties for the spin coating deposition of MAPbI 3 precursor solutions and evaluate their performance. We present a solvent screening methodology based on Hansen solubility metrics, donicity, and EHS considerations. Utilising this method, an alternative solvent system consisting of DMSO, 1,3-dimethyltetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone, also known as dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) and ethanol (EtOH) is presented and analysed. Furthermore, solvent engineering techniques have been applied to spin coat highly efficient films via a prenucleation method, optimising the candidate systems of different % compositions showcasing the potential versatility of a 'green' solvent toolbox. 23,34 Structural and optical studies were undertaken to elucidate the crystalline and photoluminescent nature of this novel perovskite.

        <p>The process used for screening candidate solvents is outlined in Fig. 1. Initial screening to identify dipolar aprotic solvents with similar properties to DMF was conducted. Polarity, as described by the dielectric constant was considered in initial screening to filter candidates as a majority of known solvents for use in perovskites have dielectric constants above 30, however, high polarity alone is not sufficient. 34 A further indicator used in screening was HSP. Although calculation of the Hansen distance was done using assumed parameters for lead iodide. More recently, the Hansen sphere of lead iodide was described using

        <p>Following EHS screening, remaining candidate solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (anhydrous solvents where possible, used as received) and 1 st generation precursor solutions were made by adding PbI 2 (∼580 mg) and MAI (∼200 mg) in 1 mL of candidate solvent by heating to 60 °C with stirring.

A 10 minutes UV-Ozone treatment was conducted prior to SnO 2 deposition with time between the UV-Ozone treatment and SnO 2 deposition minimised. Prior to coating, the spin-coater (in the class 6 environment), was wiped with deionised water to ensure higher humidity. 64 150 µL of tin oxide solution was spin coated onto substrates dynamically at 3000 rpm and 3000 acceleration for 30 seconds with solution dropped onto the sample after 5 seconds.

Samples were then placed on a hot plate at 60 °C and ramped rapidly to 100 °C for 10 minutes to anneal. For the candidate solutions, a prenucleation method of spin coating was used, harnessing the antisolvent drip stage during spin coating to induce the nucleation and crystallisation of the wet film. This method was used to form dense, pin hole free, specular films given the difference in solvent system properties to the control solution. It was thought that the standard control spin coating methodology leads to high defect levels if a transparent intermediate phase is formed from the candidate solutions due to over-coordination and poor solvent evacuation from the film.

        <p>Published procedures for the use of SnO 2 as an ETL on FTO recommend chemical bath deposition. 66 In this study the ETL was spun on FTO from a nanoparticle solution. It was postulated that due to the inherent surface roughness of the FTO (FTO having a root mean square value of 16 nm in comparison 0.63 nm for indium doped tin oxide (ITO) 67 ), the ETL exhibited poor surface coverage. This led to erratic open circuit voltage between pixels on the same sample. A recommendation is to use ITO in this build procedure when surface roughness cannot be altered by modification methods. As the lower cost indium-free alternative to ITO, FTO may still be used in this architecture provided that a consistent, pin hole free, tin oxide transport layer be deposited. In order to attain comparable results between devices/solvent systems all data was analysed and evaluated pixels with a recorded open circuit voltage below 0.85 V were omitted.Published procedures for the use of SnO 2 as an ETL on FTO recommend chemical bath deposition. 66 In this study the ETL was spun on FTO from a nanoparticle solution.

        <p>As these films were made in ambient conditions, the EA antisolvent drip timing was changed to 15s from the start of the cycle (from 7s) for the control with the 'prenucleation' strategy remaining as described. Absorptance and fluorescence measurements of thin films were made using an Edinburgh instruments FS5 spectrofluorometer, with the standard thin film sample holder; the integrating sphere unit was used to measure absorptance. Fluorescence (excitation wavelength of 450 nm) was measured using an integrating time of 0.2s and 3 nm excitation and emission slits. Measurements were taken on films in the absence of the transport layers and contact (i.e. FTO/MAPbI 3 /PMMA). This stack was manufactured in ambient conditions with the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA -Sigma Aldrich, average molecular weight ∼120 000 by GPC) layer spin coated onto the perovskite film to prevent environmental degradation during the measurement. PMMA (1 : 1 by weight with toluene) was deposited via spin coating at 3000 rpm (3000 acceleration) for 30 seconds, followed by a 3 minutes anneal at 70 °C. For consistency, samples were placed in the dark sample holder prior to measurement for 2 minutes. Three films per solution were evaluated with repeat measurements under constant illumination to mitigate the effect of photobrightening. 68 To achieve this, measurements were taken with a 2.5 minutes delay of light exposure between scans until the scans converged and were deemed 'stable' (see Fig. S6 † for candidate A solution multiple scan results). The uncorrected 'stable' scan for each sample was used when calculating the average data shown in Fig. 5 along with the standard deviation range from the mean shown by the shaded region. Absorptance scans were taken using the same sample architecture in the integrating sphere. Slit widths of 2.5 nm on the excitation and 0.25 nm on the emission were used for both the blank sphere scan and with the sample in the direct position. A synchronous scan was completed first on the blank sphere over the wavelength range 450-850 nm providing a baseline measurement. Subsequent to this, with the sample in the direct position within the sphere, a further synchronous scan was completed over the same range. It is worth noting that the slit widths should be set such that at the wavelength of the Xenon bulb (468 nm) the resulting emission doesn't saturate the detector. The fluoracle software can then be used combining the blank and direct position scan and providing analysis to attain reflectance and absorptance curves. The presented absorptance curves were attained through linear interpolation between the original data points, then smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay method with 6 points in window and a polynomial order of 3 (on OriginPro, 2020b).As these films were made in ambient conditions, the EA antisolvent drip timing was changed to 15s from the start of the cycle (from 7s) for the control with the 'prenucleation' strategy remaining as described.

        <p>The process of solvent selection is complicated by competing concerns relating to sustainability, health and safety, and cost; ultimately this relates to the viability of cost effective manufacture. Current theory suggests that competitively efficient perovskite films (ca. 25%) rely on strongly coordinating organic solvents. Conversely these solvents tend to grade low in terms of both sustainability and health and safety factors. Industrial manufacturing concerns may also alter the emphasis where solvent cost may be mitigated by effective solvent capture and reuse. However, where solvent capture is applied, large capital expenditure (CapEx) costs can be anticipated for more toxic chemicals. It is also worth noting that the cost of alternative solvents is much higher than traditional solvents (Table 3 and Table S1 †). Currently, this cost disparity becomes even greater at high volumes as traditional organic solvents have more developed production routes benefitting from economies of scale, whereas emerging solvents may have more complex synthesis, and are manufactured at smaller scale with higher associated costs. Considering the relative CapEx requirement, a low toxicity solvent system could end up a more cost effective option in the intermediate and longer term as the alternate solvent production routes develop and also benefit from economy of scale. Table 3 reports the 'greener' aprotic polar solvents i.e., those that scored 'problematic' or 'recommended' following EHS evaluation with the CHEM21 method, along with further a justification for their consideration for application in PSC production. Recent advances in the area of perovskite solvent impact include the analysis provided by Vidal et al., 2020. This research considers the health and environmental impact of several commonly used perovskite solvents in terms of both solvent production and energy demands alongside application of the 'USEtox' method to assess the wider health impact of each solvent. 69 This work highlights the importance of the comparatively benign organic solvent DMSO and underlines the toxicity concerns surrounding most other commonly used solvents including DMPU. These concerns are relative to the placement of DMF on the candidate list of substances of very high concern (SVHC) as part of the registration, evaluation, authorisation, and restriction of chemicals (REACH) initiative headed by the European Chemical Agency; 69 however, there is a clear need for comprehensive frameworks to aid in the design of genuinely green and low toxicity solvent systems that attain high PCE. Based on Hansen parameter evaluation (Table S2 †), several solvents were considered as promising candidates, creating a close position in Hansen space relative to the estimated HSP sphere of PbI 2 . Whilst none of the evaluated solvents provided a perfect match, the Hansen distance (HD) of DMSO is 6.7, the smallest evaluated distance.

        <p>Qualitative experimental data suggests that all three of these solvents are able to dissolve the lead iodide precursor in the presence of MAI, despite the low coordination number of GBL. This provides justification for continued use of DMSO as part of a cosolvating system. EHS solvent screening showed the newly developed solvent cyrene to be a possible dipolar aprotic replacement for DMF. However, our HD evaluation, along with that performed by Wang, et al. (2017), suggests that cyrene is relatively far away from lead iodide in Hansen space which may explain the poor performance of cyrene in generation 1 testing, with precursors precipitating out of solution. This is probably due to insufficient polarity and a comparatively low δ H valuerepresentative of hydrogen bonding affinity. A low δ H value is hypothesized to result from the hydrogen accepting ability of the CvO bond present within the cyrene molecule. The properties of the candidate solvent DMPU are not encouraging based upon this metric. Although the effective use of DMPU in cosolvent systems relies specifically upon its ability to coordinate the metal ion and form a complex, a major aspect of dissolution not accounted for in Hansen evaluation. However, Hansen solubility provides a useful benchmark showing the importance of polarity in relation to the lead iodide salt while pursuing a 'like dissolves like' approach to dissolution.Qualitative experimental data suggests that all three of these solvents are able to dissolve the lead iodide precursor in the presence of MAI, despite the low coordination number of GBL.

        <p>impacting effective MAPbI 3 precursor dissolution was used to define ideal parameters. The candidate solvents were therefore used in a second level of experimentation incorporating Gutmann donor number theory as a crucial parameter (Fig. 3). The donor number serves as a quantitative measure of Lewis basicity 71 and has been linked to coordination of the perovskite precursor 34 metal centre Pb 2+ . The challenges inherent to PbI 2 dissolution and coordination within a solvent system have been previously studied and were found to be independent of the counterion present 41 (methylammonium in this case). A reduction in the coordinating capacity of the solvent causes an increase in iodine ion concentration which in turn leads to iodoplumbate ion formation 72 . This behaviour enlightens the dissolution process and informs solvent selection further, as inhibition of these mechanisms by increasing the coordinating ability of the solvent may lead to customisation of resulting morphological effects. 34 DMPU was chosen as a major constituent, effectively replacing DMF, due to the high donor number, along with an adequate dielectric constantsimilar in magnitude to DMF. DMPU has previously been studied as a solvent additive with the observation that when used alone to dissolve the precursor materials the coordination of Pb 2+ leads to a precipitate forming at room temperature. 34 We report this finding through our own studies but found the effect mitigated by adding as little as 10 vol% of DMSO. In order to capitalise on the increased coordinating ability offered by DMPU, the coordination chemistry of the solvated Pb 2+ complex and the resulting colloidal configuration regarding the space demands of the solvent require further study. Studies suggest DMPU is a particularly space demanding solvent that coordinates lead in a holo-directed octahedral manner, whereas DMF preferentially coordinated in a hemi-directed configuration. 73 Fig. 4 shows a graphical representation combining the desired properties of high donicity and dielectric constant with the region of interest (ROI) highlighted for a DMSO/DMPU cosolvent system. In developing an alternative solvent system, we have utilised solvent characteristics ranging from the dielectric constant and HSP, the fluid properties of vapour pressure and boiling point, to the Gutmann donor number (D N ) and consideration of solvent space constraints and colloid configuration.impacting effective MAPbI 3 precursor dissolution was used to define ideal parameters.

        <p>Our initial solvent screening yielded several solvent candidates, including the promising highly coordinating solvents DMSO and DMPU. These solvent candidates were used alone and in combination in several stages of testing to ascertain their ability to dissolve MAPbI 3 precursors. Table 4 provides qualitative data evaluating four generations of cosolvent systems. DMPU, showed promise during 1 st generation testing, with 1 mL solutions completely dissolved at 1.25 M concentration. Dimethylimidazolidinone (DMI), a homolog of DMPU, was also evaluated with lower observable dissolution of the precursor materials along with a precipitate forming after time exposure. Cyrene (Table 3) was also considered for cosolvent testing due to its promise as a bioderived alternative to traditional dipolar protic solvents. The results for cyrene, 2-MeTHF, and propanenitrile were similar in that black crystalline precipitate formed indicative of MAPbI 3 perovskite. These solvents were then excluded from individual use due to an inability to coordinate the PbI 2 and prevent the 'crashing out' of perovskite crystals in solution. Based on the initial ability to dissolve the precursors in 1 st generation testing, 2 nd generation testing involved inhibiting the formation of a solid phase resulting from strong over-coordination of DMPU, 34 by addition of a cosolvent. Attempts were made to improve the prospect of using the green solvent cyrene through the addition of the highly polar and strongly coordinating solvent DMSO. However, this yielded no successful solutions. The 2 nd testing phase culminated in the manufacture of films and full devices where possible to ascertain which solvents combinations to pursue. 3 rd generation testing proceeded with the best performing systems of DMSO and DMPU from 2 nd generation testing, where a tertiary additive was selected to improve performance. Lower vapour pressure or boiling point additives were selected to balance the high boiling point and low vapour pressure of DMSO and DMPU, in alignment with the characteristics of the DMSO/DMF system. 4 th generation testing aimed to improve device PCE through ratio and miscibility tuning. The evaluation of these solvent systems is given in Table 4. From the trials 3 candidate solutions (A, B, and C) were selected for further analysis, each contain 40% DMSO where the % composition of DMPU, Me-THF and ethanol are varied. Multiple candidate solutions were formulated based on a core combination of DMSO and DMPU, an historic alternative dipolar aprotic solvent derived to replace hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) with a high coordination ability as defined on the Gutmann scale as 33 kcal mol -1 compared to 29.8 kcal mol -1 for DMSO and 26.6 kcal mol -1 for DMF. 74 Of the lower coordinating 'green' solvents 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) and ethanol (EtOH), 2-MeTHF can be biologically derived 75 and was selected for high vapour pressure; with EtOH added to improve the miscibility of 2-MeTHF with DMSO/DMPU whilst simultaneously increasing solution supersaturation.

        <p>Having successfully formed stable MAPbI 3 precursor solutions the optical and morphological characteristics of spin coated films were studied. Films manufactured from the 3 candidate solutions, show similar absorptance to the control (deposited from DMF/DMSO) with a very slight shift in the band gap position for films manufactured from candidates A and B (Fig. 5). This is less apparent in the photoluminescence spectra; all films show a similar maximum emission wavelength, with only ±1 nm between the average maximum emission wavelength of samples (from the measurements of 3 films per sample, see Fig. S11 †). Care is needed in assigning significant differences between these samples to these slight changes in band-gap and maximum emission wavelength, especially given the highly sensitive nature of the photoluminescence from perovskite samples in ambient conditions, 68 these slight differences are likely due to the differences in crystals size.Having successfully formed stable MAPbI 3 precursor solutions the optical and morphological characteristics of spin coated films were studied.

        <p>The three candidate films show slightly higher absorptance and significantly higher photoluminescent intensity, it is worth noting that the absorptance varies less between samples at the excitation wavelength for photoluminescence (PL) measurements (Fig. S7 †) and thus the higher PL is not only due to higher absorptance. Since these are thin-films (with no HTL present) and not full devices, higher PL is likely indicative of a lower defect concentration suggesting the candidate solution have produced higher quality films than the control. It is important to note that PL measurements are an average of 3 measurements or 3 films and so the candidate solutions produce films with higher PL consistently. Thicknesses of the films were measured via profilometry (Table S3 †) giving average values of 366, 487, 492 and 365 nm for the control and A, B, C films, respectively. Solvent systems A and B produce films which are approximately 25% thicker than the control or solvent system C, suggesting that the volume of 2-MeTHF directly affects the final film thickness. This could be due to the higher volatility of 2-MeTHF, which aids in the expedient removal of the solvent after coating. Despite the higher rotations per minute (rpm) during the coating process, candidate films A and B remain considerably thicker than their counterparts. The route of this appears to lie in the method of spin coating itself. In lieu of DMSO adduct intermediate phase formation, a 'prenucleation' method has been used for the candidate solvent systems. This leads to the formation of a phase of perovskite crystal during the spinning operation (light brown colour) with the subsequent annealing step precipitating 3D tetragonal MAPbI 3 from the solvent bound film above (as evidenced by XRD analysis).

        <p>SEM of the samples (Fig. 6, left) show both the control and candidate solutions produce a dense, pinhole free, highly compact perovskite film. A difference in spin coating antisolvent drip methodologies between the control and candidate solutions involves the formation of an intermediate phase as identified as a DMSO based adduct in the DMF/DMSO solution, by which the anti-solvent ethyl acetate (EA) removes the majority of the DMF and leaves a transparent adduct phase which upon annealing forms specular and large grain MAPbI 3 perovskite. This is suggested to be due to retardation of the crystallisation process favouring greater crystal growth over time. This is evidenced by the control sample which shows a specular film (by eye) with crystal domains visible with a mean average maximum Feret diameter of 346 ± 183 nm under 30 000× magnification. Films cast from candidate solutions give numerous oriented nucleation sites required for the formation of the compact film upon annealing. Due to this action directly impacting the growth phase of the crystallisation, the crystal size visible for candidate solution films appears smaller. Solvent systems A and C produce films with crystal sizes of 267 ± 106 nm and 264 ± 112 nm respectively whereas candidate B shows more comparable average crystal size to the control sample with 304 ± 108 nm.SEM of the samples (Fig. 6, left) show both the control and candidate solutions produce a dense, pinhole free, highly compact perovskite film.

        <p>All candidate solutions also exhibit two prominent peaks and a smaller tertiary peak below 10°. These were identified at 5.8°, 6.5°, and 8.1°respectively. This may be due to the presence of 2D perovskite phases; the use of specific solvents and solvent additives has been reported to produce 2D lattice structures classified by the number of lattice layers n. 78 The most likely region for any 2D perovskite growth would be the ETL/ PAL interface, due to the spin coating procedure. As the incidence angle is very acute, it remains unlikely that we have identified 2D MAPbI 3 perovskite during these XRD scans of 400-500 nm thick samples. Another possible explanation for the observed low angle (&lt;10°) peaks is the presence of solvated phases within the sample. This could be due to an insufficient annealing step, or residual solvent present within the bulk. Although identification of the exact peak position is difficult to match, recent studiesalso applying a prenucleation style of dripidentify three low angle peaks as MA 2 Pb 3 I 8 •2DMSO. 79 The XRD position reported here is shifted to the left by ∼1°c ompared to that presented by Zhang et al., 2020. However, the relative position and intensity of the three peaks show good agreement. 79 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks were measured (Table S4 †) with the DMF/DMSO control providing the baseline for a high quality film. Candidate A, B and the DMF/DMSO sample all show similar FWHM values for the 110 peak (ca. 0.09). For both the 220 and 310 peaks the FWHM for candidate A is the lowest of all samples. This, along with the higher PL intensity observed suggests higher crystallinity within the material. This is postulated to be the result of reduced impurities resulting from the use of the prenucleation method with this sample. The intensity of the 110 peak shows a higher intensity in all of the candidate solutions (order of precedence A-B-C-Control) compared to the control, with candidate C showing largest FWHM and consequently the poorest crystallinity, again this agrees with the PL measurements with C producing lower PL intensity compared to A and B. In terms of peak intensity, the 310 peak is noticeably lower relative to the 110 and 220 peaks in the candidate films compared to the DMF/DMSO film. Table S4 † shows the 110/310 peak intensity ratio for each solvent system. All candidate solutions show a higher ratio suggesting 110 orientation is dominant.

        <p>Candidate A in particular matches the performance of the DMF/DMSO system extremely well with the champion devices achieving over 16% PCE matching the champion devices of DMF/DMSO (the J-V curves for all champion devices are given in Fig. S8 †). For average values Candidates B and C produce overall similar PCE values with slightly lower J SC values which may be due to slightly less uniform films as suggested by the XRD and in the case of Candidate C, lower PL intensity. Candidates B and C also didn't produce as high efficiency champion devices compared to Candidate A and the control DMF/DMSO, although this may just be a case of needing further refinement of the spin coating cycle and anti-solvent drip. Specifically, the addition of increased amounts of EtOH in candidate B and DMPU in candidate C subsequently serves to increase solution supersaturation and reduce film evacuation respectively, both parameters expected to impact deposition. Based on all the evidence available to us, it seems apparent that Candidate A is the most promising, but B and C could potentially be improved further and the ability to tune the solvent composition without significantly effecting device performance could be extremely valuable to optimising the solvent system to various printing techniques. As an example, candidate solution C could be chosen for experimentation with excess PbI 2 , a common strategy to increase device PCE, as it has the highest % of DMSO/DMPU (total 80%); by tuning the ratio to include more DMPU and less 2-MeTHF and EtOH blend, the solvating power of the solution is increased potentially allowing increased concentrations of PbI 2 .Candidate A in particular matches the performance of the DMF/DMSO system extremely well with the champion devices achieving over 16% PCE matching the champion devices of DMF/DMSO (the J-V curves for all champion devices are given in Fig. S8 †).

        <p>In this work we have identified a solvent system consisting of DMSO, DMPU, 2-MeTHF and EtOH that is capable of matching the performance of the commonly used DMF/DMSO solvent system for deposition of MAPbI 3 . We have shown there is a degree of flexibility in the composition of this solvent system by studying three candidate solutions (A-C), with slightly different compositions of the four constituent solvents, that all achieve similar device performance to the control 'Hero' devices produced PCE values of 16.2, 16.1, 13.3, and 13.9% for when DMF/DMSO and A-C are used to deposit MAPbI 3 respectively. XRD and SEM confirm that the solvent systems produce dense, crystalline, and uniform films with no observable pin-holes. We have highlighted and demonstrated the methodology for green solvent substitution which we hope will act as a framework to support further development of greener and more sustainable solvent systems for PSC manufacturing and hasten the commercialisation of this technology. We have investigated commercially available solvents and used benchmarks of basicity as represented through the Gutmann donor number, and dielectric constant to identify solvents likely to dissolve MAPbI 3 perovskite precursors (MAI and PbI 2 ). Two dipolar aprotic solvents DMSO and DMPU were identified as a cosolvent system capable of forming high (1.25 M) concentration solutions suitable for spin coating. Emphasis was also placed on the increased Pb 2+ coordinating ability of the DMSO/DMPU system to produce highly crystalline planar perovskite films. An additive cosolvent system comprising the derived 'green' solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and ethanol helped to mitigate over coordination improving film quality and ease of spin coating. A prenucleation style of anti-solvent drip was utilised with a MAPbI 3 crystalline film forming during the spin coating process and providing a dense spread of nucleation sites for further temperature induced crystal growth from the solvated phase. Our results suggest that this solvent system results in efficient, compact films with superior fluorescence emission and improved crystallinity compared to the highly optimised DMF/DMSO cosolvent system. Solvent systems A-C produced films with significantly higher fluorescence emission compared to the DMF/DMSO system, with A and B showing the highest fluorescence intensity likely due to the higher volume % of 2-MeTHF (20 and 15% respectively) resulting in slightly thicker films (487 and 492 nm respectively vs. 366 nm for DMF/DMSO) while retaining higher crystallinity and uniformity as evidenced by SEM observations. While the 3 candidate solutions presented here have similar compositions, we feel that analysis of these systems highlights the potential for customisable solvent system to alter crystallinity, reduce defects, and tune the properties of the perovskite film and could potentially be optimised for a given manufacturing method. We have used environmental, health and safety considerations (EHS) of the solvents as the first step in screening potentially 'greener' solvents producing a system significantly better than DMF/DMSO in terms of the EHS credentials. Moving forward, thorough techno-economic evaluation and extended lifecycle assessment methodologies should be undertaken to verify that solvent substitution results in reduced environmental impacts throughout the whole lifecycle of PSC devices and no unintended consequences occur from adoption of alternative solvent systems.In this work we have identified a solvent system consisting of DMSO, DMPU, 2-MeTHF and EtOH that is capable of matching the performance of the commonly used DMF/DMSO solvent system for deposition of MAPbI 3 .
