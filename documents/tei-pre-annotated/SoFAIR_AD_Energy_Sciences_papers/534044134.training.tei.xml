        <p>The Paris climate goals and the Glasgow Climate Pact require anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions to decline to net zero by mid-century. This will require overcoming carbon lock-in throughout the energy system. Previous studies have focused on 'committed emissions' from capital investments in energy-consuming infrastructure, or potential (committed and uncommitted) emissions from fossil fuel reserves. Here we make the first bottom-up assessment of committed CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel-producing infrastructure, defined as existing and under-construction oil and gas fields and coal mines. We use a commercial model of the world's 25 000 oil and gas fields and build a new dataset on coal mines in the nine largest coal-producing countries. Our central estimate of committed emissions is 936 Gt CO 2 , comprising 47% from coal, 35% from oil and 18% from gas. We find that staying within a 1.5 • C carbon budget (50% probability) implies leaving almost 40% of 'developed reserves' of fossil fuels unextracted. The finding that developed reserves substantially exceed the 1.5 • C carbon budget is robust to a Monte Carlo analysis of reserves data limitations, carbon budget uncertainties and oil prices. This study contributes to growing scholarship on the relevance of fossil fuel supply to climate mitigation. Going beyond recent warnings by the International Energy Agency, our results suggest that staying below 1.5 • C may require governments and companies not only to cease licensing and development of new fields and mines, but also to prematurely decommission a significant portion of those already developed.The Paris climate goals and the Glasgow Climate Pact require anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions to decline to net zero by mid-century.

        <p>Various sources of inertia, or carbon lock-in, in energy systems hinder a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels (Unruh 2000, Seto et al 2016). Long-lived capital stocks, such as power plants, factories, buildings and vehicles, will continue to emit CO 2 during their expected economic lifetime unless they are retrofitted or decommissioned prematurely (Fisch-Romito et al 2021). Previous studies have calculated the cumulative 'committed emissions' (Davis et al 2010, Davis andSocolow 2014) of capital stocks of energyconsuming infrastructure (Pfeiffer et al 2018, Smith et al 2019, IEA 2020a), with Tong et al (2019) finding that they exceed the remaining 1.5 • C carbon budget.Various sources of inertia, or carbon lock-in, in energy systems hinder a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels (Unruh 2000, Seto et al 2016).

        <p>Here we conduct the first assessment of committed emissions from the portion of fossil fuel reserves within actively producing or under-construction oil and gas fields and coal mines, which we call 'developed reserves' . Reserves are the quantity of fossil fuel deposits that have been discovered (geologically assessed) and that can be commercially extracted under anticipated economic conditions (figure 1). While several previous studies have assessed total reserves in relation to carbon budgets (Meinshausen et al 2009, McGlade and Ekins 2015, Welsby et al 2021), no study has yet focused on the subset of reserves that is already developed and, therefore, 'locked-in' by past development decisions (unless those decisions are reversed).Here we conduct the first assessment of committed emissions from the portion of fossil fuel reserves within actively producing or under-construction oil and gas fields and coal mines, which we call 'developed reserves' .

        <p>Developed reserves are particularly relevant to climate policy because they reflect the cumulative quantity of oil, gas and coal that companies have already discovered and for which a financial and regulatory commitment to extraction has been made. If cumulative potential CO 2 emissions from developed reserves exceed the remaining carbon budgets to limit warming to 1.5 • C or well below 2 • C, this would imply that governments licensing and companies exploring for and developing new fossil fuel reserves is inconsistent with the Paris goals. Furthermore, some existing licences and production, or unabated use, would need to be halted to safely achieve the goals, causing stranded assets. The International Energy Agency (IEA) (IEA 2021) recently elevated the issue of fossil fuel supply in policy debates by finding that new oil and gas fields and coal mines are not needed under its 1.5 • C-aligned 'net zero by 2050' scenario. We interrogate a complementary question: To what extent do existing oil and gas fields and coal mines hold more reserves than we need or can burn under Paris temperature limits?Developed reserves are particularly relevant to climate policy because they reflect the cumulative quantity of oil, gas and coal that companies have already discovered and for which a financial and regulatory commitment to extraction has been made.

        <p>The most widely used reserves estimates rely on government reporting, which is subject to inconsistent standards and definitions (most importantly regarding economic viability) and to incentives to overreport, as seen with Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 'political reserves' (McGlade 2012) (supplementary text). We consider only those reserves within projects for which a final investment decision (FID) has been made, which is when the largest portion of capital is committed. This subset of reserves can be consistently defined and evaluated.The most widely used reserves estimates rely on government reporting, which is subject to inconsistent standards and definitions (most importantly regarding economic viability) and to incentives to overreport, as seen with Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 'political reserves' (McGlade 2012) (supplementary text).

        <p>We estimate developed reserves as at the start of 2018 (excluding subsequent discoveries or depletion). Our oil and gas estimates reflect the probabilistic mean (expectation) of future extraction from developed projects. This is the amount most likely to be extracted over the projects' lives, when aggregated across all projects. Coal reserves tend not to be considered probabilistically. We estimate proven plus probable coal reserves under the definitions of the Combined Reserves International Reporting Standards Committee (CRIRSCO 2019).We estimate developed reserves as at the start of 2018 (excluding subsequent discoveries or depletion).

        <p>To estimate developed oil and gas reserves, we use Rystad Energy's UCube (Rystad 2020), a commercial bottom-up model. The UCube models the investment and operating decisions of 65 000 fields globally (of which around 25 000 are producing or under construction) based on their geology, costs and projected rates of return. Oil and gas prices are exogenous assumptions in the model; our base case uses an oil price projection of USD 60 per barrel (bbl) (supplementary methods 2).To estimate developed oil and gas reserves, we use Rystad Energy's UCube (Rystad 2020), a commercial bottom-up model.

        <p>It is commonly observed that bottom-up reserves data provided commercially to the oil and gas industry is more reliable than freely available and widely used sources (Speirs andSorrell 2009, McGlade 2014), which have been characterised as 'inaccurate, inconsistent, uncertain and/or contested' (Thompson et al 2009) (supplementary text). Rystad's commercial model incorporates a consistent, independent, expert assessment of economic viability (vital to the concept of reserves) and is updated regularly (supplementary methods 2). Other peerreviewed studies of oil and gas (Erickson et al 2017, Mercure et al 2021) and the IEA (2020b) use Rystad's data and modelling.It is commonly observed that bottom-up reserves data provided commercially to the oil and gas industry is more reliable than freely available and widely used sources (Speirs andSorrell 2009, McGlade 2014), which have been characterised as 'inaccurate, inconsistent, uncertain and/or contested' (Thompson et al 2009) (supplementary text).

        <p>We include under-construction conventional oil and gas projects that have received an FID. In contrast, unconventional shale oil and gas production has two main 'commitment' points: to develop an area (installing infrastructure) and to proceed with wells within it. While either approach could be justified, we conservatively count only those shale reserves accessed by already-drilled wells.We include under-construction conventional oil and gas projects that have received an FID.

        <p>Since coal reserves data are often of relatively poor quality (Zittel and Schindler 2007), we compile a new dataset for the largest coal-producing countries (Trout et al 2022).

        <p>For China, responsible for 45% of global coal production (BGR 2019), we sample close to 300 mines and use a regression analysis to estimate the reserves of the full population of mines (figure 2). For India, the United States, Indonesia, Australia, South Africa and Poland, together representing 37% of global production (BGR 2019), our study collects minelevel data from company financial reporting, government regulatory data and industry data publications (supplementary methods 5). For Russia and Germany (8% of global production), we derive top-down estimates from government and industry sources, respectively (Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment 2019, DEBRIV 2019). For countries accounting for the remaining 10% of world coal production, we estimate developed reserves as equal to current annual production multiplied by the median ratio of developed reserves to production across our nine studied countries (Mendelevitch 2018).For China, responsible for 45% of global coal production (BGR 2019), we sample close to 300 mines and use a regression analysis to estimate the reserves of the full population of mines (figure 2).

        <p>While coal reserves reporting is increasingly being standardised via CRIRSCO, legacy classification systems persist in China, Russia and India, which reflect technical but not necessarily economic extractability (Thomas 2013). For China, we apply an adjustment factor of 0.57 (interquartile range 0.29, 0.83) based on a sample of 30 mines that state reserves under both Chinese and CRIRSCO standards; for Russia we use a defined subset of reserves reported under the Russian system and set wide uncertainty bands; for India, we control reserves estimates against remaining mine life and mine capacity, while setting wide uncertainty bands (supplementary methods 4 and 5).While coal reserves reporting is increasingly being standardised via CRIRSCO, legacy classification systems persist in China, Russia and India, which reflect technical but not necessarily economic extractability (Thomas 2013).

        <p>The purpose of committed CO 2 emissions accounting (Davis et al 2010, Davis and Socolow 2014) is to quantify future cumulative emissions implied by existing capital investments at one part of the energy system-in our case, extraction facilities. For fossil fuel-burning infrastructure, key variables are expected operational lifetime and, in the case of power plants, capacity factor (Davis and Socolow 2014, Tong et al 2019). For fossil fuel extraction facilities, the key constraining variable is the volume of reserves that can be economically extracted. If all committed reserves are extracted, the resulting CO 2 emissions would be largely unaffected by where or how they are burned (IPCC 2006).

        <p>Developed oil and gas reserves together exhaust more than four fifths of the 1.5 • C budget. The remaining one fifth is equivalent to just 6 years of coal production at present rates. Assuming such rapid closure of coal mines is not feasible, some developed oil and gas reserves, alongside coal, would need to be kept in the ground.Developed oil and gas reserves together exhaust more than four fifths of the 1.5 • C budget.

        <p>There are substantial inherent uncertainties in any reserves estimate in relation to consistency in reporting standards, geological uncertainty and future economic viability (McGlade 2012) (supplementary methods 1). Our estimates of committed emissions are subject to further uncertainty related to reserves' energy and carbon content and net carbon storage in non-energy uses (supplementary methods 2-6).There are substantial inherent uncertainties in any reserves estimate in relation to consistency in reporting standards, geological uncertainty and future economic viability (McGlade 2012) (supplementary methods 1).

        <p>We assess the combined effect of such uncertainties by performing a 1000-run Monte Carlo simulation. Figure 4 displays the probability distribution of committed emissions results by fuel for the most significant countries.

        <p>We do not find significant variation in results beyond 1000 runs, whilst results remain robust when uncertainties in reserves data are doubled: the mean outcome for developed reserves and committed emissions does not change significantly. For countries with more uncertain parameters, reflected in wider probability ranges (e.g. Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq), doubling the uncertainty level increases the 90th percentile range for reserves and emissions by more than 25% (supplementary methods 6; figure S4).We do not find significant variation in results beyond 1000 runs, whilst results remain robust when uncertainties in reserves data are doubled: the mean outcome for developed reserves and committed emissions does not change significantly.

        <p>Uncertainties may be larger than we capture because we assume they are uncorrelated. Correlations might arise, for example, from systemic biases in project-level reserves estimation by particular companies, or from effects of national regulatory regimes for reporting reserves.

        <p>There are larger uncertainties in remaining carbon budgets. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report cites 380-980 Gt CO 2 as the 66% confidence interval for staying within 1.5 • C, accounting for uncertainty in the climate response to cumulative CO 2 emissions (Canadell et al 2021). Our finding that global committed CO 2 from developed reserves exhausts the 1.5 • C budget is robust to that range. The 66% confidence interval for staying within 2 • C is considerably wider, 980-2380 Gt CO 2 . Given the Paris Agreement commits to staying 'well below' 2 • C, we interpret the budget that provides the highest certainty (83%) of staying below that limit as most consistent with the Agreement's aims.There are larger uncertainties in remaining carbon budgets.

        <p>This study also does not consider non-energy CO 2 emissions from land use and cement manufacturing, which leave less room in remaining carbon budgets for fossil fuels, nor does it factor in carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which could create more room (Rogelj et al 2018). Keeping cumulative fossil fuelrelated CO 2 emissions well within maximum carbon budgets would be the most precautionary approach to avoid overshoot of either 1.5 • C or 2 • C. Cement process emissions are particularly hard to abate, while cement is a vital construction material (IEA 2020a).This study also does not consider non-energy CO 2 emissions from land use and cement manufacturing, which leave less room in remaining carbon budgets for fossil fuels, nor does it factor in carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which could create more room (Rogelj et al 2018).

        <p>Most integrated assessment models assume land-use emissions will be negative by mid-century (Rogelj et al 2018), yet they are still positive and climate change impacts threaten the long-term ability of trees to sequester carbon (Anderegg et al 2020). Technologies to capture and store carbon could reduce the current CO 2 emission rate of fossil fuel combustion, but not eliminate it, while CDR technologies carry inherent risks, being unproven at scale (Larkin et al 2018). One reason our study reaches a stronger conclusion than the IEA (2021) finding that no additional fields and mines are needed is that the IEA scenario includes some CDR and significant carbon capture and storage (CCS) of fossil fuel emissions. The IEA acknowledges that CCS availability is one of the greatest uncertainties in its scenario; three decades of efforts to deploy CCS have largely failed (Wang et al 2021).Most integrated assessment models assume land-use emissions will be negative by mid-century (Rogelj et al 2018), yet they are still positive and climate change impacts threaten the long-term ability of trees to sequester carbon (Anderegg et al 2020).

        <p>The UCube model enables us to separately test the sensitivity of developed oil and gas reserves to future price assumptions. Whereas around 80% of global coal production is consumed in the country where it is extracted (BP 2019), and thus sensitive primarily to national market and political conditions, oil and (to some extent) gas are traded on a global market and price can be introduced as a global variable. Our central estimate is based on a long-term Brent oil price of USD 60/bbl ($2020). A high long-term oil price of USD 80/bbl ($2020) increases estimates of commercially viable developed oil and gas reserves by 2%, while a low case of USD 30/bbl $2020) decreases estimates by 22% for oil and 16% for gas (table S5). In the low-oil-price scenario, committed CO 2 from oil and gas falls to 390 Gt. But, including coal, committed emissions from developed fields and mines would still exceed the 1.5 • C budget (50%). Tong et al (2019) have previously shown that the world has passed a point beyond which any new fossil fuel-burning infrastructure can be built without either exceeding 1.5 • C or forcing early retirement or underutilization of some existing infrastructure. Our study offers insight on the global scale of emissions 'commitment' at the opposite side of the energy system-the fields and mines that supply fossil fuels. Our findings indicate that emissions committed by developed extraction facilities exceed those committed by existing combustion infrastructure (figure 5). In either case, committed emissions are not inevitable (Davis and Sokolow 2014). But avoiding them will require overcoming financial, political and legal inertia created by sunk investments and previous policy decisions.The UCube model enables us to separately test the sensitivity of developed oil and gas reserves to future price assumptions.

        <p>Based on our median estimate, almost 40% of developed reserves cannot be burned (or must be abated) to stay within the 1.5 • C budget (50%). This goes beyond the IEA (2021) finding that new oil and gas fields are not needed in a 1.5 • C scenario. Our findings suggest that, absent large-scale CDR, a significant portion of existing fields and mines must be decommissioned before their reserves are depleted, stranding not only some of their carbon but also invested capital. The question of which developed coal, oil and gas reserves should be decommissioned and which 'fit' within the 1.5 • C carbon budget is one that goes beyond this study's scope. It requires considerations of equity and of the best mechanisms to manage a just transition away from fossil fuel jobs and revenues within and between countries (Muttitt andKartha 2020, Pye et al 2020).Based on our median estimate, almost 40% of developed reserves cannot be burned (or must be abated) to stay within the 1.5 • C budget (50%).

        <p>By extending the implication of our results to 2 • C scenarios, we also find that the world is very close to a 'point of no return' past which no new fields and mines can be developed without jeopardising the well below 2 • C limit, unless an equivalent or greater amount of carbon already under production is stranded or sequestered (Allen et al 2009).By extending the implication of our results to 2 • C scenarios, we also find that the world is very close to a 'point of no return' past which no new fields and mines can be developed without jeopardising the well below 2 • C limit, unless an equivalent or greater amount of carbon already under production is stranded or sequestered (Allen et al 2009).</p>
        <p>Our study takes a different approach from that of Welsby et al (2021) and McGlade and Ekins (2015), who consider a broader scope of reserves. They use cost-optimising models to assess what portion of coal, oil and gas reserves-developed and undeveloped-may be unextractable under 1.5 • C or 2 • C carbon budgets. They assume some lowercost undeveloped reserves displace (or shut in) some higher-cost developed reserves. The novel contribution of our study is to apply the concept of committed emissions to reserves, recognizing that carbon lockin reduces the price sensitivity of developed reserves (Seto et al 2016).Our study takes a different approach from that of Welsby et al (2021) and McGlade and Ekins (2015), who consider a broader scope of reserves.

        <p>Conventionally, climate policy addresses demand for fossil fuels (Green and Denniss 2018), which is expected to translate to supply via markets and the price mechanism. Fluctuations in price have a significant influence over FIDs to develop new projects. However, once capital is committed through an FID, companies are incentivised to keep producing to recoup that capital, as long as the prevailing market price exceeds marginal operating costs (Erickson 2015). This form of carbon lock-in accounts for the limited price sensitivity of developed reserves observed in section 3.Conventionally, climate policy addresses demand for fossil fuels (Green and Denniss 2018), which is expected to translate to supply via markets and the price mechanism.

        <p>The policy implications of committed CO 2 emissions from developed reserves exceeding the 1.5 • C carbon budget are twofold: (a) all undeveloped reserves may be considered unextractable; and (b) constraining production of already developed coal, oil and gas reserves within 1.5 • C is likely to require policy interventions beyond price signals.The policy implications of committed CO 2 emissions from developed reserves exceeding the 1.5 • C carbon budget are twofold: (a) all undeveloped reserves may be considered unextractable; and (b) constraining production of already developed coal, oil and gas reserves within 1.5 • C is likely to require policy interventions beyond price signals.</p>
        <p>Continued licensing and development of reserves will either push the world further beyond climate limits (if fully extracted) or increase the scale of stranded assets (i.e. unrecouped capital investment) from early closure of extraction projects (IEA 2021). New development also deepens political entanglement with the fossil fuel industry, increasing the scale of extractionrelated jobs and investments governments face pressure to protect, for example, through subsidies to sustain otherwise uneconomic projects (Newell and Johnstone 2018).Continued licensing and development of reserves will either push the world further beyond climate limits (if fully extracted) or increase the scale of stranded assets (i.e. unrecouped capital investment) from early closure of extraction projects (IEA 2021).

        <p>The most direct way for governments to prevent additional development of reserves would be to stop issuing new licences or permits for their exploration or extraction. Governments could thereby not only minimise stranded assets but also avoid further entrenching legal and political barriers to mitigation policies. For example, once reserves are licensed to companies, those companies may sue to protect their investments from policy changes under international treaties such as the Energy Charter Treaty (Tienhaara and Downie 2018). It is important to note that the resources contained within already issued licences exceed the reserves that have been discovered, which in turn exceed the developed reserves we examine.

        <p>This study contributes to growing scholarship on the relevance of fossil fuel supply to climate mitigation (Green and Denniss 2018, Asheim et al 2019, Piggott et al 2020). We find that developed reserves of oil, gas and coal significantly exceed what can be extracted and burned within the 1.5 • C budget, a conclusion that is robust to uncertainties in reserves and carbon budgets. Developing new fields and mines would jeopardise the well below 2 • C limit; nearly 40% of committed emissions from existing reserves must be avoided to stay below 1.5 • C. This implies a policy need not only to end new upstream fossil fuel licensing and development, thereby limiting further carbon lock-in, but also to revoke some existing licences and prematurely close some already producing fields and mines. Given a rapidly closing window to keep warming below 1.5 • C, these findings call for urgent policy attention on managing an orderly and equitable phase-out of fossil fuel extraction.This study contributes to growing scholarship on the relevance of fossil fuel supply to climate mitigation (Green and Denniss 2018, Asheim et al 2019, Piggott et al 2020).
