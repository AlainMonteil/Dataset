        <p>Several investigations have been done on solar energy in the past years. The utilization of fossil fuels will be restricted due to fewer resources as well as environmental concerns. Researchers are looking for other possible energy sources because of these concerns. The principal attention for energy-saving in thermal collectors is an improvement in heat transfer performance. Solar thermal energy has been widely employed for power generation, chemical processing, and thermal heating applications because of its sustainable nature and fewer emissions [1,2].Several investigations have been done on solar energy in the past years.

        <p>Heating and cooling of common fluids such as water, ethylene glycol (EG), and oil are regarded as critical challenges for heat transfer applications including, power production, transportation and generation, chemical methods, and many more but due to its low thermal conductivity, affecting heat flux mechanisms, such as cooling [3], material handling and solar thermal collectors [4,5]. Because of the suitable properties of EG, it is used for heat transfer applications such as HVAC devices and solar collectors as well as internal combustion engines. By enhancing the heat transfer rate, the processing time will be reduced for industrial applications and developments in energy savings will be improved [6]. To develop the progress in thermal conductivity for conventional fluids, Choi [7] in 1995 introduced nanofluids by suspending nano-sized metallic and non-metallic particles (1-100 nm) in the base fluid.Heating and cooling of common fluids such as water, ethylene glycol (EG), and oil are regarded as critical challenges for heat transfer applications including, power production, transportation and generation, chemical methods, and many more but due to its low thermal conductivity, affecting heat flux mechanisms, such as cooling [3], material handling and solar thermal collectors [4,5].

        <p>Different nanofluids have been developed by many researchers for effective heat transfer performance of various metals and metal oxides [8]. The characteristics of nanomaterials affect the increased surface area and quantum effects, which change physical, chemical, optical, mechanical and electrical properties behavior [9]. Nanofluids exhibit high thermal properties, long-term stability, minimum aggregation, low pumping power, and homogeneity because of nanoparticles small size and large surface area and investigated in various applications [10,11]. The preparation of stable nanofluids is important and most investigators have focused on nanofluids stability with no decisive conclusions [12]. Many investigations have been conducted by scholars on nanofluids thermophysical characteristics and stability [13][14][15], but it J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f is inadequate. So, more research is required to study the consequences and mechanisms of different parameters on nanofluids.Different nanofluids have been developed by many researchers for effective heat transfer performance of various metals and metal oxides [8].

        <p>Mono nanoparticles due to its large surface energy and specific area are prone to reunite and therefore result in sedimentation when dispersed in the base fluid [16], which shifted the focus of the research community towards hybrid nanofluids. Hybrid nanofluids were introduced in the last few years to surpass some challenges that affect the performance of nanofluids [17]. Nanocomposite materials comprised of two or more nanomaterials suspended in the base fluids for the preparation of nanofluids, and it is considered an essential feature of the fastest-growing areas in nanotechnology. The researchers in the areas of engineering and materials science are paying more attention to hybrid nanofluids. This leads to fluids having adjusted properties with a trade-off between the properties of individual nanoparticles used to make a hybrid. In some cases, nanofluids of hybrid nanoparticles show better stability and thermophysical properties as with single nanoparticles. Hence, hybrid nanofluids are having a higher edge than mono nanofluids. As an example, ceramic materials such as Alumina has excellent stability and chemical inertness, which are some of the excellent properties it has but shows a lower thermal conductivity when compared to metallic nanoparticles. However, reactivity and stability are two crucial factors that should be considered for nanofluid applications [18]. These hybrids include various kinds of nanoparticle, several base fluids, or nanocomposites [19][20][21]. The accurate knowledge of thermophysical characteristics is essential to estimate the thermal system performance operating with nanofluids. These characteristics are entirely dependent on nanoparticle concentration suspended and consistently dispersed in the base fluids. The stable hybrid nanofluids have developed enhanced thermal conductivity and significant results in renewable energy, capacity, and a decrease in the cost of the thermal system due to an increase in thermal systems efficiency in addition to the reduction in hazardous emissions [22]. Suresh et al. [23,24] examined improvement in thermal conductivity by preparing Al 2 O 3 -Cu hybrid nanofluids and computed the convective heat transfer for Al 2 O 3 -Cu nanofluid and about 14% heat transfer improvement was observed. Nine et al. [25] prepared Al 2 O 3 -MWCNTs hybrid nanofluids and analyzed their thermal properties for 1-6% particle loading concentrations. Madhesh et al. [26] observed the overall J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f heat transfer coefficient of copper-titania nanocomposite, and it was seen to be improved for different volume concentrations by more than 50%.Mono nanoparticles due to its large surface energy and specific area are prone to reunite and therefore result in sedimentation when dispersed in the base fluid [16], which shifted the focus of the research community towards hybrid nanofluids.

        <p>Researchers have focused on properties of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) nanofluids, have attracted attention because of the wide range of purposes in the energy disciplines such as CO 2 capture [27] and thermal absorption systems and employed for direct absorption in collectors for solar radiation [28]. Wide-ranging photon absorption cross-section, and powerful intermolecular bonds, economical, and environmentally friendly are the main characteristics of Fe 3 O 4 . Fertman et al. [29] studied hydrocarbon-based magnetic fluids, including colloidal Fe 3 O 4 particles with an oleic acid coating of 0.01% to 0.2% and observed thermal conductivity from 20 to 80℃. Another research by Gavali et al. [30] analyzed Fe 3 O 4 /water nanofluids with a 10 nm particle size and showed thermal conductivity improvement of about 200% at a volume concentration of 5%. There are still some difficulties in practicing Fe 3 O 4 as it agglomerates easily in water and has poor dispersion for photo-thermal energy conversion. That is because of the large surface to volume ratio and the strong dipole-dipole interface between the nanoparticles [31].Researchers have focused on properties of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) nanofluids, have attracted attention because of the wide range of purposes in the energy disciplines such as CO 2 capture [27] and thermal absorption systems and employed for direct absorption in collectors for solar radiation [28].

        <p>Graphene introduces as a unique class of carbon nanomaterials. It shows quite favorable characteristics, outstanding mechanical strength, surface area with high electrical conductivity. It has been an excellent material to improve chemical, physical, and mechanical properties in various applications [32]. Graphene sheets are studied by many investigators to improve the heat transfer attributes of water-based fluids [33][34][35]. Novoselov and co-workers recognized it in 2004 as a family of a 2D carbon monolayer packed into a honeycomb structure that was considered to be a building block for carbonaceous materials such as graphite and carbon nanotubes [36,37]. In recent years, several publications have grown continuously addressing the application of graphene in electrochemical energystorage mechanisms such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, electrochemical capacitors, and many more. Techniques such as mechanical exfoliation [37], SiC synthesis [38], and bottom-up synthesis from specified organic precursors [39], inevitably reduce the graphene usage to significant research and applications, because of the restricted scalability and costly production expenses. Similarly, a wellestablished procedure in production is the deposition of hydrocarbons by chemical vapor [38], which is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f not appropriate for storing electrochemical energy on an extensive scale production of graphene [39]. The deposition of chemical vapor has been described as an effective approach to assemble vertically oriented graphene nanosheets [40], besides the low packing density of the graphene [41]. Graphene oxide needs to reduce chemically, thermally, electromechanically processes to restore the π system, which is the quality for conductive graphene [42,43]. Graphene oxide-iron oxide (GO-Fe 3 O 4 ) nanocomposites have been prepared into GO sheets in basic solution by co-precipitating iron salts. Chandra et al. [44] [45]. Said et al. [4] investigated the stability and thermophysical properties of CNF, FCNF, rGO, and rGO coated over F-CNF (F-CNF/rGO) and the most stable sample was observed to be F-CNF/rGO showing zeta potential value of -45 mV and -33.4 mV on the 1st and 180th day respectively, without agglomeration. The Fe 3 O 4 /CRG nanocomposite was synthesized through the reduction of Fe 3 O 4 /GO by Gao et al. [46] by heating aqueous solutions of FeCl 3 , GO, NaOH, and diethylene glycol at a temperature of 22 o C. The analytic modeling of chemically reduced graphene CRG and Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles is observed [47,48]. Also, the mechanical milling of graphite oxide and Fe(acac) 3 mixture [49] are employed by fabricating Fe 3 O 4 /CRG nanocomposites. The low affinity of iron oxide nanoparticles is due to the reduction in binding positions for Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles on the exposed surface of graphene.Graphene introduces as a unique class of carbon nanomaterials.

        <p>To examine thermal conductivity, the preparation of nanocomposites at different concentrations was performed. A thermal conductivity analyzer (Decagon KD2 Pro, ±5%) that works with the technique of transient hot-wire method (THW) based on the ASTM D7896 standard [62] is used to measure the thermal conductivity of produced rGO-Fe 3 O 4 -TiO 2 hybrid nanofluids at 25 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C. The calibration of the sensor needle (KS-1, which is in the range of 0.2-2 W/mK with an accuracy of ±5%.) was carried out first by measuring the thermal conductivity of distilled water and glycerin. The measured values for distilled water and glycerin were 0.611 and 0.292 W/mK, respectively, which agree J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with the literature values of 0.613 and 0.285 W/mK respectively within ±5% accuracy [63]. After the probe of the instrument (KS-1) is completely inserted in the nanofluid tube, the analyzer is switched on at low power mode, thereby preventing convective currents [64]. A WiseBath (WB-11, witeg Labortechnik GmbH) water bath (Temperature range: Ambient+5℃~ 100℃, Accuracy: ±0.1℃) that include a filled with still water to supply uniform temperatures to the test tube are used to provide stable nanofluids. A sequence of calibrations were carried out using EG for the validation of the accuracy of the sensors.

The conductivity meter and water bath are shown in Fig. 1.To examine thermal conductivity, the preparation of nanocomposites at different concentrations was performed. A thermal conductivity analyzer (Decagon KD2 Pro, ±5%) that works with the technique of transient hot-wire method (THW) based on the ASTM D7896 standard [62] is used to measure the thermal conductivity of produced rGO-Fe 3 O 4 -TiO 2 hybrid nanofluids at 25 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C. The calibration of the sensor needle (KS-1, which is in the range of 0.2-2 W/mK with an accuracy of ±5%.) was carried out first by measuring the thermal conductivity of distilled water and glycerin. The measured values for distilled water and glycerin were 0.611 and 0.292 W/mK, respectively, which agree J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with the literature values of 0.613 and 0.285 W/mK respectively within ±5% accuracy [63]. After the probe of the instrument (KS-1) is completely inserted in the nanofluid tube, the analyzer is switched on at low power mode, thereby preventing convective currents [64]. A WiseBath (WB-11, witeg Labortechnik GmbH) water bath (Temperature range: Ambient+5℃~ 100℃, Accuracy: ±0.1℃) that include a filled with still water to supply uniform temperatures to the test tube are used to provide stable nanofluids. A sequence of calibrations were carried out using EG for the validation of the accuracy of the sensors. The measurements are carried out 40 min., after the system reached thermally steady-state conditions, and the average value obtained after 10 measurements is reported. The conductivity meter and water bath are shown in Fig. 1.</p>

        <p>Therefore, the thickness of the solid-liquid interfacial layer (though the thickness of this interfacial layer is of the order of a nanometer, this nanolayer is considered to be of significant importance, and plays a vital role in heat transport from the nanoparticle to the adjust liquid) and the thermal conductivity improves the overall thermal conductivity of the nanofluid [74]. This is based on the following phenomenon, such as, when there is an increase in nanoparticle concentration, they become more adjacent to one another. The vicinity improves heat conduction and improves thermal conductivity because of electrons and phonons [75,76], this phenomenon is known as the propagation of lattice vibrations, where the phonons, due to random creation, move in random directions, which are further scattered by one another or by the defects. Due to the small interparticle distance in the nanofluids, even using a small concentration of the composite results in ballistic phonons [77]. Also, suspended nanoparticles in the base fluid increase with the temperature increase because of Brownian motion (enabling of direct solid-solid transport from one particle to another and influencing the particle clustering), and thus, the thermal conductivity significantly increases at high temperatures [78]. The improvement in thermal conductivity reaches up to 13.3% at 60 ℃ (shown in Fig. 9) when the particle loading concentration of rGO-Fe 3 O 4 -TiO 2 composite is 0.25 wt% compared to ethylene glycol base fluid as shown in Fig. 8.

Even though the compared studies used high volume fractions compared to our study, our samples showed promsing enhancement. Low-viscosity fluids permit particles to move more freely and rapidly interact with one another, which leads to an increase in the Brownian motion of nanoparticles in fluids; therefore water based nanofluids have higher thermal conductivity compared to EG based nanofluids.

        <p>Limited literature on convective heat transfer of nanofluids is reported in the literature, compared to the effect of particle loading on the increment of thermal conductivity [91]. However, numerous studies reported are on EG/W mixture based nanofluids compared to pure EG [3]. The reason for choosing the EG/H 2 O solution rather than pure ethyl glycol is to keep a lower viscosity and higher conduction as well [17]. Most review papers reported that nanofluids showed higher enhancement of conventional heat transfer performance (coefficient) that improves higher particle loading as well as the raise in Reynolds number and mass flow rate. For turbulent flow regimes, the heat transfer of nanofluids is even more obvious [92].
