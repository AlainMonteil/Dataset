        <p>The future of the world energy lies in clean and renewable energy sources. Many technologies, such as solar cells, wind turbines, etc., have been developed to harness renewable energies in different forms of fuel. Amongst them, electrolysis of water to produce oxygen and hydrogen is one of the paramount developments towards achieving clean energy, which has attained significant attention due to its green and simple method for the production of fuels. In electrolysis of water, the half-reaction containing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a reaction that is kinetically sluggish, which requires higher overpotential to produce O 2 , when compared to the other halfreaction, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Many electrocatalysts are studied extensively to be used in the OER process to get an economical yield out of it. Noble metal-based catalysts are the state-of-the-art catalyst used for OER currently. But due to their high cost and scarcity, they cannot be applied in a large-scale manner to be used in the future. The non-noble metals (transition metals and perovskites) are gaining interest by exhibiting on par or better OER performance compared to the noble metal used. Due to their low cost, ample resources, and several metals available, they have opened up a variety of areas with a different combination of metals to be used as a catalyst for OER. Amongst these metals, cobalt has received massive appreciation for performing as an excellent OER catalyst. Multi metals, multimetal mixed oxides, multimetal phosphides, perovskites, and carbonsupported catalysts containing cobalt have shown low overpotential with high long-term stability. Therefore, in this review, we go through different cobalt-based electrocatalysts for OER, the general mechanism governing the OER process, the challenges that we are facing today to enhance the catalytic performance, and future aspects to overcome such challenges.The future of the world energy lies in clean and renewable energy sources.

        <p>We, as humans, consume energy in different forms in our day to day life. Most of it is in the form of electrical energy that comes from the burning of finite fossil fuels. Combustion of fossil fuels harms our environment due to large scale carbon emission and alternative solutions with clean and sustainable energy are required to overcome our dependency on fossil fuels. Solar energy and wind energy are the most exploited among renewable energies. The amount of solar energy reaching the surface of the earth is several folds greater than that required for human progress so even a low conversion performance would be satisfactory to fulfill the energy requirements. [1] However, wind and solar energy generation are not constant and need efficient and economical storage facilities and conversion to better fuels. Energy conversion to hydrogen releases no carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and it can also generate clean discharge (water) on combustion. [2,3] This has attracted much attention due to its green nature and high energy density. Water splitting is amongst the many promising technologies that enable the production of hydrogen and oxygen, which converts sustainable renewable energy into ideal chemical energy using electricity or sunlight. [4,5] This energy conversion technology has amassed worldwide attention owing to its high energy conversion efficiency, a potentially wide range of applications, and negligible environmental pollution. [6][7][8] Integrated solar water-splitting systems that integrate light-capturing semiconductors with electrocatalysts to effectively split water display specific promise as a means of direct sunlight to fuel production. [9] Thus generated fuels can be used in various applications to reduce carbon emission dramatically. For example, the hydrogen used in a hydrogen driven engine does not burn the fuel like in the conventional internal combustion engine. Instead, it fuses with the oxygen from the air to form H 2 O instead of CO 2 . No primary wastes are produced in the electrochemical splitting of water when the electricity is used from solar cells. As a result, it is considered to be a clean process for producing H 2 and O 2 gases.We, as humans, consume energy in different forms in our day to day life.

        <p>Electrochemical water splitting can be classified into two half-reactions and they are OER and HER. These reactions are kinetically inactive and require an overpotential to occur at a practical rate. The overpotential loss due to OER is generally much greater than HER. Therefore, OER is generally viewed as the bottleneck of water splitting. [9,10] As a consequence, water electrolysis requires effective catalysts to expedite these reactions smoothly and unhindered. Presently, carbon-based platinum is the most efficient catalyst for HER [11][12][13][14] while the standard catalysts for OER are ruthenium-and iridium-based oxides. [15] The first reported work on the OER catalyst was by Meyer and co-workers [16] on the so-called "blue dimer" a binuclear oxobridged ruthenium complex. Even though these are excellent electrocatalysts, scarcity in nature and high cost make it difficult to administer them into large scale applications. This gave rise to the widespread study of different non-precious earth-abundant catalysts that have high efficiency for both OER and HER. Considerable progress has been made in using transition metals for better efficiency in OER. Intellectual studies of Co, Ni, Fe, and Mn-based oxides in OER dates back to more than half a century ago. [17][18][19][20] Among these metals, special mention goes to cobalt-based compounds for OER and HER reactions. Although cobalt has no biological relevance in water splitting, and although it is significantly less abundant than Fe, Mn, or Ni, it is now emerging as a fascinating metal due to its catalytic power for OER and HER. [21] Cobalt compounds, either as molecular species or as three-dimensional materials, seem to be attractive multi-electron catalysts for both HER and OER in the water-splitting process.Electrochemical water splitting can be classified into two half-reactions and they are OER and HER.

        <p>A classic electrolyzer consists of three components, i.e. anode, cathode, and an electrolyte. The electrocatalysts are coated on the electrodes for a speedy activity. In such a system the electrocatalysts used are different on the anode and the cathode which facilitates OER and HER, respectively. But recent studies have come up with new electrocatalysts which are bifunctional for both OER and HER. Ruthenium-and iridium-based compounds had been considered as the novel catalysts for OER due to their high performance in a wide range of pH. [15] Since these precious metals are scarce and expensive, earthabundant transition metal catalysts are studied to replace them. Generally, electrolyzers operate under high conductive media, i.e. either acidic or alkaline. One drawback of these transition metals is that they degrade in an acidic condition due to high oxidative potential which, in turn, hinders the activity of the catalyst. So, to overcome this, most of the transition metal-based OER catalysts are studied under alkaline medium.A classic electrolyzer consists of three components, i.e. anode, cathode, and an electrolyte.

        <p>We can find many proposed mechanisms for OER in literature. [22][23][24][25] Let us denote "M" to be the active site of a catalyst. In the first step, a hydroxyl radical (OH -) is adsorbed onto the active site (M) to give M-OH by an electron (e -) oxidation on OH -. Then another OH - reacts with M-OH to give M-O by removing a proton and electron pair. M-OH and M-O are common intermediates in most of the proposed mechanisms. The dissimilarities start after the formation of M-O. Generally, there are two reaction mechanisms to form oxygen gas (O 2 ) from M-O. In the first (green pathway), it is the direct combination of two M-O intermediates to produce oxygen gas and free active site M. In the second (white pathway), there is a formation of M-OOH intermediate (hydroperoxide intermediate) by the nucleophilic attack of OH -on M-O, paired with an e -oxidation. A further proton paired electron transfer results in the decomposition of M-OOH into O 2(g) and the free active site M. This forms the basis for the majority of the mechanisms proposed with the change in the number of electron transfer in individual steps (single/multiple electron reaction). The bonding interaction within the intermediates (M-O, M-OH, and M-OOH) is decisive for the overall electrocatalytic ability.

        <p>In an electrolyzer, the OER reaction is kinetically sluggish and requires higher overpotential than the HER reaction. Therefore, catalysts with enhanced activity are required to overcome this drawback. Noble metals are among the catalysts that show high activity as well as durability in a vast range of pH for OER reactions. Iridium, ruthenium, gold, and silver are some commonly used noble metals for this purpose. However, because these elements are scarce and expensive, researchers have tried to use them optimally or replacing them in many ways by synthesizing catalysts consisting of cost-effective alternatives while maintaining equal or better performance. Here we discuss mainly the cobalt-based noble metals used for improved OER activity. Since cobalt has high activity for OER, it can be doped with another active catalyst to better the performance.In an electrolyzer, the OER reaction is kinetically sluggish and requires higher overpotential than the HER reaction.

        <p>Iridium has been used as a novel catalyst for OER due to its high stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline medium. Cobalt linked with iridium for OER has been reported by many research groups. Eunju Lee Tae et al. have studied crystalline cobalt oxides nanoparticles (nc-CoO x ) on ITO (indium tin oxide) glass substrate doped with ~5 mol % crystalline iridium oxide nanoparticles (nc-IrO x ). [28] It displayed a much lower overpotential (η) and Tafel slope (b) in comparison to the nc-CoO x electrode and nc-IrO x electrode. Under a buffer solution of 0.1 M phosphate, the η at 1 mA cm -2 values of [nc-CoO x ] ITO were 0.37 V at pH 7 and 0.34 V at pH 13, whereas for [nc-IrO x /nc-CoO x ] ITO were 0.22 V at pH 7 and 0.19 V at pH 13. A drop of 0.15 V can be seen regardless of the pH condition. The Tafel slope for [nc-IrO x /nc-CoO x ] ITO was 29 to 34 mV dec -1 and for [ncIrO x ] RDC (rotating disc carbon electrode) was 38 to 44 mV dec -1 . A work performed by Youkui Zhang et al. saw the development of a self-assembled 3-dimensional Cobalt-Iridium (CoIr-x) hierarchical structures using a one-step reduction path with NaBH 4 as a reducing agent. [29] The Ir species were incorporated into the irregular surfaced cobalt-based hydroxide nanosheets (3D CoIrx) as clusters and single atoms. It showed enhanced activity in the neutral and alkaline medium compared to the commercially available IrO 2 electrocatalyst. [29] In the neutral media (1.0 M phosphatic buffer solution, pH@7), the CoIr-0.2 (0.2 is the molar ratio of Ir to Co in precursor or CoIr with 9.7 wt% Ir content) showed a η of 0.373 V@ 10 mA cm -2 current density, which is relatively lower when compared to the IrO 2 (0.431 V@10 mA cm -2 ). Regarding the Tafel slope, CoIr-0.2 exhibited a value of 117.5 mV dec -1 , which is also below the value for IrO 2 of 132.1 mV dec -1 . Whereas in the basic media (1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH), pH@14), CoIr-0.2 needed an η of 0.235 V to achieve 10 mA cm -2 and Tafel slope of 70.2 mV dec -1 . From the abovementioned electrocatalyst studies, we can understand that the OER activity is favored more by the alkaline medium. This is possible because the rate-determining step of the OER reaction is the accelerated OH -discharge process for the aforementioned catalysts. [30] Recent studies indicate that by enabling electrochemical oxidation of metallic electrocatalysts in basic media one can considerably enhance the behavior of OER in neutral electrolytes as compared to the direct activation in neutral media without pre-oxidation of metallic electrodes. [31] Taehyun Kwon and co-workers fabricated hollow octahedral nanocages of Co-doped on IrCu alloy (Co-IrCu ONC/C) on carbon support [32], which showed excellent OER activity in addition to prolonged stability in acidic medium. The catalyst exhibited an η value of 0.293 V at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , as compared to Ir/C catalyst that showed an η of 0.315 V. A Tafel slope value of 50 mV dec -1 was reported for Co-IrCu ONC/C, and the catalyst also demonstrated high durability with a reduction of only 3 percent after 2000 cycles of CV analysis. In comparison, the Ir/C catalyst dramatically deactivated with a 50% decrease in current density. The outstanding performance of Co-IrCu ONC/C is credited to the 3D integrated structure. In another work, Waqas Qamar Zaman and the team constructed a multimetallic IrO 2 catalyst by co-doping with two different 3d transition metals (nickel and cobalt) to atomically replace 50% of the precious metal. [33] It was developed by the hydrothermal method to make sure composite homogeneity is achieved and later crystallized at 400 °C. The lower crystal formation energy (calculated using DFT (density functional theory) studies) for co-doping was the main factor for the significant dopant penetration. The synthesized co-doped IrO 2 (Ir-NC-50) demonstrated η at 10 mA cm -2 current density of 0.285 V which was significantly lower than individually doped IrO 2 by cobalt and nickel. The Tafel data of Ir-NC-50 was 53 mV dec -1 lower than the classic IrO 2 (65 mV dec -1 ). Therein, they also establish a linear correlation between the decreasing onset potential and the decreasing iridium concentration. This helps in reducing the iridium doping by replacing it with transition metals without any decrease inactivity. Stability studies were carried out by mounting the prepared material (Ir-NC-50) on the Ti plate in an acidic medium at a constant current of 10 mA cm -2 [33][34].Iridium has been used as a novel catalyst for OER due to its high stability and activity in both acidic and alkaline medium.

Regarding the Tafel slope, CoIr-0.2 exhibited a value of 117.5 mV dec -1 , which is also below the value for IrO 2 of 132.1 mV dec -1 . Whereas in the basic media (1.0 M potassium hydroxide (KOH), pH@14), CoIr-0.2 needed an η of 0.235 V to achieve 10 mA cm -2 and Tafel slope of 70.2 mV dec -1 . From the abovementioned electrocatalyst studies, we can understand that the OER activity is favored more by the alkaline medium. This is possible because the rate-determining step of the OER reaction is the accelerated OH -discharge process for the aforementioned catalysts. [30] Recent studies indicate that by enabling electrochemical oxidation of metallic electrocatalysts in basic media one can considerably enhance the behavior of OER in neutral electrolytes as compared to the direct activation in neutral media without pre-oxidation of metallic electrodes. [31] Taehyun Kwon and co-workers fabricated hollow octahedral nanocages of Co-doped on IrCu alloy (Co-IrCu ONC/C) on carbon support [32], which showed excellent OER activity in addition to prolonged stability in acidic medium. The catalyst exhibited an η value of 0.293 V at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , as compared to Ir/C catalyst that showed an η of 0.315 V. A Tafel slope value of 50 mV dec -1 was reported for Co-IrCu ONC/C, and the catalyst also demonstrated high durability with a reduction of only 3 percent after 2000 cycles of CV analysis. In comparison, the Ir/C catalyst dramatically deactivated with a 50% decrease in current density. The outstanding performance of Co-IrCu ONC/C is credited to the 3D integrated structure. In another work, Waqas Qamar Zaman and the team constructed a multimetallic IrO 2 catalyst by co-doping with two different 3d transition metals (nickel and cobalt) to atomically replace 50% of the precious metal. [33] It was developed by the hydrothermal method to make sure composite homogeneity is achieved and later crystallized at 400 °C. The lower crystal formation energy (calculated using DFT (density functional theory) studies) for co-doping was the main factor for the significant dopant penetration. The synthesized co-doped IrO 2 (Ir-NC-50) demonstrated η at 10 mA cm -2 current density of 0.285 V which was significantly lower than individually doped IrO 2 by cobalt and nickel. The Tafel data of Ir-NC-50 was 53 mV dec -1 lower than the classic IrO 2 (65 mV dec -1 ). Therein, they also establish a linear correlation between the decreasing onset potential and the decreasing iridium concentration. This helps in reducing the iridium doping by replacing it with transition metals without any decrease inactivity. Stability studies were carried out by mounting the prepared material (Ir-NC-50) on the Ti plate in an acidic medium at a constant current of 10 mA cm -2 [33][34].</p>
        <p>an overpotential of 0.308 V, much lower than the commercial Ir/C (0.380 V), to reach a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . The catalyst also displayed great activity in a broad pH range. DFT calculations reported that the catalyst's high activity was because of the modulation of highly electron active Ir-5d orbital on the Pt-based hetero-d-band-junction. It also acts as an outstanding trifunctional (ORR, OER, and HER) catalyst in a wide range of pH levels. Alloys containing five or more metal elements in a single phase are categorized as high entropy alloys (HEAs) [37], which provides ample possibilities to alter alloys' catalytic activities and surface electronic properties. [38][39][40][41] Recently, Zeyu Jin and coworkers worked on nanoporous HEA (np-HEA) of AlNiCoIrMo alloy, which showed high activity towards both OER and HER in acidic medium. [42] They were synthesized by incorporating Ir with other four metals into one single nanostructure phase of de-alloyed Al-based precursor alloys with merely 20 atomic % of Ir. The composition effect showed that the as-synthesized np-HEA had a nano ligament size of about 2 nm. An overpotential value of 0.233 V was needed to attain the current density of 10 mA cm -2 and a mass current density of about 115 mA mg -1 in an acidic medium. Seung Woo Lee et al. achieved a highly active and stable 3D mesoporous binary oxide of Ir and Ru (MS-IrO 2 /RuO 2 ) with an optimum Ir to Ru molar ratio of 1:10 via nanoreplication followed by Adams method. [43] When compared with conventional IrO 2 /RuO 2 (0.340 V) , MS-IrO 2 /RuO 2 had a lower overpotential of 0.300 V at 10 mA cm -2 . After the accelerated stability test for over 2 h, the increase in overpotential was found to be 0.022 V for MS-IrO 2 /RuO 2 , whereas 0.044 V for IrO 2 /RuO 2 , demonstrating a better stability for MS-IrO 2 /RuO 2 (Fig. 2).an overpotential of 0.308 V, much lower than the commercial Ir/C (0.380 V), to reach a current density of 10 mA cm -2 .

        <p>A ternary compound with iridium, ruthenium, and cobalt was studied by J.L. Corona-Guinto and co-workers. [44] They developed a RuIrCoO x powder by chemical reduction method, followed by a thermal oxidation process. Cyclic and linear voltammetry at 20 mV s -1 scan rate and 900 rpm in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , was utilized to analyze the electrochemical properties of the electrocatalysts. The RuIrCoO x specimens revealed a Tafel slope value of 70 mV dec -1 at low current densities and 108 mV dec -1 at high current densities. When compared to RuIrOx, Tafel slopes of RuIrCoO x were lower in both the high and the low current densities. Whereas, the overpotential of RuIrCoO x was found to have a value of 0.410 V at a current density of 18 mA cm -2 . Chronopotentiometry experiments were performed in a current pulse of 0.25 mA cm -2 to 75 mA cm -2 in 300 s. The pulse length of the currents was found to be long enough to keep the voltage constant. This result shows that the use of mixed metals can contribute to synergetic effects that may increase the stability and selectivity of OER kinetics. Lei Wang et al. reported an active hollow Ru-modulated Co x P polyhedral structure (Ru-RuP x -Co x P) by adopting a facile solid-liquid-phase chemical method. [45] Catalytic activity measured the value of η@10 mA cm -2 as 0.291 V and a Tafel slope of 85.4 mV dec -1 in an electrolyte of 0.1 M KOH. The obtained value was low compared to RuO 2 (η 10 = 0.312 V) and IrO 2 (η 10 = 0.393 V). They found that Ru modulation can cause unstable surface termination, improve the electron transfer and promote the reaction kinetics by enhancing the density of states at the Fermi level to improve the electron transfer which further reduces the adsorption energy gap between the intermediates. Youngmin Kim et al. synthesized RuO 2 /Co 3 O 4 nanowires by electrospinning process [46], which showed an η of 0.410 V at 10 mA cm -2 when subjected to 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with oxygen. In comparison to Co 3 O 4 and Ketjenblack (KB), RuO 2 /Co 3 O 4 NWs showed a relatively greater OER current density and lower onset and overpotentials. The study established that the addition of highly active and conductive RuO 2 onto the 1-D Co 3 O 4 nanowire enhances the bifunctional performance of catalyst to a larger extent when compared to pure 1-D Co 3 O 4 . Caiyan Gao et al. reported ruthenium-cobalt nanoalloys encapsulated in carbon layers doped with nitrogen fabricated through incipient wetness impregnation pyrolysis process (RuCo@NC-750 °C, 1.56 wt% Ru). [47] It showed great stability and activity towards OER. ICP-AES test of RuCo@NC-750 °C after 10 h of CA test showed unchanged Ru and Co content compared to the initial sample. It exhibited an η value at 10 mA cm -2 of 0.308 V and a TOF value of 0.35 s -1 at η 300 for OER. They related the enhanced activity to the introduction of Ru into the Co lattice matrix, which can significantly increase the transfer of an electron from the alloys to the carbon surface and increase the defects on the carbon surface. In a recent work by Pengsong Li et al., a monoatomic Ru attached on the surface of CoFe-LDH (Ru/CoFe-LDH), with an optimized wt% of 0.45 Ru, displayed an excellent OER activity with a η@10 mA cm -2 as low as 0.198 V, significantly lower Tafel slope of 39 mV dec -1 and high stability in basic solution when compared to CoFe-LDH and commercial RuO 2 catalysts. [48] In-situ and operando XAS measurements along with DFT + U calculation indicated an electronic coupling that is strong between LDH and Ru support, which acts as a cocatalyst to reduce the kinetic energy barrier to form *OOH from *O intermediate and avoided the formation of the high oxidation state of Ru. A comparison of catalytic activity of different transition metal LDH as cocatalysts revealed a trend as η 10 (Ru/CoFe-LDHs) (~0.198 V) &lt; η 10 (Ru/NiFe-LDHs) (~0.220 V) &lt; η 10 (Ru/NiCo-LDHs) (~0.240 V) &lt; η 10 (Ru/MgAl-LDHs) (~0.290 V). Shaoyun Hao and coworkers modified the electronic properties of NiCo-LDH by incorporating Ru cations by one-step chlorine (Cl -1 ) corrosion of Ni foam (NiCoRu-LDH@NF). [49] Due to the high adsorption energy and improved active sites, the catalyst showed η@100 mA cm -2 of 0.270 V, a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec -1 (Fig. 3), and continued stability (55 Hours at 100 mA cm -2 ) in basic solution. As in the previous results, here also, Ru reduced the energy barriers from *OH to *OOH which accelerated the reaction kinetics of OER. Juan Wang and the team fabricated a Co-doped RuO 2 NWs (molar ratio, Ru:Co = 19:1) by combining a facile wet-chemical process and post-annealing treatment. [50] They demonstrated an η@10 mA cm -2 as low as 0.2 V under acidic medium. First-principle calculations estimating the adsorption free energy of intermediates indicate a modulation in d-band center after metal doping, which is thought to be the cause of the enhancement in the OER activity. Jieqiong Shan et al. performed the generation of an alloy of RuIr nanocrystal with Co metal (Co-RuIr). [51] Addition of Co gave way to an enhancement of electronic structure of Co-RuIr alloy resulting in 0.235 V overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope value of 66.9 mV dec -1 in 0.1 M HClO 4 media. This improvement was due to the expected Co leaching which results in increased concentration of O 2-species, which further favors OER catalytic activity.A ternary compound with iridium, ruthenium, and cobalt was studied by J.L.

        <p>Ruohao Dong et al. designed a 2-D layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure comprising of silver (Ag) decorated Co(OH) 2 nanosheets (Ag@Co(OH) 2 ) via a selective reduction-oxidation technique from metal nitrates. [52] In the field of electrocatalysis, cobalt compounds are granted close attention, among the 2-D materials community. Ag@Co(OH) 2 showed excellent performance for OER and a yield of gram-scale, possibly because the near-surface oxygen vacancies in the Co(OH) 2 nanosheets have the capacity to improve the electrophilic ability of O being absorbed, promote the adsorption of -OH on active sites, and shape the -OOH adsorbed species. [53][54] In addition, the Co (OH) 2 interlayer spacing is greater than the typical transition metal hydroxides, resulting in a high ion transfer tendency and improved OER kinetic capability. [55] The electrochemical measurements were performed in an electrochemical workstation that has a three-electrode system in a solution of 1 M KOH (pH ~13.85) at room temperature. CV measurements were performed by sweeping the potential from a value of 1.3 to 1.7 V (vs RHE) at 10 mV s -1 sweep rate and LSV with a 5 mV s -1 scan rate. From the LSV curves η@10 mA cm -2 of Ag@Co (OH) 2 was found to be as low as 0.270 V, whereas a pure Co(OH) 2, synthesized using the same technique showed an η@10 mA cm -2 of 0.350 V. [56][57] They also prepared ternary materials comprising of cobalt, silver, and other transition metal elements (Ag@Co-Ni LDH and Ag@Co-Fe LDH), which showed better performance than the original Co LDH. This explained how silver doping on the LDH can enhance its efficiency by intensifying the catalyst's electrical conductivity. During the chronopotentiometry analysis (about 8 hrs.), the catalytic performance of Ag@Co(OH) 2 faded only faintly with time. Ag@Co(OH) 2 showed the greatest value of current density of 37.6 mA cm -2 @ 0.350 V that was threefold more than that of pure Co(OH) 2 nanosheets. In the case of Tafel slope Ag@Co(OH) 2 exhibited a value of 67 mV dec -1 . Kai-Li Yan et al. synthesized an Ag-doped Co 3 O 4 nanowire array reinforced FTO (Ag-Co/FTO) via a facile electrodeposition-hydrothermal process in acidic media (0.5 H 2 SO 4 ), which presented 1.91 V vs RHE onset potential and 0.680 V overpotential. [58] The results indicate that the vertical growth of Co 3 O 4 nanowire was a result of Ag film deposition on the FTO substrate, and the formation of the mesoporous nanostructure can be attributed to Ag 2 O in Ag-Co hydroxide precursors. In a similar work, B. Jansi Rani et al. reported Ag-doped Co 3 O 4 nanorods via hydrothermal method at different temperatures (90, 120, 150, and 180 °C). [59] The sample synthesized at 150 °C showed a good activity towards OER with 0.344 V overpotential to achieve a current density of 9.45 mA cm -2 . Conducting an EIS study and following the Nyquist plot, they concluded that the product synthesized at 150 °C had a low resistance of 13 Ω and a narrow arc radius indicating quicker interfacial electron transfer. The enhancement in activity could have been due to the incorporation of Ag into Co 3 O 4 crystal lattice which enhances the electrical conductivity and reduces the catalyst's internal resistance. It is also reported that Ag metal enhances the kinetic reversibility, specific capacitance, and redox reaction of pristine Co 3 O 4 . [60] In a different work, Xiaoyun Li et al. fabricated Ag loaded Fe-Co-S embedded on nitrogen-doped carbon composite (CISC-Ag) via calcination method and subsequent simple dipping route (Ag). [61] When they compared the electrocatalytic activity with pristine CISC, they found that CISC-Ag-3% (0.329 V) exhibited a lower overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 than pristine CISC (0.366 V). The measured photocurrent density of Hematite photoanode covered with CISC-Ag-3% (with catalyst loading mass of 0.06 mg cm -2 ) was found to be 0.527 mA cm -2 that was 7 times that the bare hematite photoanode (0.075 mA cm -2 ) at a bias voltage of 1.23 V vs. RHE. They elucidated that this activity was the result of the presence of metallic Ag in the catalyst, which suppresses the surface electron-hole recombination and endorses electron-hole formation. The electrical conductivity of Ag is mainly attributed to the loosely bonded outer electrons of Ag atoms. Therefore, adding Ag to any catalyst increases its electrical conductivity. Xu Zhao and coworkers worked on engineering the electrical conductivity of lamellar Ag-CoSe 2 nanobelts (width 300-500 nm) via partial cation exchange method. [62] About 1% of Ag + cations enhanced the catalyst's OER stability and activity when compared to CoSe 2 nanobelts. 1% Ag-CoSe 2 demonstrated 0.320 V overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 , 22.36 mA cm -2 current density at an η of 0.350 V and low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec -1 . They interpreted that the introduction of Ag + had two effects on the catalyst. Firstly, they found that Ag + caused a 5.6% decrease in the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) which hinders the activity; and secondly, due to the improved electron transport, there was an increase in Co 4+ sites which promotes the OER activity. The small decrement in ECSA was compensated by a more active generation of Co 4+ active sites.Ruohao Dong et al. designed a 2-D layered double hydroxide (LDH) structure comprising of silver (Ag) decorated Co(OH) 2 nanosheets (Ag@Co(OH) 2 ) via a selective reduction-oxidation technique from metal nitrates.

        <p>Aolin Lu and team worked on a core-shell structure of gold (Au)cobalt nanoparticles, with the core being Au nanoparticle and shell being Co 3 O 4 supported by carbon (AuCo/C). [63] They developed the structure by two different methods i.e. a facile one-pot synthesis and an injection synthesis. Due to the synergistic interaction between the shell and the core, core-shell nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit exceptional catalytic activity in comparison to single-component NCs. [64][65] Oxygen and nitrogen saturated solutions were used for OER activity measurements. Electrochemical polarization curves were analyzed at 5 mV s -1 scan rate after the CV test with the working electrode subjected to a rotation of 2000 rpm. They found that the optimal ratio of Au:Co to be 2:3 (Ag 40 Co 60 /C), which showed the highest value of current density of 428.6 and 366.9 mA mg -1 respectively, at 1.67 V, for OER in N 2 and O 2 saturated solutions when prepared by one-pot synthesis. A Tafel slope value of 65 mV dec -1 was exhibited by Au 40 Co 60 /C, which was lower than bulk Au and bulk Co 3 O 4 . Boon Siang Yeo et al. reported cobalt oxide (CoO x ) deposited onto the surface of rough gold (Au) substrate as monolayers for better performance for OER reaction. [66] They reported the OER activity of 0.4 monolayer (ML) of CoO x on Au to be approximately 3 times greater than that of bulk iridium and 40 times greater than that of bulk CoO x under the same electrochemical conditions. The turn over frequency (TOF) of 0.4 ML CoO x on Au was found to be 1.8 s -1 . This was mainly due to the growth in the surface Co IV population confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Xunyu Lu et al. reported Au nanoparticles-doped mesoporous Co 3 O 4 structure (Au/mCo 3 O 4 ) synthesized via a nano casting process using mesoporous silica KIT-6 as a hard template. [67] An enhanced OER activity was obtained with 2.5% Au doped mCo 3 O 4 which displayed a lower onset potential of 1.53 V (vs. RHE) and overpotential of η 10 = 0.440 V when compared to mCo 3 O 4 (onset potential = 1.56 V (vs. RHE), η 10 = 0.520 V). This superior performance was ascribed to the doping of electronegative Au nanoparticles, highly exposed active sites, and large Brunauer--Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. In a different work, Xu Zhao and associates developed CoSe 2 nanobelts decorated with a trace amount (0.1 wt%) of isolated Au atom (Au 1 -CoSe 2 ). [68] They probed from the study that the trace amounts of isolated Au atoms enhanced the exposure of cobalt active sites, limited the use of Au, shifted up the d-band center, and thereby reduced the H 2 O adsorption energy of active sites. An η of 0.303 V at 10 mA cm -2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec -1 was calculated from the LSV curve of Au 1 -CoSe 2 in O 2 saturated alkaline medium (Fig. 4).Aolin Lu and team worked on a core-shell structure of gold (Au)cobalt nanoparticles, with the core being Au nanoparticle and shell being Co 3 O 4 supported by carbon (AuCo/C). [63] They developed the structure by two different methods i.e. a facile one-pot synthesis and an injection synthesis. Due to the synergistic interaction between the shell and the core, core-shell nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit exceptional catalytic activity in comparison to single-component NCs. [64][65] Oxygen and nitrogen saturated solutions were used for OER activity measurements. Electrochemical polarization curves were analyzed at 5 mV s -1 scan rate after the CV test with the working electrode subjected to a rotation of 2000 rpm.

        <p>To elevate a catalyst's activity, synthesis of specific catalyst morphologies and nanostructures has been practiced for a long time. [69] Based on Mott-Schottky's effect, Zhong-Hua Xue and his team created a Janus particle based on cobalt. [30] A Janus Co/CoP nanoparticle was created by a controllable vacuum-diffusion method for continuous phosphidation of carbon-coated metallic cobalt nanoparticle. In Janus particle, one plane was metallic (Co) and the other was semi-conductive (CoP). Co/CoP had a high ECSA than that of pure Co sample which resulted in an enhanced activity for Co/CoP. Co/CoPx showed OER activity in a wide range of pH which makes it different from other conventional electrocatalysts. Overpotential of Co/CoP-5 (η = 0.340 V, where 5 indicates the weight ratio of NaH 2 PO 2 and Co elements) @ 10 mA cm -2 was significantly less than Co (0.430 V) and CoP (0.380 V) species in 1.0 M KOH basic media. In the neutral media (1.0 M PBS), Co/CoP-5 attained a current density of 2.6 mA cm -2 at a potential of 1.8 V (vs. RHE) and in acidic media (0.5 M H 2 SO 4 ) it achieved a current density of 1.3 mA cm -2 at 1.8 V (vs. RHE) potential. The preparation of aligned cobalt-based Co@CoO x nanostructures was performed by Qi and team that was achieved by the pyrolysis of cobalt oxalate precursors. [70] The 2-dimensional alignment of the derived cobalt nanoparticles was guided by the precursor's 2-dimensional morphology. To obtain a current density of 10 mA cm -2 the resulting electrocatalyst needs a significantly low overpotential value of 0.298 V. They performed the OER experiment in an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH on a simple glassy carbon electrode. The nanoparticles' compact alignment as well as the metallic nature of the bulk of the catalyst is capable of assisting with the inner-and inter-particulate transfer of charge. In addition, the particles' 2-dimensional alignment can, in general, intercept the dissolution and ripening of cobalt metal nanoparticles, as compared with isolated nanoparticles that is produced via traditional techniques. [71] The resulting electrocatalyst could also demonstrated a superior stability for electrolysis of 24 h at 1.55 V vs RHE. Jing et al. performed the synthesis of an oriented assembly constructed by hexagonal Co(OH) 2 nanosheets. [72] A solvothermal technique in a mixture of methanol, water, and ethanol were first carried out to achieve single-crystalline CoC 2 O 4 micro rods having ultra-high aspect ratio. The CoC 2 O 4 was then converted into Co(OH) 2 from anionexchange by immersing the CoC 2 O 4 precursor in a solution of alkali. The 1-dimensional microrod single crystals were converted into 2-dimensional nanosheets assembly and 3-dimensional structural voids were generated in the oriented assembly. The resulting materials combined the qualities of both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional arrangements, displaying improved water oxidation activity in comparison to the freely isolated nanosheets. The assembly's magnified performance is primarily due to two reasons. The first is that the anisotropic 2-dimensional nanosheet substructure possesses intrinsic high charge transfer capacity. [73][74] The fabricated ultra-long structure provides a directed pathway for the transfer of charge. The second reason is that the 3-dimensional structural voids elevate the accessible surface area and assist with mass transport. [75] The assembled arrangement can also prevent the aggregation and ripening that takes place during electrolysis for enhanced durability. [71] Relative to the isolated nanosheet counterpart the nanosheet assembly demonstrated a greater activity for OER at similar mass loading. The nanosheet assembly could achieve 10 mA cm -2 current density at an overpotential of 0.359 V, and to achieve the same current density, the isolated nanosheet displayed an overpotential of 0.394 V. In addition, the nanosheet assembly has a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec -1 when determined by LSV at 5 mV s -1 . This value is comparatively smaller than that shown by the isolated nanosheets (95 mV dec -1 ). Wu's group carried out a facile preparation of cobalt metal thin films through physical vapor deposition (PVD) on different nonconductive substrates. [76] These substrates include polyimide, mica sheet, regular and quartz glass, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). When the group performed surface electrochemical modification using cyclic voltammetry, the films became active for electrocatalytic water oxidation. This activity was demonstrated by the film as it achieved 10 mA cm -2 current density at a low overpotential value of 0.330 V in a solution of 1 M KOH. This is also the value required for a photovoltaic equipment to achieve 12.3% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency. [77] The electrodes were also sturdy, and their activity remained unchanged during chronopotentiometry analysis of long durations. Furthermore, no other energy or time consuming treatments (e.g., annealing, aging, or anodic oxidation, are necessary to reach the achieved activity with the resulting catalyst film. Wan and team developed a new electrocatalyst of Co(OH)F for OER. [78] The 3-dimensional Co(OH)F microspheres were constructed by building blocks of 2-dimensional nanoflake, which are then woven by 1-dimensional nanorod foundations. Weaving and constructing the substructures of 1-dimensional nanorods and 2-dimensional nanoflakes could deliver high structural void porosity with abundant interior space in the 3-dimensional material synthesized. The Co(OH)F material's hierarchical structure merges the merits of all material dimensions in heterogeneous catalysis. The advantages being possessed by the anisotropic low-dimensional (1-dimensional and 2dimensional) substructures include swift charge transport and high surface-to-volume ratio. Furthermore, the nanorods' interconnectivity is valuable for charge transport. The 3-dimensional arrangement generates adequate number of active sites per surface area and is useful for efficient mass diffusion during catalysis. With the synthesized material a low overpotential value of 0.313 V was required to drive an OER current density of 10 mA cm -2 in 1 M aqueous solution of KOH. Guo's team employed a facile 2-phase protocol to synthesize an α-Co(OH) 2 by utilizing sodium oleate as a phase-transfer surfactant. [79] The team regulated the structure and crystallinity of the α-Co(OH) 2 by heat treatments toward improved electrocatalytic OER activity. Calcination of the synthesized α-Co(OH) 2 at a temperature of 200 °C produced a networked and well-dispersed nanoparticles of CoO (Co-200). The CoO sample synthesized displayed an OER current density of 10 mA cm -2 under a low overpotential value of 0.312 V in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The improved activity could be described by the presence of ultra-small particle size and ample open spaces, both of which can deliver many surface catalytic sites. In addition, the onset potential for OER was 0.290 V and the Tafel slope was 75 mV dec resulted in the formation of authentic six-branched Co(OH)F nanorods. As a result, nanorods of Co(OH)F were ordered into a six-fold symmetry. Another point to note is that along β-Co(OH) 2 hexagon edges the growth of Co(OH)F nanorods could be observed as lateral branches in place of perpendicular to hexagons. The unusual epitaxial growth mechanism is regarded to be because of the matching between a-axis of β-Co(OH) 2 crystals and the b-axis of Co(OH)F crystals, which is advantageous for electrocatalysis. Relative to pure Co(OH)F and β-Co (OH) 2 , the hybrid material could demonstrate enhanced water oxidation activity such as lower overpotential of 0.329 V to deliver 10 mA cm -2 current density. Liang et al. performed a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-assisted pyrolysis to carry out the transformation of ZIF-67 into meso/microporous cobalt-embedded nitrogen-enriched carbon (Co-NC) material for both OER and ORR. [82] During pyrolysis, PVP was enclosed within ZIF-67 in one-pot and remained in it. With this technique, the breakdown of the porous structure at low temperatures could be avoided. The group chose PVP for a number of reasons. The first one was that PVP could be encapsulated because of the strong coordination interaction between the C]O groups in PVP and the metal ion sites in metal-organic frameworks. [83] The second reason was due to the findings by Lai et al. in which they found that a PVP derived carbon//ZIF derived carbon interfacial structure could be generated in PVP/ZIF nanocomposites. [84][85] The interfacial arrangement may lead to the improved electrocatalytic activities. Therefore, the group proposed that the meso/microporous Co-NC material could modify the pyrolysis functioning of ZIF-67, producing large electrochemical surface area. In addition, the presence of PVP could cause an increase in N content and the generation of the interfacial structure that could further contribute to the enhanced OER and ORR electrocatalytic activities. The group synthesized a number of materials and amongst them P-Co-NC-4 (4 being the synthetic PVP/Co 2+ molar ratio) demonstrated the best activity. Analysis of the sample using LSV showed that it displayed an onset potential of 0.90 V. Its overpotential value at 10 mA cm -2 current density was 0.315 V and it displayed a Tafel slope of 75.7 mV dec -1 . Liang and group prepared quasi-singlecrystalline CoO hexagrams that was characterized by structural longrange ordering and plentiful oxygen vacancies as defects. [86] The material was synthesized at β-Co(OH) 2 /Co(OH)F hexagrams' critical phase transition point. The matching between the a-axis of β-Co(OH) 2 crystals and the b-axis of Co(OH)F crystals is vital for the generation of CoO hexagram single crystals. The resulting material, specifically P-400 (400 = pyrolysis temperature, P = pyrolysis step), possessing abundant defects were very efficient for the oxidation of water as it demonstrated a low overpotential value of 0.269 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm -2 in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Liang and team used a simple preparation technique to produce 2-dimensional ultrathin α-Co(OH) 2 nanosheets. [87] The technique involved mixing cobalt salt aqueous solution with a methanolic solution of 2-methylimidazole at room temperature. The products synthesized were of nanosheets form that were micrometer in size and possessed an average thickness of approximately 2.5 nm. The ultrathin structure provided the α-Co(OH) 2 nanosheet with the ability to perform greatly for OER. An overpotential value 0.267 V was displayed by the resulting material at j = 10 mA cm -2 . With this strategy it is also possible to synthesize other 2-dimensional cobalt-based layered double or triple hydroxides. Furthermore, the α-Co(OH) 2 nanosheets demonstrated a Tafel slope of 64.9 mV dec -1 . This value is comparatively lower than that of commercial RuO 2 (78.7 mV dec -1 ) and hexagonal α-Co(OH) 2 plates (81.2 mV dec -1 ). Quentin Daniel et al. established that when cobalt porphyrins were deposited on FTO glasses (via spin coating), they decompose into thin film of CoO x on the surface during electrochemical water oxidation under borate buffer (pH 9.2, 0.1 M). [88] The thin film was only detectable by XPES using low photon energies (1000 eV). The newly formed catalyst showed advanced activity for OER with a high TOF value of the order of 10 s -1 . Huiling Sun et al. reports the synthesis of four Cobalt corroles attached with different acid/base pendants in neutral aqueous solution. [89] The working electrode used was catalyst loaded on FTO glass. Complex LCH [2]PO(OH) [2] -Co showcased higher performance for both OER and HER compared to other complexes. The LCH [2]PO(OH)2 -Co complex showed an overpotential of 0.45 V. Samaneh Sohrabi and team worked on a composite 3D porous coordination network (PCN) with 3D nanochannels via solvothermal method with the help of Zr 6 clusters and tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin cobalt (MOF). [90] Because of the presence of porphyrins and ultrastable Zr 6 clusters on the backbone of the MOF, it was an easy access for the reactants. The catalyst developed showcased an overpotential of 0.4 V.To elevate a catalyst's activity, synthesis of specific catalyst morphologies and nanostructures has been practiced for a long time. [69] Based on Mott-Schottky's effect, Zhong-Hua Xue and his team created a Janus particle based on cobalt.

        <p>Bangan Lu and co-workers synthesized a nanowire array of nickel and cobalt oxides freely standing on nickel foam substrate (Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1). [91] They reported that Ni doping on the Co 3 O 4 increased the roughness and in turn increased the activity of the catalyst. The Ni doped Co 3 O 4 (Ni:Co = 1:1) and pure Co 3 O 4 had the same nanowire array structure when SEM image analysis was conducted. When the atomic ratio of Ni:Co was larger than 1:1, a change in morphology into nano flake structure was seen. Electrochemical studies showed an overpotential value at 5 mA cm -2 mg -1 of 0.56 V and 0.65 V for Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1 and Co 3 O 4 respectively. At 0.6 V the current density of Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1 was about 5 times in magnitude than that of pure Co 3 O 4 . There was also a 5-fold difference in the roughness factor between Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1 and Co 3 O 4 , which proves that an increase in roughness increases the activity of the catalyst. Ni doping is assumed to increase the electrocatalytic activity of Co 3 O 4 , either by increasing its roughness factor and surface area (geometrical effect) or by enhancing its conductivity (electronic effect) or both. [92] The stability test studied showed a negligible change in potential after 10 h in an alkaline medium. Small Tafel slopes, lower overpotential, and high current density are due to the presence of large active electrochemical surface area (ECSA) as well as 1-D morphology for better charge conduction. Siwen Li et al. had a similar approach to develop a Co-Ni based 1-D nanotube with adjustable Co:Ni ratios by a cation-exchange method to build hydroxides (CoNi(OH) x ) grown on a conductive Cu substrate for OER. [93] The nanotube morphology of the catalyst aided in forming a conductive structure with a large surface area, and therefore producing ample catalytic reaction sites. It is also reported that the Co 2+ at octahedral sites (O h ) gives a better result for OER than Co 2+ at tetrahedral sites (T h ). [94][95] When X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was carried out, a peak at 781.1 eV in the Co L-edge XAS spectra correlates to the characteristic peak of Co 2+ ions at O h . [96] The LSV showed an onset potential value of 1.48 V (vs. RHE) and an η as low as 0.280 V at 10 mA cm -2 with a Tafel slope of 77 mV dec -1 . EIS analysis revealed that CoNi(OH) x nanotube retains a considerably lower charge transfer resistivity which is due to the reaction between the O* intermediate and different hydroxides on the surface of the catalyst. [97] Xuehui Gao et al. synthesized hierarchical NiCo 2 O 4 hollow micro cuboids constructed by 1-D porous nanowire subunits. [98] It exhibited a small onset potential of 1.46 V (vs. RHE) to reach 1 mA cm -2 , 1.52 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm -2, and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec -1 . OER activity of NiCo 2 O 4 is accredited to its unique hollow mesoporous structure composed of 1-D nanowires, which provides easy access for electrolytes to the active sites. Substituting a second metal into monometallic phosphides could efficiently alter the electronic structure of the parent compounds and further enhance the OER activity. Lei Han et al. prepared Ni-Co mixed oxide nanocages from Ni-Co Prussian blue analog (PBA) cubes metal-organic framework (MOF) precursors through an anisotropic chemical etching route. [99] Due to their complex 3-D cagelike hollow structure in addition to the high surface area to volume ratio, they exhibited low overpotential (0.380 V@10 mA cm -2 ) and Tafel slope (50 mV dec -1 ) under basic medium. Wook Ahn and coworkers fabricated a multivoid nanocuboidal MOF catalyst with multiple mesosized and microsized pores synthesized from a ternary Ni-Co-Fe MOF (NCF-MOF) by a facile co-precipitation and post heat treatment method. [100] Altering ion exchange rates of the transition metals in the MOF are used to produce heteroatom doping, interconnected internal voids, and favorably tuned electronic structure by combining the outer electrons of active Co and Fe metal ions, which leads to reduced adsorption strength with the intermediates. All these aids in bringing about enhanced activity of OER with low overpotential (η 10 = 0.320 V) and Tafel slope (49 mV dec -1 ) for the catalyst. [105] It is noted that the presence of rGO increases the number of surface-active sites and enhances the hybrid electrodes' activity. Co doping controls the active sites' catalytic activity and accelerates the charge transfer process of the catalyst. Onset potential of 0.251 V (vs. RHE), η of 0.270 V at 10 mA cm -2, and a small Tafel slope of 65.7 mV dec -1 were reported for the NiCoP/rGO hybrids (x = 1) in an electrolyte of 1.0 M KOH. Long-term catalytic stability proved stable OER current density of 50 mA cm -2 at 0.360 V overpotential for 18 h. Hanfeng Liang and coworkers fabricated ternary a NiCoP nanostructure from hydrothermally formed NiCo hydroxides via PH 3 plasma-assisted approach, supported on nickel foam, for the first time (NiCoP/NF). [106] The plasma-assisted process promoted lowtemperature reaction and fast preparation of the catalyst. From energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, they found the ratio of Ni:Co:P to be 1.106:1:1.138, which was close to NiCoP. Electrocatalytic studies measured an η of 0.28 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , which was lower than Ni 2 P/NF (0.34 V) and NiCo-OH/NF (0.404 V). They attributed the enhanced OER activity to the Co addition which lowered the activation barrier, altered the electronic structure, and synergistic effect between Ni and Co. Junyuan Xu et al. worked on tri-metallic equimolar FeCoNiP on carbon nanofiber (CNF) pre-catalyst prepared by chemical reduction followed by phosphorization treatment. [107] Overpotential as small as 0.2 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density and a high TOF of 0.94 s -1 at an η of 0.35 V was measured from the LSV data under alkaline medium. Also, a greater mass activity of 5000 mA mg -1 was obtained at η = 0.330 V. CNFs aided in the improved charge transfer and increased the nucleation sites during wet chemical reduction. The authors interpreted that Co helps in reducing the overpotential in the low potential region and Ni boosts the anodic current in the high potential region. Jingchao Zhang et al. fabricated mesoporous Ni-Co sulfide nanotubes via template-free solvothermal method followed by anion-exchange process. [108] Due to the synergetic effect between Ni and CO, altered electronic structure, and increased surface area, Ni 0.13 Co 0.87 S 1.097 nanotube exhibited improved performance for OER with lower onset potential (0.262 V at 1 mA cm -2 ), overpotential (0.316 V at 10 mA cm -2 ) and Tafel slope (54.72 mV dec -1 ) in comparison to CoS 1.097 (η 1 = 0.280 V, η 10 = 0.331 V and Tafel slope = 55.54 mV dec -1 ). A 3-D structure promotes OER activity by contributing to the high specific surface area, more defects as exposed active sites, accelerated H 2 O adsorption, and easy gas permeability. Chengzhou Zhu et al. designed a 3D bimetallic Ni-Co oxide hollow nanosponges (HNS) by a sodium borohydride reduction strategy (Ni-Co 2 -O HNS). [109] Due to the hollow structure, synergetic effect between Ni-Co and high specific surface area, the catalyst exhibited a superior OER activity. Ni-Co 2 -O HNS had a porous and interconnected network and an ultra-low density of around 0.08 g cm -3 . LSV curve showed an onset potential of as low as 1.501 V (vs. RHE) and an η of 0.362 V in 0.1 M O 2 saturated KOH solution. In a different work, Seok-Hu Bae and co-workers shaped a 3D conductive carbon-shelled Ni-Co nanowire structure (CCS Ni-Co NWs) (Fig. 5). [110] The Ni-Co nanowires grown on the carbon fiber woven fabric (hydrothermal method) were coated with conductive carbon shell via glucose carbonization followed by annealing processes. The granular and porous structure of Ni-Co nanowires aids in the rapid release of O 2 and provides an enlargement in the number active of sites. Whereas the carbon shell aids in fast electron transmission from the active site to the current collector (carbon fiber fabric) and avoids the dispersion of catalytic particles during active O 2 evolution. These properties of the structure helps in enhancing the catalyst's OER activity. A 0.302 V overpotential @10 mA cm -2 with a Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec -1 in KOH solution of 1 M concentration was reported. When compared with Ni-Co NWs, the charge transfer resistance of CCS Ni-Co NWs was lower, implying increased current access and enhanced charge transport efficiency. [111] Another notable merit of this catalyst is that it acts as a catalytic electrode, which can be deposited directly on the working electrode without any binders. Cheng Du et al. reported a continuous hydrothermal, oxidation, and phosphidation process using NaH 2 PO 2 to synthesize a 3-D nest-like ternary NiCoP supported on carbon cloth (CC) electrocatalyst. [112] In alkaline medium, η of 0.242 V @ 10 mA cm -2 with a Tafel slope of 64.2 mV dec -1 was reported. They concluded that the addition of urea, carbon cloth, and the coexistence of Ni and Co precursors to be the main reason for the 3-D nest-like structure. Furthermore, the carbon cloth acts as a current collector to improve the conductivity and charge transferability. [105]Bangan Lu and co-workers synthesized a nanowire array of nickel and cobalt oxides freely standing on nickel foam substrate (Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1). [91] They reported that Ni doping on the Co 3 O 4 increased the roughness and in turn increased the activity of the catalyst. The Ni doped Co 3 O 4 (Ni:Co = 1:1) and pure Co 3 O 4 had the same nanowire array structure when SEM image analysis was conducted. When the atomic ratio of Ni:Co was larger than 1:1, a change in morphology into nano flake structure was seen. Electrochemical studies showed an overpotential value at 5 mA cm -2 mg -1 of 0.56 V and 0.65 V for Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1 and Co 3 O 4 respectively. At 0.6 V the current density of Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1 was about 5 times in magnitude than that of pure Co 3 O 4 . There was also a 5-fold difference in the roughness factor between Ni x Co 3-x O 4 -1:1 and Co 3 O 4 , which proves that an increase in roughness increases the activity of the catalyst. Ni doping is assumed to increase the electrocatalytic activity of Co 3 O 4 , either by increasing its roughness factor and surface area (geometrical effect) or by enhancing its conductivity (electronic effect) or both. [92] The stability test studied showed a negligible change in potential after 10 h in an alkaline medium. Small Tafel slopes, lower overpotential, and high current density are due to the presence of large active electrochemical surface area (ECSA) as well as 1-D morphology for better charge conduction. Siwen Li et al. had a similar approach to develop a Co-Ni based 1-D nanotube with adjustable Co:Ni ratios by a cation-exchange method to build hydroxides (CoNi(OH) x ) grown on a conductive Cu substrate for OER. [93] The nanotube morphology of the catalyst aided in forming a conductive structure with a large surface area, and therefore producing ample catalytic reaction sites. It is also reported that the Co 2+ at octahedral sites (O h ) gives a better result for OER than Co 2+ at tetrahedral sites (T h ). [94][95] When X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was carried out, a peak at 781.1 eV in the Co L-edge XAS spectra correlates to the characteristic peak of Co 2+ ions at O h .

        <p>Linzhou Zhuang and coworkers reported Fe-Co oxide nanosheet (Fe x Co y -ONS, x/y indicates the molar ratio of Fe/Co) synthesized by a solution reduction process using NaBH 4 reducing agent to improve oxygen vacancies and the catalyst's active sites. [113] The optimized Fe 1 Co 1 -ONS had a high specific surface area of about 261 m 2 g -1 which resulted in an η of only 0.308 V@10 mA cm -2 and Tafel slope as low as 36.8 mV dec -1 in an alkaline solution (0.1 M KOH). The results obtained were superior to those of commercial RuO 2 . At η = 0.350 V, Fe 1 Co 1 -ONS showed a current density of 54.9 A g -1 , which is 5.8 times larger than that of RuO 2 available commercially. A detailed characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Photoluminescence spectroscopy confirmed that the excellent OER performance of the catalyst was due to abundant oxygen vacancies which result in an easy excitation of the delocalized electrons into the conduction band near the oxygen-deficient sites.

        <p>designed a FeOOH sandwiched cobalt hybrid nanotube arrays supported on nickel foam (FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs-NF). [114] Co and FeOOH were loaded as 0.28 mg cm -2 and 0.22 mg cm -2 , respectively. EIS studies confirmed that FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs-NF has a significantly smaller electronic resistance when compared to FeOOH NTAs-NF. This result confirms that the Co metal layer enhances electron transmission because of its high electrical conductivity and Ni foam acts as a current collector which together overcomes the poor electric conductivity of FeOOH. The optimum thickness of 25 nm for FeOOH showed the highest OER activity.designed a FeOOH sandwiched cobalt hybrid nanotube arrays supported on nickel foam (FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs-NF).

        <p>FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs-NF showed an overpotential of just 0.250 V (Fig. 5) to reach 20 mA cm -2 current density and a Tafel slope as low as 32 mV dec -1 in an alkaline medium. Chronopotentiometric studies performed for 50 h showed no negligible change in overpotential to maintain the current density values of 20, 50, 100, and 200 mA cm -2 . Theoretical studies suggest that the energy of OER intermediates can be modulated with the inclusion of metal elements for a given metal oxide. Bo Zhang et al. fabricated a gelled FeCoW (oxy) hydroxides (G-FeCoW) using a sol-gel procedure that would include incorporation of W 6+ into FeCo (oxy) hydroxides, which is hydrolyzed at a controlled rate to achieve atomic homogeneity. [115]) Here, tungsten (W) modulated 3d metal oxide (CoOOH), provided excellent adsorption energies for OER intermediates which in turn enhanced catalytic activity. When the G-FeCoW catalyst underwent electrocatalytic studies, it exhibited surprising results compared to the FeCo LDH and NiFe LDH. It presented an η of 0.191 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density when deposited on a gold-plated Ni foam. This is significantly lower than the precious metal-based electrocatalyst used for OER previously. The stability test showed no appreciable increase in potential under 30 mA cm -2 current density for 550 h. When the catalytic measurements were conducted on glassy carbon (GC) electrode, the catalyst showed an η of 0.223 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density, a TOF of 0.46 s -1 and mass activity of 1175 A g -1 . Similar work has been reported by Peng Fei Liu et al. where they used molybdenum (Mo 6+ ) to modulate 3d metal (oxy) hydroxides (FeCoMo) to attain better adsorption energy for the OER intermediates and provide rich active sites for OER. [116] FeCoMo displayed an η of 0.277 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density on GC and no evidence of degradation was reported for about 40 h at constant 10 mA cm -2 current density. It exhibited a bulk mass activity of 177.35 A g -1 at 0. [110,114]. add to the phosphorization, and synergetic effect between Co and Fe, the unique structure provides a great surface area and ample interlinked channels for O 2 release and mass transport. In a similar work, Xiao Zhang and team introduced a novel CoFeP multi-void nanocages (CoFeP-NC) that were derived from CoFe-PBA (Prussian blue analog) nanocubes via a self-template phosphorization process with uniform size ranging from 250 nm to 350 nm. [120] From the XPS spectra, it was clear that both Co and Fe acted as active sites in the catalyst, and the synergism induced between them improved the electronic structure as well. In alkaline medium, CoFeP-NC showed an η as low as 0.180 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density, superior stability, and a turnover frequency of 0.93 s -1 at 0.270 V overpotential. This enhanced OER activity could be explained by the porous hollow system with large surface area, high effective active sites, and reduced charge transfer distance. The pyridinic N doped in the CoFeP catalyst provided an added synergistic effect to OER activity. The catalyst exhibited a fastcurrent density increase within a small change in overpotential (η 100 = 0.280 V). Yuan et al. developed a hierarchical hollow nanocube structure that was based on ultrathin CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanosheets. [121] The group first prepared Cu 2 O nanocubes as the self-sacrificing template. They employed a template-assisted route for the production of hollow nanocubes based on CoFe-LDH nanosheets through coordinating etching. The performance of the resulting material was demonstrated when it displayed a low overpotential of 0.270 V for 10 mA cm -2 current density for water oxidation. A low Tafel slope value of 58.3 mV dec -1 as well as a long-term stability was also displayed in an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH. DFT study was also performed by the research group and the analysis revealed that Fe addition provided a metallic identity with Co(OH) 2 , assisting in electron transfer. Qian Zhou et al. reported a facile cationexchange process for creating iron-doped Co(OH) 2 nanosheets with the augmented active site. [122] Iron-doped Co(OH) 2 nanosheets showed lower Tafel slope and overpotential (53 mV dec -1 , η 10 = 0.320 V) when compared to pristine Co(OH) 2 nanosheets (69 mV dec -1 , η 10 = 0.370 V). After the cation exchange process, Fe 3+ /Co 2+ , the Fedoped Co(OH) 2 nanosheets had substantial grain boundaries, rougher surface, improved hydrophilicity, and enhanced electronic properties which resulted in an enhanced activity for OER. In recent work, Lei Zhong and coworkers produced Fe doped CoTe (Fe-CoTe) by a one-step solvothermal process, which showed excellent activity and stability without any activation process. [123] A 0.300 V overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 current density and 45 mV dec -1 Tafel slope value were observed from the electrocatalytic measurements. The authors elucidated that Fe-CoTe had the maximum Fe-Co synergy and the catalytic performance was due to intrinsic properties of Fe-CoTe, and not from the Fe impurity adsorbed from the electrolyte. The improved amount of lattice oxygen also aided to the enhanced OER activity. The charge transfer resistance of Fe-CoTe was only 1/6th of the pristine CoTe catalyst, representing the Fe-doping effect. Sheng-Hua Ye et al. fabricated Fe substituted CoOOH porous nanosheets arrays developed on a cloth of carbon fiber (Fe x Co 1-x OOH PNSAs/CFC, x 0 0.33) with 3-D structures via in-situ anodic oxidation of α-Co(OH) 2 NSAs/CFC. [124] Fe 0.33 Co .0.67 OOH PNSAs/CFC showed enhanced activity towards OER with a low η 10 of 0.266 V and a Tafel slope value of 30 mV dec -1 . X-ray absorption fine spectra (XAFS) studies indicated a partial substitution of CoO 6 octahedral structures in CoOOH by FeO 6 octahedral during the conversion from α-Co(OH) 2 to Fe x Co 1-x OOH. Detailed DFT calculations indicated that such substitution can reduce the energy levels of the intermediates and products as FeO 6 octahedron is a highly active site for OER. Li-Ming Cao and team proposed a concrete pathway for the hierarchical fabrication of a novel self-supporting 3-D porous sulphurdoped NiCoFe LDH nanosheets (S-NiCoFe LDH) on carbon cloth. [125] The EIS measurements revealed that the charge transfer resistance (R CT ) value of S-NiCoFe LDH was smaller than those of undoped LDH (NiCoFe LDH and NiFe LDH), which indicates that sulphur doping helped in improving the catalyst's electrical conductivity. A low η of 0.206 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density as well as a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec -1 was reported from the electrocatalytic measurements. The XPS results supported that the Co-S bonds and Ni-S bonds were altered into Ni/Co oxyhydroxides that further enhanced the OER activity.FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs-NF showed an overpotential of just 0.250 V (Fig. 5) to reach 20 mA cm -2 current density and a Tafel slope as low as 32 mV dec -1 in an alkaline medium.

[120] From the XPS spectra, it was clear that both Co and Fe acted as active sites in the catalyst, and the synergism induced between them improved the electronic structure as well. In alkaline medium, CoFeP-NC showed an η as low as 0.180 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density, superior stability, and a turnover frequency of 0.93 s -1 at 0.270 V overpotential. This enhanced OER activity could be explained by the porous hollow system with large surface area, high effective active sites, and reduced charge transfer distance. The pyridinic N doped in the CoFeP catalyst provided an added synergistic effect to OER activity. The catalyst exhibited a fastcurrent density increase within a small change in overpotential (η 100 = 0.280 V). Yuan et al. developed a hierarchical hollow nanocube structure that was based on ultrathin CoFe-layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) nanosheets. [121] The group first prepared Cu 2 O nanocubes as the self-sacrificing template. They employed a template-assisted route for the production of hollow nanocubes based on CoFe-LDH nanosheets through coordinating etching. The performance of the resulting material was demonstrated when it displayed a low overpotential of 0.270 V for 10 mA cm -2 current density for water oxidation. A low Tafel slope value of 58.3 mV dec -1 as well as a long-term stability was also displayed in an aqueous solution of 1 M KOH. DFT study was also performed by the research group and the analysis revealed that Fe addition provided a metallic identity with Co(OH) 2 , assisting in electron transfer. Qian Zhou et al. reported a facile cationexchange process for creating iron-doped Co(OH) 2 nanosheets with the augmented active site. [122] Iron-doped Co(OH) 2 nanosheets showed lower Tafel slope and overpotential (53 mV dec -1 , η 10 = 0.320 V) when compared to pristine Co(OH) 2 nanosheets (69 mV dec -1 , η 10 = 0.370 V). After the cation exchange process, Fe 3+ /Co 2+ , the Fedoped Co(OH) 2 nanosheets had substantial grain boundaries, rougher surface, improved hydrophilicity, and enhanced electronic properties which resulted in an enhanced activity for OER. In recent work, Lei Zhong and coworkers produced Fe doped CoTe (Fe-CoTe) by a one-step solvothermal process, which showed excellent activity and stability without any activation process. [123] A 0.300 V overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 current density and 45 mV dec -1 Tafel slope value were observed from the electrocatalytic measurements. The authors elucidated that Fe-CoTe had the maximum Fe-Co synergy and the catalytic performance was due to intrinsic properties of Fe-CoTe, and not from the Fe impurity adsorbed from the electrolyte. The improved amount of lattice oxygen also aided to the enhanced OER activity. The charge transfer resistance of Fe-CoTe was only 1/6th of the pristine CoTe catalyst, representing the Fe-doping effect. Sheng-Hua Ye et al. fabricated Fe substituted CoOOH porous nanosheets arrays developed on a cloth of carbon fiber (Fe x Co 1-x OOH PNSAs/CFC, x 0 0.33) with 3-D structures via in-situ anodic oxidation of α-Co(OH) 2 NSAs/CFC. [124] Fe 0.33 Co .0.67 OOH PNSAs/CFC showed enhanced activity towards OER with a low η 10 of 0.266 V and a Tafel slope value of 30 mV dec -1 . X-ray absorption fine spectra (XAFS) studies indicated a partial substitution of CoO 6 octahedral structures in CoOOH by FeO 6 octahedral during the conversion from α-Co(OH) 2 to Fe x Co 1-x OOH. Detailed DFT calculations indicated that such substitution can reduce the energy levels of the intermediates and products as FeO 6 octahedron is a highly active site for OER. Li-Ming Cao and team proposed a concrete pathway for the hierarchical fabrication of a novel self-supporting 3-D porous sulphurdoped NiCoFe LDH nanosheets (S-NiCoFe LDH) on carbon cloth. [125] The EIS measurements revealed that the charge transfer resistance (R CT ) value of S-NiCoFe LDH was smaller than those of undoped LDH (NiCoFe LDH and NiFe LDH), which indicates that sulphur doping helped in improving the catalyst's electrical conductivity. A low η of 0.206 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density as well as a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec -1 was reported from the electrocatalytic measurements. The XPS results supported that the Co-S bonds and Ni-S bonds were altered into Ni/Co oxyhydroxides that further enhanced the OER activity.</p>
        <p>Jingrui Han et al. developed an amorphous Mn-Co-P layer on MnCo 2 O 4 supported on a titanium mesh (Mn-Co-P@MnCo 2 O 4 /Ti) through a cathodic polarization in NaPO 2 H 2 solution. [126] Under alkaline medium, the catalyst demonstrated an η of 0.269 V at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , Tafel slope of 102 mV dec -1 which was lower compared to MnCo 2 O 4 /Ti (η 10 = 0.362 V, 210 mV dec -1 ). XPS results revealed that the Mn-Co-P layer was produced on the surface of the MnCo 2 O 4 as a shell that boosts the OER activity. Xijun Liu et al. reported hierarchial Zn x Co 3-x O 4 nanoarrays which had secondary nanoneedles grown on primary rhombus-shaped pillar arrays supported on titanium (Ti) foil prepared by the co-deposition of zinc and cobalt precursors followed by calcination in air. [127] A 0.320 V overpotential @ 10 mA cm -2 was detected for Zn x Co 3-x O 4 -1:3 (1:3 is the ratio of Zn and Co precursor used) nanoarrays with a low Tafel slope value of 51 mV dec -1 . Zn x Co 3-x O 4 can be directly used as electrodes for OER. [128] The close contact of the 3-D porous structure to Ti foil ensured long term stability and gave way for the conduction of electrons. [127,129] The enhanced performance of Zn x Co 3-x O 4 is attributed to the unique hierarchical 3-D nanostructure which brings about high porosity, large surface area, more active sites, increased roughness factor, and improved gas permeability. Jianfeng Ping and team prepared a 3-D porous CoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (CoAl-NS) onto a 3D graphene network (3DGN) by electrostatic self-assembly (3DGN/CoAl-NS). [130] Here to obtain the CoAl-NSs, the CoAl-LDH (NO 3-) crystal with the largest interlayer area was made use for exfoliation. The electrochemical activity was studied in 1 M KOH with a loading mass of CoAl-NSs on 3DGN as about 0.05±0.01 mg cm -2 . The results revealed an η at 10 mA cm -2 current density to be 0.252 V and a 36 mV dec -1 Tafel slope value. At η = 0.300 and 0.350 V, the current densities values were 45.37 and 91.74 mA cm -2 , respectively. Stability tests confirmed a nearly constant current density for 18 h at η = 0.250 and 0.280 V. The exposed active edge sites of the CoAl-NSs made it easy for the proton paired electron transfer process during OER. [131][132] Also a constant coating of single layer CoAl-NSs on the 3DGN by electrostatic self-assembly is an effective way by which it can expedite the reaction kinetics and accelerate the electron transfer. [133][134] Furthermore, the unique structure of 3DGN aids for the access of ions to the catalysts and prevents the restacking of CoAl-NSs [135][136][137].Jingrui Han et al. developed an amorphous Mn-Co-P layer on MnCo 2 O 4 supported on a titanium mesh (Mn-Co-P@MnCo 2 O 4 /Ti) through a cathodic polarization in NaPO 2 H 2 solution.

        <p>Denis Kuznetsov et al. introduced a high electronegative (Bi 3+ ) element into the A-site of the strontium cobalt perovskites to sustain high Co-O covalency through the inductive effect. [140] An exceptionally low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec -1 was obtained for the bismuth substituted strontium cobalt perovskites. This was attributed to the potentially increased hydroxide kinship on the catalyst's surface by the introduction of Bi 3+ ions. Xi Cheng et al. analyzed the influence of Sr substitution into the A-site of LaCoO 3 perovskites. [141] The surface composition, bulk electronic structure, electrochemical activity, and conductivity for the La 1-x Sr x CoO 3 perovskite series ( x 0 1.0) were investigated experimentally and theoretically. A phase transition from rhombohedral (LaCoO 3 ) to cubic structure (La 1-x Sr x CoO 3 ) was observed after the gradual replacement of La by Sr. They found that Sr substitution has the effect of aligning along the Co-O-Co axis, straightening the octahedral cage, and rising the average oxidation state of Co ions. DFT calculations proved that the above merits improve the overlap between the unoccupied Co 3d conduction bands and the occupied O 2p valence bands which further improved the catalyst's OER activity.Denis Kuznetsov et al. introduced a high electronegative (Bi 3+ ) element into the A-site of the strontium cobalt perovskites to sustain high Co-O covalency through the inductive effect.

        <p>To understand the influence of B-site substitution in perovskites, Maria A. Abreu-Sepulveda et al. investigated an organized substitution of Co by Fe in La 0.6 Ca 0.4 CoO 3 perovskites (La 0.6 Ca 0.4 Co 1-x Fe x O 3 ) under alkaline medium via a facile glycine-nitrate synthesis. [142] A rise in the surface concentration of different Co oxidation states by the incorporation of Fe was showcased by the XPS results. Specific activity trend of the substitution followed the trend: Fe0.9 &gt; Fe0.8 &gt; Fe0 &gt; Fe0.1 &gt; Fe0.2 &gt; Fe0.5 &gt; Fe1.0. Iron incorporation decreased the barrier for electron transfer and facilitated the generation of cobalthydroxides. A Tafel slope value of 49 mV dec -1 was determined for La 0.6 Ca 0.4 Co 0.1 Fe 0.9 O 3 (x = 0.9). They found that Fe complexes are significant for OER by enabling the interaction of Co-OH bond and CoOOH are responsible for the electronic conductivity. Under alkaline medium layered double hydroxide perovskites PrBaCo 2 O 6-δ (PBC) has been found to be very active. The addition of Fe further enhances the activity. Xiaomin Xu et al. reported BaCo 0.9-x Fe x Sn 0.1 O 3-δ (BCFSn) perovskites oxides through doping Fe and Sn in BaCoO 3-σ parent oxide via solid-state reaction under alkaline medium. [143] BCSFsn-721 (x = 0.2) displayed a low value of onset potential ( 1.53 V vs. RHE), overpotential ( 0.420 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density) and a Tafel slope value of 69 mV dec -1 . They established that the catalyst's OER activity can be tuned by simply altering the concentration of Fe and Sn. The mass activity of the catalyst can be further enriched by reducing their particle size or creating pore structures with a large surface area.To understand the influence of B-site substitution in perovskites, Maria A.

When stability tests were conducted, PBCF55 lost only 32% of its starting current density, while PBC lost approximately 74% of its initial current density.

Advanced OER ability with low onset potential (1.49 V vs. RHE), overpotential (η 10 = 0.420 V), and Tafel slope of 76 mV dec -1 was observed due to excellent ionic and charge-transfer capabilities along with optimized e g orbital filling, and high O 2 desorption and OH - adsorption abilities.

[156] Here we discuss various cobalt-based catalysts supported on carbon materials towards oxygen evolution reaction.</p>

        <p>Lu and Zaho prepared crystalline cobalt oxide nanoparticle of ~6 nm size incorporated with mildly oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Co 3 O 4 /mMWCNT) and used it as an effective catalyst for H 2 O oxidation. They studied the correlation between various other carbon structures such as single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), graphene, and multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) with different oxidation states in terms of charge transport and surface functionalization towards water oxidation reaction. The results showed that the hybrid mildly oxidized MWCNTs (Co 3 O 4 /mMWCNT) with a 0.390 V overpotential value (at 10 mA cm -2 ) and 1.51 V vs. RHE onset potential that can sustain the electrochemical reaction even under harsh environment with minimum carbon corrosion acting as a promising electrocatalyst towards OER [157]. Zeng et al. reported the bifunctional cobalt (II/III) oxides strongly anchored onto a lightweight, conductive, and crosslinked aerogel film of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a free-standing air electrode. The LSV profile showed improved performance of crosslinked aerogel film of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) when compared with pristine CNT aerogel, N-CNT aerogel, and pure Co 3 O 4 in terms of onset potential (1.45 V) and potential (1.7 V vs RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 ) (overpotential of 0.47 V) [158]. Shuo and coworkers followed the pyrolysis of metal-organic framework (MOF) encapsulated Co 3 O 4 for the successful generation of Co-embedded N-doped CNTs with porous carbon (PC) that showed prolonged stability and excellent activity in alkaline solution. The polarization curve for Co-CNT/PC exhibited lower onset potential than Co-doped over porous carbon (Co-PC) that could be attributed to the improvement in the electrical conductivity for CNT. [159] Zhang and coworkers reported a superior activity and remarkable stability for cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (CCHH) nanosheets strongly adhered on the mildly oxidized MWCNTs in presence of diethylenetriamine (DETA). They found that the presence of DETA greatly influences the structure and morphology of the CCHH/MWCNT composite and thereby enhanced the resulting OER performance. Thus, prepared hybrid CCHH/MWCNT exhibited lower onset potential (approximately 1.47 V vs RHE) (overpotential of 0.285 V @ 10 mA cm -2 ) and good kinetics that was clear from the Tafel slope analysis. [160] In 2014, the same group reported a study on Co 3 O 4 nanorod-multi-walled carbon nanotube hybrid (Co 3 O 4 @ MWCNT) that exhibited 0.309 V overpotential at 10 mA cm -2 current density in an alkaline medium that also possess superior activity and stability. [161] Fang et al. analyzed the synergistic influence of Co(II), organic ligands, and CNTs that offered excellent activity and durability to sustain in a harsh environment without any carbon corrosion. The hierarchical 3-D unique system with a large surface area improved the transportation of electrons and secured the anchoring of the catalyst's active sites to the CNTs. Co-MOF@CNTs offered impressive durability and activity when compared to 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO 2 catalysts. They studied the influence of the OER performance on the amount of CNT in the overall catalyst and found that the overpotential followed an inverted volcano type trend with CNT weight percentage with increasing order of 5% &lt; 1% &lt; 10% &lt; 15% of CNTs. [162] In order to improve the surface defect, chemically active sites, and the surface defects of CNTs; hetero atom doping with boron, phosphorous and nitrogen are widely used. Dicobalt phosphides (Co 2 P) are another category of Cobased catalyst that recently achieved wide attention owing to their catalytic and magnetic properties. Various reports are available on Co 2 P anchored CNTs delivering excellent electrochemical performance. Hui et al. utilized N, P co-doped CNTs for the anchoring of CoP/CoP 2 nanoparticles that exhibited low overpotential, higher current density and excellent stability over 100 h. Moreover, they conducted density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations that concluded the synergetic effects of CoP and CoP 2 improved the electrocatalytic performance; also the heteroatom-doped CNTs readily diffuse out the generated O 2 molecule to help in improving the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. [163] Das and co-workers followed a novel one pot synthesis of phosphine free (PH 3 ) Co 2 P anchored over N, P dual doped carbon nanotubes without any external carbon additive. The average diameter of prepared Co 2 P was found to be 55 nm and for NPCNTs the range was between 80 and 250 nm. The hybrid Co 2 P/NPCNT displayed a small onset potential value of 1.293 V and an η of 0.370 V (at 10 mA cm -2 ) that was expected for a solar watersplitting device with 10% efficiency. [164] Guo and team utilized a combination of dicobalt phosphide (Co 2 P)-cobalt nitride (CoN) core-shell nanoparticles synthesized using direct pyrolysis method as double active sites for the incorporation with N doped CNTs that showed excellent trifunctional performance. The interface between CoN and N-doped CNTs was the active site for OER that has attracted applications in flexible and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. [165] Cobalt sulfides, including CoS 2 , CoS 4 , Co 3 S 4, and Co 9 S 8 , have been found to be attractive and are novel electrocatalysts for the storage of energy as well as conversion applications because of the unique chemical and physical properties. [166][167] The performance of cobalt sulfides were improved by further optimization of electrode surface with carbonbased materials. Wang and co-workers prepared an integrated 3-D model of carbon-paper/carbon-tubes/cobalt-sulfide array that displayed impressively high performance towards OER. The unique hybrid structure possibly enhanced the accessibility and availability of active sites, the capacity to transport electron, and improved the release of product gases. They studied the catalyst without any CNT incorporation and found that CP/CTs/Co-S have excellent behavior in terms of potential and current density when compared to CP/Co-SN. [168] Xinwei and his team used atomic layer deposition (ALD) for the successful deposition of the thin layer of Co 9 S 8 (~7 nm) onto the CNT network scaffold with a high surface area that showed remarkably great performance for rechargeable Zn-air batteries [169].Lu and Zaho prepared crystalline cobalt oxide nanoparticle of ~6 nm size incorporated with mildly oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Co 3 O 4 /mMWCNT) and used it as an effective catalyst for H 2 O oxidation.

        <p>The electrical conductivity of oxidized-CNTs is lower than nonoxidized CNTs that limit their catalytic performance, nonetheless, this limitation, in some cases can be overcome by using a mildly oxidized graphene/CNTs. [170] Ting Ma et al. performed an in-situ synthesis of ultra-small Co-Mn-O spinel nanoparticles that have an average nanoparticle size of 4.4 nm reinforced over the non-oxidized CNTs that enabled strong coupling to aid with the transfer of electron and enhanced the activity. CMO@CNTs exhibited a lower onset potential of 2.558 V and a Tafel slope of 81.1 mV dec -1 that showed superior performance when compared with CMO@rGO, and CMO@Vulcan, CMO@oxCNTs, and CMO + CNTs. [171] Fig. 7 shows the synthesis of non-spinel MnCo oxide, Co x Mn 1-x O (Mn 2+ , Co 2+ ) anchored over N-doped CNTs that showed much higher OER activity than commercial IrO 2 . Co 2+ was regarded as the active site for the evolution of oxygen because NCNT/ MnO exhibited inferior performance than NCNT/CoO as reported by Liu's group. [172] Kunpeng and his team followed a two-step gas phase process for the fabrication of hierarchical hybrid Co 3 O 4 -MnO 2 -CNT. The prepared spinel Mn-Co mixed oxide triggered the growth of multiwalled carbon nanotube and the active metal particles remained on the CNT surface were greatly influenced by the growth time. An HNO 3 vapor treatment was used to convert the active metals to their higher oxidation state, where MnO was oxidized to MnO 2, and Co was converted to Co 3 O 4 . Subsequently, a small amount of oxygen functional group was created on the surface of the catalyst that facilitated the release of gases during the reaction. [ This indicates that the powerful coupling effect that is present between La 2 O 3 nanorod and MnO 2 nanotubes, Co 3 O 4 and CNTs produces a synergy for the catalytic performance. [174] Another catalyst, Ni, showed enhanced performance in OER when alloyed with Co to form bimetallic Ni-Co. Many works have been reported on the encapsulation of NiCo with conducting CNTs in order to improve the electronic conductivity. Jie et al. fabricated a 3D network of NiCo encapsulated with nitrogendoped CNTs (NiCo@NCNTs) as shown in Fig. 7e -h that showed superior activity than the bimetallic composite (Co@NCNTs and Ni@ NCNTs) owing to the synergy between cobalt and nickel. They conducted a detailed study on the effect of coupling on NiCo@NCNTs in comparison with physically mixed NiCo and CNTs. The superiority of encapsulated NiCo@NCNTs caused the transfer of electrons from NiCo alloy to the walls of carbon nanotubes that reduced the local work function on the carbon surface. Also, the wrapping of CNTs over the active NiCo alloy effectively resisted the etching in harsh environment and made the catalyst active and stable for long duration. [175] Yang and co-workers fabricated ultra-small Ni x Co 3-x O 4 nanocrystals (~5 nm) decorated over pristine MWCNTs using the solvothermal method without destroying the CNTs. Pristine MWNTs showed an efficient electron transfer network and its incorporation with well-constructed spinel Ni x Co 3-x O 4 led to an outstanding electrochemical performance [176]. Numerous cobalt-carbon based catalysts were reported showing extremely high activity and performance due to the hierarchical structure and synergetic effect including Co-N/CNT [177], Co-NRCNTs [178], Co(OH) x -NCNT [179], Ni foam-supported N-CNT@Co 3 O4 [180], CNTs-Au@Co 3 O 4 [181], CoHCF/CNT [182], Co-CNT/Ti 3 C2 [183], CoFe/Co 8 FeS 8 /CNT.

        <p>A composite of graphene and Co 3 O 4 (G-Co 3 O 4 composite) has been reported by Zhao's research team, that possesses a unique sandwicharchitecture as shown in Fig. 8a. [193] Analysis of the composite using TEM and FESEM has shown that there is a homogeneous distribution of Co 3 O 4 on the 2 sides of graphene nanosheet (Fig. 8, b-e). A superior catalytic behavior towards OER in an alkaline solution of 1 M KOH has been observed (Fig. 8, f-i). An onset potential of 1.454 V vs. RHE was exhibited by the composite. Furthermore, within the same alkaline solution, the achievement of 10 mA cm -2 current density was observed at an η of 0.313 V that is more superior than that of the mesoporous Co 3 O 4 catalyst (0.525 V) and Co 3 O 4 /SWNTs (0.593 V). In terms of stability, the composite is expected to exhibit long-term stability as it demonstrated no clear decay in current density during testing in alkaline solution after 10 h as well as an undisturbed morphology. The extraordinary behavior could be due to the synergistic influence arising from the combination of both Co 3 O 4 and graphene that include swift electron transfer rate, large electroactive surface area, and better chemical and electrical coupling of the composite. In another study performed by Zhao et al., a catalyst of CoO nanoparticles wrapped by porous graphene sheets was synthesized using 1-D silica nanorods as a template to prepare the porous graphene. [194] The catalyst possessed great specific surface area and porosity and showed rapid charge transport kinetics. An improvement in catalytic activity was also seen for OER that includes large current density and a low onset potential. When the performance of the catalyst was studied in a KOH solution of 0.1 M concentration via LSVs, the PGE-CoO hybrid demonstrated a small onset potential of 1.4934 V vs. RHE that is considerably lower than GE-CoO (1.5494 V vs. RHE) and CoO (1.5594 V vs. RHE) itself. Moreover, at 10 mA cm -2 current density, the composite exhibited a low overpotential of 0.348 V. To measure the efficiency of the PGE-CoO catalyst Tafel plots were obtained from the LSVs and a Tafel slope value of 79 mV dec -1 was determined. In comparison to the value obtained for GE-CoO and CoO this value is way smaller (GE-CoO showed 192 mV dec -1 and CoO showed 354 mV dec -1 ).

        <p>Wang's group produced a series of electrocatalyst in which graphene and cobalt oxide NPs nano-hybrids (Co-N/G) are doped nitrogen via a one-pot hydrothermal method. [195] A nitrogen precursor is known as 2, 4, 6-Triaminopyrimidine was also utilized to anchor cobalt oxides NPs onto the graphene oxide surface. The composites synthesized consisted of cobalt oxides in the form of Co 3 O 4 and CoO as well as a high content of doped nitrogen (~6 at. %) comprising of pyrrolic, pyridinic, and graphitic types. The resulting synergistic effect generated from the coupling between Co NPs and nitrogen-doped graphene allowed the composite samples to be used as catalysts for both OER and ORR. The as-synthesized Co-N/G 600 (sample carbonized under N 2 atmosphere at 600 °C) showed the highest potential for application in reversible electrochemical energy conversion fuel cells and metal-air batteries. This is because Co-N/G 600 demonstrated an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with high efficiency in which high activities for oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction were observed at a potential of 0.76 V (1.554 V onset potential vs RHE) and -0.2 V (0.855 V onset potential vs RHE), respectively. In addition, the Co-N/G 600 catalyst showed both fine stability and durability for both the type of reactions. Graphene-based materials doped with nitrogen have been used by Hou et al., where nitrogen-doped graphene was combined with a Co-embedded porous carbon polyhedron to form N/ Co-doped PCP//NRGO. [196] A simple pyrolysis of graphene oxide (GO) and zeolitic imidazolate-framework (ZIF), ZIF-67, was implemented in the preparation of the new novel hybrid electrocatalyst after which metallic cobalt was partially etched away. The utilization of ZIF-67 was performed to take advantage of the plentiful Co-N moieties and the unique dodecahedral morphologies available with ZIF-67. [193,207]. [197] With these properties, ZIF-67 may be a fitting precursor for the generation of N/Co-doped PCP. The as-synthesized hybrid catalyst showed excellent performance, including great stability, not only for OER but also for ORR and HER. Such enhancement could be associated with the dual-active-site mechanisms that emerge from the synergetic influences between NRGO sheets and PCP doped with N/Co. The hybrid electrocatalyst also demonstrated a four-electron pathway, great durability, and high tolerance towards methanol. Furthermore, during the performance analysis of N/Co-doped PCP//NRGO for oxygen evolution reaction, only a small η value of 1.66 V was noticed at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . Qiao's group co-doped graphene with both Co and nitrogen and inserted carbon nanospheres into the graphene sheets interlayers. [198] The carbon nanospheres behaved as "spacers" that enlarged the accessible surface area of graphene and provided many electrolyte channels. These two unique properties helped in promoting the diffusion of reaction species to the active sites. Enhanced conductivity could also be guaranteed as the carbon nanospheres could further act as "shortcuts" for interplanar electron transport. The synthesized catalyst possessed bifunctional stability and catalytic activity for both ORR and OER in a basic medium. When compared to Pt/C catalysts the overall oxygen electrode activity parameter (ΔE) of the bifunctional Co-N-GCI electrocatalyst was relatively lower (0.807 V). The overpotential for Co-N-GCI catalyst at 10 mA cm -2 current density was determined to be 0.426 V, that was much lower than those obtained for Co-N-G hybrid (not intercalated with conductive carbon nanospheres, 0.472 V), and commercial Pt/C (0.621 V), at the same current density. Moreover, an excellent intrinsic OER kinetic of Co-N-GCI was confirmed by a relatively lower Tafel slope value of about 69 mV dec -1 in comparison to Co-N-G (~78 mV dec -1 ), IrO 2 /C (~83 mV dec -1 ) and Pt/C (~168 mV dec -1 ). A strongly coupled hybrid electrocatalyst of CoO x NPs grown on B, N-decorated graphene (CoO x NPs/BNG) was produced by Tong et al. that is suitable for catalyzing both ORR and OER. [199] An abundant presence of oxygen vacancies and strong CoeNeC bridging bonds were identified in the hybrid using advanced spectroscopic techniques. These qualities promote the enhancement inability to transfer electron, a greater number of active sites, and a strong synergetic coupled effect. Towards OER in a solution of KOH with 0.1 M concentration, the hybrid electrocatalyst functioned with high efficiency by demonstrating a low η of 0.295 V (at 10 mA cm -2 current density) and a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec -1 . These values are significantly lower than that for NG (0.500 V overpotential, 110 mV dec -1 Tafel slope) and Co-BG (0.320 V overpotential, 70 mV dec -1 Tafel slope) catalysts. Synthesis of N-and B-doped graphene hollow spheres coated with Co 3 O 4 (Co 3 O 4 /NBGHSs) was reported by Jiang's team for use as a potential catalyst for both ORR and OER. [200] The resulting catalyst had the ability to perform with comparatively higher activities and durability for the two reactions than RuO 2 /C and Pt/C. The coupling between NBGHSs and Co 3 O 4 , high electrical conductivity, the strong interaction with O 2 being adsorbed, and the specific hollow design were the contributing factors in the improved performance of the catalyst. Using LSV studies in an alkaline 0.1 M solution of KOH, a value of onset potential of about 1.6 V was recorded, which is more negative than those found for pure Co 3 O 4 hollow microspheres, Co 3 O 4 /BGHSs, Co 3 O 4 /NGHSs, Co 3 O 4 /GHSs, NBGHSs, and Pt/C. However, in comparison to the conventional RuO 2 /C catalyst, the OER onset potential of Co 3 O 4 /NBGHSs is greater. The η for attaining a current density of 10 mA cm -2 was determined to be approximately 0.47 V for Co 3 O 4 /NBGHSs, which is less than that of RuO 2 /C with a potential of about 0.52 V. Lu et al. produced N-doped Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals combined with core-shell structured carbon nanotube-graphene nanoribbon (N-csCNT-GNR) scaffolds. [201] A high loading of Co 3 O 4 was achieved during the synthesis by utilizing a microwave-assisted controlled unzipping of MWCNTs. The high surface area of carbon nanomaterials, as well as excellent electrical conductivity, could both be achieved as the csCNT-GNR structures possess an interlinked unzipped graphene nanoribbon and an intact MWCNT core. [202][203][204] The composite catalysts were also proven to be incredibly active towards both OER and ORR. OER investigation results obtained from the study in 0.1 M KOH have shown that Co 3 O 4 /N-csCNT-GNR could perform very actively by exhibiting an onset potential value of 1.51 V. An η of 0.360 V (iR corrected polarization curve) was also observed to obtain 10 mA cm -2 current density. The remarkable activities demonstrated by the synthesized composite was found to be more superior in comparison to Ir/C catalyst for OER [205][206].Wang's group produced a series of electrocatalyst in which graphene and cobalt oxide NPs nano-hybrids (Co-N/G) are doped nitrogen via a one-pot hydrothermal method. [195] A nitrogen precursor is known as 2, 4, 6-Triaminopyrimidine was also utilized to anchor cobalt oxides NPs onto the graphene oxide surface. The composites synthesized consisted of cobalt oxides in the form of Co 3 O 4 and CoO as well as a high content of doped nitrogen (~6 at. %) comprising of pyrrolic, pyridinic, and graphitic types. The resulting synergistic effect generated from the coupling between Co NPs and nitrogen-doped graphene allowed the composite samples to be used as catalysts for both OER and ORR. The as-synthesized Co-N/G 600 (sample carbonized under N 2 atmosphere at 600 °C) showed the highest potential for application in reversible electrochemical energy conversion fuel cells and metal-air batteries. This is because Co-N/G 600 demonstrated an excellent bifunctional catalytic activity with high efficiency in which high activities for oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction were observed at a potential of 0.76 V (1.554 V onset potential vs RHE) and -0.2 V (0.855 V onset potential vs RHE), respectively. In addition, the Co-N/G 600 catalyst showed both fine stability and durability for both the type of reactions. Graphene-based materials doped with nitrogen have been used by Hou et al., where nitrogen-doped graphene was combined with a Co-embedded porous carbon polyhedron to form N/ Co-doped PCP//NRGO. [196] A simple pyrolysis of graphene oxide (GO) and zeolitic imidazolate-framework (ZIF), ZIF-67, was implemented in the preparation of the new novel hybrid electrocatalyst after which metallic cobalt was partially etched away. The utilization of ZIF-67 was performed to take advantage of the plentiful Co-N moieties and the unique dodecahedral morphologies available with ZIF-67. [193,207]. [197] With these properties, ZIF-67 may be a fitting precursor for the generation of N/Co-doped PCP. The as-synthesized hybrid catalyst showed excellent performance, including great stability, not only for OER but also for ORR and HER. Such enhancement could be associated with the dual-active-site mechanisms that emerge from the synergetic influences between NRGO sheets and PCP doped with N/Co. The hybrid electrocatalyst also demonstrated a four-electron pathway, great durability, and high tolerance towards methanol. Furthermore, during the performance analysis of N/Co-doped PCP//NRGO for oxygen evolution reaction, only a small η value of 1.66 V was noticed at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 . Qiao's group co-doped graphene with both Co and nitrogen and inserted carbon nanospheres into the graphene sheets interlayers. [198] The carbon nanospheres behaved as "spacers" that enlarged the accessible surface area of graphene and provided many electrolyte channels. These two unique properties helped in promoting the diffusion of reaction species to the active sites. Enhanced conductivity could also be guaranteed as the carbon nanospheres could further act as "shortcuts" for interplanar electron transport. The synthesized catalyst possessed bifunctional stability and catalytic activity for both ORR and OER in a basic medium. When compared to Pt/C catalysts the overall oxygen electrode activity parameter (ΔE) of the bifunctional Co-N-GCI electrocatalyst was relatively lower (0.807 V).

        <p>Ganesan's research team prepared a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in which cobalt sulfide NPs are grown on a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene oxide surface through a solidstate thermolysis technique. [207] During the synthesis process, the size, and phase of the particle could be controlled by altering the treatment temperature. Three different treatment temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C were employed in addition to the use of cobalt thiourea and graphene oxide to successfully disperse cobalt sulfide NPs onto graphene oxide. Analysis performed using X-ray diffraction has shown that the hybrids produced at 400 °C and 500 °C consisted of pure CoS 2 phase while that synthesized at 600 °C contained Co 9 S 8 phase. A simultaneous co-doping of both nitrogen and sulfur on graphene oxide was confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that acts as sites to strongly anchor CoS 2 NPs onto the GO surface. Amongst the catalysts synthesized CoS 2 (4 0 0)/N, S-GO displayed an excellent electrode performance. It exhibited a potential of approximately 0.82 V vs. RHE in basic medium (Fig. 8n), that was far superior compared to Ir/C (0.92 V), Ru/C (1.01 V), and Pt/C (1.16 V).Ganesan's research team prepared a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst for ORR and OER in which cobalt sulfide NPs are grown on a nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene oxide surface through a solidstate thermolysis technique.

        <p>Many of the recent research studies that focused on the replacement of platinum-based catalysts with hybrids consisting of non-precious metal have employed mesoporous carbon in addition to graphene and nanotubes. These carbon materials are generally doped with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) before they are introduced into transition metals such as cobalt, iron, manganese, and their complexes. [211][212][213] Doping with heteroatoms can help modify the surface electronic structure as well as develop surface hydrophilicity to adsorb O 2 species particularly in ORR. [214] Non-precious metal-supported carbon materials doped with nitrogen commonly have excellent performance for both OER and ORR when they contain cobalt oxides. This can be because of their ability of cobalt to change their valence states and maintain a steady activity [215].Many of the recent research studies that focused on the replacement of platinum-based catalysts with hybrids consisting of non-precious metal have employed mesoporous carbon in addition to graphene and nanotubes.

        <p>Liu et al. prepared an efficient OER electrocatalyst in the form of 3-D mesoporous carbon-framework-encapsulated CoTe 2 nanocrystals from a metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor. [216] They also implemented tellurization and carbonization processes that aided in yielding nanocomposites of CoTe 2 and graphitic carbon doped with nitrogen (CoTe 2 @N-GC) immediately from ZIF-67. The resultant catalyst demonstrated a much greater performance towards OER by exhibiting an η value of 0.300 V (at 10 mA cm -2 current density) and value of Tafel slope of 90 mV dec -1 in comparison to porous N-doped graphitic carbon powder and pristine CoTe 2 . The presence of N-doped graphitic carbon matrix support provides an interaction with the confined CoTe 2 nanocrystals to enhance OER in addition to offering fully accessible active sites and better electrical conductivity. A mesoporous carbon material doped with nitrogen has previously been utilized by Hu's group along with cobalt oxide NPs enclosed in graphitic layers as a promising non-noble metal oxygen electrode catalyst. [217] A series of catalysts were produced through a facile one-pot synthesis technique that involved polymerization, centrifugation washing, and pyrolysis. Several bifunctional catalysts were developed that possess incredible performance through the adjustment of the carbonization temperatures. Analysis performed on the optimal and as-produced Co-N/C 800 (800 °C carbonization temperature) catalyst showed that the catalyst presented a small reversible η value of 0.96 V between OER and ORR. This value recorded is even greater than those offered by 20 wt% Pt/C (0.270 V), RuO 2 (0.390 V), and IrO 2 (0.460 V) catalysts, and indicates that the catalyst can act as a top performance non-noble metal bifunctional catalyst for reactions involving reversible oxygen electrode. A facile soft-template mediated technique was employed by Shen's research team that assisted in fabricating nanostructured Co-Fe double sulphides that are covalently enclosed within N-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon (Co 0.5 Fe 0.5 S@N-MC). [218] Characterization methods such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction were conducted during the study to unravel the connection between the structural characteristics and the composite's catalytic behavior. Based on the analysis, there was a moderate substitution as well as a fine distribution of Fe in bimetallic sulfide composites that were suspected to generate a beneficial influence on both the activation and adsorption of species containing oxygen. As a result, a unique catalyst with enhanced performance towards OER and ORR was produced that is far better than the monometallic counterparts. In addition, a covalent bridge exists between the mesoporous carbon shells and the active sulfide particles that create easy pathways for the transport of mass and electron. The features possessed by the Co 0.5 Fe 0.5 S@N-MC catalyst resulted in an early onset potential value of around 1.57 V and 10 mA cm -2 current density at a low η of 0.41 V. A relatively lower Tafel slope value of 159 mV dec -1 than IrO 2 (267 mV dec -1 ) was also observed. Wang's group also described the use of mesoporous carbon to produce electrocatalysts that have the bifunctional ability in the form of Co/Co 3 O 4 /Co(OH) 2 /N-doped mesoporous carbon (Co-NC) through a one-pot synthesis process. [219] The remarkably superior Co-NC catalyst synthesized was Co-NC 750 (750 °C carbonization temperature) that had the highest quantities of pyridinic nitrogen as well as an optimized ratio of three cobalt species. The advantage that was achieved from the presence of the strong enclosure influence between N-graphitic shell of Co-NC and Co/Co 3 O 4 /Co(OH) 2 core included a reduced reversible overvoltage value of 1.02 V between both OER and ORR in an alkaline medium.

        <p>Wang and co-workers made use of carbon cloth as support for cobalt phosphide nanoarrays that could efficiently catalyze OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic media. [220] An overall potential of 1.61-1.63 V (η overall = 0.380-0.400 V) was necessary for water splitting in a 2-electrode configuration at a current density of 10 mA cm -2 over 72 h. It was found that a layer of CoO x , the active species, covered the CoP catalyst surface during electrolysis, but the improved activity was mostly due to the presence of CoP core and the nanoarray morphology. 10 mA cm -2 current density was obtained at an η value of 0.281 V when the synthesized catalyst was utilized for OER. The development of a bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and HER using Ni promoted Co disulfide nanowire array and carbon cloth support (Ni 2.3% -CoS 2 /CC) was performed in the past by Fang et al. [221] A simple hydrothermal method was used for the preparation of Ni 2.3% -CoS 2 /CC that allows carbon cloth to be uniformly coated with Ni 2.3% - CoS 2 nanowires of 50 to 100 nm in diameter and length of several micrometers. The OER activity of Ni With regards to OER, a small η of 0.509 V was recorded for CCH-2/C to obtain 10 mA cm -2 current density. This value is less positive than that of Pt/C and it is 0.065 V less active than that found for Ir/C catalyst. These findings provided an evidence that CCH-2/C could be a promising catalyst when utilized as a cathode material for OER. Fan's research team produced a composite catalyst of Co-OBA/ C (OBA = 4,4′-Oxybis (benzoic acid)) involving carbon black. [224] The synthesis process included an integration of a metal-organic framework of Co-OBA with black carbon through a hydrothermal process. The composite was evaluated for ORR and OER using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in an alkaline medium, and results indicate a potential of 0.553 V for Co-OBA/C at 10 mA cm -2 , relatively smaller than the value obtained from Co-OBA (0.758 V) and Co-OBA + C (0.691 V).Wang and co-workers made use of carbon cloth as support for cobalt phosphide nanoarrays that could efficiently catalyze OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic media.

        <p>Water splitting is one of the most effective and green way to easily convert sustainable energies (solar, wind, and blue energies) into useful high purity fuels (H 2 and O 2 ). Among the two half-reactions of water splitting (HER and OER), water oxidation reaction (OER) is a kinetically sluggish reaction which hinders the easy conversion of water into H 2 and O 2 , and considered a bottleneck for large scale applications. So, it is vital to develop a potent catalyst that can demonstrate both prolonged stability and low overpotential, which can further improve the OER activity and display a better overall faradaic efficiency. However, there are some challenges that we must first overcome to create such an effective electrocatalyst:Water splitting is one of the most effective and green way to easily convert sustainable energies (solar, wind, and blue energies) into useful high purity fuels (H 2 and O 2 ).

        <p>The atomic rearrangement and reaction mechanism is still not well understood due to rapid changes and multiple possibilities between the steps of the OER process. Without understanding the mechanism, we cannot predict the rate-determining step (RDS) of a reaction, and without knowing the RDS we cannot pinpoint the phenomenon regulating the activity for the catalyst, which makes it difficult to further improve it. In the case of multi-metal compound catalysts, the exact recognition of catalytically active sites is important to improve the OER activity. Because of the rapid transformation in OER process, chemical changes and restructuring of the catalyst is difficult to detect and requires advanced tools e.g. combination of in-situ spectrometric methods, electrochemical techniques, microscopy techniques and theoretical calculations for finding out the critical factors affecting a reaction and precisely determining the catalyst active sites.The atomic rearrangement and reaction mechanism is still not well understood due to rapid changes and multiple possibilities between the steps of the OER process.

        <p>Most of the precious metal-based catalysts for OER (such as Ir-and Ru-based) work efficiently under acidic medium, whereas transition metal-based catalysts work best under alkaline medium. We have only very few catalysts that show excellent behavior within a broad pH range. The search for a versatile catalyst working in a wide range of industrial electrolysis conditions (strongly acidic to strongly basic conditions) is underway. Perhaps, even a better option is to have a catalyst that operates best in the neutral media to avoid corrosion issues and increase the durability of the catalyst compared to alkaline and acidic condition systems.Most of the precious metal-based catalysts for OER (such as Ir-and Ru-based) work efficiently under acidic medium, whereas transition metal-based catalysts work best under alkaline medium.

        <p>The use of carbon-based support (e.g. carbon black) has a possibility of carbon corrosion and electrochemical oxidation that produces CO or CO 2 at high potentials for long-time use. This effect hinders the performance of the catalyst which is due to a reduction in the reactive surface area as well as the dissolution of the support into the electrolyte. Dilution of the doped material into the electrolyte can also disturb the accurate measurement of the activity.The use of carbon-based support (e.g. carbon black) has a possibility of carbon corrosion and electrochemical oxidation that produces CO or CO 2 at high potentials for long-time use.

        <p>In the case of soluble active catalysts, binders are needed to immobilize the catalyst onto the solid surfaces (e.g. GC). The polymer binders hinder effective charge transfer between the catalyst and electrolyte and disrupt the gas permeation from/to the catalyst. So a need exists to convert such catalysts into electrode materials by efficient and economical methods for grafting them onto a solid surface without the use of any binders.In the case of soluble active catalysts, binders are needed to immobilize the catalyst onto the solid surfaces (e.g. GC).

        <p>The experimental results obtained and the DFT results vary often because the practical catalysts do not comprise of a perfect single surface as the theoretical model frequently use. DFT helps in finding the active sites of a catalyst. As the catalysts get complicated (multimetal doping or addition of support), it is more difficult to identify the exact active site of the catalyst using computational tools.The experimental results obtained and the DFT results vary often because the practical catalysts do not comprise of a perfect single surface as the theoretical model frequently use.

        <p>A good electrocatalyst should possess good electrical conductivity, large number of active sites, and resistance to corrosion under high anodic potential. The concept of using different metals to meet individual functional requirements in extended lattices may be useful in constructing catalysts that can follow and satisfy multiple criteria simultaneously. Integrating these high-performance catalysts on to solar cells for fuel production is admired by many as they offer clean and sustainable solutions for energy requirements. Formulation of a bifunctional or trifunctional catalyst that can work in all media is still a dream to be achieved. Creative modeling and production of exclusive nanostructures to enhance the performance for OER is possible with advanced facilities. A catalyst design approach is required following systemic steps based on descriptors rather than the trial-and-error method to create good catalysts. Effective studies should focus on a comprehensive evaluation of reaction mechanism, online monitoring of chemical changes, analysis of structural transformation by applying operando, and in-situ techniques to decipher the catalyst structure that transitions into active sites during the reaction conditions. This knowledge with advanced synthesis tools could help in designing versatile catalysts that can perform outstandingly under varying industrial conditions.A good electrocatalyst should possess good electrical conductivity, large number of active sites, and resistance to corrosion under high anodic potential.

        <p>World energy consumption has been increasing at a drastic rate. The energy produced from the burning of the limited fossil fuels is not sustainable and affects the environment adversely. So, the need for an energy transition towards a more sustainable and renewable form is of paramount importance for our future generations. Electrolysis of water using renewable energies has received much attention due to its clean method to produce chemical fuels that have the capability to substitute the existing carbon-emitting fossil fuels. In this review, we discussed various cobalt-based electrocatalysts for the OER. It has the capacity for large scale applications by replacing the precious-metal-based catalysts that are scarce and costly. We have discussed cobalt in presence of noble metal (Ir, Ru, Au, and Ag) as catalysts with high activity towards OER in acidic medium with a low amount of noble metals present in the electrocatalyst. Largely the review focuses on catalysts where cobalt is present with other transition metal (such Fe, Ni, Co, and Mn) in a bimetallic or tri-metallic form, which show outstanding OER activity in alkaline media. Furthermore, we have discussed some of the cobaltbased perovskite oxides with partial doping of A-site and B-site with other elements and anion substitution, which aided in the high activity of the perovskite catalyst. As support, we have included the effect of carbon-based compounds that enhance the OER activity in presence of cobalt catalysts. The review also includes a discussion on the mechanism of OER along with comparing the performance of OER catalysts with the help of measurement standards like the overpotential and Tafel slope.World energy consumption has been increasing at a drastic rate.
