        <p>We examine the time-frequency co-movements and return and volatility spillovers between the rare earths and six major renewable energy stocks. We employ the wavelet analysis and the spillover index methodology from January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020. We report that the COVID-19-triggered significant increase in co-movements and spillovers in returns and volatility between the rare earths and renewable energy returns and volatility. The rare earths act as net recipient of both return and volatility spillovers, while the clean energy stocks are net transmitters of return and volatility spillovers before and during the COVID-19 crisis. The solar and wind stocks are net transmitters/receivers of spillovers before/during the pandemic. The remaining markets shift from net spillover receivers to transmitters or vice versa; evidencing the effects of the pandemic. Our results show that cross-market hedge strategies may have their efficiency impaired during the periods of crises implying a necessity of portfolio rebalancing.We examine the time-frequency co-movements and return and volatility spillovers between the rare earths and six major renewable energy stocks.

        <p>Rare earths metals (REMs) are a critical resource for contemporary societies. They are indispensable ingredient in modern industry with the uses in new energy, energy conservation, new materials, aerospace, environmental protection, and electronic information industries (McLellan et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2015;Zhou et al., 2022). REMs are key components of sustainability technologies such as wind turbines and electric vehicles. However, major developed economies have been experiencing severe disruptions of REMs supply, being the situation severely affected since 2019 by the US-China trade tensions relative, in particular, to the REMs outbound shipments from China. In addition, the REMs supply-demand binominal has been being adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 global outbreak. Therefore, spillover patterns between the REMs and renewable energy markets as well as mechanisms at play underlying the cross-market innovations' transmission represent an important contemporary question, with a rather scarce coverage in the scientific literature. In this context, our paper investigates static connectedness and dynamic spillovers in return and volatility time-series and time-frequency co-movements between the REMs and six important renewable energy stock markets from during 2018-2020. This period covers the escalation of the trade tensions between the US and China around 2019 and the apogee of the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020. As we consider the six most important sub-sectors in the domain of renewable energy production, our results are particularly capable of providing refined valuable insights to market participants and regulators in the realm of renewable energy and REMs.Rare earths metals (REMs) are a critical resource for contemporary societies.

        <p>Our motivation is also straightforward as such a detailed analysis, discriminating between different sectors within the renewable energy economy is important for investors and financial professionals in search for better diversification opportunities and advanced hedge strategies, workable through the periods of global crises such as COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, our motivational drivers have their origins rooted in significant investments in renewable energy, projected for the near future, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, they reside in an ongoing upsurge of the rare earths in a quality of investment vehicles. More concretely, our motivation, from the applied finance point of view is three-fold. First, due to a certain opacity of the rare earths' materials and renewable energy industries, a certain lack of trust (Reboredo and Ugolini, 2020) and concerns regarding price volatility have resulted in failures of multiple projects because of insufficient investment. Second, exposures to rare earths' materials have been becoming important portfolio diversification practices, igniting attention from investment communities and requiring a better information coverage of rare earths' prices and their interrelations with other industries and markets. Third, each time wider attention to an unstoppable expansion of renewable energy facilities have resulted in a vast body of research dedicated to the connectedness and risk spillovers between renewable and conventional carbon-based energy markets. However, the literature on the rare earths and renewable energy is rather scarce and insufficient. Hence, in light of all the above discussed aspects, we are motivated, by means of our research, to provide useful insights for academy scholars, investors and market practitioners.Our motivation is also straightforward as such a detailed analysis, discriminating between different sectors within the renewable energy economy is important for investors and financial professionals in search for better diversification opportunities and advanced hedge strategies, workable through the periods of global crises such as COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, the aspired transition to renewable energies requires an urgent evolution of the REMs markets (Elshkaki, 2021;Hodgkinson and Smith, 2021). Beyond their primary importance for the renewable energy companies, REMs are intensively required by several non-energy industries (Müller et al., 2016;Nassar et al., 2016). Therefore, to guaranty a sustainable shift to renewable energy production, a reliable supply of REMs is of an extreme importance (Elshkaki, 2021;Watari et al., 2021). The REMs mining and production is dominated by China and, hence, REMs supply possesses serious inherent vulnerabilities (Buchholz and Brandenburg, 2018;Mancheri et al., 2019;Watari et al., 2021). The intrinsic riskiness of the REMs supply chains is responsible for large variations in their prices, which have been observed since the global financial crisis and will continue into the foreseeable future due to unstable supply, increasing demand, diverse market disruptions because of local and global crises, and unceasing geopolitical tensions (Schmid, 2019;Proelss et al., 2020). REMs evolve towards becoming a stand-alone commodity category, although remaining inherently more vulnerable to geopolitics and, hence, riskier than traditional commodities (Fernandez, 2017;Cox and Kynicky, 2018;Proelss et al., 2020). Therefore, researching the risk spillovers between the REMs market and REMs-dependent markets such as renewable energy industry is highly desirable. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the clean energies sectors have demonstrated their relative resilience vis-à-vis conventional carbon energy producers, the latter being severely impacted by a considerable decay in demand due to pandemic containment measures, including travel and mobility restrictions, lockdown policies and work-from-home practices (Kim and Karpinski, 2020).Notes: This table reports the descriptive statistics and Jarque-Bera (J.-B.) test of the return series for the renewable energy (TECH, RENIXX, ECO, SPGTCED, WIND, and SOLAR) and the rare earths (REMX) indices. ***, **, and * represent statistical significance at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

        <p>Given the importance of this topic, several economics and financial aspects of the REMs and renewable energy markets have been addressed in the literature (McLellan et al., 2013;Baldi et al., 2014;Apergis and Apergis, 2017;Elshkaki, 2021;Watari et al., 2021). All they find that the REMs prices represent a crucial determinant for development of renewable energy capacities. We also point to a few existing scientific studies, which address interconnections between the REMs and the renewable energy companies, such as Fernandez ( 2017 (2021). However, these works while studying the nexus between the REMs and renewable energy companies, in the first place, pay attention to the REMs market. For instance, to the best of our knowledge, just one benchmark for renewable energy industry is commonly employed to describe the whole universe of renewable energy domains. Such approach overlooks the detailed description of the renewable energy subsectors and may result in over-generalized results and conclusions as the performance of one subsector may considerably differ from the other (s).Given the importance of this topic, several economics and financial aspects of the REMs and renewable energy markets have been addressed in the literature (McLellan et al., 2013;Baldi et al., 2014;Apergis and Apergis, 2017;Elshkaki, 2021;Watari et al., 2021).

        <p>Our paper contributes to the academic literature in the two following ways. First, our study represents a contemporaneous forehanded research, based on the historical dataset covering both, the apogee of the trade tensions between US and China in 2019 and the escalation of the COVID-19 crisis with its peak in March 2020, bearing in mind that the joint influence of the mounting US-China trade tensions and of the ongoing pandemic makes highly desirable to revisit earlier empirical findings by means of analyzing a new dynamic between REMs and Second, the dynamic return and volatility connectedness of the REMs index with six renewable energy sectors indices, regarding total and net directional spillovers, is thoroughly explored and the receiver/transmitter role of each market is duly identified. We perform our connectedness analysis for the whole sample period and for the two constituent pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 sub-periods. Thus, differing from previous research (Chen et al., 2020;Reboredo and Ugolini, 2020;Bouri et al., 2021;Song et al., 2021) focused mainly on diverse interrelations between the rare earths markets and other major asset classes, our primary focus is centered on the main renewable energy sub-industries as well as on the risk and volatility spillovers between them and the REMs market within the unique research setup shaped by COVID-19.Our paper contributes to the academic literature in the two following ways.

        <p>Our paper uses the wavelet method that allow one to obtain the results in the form of time-frequency heatmaps containing the information on both coherence and time difference of the studied pairs of indices (Torrence and Compo, 1998;Grinsted et al., 2004;Vacha and Barunik, 2012;Banović et al., 2013;Bredin et al., 2015;Umar and Gubareva, 2020). As an important aspect of the wavelet approach, the wavelet coherence analysis allows providing insights on the joint behavior of indices, not only along the dimension of time, but also over different investment time scales or so-called frequency periods, thus enabling us to study various patterns stock price movements, lead-lag relations, and co-movements. Given the importance of frequency or investment horizon dimension in the context of stock investments, we opt to employ wavelet methods. It is worth noting that the wavelet technique does not require any strong assumption such as stationarity and can be used to capture both linear and non-linear effects. This aspect is especially important while investigating abrupt market movements in the periods of crises when stationarity could be potentially compromised. All the above characterize the wavelet methodology as a robust approach, commonly employed to investigate coherence between various time series (Zaremba et al., 2019;Younis et al., 2020;Gubareva and Umar, 2020;Umar and Gubareva, 2021). To get an accurate and full picture on the relationships between rare earth stock and renewable energy markets, we employ the spillover index approach proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012). This method allows us to identify the size and the direction of spillovers among assets, allowing to identify the source of contagion as it identifies the net receivers and the transmitters of returns and volatility (Umar and Gubareva, 2021).Our paper uses the wavelet method that allow one to obtain the results in the form of time-frequency heatmaps containing the information on both coherence and time difference of the studied pairs of indices (Torrence and Compo, 1998;Grinsted et al., 2004;Vacha and Barunik, 2012;Banović et al., 2013;Bredin et al., 2015;Umar and Gubareva, 2020).

        <p>Our results reveal a high coherence between the REMs and renewable energy markets before the pandemic at intermediate frequency. However, the co-movements increase during the pandemic irrespective of frequencies. In addition, during the pre-COVID-19 period the REMs stocks lead the renewable energy market returns, except for the wind and solar energy sectors. Furthermore, our separate return and volatility transmission study signals that both return and volatility spillovers mostly upsurge from the REMs and influence the renewable energy market with spillover intensities augmenting considerably during the pandemic. In what concerns renewable energy sectors, the clean energy index companies act as the major net transmitter of return spillovers during the whole sample. However, the high growth technology companies take a lead in net volatility transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the REMs and renewable energy indices, are found to be moderately interrelated before the pandemic in both return and volatility perspective. However, they become strongly interconnected during COVID-19, transmitting return and volatility spillovers to each other, and evidencing an increased influence of the REMs companies, especially for volatility transmission.Our results reveal a high coherence between the REMs and renewable energy markets before the pandemic at intermediate frequency.

        <p>The renewable energy sectors are heavily dependent on the REMs, implying that there exists an inherent interdependence between the renewable energy system and the companies involved in REM extraction, production and handling. Therefore, a shift towards renewable energies brings about new challenges related to interrelations between the clean energy and REM markets and to new risks emerging from their connectedness. Several researches have been addressing diverse linkages between the REM and renewable energy industries (Massari and Ruberti, 2013;Baldi et al., 2014;McLellan et al., 2014;Dutta et al., 2016;Apergis and Apergis, 2017;Cox and Kynicky, 2018;Chen and Zheng, 2019;Månberger and Johansson, 2019;Wang et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2020;Proelsset al., 2020;Watari et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2020;Elshkaki, 2021;Hanif et al., 2021;Piarulli et al., 2021;Zheng et al., 2021;Golroudbary et al., 2022).The renewable energy sectors are heavily dependent on the REMs, implying that there exists an inherent interdependence between the renewable energy system and the companies involved in REM extraction, production and handling.

        <p>Several works investigate the interrelations between the REM companies and renewable energy stocks. For example, Baldi et al. (2014) find that the relationship between the selected set of REs and the clean energy index is inverse within the 2006-2012 period. In their turn, Apergis and Apergis (2017) study the joint dynamics of the REM prices and the clean energy consumption within 2004-2016 period and provide empirical evidence of a negative relationship between these two economic aggregates at both the regional and the global scales. In parallel, Fernandez (2017) analyzes historical evolution of rare earths market and finds that low correlation between REM and commodity prices may imply an existence of attractive diversification benefits. In Nonetheless, research, dedicated to studying interrelations between the REM and renewable energy stocks such as Reboredo and Ugolini (2020), Bouri et al. (2021), Song et al. (2021), commonly uses only one benchmark index for proxying the renewable energy industry, namely, the Wilder Hill Clean Energy Index (Bloomberg ticker: ECO Index). Such approach allows for an aggregate, though eventually biased view of the renewable energy system, as it does not permit to duly discriminate between different sub-sectors and lines of businesses of the companies involved into the transition towards cleaner energies. To the best of our knowledge, there exist no previous studies considering the interrelations between the REM and solar energy industry, between the REM and wind energy companies, and so on, and so forth.Several works investigate the interrelations between the REM companies and renewable energy stocks.

        <p>Chen et al. ( 2020) investigate the nexus of crude oil, new energy and rare earth in China, focusing in particular, on spillovers in volatility series among three renowned benchmarks, namely the Brent crude oil price, Mainland new energy index, and the rare earth industry index. They document a high interdependency between new energy and rare earths industries. In addition, Chen et al. ( 2020) conclude that the China's rare earth industry is the major transmitter of volatility spillovers. Reboredo and Ugolini (2020) investigate price transmission between REM companies' stocks and related stock markets, including base metals, clean energies, gold, oil and general stock markets. The authors employ a Markov-switching vector-autoregressive (VAR) model to distinguish between the high-and low-volatility regimes. The authors find that in a low-volatility regime the REM stocks are weakly connected to clean energy stock market, while in a high-volatility regime, they observe an increase in REM price co-movements with price changes in the clean energy sector. Overall, the Authors conclude that the REM stock market always acts as a net recipient of price spillovers with null/limited capacity to originate price spillovers under low-volatility/high-volatility conditions. Their findings provide relevant insights regarding downside risk hedging of REM exposures by investing in stocks of clean energy companies. Using a quantile-based connectedness approach Bouri et al. (2021) explore the connectedness in returns and volatility between return and volatility connectedness between the RE stock index and both clean energy, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and healthcare equipment. The authors show that the relationships between these markets are asymmetric during extreme (lower and upper) quantiles. More importantly, the Focusing on Chinese economy and using Chinese firms' data, Zheng et al. (2021), study asymmetric connectedness and dynamic spillovers between renewable energy and rare earth markets. Authors highlight that there exists potential risk transfer between renewable energy and rare earth sectors of economic activity. Their results demonstrate that at firm level the patterns of risk transmission between renewable energy and rare earth markets alter among firms and along the time. Moreover, employing the methodology of asymmetric spillover measure, authors reveal pessimistic mood, which dominates both markets during the sample period 2012-2020, thus, indicating insufficient confidence in the financing channel of the considered industries. Authors argue that their findings provide useful insights for investors and shareholders in what concerns the adequately informed decision-making about investing in the renewable energy and rare earth production facilities.Chen et al.

( 2020) conclude that the China's rare earth industry is the major transmitter of volatility spillovers. Reboredo and Ugolini (2020) investigate price transmission between REM companies' stocks and related stock markets, including base metals, clean energies, gold, oil and general stock markets. The authors employ a Markov-switching vector-autoregressive (VAR) model to distinguish between the high-and low-volatility regimes. The authors find that in a low-volatility regime the REM stocks are weakly connected to clean energy stock market, while in a high-volatility regime, they observe an increase in REM price co-movements with price changes in the clean energy sector. Overall, the Authors conclude that the REM stock market always acts as a net recipient of price spillovers with null/limited capacity to originate price spillovers under low-volatility/high-volatility conditions. Their findings provide relevant insights regarding downside risk hedging of REM exposures by investing in stocks of clean energy companies. Using a quantile-based connectedness approach Bouri et al. (2021) explore the connectedness in returns and volatility between return and volatility connectedness between the RE stock index and both clean energy, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and healthcare equipment. The authors show that the relationships between these markets are asymmetric during extreme (lower and upper) quantiles. More importantly, the Focusing on Chinese economy and using Chinese firms' data, Zheng et al. (2021), study asymmetric connectedness and dynamic spillovers between renewable energy and rare earth markets. Authors highlight that there exists potential risk transfer between renewable energy and rare earth sectors of economic activity. Their results demonstrate that at firm level the patterns of risk transmission between renewable energy and rare earth markets alter among firms and along the time. Moreover, employing the methodology of asymmetric spillover measure, authors reveal pessimistic mood, which dominates both markets during the sample period 2012-2020, thus, indicating insufficient confidence in the financing channel of the considered industries. Authors argue that their findings provide useful insights for investors and shareholders in what concerns the adequately informed decision-making about investing in the renewable energy and rare earth production facilities.</p>
        <p>Being interested in a worldwide, rather than regional, context, Golroudbary et al. ( 2022), analyze the global environmental cost of using rare earth elements in green energy technologies. Authors claim that generation of green energy must be analyzed through the prism of global perspectives bearing in mind a broad environmental scenario. Their results based on the dataset covering the period 2010-2020, permit to conclude that an increase of green energy production by 1% causes 0.18% depletion of rare earths' reserves and increases greenhouse gas emissions in the exploitation phase by 0.90%. Therefore, authors claim that new approaches to decarbonization are extremely necessary to assure sustainability of this process. Their outcomes underscore an urgency to develop and implement diverse metrics, which would allow increasing the recycling of rare earths materials and eventually substituting them by other materials by means of innovative technologies to be fostered in the nearest future. Authors argues that these metrics would help to design appropriate strategies for decarbonization and environmentally sustainable development of renewable energy technologies.Being interested in a worldwide, rather than regional, context, Golroudbary et al.

        <p>The above literature survey evidences the two lacunas, existing in the previous research. The first shortcoming is related to the fact that while studying the nexus between the REM and renewable energy stock markets, the main emphasis is paid to the REM companies. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, solely one benchmark is used to describe the whole spectrum of business diversity within the renewable energy industry. Such approach seems to lack a capacity to provide the detailed description of the renewable energy subsectors and may result in somewhat biased results, hence, not appropriate for designing elaborate hedge strategies. For instance, we believe that research financial community will benefit from the possibility to have a more granular information, e.g., on the interrelations between the REM and solar energy industry, between the REM and wind energy companies, among other subsectors of the contemporary renewable energy system. Our research aspires to fill this gap, as we employ six different benchmark indices to proxy the renewable energy subsectors in our quest to decipher intricate interrelations between the variety of renewable energy companies and REM stocks.The above literature survey evidences the two lacunas, existing in the previous research.

        <p>The second gap is related to a usually observed reliance on a single chosen methodology, which predominantly is the forecast-error variance decomposition based on VAR techniques. However, this approach ignores the perspective of investment horizons. Given the importance of frequency or investment horizon dimension in the context of stock investments, we opt to employ wavelet time-frequency analysis as a complementary methodology to provide confirmation to our results obtained within the VAR-supported variance decomposition framework and vice-versa. It is worth noting that the wavelet technique does not require any strong assumption such as stationarity and can be used to capture both linear and non-linear effects. This aspect is especially important while investigating abrupt market movements in the periods of crises when stationarity could be potentially compromised. Hence, our paper provides a cross-confirmation of our results, serving as a robustness check and allowing for deeper insights due to availability of the two distinct perspectives.The second gap is related to a usually observed reliance on a single chosen methodology, which predominantly is the forecast-error variance decomposition based on VAR techniques.

        <p>The sample period spans from January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020, yielding the 620 daily observations. Our sample period covers the rapid expansion of Covid-19 virulent disease in early 2020 becoming the pandemic and causing the health and economic crisis around the globe. The choice of daily data is justified by our focus on abrupt market movements caused by the rapid advancement of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak crisis. Our data sample allows investigating pairwise coherence and co-movements of the analyzed markets as well as modeling the connectedness and spillovers between rare earth metals and renewable energy stocks before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The whole period is subdivided into two sub-periods: pre-COVID-19 sub-sample: January 1, 2018, to November 29, 2019, the COVID-19 sub-sample: November 30, 2019, to the end of the sample period. The selection of the sub-periods is based on the first reported COVID-19 case in Wuhan, Hubei, People's Republic of China, in November 2019.The sample period spans from January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020, yielding the 620 daily observations.

        <p>Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the daily returns of the renewable energy and REM stocks. We observe that average returns are positive only for the two indices, namely, SuperTech (TECH) Index and World Renewable Energy Industrial (RENIXX) Index. We also note that the wind energy (WIND Index) and solar energy (SOLAR Index) stocks as well as stocks of the RE companies (REMX Index) consistently exhibit negative return mean for the whole sample as well as for each of the subsamples. The downtrend in returns of the RE stocks along the whole sample period could be attributed to the mounting tensions between the US and China with the RE minerals in the center of the US-China trade war, which caused the reduction in outbound shipments of rare earths from China in 2020. Another factor of slowdown in production and downstream operations is related to the changes in international market demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the daily returns of the renewable energy and REM stocks.

        <p>Only two indices, TECH and RENIXX, are consistently negatively skewed. In their turn, the RE stocks switch from low but still positive pre-COVID-19 skewness of 0.06 to negative skewness of -0.67 during the COVID-19 sub-sample period. Based on the kurtosis values we notice that there exist two distinct types of stock. The four indices, -TECH, RENIXX, ECO, and SPGTCED, -are characterized by excess kurtosis, suggesting leptokurtic distributions with fat tails, while the other three, -REMX, WIND, and SOLAR, -exhibit kurtosis values below 3, implying that their return distributions may be closer to the normal distribution function. We associate this kurtosis-wise similarity between the RE and the wind and solar industries to the heavy dependence of the two latter on the former. However, further research of the mechanism at play are highly desirable. Nonetheless, the null hypothesis of normality is rejected for all series at the 1% level, as indicated by the results of Jarque-Bera test statistics.Only two indices, TECH and RENIXX, are consistently negatively skewed.

        <p>We present the correlation coefficients in Table 2. It is worth noting that during the pre-COVID-19 period all the correlations are positive. However, during the COVID-19 the correlation coefficients between the SuperTech stocks, on the one hand, and the solar and wind companies' equities, on the other hand become negative, presumably due to the decaying price of crude oil turning the two letter sectors economically uncompetitive. Moreover, for all the three samples, the REM companies' (Gubareva, 2021). However, the wind and solar sector indices, contrasting the four other renewable energy aggregates, exhibit downtrend along the whole sample period. The REMX index, which is our benchmark for the REM companies' stocks, also exhibits downtrend along the whole period. In all the seven returns' plots we observe an abrupt decay followed by the bouncing back dynamics, with the lowest point being March 23, 2020, being this the apogee of the pandemic caused meltdown of the global financial markets. For the six renewable energy indices we see a negative spike-like behavior, while spike features are rather absent in the case of REMX index. We ascribe this divergence to the fact that the REM market has been being heavily depressed due to the proper market structure and demand-supply-risk conjuncture, to the point that event COVID-19 has not been able to further worsen the situation in a considerable manner. We posit, that a rather long-term nature of the REM contracts and a considerable time elapsed for outbound shipment time from China to the Western economies have been smoothing the price dynamics of the companies involved in this business. However, towards the end of the sample, all the indices, expect the wind and solar industries' stocks, exhibit upward trends associated with the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis lows. The influence of the outbreak is also noticeable while observing the right column of Fig. 1, which depicts the return dynamics. We clearly see that the solar, wind and REM indices are notably more volatile than the four first renewable energy stocks described by the TECH, RENIXX, ECO, and SPGTCED indices. If analyzed more closely, one easily concludes that the most volatile time interval for all the seven indices is related to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this manner, by our empiric analysis we expect corroborate this insight that the pandemic outbreak has adversely affected both the renewable energy and the REM companies' valuations and to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the return and volatility spillovers between the considered stock markets.We present the correlation coefficients in Table 2.

        <p>In line with the sequence of the presentation of the employed methodologies, we present our empirical results following the same order, i.e., starting with the squared wavelet coherence results and the cross wavelet transform analysis and, then, continuing with the results from the forecast-error variance decomposition approach applied to investigate the static and dynamic connectedness and spillovers both in returns and volatility. We argue that such order allows first to get an overall helicopter-like view of the situation based on the wavelet heatmaps, and then to analyze the relationships in more detail my means of return and volatility spillovers metrics presented in the form of tables as well as make use of time varying connectedness charts.In line with the sequence of the presentation of the employed methodologies, we present our empirical results following the same order, i.e., starting with the squared wavelet coherence results and the cross wavelet transform analysis and, then, continuing with the results from the forecast-error variance decomposition approach applied to investigate the static and dynamic connectedness and spillovers both in returns and volatility.

        <p>Fig. 2 displays the twelve pairwise SWC plots indicating the extent of correlations between REM companies' stocks and six major benchmarks used to prosy the performance of the stocks of the renewable energy sectors. The concept of SWC is similar to the square of the traditional correlation. That is, the squared correlation values lie between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no correlation and is shown by the blue color on the SWC plot, whereas1 denotes high correlation and is shown by the red droplets on the SWC plot. The arrows in coherence plot represent the lead/lag and in-phase/anti-phase relationships. The east-and westfacing arrows show positive and negative correlations, respectively. The frequency is covered in days.Fig. 2 displays the twelve pairwise SWC plots indicating the extent of correlations between REM companies' stocks and six major benchmarks used to prosy the performance of the stocks of the renewable energy sectors.

        <p>In the left-hand column of Fig. 2 we provide the six pairwise SWC plots for the pre-COVID-19 period, while in the right-hand column the six pairwise SWC plots for the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. The right down or left up pointing arrows signify that the first series, i.e., the REM market is leading, while the right up or left down pointing arrows show that the second series (in our case one of the renewable energy stock indices) is leading. During the pre-COVID-19 period, for the 1-to-2month frequency range, we document that the REMX index predominantly leads the stocks of the companies active in renewable energy industry, except for the solar and wind sector stocks, which lag behind by the REM companies' stocks. In addition, during the 2018, for the 2-to-8-week frequency range we observe for each of the six plots the red regions, implying the high coherence between the analyzed time series. We attribute this integration between the markets to the common cause being it the mounting China-US tensions regarding the REMs and being in the very center of the China-US trade war. However, in 2019 the overall tonality becomes colder with diminishing red and growing blue zones. It is also worth noting that among the pre-COVID-19 heatmap, the REMX-SOLAR and REMX-WIND panels are predominantly blue colored along the whole pre-COVID-19 period, signaling a low coherence between the time-series, and, hence, evidencing attractive diversification benefit subjacent to joint investment in these pairs of the respective sectors of economic activities.In the left-hand column of Fig. 2 we provide the six pairwise SWC plots for the pre-COVID-19 period, while in the right-hand column the six pairwise SWC plots for the COVID-19 pandemic are presented.

In addition, during the 2018, for the 2-to-8-week frequency range we observe for each of the six plots the red regions, implying the high coherence between the analyzed time series. We attribute this integration between the markets to the common cause being it the mounting China-US tensions regarding the REMs and being in the very center of the China-US trade war. However, in 2019 the overall tonality becomes colder with diminishing red and growing blue zones. It is also worth noting that among the pre-COVID-19 heatmap, the REMX-SOLAR and REMX-WIND panels are predominantly blue colored along the whole pre-COVID-19 period, signaling a low coherence between the time-series, and, hence, evidencing attractive diversification benefit subjacent to joint investment in these pairs of the respective sectors of economic activities.</p>
        <p>In what concerns the COVID-19 period, as per Fig. 2, for the below-2week frequency range, since February 2020 onwards we see the welldefined red regions evidencing high levels of the pairwise coherence for all the analyzed sectorial pairs. This high coherence phenomenon is clearly related to the impact of the COVID-19 market meltdown in February-March 2020. Our empirical findings on SWC between REM companies' stocks and renewable energy sector stocks provide relevant insights for potential investors in REM companies. For instance, under relatively normal market conditions, such as observed during the pre-COVID-19 period, investors holding positions in REM companies may harvest hedging benefits from attractive diversification opportunities provided by join investment in the REM and the low-integrated with REM renewable energy stocks. Still, as we evidence by our analysis, such hedging strategies may become not feasible in the periods of global crises, as during the COVID-19 pandemic their efficiency has been impaired by high levels of pairwise coherence between all the analyzed equity markets.In what concerns the COVID-19 period, as per Fig. 2, for the below-2week frequency range, since February 2020 onwards we see the welldefined red regions evidencing high levels of the pairwise coherence for all the analyzed sectorial pairs.

        <p>For an in-depth analysis, we turn to consideration of the cross wavelet transform. The advantage of this technique is that it preserves the information about the phase. It is worth noting that arrows indicating phase information help us to better comprehend the relationships between the analyzed pairs of markets. Fig. 3 presents twelve crosswavelet transform heatmaps; six in the left-hand column for the pre-COVID-19 and six in the right-hand for the COVID-19 periods. We clearly see a certain similarity of the patterns within each of columns. In the left-hand pre-COVID-19 column, we observe that though there is positive covariance or in-phase relationship it is localized within the 1to-8-week frequency band and is reasonably well concentrated along the time scale around the end of 2018/the beginning of the 2019.For an in-depth analysis, we turn to consideration of the cross wavelet transform.

        <p>However, in the right-hand COVID-19 column we see that the regions of positive covariance or in-phase relationship starts from the 1day frequency and are especially well-defined for the 1-to-3-week frequency range. Our results allow us to conclude the following. Even if there is significant covariance between the different time series, under the relatively normal pre-COVID-19 market conditions, it substantially varies between the shorter and longer cycles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the covariance patterns become more homogeneous, indicating significant covariance between the REM and renewable energy stocks across the whole range of considered frequencies, alerting in this way of diminishing diversification opportunities during global crisis events such as the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. In order to validate our findings based on the wavelet analysis, we now turn to alternative but complementary approach based on forecast-error variance decomposition.However, in the right-hand COVID-19 column we see that the regions of positive covariance or in-phase relationship starts from the 1day frequency and are especially well-defined for the 1-to-3-week frequency range.

        <p>In Table 3, we present the results of the static spillover analysis of the return series in the system composed of the six renewable energy stock indices (TECH, RENIXX, ECO, SPGTCED, WIND, and SOLAR) and the stock index for the REM (REMX) for the three analyzed time intervals: full sample, pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. We find that overall moderate connectedness in the system during the pre-COVID-19 period (52.44%) increases to a considerably higher level (69.65%) during the COVID-19 times. While comparing the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 sub-samples, we observe that the diagonal elements of own variance are diminishing, becoming all below 40% during the latter period.In Table 3, we present the results of the static spillover analysis of the return series in the system composed of the six renewable energy stock indices (TECH, RENIXX, ECO, SPGTCED, WIND, and SOLAR) and the stock index for the REM (REMX) for the three analyzed time intervals: full sample, pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods.

        <p>Therefore, the contribution to each index's variance during COVID-19 is more affected by the return spillovers form other indices than by its own variance, implying that the overall connectedness in the system increases.Therefore, the contribution to each index's variance during COVID-19 is more affected by the return spillovers form other indices than by its own variance, implying that the overall connectedness in the system increases.</p>
        <p>In addition, in Table 3, we show that for all the three periods the largest contributions to the system are originated from the Clean Energy (ECO) index companies ' stocks being, respectively, 85.69, 77.74, and 89.23 percent. This finding also holds for pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 sub-samples regarding the influence of the ECO index at REMX index: 14.77 and 15.66 percent, respectively. Coming back to the row "Directional to Others" we document that, for the three analyzed periods, the REM companies' stocks are those that less contribute to system (42.24%, 28.03%, and 48.48%). Moreover, analyzing the "Directional Connectedness" row we see that for all the three periods the REMX index acts as a net receiver of influence from the system: 13.49%, -23.12%, and -17.27%. This is a rather unexpected result as the REMX index members-constituents produce the basis inputs for the renewable energy industries. Hence, further research into this subject is highly desirable. In general lines, these our findings evidence that in time of financial turmoil, such as COVID-19-triggered meltdown, the return of the stock indices exhibit higher levels of connectedness and corroborate with the conclusions of Reboredo and Ugolini (2020) and Song et al. (2021). However, considering six benchmarks for the renewable energy companies' performance, we provide more details on interrelations of the REM stocks with renewable energy stocks, ignored in the former study and proxied just by one Clean Energy (ECO) index in the latter.In addition, in Table 3, we show that for all the three periods the largest contributions to the system are originated from the Clean Energy (ECO) index companies ' stocks being, respectively, 85.69, 77.74, and 89.23 percent.

        <p>Table 4 presents the results of the static connectedness analysis of the volatility series in the system for the three time-intervals: full sample, pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. As shown in this table, we find that overall moderate connectedness in the system during the pre-COVID-19 period (48.44%) increases to a much higher level (76.39%) during the COVID-19 times. It is worth noting that volatility connectedness is lower (higher) that return connectedness during the pre-COVID-19 (COVID-19) period: 48.44% &lt; 52.44% during the pre-COVID times and 76.39% &gt; 69.65% during the COVID-19 pandemic). In line with the returns' series case, while comparing the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 sub-samples, we observe that the diagonal elements of own variance are diminishing, becoming all below 40% during the latter period. Therefore, the contribution to each index's variance during COVID-19 is more affected by the volatility spillovers form other indices than by its own variance, implying that the overall connectedness in the system increases.Table 4 presents the results of the static connectedness analysis of the volatility series in the system for the three time-intervals: full sample, pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods.

        <p>In addition, in Table 4, we see that for the whole sample period the largest contribution from the system is directed to the REMX index companies' stocks (71.38%) while the same REMX index transmits the lowest influence to system (33.89%). Notable the REMX index appears as the least important receiver of the volatility shocks from the system during the COVID-19 period (66.2%). This is somewhat expected result as the REMX index members-constituents produce the basis inputs for the renewable energy industries, and hence, should not be so sensitive to the volatility of the results of their customers. Our findings regarding volatility connectedness, based on six benchmarks for the stocks of the renewable energy companies, considerably enhance previous studies, namely, Reboredo and Ugolini (2020) and Song et al. (2021), as the former does not address the volatility connectedness at all, and as the latter uses just one Clean Energy (ECO) index for benchmarking the renewable energy stock performance, ignoring the existing variety within the renewable energy industries. We observe that the respective indices exhibit higher levels of connectedness during the period of global crises. Our finding is in line with those of Reboredo and Ugolini (2020) and Song et al. (2021). We conclude that an abrupt increase in March 2020 signals of the increased level of integration among the return series (Panel A) as well as among the volatility series (Panel B). We ascribe this increased connectedness to unprecedented uncertainty, affected the global economy and financial markets through the worldwide implementation of lockdown policies, which resulted in disruptions of the supply chains of the renewable energy industries (Kim and Karpinski, 2020;Gubareva, 2021;Gubareva et al., 2022).In addition, in Table 4, we see that for the whole sample period the largest contribution from the system is directed to the REMX index companies' stocks (71.38%) while the same REMX index transmits the lowest influence to system (33.89%).

        <p>This study investigates the frequency comovements and spillovers (in returns and volatility) between one rare earth index (REMX Index) and six important renewable energy indices namely SuperTech Index, World Renewable Energy Industrial Index, WilderHill Clean Energy Index, S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index, NYSE Bloomberg Global Wind Energy Index, and NYSE Bloomberg Global Solar Energy Index. The wavelet-based approach and the spillover index methodology from January 1, 2018 to May 15, 2020 are used to achieve the objectives.This study investigates the frequency comovements and spillovers (in returns and volatility) between one rare earth index (REMX Index) and six important renewable energy indices namely SuperTech Index, World Renewable Energy Industrial Index, WilderHill Clean Energy Index, S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index, NYSE Bloomberg Global Wind Energy Index, and NYSE Bloomberg Global Solar Energy Index.

        <p>The results of the wavelet analysis provide empirical evidence that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the covariance patterns become more homogeneous, indicating significant increase in covariance between the REM and renewable energy stocks across the whole range of considered frequencies. Thus, our results alert investors of diminishing diversification opportunities during global crisis events such as the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. In its turn, the forecast-error variance decomposition approach allows us to conclude that the REM stocks always, for all the considered periods, remain net recipient of innovation from the system for both the return and volatility time-series, with a limited capacity to transmit respective spillover effects to the system independently of the analyzed period. Nonetheless, we document a considerable increase in transmission of return and volatility shocks by the REM stocks during the pandemic. In particular, for both, return and volatility series, it is found that the contribution to each index's variance during COVID-19 is more affected by the respective spillovers form other indices than by its own variance, implying that the overall connectedness in the system increases. In addition, the dynamic return and volatility spillover indices allow us to conclude that the COVID-19-triggered market meltdown in February-March 2020 caused an abrupt from 50% to 80% increase in time varying connectedness in the system, both in returns and volatility. Therefore it is evidenced that the turbulent market conditions, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, result in increasing integration of the REM and renewable energy markets.The results of the wavelet analysis provide empirical evidence that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the covariance patterns become more homogeneous, indicating significant increase in covariance between the REM and renewable energy stocks across the whole range of considered frequencies.

        <p>The evolving return and volatility spillovers reveals a necessity for investors to consider adopting dynamic hedge strategies to mitigate the risk spillovers between the REM and renewable energy stock exposures as scarcer opportunities for diversification by means of joint investments in these two markets remain in the periods of crisis. Hence, in response to our newly reported findings, a pursuit of innovative downside-risk hedge strategies for REM and renewable energy stock exposures might represent new lines for future investigation, which may be potentially useful for investors as well as market regulators and resources policy makers.The evolving return and volatility spillovers reveals a necessity for investors to consider adopting dynamic hedge strategies to mitigate the risk spillovers between the REM and renewable energy stock exposures as scarcer opportunities for diversification by means of joint investments in these two markets remain in the periods of crisis.
