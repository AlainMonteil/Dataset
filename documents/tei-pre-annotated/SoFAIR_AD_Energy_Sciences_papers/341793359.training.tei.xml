        <p>Governments around the globe are responding to the COVID-19-related economic crisis with unprecedented economic recovery packages (1) which at the time of writing surpassed USD 12 trillion. Several influential voices, including the UN Secretary-General, heads of state, companies, investors, and central banks, have called for post-COVID-19 economic recovery efforts to be used to catalyze the necessary longer-term transformation towards a more sustainable and resilient society. Here we shine a light on the opportunity for these investments to support a green recovery by inventorying and classifying the latest information on governments' fiscal stimulus plans (1) and comparing the size of these measures to estimates of low-carbon energy investment needs compatible with the 2015 UN Paris Agreement. We show that low-carbon investments to put the world on an ambitious track towards net zero carbon-dioxide emissions by mid-century are dwarfed by currently announced COVID-19 stimulus. But marked differences across countries and regions at differing stages of development emphasize the role international support and global partnership must play in order to create conditions that enable a global climate-positive recovery.Governments around the globe are responding to the COVID-19-related economic crisis with unprecedented economic recovery packages (1) which at the time of writing surpassed USD 12 trillion.

        <p>Current climate commitments by countries for the next decade remain woefully inadequate to meet the climate goals spelled out in the Paris Agreement (2). Decisive action in the coming decade would be needed to set the emissions of the most important greenhouse gas -carbon dioxide -on a path to net zero by mid-century (3), while simultaneously ensuring that livelihoods of billions of people in developing countries continue to improve. The record decline in global greenhouse gas emissions in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19related economic disruption will almost certainly rebound when economic activity picks up again, and could ultimately have a negligible impact on global warming over the longer term -unless COVID-19 recovery also induces a longer-term structural change in the economy (4).Current climate commitments by countries for the next decade remain woefully inadequate to meet the climate goals spelled out in the Paris Agreement (2).

        <p>Governments have announced a variety of policy responses aimed at alleviating the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis (1). We focus on economic stimulus tools deployed explicitly through countries' fiscal systems, taking stock of the packages for 149 countries (see Supplementary Materials -SM, Table S1). As of end of August 2020, our tracking framework showed aggregate fiscal stimuli amounting to USD 12.2 trillion, 80% of which comes from OECD countries (Fig. 1,S1). The US stimulus is the largest single package to date, comprising a quarter of all global commitments, although the EU as a bloc accounts for even more (combining measures by national governments and the European Commission).Governments have announced a variety of policy responses aimed at alleviating the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis (1).

        <p>Our disaggregation of the packages for this analysis follows the approach of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose COVID-19 Policy Tracker is the source for our stimulus data (1). Stimulus packages are divided into two categories: "above-the-line" measures and liquidity support. The former includes additional spending and forgone or deferred revenue, while the latter includes instruments such as loans, guarantees, and equity injections. About 70% of stimulus can be classified as "above-the-line" measures, with 7% targeted for the health sector and 63% percent for other sectors. The remaining 30% is for liquidity support.Our disaggregation of the packages for this analysis follows the approach of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose COVID-19 Policy Tracker is the source for our stimulus data (1).

        <p>The level of specification of countries' stimulus packages varies widely, limiting understanding of the explicit targets governments will aim to achieve with their plans. Although several governments have announced their intentions to earmark portions of their packages for a "green recovery", the exact details remain largely unclear and most governments have not yet signaled Andrijevic M., Schleussner C.-F., Gidden M., McCollum D. and Rogelj J. (2020). "COVID-19 recovery funds dwarf clean energy investment needs." Science 4 how they intend to spend their money. This uncertainty notwithstanding, the massive influx of support will be consequential in shaping the post-pandemic global economy.The level of specification of countries' stimulus packages varies widely, limiting understanding of the explicit targets governments will aim to achieve with their plans.

        <p>We demonstrate the potential impact that current stimulus could have for a low-carbon energy system transformation. Although such a transformation requires a wide array of policy measures to come to fruition, the spending and liquidity support being put forward can be a powerful catalyst for a climate-positive recovery.We demonstrate the potential impact that current stimulus could have for a low-carbon energy system transformation.

        <p>Quantitative modeling studies of pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement agree that a low-carbon transformation is predicated on decarbonizing the production and use of energy (3,5,6), responsible for about two-thirds of economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions. To meet the Paris goals, energy supply would need to fully decarbonize by mid-century, if not before (3,5,6). Aggregate stimulus estimates (1), green recovery scenarios (7), or suggestions for green recovery policy packages (8) have been published, among a plethora of analyses related to the pandemic. We compare the magnitude of COVID-19 recovery stimulus to the levels of energy system investment required for putting the world on a path toward achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement (5), based on the average estimate across six energy-economy models that were included in the recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (3). While individual model estimates can differ by up to ±50%, the conclusions deriving from our analysis are nevertheless robust.Quantitative modeling studies of pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement agree that a low-carbon transformation is predicated on decarbonizing the production and use of energy (3,5,6), responsible for about two-thirds of economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

        <p>The crucial insight emerging from this comparison (Fig. 1) is the following: low-carbon investments over the next several years to put the world on track towards net zero carbondioxide emissions by mid-century are dwarfed by COVID-19 stimulus. While impressive, a closer look at the numbers points to opportunities as well as challenges.The crucial insight emerging from this comparison (Fig. 1) is the following: low-carbon investments over the next several years to put the world on track towards net zero carbondioxide emissions by mid-century are dwarfed by COVID-19 stimulus.

        <p>Average annual low-carbon energy and end-use energy efficiency investment needs under a Paris-compatible pathway have been estimated at about 1.4 trillion USD per year globally over the near term between 2020 and 2024 (3,5). This yearly estimate of low-carbon energy investments amounts to some 10% of the total pledged COVID-19 stimulus to date (Fig. 1, S3, S4), or about half of stimulus when investments are cumulated over the five-year 2020-2024 period. Given that stimulus is expected to be spent over the course of a few fiscal years only and governments have traditionally played a minority role in energy investment globally, the potential for the current tranche of public funding to support a green recovery over the next years is thus enormous.Average annual low-carbon energy and end-use energy efficiency investment needs under a Paris-compatible pathway have been estimated at about 1.4 trillion USD per year globally over the near term between 2020 and 2024 (3,5).

        <p>The comparison between stimulus funding and low-carbon energy investment needs becomes sharper when concentrating specifically on those investments above and beyond a non-Pariscompatible trajectory, like the one society has been on up to now. About 1.1 trillion USD per year of low-carbon energy investment has been estimated for such a non-Paris path, together with an accompanying 1.1 trillion USD in fossil. These amounts would ensure sufficient infrastructure and technology deployment for global energy demand to be met, yet still tilting toward a rather weak, pre-COVID climate policy environment worldwide (3,5). The additional investment needed to shift low-carbon energy investment onto a Paris-compatible pathway thus amounts to about 300 billion USD per year globally over the coming five years (Fig. 1, S5-7), less than 3% of total pledged stimulus to date or 15% when considered over the entire 2020-2024 period. Simply put, if even a fraction of current government stimulus would be directed in a responsible manner toward a green recovery, the marginal benefits for a low-carbon future could be considerable.The comparison between stimulus funding and low-carbon energy investment needs becomes sharper when concentrating specifically on those investments above and beyond a non-Pariscompatible trajectory, like the one society has been on up to now.

        <p>Despite the order of magnitude difference in these numbers, there is an important additional part to this story: increases in low-carbon investments have to be accompanied by divestments from high-carbon fossil-fuels in the range of 280 billion USD per year over the same near-term period. These divestments are distinct from the possible removal of fossil-fuel subsidies, which also range in the hundreds of billions of USD but mainly target consumption instead of production of fossil fuels (9). Subtracting divestments from investments indicates that the overall increase in net annual investments to achieve an ambitious low-carbon transformation in the energy sector are remarkably small (Fig. S3): about 20 additional billion USD per year globally. This represents a mere 0.2% of the total announced stimulus to date (compare Fig. S5 to S1), or 1% over the 2020-2024 period. These numbers highlight that a climate-positive COVID-19 recovery relies as much on supporting green investments as it does on avoiding lock-in in brown ones. Of course, not all stimulus should be expected to go into the energy transition. Our analysis indicates that, understandably, significant shares of "above-the-line" measures are earmarked for other sectors, such as health and financial relief for individuals and households. Moreover, governments are typically only responsible for a limited share of investment in low-carbon energy across the world (10). What governments can do, though, is mobilize private investment by channeling stimulus into dedicated public financing mechanisms. For example, liquidity measures for development banks can help them to proactively support low-carbon investments, particularly in developing countries, and through that reduce perceived risks faced by private investors (11).Despite the order of magnitude difference in these numbers, there is an important additional part to this story: increases in low-carbon investments have to be accompanied by divestments from high-carbon fossil-fuels in the range of 280 billion USD per year over the same near-term period.

        <p>Beyond the global situation, we find that when looking more regionally, total stimulus in all cases exceeds annual low-carbon energy investment needs for an ambitious Paris-compatible pathway (Figs S8, S9; we here look at macro regions as defined in Table S2 and which are often used in energy-economy modeling). However, clear differences exist between regions and countries. The EU and US have issued the largest stimulus packages globally, both in Developing economies are in a different situation.

        <p>Institutionalizing international support within intergovernmental systems such as the Green Climate Fund of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or multilateral development banks could help to solidify the partnerships needed to enable a global climatepositive recovery. Furthermore, targeted financial instruments, like blended finance, have also been suggested as a means to increase low-carbon investment flows to developing countries (11,13). Blended finance uses government, multilateral, or philanthropic money to lower the risk for private investors and therewith mobilize additional private investments in developing countries. International support of only a small fraction of current COVID-19 stimulus could thus already provide a lever to catalyze a low-carbon transformation in this first half of the decade.Institutionalizing international support within intergovernmental systems such as the Green Climate Fund of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or multilateral development banks could help to solidify the partnerships needed to enable a global climatepositive recovery.

        <p>In the context of a post-crisis recovery, governments will be looking for stimulus measures that can boost employment, scale rapidly, and increase societies' resilience to future shocks. Targeting a green transformation of the energy system as the proverbial engine of the economy can provide such ancillary benefits. Investment in clean energy has been identified as a driver of employment (7,14); it can also spur innovation and diffusion of technologies across borders -an essential catalyst for low-carbon transformations of economies worldwide (15).In the context of a post-crisis recovery, governments will be looking for stimulus measures that can boost employment, scale rapidly, and increase societies' resilience to future shocks.

        <p>Renewable energy investments have demonstrated a large potential for job creation and often offer a more desirable risk profile for investors (14). Technologies like solar photovoltaics and wind turbines are of a small, modular size that allows for a more rapid upscaling of production and much shorter project lead times. By serving as a clear signal to investors, green recovery packages also reduce the likelihood of stranded assets. In contrast, brown recovery packages that include unconditional oil and gas company bailouts may serve to increase the number of assets that will someday be stranded.Renewable energy investments have demonstrated a large potential for job creation and often offer a more desirable risk profile for investors (14).

        <p>Estimating current and future energy investment flows is not an exact science. Private and publicly-traded companies, governments, stated-owned enterprises, and households are not required to report such information to statistical gathering organizations in all cases. For this reason, the numbers must be back-calculated based on physical quantities, such as gigawatts of installed power plant capacity. Energy efficiency investments are the most uncertain, largely owing to definitional issues (what exactly is the energy-related part of a demand-side device, such as a consumer appliance?). Organizations like the International Energy Agency have adopted a certain set of methodologies; global integrated assessment models do similar. Importantly, base-year uncertainties can contribute to differences in future year projections, especially further out in time (e.g., 2050). Fortunately, for this analysis, which focuses on the near-term period of 2020-2024 (i.e., a single model time-step for all but one of the models relied upon here), the differences across models are relatively small. Moreover, despite the lack of temporal granularity of these models (i.e., no annual or sub-annual timesteps), one of their acknowledged strengths is that they permit the analysis of near-term system responses in the context of long-term goals. This is as much true for fuel-technology mixes and greenhouse gas emissions as it is for investments (in dollar terms), even if the latter is less often the focus of IAM research.Estimating current and future energy investment flows is not an exact science.

        <p>• "Above-the-line" measures which contain mostly spending measures, and which are further divided into those aimed at supporting the health sector (in figures labeled as Health sector spending) and those intended for all other sectors of the economy (in figures labeled General spending), which include supporting individuals, households and businesses, as well as forgone and deferred revenue. • Liquidity measures, which including loans, guarantees and quasi-fiscal operations (labeled Liquidity support).• "Above-the-line" measures which contain mostly spending measures, and which are further divided into those aimed at supporting the health sector (in figures labeled as Health sector spending) and those intended for all other sectors of the economy (in figures labeled General spending), which include supporting individuals, households and businesses, as well as forgone and deferred revenue. • Liquidity measures, which including loans, guarantees and quasi-fiscal operations (labeled Liquidity support).</p>
        <p>In absence of specific sectoral allocations, all announced stimulus is classified as General spending. We do not account for governments' announcements to channel funds into international assistance, nor the recovery funds agreed between governments and the international finance institutions.

        <p>OECD+ countries (see table S2 for the full definition) add up to USD ~10000 billion Fig. 1; Fig. S1 About 70% of stimulus can be classified as "above-the-line" measures, with 7% targeted for the health sector and 63% percent for other sectors.

        <p>We focus on the global stimulus estimate (left panel on Fig. 1, and right-most panel on Fig. S1) Fig. 1; Fig. S1 Average annual low-carbon energy and efficiency investments under a Paris-compatible pathway have been estimated at about 1.4 trillion USD per year globally over the near term between 2020 and 2024 (3,5). This yearly estimate amounts to some 10% of the total pledged COVID-19 stimulus to date (Fig. 1,S3,S4).We focus on the global stimulus estimate (left panel on Fig. 1, and right-most panel on Fig. S1) Fig. 1; Fig. S1 Average annual low-carbon energy and efficiency investments under a Paris-compatible pathway have been estimated at about 1.4 trillion USD per year globally over the near term between 2020 and 2024 (3,5).

        <p>The additional investment needed to shift low-carbon energy investment onto a Paris-compatible pathway thus amounts to about 300 billion USD per year globally over the coming five years (Fig. 1, S5-7), less than 3% of total pledged stimulus to date or 15% when considered over the entire 2020-2024 periodThe additional investment needed to shift low-carbon energy investment onto a Paris-compatible pathway thus amounts to about 300 billion USD per year globally over the coming five years (Fig. 1, S5-7), less than 3% of total pledged stimulus to date or 15% when considered over the entire 2020-2024 period</p>
        <p>[…] Despite the order of magnitude difference in these numbers, there is an important additional part to this story: increases in low-carbon investments would have to be accompanied by divestments from high-carbon fossil-fuels in the range of 280 billion USD per year over the same near-term period.[…] Despite the order of magnitude difference in these numbers, there is an important additional part to this story: increases in low-carbon investments would have to be accompanied by divestments from high-carbon fossil-fuels in the range of 280 billion USD per year over the same near-term period.</p>
        <p>[…] Subtracting divestments from investments indicates that the overall in-crease in net annual investments to achieve an ambitious low-carbon trans-formation in the energy sector are remarkably small (Fig. S3): about 20 additional billion USD per year globally. This represents a mere 0.2% of the total announced stimulus to date (compare Fig. S5 Developing economies are in a different situation. So far, the combined stimulus available to low and lower-middle income countries amounts to only a tiny fraction (less than 4%) of total global stimulus and even including upper-middle income Here we aggregate stimulus over the four income groups as classified by the World Bank and express it as a share of the global stimulus. See table S4 for each group's numbers. S4 economies raises this share to 14% only. These numbers exclude potential international support, which to date remains negligibly small compared to the pledged national COVID-19 stimulus. This discrepancy will not only affect developing countries' ability to recover from the COVID-19 crisis but also the world's collective ability to achieve the Paris Agreement climate goals.[…] Subtracting divestments from investments indicates that the overall in-crease in net annual investments to achieve an ambitious low-carbon trans-formation in the energy sector are remarkably small (Fig. S3): about 20 additional billion USD per year globally.

That study calculated demandside energy efficiency investments across the end-use sectors (buildings, transport, industry) in a harmonized way for each of the global models. The calculations take into account two separate, additive components: (1) base-year energy efficiency and (2) supply-side offset.fossil fuels: extraction and conversion of fossil fuels, electricity from fossil fuels without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies and hydrogen from fossil fuels • low carbon sources: extraction and conversion of nuclear energy, CCS, electricity from non-bio renewables, hydrogen from non-fossil fuels, extraction and conversion of bioenergy, electricity transmission and distribution and storage, and energy efficiency In this analysis, for purposes of quantifying highly uncertain 'demand-side', or 'energy efficiency-increasing' investments, we inherit the methodology of McCollum et al.
