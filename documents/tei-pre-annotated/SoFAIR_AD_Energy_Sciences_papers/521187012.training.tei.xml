        <p>Climate change presents the greatest challenge facing all countries of the world in the new millennium. Among others, objective 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims at adopting urgent measures to contrast climate change and its consequences. Part of the decline in the global growth of emissions has been the increase in using renewable energies. In this context, the relationship among GDP, CO 2 emissions, and renewable energy use has been investigated in this study, starting from a systematic review that has noticed the presence of three clusters focused on: CO2 emissions, GDP, and energy consumption. Despite the current level of interest in examining the relationship among these variables, there have been few empirical studies. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper has been focused on the Scandinavian countries, where the use of renewable energies has steadily increased, developing novel panel analysis estimates. Using a dataset of these five economies over a 1990-2018 time period, several panel data tests have been carried out, in order to robustly assess the causality issue among renewable energies, CO 2 emissions, and GDP. The results of the empirical analysis imply that renewable energy consumption is a useful policy instrument to reduce CO 2 emissions without adversely affecting GDP growth. The main implications have been that the decrease of CO 2 emissions, by increasing renewable energy use, can guarantee high levels of energy efficiency and economic growth. These empirical findings help design innovative energy policy roadmaps and accelerate the ecological transition through the promotion of renewable energy and the reduction of GHG emissions.Climate change presents the greatest challenge facing all countries of the world in the new millennium.

        <p>In 2015, the United Nations issued 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030 (UN, 2017) in order to establish a new and concrete agenda for sustainable development. The 17 Goals refer to a set of important development issues that take into account in a balanced way the three dimensions of sustainable developmenteconomic, social, and ecological. Among them, Objective 13 is aimed at Adopting urgent measures to contrast Climate Change and its consequences (UN, 2017). Climate change presents the greatest challenge facing all countries of the world in the new millennium. The need for reducing global CO 2 production represents a global environmental threat that requires a global response to create a real solution, otherwise, the continuous rising trend in CO 2 emissions will become even more problematic (IPCC, 2018).In 2015, the United Nations issued 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030 (UN, 2017) in order to establish a new and concrete agenda for sustainable development.

        <p>The steady increase in the global average temperature is making environments increasingly costly and physically difficult to live in, creating a great risk to public health across all countries, developed or developing, and rich or poor (Watts et al., 2021;Gravili et al., 2020).The steady increase in the global average temperature is making environments increasingly costly and physically difficult to live in, creating a great risk to public health across all countries, developed or developing, and rich or poor (Watts et al., 2021;Gravili et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The sources of excessive carbon emissions are widespread, with the World Health Organization finding that exacerbating outdoor air pollution has caused approximately 4.2 million premature deaths yearly (Shaddick et al., 2020). Moreover, global warming intensifies the negative impact of seawater acidification, thus leading to coral bleaching and irreparable destruction of marine life (Hue et al., 2022).The sources of excessive carbon emissions are widespread, with the World Health Organization finding that exacerbating outdoor air pollution has caused approximately 4.2 million premature deaths yearly (Shaddick et al., 2020).

        <p>The ambitious goals to contrast climate change, as set by the Paris Agreement, are unlikely to be achieved if the current speed of action in intervention operations continues to be maintained (United Nations Environment Programme, 2020) as highlighted also during the Glasgow COP26 Conference. The reduction in the number of emissions in the decade 2020-2030 has been estimated at least 7.6% per year (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019). To this end, the European Green Deal has set the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% by 2030 to allow us to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 (European Commission, 2020), which however appears to be increasingly a chimera.The ambitious goals to contrast climate change, as set by the Paris Agreement, are unlikely to be achieved if the current speed of action in intervention operations continues to be maintained (United Nations Environment Programme, 2020) as highlighted also during the Glasgow COP26 Conference.

        <p>Over the years, the economic growth has had a negative impact on the quality of life of humans and especially on the environment and on the flux of Ecosystem Service (ES); for instance, in addition to the growth of GHG emissions, we have seen soil, air and water pollution, overexploitation of the soil, disorderly and excessive growth of cities, depletion of natural resources, etc., with enormous problems for global society (Charfeddine and Mrabet, 2017;Canaj et al., 2021).Over the years, the economic growth has had a negative impact on the quality of life of humans and especially on the environment and on the flux of Ecosystem Service (ES); for instance, in addition to the growth of GHG emissions, we have seen soil, air and water pollution, overexploitation of the soil, disorderly and excessive growth of cities, depletion of natural resources, etc., with enormous problems for global society (Charfeddine and Mrabet, 2017;Canaj et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Ecosystem services are fundamental to human well-being and maintaining the sustainability of such SEs and improving people's livelihoods are critical to global sustainable development. Global climate change has caused significant changes in ES supply (Atkinson et al., 2016;King et al., 2014). ES can represent the true links between nature and society, since they place the foundations of ES (i.e., ecosystem properties) as the basis for the realization of human wellbeing (Yu et al., 2017).Ecosystem services are fundamental to human well-being and maintaining the sustainability of such SEs and improving people's livelihoods are critical to global sustainable development.

        <p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) has announced that, after two years of growth, global CO 2 emissions from energy sources in 2019 have stabilized at about 33 billion tons, roughly the same as in 2018 (IEA, 2020). However, a one-year freeze in CO 2 emissions does not indicate a world peak in emissions has been reached, as global GDP fell during the shutdowns facing many economies during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is a sign that the world's economies can have confidence in the possibilities arising from mitigating global warming to prevent future catastrophic levels of economic output and human wellbeing (Beard et al., 2021).The International Energy Agency (IEA) has announced that, after two years of growth, global CO 2 emissions from energy sources in 2019 have stabilized at about 33 billion tons, roughly the same as in 2018 (IEA, 2020).

        <p>Part of the decline in the global growth of emissions has been the increase in using green fuel sources for electricity generation. For example, the IEA has found that a decline in the worldwide use of coal to produce electricity in 2019 has reduced global emissions of CO 2 by nearly 200 Mt, as compared to 2018. The most advanced economies (USA, Europe, and Japan) enjoyed an average GDP growth rate of 1.7% despite having reduced their emissions by over 370 Mt of CO 2 . This reflects a 3.2% reduction in the electricity generation sector among the most advanced economies, bringing emissions to their lowest level since 1980, back when the electricity consumed was a third lower than in 2019 (IEA, 2020).Part of the decline in the global growth of emissions has been the increase in using green fuel sources for electricity generation.

        <p>The energy transition in Europe passes through the countries of the North. Photovoltaic, wind, biomass, geothermal: these are the rapidly growing renewable sources in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, and Norway, which suggest that the energy mix in these countries is increasingly greener. Sweden has reached and surpassed its first GW of photovoltaics, in Finland, the consumption of renewable energy exceeds that of fossil fuels, Denmark has committed to supply 100% renewable energy by 2050, and so on. Therefore, when it comes to energy transition in Europe, the countries of the North are the reference. This is also supported by the recent World Economic Forum report "Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2021". In the ranking, which considers 115 countries, the top three are respectively Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. But Finland (sixth) and Iceland (tenth) also appear in the top ten. Denmark and Finland, in addition to the United Kingdom, are the countries that have shown the most significant improvements in the top 10: they have been able to improve the performance of their energy system and sustainability results thanks to a stable regulatory environment, and energy mix and prices, which reflect the costs.The energy transition in Europe passes through the countries of the North.

        <p>Nevertheless, different economic growth ambitions across the nations, as well as persistent international imbalances between the levels of economic development across the nations, make the geopolitical challenge of finding an international solution to this global problem exceptionally difficult. Indeed, the vast scientific literature on the relationship between CO 2 emissions and GDP growth, as well as what levels of cooperative actions would be necessary to adequately address the issue, has been growing steadily over the last decade.Nevertheless, different economic growth ambitions across the nations, as well as persistent international imbalances between the levels of economic development across the nations, make the geopolitical challenge of finding an international solution to this global problem exceptionally difficult.

        <p>Our paper focuses on identifying the relationship between GDP growth and CO 2 emissions over a sufficiently long period of time. This empirical analysis uses an appropriate econometric approach that focuses on data from some states of northern Europe. One of the shortcomings of the literature on this issue is the lack of data from homogeneous clusters of countries. This study investigates the dynamics relating to the relationship between GDP and CO 2 emissions using data collected from a group of states with common geographical proximity and similar economic development. Furthermore, these countries have formally committed to reducing emissions long ago. This allows us to perform a more robust, dynamic analysis in terms of economic impact, and capacity for predicting what may happen in other countries currently at the beginning of this path.Our paper focuses on identifying the relationship between GDP growth and CO 2 emissions over a sufficiently long period of time.

        <p>In this context, the present research has made a significant contribution in terms of highlighting how the modification of the structure of energy consumption is a key measure that contributes to sustainable economic growth. The contributions of this study are the simultaneous analysis of economic growth, CO 2 emissions, and the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption in a single framework. Second, the pool of countries included in our analysis is also unique in that no previous study has studied these countries using econometrics in countries defined as global models for the use of renewable energy and which are comparable from one point of view. economic development. This is an important factor because in general, in countries that are at an early stage of development, economic growth creates a reckless exploitation of environmental resources without suffering the damage of the consequent environmental degradation.In this context, the present research has made a significant contribution in terms of highlighting how the modification of the structure of energy consumption is a key measure that contributes to sustainable economic growth.

        <p>The aim of the following analysis is to fill the existing gap in the literature as it relates to the effectiveness of renewable energy in containing a nation's CO 2 emissions without damping economic growth. We intend to evaluate this relationship robustly using data from advanced economies which are closer to the existing global technological frontier.The aim of the following analysis is to fill the existing gap in the literature as it relates to the effectiveness of renewable energy in containing a nation's CO 2 emissions without damping economic growth.

        <p>Global warming and climate change represent the world's most important issues in the environment-economy nexus. GHG in general, and CO 2 emissions in particular, are the main factors responsible for global warming and climate change (Sari and Soytas, 2009;Esso and Keho, 2016;Magazzino and Falcone, 2022). In this context, many scholars and policymakers have turned their attention to the relationship between climate change, energy production, and sustainable economic growth. Many economists believe that inefficient environmental regulations and policies can limit an economy's production possibilities and hurt long-term economic growth (Ricci, 2007).Global warming and climate change represent the world's most important issues in the environment-economy nexus.

        <p>These relationships have been analyzed through different analytical approaches. One strand of research in the economics literature investigates the nexus between economic development and environmental pollution. These studies try to verify the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, which postulates an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between different pollutants and per capita income in the economy. That is, environmental degradation in an economy initially increases with a nation's prosperity, but at some point, it eventually decreases as prosperity continues to rise further. Therefore, the EKC hypothesis expresses a specific relationship between growth and environmental quality (Dinda, 2004;Arouri et al., 2012;Pérez-Suárez and López-Menéndez, 2015;Rüstemoglu and Andrés, 2016). Other research has focused specifically on the relationship between a nation's energy consumption and its economic growth. The first effort in this direction was the study conducted by Kraft and Kraft (1978), from which the literature on causality emerged (Belloumi, 2009;Bélaïd and Abderrahmani, 2013;Omri, 2013). Other approaches investigated the relationship between energy consumption, economic growth, and pollution emissions (Ang, 2007;Arouri et al., 2012;Kasman and Duman, 2015;Magazzino et al., 2021aMagazzino et al., , 2021b;;Mele et al., 2021a). The results of these studies vary depending on the country analyzed, which reflects several factors that differed across these empirical studies. This included institutional differences between countries, variations in model specifications, and econometric techniques used to examine the data.These relationships have been analyzed through different analytical approaches.

        <p>In contrast to the popular analytical procedures previously described, the most recent empirical studies explore the relationship between economic growth and renewable energy consumption (Apergis and Payne, 2010a;b;2011a;b;2012a;b;Sadorsky, 2009;2012;Tugcu et al., 2012;Magazzino, 2017;Apergis et al., 2018;Brady and Magazzino, 2018). Some researchers have focused on how renewable energy is enhancing economic growth while contrasting global warming. The new trend in the economic literature investigates the effects of both renewable and non-renewable energy consumption on the economy, but there are a few studies that have focused on the causal relationship between environmental degradation, renewable and/or non-renewable energy, and economic growth (Bélaïd &amp; Ben Youssef, 2017). Chopra et al. (2022) highlighted that CO 2 emissions reduce agricultural productivity in the ASEAN countries. Magazzino et al. (2020) suggested a careful analysis of the process that will lead to the abandonment of nuclear energy in Switzerland to avoid adverse effects on economic growth.

        <p>Thanks to the rapid deployment of renewable energy across multiple countries, a growing number of studies have investigated how the role of renewable energy consumption has affected both environmental quality and economic development at the country, regional, and global levels. For example, Menyah and Wolde-Rufael (2010) used the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) test to explore the causal relationship between CO 2 emissions, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and economic growth in the USA over the period 1960-2007. Their investigation confirms a unidirectional causality from nuclear energy production to lower carbon emissions, finding evidence supporting the theory that non-renewable energy production has had a negative impact on both the environment and the economy. A second important result is a unidirectional causality from CO 2 emissions to renewable energy consumption.Thanks to the rapid deployment of renewable energy across multiple countries, a growing number of studies have investigated how the role of renewable energy consumption has affected both environmental quality and economic development at the country, regional, and global levels.

        <p>A case study by Shafiei and Salim (2014) explored the relationship between non-renewable and renewable energy consumption and CO2 emissions among OECD countries using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology model (STIRPAT model) over the period 1980-2011. Their results support the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve between CO 2 emissions and urbanization, supporting the theory that renewable energy consumption decreases CO 2 emissions, whereas non-renewable energy consumption increases CO 2 emissions. These results imply that policymakers should design and develop effective support policies to promote investment in new renewable energy technologies.A case study by Shafiei and Salim (2014) explored the relationship between non-renewable and renewable energy consumption and CO2 emissions among OECD countries using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology model (STIRPAT model) over the period 1980-2011.

        <p>Jebly and Youssef (2015) investigate the link between GDP, combustible renewables and waste consumption (CWR), and CO 2 emissions across five North African countries during the period 1971-2008. Their findings suggest both short-and long-run unidirectional causalities spanning from CO 2 emissions and CRW consumption to real GDP and a short-run unidirectional causality where CRW decreases CO 2 emissions. Bekhet and Othman (2018) tried to estimate the gap between economic activity and environmental quality in Malaysia. They use the cubic polynomial functional form of EKC by placing renewable energy at the base of the EKC model and find supporting evidence for the relationship between CO 2 emissions and GDP growth for the 1971-2015 period. Their findings show that renewable energy has a negative impact on CO 2 emissions in the long-run perspective.Jebly and Youssef (2015) investigate the link between GDP, combustible renewables and waste consumption (CWR), and CO 2 emissions across five North African countries during the period 1971-2008.

The results show that, in the long-run, environmental innovations tend to lower CO 2 emissions.Finally, Mongo et al.

        <p>The results have shown three clusters with the following central nodes: CO 2 emissions, GDP, and energy consumption. The most frequent keyword has been "CO 2 emissions" (red cluster), which has been, together with "renewable energy", one of the central topics of the systematic review. "CO 2 emissions" keyword has shown a great weight, evident from the size of the node, and the greatest number of elements (keywords) associated with it. Another important keyword has been "GDP" (blue cluster), a transversal topic associated with several research topics, such as financial development, urbanization, and climate change (Fig. 1). Finally, "energy consumption" has been the last cluster, less important than "CO2 emissions" and "renewable energy", as evident from the size of the node. In particular, "energy consumption" (green cluster) has resulted more linked with "sustainable development", "globalization", and "tourism" (Fig. 2).The results have shown three clusters with the following central nodes: CO 2 emissions, GDP, and energy consumption.

        <p>Despite the current level of interest in examining the relationship among renewable energy, carbon emissions, and economic growth, there have been few empirical studies. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper has been focused on the Scandinavian countries, where the use of renewable energies has steadily increased, developing novel panel analysis estimates.Despite the current level of interest in examining the relationship among renewable energy, carbon emissions, and economic growth, there have been few empirical studies.

        <p>The empirical estimation and the methodology applied in this paper are well established in the international literature (Bélaïd and Zrelli, 2019;Aydogan and Vardar, 2020;Zhang and Zhang, 2021). The variables used in the analysis have included the Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP), renewable energy (RE), and CO 2 emissions (CO2Em). In particular, in this research, RGDP has been used to indicate economic growth and is expressed in constant LCU (Local Currency Unit). CO 2 Em is measured in metric tons per capita and it has been used as a proxy for environmental pollution as an indicator of the level of GHG emissions. Finally, RE is the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption. All variables used in the analysis have been transformed into a logarithmic scale in order to make them comparable.The empirical estimation and the methodology applied in this paper are well established in the international literature (Bélaïd and Zrelli, 2019;Aydogan and Vardar, 2020;Zhang and Zhang, 2021).

Generally speaking, the results in Table 5 have shown that we have failed to reject the non-stationarity hypothesis, with both deterministic specifications (with both a constant and a constant with a trend). Thus, we could assume that all variables in the dataset share cross-section dependence and are non-stationary.On the basis of this cross-section dependence, the analysis has gone ahead with running the so-called second generation panel unit root tests (or panel unit root tests in presence of cross-section dependence), where the presence of cross-section dependence among the residuals is allowed within the panel.

        <p>The next step concerns the cointegration analysis. With this type of analysis, it is possible to establish a linear stationary relationship between non-stationary stochastic processes, in order to identify a stable relationship over time between variables that, taken individually, are not stable. The results of Kao's residual cointegration test and Pedroni's test for cointegration are shown in Table 6. Strong evidence has been found to reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration at the 1% level of significance in both the Pedroni and the Kao tests results. Therefore, it has been possible to conclude that a long-run cointegration relationship has emerged among the variables for the multi-country panel. These results have been consistent with both Lee (2005) and Sadorsky (2009) empirical findings. Therefore, assuming that renewable energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and RGDP are all cointegrated, the long-run coefficients have been estimated by applying the FMOLS estimator (Pedroni, 2001). In general, the results have indicated a long-run negative co-movement for all relationships examined. Analyzing each country individually has revealed statistically significant coefficients at the 1% level for Denmark across the three estimated models. This means, for example, that a 1% increase in Denmark's real GDP leads to a 0.69% decrease in renewable energy consumption. Regarding the relationship between renewable energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, the magnitude of the estimated coefficient has varied from 0.9872 for Sweden to 0.2795 for Iceland. However, the coefficient has not been statistically significant for Finland and Norway. Table 6 shows a negative coefficient of renewable energy consumption on CO 2 emissions, indicating that increasing renewable energy consumption leads to falling CO 2 emissions.The next step concerns the cointegration analysis.

        <p>The results in Table 7 indicate that the Scandinavian countries are converging towards a more sustainable economy that is focused on renewable energy with far less GHG production. The abundance of renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar, hydropower, photovoltaic waste, biomass, and geothermal) in most of these countries has likely stimulated the efficient development of renewable energy technologies as well as the investment in this type of energy. This positively affected their economic growth as well as reduced their GHG emissions (Fuinhas et al., 2017;Dinda, 2004;Brock and Taylor, 2005;Nowotny et al., 2018;Kahia et al., 2019;Magazzino et al., 2021d;Usman et al., 2021).The results in Table 7 indicate that the Scandinavian countries are converging towards a more sustainable economy that is focused on renewable energy with far less GHG production.

        <p>The question is: can the European nations generally be considered the front runners in achieving a sustainable environment with legible developmental milestones? This paper has presented a tentative to address this intriguing question by considering the methodologies deployed by developed economies (Usman et al., 2021), but by applying a different panel estimation to a very homogeneous group of European countries that represent the first to invest in reducing emissions. The analysis of the positive effects of investing in renewable energies on the reduction of COs emissions, and increasing real GDP can help guide the transition of other countries.The question is: can the European nations generally be considered the front runners in achieving a sustainable environment with legible developmental milestones?

        <p>Thus, the findings of this study show that for three of the five countries in the sample, renewable energy consumption negatively affects the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. Similarly, Khan et al. (2021a) and Bilgili et al. (2016) found that renewable energy consumption has a negative and significant impact on the proportion of CO emissions. Also, Shafiei and Salim (2014) and Bélaïd and Zrelli (2019) provided similar results for OECD countries and Mediterranean Countries, demonstrating a negative relationship between renewable energy and the increase in CO 2 emissions.Thus, the findings of this study show that for three of the five countries in the sample, renewable energy consumption negatively affects the amount of carbon dioxide emissions.

        <p>These findings may indicate that the consumption of renewable energy could significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions for any nation. This means an increase in the consumption of renewable energy can be expected to reduce a nation's dependence on fossil energy consumption, and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Support for such an argument was found in Thailand by Kusumadewi et al. (2017). Similarly, Salim and Rafiq (2012) find that the use of renewable energy tends to reduce the problem of environmental pollution in Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia.These findings may indicate that the consumption of renewable energy could significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions for any nation.

        <p>The interaction between renewables and GDP per capita may mean that affluent nations with high levels of fossil fuels and renewables tend to squeeze out nuclear power, which is an electricity source that is not captured by either category (renewables or fossil fuels). In this case, high levels of renewables make economic growth dependent on fossil fuels in place of nuclear power, and conversely, in affluent nations with nuclear power, growth in renewables tends to substitute more for nuclear power than for fossil fuels (York and McGee, 2017). A similar result has been found by Sovacool et al. (2020), whose analysis used a multiple regressions specification on global datasets of national carbon emissions and renewable and nuclear electricity production across 123 countries over a period of 25 years. The empirical results revealed that large use of nuclear energy could not be associated with a direct reduction of CO emissions, where a nation's attachment to nuclear and renewable fuel sources tends to crowd each other out. From a short-term perspective, policymakers can create several measures, such as tax incentives and subsidies for low GHG-emitting energy sources (Galinato and Yoder, 2010), sectoral subsidies to increase the production/usage of biomass energy fuels (Bilgili, 2012), a system of fair and affordable access to the electricity from renewable sources (Reiche and Bechberger, 2004), feed-in tariffs (Kalkuhl et al., 2013), and green certificate trading. In the long-term, policymakers can subsidize renewable energy technologies, promote private investment grant policies, and create investment subsidies (Bilgili et al., 2016). Ultimately, countries must make use of properly defined rules and policies that promote lower GHG emission concentrations and sustainable economic development, such as proper carbon pricing, and GHG emissions taxation, and motivate the development of technologies that require less carbon utilization.The interaction between renewables and GDP per capita may mean that affluent nations with high levels of fossil fuels and renewables tend to squeeze out nuclear power, which is an electricity source that is not captured by either category (renewables or fossil fuels).

        <p>Ultimately, three policy implications emerge from the results. First, there is now no doubt that renewable energies improve environmental well-being. Secondly, the Nordic countries have high energy efficiencies. Technological innovation plays an effective role in the link between energy and growth, and in addition, it represents a significant indicator to reveal the connection between economic growth and the use of renewable energies. Finally, the Scandinavian countries can be one of the most virtuous examples of the use of renewable energy with a view to reducing CO 2 emissions and therefore environmental sustainability, however, greater political, financial, and scientific research support is needed to activate processes of low-carbon energy transitions in various fields.Ultimately, three policy implications emerge from the results. First, there is now no doubt that renewable energies improve environmental well-being. Secondly, the Nordic countries have high energy efficiencies.

        <p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an action program for people, the planet, and prosperity that takes into account the need to support universal peace and freedom, to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions. However, there is a need to propose an economic system based on well-being (Fioramonti et al., 2022) that would make a great contribution to human and ecological well-being, by including costs and benefits linked not only to the market but to society as a whole in the system.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an action program for people, the planet, and prosperity that takes into account the need to support universal peace and freedom, to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions.

        <p>The interconnection between carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, and GHG is perhaps the most researched term in environmental economics. A nation's efforts to reduce GHG emissions with a minimal negative impact on economic development is a major milestone in attaining future sustainable economic growth (Khan et al., 2021b). Economists usually refer to relative decoupling as the condition when a nation's increases in carbon emissions fall behind increases in economic development. Achieving this goal requires an empirical analysis of emissions, which is also commonly referred to as the GDP relationship. This connection is of vital importance for the developing (and developed) regions of the global economy, as those regions are considered the major contributors to the increased global warming (Song et al., 2019).The interconnection between carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, and GHG is perhaps the most researched term in environmental economics.

        <p>Investing in renewable energies can represent an economic insurance for the future, since it could be one strategy to reduce risks and uncertainties towards climate change (Valente et al., 2019). Ecological insurance, the assessment of economic and ecological vulnerability and/ or resilience, and the adaptive management of socio-ecological systems can represent key and interacting elements able to mitigate the risk of damages due to meteorological disasters.Investing in renewable energies can represent an economic insurance for the future, since it could be one strategy to reduce risks and uncertainties towards climate change (Valente et al., 2019).

        <p>The results of this study are timely and significant in shaping global climate policy because they are ambitious CO 2 reduction targets, such as controlling global warming to 2 • C, as in the agreement entered into in the 2015 Paris Agreement (COP 21) which requires understanding primarily the links between energy consumption, economic growth, use of renewable resources and CO 2 emissions. This, in turn, makes it possible to define effective CO 2 mitigation and reduction policies in the fight against the harmful impacts of climate change and thus contributing to global sustainability.The results of this study are timely and significant in shaping global climate policy because they are ambitious CO 2 reduction targets, such as controlling global warming to 2 • C, as in the agreement entered into in the 2015 Paris Agreement (COP 21) which requires understanding primarily the links between energy consumption, economic growth, use of renewable resources and CO 2 emissions.

        <p>The income elasticity of carbon dioxide emissions, as a measure of the response of GHG emissions to growth in the economy, is another way to examine the issue of decoupling. However, the Granger causality test indicated no evidence that shows the existence of a positive causal relationship running from renewable energy consumption to economic growth that was expected. This may be due to Scandinavian Countries having relatively low levels of both energy intensity and CO 2 emissions (Irandoust, 2016;2018;Ducoing, 2021). Future research might explore this topic for Scandinavian countries with a different approach, for example by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques (Magazzino et al., 2020(Magazzino et al., , 2021c(Magazzino et al., , 2021e, 2022;;Mele et al., 2021b) and the contribution of renewable energies in terms of human well-being. Moreover, another possibility for future works may involve a proper structural approach, entailing the estimation of these relationships jointly, also disentangling direct and indirect effects, through the estimation of a Structural Equation Model (SEM).The income elasticity of carbon dioxide emissions, as a measure of the response of GHG emissions to growth in the economy, is another way to examine the issue of decoupling.
