        <p>Molten salts have been widely used as energy storage materials in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage. However, pure salt commonly suffers from low thermal conductivity and many conventional methods of heat transfer enhancement do not apply due to the serious corrosion and the extremely high temperature. In the current study, the open-cell SiC ceramic foam was integrated with solar salt (60wt% NaNO 3 + 40wt% KNO 3 ) to enhance the heat transfer of salt and avoid severe corrosion issues. A visualised experiment was for the first time conducted to investigate the melting phase change heat transfer in the ceramic foam/molten salt composite phase change material (CPCM). A representative elementary volume (REV)-scale simulation was simultaneously performed and the computational results were compared with experimental data. It is found that the conduction-friendly ceramic skeleton remarkably enhances the heat transfer in molten salt, especially in the region far away from the heat source. The spatial temperature difference across the composite is decreased in both horizontal and vertical directions and the local superheating is mitigated. The enhancement of heat conduction is greater than the suppression of natural convection; as a result, the melting rate of the CPCM is increased by 41.3%. This study provides crucial benchmark data of phase change heat transfer for medium-temperature thermal energy storage and paves the way for system design and optimization.Molten salts have been widely used as energy storage materials in medium-and high-temperature thermal energy storage.

        <p>Using renewable energy is one of the most effective methods to cope with the worldwide energy crisis and environmental pollution [1][2][3] . Some energy resources, such as solar energy, have the drawbacks of intermittence and instability, which hampers their efficiency seriously [4] . To address this problem, latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) was proposed [5][6][7] . This technology stores thermal energy in phase change materials (PCMs) and releases it when the energy is needed [ 8 , 9 ]. According to the melting point of PCMs, thermal energy storage is classified as lowtemperature (melting point &lt; 100 °C), medium-temperature (melting point 10 0-30 0 °C) and high-temperature (melting point &gt; 300 °C) ones [10] . Molten salts have been widely used as medium-and high-temperature energy storage materials due to their appropriate melting point, large energy storage density, low cost, excellent thermal stability, etc. [11][12][13][14] . In integrated organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems where solar heat is converted into power, heat transfer fluid (HTF) absorbs heat in the solar collector and flows to the molten salt tank where heat is stored. The storage tank supplies stable heat to the ORC sub-system, maintaining ORC operating under design conditions and overcoming the instability of solar radiation. Moreover, the molten salt storage tank supplies heat for the evening power generation to meet the evening peak electricity demand, which overcomes the intermittency of solar radiation [15] .Using renewable energy is one of the most effective methods to cope with the worldwide energy crisis and environmental pollution [1][2][3] .

        <p>However, almost all pure PCMs except metals suffer from low thermal conductivity [13] . For molten salt, the low thermal conductivity means a slow charging/discharging rate, which impairs the efficiency of solar power plants and decreases the output power. Many methods have been proposed to enhance the heat transfer of pure PCMs. For low-temperature PCMs such as paraf- fin, the metal foam and fins have been extensively studied and proved to be good thermal promoters [4] . But for molten salt, these heat transfer enhancement technologies may not apply because the metal foam and fin can be corroded by molten salt [16] , and they can soften in the extremely high-temperature environment. In addition, the cost of metal is high, which also impedes its application in molten salt.However, almost all pure PCMs except metals suffer from low thermal conductivity [13] .

        <p>Ceramics have inherently high thermal conductivity and excellent corrosion-resistant performance [17][18][19] . Some researchers have studied using ceramics to enhance the heat transfer of molten salts. Liu et al. [20] prepared a ceramic-based composite phase change material (CPCM) where mullite-corundum act as the porous skeleton and Na 2 SO 4 as PCM. Jiang et al. [21] designed three Na 2 SO 4 -NaCl/ceramic CPCMs. They found that the addition of α-alumina and mullite mitigated the supercooling of the eutectic Na 2 SO 4 -NaCl. Furthermore, these composites had good thermal stability under 20 thermal cycles. Wang et al. [22] fabricated a ternary salt/Si 3 N 4 CPCM using the pressure impregnation method. Their results indicated that the thermal conductivity of the composite was more than six times higher than that of pure ternary salt. Xu et al. [23] utilised the diatomite to load NaNO 3 . However, the composite was found to have a low thermal conductivity of ∼0.5 W/m K. Authors added 10 wt% graphite and the thermal conductivity was improved by six-folds. Jiang et al. [24] developed a modified diatomite-based CPCM. CaCO 3 powders were added into diatomite and the mixture was sintered at 1150 °C to obtain the porous skeleton. The prepared CPCM exhibited excellent cycling stability during 500 thermal cycles. It is noted that the above mentioned ceramic-based composites are shape-stabilised PCMs; in other words, the pore size is very small, in the magnitude of micron and nanometre, so the fluid is restricted by capillary force and surface tension and the leakage is prevented. In terms of open-cell ceramic skeleton, Liu et al. [25] used the foaming method to prepare a large-pore ceramic-based CPCM where the maximum pore size was in the magnitude of a millimetre. The open-cell configuration enables natural convection and benefits the heat transfer enhancement. The thermal conductivity of prepared CPCM is reported to be 31.8-52.6 W/m K. Luo et al. [26] fabricated nanoparticle-molten salt-ceramic CPCM with synergetic enhanced specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity and optical absorption. The specific heat capacity and thermal conductivity of CPCM are 4.9% and 159% higher than that of pure salt respectively. However, most of the studies on molten salt/ceramic CPCM paid more attention to material preparation and characterisation, while the phase change heat transfer characteristics, such as solid-liquid phase interface, melting rate and heat conduction/natural convection, are rarely investigated.Ceramics have inherently high thermal conductivity and excellent corrosion-resistant performance [17][18][19] .

        <p>Phase change heat transfer is of fundamental importance for determining thermal-fluidic behaviours of PCMs and optimising the performance of thermal energy storage (TES) systems [4] . Some researchers have studied the phase change heat transfer characteristics of porous CPCMs. Li et al. [27] experimentally and numerically studied the melting phase change heat transfer of paraffin saturated in open-cell metal foams. The effect of foam morphology including porosity and pore size on the wall temperature and temperature uniformity was investigated. Zheng et al. [28] studied the effect of heating position on the phase change heat transfer of paraffin/copper foam CPCM. They found that PCM heated at the top melted slowest and the temperature difference was the largest. Yao et al. [29] carried out a pore-scale study on the melting heat transfer of paraffin/copper foam. The solid-liquid interface and temperature field were captured to visualise the detailed melting phenomenon. Yang et al. [30] numerically investigated the melting phase change of open-cell foam embedded paraffin. Their results indicate that natural convection exerts a significant influence on the melting front shape, temperature distribution and melting rate.Phase change heat transfer is of fundamental importance for determining thermal-fluidic behaviours of PCMs and optimising the performance of thermal energy storage (TES) systems [4] .

Combined with the simulated flow fields in Fig. 6 , it can be inferred that PCM near the heating wall is melted first, afterwards, the liquid hot PCM is driven by the buoyancy force and flows upwards along the heating wall; the hot PCM accumulates at the top region and accelerates the melting of this region, while at the bottom region, the melting is slow; as a result, a sloped phase interface is formed. With the time elapsed, more PCM is melted and the effect of nat- ural convection is strengthened, so the solid-liquid interface becomes more curved.Fig. 5 shows the experimental and simulated solid-liquid phase interface (the plane of y = 25 mm).

        <p>By comparing the experimental and numerical results, it is found that the simulated melting is faster than the experimental result. The possible reasons are as follows: (1) due to the surface roughness, the aluminium heater and the quartz cavity cannot be fit completely, which causes the contact thermal resistance and de-creases the heating efficiency; while in the simulation, the left side of the quartz cavity is constantly 300 °C; (2) the aluminium silicate fiberboards with the thickness of 5.0 cm were used to wrap the quartz cavity in the experiment, however, there may be still a little heat loss to the environment; (3) during the experiment, the front cover was removed every 10 min to take pictures, which also leads to heat loss; (4) the temperature controller is set as 300 °C, however, it takes some time for the aluminium heater to reach 300 °C, while in the simulation, the left side of the quartz cavity is 300 °C initially. Thus, it is expected that the simulated melting is faster than the experimental measurements. Nevertheless, the shape and the evolution trend of the simulated phase interface is consistent with experimental results.

        <p>Compared to conventional paraffin/metal foam CPCM [44] , the solid-liquid phase interface of molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM is much curved. The reason may lie in the low viscosity of molten salt: the viscosity of liquid molten salt is 4.6 mPa •s, while that of paraffin is 32.6 mPa •s [44] . As a result, the natural convection in molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM is stronger and solid-liquid interface is more curved.Compared to conventional paraffin/metal foam CPCM [44] , the solid-liquid phase interface of molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM is much curved.

        <p>The simulated solid-liquid phase interface at the plane of x = 10 mm is presented in Fig. 6 . Due to the high thermal diffusivity of the quartz, the melting rate of the edge region is faster than that of the middle region. The velocity magnitude of the CPCM is obviously smaller than that of the pure PCM, where the maximum velocity of the liquid PCM in the former is about 9 × 10 -4 m/s while that in the latter can reach up to 2.2 × 10 -3 m/s. This is because, in the pure PCM, the liquid PCM flows freely while in the CPCM, the fluid flow is restricted by the inertial and viscous resistance induced by the porous skeleton [45] . The low velocity of the liquid PCM means that the natural convection is weakened. As seen in Fig. 5 , the bottom region of the liquid salt in CPCM is wider than that in pure PCM, which confirms natural convection is weaker in CPCM. Nevertheless, the seriously sloped interface of the CPCM suggests that natural convection still plays a non-negligible role in heat transfer. It may be attributed to the open cells and large pores of the ceramic foam. The addition of the ceramic foam obviously accelerates the melting. The complete melting time of CPCM is 7200 s while that of pure PCM is 12600s.

        <p>Considering the porosity (0.85) and the impregnation ratio ( &gt; 95%), the melting rate of CPCM is 41.3% higher than that of pure PCM. Moreover, it is seen from the simulated phase fields that the mushy region of CPCM is wider than that of pure PCM, indicating that the spatially synchronous phase change is boosted. The mushy region is the region where the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature (246.0 °C) to the solidus temperature (222.9 °C). The thermal resistance of pure PCM is high, so the temperature quickly decreases from the liquidus temperature to the solidus temperature, leading to a narrow mushy region. In contrast, the effective thermal conductivity of CPCM is higher and the thermal resistance is lower, so the high temperature can extend to the further area, resulting in a wider mushy region.Considering the porosity (0.85) and the impregnation ratio ( &gt; 95%), the melting rate of CPCM is 41.3% higher than that of pure PCM.

        <p>The transient temperature distributions on the front surface of the cavity with CPCM or pure PCM is presented in Fig. 7 . It is seen that both the experimental and simulated temperature fields are consistent with the solid-liquid phase interface. And the reasons for the deviation between the experimental and numerical results have been analysed in the Section 4.1 . It is found from Fig. 7 that the thermal stratification of pure PCM is very obvious; moreover, the high-temperature region is concentrated in the upper left corner, resulting in the local superheating. In contrast, the temperature distribution of the CPCM is more uniform; the spatial temperature difference is decreased in both horizontal and vertical directions. The thermal conductivity of pure solar salt (solid) is 0.59 W/m K; the effective thermal conductivity of CPCM is 1.60 W/m K. The addition of ceramic foam effectively enhances the transfer heat of salt, so the temperature of salt, especially the part far away from the heating wall increases faster. Moreover, since the thermal energy of the heat source can be efficiently transferred to the internal salt, the local superheating is mitigated.The transient temperature distributions on the front surface of the cavity with CPCM or pure PCM is presented in Fig. 7 .

It is noted that the improvement in temperature is more obvious for points P2 and P3. It may be attributed to the fact that P2 and P3 are more distant from the heating wall, so the enhancement effect of the ceramic skeleton can be exhibited more fully.The temperature of points P1, P2 and P3 measured by thermocouples is plotted in Fig. 8 .

        <p>The temperature difference between P1 and P2/P3 is plotted in Fig. 9 . The temperature difference curves have the characteristics of "rising first, then falling and finally stabilizing". This is because the temperature of P1 increases faster than the other two points, so the temperature difference becomes larger at the initial stage; when the temperature of P1 gradually approaches the maximum value, that of P2 and P3 still increases rapidly, thus the temperature difference gets smaller; when the PCM which covers P1, P2 and P3 is completely melted, heat can be transferred effectively from P1 to P2/P3 under the effect of heat conduction plus natural convection, so the temperature difference becomes stable.The temperature difference between P1 and P2/P3 is plotted in Fig. 9 .

        <p>It is noted that the addition of the ceramic foam decreases the temperature difference significantly. Taking the temperature difference between P1 and P2 as an example, the maximum value in the pure PCM is 125.7 °C while that in the composite PCM is 98.8 °C, the decrease is about 27 °C. The temperature uniformity is very important because the uniform temperature distribution can mitigate the thermal stress on the equipment. The addition of the ceramic foam not only improves the energy storage efficiency but also benefits extending the lifespan of equipment. Fig. 10 shows the temperature fields of PCM and ceramic foam in CPCM ( T ceramic -T PCM ). It is seen that an obviously high temperature-difference region forms in the bottom left corner. This is due to the fact that the hot liquid PCM in the bottom left corner has been pushed to the top region and the cold PCM flows to this region; the temperature of PCM is low, so the temperature difference is lar ge. The maximum temperature difference is about 0.52 °C. In the experiment, thermocouples measured the temperature without distinguishing PCM and the skeleton; since the temperature difference is much smaller than the local temperature, this measurement method is acceptable.It is noted that the addition of the ceramic foam decreases the temperature difference significantly.

However, the role of natural convection is different for pure PCM and CPCM.

        <p>The contribution of natural convection to the melting of CPCM is plotted in Fig. 13 . The data is obtained by subtracting the melting fraction due to heat conduction from the total melting fraction at each time step. It is seen that the melting induced by natural convection increases with time, which may be attributed to the fact that the solid-liquid interface area increases as more PCM is melted. When the solid-liquid interface crosses the right wall, the interface area begins to decrease, however, the melting fraction continues to increase. It may be because the temperature of solid PCM increases due to heat conduction, which causes solid PCM melted more easily. The melting induced by natural convec-Fig. 13.

        <p>Fig. 14 shows the simulated stored energy of pure molten salt and CPCM. The stored energy consists of two parts: sensible heat energy and latent heat energy. The former is induced by the temperature increase of material while the latter is induced by the phase change of molten salt. It is seen from Fig. 14 that the sensible heat energy is much larger than the latent heat energy. This is due to the large temperature increment: the initial temperature is 27 °C; the final volume-averaged temperature, namely the temperature when the salt is completely melted, of pure PCM and CPCM is 289 °C and 282 °C respectively. The temperature increment is 262 °C and 255 °C respectively, leading to the large sensible heat energy.Fig. 14 shows the simulated stored energy of pure molten salt and CPCM.

This should be attributed to the faster temperature increase, as indicated in Fig. 8 . As the sensible heat storage results from the temperature increase of material, the faster the temperature rises, the faster the sensible heat energy is stored; moreover, the faster temperature increase leads to a higher melting rate and thus the faster latent heat storage.It is noted that both the sensible heat energy and the latent heat energy of CPCM rise faster than that of pure salt.

        <p>It is seen from Fig. 15 that the total stored energy of CPCM is lower than that of pure salt. CPCM contains only 85% molten salt and its final temperature is lower due to the shorter heating time. But its energy storage rate is improved by 40.3% than pure molten salt. Ceramic foam shortens the melting time and enhances the comprehensive energy storage performance.It is seen from Fig. 15 that the total stored energy of CPCM is lower than that of pure salt.

        <p>In the current study, the porous SiC ceramic foam was integrated with solar salt and the melting phase change heat transfer in the composite phase change material (CPCM) was studied. A visualised experiment was conducted to capture the solid-liquid phase interface, temperature field, etc. In addition, a representative elementary volume (REV)-scale simulation was performed to provide detailed heat transfer and flow information.

In the current experiment, the melting rate of molten salt/ceramic foam CPCM is increased by 41.3% compared to pure molten salt. (2) The temperature field of CPCM is more uniform.

        <p>The enhancement effect of ceramic foam is more significant in the region far away from the heat source. (3) Natural convection gradually dominates the heat transfer in pure salt while heat conduction is always the dominated heat transfer mechanism in CPCM. The enhancement of heat conduction is greater than the suppression of natural convection in CPCM, which leads to the overall enhancement of heat transfer.
