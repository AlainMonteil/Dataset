        <p>Here, we take a step closer toward chemical accuracy with a semiempirical method to correct the gas-phase energetics of PBE, PW91, RPBE, and BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functionals. The proposed two-step method is tested on a data set of 27 gas-phase molecules belonging to the carbon cycle: first, the errors are pinpointed based on formation energies, and second, the respective corrections are sequentially applied to ensure the progressive lowering of the data set's mean and maximum errors. We illustrate the benefits of the method in electrocatalysis by a substantial improvement of the calculated equilibrium and onset potentials for CO 2 reduction to CO on Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes. This suggests that fast and systematic gas-phase corrections can be devised to augment the predictive power of computational catalysis models.Here, we take a step closer toward chemical accuracy with a semiempirical method to correct the gas-phase energetics of PBE, PW91, RPBE, and BEEF-vdW exchange-correlation functionals.

        <p>For decades, considerable effort has been devoted to increasing the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT). This has been done by developing more accurate exchange-correlation functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level, [1][2][3] hybrid functionals, [4][5][6] and range-separated functionals. [7][8][9] In addition, different correction schemes have been developed to account for electron localization 10 or dispersion interactions. [11][12][13] Lately, machine learning schemes 14 have also been proposed to bypass Kohn-Sham equations. In general, these efforts include careful computational benchmarking and comparison to experiments. [15][16][17] An agreement has been reached in the scientific community about the level of theory required to simulate certain materials with a good tradeoff between computational time and accuracy. For instance, hybrid functionals are advisable for molecules and solids with localized electrons, while GGAs usually suffice for bulk and surface metals. 13,16 However, the choice is not trivial when dealing with systems where metals and molecules are involved and ought to be simulated at the same level of theory. In such a case, the accuracy may be improved by using GGA functionals and adding semiempirical corrections to the DFT energies of molecules, as done for thermochemical reaction energies of interest in catalysis, 18,19 formation and decomposition energies of solids, 20,21 and catalytic kinetic barriers. 22,23 In this article, we provide a simple and fast procedure for detecting gas-phase errors based on the formation energies of reactants and products calculated with DFT. Improving the description of the gas phase is shown to enhance catalytic predictive power by analyzing the electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction to CO on Au, Ag, and Cu electrodes. The reduction of CO 2 and CO (hereafter denoted as CO 2 RR and CORR, respectively) are of great importance in catalysis science and technology as they lead to valuable feedstocks and fuels such as methane, ethylene, ethanol, and formic acid while helping in balancing the carbon cycle. [24][25][26] Although DFT has been used to predict enhanced catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions, [27][28][29] it has been, so far, challenging to elaborate robust design routines for CO 2 RR and CORR to hydrocarbons and oxygenates. 30 Thus, the method presented here may help boost materials design via screening for those paramount reactions.For decades, considerable effort has been devoted to increasing the accuracy of density functional theory (DFT).

        <p>The reaction free energies were obtained as ΔG 0 = ΔE DFT + ΔZPE -TΔS 0 where ZPE is the zero-point energy contribution calculated from the vibrational frequencies obtained using the harmonic oscillator approximation. The standard total entropies (S 0 ) and the experimental standard free energies (ΔG 0 exp ) were obtained from thermodynamic tables [44][45][46] at T = 298.15 K. In cases where ΔG 0 exp was not tabulated, it was evaluated by combining entropy and enthalpy values: ΔG 0 exp = ΔH 0 exp -TΔS 0 exp . We did not include heat capacity effects as recent studies showed that formation energies are not significantly modified by them from 0 to 298.15 K. 21 Electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CO was modeled based on the free energy scheme described in previous reports, 47 making use of the computational hydrogen electrode 48 for the description of proton-electron transfers. The reaction pathway proceeds via CO 2 hydrogenation (step 1: CO 2 + H + + e -+ * → *COOH), followed by *CO formation (step 2: *COOH + H + + e -→ *CO + H 2 O(l)), and desorption (step 3: *CO → * + CO). In this approach, the onset potential is numerically equivalent to the additive inverse of the largest positive reaction energy considering steps 1 and 2 only (U onset = -max(ΔG 1 , ΔG 2 )/e -) as step 3 is not electrochemical. We note that alternative pathways for CO 2 RR to CO in the experimental literature suggest that CO 2 may be activated by an electron transfer prior to its adsorption, and the adsorbed species is stabilized by a hydrated cation close to the surface.

        <p>To pinpoint the errors, we first determined all deviations (ε T ) in the calculated free energies of formation of the molecules in data set A relative to the experimental ones using eq 2. We paid special attention to CO 2 and CO as they are the reactants of CO 2 RR and CORR, respectively (all reactions in data set B). For PBE, the error in CO 2 is ε T CO 2 = -0.19 eV, whereas that of CO is ε T CO = 0.24 eV. Thus, the magnitudes of the two errors are comparable but the signs are opposite. The CO 2 error appears in similar molecules such as HCOOH (ε T HCOOH = -0.19 eV) and CH 3 COOH (ε T CH 3 COOH = -0.15 eV) and is commonly referred to as the OCO backbone error in the literature. 18,19,32,34 Previous studies reported corrections of -0.45 eV for RPBE 19,32 and -0.59 eV for BEEF-vdW, 32 which agree well with our values of -0.46 and -0.56 eV, respectively. The small correction of -0.07 eV for CO(g) in RPBE is likely a reflection of RPBE's original fit against CO adsorption energies. 33 We note in passing that simultaneous OCO/H 2 corrections are also available in the literature for BEEF-vdW of 0.33/0.09, 32 0.41/0.09, 34 and 0.29/0.10 eV. 18 We continued the correction procedure with the simplest molecules in the list, namely, alkanes (only C-H and single C-C bonds) and observed an increasingly positive error depending on the number of hydrocarbon units (-CH x ) (see Table S6). For PBE, that error is on average ε CHx ≈ 0.03 eV/ CH x .

We find with RPBE that ΔG 0 DFT = 0.32 eV, whereas ΔG 0 exp = -0.44 eV, which corresponds to a large total error of ε T CH 3 COOH = 0.76 eV. According to Table 1, RPBE has errors associated to the description of CO 2 , the -COOH group, and the -CH 3 moiety in CH 3 COOH. If the errors pinpointed using data set A are indeed contributing to the large total error, then suitably correcting CO 2 and CH 3 COOH should lead to a sizable reduction of the total error. This is what we find as ∑ε T R = 2ε T CO 2 = -0.92 eV and ∑ε T P = ε CH x + ε -C = OO-= -0.19 eV so that ΔG 0 DFT,corr = -0.41 eV, which differs from the experimental value (ΔG 0 exp = -0.44 eV) by 0.03 eV only. To verify that the errors in the reaction energies of data set B are systematically reduced upon applying the corrections in Table 1, we followed a stepwise procedure. First, we applied The two values reported for -(CO)Owhen using BEEF-vdW are for carboxylic acids and esters (the latter in parentheses). All values are in eV. corrections to data set B only related to reactants (namely, CO 2 and CO). Next, we applied corrections related to products.

        <p>Indeed, Figure 3 compares CO 2 RR to CO on Au(111) single-crystal electrodes using PBE with (Figure 3b) and without (Figure 3a) gas-phase corrections applied to CO 2 and CO. Likewise, Figures S5 and S6 in the Supporting Information, Section S5 provide the data for Au(100) and Au(110). In Figure 3a, where DFT data appear as is, the reaction energy of eq 7 is 0.63 eV. Conversely, it is 0.20 eV in Figure 3b where the energies of CO 2 and CO have been corrected. For comparison, such difference is 0.20 eV in experiments 25 (it is 0.30 eV in Table S3. The difference stems from the liquid state of water in eq 7). In terms of the equilibrium potential of the reaction, this all means that PBE predicts it to be at -0.32 V versus RHE, whereas both the correction method and experiments set it at -0.10 V versus RHE. The difference is substantial and amounts to ∼220 mV. Note in passing that there are no changes in the energy differences between *COOH and *CO as the corrections are only applied to the gas phase.

        <p>We note that the sizable lowering of the error from 0.24 to 0.05 V is a direct result of correcting gas-phase energetics. To assess whether this is a particularity of Au(111) electrodes or part of a more general trend, we also compared the calculated and experimental onset potentials for Au(100), Au(110), Au poly , Ag(111), Ag poly , and Cu poly . The results in Figure 4a show that DFT data are systematically deviated from the parity line, which results in a MAE of 0.20 V and a MAX of 0.27 V. Conversely, the CO 2 and CO corrected data in Figure 4b are located around the parity line with MAE = 0.06 V and MAX = 0.09 V. Substantial improvements are also observed for Au(111) and Au(100) using gas-phase corrections with RPBE (see Figures S7 andS8). Thus, we conclude that models for CO 2 RR to CO may in general benefit from the gasphase corrections found in this work.We note that the sizable lowering of the error from 0.24 to 0.05 V is a direct result of correcting gas-phase energetics.

        <p>When interfaces between metals and fluids are simulated at the GGA level, sizable errors may appear in the description of the gas-phase molecules. Here, we proposed a two-step semi- empirical method to determine gas-phase errors based on the formation energies of 27 different molecules. Furthermore, implementing the corresponding corrections allow for predictions in the analyzed data set of CO 2 RR and CORR reaction energies that lower by 1 order of magnitude the average and maximum errors with respect to experiments. The method also shows that the errors for CO 2 and CO differ by ∼0.4 eV for all the examined exchange-correlation functionals. Thus, an intrinsic limitation of DFT exists for the accurate description of reaction energies containing these two molecules, as is the case for CO 2 reduction to CO, among others. Such limited description leads to inaccurate predictions of equilibrium and onset potentials, which may hinder the rational design of catalysts.When interfaces between metals and fluids are simulated at the GGA level, sizable errors may appear in the description of the gas-phase molecules.
