        <p>ABSTRACT: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) have emerged as next-generation semiconductor materials with outstanding optical and optoelectronic properties. Because of the high surface-to-volume ratio, the optical and optoelectronic performance and the colloidal stability of LHP NCs largely depend on their surface chemistry, especially the ligands and surface termination. On one hand, the capping ligands improve the colloidal stability and luminescence; on the other hand the highly dynamic binding nature of ligands is detrimental to the colloidal stability and photoluminescence of LHP NCs. In addition, the surface functionalization with desired molecules induces new functionalities such as chirality, light harvesting, and triplet sensitization through energy/electron transfer or use as X-ray detectors. In this review, we present the current understanding of an atomic view of the surface chemistry of colloidal LHP NCs, including crystal termination, vacancies, and different types of capping ligands. Furthermore, we discuss the ligand-induced functionalities, including photocatalysis and chirality.ABSTRACT: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP NCs) have emerged as next-generation semiconductor materials with outstanding optical and optoelectronic properties.

        <p>C olloidal nanocrystals are ligand-capped tiny particles with at least one of their dimensions in the range of 1-100 nm and are constituted of hundreds to thousands of atoms. [1][2][3][4][5] Because of their extremely small size, they exhibit a high surface-to-volume ratio; thus, the surfaces play a vital role in their optical, electronic, and catalytic properties. 4,[6][7][8][9] Importantly, materials at the nanoscale exhibit unique size-dependent properties that can be harnessed for a variety of applications. 6,8,10,11 Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most important classes of materials that exhibit size and shape-dependent optical properties. 4,12 Over the last few decades, colloidal semiconductor QDs with the compositions of II-VI and III-V groups have been greatly investigated regarding their synthesis and optoelectronic applications. 10,13,14 The emission color of QDs is precisely tunable across the visible spectrum of light by their size without changing the composition. 10,[13][14][15] However, these classical QDs require an epitaxially coated wide-bandgap inorganic shell that passivates the surface traps to achieve high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), while the organically passivated QDs exhibit low PLQY because of surface-related trap states. Over the last 7-8 years, the research focus has been partially shifted to the newly emerged colloidal lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals (NCs) because of their remarkable optical and optoelectronic properties, such as near-unity PLQY, narrow emission line widths, tunable emission color by halide composition and by accessing quantum confinement effects, suppressed blinking, and defect tolerant nature. 8,[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25] Unlike classical core-shell QDs, organic ligand-capped colloidal halide (Br and I) perovskite NCs without an inorganic shell exhibit extremely high PLQY because of their defect-tolerant nature. 20,26 These interesting properties confer them a multitude of applications, including light-emitting diodes (LEDs), near-eye displays for augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR), single-photon emission, photodetectors, lasers, and photovoltaics. 8,19,[27][28][29][30] Halide perovskites exhibit ABX 3 crystal structure, typically in cubic or orthorhombic phases, in which the divalent cation "B" is coordinated to six halides (X) in an octahedral fashion, while the monovalent cation "A" sits in and occupies the cuboctahedral cavity of eight BX 6 octahedral units. 8 The A is either an organic [typically methylammonium (MA + ) or formamidinium (FA + )] or inorganic (usually Cs + ) cation; B is Pb 2+ , Sn 2+ or Ge 2+ ; and X is a halide (Cl -, Br -, or I -). The optical properties of metal halide perovskite NCs are tunable across the visible spectrum to near-infrared by varying the composition of the three constituents (A, B, and X). After the early reports, [21][22][23]25,31,32 perovskite NCs have been greatly exploited regarding their synthesis with a wide range of A, B, and X compositions, properties, and applications. 8 In particular, inorganic lead halide perovskite NCs received special interest because of their superior stability and the ability to synthesize them with excellent shape control, along with high monodispersity and crystallinity compared with organic-inorganic hybrid counterparts. These NCs are being significantly studied regarding their use as light-emitting and -harvesting materials in LEDs and solar cells, respectively. 8,20,27,29,33,34 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) and electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQE) of halide perovskite NC-based solar cells and LEDs have continued to rise over the years and have surpassed 17% and 23%, respectively. 20,27 However, the optical properties of halide perovskite NCs are often hampered by halide vacancies on the surface and the defects formed by ligand detachment. The ligand binding to the surface of halide perovskite NCs is highly dynamic because of its ionic nature and, thus, leads to a detachment of ligands and removal of surface halides during the purification process that is necessary for device applications. Despite the defect tolerance nature, the detachment of ligands and halide atoms from the surface significantly reduces the PLQY because of the formation of nonradiative surface traps. 8,20,35,36 The surface ligands not only affect the PLQY of NCs but also the shape and size, along with their colloidal stability and assembly into thin films, which is crucial for device applications. Therefore, ligands and the passivation of surface traps play an essential role in modulating stability, luminescence, or charge carrier transport and perhaps even in the induction of new functionalities. 8,20,[37][38][39] Interestingly, the surface traps are removable by postsynthetic chemical treatments. Currently, understanding the surface chemistry through different characterization techniques, testing different ligands, postsynthetic surface treatment, ligand exchange, and surface functionalization for the introduction of new properties and improvement of the stability and PLQY of LHP NCs are the most active research directions in the field. 8 A large number of ligands and passivation approaches have been reported for improving the colloidal and phase stability and PLQY of LHP NCs (see Table 1). 8,20,39,40 This review presents a state-of-the-art understanding of the atomic and molecular view of the surface chemistry of ligandcapped colloidal LHP nanocrystals. We first present the possible mechanisms of ligand binding to the surface of LHP NCs and the defects formed upon the detachment of ligands and surface atoms and their consequences on the optical properties. The structural characterization of surfaces by different experimental techniques is presented. We then discuss the surface passivation mechanisms via in situ synthesis or postsynthetic ligand exchange and various strongly bounded ligands used to improve the stability and PLQY of LHP NCs. The functionalization of surfaces with different functional ligands for imparting new properties into LHP NCs is presented. Finally, we provide a brief outlook and future research directions with outstanding questions that remain in understanding surface chemistry, ligand exchange, and surface functionalization of LHP NCs.C olloidal nanocrystals are ligand-capped tiny particles with at least one of their dimensions in the range of 1-100 nm and are constituted of hundreds to thousands of atoms.

        <p>As discussed in the introduction, the surface atoms and ligands of colloidal semiconductor NCs play an important role in their optical and chemical properties because of their high surfaceto-volume ratio. 6,8,41,42 In particular, for LHP NCs, the ionic nature and weak interactions with ligands make them vulnerable to detachment of surface atoms and ligands, which leads to the formation of defects and, thus, the introduction of trap states that stimulate nonradiative recombination processes. However, the ionic character of the capping ligands allows the modification of the NC surface along with their properties and colloidal stability. Therefore, an atomic-level understanding of the surfaces of LHP NCs, in terms of crystal structure, surface defects, and surface termination, is the prerequisite for enabling a better tuning of their optical properties. 8,40,43,44 Accordingly, several studies have proposed the possibility of the existence of two different surface terminations for the typical orthorhombic phase 9-12 nm CsPbBr 3 NCs. 38,[45][46][47][48][49] The two types of terminations are CsBr (or Cs atoms substituted with ammonium ligands) and PbBr 2 , which are illustrated in Figure 1. 46 In this regard, Bodnarchuk et al. used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze the atomistic stoichiometry of the surface terminations and their inherent optoelectronic properties for CsPbBr 3 NCs. 38 They proposed the two surface terminations on the basis of the X/ Pb ratio, which can be measured by XPS or ICP mass spectrometry. 50,51 The ratio of X/Pb and X/Cs at the surface of typical 9-12 nm CsPbX 3 NCs is usually different (typically varies between about 2.7 and 3.3) from that of bulk (∼3). 38 The surface X/Pb ratio significantly increases with a decrease in the size of NCs because of the high surface-to-volume ratio. For an ideal cubic phase (or orthorhombic phase), the NCs adapt an (APbX 3 )(PbX 2 ) (AX)-type structure at a high X/Pb ratio (&gt;3), which corresponds to an APbX 3 core terminated by an inner shell of PbX 2 with an outer shell composed of monovalent cations (A: Cs + , FA + , or MA + ) and X anions (X: halides or carboxylic acid ligands). 38 However, the substitution of some of the A cations by ammonium ligands (A′) results in an A′X-type stoichiometry on the surface with an (APbX 3 )-(PbX 2 )A′X-type structure (Figure 1a). For a low X/Pb ratio (&lt;3), the NCs adapt an (APbX 3 )(AX)(PbX 2 )-type structure with a PbX 2 surface termination. 38 In this case, the ligands most likely bind to the PbX 2 terminal, and the structure Ligands and the passivation of surface traps play an essential role in modulating stability, luminescence, or charge carrier transport and perhaps even in the induction of new functionalities.As discussed in the introduction, the surface atoms and ligands of colloidal semiconductor NCs play an important role in their optical and chemical properties because of their high surfaceto-volume ratio. 6,8,41,42 In particular, for LHP NCs, the ionic nature and weak interactions with ligands make them vulnerable to detachment of surface atoms and ligands, which leads to the formation of defects and, thus, the introduction of trap states that stimulate nonradiative recombination processes.

        <p>becomes (APbX 3 )(AX)(PbX′ 2 )-type, where X′ is an oleate ligand. However, this PbX 2 termination is unlikely because it requires a dense packing of ligands to passivate the Pb surface atoms, which leads to steric hindrance and disturbs the Pb 2+ octahedral coordination. 38 Furthermore, it is predicted that the PbX 2 -type of termination leads to the formation of charge traps after the loss of only 25% of the ligands. 53 Therefore, the most realistic surface termination constitutes the (APbX 3 )(PbX 2 )[(A + A′)X] structure, in which (A + A′) is a mixture of A cations and alkylammonium cation ligands that provides colloidal stability. In addition, the (APbX 3 )(PbX 2 )[A(X+X′)] structure is also proposed, in which (X + X′) is a mixture of halides and oleate ligands. The (APbX 3 )(PbX 2 )[(A+A′)X]-type structure was further supported by 133 Cs direct excitation (spin echo) and surface-selective 2D dipolar 1 H → 133 Cs cross-polarization heteronuclear correlation (CP-HETCOR) NMR experiments (Figure 1c). 53 The spin-echo spectra consists of three main signals: (1) a high intensity one at 100 ppm, which was assigned to bulk CsPbBr 3 ; (2) a very low-intensity signal around 235 ppm, which was assigned to zero-dimensional Cs 4 PbBr 6 crystals; and (3) a low-intensity broad peak at around 170 ppm, which was attributed to cesium present on the surface. The signal attributed to surface Cs (170 ppm) shows higher relative intensity in a surface selective 2D 1 H → 133 Cs CP-HETCOR spectrum because such sites are likely coordinated to carboxylate or phosphonate ligands. The 1 H dimension 2D 1 H → 133 Cs CP-HETCOR NMR spectrum shows signals corresponding to the -NH 3 (6.5 ppm) and neighboring carbons of the carboxyl group (α-CH 2 , 3.0 ppm). The CH 2 along the alkyl chain (1.2 ppm) is expected to have higher intensities because the groups are adjacent to the surface of the CsPbBr 3 QDs and increase the dipole coupling to the surface.becomes (APbX 3 )(AX)(PbX′ 2 )-type, where X′ is an oleate ligand.

        <p>Additionally, the 207 Pb spin-echo spectrum (Figure 1d) shows a single peak at 200 nm similar to that reported for bulk MAPbBr 3 (400 ppm) and CsPbBr 3 (250 ppm). 54,55 Surfaceselective 207 Pb NMR spectra obtained through 207 Pb → 1 H CP-HETCOR experiments enabled the detection of the lead atoms proximate to the surface. 56 The similarity in the Pb projection of the surface selective 2D 207 Pb → 1 H CP-HETCOR spectrum and the 207 Pb spin-echo spectrum suggests that most of the lead atoms are present in a bulk environment, which corresponds to the complete PbBr 6 octahedra. 53 In addition, the 1 H → 133 Cs and the 207 Pb → 1 H 2D NMR correlation experiment spectra indicate the presence of -NH 3 + and α-CH 2 protons of the oleate and alkylammonium surface ligands. 53 Taking into account that signals related to surface ligands could only be observed for 133 Cs, as previously described, a preferential termination of Cs could be assumed. 53 Additionally, RESPDOR experiments determined the internuclear distances between -NH 3 + protons to Cs and Pb atoms, where the simulation of multispin RESPDOR dipolar dephasing curves indicate a (CsPbBr 3 )-(PbBr 2 )(ABr) termination, where A is Cs or alkylammonium. 53 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is usually used to retrieve the surface characterization of lead halide perovskites. However, there are two main drawbacks hampering the acquisition of HRTEM images of perovskite NCs. [59][60][61] One is the structural instability of the perovskite NCs under the electron beam; another is the limitation of detecting the tilt of the PbX 6 octahedra. Therefore, noninvasive and versatile X-ray scattering methods, ranging from common XRD measurements to GISAXS and GIWAXS, are applied as complementary probes for HRTEM. 8 We also would like to refer readers to a previous review, which shed light on the necessity and importance of applying X-ray scattering, especially real-time investigations, on perovskite films. 62 For instance, through the use of synchrotron X-ray total scattering, Bertolotti et al. 57 proposed three structural models by varying the stoichiometry and termination and found that the dominant surface termination is CsBr in the fully stoichiometric composition of CsPbBr 3 (Figure 2a). In contrast to PbX 2 and CsX terminations, Manna et al. discerned the surface termination of perovskite NCs consisting of Br - and R-NH 3 + by multilayer diffraction, along with proper modeling (Figure 2b). By comparing the experimental and calculated patterns that resulted from tuning the Pb-Pb distance, stacking disorder, and other fitting parameters, it was possible to discard the PbBr 2 -and CsBr -terminations (fitting plot in Figures 2c,d) and ascertain the Br -and R-NH 3 + termination (Figure 2b). Likewise, by taking advantage of the sensitivity of multilayer diffraction to interparticle spacing, they demonstrated that no discernible change is found in a diffractogram with the introduction of erucic acid, while the interparticle distance and stacking disorder decreased in the octylamine-containing sample, which means there was no influence of oleic acid (OA) on the surface passivation. 58 This finding is in accordance with the work of De Roo et al., 35 which is explained in more detail in Ligand Binding to Nanocrystal Surface.Additionally, the 207 Pb spin-echo spectrum (Figure 1d) shows a single peak at 200 nm similar to that reported for bulk MAPbBr 3 (400 ppm) and CsPbBr 3 (250 ppm). 54,55 Surfaceselective 207 Pb NMR spectra obtained through 207 Pb → 1 H CP-HETCOR experiments enabled the detection of the lead atoms proximate to the surface. 56 The similarity in the Pb projection of the surface selective 2D 207 Pb → 1 H CP-HETCOR spectrum and the 207 Pb spin-echo spectrum suggests that most of the lead atoms are present in a bulk environment, which corresponds to the complete PbBr 6 octahedra. 53 In addition, the 1 H → 133 Cs and the 207 Pb → 1 H 2D NMR correlation experiment spectra indicate the presence of -NH 3 + and α-CH 2 protons of the oleate and alkylammonium surface ligands. 53 Taking into account that signals related to surface ligands could only be observed for 133 Cs, as previously described, a preferential termination of Cs could be assumed. 53 Additionally, RESPDOR experiments determined the internuclear distances between -NH 3 + protons to Cs and Pb atoms, where the simulation of multispin RESPDOR dipolar dephasing curves indicate a (CsPbBr 3 )-(PbBr 2 )(ABr) termination, where A is Cs or alkylammonium. 53 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is usually used to retrieve the surface characterization of lead halide perovskites.

        <p>The soft ionic nature of LHPs confers their preference for ionic surface ligands that exhibit highly dynamic binding and tend to detach from the surface by washing, aging, or dilution of colloidal NCs. 8,35,41,50,64 In addition, these processes result in the dissolution or degradation of surface atoms, which leads to a disordered surface with considerable defects that reduces the long-term stability and PLQY. 20,35,50,[64][65][66] The defects act as trap sites for optically excited, as well as electrically injected, charge carriers and excitons. These surface defects are more relevant in perovskite NCs than in bulk because of their higher proportion of surface atoms and reduced size. 40 Generally, LHPs are expected to be highly defect-tolerant materials unlike classical semiconductors, such as Si, GaAs, CdTe, CdSe, and InP, where a small population of defects can be extremely detrimental for PLQY and charge carrier mobility. 19,26,67,68 This is because the majority of intrinsic defects (A and X site vacancies) of LHPs are associated with the shallow states (the localized levels within or close to the valence and conduction bands); thus, they do not affect the optical, and optoelectronic properties (Figure 3a). 8,18,69,70 The defect-tolerant nature of LHPs enables the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells with polycrystalline films, which are crystallized at relatively low temperatures and ambient conditions and are characterized by a high density of defects. Similarly, colloidal LHP NCs with near-unity PLQY can be prepared at room temperature using technical grade reagents and without any surface passivation, which is compulsory to prepare highly luminescent classical colloidal quantum dots. 8 Despite significant studies on the defect tolerance of LHPs, this complex phenomenon has not been fully understood, especially for colloidal inorganic LHP NCs. Several studies show that the PLQY of CsPbX 3 LHPs is very sensitive to surface defects caused by the detachment of ligands and surface atoms (X, Cs, and Pb) and is significantly reduced after aging or washing. A theoretical evaluation of the ligand desorption and the consequent formation of vacancies on (APbX 3 )(PbX 2 )(AX′)-type surface termination shows structural integrity without the formation of localized states even after 75% loss of the (AX′) shell. 38 However, this effect is not appreciated for the PbX 2 surface termination, in which structural deformation and the presence of localized states were observed at only 25% detachment of the (PbX 2 ) shell. 38 This suggests that the dangling bonds caused by halide vacancies and ligand detachment on the surface of LHP NCs can create trap states under certain circumstances. In this regard, density functional theory calculations by du Fosséet al. 63 suggest that the defect states are pushed into the bandgap by a destabilizing local electrostatic potential (Figure 3b). Besides, the defect tolerance of LHP NCs is strongly dependent on the lattice parameter and, thus, the size of the halide. The lattice constant of MAPbX 3 perovskites decreases with the change of halide from I to Br to Cl and, thus, leads to stronger interactions between halide and Pb 2+ dangling bonds. This causes the formation of deep traps upon the detachment of surface chloride ions. However, the formation energies of surface defects in CsPbI 3 are low, and their energy levels do not form midgap states. 71 Therefore, iodine and bromidebased perovskites exhibit high defect tolerance compared with chloride perovskites. [72][73][74] Furthermore, ab initio calculations on surface halide vacancies of CsPbX 3 (X = I, Br, Cl) show that the halide defects are shallow in CsPbI 3 , a little deeper in CsPbBr 3 , and midgap in CsPbCl 3 . 74 This is consistent with the low PLQY of CsPbCl 3 NCs (PLQY = ∼1-5%) compared with that of CsPbBr 3 and CsPbI 3 NCs (PLQY = ∼80-90%), regardless of their synthesis approach. 24,75 The influence of halide ion vacancies on the PLQY of LHP NCs was further studied by the deliberate creation of surface defects, and it was found that the defect tolerance is in the order of CsPbI 3 &gt; CsPbBr 3 &gt; CsPbCl 3 . 74 However, interestingly, the shallow states near the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, as well as the deep traps, can be removed by passivation with appropriate ligands and reconstruction of the surface with metal halides (Figure 3b). 70 Various postsynthetic surface treatments using different ligands have been developed to recover the photoluminescence of LHP NCs, as well as to improve their long-term stability through strong NC-ligand interactions. 8,40,76 ■ LIGAND BINDING TO NANOCRYSTAL SURFACE It is fundamentally necessary to understand how capping ligands bind to the surface of nanocrystals to have control over the surface chemistry of new ligands used for strong surface-toligand interactions and surface functionalization with desired ligands and, thus, improve the optical and long-term stability of colloidal LHP NCs. 8,[78][79][80] The capping ligands of LHP NCs can be classified into three types, as per covalent bond classification: (1) L-type [two-electron donor ligands (Lewis bases)], (2) Z-type [two-electron acceptor ligands (Lewis acids)], and (3) X-type (one-electron donor ligands). 40,81 Because the surface of an LHP NC is ionic, the surface ligands are ionic and they fall into the X-type category (e.g. alkylammonium, alkyl carboxylates). The most widely used capping ligands are long-chain alkylamines and alkylacids, of which oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) as the most widespread pair. 23,24,28 The OAm/OA ligand pair for the synthesis of LHP NCs was first employed by Protesescu et al. in 2015 23 and showed great promise for tuning the size, shape, and halide composition of colloidal perovskite NCs with excellent monodispersity and high photoluminescence quantum yield. 8,17,82 The OA/OAm acid-base pair first transforms into an oleate anion and oleylammonium cation through proton transfer, and then, these ions are likely to bind to the surface of LHP NCs. 83 In addition, ligands help to dissolve the precursors in a solvent medium and, thus, initiate the reaction that leads to colloidal perovskite NCs. 75,77,84 The typical synthesis of LHP NCs by hot injection using the OAm/OA ligand pair involves various reactions, as shown in eqs 1-4 for CsPbBr 3 , CsPbI 3 , and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 NCs (Reproduced with permission from ref 77.

        <p>Many studies are still trying to elucidate the binding mode of the OAm/OA ligand pair to LHP NC surfaces, despite being widely used ligands, using various characterization techniques, with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as the most outstanding ones. 35,51,53,87,88 On the basis of the reported studies, there are several proposals regarding the binding nature of the OA/ OAm ligand pair, as illustrated in Figure 4a. 82 For instance, De Roo et al. 35 first studied the OA/OAm ligand chemistry on the surface of CsPbBr 3 NCs through NMR characterization. Through analysis of the difference in concentrations of OAm and OA in the 1 H NMR spectra, they identified the presence of oleylammonium derived from the protonation of OAm [Figure 4b (left)]. In addition, the positive cross-peaks in nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY-NMR) suggested that the oleic acid and octadecene do not bind to the surface [Figure 4b (right)]. 35 On the basis of the 1 H NMR and NOESY-NMR studies, De Roo et al. proposed that the oleylammonium bromide acts as a ligand and binds to bromine atoms by electrostatic cation-anion interactions or through hydrogen bonds (H•••Br), while the Br -ions bind to the Cs + or Pb 2+ cations (Figure 4a-i). 35 Conversely, Ravi et al., 51 analyzed the surface of CsPbBr 3 NCs through 1 H NMR and NOESY-NMR (Figure 4c) and proposed that the oleylammonium cations act as capping ligands by substituting some of the Cs + cations on the surface, as well as by forming hydrogen bonds with neighboring Br -atoms on the NC surface. Despite the low energy required for the replacement of Cs with 1). The functional groups of the ligands are classified according to their binding site and are labeled with green or red dotted circles. It is likely that the green-labeled functional groups occupy A sites, while the red-labeled ones occupy halide vacancies. The A cations (MA + , FA + , Cs + ), A cation vacancies, halides (Cl -, Br -, or I -), halide vacancies, and lead atoms are labeled with solid green, dotted green, solid red, dotted red, and black, respectively. oleylammonium cations, the hydrogen bonds with neighboring Br -ions stabilize the NCs. 51 In addition, the study suggests that the oleate ions do not bind to the surface; however, they neutralize the charge on the surface by the formation of equilibrium with the oleylammonium ligands (Figure 4a-ii). Theoretical studies by ten Brinck et al. further suggested that the oleylammonium cations act as capping ligands substituting 50% of the A cations on the surface of LHP NCs. 89 Contrary to previous reports, it was proposed that oleate molecules occupy the halide vacancies on the surface (Figure 4a-iii). Another possible mechanism is that both the oleate and oleylammonium ions interact with the CsPbBr 3 NCs surface through Cs + and Br -ions, respectively, as proposed by Brutchey et al. (Figure 4a-iv). 88 However, yet another mechanism was determined by a recent study through 1 H and 133 Cs NMR spectroscopy, where oleylammonium substituted the Cs + vacancies, and the oleate ions interacted with the rest of the Cs + ions (Figure 4a-v). 87 Despite several proposed ligand-binding mechanisms, the substitution of A cations and halide ions with oleylammonium and oleate ligands, respectively, has been widely accepted and used to explain many experimental studies. In addition, it is well studied that these ligands (OA/OAm) weakly bind to LHP NCs and that their interactions with NC surfaces are highly dynamic. Thus, the ligands are easily detached from the NC surface during a wash with polar antisolvents or by aging. The ligand detachment leads to the formation of vacancies at the A site and X sites, which thus results in spectral shift and a drastic reduction of PLQY. 8,50 In particular, iodide atoms were found to expel from the NC surface upon contact with polar solvents. 50 It is well understood and accepted that the exploration of and control over the ligand chemistry of LHP NCs are essential to enhance long-term colloidal stability against polar solvents, heat, and light. Therefore, over the years, a large number of studies have been focused on exploring different types of ligands for the effective passivation of LHP NC surfaces, with the aim of improving the colloidal stability and PLQY and imparting new properties and functionalities.Many studies are still trying to elucidate the binding mode of the OAm/OA ligand pair to LHP NC surfaces, despite being widely used ligands, using various characterization techniques, with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as the most outstanding ones. 35,51,53,87,88 On the basis of the reported studies, there are several proposals regarding the binding nature of the OA/ OAm ligand pair, as illustrated in Figure 4a. 82 For instance, De Roo et al. 35 first studied the OA/OAm ligand chemistry on the surface of CsPbBr 3 NCs through NMR characterization.

        <p>Considering the ease of ligand detachment, which is accompanied by a decrease in the PLQY and stability of OAm/OA-capped LHP NCs, it is crucial to explore different capping ligands either by direct synthesis (in situ) or postsynthetic surface passivation treatments (Figure 5a). 8 The first approach that was considered to improve the PLQY of the purified OAm/OA-capped LHP NCs was to add excess OAm and OA to passivate the surface traps. 8,35,77 Such postsynthetic surface treatments have been greatly exploited using different ligands (see Ligand Exchange section), as well as halide salts, and have been reviewed. 8,20,39,76,86,90 For instance, several reports demonstrate that in situ (during synthesis) incorporation of certain additives, such as metal halides [e.g., ZnBr 2 , FeBr 3 , SnX 4 (X� Cl, Br, I)], alkali metals, alkaline earth metal salts, or thiocyanate, improve the PLQY, as well as colloidal stability. [91][92][93][94][95][96][97][98] Among all, the metal halide (e.g. PbBr 2 , ZnBr 2 , CuBr 2 , InBr 3 , AgBr, etc.) salts have been widely used to manipulate the defects and optical properties of perovskite NCs. 64,[99][100][101] However, the position of the added metal cations in the host NC lattice is still unclear. In the case of postsynthetic treatment, the added metal halides repair the surface by filling halide vacancies on the surface of LHP NCs. Nevertheless, the dopant-enhanced optical and structural stabilities of LHP NCs have often been studied by PL and XRD. [99][100][101][102] One proposed hypothesis for the dopant-enhanced stability of LHP NCs is because of the formation of a (110) surface with lead-halide-enriched CsPbX 3 NCs. 102 Another method to overcome the instability arising from the acid-base equilibrium of ligands is to carry out the synthesis in the absence of OAm or OA. For instance, upon the absence of OA, primary amines (L-type ligands) yield stable LHP NCs with near-unity PLQY, as demonstrated by Zhong and coworkers. 103 However, a new synthetic approach was developed using oleic acid as the capping ligand and quaternary alkylammonium halides as precursors, which allowed purified colloidal perovskites to be obtained with higher stability. 104 In particular, a ligand of special interest is didodecyl dimethylammonium bromide (DDA + Br -), which has been shown to be effective in the enhancement of stability and PLQY by restoring the surface of CsPbBr 3 through postsynthetic treatment with a mixture of PbBr 2 + DDABr. 52 The main advantage of this type of ligand is that it is pH-independent, unlike octylammonium bromide. In addition, the DDABcapped LHP NCs have great promise for LED fabrication because of their shorter alkyl chain length compared with OAm/OA. The large chain length of the OAm/OA pair can hinder the charge transport, and thus, only an EQE of 0.12% was observed in early research. 25 Consequently, a two-step ligand exchange process was developed, which involves an intermediate OAm desorption step followed by treatment with halide-ion-pair ligands (short-chain alkyl halides), to result in highly stable CsPbX 3 perovskite NCs with an increased charge transport. 105 In connection with improved stability and PLQY, a wide range of ligands have been tested by improving the ligand-NC surface interaction strength. The ligands can be classified into a few types on the basis of the functional group that binds to the NC surface and are illustrated in Figure 5b. In the following sections, we discuss some of the widely explored ligand types for effective surface passivation of LHP NCs either by direct in situ synthesis or postsynthetic ligand exchange (Table 1).Considering the ease of ligand detachment, which is accompanied by a decrease in the PLQY and stability of OAm/OA-capped LHP NCs, it is crucial to explore different capping ligands either by direct synthesis (in situ) or postsynthetic surface passivation treatments (Figure 5a). 8 The first approach that was considered to improve the PLQY of the purified OAm/OA-capped LHP NCs was to add excess OAm and OA to passivate the surface traps. 8,35,77 Such postsynthetic surface treatments have been greatly exploited using different ligands (see Ligand Exchange section), as well as halide salts, and have been reviewed. 8,20,39,76,86,90 For instance, several reports demonstrate that in situ (during synthesis) incorporation of certain additives, such as metal halides [e.g., ZnBr 2 , FeBr 3 , SnX 4 (X� Cl, Br, I)], alkali metals, alkaline earth metal salts, or thiocyanate, improve the PLQY, as well as colloidal stability.

        <p>Phosphorus-Based Ligands. The functional group in ligand chemistry plays an essential role in binding to the surface of NCs, with the acid-base theory being a predominant mechanism. In this regard, numerous studies involve alkyl phosphonic acids as capping ligands because of their high interaction ability with LHP NCs. [106][107][108][109][110] In fact, alkylphosphonate ligands were previously explored for the stabilization of classical colloidal QDs (CdSe, PbSe). 111,112 The Cs + and Pb 2+ ions of LHPs are hard and soft acids, respectively. Conversely, the OAm/OA ligands are hard Lewis bases, while the phosphine ligands are soft bases. Taking the acid-base theory into account, a higher affinity is expected for Pb 2+ toward phosphine ligands than for Pb 2+ toward OAm/ OA. 110,113 For instance, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) has been employed in conjunction with OAm/OA. 114 A strong coordination of the P�O group of TOPO to the NC surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements, which appreciated a C-P stretching peak at 1155 cm -1 (a characteristic peak for TOPO) even after purification. A remarkable increase in stability was observed with TOPO as the photoluminescence was maintained after long exposures to ethanol. 114 In a subsequent study, Almeida 115 It was determined through 1 H NMR studies that the TOPO was not present on the NC surface, which is covered by only oleate ligands. However, the 31 P NMR studies showed the interaction of the protonated TOPO with the PbBr 2 precursor, 116 which resulted in competition with OA. 115 Thus, the protonation of the TOPO caused by the acidic environment tunes the reactivity of the PbX 2 to control the size of the nanocrystals. Furthermore, 31 P NMR and XPS studies by Li et al. show that phosphine ligands of different types [trioctylphosphine (TOP), diphenyl-phosphine (DPP), and tributylphosphine (TBP)] can bind to a LHP NC surface to improve its tolerance to ethanol, water, and UV light. 110 The 31 P NMR of TOP was unaltered in the presence of cesium oleate, while a downfield shift was observed with the addition of PbBr 2 , which suggests its interaction with the Pb 2+ atoms. 110 In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed a peak at 132 eV that corresponds to P 2p 3 , thereby establishing the existence of TOP on the CsPbBr 3 NC surface. 110 Similarly, a new synthetic approach was reported involving alkyl phosphonic acids as surfactants for obtaining colloidal CsPbBr 3 NCs with octahedral shape, high colloidal stability, and near-unity PLQY (Figure 6a). 106 The surface of tetradecyl phosphonic acid (TDPA)-capped CsPbBr 3 NCs were analyzed by XPS, FTIR, and STEM-EDS, and these measurements indicated the presence of TDPA at the surface. In particular, the XPS analysis revealed the Cs/Pb/Br/P molar ratio of 1/ 1.06/2.19/0.77, which indicates that the alkyl phosphonates replaced most of the bromides on the surface. 106 Interestingly, the NCs capped with TDPA ligands exhibit a truncated octahedron shape covered by Pb-terminated facets because of a strong binding affinity of the phosphonate to Pb 2+ ions. These NCs exhibit near-unity PLQY without postsynthetic treatment, and the optical properties remain unaltered after dilution, thereby suggesting these ligands strongly passivate the NC surface. Furthermore, 31 P NMR studies were performed for a more exhaustive study of the binding mode of phosphonic acids. 112,117 The parent OAm/OA ligands can also be replaced by octylphosphonic acid ligands through postsynthetic surface treatment, and the 2D solid-state 31 P-1 H NMR suggests that these ligands preferentially bind via the negatively charged P-O -termination, which leaves the P�O and P-OH groups free to form interligand hydrogen bonds. 118 The phosphonate ligands also strongly passivate the NC surface, which results in a well-purified colloidal CsPbBr 3 NC solution with a PLQY over 3 times higher than that of untreated NCs. 118 In another report, Zhang et al. showed the advantage of using oleyl phosphonic acid (OLPA) over linear chain alkyl phosphonic acids because their higher solubility in apolar solvents enables the synthesis of LHP NCs at lower temperatures, which offers size tunability. 109 They were able to synthesize CsPbBr 3 NCs with sizes down to 5 nm, thereby showing quantum confinement effects. The NCs were found to be passivated with hydrogen phosphonates, phosphonic acid anhydrides, and phosphonates species, and thus, they exhibited excellent colloidal stability. It is worth mentioning that the perovskite NCs were treated with trimethylchlorosilane (TMS-Cl) and the corresponding products were analyzed via 31 P NMR to study the binding modes of the OLPA molecules. The TMS-Cl, generally as halides or chalcogenides, reacts with phosphonate species of the colloidal NCs, which yields the TMS-substituted compounds that can be analyzed by 31 P NMR.Phosphorus-Based Ligands. The functional group in ligand chemistry plays an essential role in binding to the surface of NCs, with the acid-base theory being a predominant mechanism. In this regard, numerous studies involve alkyl phosphonic acids as capping ligands because of their high interaction ability with LHP NCs. [106][107][108][109][110] In fact, alkylphosphonate ligands were previously explored for the stabilization of classical colloidal QDs (CdSe, PbSe). 111,112 The Cs + and Pb 2+ ions of LHPs are hard and soft acids, respectively. Conversely, the OAm/OA ligands are hard Lewis bases, while the phosphine ligands are soft bases. Taking the acid-base theory into account, a higher affinity is expected for Pb 2+ toward phosphine ligands than for Pb 2+ toward OAm/ OA. 110,113 For instance, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) has been employed in conjunction with OAm/OA. 114 A strong coordination of the P�O group of TOPO to the NC surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements, which appreciated a C-P stretching peak at 1155 cm -1 (a characteristic peak for TOPO) even after purification. A remarkable increase in stability was observed with TOPO as the photoluminescence was maintained after long exposures to ethanol. 114 In a subsequent study, Almeida 115 It was determined through 1 H NMR studies that the TOPO was not present on the NC surface, which is covered by only oleate ligands.

        <p>Despite the numerous studies that have explored the use of phosphonic acids as capping ligands for CsPbBr 3 nanocubes, 106,[108][109][110] the use of these ligands for nanoplatelets (NPLs) has been rarely reported. A passivation strategy employing hexyl phosphonate (HPA) as a capping ligand allowed the synthesis of blue-emitting CsPbBr 3 NPLs with remarkable PLQY. 107 The NMR measurements on liquid samples showed a shift, along with a broadening, in the signal when comparing free HPA (40.1 ppm) and HPA-capped NPLs (34.7 ppm), thereby indicating that the ligands interact with the NPLs (Figure 6b). Furthermore, the solid-state magicangle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements suggested the presence of residual OAm ligands on the surface. They were identified using 1 H-13 C cross-polarization (CP) MAS NMR because of a strong deshielding of the carbon, which is directly bonded to the -NH 3 + group (shifted to higher ppm values) (Figure 6c). 107 Additionally, the solid-state 1 H-31 P CP MAS NMR revealed four peaks (31.6, 29.8, 25.7, and 24.9 ppm) that do not correspond to free hexylphosphonate acid, cesium phosphonate (19.5 and 23.4 ppm), or oleylammonium phosphonate (20.4 and 28.0 ppm), thereby leading to the conclusion that they indicate different binding modes of hexylphosphonate acid on the nanoplatelet surface (Figure 6d). 107 In addition, 133 Cs MAS NMR experiments revealed the structure of the HPA-NPLs (Figure 6e). Furthermore, the broad peaks existed between 60 and 100 ppm, which were shifted to lower frequencies with respect to bulk microcrystalline CsPbBr 3 (101.7 ppm), and the absence of the impurity cesium hexyl phosphonate phase (CsHPA) revealed that the broad resonances corresponded to the HPA-NPL. These broad NMR resonances are likely due to the local disorder caused by the anisotropic shape that characterizes semiconductor NCs. 119,120 Sulfur-Based Ligands. The ligands with sulfur-based functional groups, such as sulfonic acids, thiolates, or thioethers, were also explored toward enhancing the stability and luminescence enhancement because of their strong interaction with Pb 2+ ions. 122,124 In this regard, Koscher et al. first reported the use of thiocyanate salt (ammonium or sodium) to passivate uncoordinated lead atoms for improving the quantum yield for fresh and old samples and maintaining colloidal stability of CsPbBr 3 NCs (Figure 7a). 121 Despite expected lead-thiocyanate bond formation, the XPS results revealed that the thiocyanate did not bind to the NC surface because there were no peaks corresponding to sulfur. 121 It was proposed that the thiocyanate passivation removes the excess lead atoms from the surface, which is consistent with the Pb/ Br ratio of 1:3 and the absence of a sulfur peak in the XPS (Figure 7c). 121 Later, several studies explored thiocyanates as passivating agents to obtain highly luminescent CsPbX 3 NCs. 93,121,125 A few studies reported the formation of thiocyanate-Pb bonds after the surface passivation. After the treatment with thiocyanate, a broad peak around 2060 cm -1 could be seen in the FTIR spectra (Figure 7b), which corresponds to the C�N bond linked to the sulfurcoordinated lead atom and may undergo a slight shift depending on which group it is bonded to (NH 4 + or Na + ). 126 The treatment with sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) resulted in a distinctive peak at 1560 cm -1 that was attributed to the C�O stretching of sodium oleate. In contrast, the passivation with NH 4 SCN resulted in a peak at 1712 cm -1 related to the C�O stretching of oleic acid. Therefore, it seems that the Na + ion interacts with the oleic acid, while the thiocyanate interacts with the Pb 2+ atoms. Another type of sulfur containing ligand, for example, is didodecyldimethylammonium sulfide (DDA + S 2-), which is analogous to didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), and has shown an effective postsynthetic surface passivation of CsPbBr 3 NCs in enhancing their PLQY and stability against air and light. 127 Despite the crucial role of sulfur in the passivation of the NC surface, the binding mode of DDA + S 2-to the NC surface was unclear. Interestingly, the DDA + S 2-ligands, along with OA, self-assembles CsPbBr 3 nanocubes into nanowires through halide vacancies. 128 Similarly, benzenesulfonic acid ligands were also used in an attempt to increase the stability, luminescence, and electronic coupling in NC films. 129 The low PLQYs of LHP NCs are often attributed to the presence of halide vacancies that result in uncoordinated Pb atoms, 8,64,74,130 and these lead-rich surfaces show a remarkable trapping effect 131 because of the orbital composition of the conduction band 16,89,132 being counterproductive for their luminescence efficiency. Nevertheless, the strong ionic sulfonates can tightly bind to the Pb 2+ ions, thereby eliminating the exciton trapping probability. 129 The CsPbBr 3 NCs prepared using dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) exhibited PLQY up to 90%, which was retained for more than five months of storage, thereby showing a remarkable enhancement of stability (Figure 7e). 129 Furthermore, the chemical shift and broadening of the 1 H NMR signal for the hydrogen peaks of the benzene indicate the strong coordination of DBSA to the surface of the NCs (Figure 7d). XPS studies further confirmed the presence of the sulfonate groups together with their binding mode, which showed the expected S 2p and O 1s XPS results. In addition, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and thermogravimetric (TG) measurements confirmed the stronger interaction of DBSA ligands firmly binding to the uncoordinated Pb 2+ ions on the surface of NCs through sulfonate head groups. 129 In other words, the sulfonate groups fill the halide vacancies.Despite the numerous studies that have explored the use of phosphonic acids as capping ligands for CsPbBr 3 nanocubes, 106,[108][109][110] the use of these ligands for nanoplatelets (NPLs) has been rarely reported.

        <p>Alternatively, alkyl thiols (R-S-H) are an excellent class of ligands for NCs. They have the strong tendency to form sulfur-metal bonds and, thus, they can confer excellent stability to NCs. [133][134][135][136] Alkyl thiols have been extensively used for the capping of colloidal gold, 137 silver 138,139 NCs, and classical QDs. [133][134][135][136] The use of thiol ligands have been extended to LHP NCs as they have the potential to bind to the surfaces through the formation of S-Pb bonds. 123 In this context, postsynthetic ligand exchange has been used to substitute the OAm/OA ligands with octanethiol, which leads to an increase in luminescence, stability, and conductivity. 123 The surface binding of thiol molecules was confirmed by XPS, in which two peaks at 158 and 169 eV related to the Pb-S bond were detected after the treatment with thiol (Figure 7f). 123 On the contrary, dithiols together with OAm can cause a decrease in the luminescence intensity because of the transformation from CsPbBr 3 NCs to Cs 4 PbBr 6 NCs. 140 This transformation also occurs with an excess of OAm, but it is reinforced in the presence 1,3-propanedithiol (PDT) and can be explained according to the hard-soft acid-base theory. The ability of dithiols to bind strongly to PbBr 2 results in the dissolution of CsPbBr 3 NCs with the consequent transformation into Cs 4 PbBr 6 NCs. Further studies have indicated the presence of thiol signals in XPS (bound thiolate and unbounded thiol) 141 and FTIR (800 cm -1 sulfur-metal bonds), 142 which are characteristics for sulfur, thereby proving that the dithiols are acting as capping ligands that display increased stability and better size distribution for Cs 4 PbBr 6 NCs. In a subsequent study, Uddin et al. compared the effectiveness of various ligands, such as dodecanethiol (DDT), trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP), ammonium thiocyanate (NH 4 SCN), tetradecyldimethyl (3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide inner salt (sulfo-betaine), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), to improve photoluminescence and its mechanistic exploration. 124 A greater increase in luminescence and long-term stability were observed for DDT, which showed additional long-term stability. However, we believe further studies are required to rationalize the differences in the stability of LHP NCs with different ligands. It was proposed that the DDT protonates the oleic acid ions, thereby leading to the formation of thiolates and thioethers that then bind to undercoordinated Pb atoms at the CsPbBr 3 NC surfaces to result in near-unity PLQY. 124 In conclusion, the strong interaction of alkyl phosphonic acids, sulfonates, and thiolates toward Pb 2+ ions leads to high affinity to the LHP NC surface and, thus, results in improved PLQY and chemical stability.Alternatively, alkyl thiols (R-S-H) are an excellent class of ligands for NCs. They have the strong tendency to form sulfur-metal bonds and, thus, they can confer excellent stability to NCs.

        <p>Bidentate and Multidentate Ligands. Bidentate ligands, i.e., having two functional groups that can bind to NCs, are of special interest 37,[143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150][151][152] because of their ability to improve the stability of NCs through the chelate effect. 153 The bidentate ligands show great promise for efficient surface passivation and photoluminescence enhancement. Importantly, the bidentatecapped NCs retain their PL efficiency after several cycles of washing. To address the issues associated with ligand detachment, Krieg et al. proposed the use of long-chain zwitterionic molecules (sulfobetaines, phosphocholines, γamino acids, etc.) as capping ligands for CsPbX 3 NCs, and these ligands showed a remarkable increase in durability and stability. 37 The presence of an anionic and a cationic group on the same molecule prevents them from being neutralized by a Bronsted acid-base equilibrium, and their binding to the NC surface is kinetically stabilized by the chelate effect. 144,153 The NMR spectra confirmed that the zwitterionic ligands are the only species present on the NC surface. 37 In addition, DFT studies suggest that the dimethylammonium group of the zwitterionic ligand can be accommodated at the cation site of the surface despite its bulkiness. Furthermore, the ligand binding energies (ca. 40-45 kcal/mol) suggest high affinity of the ionic species for the surface, without significant energetic difference between the conventional and the zwitterionic passivation, thereby supporting the theory that they are stabilized because of the chelating effect. 37 Interestingly, the number of carbons present in the sulfobetaine ligand has a substantial effect on the synthesis: four carbons are favored for iodine perovskites, likely because of the greater anion cation distance, while three carbons are preferred for chlorine and bromine perovskites. 37 Subsequent studies have shown the effectiveness of employing soy lecithin, a phospholipid, as a capping agent that confers high stability because it maximizes the repulsion between nanocrystals due to its brushlike structure to prevent aggregation. 146 The efficient ligand binding mode was confirmed by 1 H and 31 P NMR spectroscopy of lecithin-capped NCs that showed a line broadening compared with the spectra of lecithin and decomposed NCs. This was attributed to an increase in the ligand's rotational correlation time resulting from the association with the NCs. In addition, DOSY data showed an increase in the diffusion coefficient of the ligands upon association with the NCs that is in agreement with the values previously reported for zwitterions. 37 Further studies analyzed the effectiveness of various zwitterionic polymers for improving the stability and PLQY of NCs, where the parent ligands were replaced with zwitterionic polymers. 147 The long-chain ligands such as OAm/OA hinder the charge carrier transport in LHP NC films because of their insulating nature. 144 In general, the shorter the ligands are, the better the charge carrier transport is. However, the NCs exhibit relatively less colloidal stability with short-chain ligands. Therefore, short-chain bidentate ligands, for example, 2,2′-iminodibenzoic acid (IDA), were explored by replacing the original ligands through postsynthetic ligand exchange. 154 XPS and IR spectroscopy analysis suggest that IDA molecules bind to CsPbI 3 NCs through their carboxyl groups. The strong interaction between the bidentate ligand and the PbI 2 surface atoms through the two carboxyl groups leads to reduced surface traps and, thus, an increase in photoluminescence, stability, and charge transport. 144 Successively, another dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, and OAm were used for the synthesis of colloidal MAPbBr 3 perovskites. 150 The presence of two carboxyl groups enabled binding to two exposed Pb atoms on the NC surface 144 and showed an improvement in environmental stability. 150 Recent studies reported the surface passivation of LHP NCs with phthalimide, 148 thereby showing a large increase in environmental and photostability. XPS studies revealed a lower Br/Pb ratio after the passivation in contrast to the lead-rich surface prior to treatment, which is detrimental to their optical properties. 35 Another important class of bidentate ligands are amino acids with at least an amine and a carboxylic acid group on them that are naturally available. For example, L-cysteine, an amino acid, has been employed in a reprecipitation method to passivate MAPbBr 3 NCs, thereby resulting in highly stable and luminescent supercrystals (self-assembled nanocubes). 155 The FTIR spectra suggest a strong interaction of L-cysteine (L-cys) as the stretching mode of C�O (1635 cm -1 ) with respect to free L-cys (1577 cm -1 ) changes upon binding. 156 Furthermore, the absence of the S-H vibrational peak in the spectrum of L- cys-capped NCs indicates the formation of a coordination bond between the sulfhydryl group and the Pb 2+ atoms. 155 Bidentate ligands are used for the stabilization of perovskite solar cells. One example involves 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MP) for the passivation of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 films, in which the presence of the sulphydryl group adjacent to the nitrogen favors the interaction with the Pb 2+ atoms on the surface by chelating effect. 145 In comparison with monodentate analogues, such as pyridine (Py) 157,158 and p-toluenethiol (PTT), 158 2-MP displayed a high anchoring strength, and a CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -based planar n-i-p structured solar cell with the addition of 2-MP exhibited an increase in power conversion efficiency from 18.35% to 20.28%, along with a substantial increase in stability against moisture and other environmental factors. 145 As the studies suggest that the increase in binding moieties of ligands leads to an enhanced stability and PLQY of LHP NCs, various multidentate ligands have been exploited. 159,160 For example, multidentate block copolymer (P2VP) was used to obtain a micelle shell on the surface of CsPbBr 3 NCs. 159 The pyridine functional groups of the block copolymer show affinity for the PbBr 2 precursor and, thus, increase its solubility and serve as a template for the growth and nucleation of the NCs in the polymer shell. 161 In addition, the polymer shell protects the surfaces of the NCs to significantly improve their stability against polar solvents. Another multidentate ligand of interest is polyethylenimine, which serves as a template for the assembly of CsPbBr 3 perovskite nanoplatelets and passivates the bromine vacancies, thus improving colloidal stability. 162 Furthermore, the short-chain length of the polyethilenimine allows for carrier hopping and tunneling between adjacent NPLs, thus favoring charge transport. Alternatively, multidentate ligands L-glutathione and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were used to obtain stable red-emitting mixed halide LHP NCs that exhibit red electroluminescence (620 nm) with an EQE higher than 20%. 163 Moreover, ligandligand interactions of the multidentate molecules result in a ligand shell on the nanocrystal surface, while the multidentate ligand interactions with the surface remarkably suppress the surface defects.Bidentate and Multidentate Ligands. Bidentate ligands, i.e., having two functional groups that can bind to NCs, are of special interest 37,[143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150][151][152] because of their ability to improve the stability of NCs through the chelate effect. 153 The bidentate ligands show great promise for efficient surface passivation and photoluminescence enhancement. Importantly, the bidentatecapped NCs retain their PL efficiency after several cycles of washing. To address the issues associated with ligand detachment, Krieg et al. proposed the use of long-chain zwitterionic molecules (sulfobetaines, phosphocholines, γamino acids, etc.) as capping ligands for CsPbX 3 NCs, and these ligands showed a remarkable increase in durability and stability. 37 The presence of an anionic and a cationic group on the same molecule prevents them from being neutralized by a Bronsted acid-base equilibrium, and their binding to the NC surface is kinetically stabilized by the chelate effect. 144,153 The NMR spectra confirmed that the zwitterionic ligands are the only species present on the NC surface. 37 In addition, DFT studies suggest that the dimethylammonium group of the zwitterionic ligand can be accommodated at the cation site of the surface despite its bulkiness. Furthermore, the ligand binding energies (ca. 40-45 kcal/mol) suggest high affinity of the ionic species for the surface, without significant energetic difference between the conventional and the zwitterionic passivation, thereby supporting the theory that they are stabilized because of the chelating effect. 37 Interestingly, the number of carbons present in the sulfobetaine ligand has a substantial effect on the synthesis: four carbons are favored for iodine perovskites, likely because of the greater anion cation distance, while three carbons are preferred for chlorine and bromine perovskites. 37 Subsequent studies have shown the effectiveness of employing soy lecithin, a phospholipid, as a capping agent that confers high stability because it maximizes the repulsion between nanocrystals due to its brushlike structure to prevent aggregation. 146 The efficient ligand binding mode was confirmed by 1 H and 31 P NMR spectroscopy of lecithin-capped NCs that showed a line broadening compared with the spectra of lecithin and decomposed NCs. This was attributed to an increase in the ligand's rotational correlation time resulting from the association with the NCs. In addition, DOSY data showed an increase in the diffusion coefficient of the ligands upon association with the NCs that is in agreement with the values previously reported for zwitterions. 37 Further studies analyzed the effectiveness of various zwitterionic polymers for improving the stability and PLQY of NCs, where the parent ligands were replaced with zwitterionic polymers. 147 The long-chain ligands such as OAm/OA hinder the charge carrier transport in LHP NC films because of their insulating nature. 144 In general, the shorter the ligands are, the better the charge carrier transport is. However, the NCs exhibit relatively less colloidal stability with short-chain ligands. Therefore, short-chain bidentate ligands, for example, 2,2′-iminodibenzoic acid (IDA), were explored by replacing the original ligands through postsynthetic ligand exchange. 154 XPS and IR spectroscopy analysis suggest that IDA molecules bind to CsPbI 3 NCs through their carboxyl groups. The strong interaction between the bidentate ligand and the PbI 2 surface atoms through the two carboxyl groups leads to reduced surface traps and, thus, an increase in photoluminescence, stability, and charge transport. 144 Successively, another dicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, and OAm were used for the synthesis of colloidal MAPbBr 3 perovskites. 150 The presence of two carboxyl groups enabled binding to two exposed Pb atoms on the NC surface 144 and showed an improvement in environmental stability. 150 Recent studies reported the surface passivation of LHP NCs with phthalimide, 148 thereby showing a large increase in environmental and photostability. XPS studies revealed a lower Br/Pb ratio after the passivation in contrast to the lead-rich surface prior to treatment, which is detrimental to their optical properties. 35 Another important class of bidentate ligands are amino acids with at least an amine and a carboxylic acid group on them that are naturally available. For example, L-cysteine, an amino acid, has been employed in a reprecipitation method to passivate MAPbBr 3 NCs, thereby resulting in highly stable and luminescent supercrystals (self-assembled nanocubes). 155 The FTIR spectra suggest a strong interaction of L-cysteine (L-cys) as the stretching mode of C�O (1635 cm -1 ) with respect to free L-cys (1577 cm -1 ) changes upon binding. 156 Furthermore, the absence of the S-H vibrational peak in the spectrum of L- cys-capped NCs indicates the formation of a coordination bond between the sulfhydryl group and the Pb 2+ atoms. 155 Bidentate ligands are used for the stabilization of perovskite solar cells.

In addition to the above-discussed ligand types, various other inorganic ligands, such as tetrafluoroborates and silanes, have also been explored to enhance the optical and chemical stability of LHP NCs. It was demonstrated that the postsynthetic surface treatment with tetrafluoroborate salts significantly enhances the photoluminescence of CsPbX 3 NCs (Figure 8a). 164 Quantitative XPS analysis (Figure 8b) revealed that the removal of some of the surface lead atoms acts as traps for the charge carrier and, thus, results in enhancement of the PLQY. 121,166 It was proposed that the BF 4Tetrafluoroborates and Silane Ligands.

[168][169][170][171][172][173] Because the colloidal perovskites are vulnerable to water, silane ligands were extensively used to protect the surface of LHP NCs. The use of silane ligands often leads to the formation of a protective shell on the NC surfaces. For instance, alkyltrichlorosilanes (R-SiCl 3 ) can be used as Cl-sources for an anion exchange with CsPbBr 3 NCs that result in CsPbCl 3 NCs coated with siloxane shells. The CsPbCl 3 NCs show improved long-term stability against water and increased PLQY. 174 In particular, dodecyltrichlorosilane (DTS) forms a hydrophobic layer around the NCs upon reaction with carboxyl groups or water molecules, which leads to the formation of silols that coordinate with the surface lead atoms. The shift of the Si-O-Si antisymmetric stretching modes (970-1200 cm -1 ) in the FTIR spectra suggests that the Si-O-Si groups coordinate to the NC surfaces with the disappearance of the Si-Cl bands (562 and 585 cm -1 ) that were present in pure DTS. The displacement of OAm by DTS can be supported by the absence of the N-H bending mode peaks (1644 cm -1 ) in the Raman spectra of DTS NCs. However, FTIR and Raman data show that a fraction of carboxylates remain bound to the surface after DTS anion exchange because of the fact that the carboxylate-ligand-related shoulder peaks remain present at 1435 and 1420 cm -1 . 175 These studies suggest that the silane ligands exhibit higher binding affinity than amines. 35,176 The two most extensively used silanes for SiO 2 shell coating on NCs are 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and tetramethoxysilane (TMOS). 165,168,177,178 These have also been used to passivate (in situ, as well as postsynthetic) CsPbBr 3 NCs, which has significantly improved stability against environmental factors, long-term storage, and polar solvents because of the formation of a cross-linking SiO 2 matrix by hydrolysis of the silyl ether groups. 165,177 The hydrolysis reaction can take place in the presence of water or with a slight addition of a base. The FTIR spectra show the characteristic peaks at 2923 and 2854 cm -1 , which can be assigned to the C-H vibrations of OAm and APTES, respectively (Figure 8c). 179 The presence of the vibration of Si-O-C at 1080 cm -1 implies that the APTES was functionalized to the NC surface. 180 The binding energies corresponding to Cs 3d suggest the presence of only one type of Cs + in APTESnanoplatelets (Figure 8d). The Si 2p signal at 102 eV in the XPS spectra further confirms the existence of APTES on the surface (Figure 8e). The vibration bands of Si-O-Si (1105 cm -1 ) and Si-OH (958 cm -1 ) result from the hydrolysis of APTES. In addition, the Si/O atomic ratio (1:2) reveals the formation of a SiO 2 coating on the surface by hydrolytic condensation of the APTES. 165 As summarized above, the chemistry of ligands and their interactions with LHP NC surfaces play an important role in the optical and electronic properties, as well as the chemical stability, and thus, are crucial for corresponding optoelectronic devices. Consequently, many studies are still being focused on optimizing the surfaces and ligands of LHP NCs to maximize their properties, as discussed in later sections.-on the surface of NCs. 167 Conversely, silane-based ligands have often been used for silica shell coating on colloidal NCs.

        <p>Postsynthetic ligand exchange is an inevitable process for many colloidal NC systems to improve their stability, dispersibility, and to impart desired properties and functions. It enables the surface functionalization of NCs with desired molecules that are not possible to use as ligands during synthesis and is often used to tailor the properties of NCs in accordance with the desired applications. In addition, this strategy is critical for the phase transfer of NCs from aqueous to organic solvents and vice versa with the use of respective ligands. Therefore, ligand exchange on colloidal NCs is a foundation for their applications. Over the years, ligand exchange has been implemented on a wide range of colloidal NC systems, including metals and classical QDs. The ligand exchange in LHP NCs is relatively less explored than in classical NC systems. Moreover, the exchange mechanism and the surface chemistry of the NCs after the ligand exchange are yet to be fully explored. As discussed above, the soft ionic nature of perovskites make the ligands more dynamic on the NC surface and often leads to their degradation of phase transformation. 50,78,[222][223][224] The interaction strength between the NC surface and the foreign molecules often drives the ligand exchange process, and the interactions can be either covalent or electrostatic.Postsynthetic ligand exchange is an inevitable process for many colloidal NC systems to improve their stability, dispersibility, and to impart desired properties and functions.

        <p>binding ligands and to improve the conductivity of corresponding NC films and, thus, their performance in optoelectronic devices by reducing the chain length of the ligands. 76,86,192,225 In this regard, Pan et al. 192 demonstrated the replacement of native long-chain oleylamine (OAm) and oleic acid (OA) ligands with a relatively short ligand, didodecyl dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), through ligand exchange. The ligand exchange has been carried out by sequential addition of OA and DDAB ligand to the purified LHP NCs in toluene. It was found that the addition of OA is critical for the desorption of native OAm from the NC surface through protonation; otherwise, it leads to the degradation of NCs. Importantly, the DDAB ligands facilitate the charge carrier transport in LHP NC films and, thus, enables the fabrication of efficient LEDs. 191,192,226,227 Several other studies have also found that quaternary alkylammonium halides (R 4 NX) dramatically improve the stability and PLQY of NCs after postsynthetic ligand exchange through efficient passivation of surface traps (A and X sites). 47,228 The R 4 NX molecules can simultaneously exchange both anionic (typically carboxylates that occupy X sites) and cationic (A site) ligands from the surface of LHP NCs (Figure 9a). 47 Furthermore, it was found that the R 4 NBr molecules can replace the native ligands of CsPbBr 3 NCs without the assistance of excess OA ligands; however, excess R 4 NBr molecules can lead to the degradation of LHP NCs. 47,229 The proton-free R 4 NX-ligandcapped NCs are more stable than primary ammonium-halideprotected NCs. In particular, the R 4 NX molecules with two long alkyl chains and two methyl groups impart the NCs with excellent colloidal stability and high PLQY even after washing with polar solvents. However, the study by Quarta et al. 230 suggests that primary amines can also be used for the effective replacement of the native oleate or oleylammonium ligands from CsPbBr 3 NCs and passivate the NC surfaces to achieve near-unity PLQY. However, excess addition of amines leads to etching of PbX 2 from the surfaces of the NCs and even their degradation. Although the ligand exchange enables the replacement of native ligands with amines of different carbon lengths, the poor colloidal stability of ligand-capped LHP NCs limits their applications. For instance, Ye et al. 225 found that the replacement of a short-long-chain with long-chain acidbase pair (OAm and OA) drastically improves the colloidal stability and the device performance of the corresponding LEDs. Besides, various other exchanging ligands, including thiols; 123,200,231,232 thionyl halides; 233 phosphonic acids; 49,118,234 phenethylammonium (PEA + ); 235 cinnamate acid; 236 chiral molecules; 237 and zwitterionic molecules (including bi-and multidentate ligands), such as iminodibenzoic acid, 154 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-glutathione (GSH), 163,214 trithiocarbonate (TTC), 238 heterocyclic aromatic carboxylates, 143 and zwitterionic polymers, 147,152,239 have been potentially exploited to replace native ligands of LHP NCs. In addition, neutral ligands, such as carboxylic acid, sulfonic acid, and phosphonic acids, can replace the alkylammonium cations, as well as etch the surface, of LHP NCs. 49 The higher the acidity of the ligands, the higher the etching; therefore, ligands such as dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid can cause complete degradation. 49 Most of these studies have aimed at improving the stability, PLQY, and performance in LEDs through surface passivation of A and X site vacancies. Among all, significant attention has been paid to replacing native ligands with zwitterion molecules and polymers that have more than one binding site for enhanced ligand-surface interactions. Furthermore, the purification of colloidal NCs by the addition of an antisolvent, usually methyl acetate (MeOAc), is an important postprocessing step for device applications. Interestingly, the washing step results in ligand exchange because of the atmospheric moisture-induced hydrolysis of the antisolvent, MeOAc, into acetic acid, which then replaces the native oleate ligands of LHP NCs (Figure 9b). 240 In addition, the native oleylammonium ligands that remain on NCs are replaceable with small molecular cations, like formamidinium, by treating them with respective molecular halides, for instance, formamidinium halide (Figure 9b-iii). 240 The replacement with small molecular cations has only been demonstrated on NCs deposited on a substrate.

        <p>The ligands not only improve the optical properties and chemical stability but also induce phase transformations in CsPbX 3 NCs depending on the ligand type and concentration. Early studies on LHP NCs demonstrated the ligand-induced transformation of bulk 3D perovskites into 2D NPLs by ultrasonication. 242 The ligands either exfoliate 3D perovskites or dissolve into precursors and then recrystallize into 2D NPLs. 8 One of the most commonly observed phase transformations is the cubic CsPbX 3 to the rhombohedral Cs 4 PbX 6 phase (Figure 10a), 241,243,244 which is induced by a change of the surface ligand and recrystallization process. 241 The transformation is reversible and is controllable by varying the ratio of OAm to OA-capping molecules or intercalating PbX 2 . 241,243 The size uniformity and the chemical stability of the derived Cs 4 PbX 6 NCs was enhanced by the addition of alkyl thiols. 140 This transformation of the cubic CsPbBr 3 phase to the rhombohedral Cs 4 PbBr 6 phase could be followed by XRD. The suppression of the dispersion peaks at 15.1°and 30.1°, together with the appearance of a new peak at 26.1°, corroborate the loss of the pristine phase with the following transition to Cs 4 PbBr 6 NCs, as can be seen in Figure 10b. 241 This has been supported by TEM images where it was possible to observe the gradual decomposition into lamellar structures, sheets, platelets, and amorphous material, as well as conversion to homogeneous-sized Cs 4 PbBr 6 NCs (Figure 10c). 241 Another transformation, 3D CsPbBr 3 NCs to 2D CsPb 2 Br 5 nanosheets, was demonstrated by excess addition of PbBr 2 (CsPbBr 3 + PbBr 2 = CsPb 2 Br 5 ) or an environment triggering the formation of PbBr 3 -complexes. 245,246 The latter transformation starts with a ligand (dodecyl dimethylammonium bromide) exchange step and concurrently forms [PbBr 3 ] - complexes. Then, the [PbBr 3 ] -complexes react with Cs + to result in the formation of CsPb 2 Br 5 . 246 In an another work, Fanizza et al. demonstrated the transformation of CsPbBr 3 NCs into 1D tetragonal nanowires or 0D rhombohedral Cs 4 PbBr 6 , depending on the addition of either oleyl amine or OA. 247 The structural transformations are often analyzed by GIWAXS and XRD, along with optical characterization. 8,247 ■ IMPARTING OF NEW FUNCTIONALITIES BY LIGANDS Ligand exchange not only improves the stability and PLQY of LHP NCs through strong binding but also imparts new properties and functions using specific ligands of interest. 8,[248][249][250][251][252] In addition, functional ligands allow the possibility of modulating the properties of LHP NCs by introducing new features. 8 Consequently, numerous studies have emerged demonstrating the possibility of inducing new functionalities to LHP NCs through surface functionalization (or surface adsorption) of different molecules of interest either by direct synthesis or through postsynthetic treatments.

        <p>Photoexcited Charge Transfer to Surface-Anchored Molecules. Because they have emerged as excellent semiconductor materials for visible light absorption and efficient charge carrier generation and transport, LHP NCs have started to receive significant attention for photocatalytic applications through the efficient extraction of photogenerated charge carriers. 8,[266][267][268][269][270][271][272][273] The charge carriers of LHP NCs are generally extracted using specific ligands or small molecules that interact with their surfaces through electrostatic interactions. A good alignment of energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) of the molecules and perovskite NCs is also important for the favorable charge transfer across the interface. 266,274 A variety of molecules have been exploited for the efficient extraction of the photoexcited charge carriers (electron and hole) from LHP NCs (Figure 11). The extracted charge carriers have also been used to drive photoredox organic chemical reactions 238,250,270,272,[275][276][277][278][279] or CO 2 reduction on the surface of LHP NCs on the basis of charge or energy transfer from LHP NCs to nearby molecules (Figure 11). 8,266,268,269 For example, Jin et al. 238 demonstrated the polymerization of trithiocarbonate (TTC) ligand on the surface of CsPbBr 3 NCs upon photoexcitation, which leads to the formation of core-shelltype CsPbBr 3 -polymer NCs that exhibit improved stability in air, water, and UV light illumination. The charge transfer from perovskite NCs to surface-bound TTC ligands drives the polymerization reaction. Similarly, the photoexcited CsPbBr 3 NCs also catalyze cis-trans isomerization and intermolecular cycloaddition reactions in the molecules anchored to the surface of NCs. 250,280 The molecules are often coupled to LHP NCs with either carboxylate, amine (or ammonium), or thiol functional groups to test the photocatalytic reactions. 248,250,262,277,[280][281][282][283][284][285] For instance, Lin et al. 280 demon-strated triplet energy transfer (TET) from LHP NCs to surface-bound carboxylate-linked polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon acceptors for diastereomeric syn-selective 2 + 2 cycloadditions. In this case, the LHP NCs act as templates to carry out intermolecular cycloaddition reactions by anchoring the molecules on NCs with close proximity using carboxylic or amine functional groups. Different research groups have explored the triplet sensitization via TET transfer in LHP NC-organic molecular systems. 248,250,270,278,280,281,283 In most cases, the sensitizers with carboxylate or amine groups are used to attach to the surface of LHP NCs because the energy transfer is highly dependent on the distance between the donor (LHP NC) and acceptor (e.g., triplet emitters). In this regard, 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (PCA) molecules (triplet acceptors) were anchored onto the CsPbBr 3 NC surface through the carboxyl group, and it was found that the TET occurs only for quantum confinement NCs. 283 The linear correlation of TET rate with carrier probability density at the surface of NCs suggests the Dexter-type TET mechanism. 283,258 In the case of surface-bound Rhodamine B (RhB), the quenching of LHP NC emissions, along with a subsequent increase in fluorescence of chromophores, suggests the singlet energy transfer mechanism. 257 Interestingly, it was found that the energy transfer mechanism (Forster or Dexter) depends on the bandgap of the LHP NCs with respect to that of RhB. The rate constants suggest a Forster energy transfer for CsPbBr 3 -RhB assemblies, while CsPb(Br 1-x Cl x ) 3 -RhB assemblies favor the Dexter-type mechanism. 257 In a recent study, Martin et al. 258 reported a photocatalytic transformation of surface-anchored diamine to N-N heterocyclization reaction through a sequential electron transfer from transition-metal-doped LHP NCs. The surface-bound diamine requires two simultaneous photo-oxidation events for each reaction cycle.

        <p>Alternatively, a few studies have demonstrated the energy/ electron transfer from LHP NCs to nonbinding molecules w i t h o u t h a v i n g c a r b o x y l i c , a m i n e , o r t h i o l groups. 250,255,263,264,270,272,274,278,279 The photoexcited energy of LHP NCs can either directly transfer to free molecules in solution 255,263,264,270,272,279 or via the molecules attached on the NC surface. 250 In these cases, the free molecules dynamically interact with the surfaces of the NCs and, thus, lead to an energy/electron transfer. This process has been explored to carry out triplet sensitization, organic reactions, and CO 2 reduction. For instance, Yuan et al. 279 reported photocatalytic oxidative dimerization of α-aryl ketonitriles using CsPbBr 3 perovskite NCs, in which the reactant molecules dynamically attach to the surfaces of NCs. In general, such photocatalytic C-C coupling reactions proceed through a radical-mediated reaction pathway. 272,279 Furthermore, the photoexcited charge carriers of CsPbBr 3 NCs have also been used to catalyze organic reactions with C-N and C-O bond formations from nonbinding reactant molecules. 270 Interestingly, small molecules that have either sulfur or oxygen or nitrogen atoms can efficiently extract the photoexcited electrons or holes from LHP NCs. 264,286,287 It is most likely that these atoms facilitate the adsorption of the molecules on the surface of LHP NCs. However, in-depth studies are needed to understand the interactions of different molecules on the surface of LHP NCs. Nevertheless, the native ligands (typically OAm and OA) strongly influence the excited-state interactions of LHP NCs with charge acceptor molecules. DuBose et al. 274 investigated the influence of the surface ligands of CsPbBr 3 NCs on the excited-state interactions with methyl viologen (MV 2+ ) for three different ligands: typical OAm/OA pair, PbSO 4 -oleate, and DDAB. It was found that despite the relatively weak complexation of MV 2+ with the DDAB ligand environment, it exhibits the highest electron transfer efficiency of 73%. 274 Thus, it is important to note that the combination of the three factors, namely, surface binding strength, interfacial electron transfer rate, and stabilization of the charge transfer product, dictates the photocatalytic efficiency. In some cases, the ligands facilitate the charge transfer process by channeling the flow of charges to free molecules. The excited electrons/energy first transfer to surface-bound chromophores, which then transfer to acceptors in bulk solution. 250,278 This approach has been applied to achieve up-conversion emission through triplet sensitization, 278 as well as for cis-trans isomerization stilbene molecules and ring-closing organic reactions. 250 Furthermore, the energy transfer from LHP NCs to nearby emitters exhibits large Stokes-shifted emission, and this concept has been used for the realization of scintillators for α particles and X-rays because they emit stable radioluminescence upon excitation. 288 Induced Chirality through Surface Ligands. Recently, low-dimensional chiral perovskites have received significant research attention because of their interesting properties and technological applications, such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized photoluminescence (CPL), nonlinear optical effects, 3D display, ferroelectricity, and spintronics, which has attracted the interest of numerous research studies. [293][294][295] The chirality in LHP NCs is generally induced through chiral ligands or trough self-assembly into helical architectures using chiral templates. 8,296,297 The chiral ligands on LHP NCs allow access to chiroptical properties that cannot be achieved by achiral perovskites with a centrosymmetric structure. In 2003, Billing et al. 298 demonstrated the use of chiral molecules [methylbenzyl ammonium (MBA)] to crystallize organic-inorganic hybrid 1D [(S)-C 6 H 5 C 2 H 4 NH 3 ]-[PbBr 3 ] perovskites. However, it took until 2017 to study the chiroptical properties of 2D-layered [(S)-MBA] 2 PbI 4 and [(R)-MBA] 2 PbI 4 perovskites. The CD spectra of [(S)/(R)-MBA] 2 PbI 4 -layered perovskites exhibit oppositely signed peaks at their excitonic absorption, while the (S)/(R)-MBA alone does not show any CD signal at these wavelengths. After this work, numerous studies have been reported on the preparation of chiral LHPs by the incorporation of chiral organic cations such as (S)/(R)-MBA into the framework of layered iodide perovskites (Figure 12a), [299][300][301][302] in addition to the possibility of modulating the CD signal from 495 to 474 nm by varying the bandgap through control of the ratio of iodide and bromide. 303 The use of other chiral aromatic ligands such as (S)/(R)-1-(2-naphthyl)ethylamine [(S)/(R)-NEA] is also effective in inducing chirality because of the interligand πstacking interactions, which is also observed for (S)/(R)-MBA. [303][304][305][306] The versatility of this strategy has also been extended to obtain lead-free chiral perovskite thin films with considerable polarization anisotropy. [307][308][309] Subsequently, the concept has been extended to obtain chiral LHP NCs that exhibit CPL. 237,[310][311][312][313][314] Chiral LHP NCs have received increasing attention, and a number of reports have been published over the years (Table 2). In particular, numerous studies have been carried out inducing chirality in perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs). 312,313 This is because the NPLs exhibit a higher surface-to-volume ratio that leads to a higher ligand density and, thus, they show a relatively high degree of chirality. Chiral perovskite NPLs or nanosheets can be prepared by a typical ligand-assisted reprecipitation approach using a mixture of chiral ligands [e.g. (S)/(R)-MBA-Br or methylphenethylammonium bromide (S)-MPEABr] with long chain ligands that help to stabilize the NPLs. 312,315 The CD spectra of NPLs exactly overlap with their extinction spectra that are controllable by the thickness. However, thickness-tunable colloidal chiral LHP NPLs have not yet been obtained. It is most likely that the degree of chirality reduces with increasing NPL thickness because of reduced chiral ligand density on the surface with respect to volume. Importantly, the ratio of chiral to achiral ligands plays an important role in the colloidal stability and the degree of chirality because of the competitive binding of the ligands. In general, reduced amounts of achiral ligands improve chirality; however, it affects the stability of NCs. By optimizing the amount of achiral and chiral ligands, Yan and co-workers 315 achieved a dissymmetry factor (g-factor) of 6.5 × 10 -3 for 2D hybrid perovskite nanosheets. Very recently, Hubley et al. 313 demonstrated dissymmetry factors up to g lum = 4.3 × 10 -3 and g abs = 8.4 × 10 -3 for hybrid LHP NPLs synthesized by optimizing the mixture of chiral and achiral ligands. They found that too high or too low of a molar fraction of chiral to achiral ligands results in a decrease in the chiroptical signals because of the formation of polydisperse thicknesses and different ligand binding orientations. Moreover, small structural variations in chiral ligands significantly affect the magnitude and sign of the CD signals, and the study found that dimethylbenzylammonium chiral ligands, along with achiral octylammonium ligands, were found to be efficient in yielding chiral NPLs with relatively high g-factors (Figure 12b). 313 In addition, several attempts were made in inducing the chirality in bulklike LHP nanocubes using chiral ligands. 237,310,316 In this regard, Kim et al. 310 proposed both ligand-controlled synthesis and postsynthetic ligand exchange to obtain chiral FAPbBr 3 NCs using the short chiral ligands (R)-2-octylamine and (S)/(R)-MBA-Br. The anchoring of (R)-2-octylamine to FAPbBr 3 NCs results in chiral perovskite NCs that emit CPL with a relatively high luminescence dissymmetry (g lum ) factor of 6.8 × 10 -2 . However, the chiral FAPbBr 3 NCs obtained by postligand exchange with (S)/(R)-MBA-Br molecules exhibit a g lum of ±1.18 × 10 -2 . The postsynthetic ligand exchange strategy has also been extended to obtain chiral quantum-confined LHP NCs with intense signals in circular dichroism using a variety of chiral ligands. 317 Despite significant progress in chiral LHP NCs, the origin of chirality is still not well understood. Luther and co-workers proposed that the chiral ligands anchored on the surface of LHP NCs induce centro-asymmetric distortion in the surface of the perovskite lattice, thereby leading to a chiroptical response. 318 In addition, it is noteworthy to mention the induced chirality in LHP NCs by self-assembly 291,319,320 or through the surface functionalization of achiral perovskites on chiral helical fibers (Figure 12c,d), the surface chemistry plays an important role. 292,320,321 However, the g-factors reported for LHP NCs are considerably lower than reported for chiral plasmonic NCs. We refer the reader to the previous reviews for extensive information on chiral perovskite thin films and nanocrystals. 296,[322][323][324] ■ SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Over the last 8 years, LHP NCs have emerged at the forefront of colloidal semiconductor nanomaterials for various applications because of their interesting optical and optoelectronic properties. The rapid developments in the field regarding their preparation with controlled dimensions and composition have led to a greater understanding of their properties. They have already shown great promise as efficient light sources for LEDs, lasers, and single photon emission. In addition, they are gaining interest as light-harvesting materials for photocatalysis, as well as NC-based solar cells with improved long-term stability. Despite significant progress in the field, the poor stability of LHPs and their vulnerability toward antisolvent-induced purification is a major obstacle to advancing their applications. The aging of the colloidal NC solution or purification process often leads to the detachment of ligands because of weak ionic ligand-surface interactions. The ligand detachment leads to the formation of surface traps and, thus, significant reduction in PLQY. The surface traps can be passivated and, thus, can recover the photoluminescence by passivation with ligands that bind strongly to the NC surface.Alternatively, a few studies have demonstrated the energy/ electron transfer from LHP NCs to nonbinding molecules w i t h o u t h a v i n g c a r b o x y l i c , a m i n e , o r t h i o l groups. 250,255,263,264,270,272,274,278,279 The photoexcited energy of LHP NCs can either directly transfer to free molecules in solution 255,263,264,270,272,279 or via the molecules attached on the NC surface. 250 In these cases, the free molecules dynamically interact with the surfaces of the NCs and, thus, lead to an energy/electron transfer. This process has been explored to carry out triplet sensitization, organic reactions, and CO 2 reduction. For instance, Yuan et al. 279 reported photocatalytic oxidative dimerization of α-aryl ketonitriles using CsPbBr 3 perovskite NCs, in which the reactant molecules dynamically attach to the surfaces of NCs. In general, such photocatalytic C-C coupling reactions proceed through a radical-mediated reaction pathway. 272,279 Furthermore, the photoexcited charge carriers of CsPbBr 3 NCs have also been used to catalyze organic reactions with C-N and C-O bond formations from nonbinding reactant molecules. 270 Interestingly, small molecules that have either sulfur or oxygen or nitrogen atoms can efficiently extract the photoexcited electrons or holes from LHP NCs. 264,286,287 It is most likely that these atoms facilitate the adsorption of the molecules on the surface of LHP NCs. However, in-depth studies are needed to understand the interactions of different molecules on the surface of LHP NCs. Nevertheless, the native ligands (typically OAm and OA) strongly influence the excited-state interactions of LHP NCs with charge acceptor molecules.

Moreover, small structural variations in chiral ligands significantly affect the magnitude and sign of the CD signals, and the study found that dimethylbenzylammonium chiral ligands, along with achiral octylammonium ligands, were found to be efficient in yielding chiral NPLs with relatively high g-factors (Figure 12b). 313 In addition, several attempts were made in inducing the chirality in bulklike LHP nanocubes using chiral ligands. 237,310,316 In this regard, Kim et al. 310 proposed both ligand-controlled synthesis and postsynthetic ligand exchange to obtain chiral FAPbBr 3 NCs using the short chiral ligands (R)-2-octylamine and (S)/(R)-MBA-Br. The anchoring of (R)-2-octylamine to FAPbBr 3 NCs results in chiral perovskite NCs that emit CPL with a relatively high luminescence dissymmetry (g lum ) factor of 6.8 × 10 -2 . However, the chiral FAPbBr 3 NCs obtained by postligand exchange with (S)/(R)-MBA-Br molecules exhibit a g lum of ±1.18 × 10 -2 . The postsynthetic ligand exchange strategy has also been extended to obtain chiral quantum-confined LHP NCs with intense signals in circular dichroism using a variety of chiral ligands. 317 Despite significant progress in chiral LHP NCs, the origin of chirality is still not well understood. Luther and co-workers proposed that the chiral ligands anchored on the surface of LHP NCs induce centro-asymmetric distortion in the surface of the perovskite lattice, thereby leading to a chiroptical response. 318 In addition, it is noteworthy to mention the induced chirality in LHP NCs by self-assembly 291,319,320 or through the surface functionalization of achiral perovskites on chiral helical fibers (Figure 12c,d), the surface chemistry plays an important role. 292,320,321 However, the g-factors reported for LHP NCs are considerably lower than reported for chiral plasmonic NCs. We refer the reader to the previous reviews for extensive information on chiral perovskite thin films and nanocrystals. 296,[322][323][324] ■ SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Over the last 8 years, LHP NCs have emerged at the forefront of colloidal semiconductor nanomaterials for various applications because of their interesting optical and optoelectronic properties. The rapid developments in the field regarding their preparation with controlled dimensions and composition have led to a greater understanding of their properties. They have already shown great promise as efficient light sources for LEDs, lasers, and single photon emission. In addition, they are gaining interest as light-harvesting materials for photocatalysis, as well as NC-based solar cells with improved long-term stability. Despite significant progress in the field, the poor stability of LHPs and their vulnerability toward antisolvent-induced purification is a major obstacle to advancing their applications. The aging of the colloidal NC solution or purification process often leads to the detachment of ligands because of weak ionic ligand-surface interactions. The ligand detachment leads to the formation of surface traps and, thus, significant reduction in PLQY. The surface traps can be passivated and, thus, can recover the photoluminescence by passivation with ligands that bind strongly to the NC surface.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the type of ligands and their interaction with NC surfaces play a crucial role in the stability and PL efficiency of LHP NCs. This review discusses different ligands used for the stability of LHP NCs through in situ synthesis or postsynthetic surface passivation. Such ligands as alkyl quaternary ammonium cations, phosphine oxides, alkyl sulfonyl, thiols, and bidentate (zwitterionic) ligands have been exploited, and their interactions with NC surfaces have been discussed in this review. In particular, alkyl quaternary ammonium and zwitterionic ligands have been proven to be excellent stabilizers of perovskite NCs toward long-term stability and maintaining high PLQY after purification. The ligands not only improve the stability but also induce new properties and functions in LHP NCs, depending on their type. For instance, chiral ligands induce chirality in LHP NCs either by intrinsic structural change or through self-assembly into chiral architectures. Different chiral ligands used to obtain colloidal LHP NCs through different synthesis strategies are discussed and rationalized in this review. In addition, the use of special ligands leads to photoexcited charge/electron transfer from perovskite NCs to nearby molecules that interact with NC surfaces. Such LHP NC-molecular systems have been explored for enhanced photocatalysis and chemical reactions, which are also discussed in this review.Therefore, the type of ligands and their interaction with NC surfaces play a crucial role in the stability and PL efficiency of LHP NCs.

        <p>Despite great progress in exploiting different ligands, there are still several outstanding challenges to be addressed for a better understanding of their interaction with the surface of LHP NCs. It is somewhat clear that the cationic ligands occupy the A cation sites, while the anionic ligands occupy the halide positions on the surface of NCs. However, different studies have proposed different kinds of ligand binding modes to the NC surface. Therefore, advanced characterization methods are needed for an atomic-level understanding of the surface chemistry of LHP NCs. In addition, new types of ligands are needed to be explored for further improvement in the stability of NCs. Especially, multidentate ligands that interact with several binding sites of the NC surface can be promising for strong surface passivation and high density of surface coverage. The ligands reported so far need to be rationalized in order to design new ligands on the basis of the current understanding of the ligand-NC interactions. Special attention needs to be focused on the design of ligands (e.g., conjugated multidentate ligands) that bind to NC surfaces strongly, as well as improve the interparticle charge transport in NC films. Furthermore, despite increasing attention in the preparation of chiral LHP NCs using chiral ligands, they exhibit poor stability and low dissymmetric factors. We think it would be interesting to explore chiral multidentate and polymer ligands in order to improve the long-term stability and dissymmetry factor of chiral LHP NCs. In addition, it is important to understand the chiral ligand stricture and dissymmetric factor of the resulting colloidal NCs in order to design better ligands that induce strong chirality. Finally, there is a plenty of room for enhanced energy/charge transfer for enhanced light harvesting and driving chemical reactions by rationalizing the NC-molecular interactions and through the design of new molecules. We believe this review not only provides insights into ligands that improve colloidal stability but also guides the researcher to design new ligands for inducing new functions for LHP NCs.Despite great progress in exploiting different ligands, there are still several outstanding challenges to be addressed for a better understanding of their interaction with the surface of LHP NCs.
