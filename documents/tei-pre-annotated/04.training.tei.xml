        <p>In mass spectrometry imaging (MS Imaging) a sample of interest is scanned and the resulting ion signals are reconstructed into a pixel image. Several overviews of this method have been published recently [1,2].The application of MS imaging is rapidly growing with a constantly increasing number of different instrumental systems and software tools. This results in a need of exchangeability of MS imaging data between different instruments and data analysis software. As for many analytical methods, data processing has become an essential part of the workflow for MS imaging. MS Imaging data consist of several thousand spectra which frequently result in data files of several gigabytes. Mass spectra of one experiment are usually acquired with identical measurement parameters. Existing standards such as the DICOM standard [3] for in-vivo imaging data or the mzML standard [4] established by HUPO-PSI [5] are not suitable to adequately represent an MS imaging experiment. Therefore a common data format dedicated to mass spectrometry imaging data was developed within the EU project COMPUTIS (www.computis.org). The data format is in part based on the HUPO-PSI format mzML (see details below) and is thus called imzML for 'imaging mzML'.In mass spectrometry imaging (MS Imaging) a sample of interest is scanned and the resulting ion signals are reconstructed into a pixel image.

        <p>This technical report provides an overview of the most important properties and features of the imzML format. Additional information and all technical details necessary to implement imzML is provided on the website www.imzml.org and in a recently published book chapter [6].This technical report provides an overview of the most important properties and features of the imzML format.

        <p>MS imaging data in imzML is divided into two separate files (Figure 1). This structure, consisting of a small file (text or XML) and a larger (binary) file, has been shown to be efficient in previous data formats for MS imaging, for example in BioMap [7] and internal data formats at FOM Institute and Justus Liebig University. All metadata (e.g. instrumental parameters, sample details) are stored in an XML file. Mass spectral data is stored in a binary file to ensure efficient storage. Corresponding XML and binary files contain a universally unique identifier (UUID) [8] in order to link them unequivocally and to prevent loss of information.MS imaging data in imzML is divided into two separate files (Figure 1).

        <p>In order to stay as close as possible to existing formats this metadata file is based on the mass spectrometry data standard mzML [4] developed by HUPO-PSI [9]. Discussions with HUPO-PSI resulted in the strategy to maintain imzML as a separate format, but keep the XML structure consistent with mzML. Information is provided in the form of a 'controlled vocabulary' (CV) which is stored in an open biomedical ontology [10]. This approach is used in order to unequivocally describe the parameters and to avoid redundancy in nomenclature.In order to stay as close as possible to existing formats this metadata file is based on the mass spectrometry data standard mzML [4] developed by HUPO-PSI [9].

        <p>The mzML controlled vocabulary [11] has been supplemented by parameters which are necessary for a comprehensive description of MS imaging experiments. These additional imzML CV parameters (including x/y position, scan direction/pattern, pixel size) are stored in the imagingMS.obo file [12].The mzML controlled vocabulary [11] has been supplemented by parameters which are necessary for a comprehensive description of MS imaging experiments.

        <p>The imaging binary data file (*.ibd) contains the mass spectral data of the MS imaging measurement. In order to ensure efficient storage, two different binary modes are defined: continuous and processed. 'Continuous' means that an intensity value is stored for each m/z bin even if there is no measurable signal (resulting in an intensity of zero). This data structure is used for many MALDI-TOF mass spectrometers. As a result the m/z axis is identical for all mass spectra of one image. Therefore it is sufficient to store the m/z array only once in the binary file. This structure can reduce the file size significantly (up to a factor of 2). On the other hand mass spectra are often processed before they are stored e.g. for noise-reduction, peak-picking, deisotoping. This results in discontinuous and non-constant m/z arrays. In this case the m/z array has to be stored for each spectrum separately. This data structure was termed 'Processed'.The imaging binary data file (*.ibd) contains the mass spectral data of the MS imaging measurement.

        <p>A number of software tools already support 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs>. This allows for choosing from a (growing) number of options to display and process MS imaging data. Users will be no longer limited to proprietary software, but are able to use the processing software best suited for a specific question or application. Multiple software tools can also be combined in one workflow using 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs> as demonstrated in Figure 2. In this example a whole body rat section was coated with α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) and analysed with a QStar mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). Mass spectra were acquired for 344 x 87 pixels (500 µm pixel size) in the mass range m/z = 300-1000 u. Data was saved in the 
            <rs type="software">Analyze</rs>
            <rs type="version">7.5</rs> data format and opened in '
            <rs type="software">BioMap</rs>' for initial inspection (Figure 2A). Subsequently the dataset was converted to imzML using the 'Toimzml' converter developed by the 
            <rs type="creator">CEA-LIST institute</rs>.
        </p>
        <p>The imzML file was opened in '
            <rs type="software">SpectViewer</rs>' (developed by 
            <rs type="creator">CEA-LIST</rs>) and a wavelet denoising procedure was applied in order to improve image quality (Figure 2B). This particular processing function is not available in the other software tools. The processed data was saved in a new imzML file which was subjected to further analysis. This conversion tool has also been used in previous studies in combination with the 
            <rs type="software">Datacube Explorer</rs> for analyzing and displaying MS imaging data [13,14]. More information on sample details, image properties and conversion method are provided in the 'imzML gallery' on 
            <rs type="url">www.imzml.org</rs>. This page also includes additional examples of MS images generated with imzML.
        </p>
        <p>The examples discussed above illustrate the functionalities and possibilities of the imzML data format. A number of additional software tools are currently adopted for usage with 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs>. This includes '
            <rs type="software">MSImageView</rs>' the successor of 
            <rs type="software">BioMap</rs> which is probably the most widely used independent software to analyze MS imaging data. The first two commercial software packages supporting 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs> have been released recently [15,16]. The concept of imzML is also actively supported by major vendors of instrumentation for MS imaging including Waters Corporation (Manchester, United Kingdom), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bremen, Germany) and Bruker Daltonik (Bremen, Germany). Their data formats are integrated in the imzML workflow through export options in proprietary software suites (
            <rs type="software">Waters</rs>) or by external converters being developed by the MS imaging community with technical support from the companies (Thermo, Bruker). An updated list of available tools and workflows can be found on the imzML website. imzML was chosen as the central platform for exchange of data in the European COST network 'Mass Spectrometry Imaging: New Tools for Healthcare Research' which includes more than 30 MS imaging groups [17].
        </p>
        <p>The future development of 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs>-based software will also be coordinated in this framework.
        </p>
        <p>These activities ensure a wide distribution and active development of imzML as the data standard for mass spectrometry imaging data.These activities ensure a wide distribution and active development of imzML as the data standard for mass spectrometry imaging data.</p>
        <p>The data format 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs> enables efficient and flexible exchange of MS imaging data. It allows for a flexible selection of data analysis tools. 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs> is increasingly used in the MS imaging community. A number of software tools are available and many more are currently being adapted to 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs>. A common data format is not a mere technical detail, but has significant impact on practical work: fully searchable mass spectrometry imaging data can be shared with collaborators in biological or clinical labs without being restricted to proprietary vendor software. 
            <rs type="software">imzML</rs> is thus an important step towards more efficient collaboration as well as more flexible and transparent data processing in mass spectrometry imaging. These are key requirements for MS imaging to finally be established as a routine method.
