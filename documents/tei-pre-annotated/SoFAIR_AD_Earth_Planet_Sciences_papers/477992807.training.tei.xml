        <p>There can be no doubt that early land plant evolution transformed the planet but until recently, how and when this was achieved has been unclear. Coincidence in the first appearance of land plant fossils and formative shifts in atmospheric oxygen and CO2 are an artefact of the paucity of earlier terrestrial rocks. Disentangling the timing of land plant body plan assembly and its impact on global biogeochemical cycles has been precluded by uncertainty concerning the relationships of bryophytes to one another and to the tracheophytes, as well as the timescale over which these events unfolded. New genome and transcriptome sequencing projects, combined with the application of sophisticated phylogenomic modelling methods, have yielded increasing support for the Setaphyta clade of liverworts and mosses, within monophyletic bryophytes. We consider the evolution of anatomy, genes, genomes and of development within this phylogenetic context, concluding that many vascular plant (tracheophytes) novelties were already present in a comparatively complex last common ancestor of living land plants (embryophytes). Molecular clock analyses indicate that embryophytes emerged in a mid-Cambrian to early Ordovician interval, compatible with hypotheses on their role as geoengineers, precipitating early Palaeozoic glaciations.There can be no doubt that early land plant evolution transformed the planet but until recently, how and when this was achieved has been unclear.

        <p>There can be no doubt that early land plant evolution transformed the planet, increasing the energy budget 1 , changing atmospheric chemistry 2 and the albedo of the continents 3 , complexifying biogeochemical cycles 2 through fungal symbioses 4 , weathering 5 and modified styles of sedimentation 6 , carbon fixation and storage 7 , and creating habitats for metazoan terrestrialization 8 . However, understanding of the timing and nature of phytoterrestrialization has been complicated by uncertainty concerning the fundamental relationships among embryophytes (land plants), specifically the relationships of three principal lineages of bryophytes to the tracheophytes (vascular plants) which dominate extant land plant diversity (see Box 1: Embryophyte bodyplans). Hornworts, liverworts and mosses comprise the bryophytes, all of which exhibit haploid gametophyte-dominant life cycles, much like the haploiddominant charophyte green algal relatives of land plants. After fertilization, diploid bryophyte sporophytes develop from gametophytes to which they remain attached and from which they are nourished. In contrast, vascular plants have sporophyte-dominant and (at least primitively) independent gametophyte and sporophyte life cycle stages; their monophyly is not contested. Many bryophyte similarities are plesiomorphies inherited from freshwater algal relatives, but some bryophyte lineages exhibit characteristics that are otherwise exclusive to tracheophytes, like stomata, water conducting cells, and leaves. These features have a complex taxonomic distribution that complicates both the possibility of their homology to tracheophyte counterparts, as well as the phylogenetic relationships between bryophytes and tracheophytes. Almost every possible hypothesis for bryophyte relationships to vascular plants has been proposed (Figure 1a-i), from a monophyletic sister-group (Figure 1a), to a paraphyletic array of sister-lineages (Figure 1b-i), with hornworts, liverworts and mosses alternately considered the most distant or closest relative of tracheophytes (Figure 1b-i) 9,10 . Each of these hypotheses implies competing patterns of character gain and loss in the evolutionary assembly of land plant bodyplans. However, the weight of evidence has recently swung towards what might have been perceived as the least likely solution: bryophytes comprise a natural group, sister to the vascular plants. Here we review the evidence for bryophyte monophyly and consider its implications for the evolution of early land plant evolution based on insights from comparative genomics, comparative developmental biology and the fossil record. Drawing this evidence together, we infer the embryophyte ancestor to have been a more complex (more tracheophyte-like) organism and a more capable geoengineer, than has been perceived hitherto.There can be no doubt that early land plant evolution transformed the planet, increasing the energy budget 1 , changing atmospheric chemistry 2 and the albedo of the continents 3 , complexifying biogeochemical cycles 2 through fungal symbioses 4 , weathering 5 and modified styles of sedimentation 6 , carbon fixation and storage 7 , and creating habitats for metazoan terrestrialization 8 .

        <p>Historical heuristic analysis and cladistic analyses of morphology have generally considered bryophytes paraphyletic to vascular plants [11][12][13][14][15][16] . This view was largely corroborated by phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal, plastid and nuclear protein coding genes, but the relative ordering of the relationships of hornworts, liverworts and mosses to the vascular plants has been disputed, usually with either hornworts or liverworts resolved as the earliest branching lineage of land plants, and either hornworts or mosses considered the closest relative of vascular plants (Figure 1b-i) 9,10 . In any of these iterations, the ancestral land plant must have been of bryophytic grade because the immediate branches emerging from it are populated by bryophytes (Figure 1b-i); tracheophytes emerged from within the bryophytes. Thus, the successive bryophyte sister lineages of tracheophytes have been used experimentally to infer the nature of successive ancestors within the assembly of the vascular land plant bodyplan. Perhaps the most widely accepted phylogenetic scenario until very recently has envisaged bryophytes as paraphyletic, with hornworts and/or mosses the closest relative of tracheophytes and liverworts the most distant among land plants e.g. 17 (Figures 1b,d,i). It is in this light that the fossil record has been rationalized 18 , models selected for studying early land plant development, genome composition and physiology 17,19,20 , and the evolutionary assembly of the embryophyte and tracheophyte body plans inferred e.g. 21 . However, support has ebbed away from this phylogenetic hypothesis and, consequently, some of the evolutionary conclusions based upon it. This has occurred principally because of two developments: data availability and the application of more complex phylogenetic models.Historical heuristic analysis and cladistic analyses of morphology have generally considered bryophytes paraphyletic to vascular plants [11][12][13][14][15][16] .

        <p>Molecular phylogenetic studies of land plants have traditionally focussed on obtaining a small number of plastid, mitochondrial and nuclear loci, from the greatest taxonomic diversity e.g. 22 . A shift toward broader genomic sampling began more than a decade ago 23 , but the fundamental shift has been brought about by the 1000 Plants (1KP) initiative 24 which introduced dramatically increased taxonomic breadth and genomic depth of sampling for molecular phylogenetic analysis, principally through transcriptome sequencing, yielding a vast database of nuclear protein coding genes which had featured little in previously molecular phylogenetic studies. More data are obviously welcome, particularly when this included more bryophytes and algal relatives of land plants, which the 1KP initiative delivered in spades. However, increased genomic sampling can simply compound existing biases that mislead phylogenetic inference 25,26 , as well as making it more computationally challenging to address them. These biases include differences in nucleotide and amino acid substitution rates between sites within the genome and between evolutionary lineages, which are not addressed in the homogeneous substitution models conventionally employed in molecular phylogenetics. Such biases have impacted some of the highest profile controversies in phylogenetics, including the relationships among ctenophores and sponges respect the other animals 27 , the fundamental relationships among mammals 28 , and the coherence of some animal supergroups 29 .Molecular phylogenetic studies of land plants have traditionally focussed on obtaining a small number of plastid, mitochondrial and nuclear loci, from the greatest taxonomic diversity e.g. 22 .

        <p>Cox and colleagues 30,31 have shown that support for bryophyte paraphyly in legacy plastid datasets 22,23 is an artefact of among-lineage compositional heterogeneity -biases in the use of related codons by different sites within the genome. Attempts to control for this using a bespoke substitution matrix favour bryophyte monophyly. Use of site-homogeneous models to analyse an initial 1KP dataset of 852 nuclear protein coding genes recovered bryophyte paraphyly, while a coalescent analysis of amino acid gene trees recovered monophyletic bryophytes 32 . These data have been reanalysed using models that address both site-and lineage-specific compositional heterogeneity, using both concatenation (where all genes are analysed together) as well as coalescent (where genes are analysed individually) approaches, inductively seeking optimal trees and deductively exploring the fit of the data to prior competing topologies 10,33 . Puttick and colleagues 10 found unequivocal support for the setaphyte clade of liverworts plus mosses (named for the seta which supports the sporangium in these taxa) and, while the sum of their analyses strongly favoured bryophyte monophyly, they could not formally reject the possibility of hornworts as sister to setaphytes plus tracheophytes 10 . Sousa and colleagues 33 showed that support for bryophyte paraphyly in these data is an artefact of synonymous substitutions and analysis using a lineage-heterogenous compositional model supported bryophyte monophyly. Their analyses of more comprehensive mitochondrial datasets reached similar conclusions 34 , but composition-aware modelling of plastid datasets supports bryophyte monophyly 35 .

        <p>While relationships amongst bryophytes and between bryophytes and tracheophytes will remain the focus of phylogenetic investigation for some time to come, the problem has been addressed by diverse phylogenetic methods applied to datasets that have resolved the long-standing shortfall in the taxonomic and genomic sampling of bryophytes. Phylogenetic studies now commonly recover the setaphyte clade of liverworts and mosses and bryophyte monophyly has become widely accepted as the conventional working hypothesis for elucidating the nature of early land plants and the evolutionary assembly of their bodyplans and genomes.While relationships amongst bryophytes and between bryophytes and tracheophytes will remain the focus of phylogenetic investigation for some time to come, the problem has been addressed by diverse phylogenetic methods applied to datasets that have resolved the long-standing shortfall in the taxonomic and genomic sampling of bryophytes.

        <p>While our understanding of bryophyte relationships has been in a state of flux through this period, the monophyly of tracheophytes has remained uncontentious, with lycophytes (clubmosses, spikemosses, quillworts and scale trees) resolved as sister to the euphyllophyte clade of monilophytes (ferns and horsetails) and spermatophytes (seed plants including gymnosperms and angiosperms). Meanwhile, hypotheses on the phylogenetic relationships among land plant relatives have proven more contentious (Figure 2). Chara and Colechaete (Charophyceae and Coleochaetophyceae in Figure 2) have long featured in scenarios for the origin of land plants e.g. 38 because they exhibit a number of land plant characteristics (branching, tissues, cell walls with plasmodesmata, apical meristems, asymmetric cell division and zygotes that produce sporopollenin) and many phylogenetic studies have recovered them as sister to embryophytes (Figure 2A-C). However, most recent molecular phylogenetic analyses identify the aflagellate, conjugating and largely unicellular Zygnematophyceae (though some forms are colonial, filamentous and exhibit branching 39 ) as the immediate sister-lineage to embryophytes 23,37,[40][41][42] (Figure 2D).While our understanding of bryophyte relationships has been in a state of flux through this period, the monophyly of tracheophytes has remained uncontentious, with lycophytes (clubmosses, spikemosses, quillworts and scale trees) resolved as sister to the euphyllophyte clade of monilophytes (ferns and horsetails) and spermatophytes (seed plants including gymnosperms and angiosperms).

        <p>The new genomic resources delivered by a revolution in genome sequencing technologies has not only led to a revised understanding of land plant phylogeny, but also fundamental new insights into the evolution of land plant genomes. More than anything, comparative genomics has revealed that the genes associated with many of the key anatomical and physiological traits of land plants, have a much more ancient evolutionary origin. The origin of land plants is as much associated with gene co-option, exaptation and even horizontal gene transfer, as it is with fundamental innovation.The new genomic resources delivered by a revolution in genome sequencing technologies has not only led to a revised understanding of land plant phylogeny, but also fundamental new insights into the evolution of land plant genomes.

        <p>Chromosome-level events (e.g., whole genome duplications, emergence of epigenetic mechanisms) have surely been influential in early land plant evolution, but their study is complicated by the plasticity of plant genomes (e.g., hybridisation, polyploidy, dysploidy) and the poor contiguity of the genomes currently available for species that phylogenetically bracket major evolutionary transitions. Consequently, focus has shifted towards tracing the evolution of gene complements, including well-studied candidate genes whose roles are known to be influential in the development of key innovations, but also in the discovery of new genes using comparative genomics. Bowles and colleagues 43 undertook a forensic comparative analysis of genomes from over 200 eukaryotic, including 158 land plant species, focussed on dissecting the evolutionary assembly of plant genomes. These analyses show unprecedented levels of gene novelty associated with two critical branches in plant phylogeny, reflecting the origin of streptophytes and of land plants. This is especially remarkable in the case of novel core gene families, clade-specific genes present in most taxa and, thus, inferred to be biologically important. A similar burst of new genes occurred at the origin of animals 44 , but plants exhibit 2-4 times more core gene novelties. It is possible to approximate the role that these novel genes performed in ancient ancestors based on their function in extant model organisms like the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These functions can (and usually will) have evolved over the evolutionary distance between living species (whose genomes were investigated) at the tips of the phylogenetic tree and the ancient ancestors (represented by nodes in the tree) in which the genes are inferred to have originated 45 . However, hypotheses on the ancestral roles of genes from derived model organisms like A. thaliana are open to testing through reverse genetics in extant lineages that bracket evolutionary transitions. For example, commonality of gene function in bryophytes and tracheophytes that is different to orthologous gene function in zygnematophytes and coleochaetophytes, would indicate gain of function in the embryophyte stem-lineage.Chromosome-level events (e.g., whole genome duplications, emergence of epigenetic mechanisms) have surely been influential in early land plant evolution, but their study is complicated by the plasticity of plant genomes (e.g., hybridisation, polyploidy, dysploidy) and the poor contiguity of the genomes currently available for species that phylogenetically bracket major evolutionary transitions.

        <p>In the ancestor of streptophytes, a large proportion of the genetic novelties are transcription factors, genes involved in gene regulation and usually linked with the emergence of cell types in multicellular organisms 43 . In the branch leading to land plants, most of the novel core genes are involved in functions typically related to terrestrial environments, such as UV light protection, root development, interactions between plants and microbes, tolerance to drought, and phytohormones involved in response to land stressors. Other recent studies expanding the sampling of charophytes has also shown that transcription factors, phytohormones, and genes involved in adaptations to life in land (e.g. drought resistance), emerged in the origin of embryophytes [46][47][48] . Other remarkable land plant novelties include genes like MYB class genes or CYP77A (cuticle biosynthesis) 49 , as well as CLAVATA (3D growth) 50 .In the ancestor of streptophytes, a large proportion of the genetic novelties are transcription factors, genes involved in gene regulation and usually linked with the emergence of cell types in multicellular organisms 43 .

        <p>One example are However, genomic novelty is not the only process involved in these transitions. Some candidate genes evolved before the phenotypic novelty with which are causally implicated, reflecting gene co-option. For example, genes involved in multicellular development, embryonic morphogenesis, roots, trichomes, seeds, flowers, or lateral organs predate the emergence of their respective anatomical novelties 43 . PIN auxin transporters or DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1), genes involved in 3D growth evolved in streptophyte algae 51,52 . Transcription factors from gene regulatory networks involved in differentiation of land plant structures have been shown to have already emerged in streptophyte algae and have been retained throughout land plants 53 . For example, Class I and II KNOX genes, homeobox transcription factors central to land plant development, arose through duplication of a single ancestral orthologue, prior to the origin of the Phragmoplastophyta clade 54 .One example are However, genomic novelty is not the only process involved in these transitions.

The first genome of a moss revealed HGT from bacteria, fungi, and viruses of genes involved in xylem formation, plant defence, or metabolism 56 . A new analysis of genomes of zygnematophyceaen algae shows that stress-response genes GRAS and PYL might have been incorporated by transfer from soil bacteria to the ancestor of these algae and land plants 57 . Similarly, Bowles et al 43 found 323 gene families potentially shared only between fungi and land plants related to gene regulation and protein modification.

        <p>Gene gains by duplication or whole genome duplication, exaptation of older genes, and HGT, all contributed to shaping the genome of early land plants. Some of the mechanisms underlying these processes are not well understood and require further investigation. Genome reduction, in particular, has been implicated as major evolutionary force shaping genomes 59 and shown to be influential in animal genome evolution 60,61 . However, though it has clearly played a role in Zygnematophyceae 57,62 the role of gene loss in land plant evolution has yet to be the subject of systematic investigation.Gene gains by duplication or whole genome duplication, exaptation of older genes, and HGT, all contributed to shaping the genome of early land plants.

        <p>The evolutionary implications of comparative developmental genetic studies are contingent on the phylogenetic framework within which they are considered. Since the engineering of moss 63 , liverwort 64 and now even hornwort 65 developmental models, it is no longer necessary to rely on one or other as a proxy for the embryophyte ancestor, which is reassuring since each is a chimaera of ancestral and derived characteristics. However, by marshalling insights from all of these lineages, in comparison to tracheophytes and algal relatives, it is possible to leverage insights into the developmental biology of embryophyte, tracheophyte and bryophyte ancestors and the developmental evolution of their bodyplans. Here we consider fundamental insights that comparative developmental genetics has on the homology and evolution of the key phenotypic novelties of land plants.The evolutionary implications of comparative developmental genetic studies are contingent on the phylogenetic framework within which they are considered.

        <p>Cuticle and stomata: Dehydration due to evaporative water loss and UV irradiation would have been among the most proximal of environmental challenges faced by plants on land, and the innovation of the waxy cuticle in the last shared common ancestor of land plants conferred protection 66 .

        <p>Land plants also gained capacity to rotate cell divisions through multiple planes during apical growth 70 , which enabled volumetric space occupation (3D growth). The algal sister lineages to land plants lack this capacity and are constrained to mat-like or filamentous growth habits 47,71 . The evolutionary innovation of 3D growth is recapitulated by developmental transitions in bryophytes, and mosses in particular undergo a protracted filamentous 2D growth phase prior to the onset of 3D growth in the gametophyte stage of the life cycle 72 .

        <p>The initials of bryophyte gametophytes either generate leafy gametophores (mosses and leafy liverworts) or thalli (thalloid liverworts and hornworts), and although these serve the ultimate purpose of gamete production, they have widely divergent morphologies and can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (having male and female plants). Diversity among bryophytes points to convergent evolution of indeterminate leafy and branching forms in gametophytes and sporophytes. While some of the genetic mechanisms regulating these traits have been independently recruited to regulate gametophyte and sporophyte development (e.g. PIN-and CLV-regulation of apical function 50,76 , HD-Zip-regulation of leaf development 82 ) other genetic solutions to morphological innovations are distinct (e.g. divergent auxin transport mechanisms in the regulation of gametophyte and sporophyte branching in a moss 83 ). The independent evolution of multicellularity in the haploid gametophyte stage of the life cycle and the diploid sporophyte stage of the life cycle of land plants offers opportunities to determine the genetic basis of convergent evolution.The initials of bryophyte gametophytes either generate leafy gametophores (mosses and leafy liverworts) or thalli (thalloid liverworts and hornworts), and although these serve the ultimate purpose of gamete production, they have widely divergent morphologies and can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (having male and female plants).

        <p>While the algal relatives of land plants have diverse gametophyte morphologies, fertilisation is followed rapidly and uniformly by meiosis 84 . Land plant life cycles are characterised by delayed meiosis, with a period of embryonic growth prior to sporangium development in bryophytes or vegetative development in vascular plants 85- 87 . While bryophyte sporophytes usually have a single growth axis, perturbation of polar auxin transport or TCP transcription factor function in mosses can induce branching, potentially by an early and equal division of the apical cell or respecification of epidermal cells as apical cells 76,[87][88][89] , and the innovation of bifurcation may have boosted spore production. A nascent capacity for vegetative growth is indicated by KNOX promotion of proliferation and elongation from an intercalary region in moss sporophyte axes 90,91 , and the conservation of KNOX function in promoting apical proliferation among vascular plants with indeterminate shoot growth [92][93][94][95][96] .

        <p>In vascular plant shoot apices, stem cells and proliferative zones marked by KNOX activity are juxtaposed, and the displacement of sporangia away from the shoot tips may have enabled the innovation of indeterminate shoot growth 86 . In contrast to the innovation of indeterminacy, sporophyte leaves arose many times convergently by modification of branching shoot systems in different parts of the land plant phylogeny 98 . The cellular and developmental processes involved in leaf morphogenesis in different lineages are not fully clear. Lycophyte leaves are thought to have arisen by enation (epidermal outgrowth) 99,100 or the reduction of lateral branches bearing sporangia (sterilisation) 101 and fern frond initials arise from the apical epidermis 102,103 , but pools of cells from the shoot apical meristem are recruited into seed plant leaf development 104 . The extent of conservation in pathways for leaf development amongst vascular plants is currently unclear but expression analyses indicate that roles for HD-Zip genes in leaf initiation and leaf patterning are conserved within seed plants, but not to lycophytes [105][106][107] , and roles for KANADI transcription factors in specifying the abaxial leaf domain are conserved to the level of euphyllophytes 108 .

        <p>Vascular and supporting tissues: Shoot growth necessitated the evolution of transport mechanisms, and it is generally accepted that vascular and supporting tissues evolved with tracheophytes, and tracheids with annual-helical thickenings are a synapomorphy of tracheophytes.

Xu and colleagues 112 have shown that VNS transcription factors, which are functionally implicated in xylem, phloem and secondary wall thickening in Arabidopsis, are functionally implicated in moss hydroid and stereid development, influencing water conductance, hydroid cell maturation, secondary wall thickening and apoptosis.

        <p>The oldest possible fossil evidence for land plants occurs as late Cambrian cryptospores [128][129][130][131][132] , but their irregular arrangements and occurrence in 'packets' of multiple spore-like bodies surrounded by synoecosporal walls 131 has led to algal interpretations 132,133 . The oldest unequivocal evidence for the divergence of the embryophyte lineage from algal relatives is also based on cryptospores, but these occur in regular fused geometric arrangements of dyads and tetrads of middle Ordovician (≥469 Ma) age (Figure 3A-D). These are accepted as embryophytes based on similarity to permanent tetrads and dyads produced by living bryophytes [134][135][136] , though it is unclear whether these earliest records are stem-or crown-embryophytes (see Box 2 for an explanation of crown-, stem-and total-group classification). Younger records occur within fossil sporangia on bifurcating axes 137 , perhaps representing stem-tracheophytes. The earliest unequivocal evidence for the divergence of tracheophytes and bryophytes can be constrained by a middle Silurian (≥429.3 Ma) record of Cooksonia 138 that is known from younger anatomically preserved specimens of sporophytes bearing terminal sporangia (Figure 3E-F) containing spores (Figure 3G), on branching axes (Figure 3E) containing tracheids (Figure 3H), sterome and bearing stomata (Figure 3I) 139,140 . More derived stem-tracheophytes like Rhynia (Figure 3J-K) and Horneophyton (Figure 3L-M), as well as early crown-tracheophytes possessed bryophyte-like rhizoid anchoring systems, while true roots with gravitropism, a root cap and root hairs are features seen only in derived lycophytes and euphyllophytes 141,142 . The earliest evidence for the tracheophyte crowngroup is late Silurian (≥420.7 Ma) based on zosterophylls 143 , which preserve evidence of lateral insertion of reniform sporangia along stems, which dehisce along their distal margins into two valves, substantiating an affinity with lycophytes 12 .

        <p>The traditional land plant phylogeny, in which liverworts were considered sister to all other bryophytes and tracheophytes, led to the reconstruction of a fairly simple, gametophytedominant ancestral embryophyte, missing traits that have been considered integral to the biogeochemical impact, as well as the evolutionary and ecological success of extant land plants. These include absence of stomata, rooting systems, dichotomous branching, upright axes, leaves, dehiscent spores, etc. In large part, this is because liverworts lack many of these characters e.g. 21 and because our developmental and genome model taxa are often interpreted too literally, as model proxies for ancestral organisms 10 . Rather, insights should be sought from comparative analysis of lineages that phylogenetically bracket evolutionary phenomena, allowing us to indirectly infer the nature of ancestral organisms 45 , drawing on evidence, as we have, from the comparative anatomy of living and fossil species, as well as comparative developmental genetics.The traditional land plant phylogeny, in which liverworts were considered sister to all other bryophytes and tracheophytes, led to the reconstruction of a fairly simple, gametophytedominant ancestral embryophyte, missing traits that have been considered integral to the biogeochemical impact, as well as the evolutionary and ecological success of extant land plants.

        <p>Bryophyte monophyly and, in particular, the setaphyte clade of liverworts and mosses, helps to resolve some of these uncertainties, leading to the conclusion that key embryophyte characteristics are missing through loss from liverworts 10 . Stomata are present in mosses, hornworts and tracheophytes and, hence, following phylogenetic reasoning, they must have been lost within the lineage leading to extant liverworts after divergence from the moss lineage 10 . It remains possible that stomata have evolved independently in mosses and hornworts, separately from tracheophytes, since they exhibit a patchy phylogenetic distribution in bryophyte lineages where they appear to function differently 21 . However, Harris and colleagues 37 have demonstrated that key components of the gene regulatory network underpinning tracheophyte stomatal development are present in mosses and hornworts, corroborating their homology and indicating that they were present in the ancestral embryophyte. Similarly, extant bryophytes do not exhibit dichotomous branching and so this trait has been conventionally interpreted as a tracheophyte innovation e.g. 18 . However, as we have seen, dichotomous branching can be induced experimentally 76,88,89 . Given the shared mechanistic basis of branching in mosses and tracheophytes, it is likely that the ancestral embryophyte was also capable of dichotomous axial branching. The fossil record demonstrates that the rhizoid-based anchoring systems of living charophyaceaen algae and bryophytes were a feature not only the ancestral embryophyte, but of the ancestral tracheophyte as well; true roots with gravitropism, a root cap and root hairs are features seen only in derived lycophytes and euphyllophytes 141,142 .Bryophyte monophyly and, in particular, the setaphyte clade of liverworts and mosses, helps to resolve some of these uncertainties, leading to the conclusion that key embryophyte characteristics are missing through loss from liverworts 10 .

        <p>It is also possible that even vascular tissues are a shared primitive feature of land plants, rather than a derived characteristic of vascular plants. Scheirer 109 drew comparison between moss leptoids and phloem-like sieve elements, moss hydroids and xylem-like tracheids, arguing for their homology. Ligrone and colleagues 21,111 have been influential in interpreting the detailed similarities identified by Scheirer 109 as resulting from convergent evolution, principally on the basis of their sporadic distribution among mosses, and of water conducting cells among bryophytes more generally. However, as we have seen, there is now convincing evidence for homology of the vascular system in mosses and tracheophytes 112 and, within the framework of bryophyte monophyly, for the presence of a vascular system in the ancestral land plant. Scheirer 109 and Mishler and Churchill 11 drew the distinction that the secondary annular and spiral thickenings of tracheids are a derived feature of tracheophytes, absent from a vascularised ancestral embryophyte. This conclusion no longer follows if bryophytes and tracheophytes are sister clades since the condition in the ancestral embryophyte is rendered uncertain. The available evidence is compatible both with (i) tracheids as a synapomorphy of tracheophytes and (ii) tracheids were present in the ancestral embryophyte but lost in the bryophyte stem-lineage. However, Scheirer's argument remains persuasive, that were tracheids an embryophyte plesiomorphy, vestigial tracheids should be anticipated in extant bryophytes 109 , just as stomata exhibit a sporadic phylogenetic distribution among hornworts and mosses.

        <p>Consequently, the ancestral land plant must have been more complex and tracheophyte-like than has been perceived hitherto, since we can infer that comparatively few phenotypic characters distinguish the respective ancestors of the tracheophyte and embryophyte clades (Figure 4). At the same time, identification of Zygnematophyceae as sister to Embryophyta might imply that (i) many of the embryophyte-like characteristics of Charophyceae and Coleochaetophyceae are the consequence of convergent evolution, and (ii) embryophytes evolved from much simpler pond scum, exemplified by their zygnematophyceaen kin. Inevitably, the truth is more complicated and there is evidence for both convergence on complex body plans among Charophyceae and Embryophyta, and simplification in Zygnematophyceae 43,47,62 . Nevertheless, the gulf in anatomical complexity between the first and last embryophyte common ancestors is doubtless greater than those bridged by conventional scenarios that envisaged Coleochaetophyceae as protoembryophytes e.g. 38 . Our review of comparative genomics demonstrates that some key adaptations to life on land have a deep evolutionary origin among green algae, such as the emergence of genes for traits generally considered distinctly land plant specific, including cell wall biosynthesis 146 , hormones, signalling pathways elements, as well as drought and light related stress response factors 57,147 . No doubt these traits evolved within freshwater green algae because they were episodically confronted by the same environmental challenges as later land plants. However, the embryophyte stem-lineage coincides with the origin of large numbers of novel genes associated with land plant traits 43 , insights into which we otherwise have no recourse but to the fossil record.Consequently, the ancestral land plant must have been more complex and tracheophyte-like than has been perceived hitherto, since we can infer that comparatively few phenotypic characters distinguish the respective ancestors of the tracheophyte and embryophyte clades (Figure 4). At the same time, identification of Zygnematophyceae as sister to Embryophyta might imply that (i) many of the embryophyte-like characteristics of Charophyceae and Coleochaetophyceae are the consequence of convergent evolution, and (ii) embryophytes evolved from much simpler pond scum, exemplified by their zygnematophyceaen kin. Inevitably, the truth is more complicated and there is evidence for both convergence on complex body plans among Charophyceae and Embryophyta, and simplification in Zygnematophyceae 43,47,62 . Nevertheless, the gulf in anatomical complexity between the first and last embryophyte common ancestors is doubtless greater than those bridged by conventional scenarios that envisaged Coleochaetophyceae as protoembryophytes e.g. 38 .

        <p>We should anticipate that the fossil record underestimates the true age of their clades because lineage divergences are initially genetic phenomena and evidence of occurrence cannot be diagnosed in the fossil record until fossilizable features evolve within derivative lineages 148 . This problem is accentuated by a dearth of early Palaeozoic terrestrial rock sequences and when terrestrial strata become prevalent, from the middle to late Silurian, the preserve evidence of terrestrial plant and animals that are already differentiated and organised into ecosystems 8,149,150 . There can be no fossil record without a rock record in which to entomb it and the paucity of early Palaeozoic terrestrial strata has the effect of telescoping the earliest fossil records of land plant lineages 144 , an interpretation corroborated by Ordovician records of terrestrial spores within marine strata, tens of millions of years older than the earliest records of land plants in terrestrial sequences 151 . Land plants have undoubtedly impacted on the sedimentary rock record principally as a consequence of the evolution of rooting systems that prevent erosion and promote deposition of fine sediment 6,152,153 . This shift coincides with the earliest fossil records of embryophytes and this has been marshalled in support of a literal interpretation of the fossil record 154 . However, as we have seen, rooting systems are a derived characteristic of tracheophytes, evolving convergently in lycophytes and euphyllophytes; even early crowntracheophytes possessed simple rhizoids like those of their bryophyte and algal relatives 142,155,156 and these are not envisaged to have had any impact on sedimentary systems. Consequently, there is a mismatch between the Devonian origin of rooting systems and Ordovician sedimentary phenomena that their evolution is envisaged to have effected.We should anticipate that the fossil record underestimates the true age of their clades because lineage divergences are initially genetic phenomena and evidence of occurrence cannot be diagnosed in the fossil record until fossilizable features evolve within derivative lineages 148 .

        <p>Therefore, in the absence of a literal record of plant evolution to read, there is no recourse to methods that might help to interpret the imperfect archive of evolutionary history that the fossil record represents. While molecular clock methods have been widely employed in plant science, there have been surprisingly few attempts to date the deep divergences within land plants until recently [157][158][159][160][161][162][163][164] and these differ as much in methods as in the estimates that they derive. Most of the earlier clock studies include just moss as a representative bryophyte, and so assuming bryophyte monophyly, they effectively date the ancestral embryophyte node. To be clear, these estimates are agnostic to the true divergence time within their range, allowing for close to poor approximations of the calibrating fossil evidence. The differences among them reflect differences in the interpretation of the fossil record and the prior views on how the fossil evidence approximates the ages of clades 165,166 . Crucial to constraining the timing of divergence of land plants is the near-indestructability of sporopollenin spore walls and their accumulation in marine sediments, transported from the land. Proterozoic and early Phanerozoic marine sequences have been extensively sampled for algal cysts used in biostratigraphy and nothing resembling a land plant spore has been recovered from sediments prior to the Middle Cambrian. The preservation of algal cysts in older strata serves as a taphonomic control, demonstrating that were land plants present, their spores would be preserved and, thus, their absence constitutes evidence that embryophytes were not present at this time 163,166,167 . Given the temporal proximity of fossil constraints on the age of tracheophytes, this provides for a very informative calibration. Recent studies 165,168 that have eschewed this calibration recover deep Proterozoic estimates for the origin of crown-embryophytes and even crown-tracheophytes, like those of early strict clock studies 157,158 ; these timescales can be readily rejected based on the available palaeontological and geological evidence. However, analyses in which these calibrations are employed estimate embryophytes to have diverged from Zygnematophyceae in a late Tonian to middle Cambrian interval, bryophyte-tracheophyte divergence (crown-Embryophyta) in the interval 514.8-473.5 Ma, hornwort-setaphyte (crown-Bryophyta) in the interval 506.4-460.3 Ma and lycophyteeuphyllophyte (crown-Tracheophyta) in the interval 450.8-431.2 Ma 163 .Therefore, in the absence of a literal record of plant evolution to read, there is no recourse to methods that might help to interpret the imperfect archive of evolutionary history that the fossil record represents.

        <p>The successful colonization of the challenging terrestrial environments by the ancestors of land plants has been arguably made available by partnership with fungi. Plant-fungal associations recruited fungal partners mainly from two lineages namely the Glomeromycota-a lineage of fungi well known for their contribution to mycorrhizae in many vascular plants -and Mucoromycotina. Evidence for plant-fungal partnerships have been documented in the earliest land plant record such as the Rhynie Chert 169 and the widespread occurrence in most ancient plant lineages especially hornworts, liverworts, and basal vascular plant lineages such as homosporous lycophytes and ferns suggest the formation of this partnership dating back to the common ancestors of all land plants 170 . However, not all lineages maintained these partnerships as illustrated by the absence of fungal association in the majority of mosses 170 . Whereas the fungal-partnerships in the roots of vascular plants and the autotrophic gametophytes of vascular plants have been well characterized, the rapidly expansion of the documented diversity of fungal-plant partnerships raises core questions about the kind of interactions between these partners during the early divergence of land plants. Understanding these early partnerships will be arguably crucial to reconstruct the greening of land.The successful colonization of the challenging terrestrial environments by the ancestors of land plants has been arguably made available by partnership with fungi.

        <p>While it is widely appreciated that the evolution of land plants has had a transformative impact on the Earth system, the inception of this role has been unclear due to a combination of uncertainties concerning the timing of origin of both land plant lineages and the key novelties that impact on the Earth system. The origin of trees and their complex and deep rooting systems in the Devonian, for example, is implicated in CO2 draw down through silicate weathering resulting in middle Palaeozoic glaciation 171 , but a role for plants as geoengineers prior to this time is often dismissed e.g. because early land plants are perceived to have had a negligible weathering effect and because their biomass is thought to be limited due to desiccation intolerance 3 . However, mosses with vascular systems, which might serve as a model for ancestral embryophytes, demonstrate impressive resistance to dehydration 172 and they have been demonstrated to enhance silicate weathering within a factor of that seen in vascular plants 173 . Biogeochemical modelling which assumes an early Ordovician (490 Ma) origin of land plants compatible with molecular timescales 163 exhibiting moss-like silicate weathering rates and 15% of current landscape vegetation, can explain the otherwise paradoxical end-Ordovician glaciations. These took place after a period of elevated atmospheric CO2 (14-22 times current levels) and high global temperatures 174 , but the impact of the bryophyte-like physiology assumed for early land plants is sufficient to replicate the geochemical record of reducing global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels sufficiently low for glaciation 173 . Modelling has also causally implicated this early rise of land plants in the establishment of modern levels of atmospheric O2 levels, principally through increased flux through silicate weathering of phosphorous to the oceans. This resulted in marine anoxia and organic carbon burial on geologic timescales in the form of the black shales that dominate middle and upper Ordovician strata 2 .While it is widely appreciated that the evolution of land plants has had a transformative impact on the Earth system, the inception of this role has been unclear due to a combination of uncertainties concerning the timing of origin of both land plant lineages and the key novelties that impact on the Earth system.

        <p>The revised understanding of land plant relationships allows for a more tracheophyte-like ancestral embryophyte, as well as the contemporaneous existence of both stem-bryophytes and -tracheophytes. It would be interesting to explore the impact of these traits on the model which assumed a moss-like ancestral embryophyte; analyses using a liverwort proxy-ancestor have contested the geoengineering capabilities of the earliest land plants 175 . In ther intterim, existing sensitivity tests 173 imply that a more tracheophyte-like ancestral land plant would result in the same or greater effect as a moss-proxy, but with lower vegetation cover and/or an even later origin of crown-embryophytes. Conversely, new insights into the evolution of rooting systems 155 imply that the impact of crown-tracheophytes on the Earth system would not have had as great as previously envisaged, at least not in terms of the origin of the clade itself. This is because the earliest crown-tracheophytes retained the same rhizoid based rooting systems inherited from the ancestral embryophyte; branching rooting systems did not evolved until later, independently within lycophytes and euphyllophytes 155 and it is this phenomenon that is manifest in the fossil and geochemical records 3 . It should not be surprising, therefore, that there is a temporal disconnect both in terms of the appearance of the first tracheophytes and their impact on the Earth system, whether that is read in terms of the fossil record or molecular timescales.The revised understanding of land plant relationships allows for a more tracheophyte-like ancestral embryophyte, as well as the contemporaneous existence of both stem-bryophytes and -tracheophytes.

        <p>Recent advances in the availability of genome scale data from a more representative taxonomic diversity of embryophytes, as well as improved phylogenetic modelling, analyses of developmental evolution and the fossil record, have precipitated a minor revolution in our understanding of early land plant evolution. It has helped to resolve some long-standing uncertainties in our understanding of land plant body plan evolution, but also introduce new uncertainties, such as the question of whether the ancestral embryophyte was gametophyte-or sporophyte-dominant or, indeed, whether it was isomorphic. Here a fossil record of stemembryophytes, -bryophytes and -tracheophytes would help but, first, more credible attempts are needed to reconcile the fossil record with molecular phylogenies of their living relatives. That is going to require a better understanding of anatomical evolution among living embryophytes and those data are now perhaps harder to assemble, due to a dearth of specialists, than are genome scale datasets for the most obscure of bryophytes. Nevertheless, a framework of anatomical evolution is integral to elucidating the evolutionary significance of the fossil early land plants exquisitely preserved to a cellular level of resolution through charcoalification 176 and silicification 169 , and new technologies are required to fully characterise these fossils. Ultimately, however, it could be argued that our understanding of the early land plant evolution effectively starts at the end of the story, with the embryophyte crown-ancestor from which bryophytes and tracheophytes emerged. Perhaps the most fundamental insights into the origin of land plants are to be leveraged from genomic and developmental analyses of their algal relatives as well the identification of fossil stem-embryophytes -some of which may already lie in existing collections, awaiting the correct search image for their discovery.Recent advances in the availability of genome scale data from a more representative taxonomic diversity of embryophytes, as well as improved phylogenetic modelling, analyses of developmental evolution and the fossil record, have precipitated a minor revolution in our understanding of early land plant evolution.

        <p>The four principal lineages of living land plants are the hornworts, liverworts, mosses and the vascular plants. While the bryophytes are superficially more similar to one another than to the vascular plants, this is a largely because of their shared primitive characteristics. Here we outline the principal characteristics of their bodyplans. Mosses (Bryopsida: Box 1, Figure 1C): Dominant gametophyte with dependent sporophyte, homosporous. Sporophyte unbranched but differentiated into a seta and a single terminal sporangium capsule; stomata present occur only in the sporophyte. Gametophyte usually differentiated into elongated shoots with leaves usually in spiral arrangements. Simple rhizoid rooting system. Where present, conducting tissues occur in both the gametophyte and sporophyte. In some species, the shoots contain differentiated water conducting cells.

        <p>In considering the fossil record of early land plant evolution it is important to consider the different ways in which fossil species are integrated into phylogenies of living species. In modern systematics, traditional groupings are defined as crown-groups on the basis of their living membership. The tracheophyte crown-group is therefore defined in relation to its two fundamental living lineages, lycophytes and euphyllophytes (ferns and seed plants), their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants, living or extinct (Box 2, Figure 1). Thus, we can identify fossil tracheophytes as members of this crown clade, but we can also recognise fossil species that are more closely related to the tracheophyte crown than they are to the nearest living sister group, the bryophytes. These fossils are not crown-tracheophytes because, even allowing for the vagaries of fossilization, they do not possess all of the phenotypic traits associated with the crown-group. Instead, they are classified as stem-tracheophytes; members of the lineage leading to crown-tracheophytes after it separated from the bryophyte lineage (Box 2, Figure 1). The stem-and crown-groups collectively comprise the tracheophyte total-group and sometimes fossil species are simply referred to the total-group if it is not possible to discriminate between stem-and crown-group classification, usually because the fossil species is too incompletely preserved. The distinctions between stem-, crown-and total-group classifications of fossil species are important because they have differing implications, e.g., for how the fossils inform on the minimum age of the clade; crown-group fossils can provide a minimum age for the living (crown) clade but stem-and total-group fossils can only inform on the age of the totalgroup. The correct ordering of fossils species within the stem-lineage is also helpful in that it is based on the hierarchical nested sets of crown-groups characters that the fossils exhibit and, therefore, the order in which these characters evolved. All fossils belong to a stem-group, the extinct lineage that separates a living clade from its sibling. Crown-clades are defined relative to the last common ancestor of their living members, including all of its descendants, while stem-groups are paraphyletic assemblages of wholly extinct species, more closely to one crown-group than another. A crown-group and its respective stem-group comprise a total-group. The figure shows how some of the fossil species mentioned in the text are related to crown-clades. For example, Zosterophyllum is an extinct genus of crowntracheophytes but stem-lycophytes, while Horneophyton is an extinct genus of crownembryophytes but stem-tracheophytes.In considering the fossil record of early land plant evolution it is important to consider the different ways in which fossil species are integrated into phylogenies of living species. In modern systematics, traditional groupings are defined as crown-groups on the basis of their living membership. The tracheophyte crown-group is therefore defined in relation to its two fundamental living lineages, lycophytes and euphyllophytes (ferns and seed plants), their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants, living or extinct (Box 2, Figure 1). Thus, we can identify fossil tracheophytes as members of this crown clade, but we can also recognise fossil species that are more closely related to the tracheophyte crown than they are to the nearest living sister group, the bryophytes. These fossils are not crown-tracheophytes because, even allowing for the vagaries of fossilization, they do not possess all of the phenotypic traits associated with the crown-group. Instead, they are classified as stem-tracheophytes; members of the lineage leading to crown-tracheophytes after it separated from the bryophyte lineage (Box 2, Figure 1).
