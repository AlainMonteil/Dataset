        <p>. Extant ape features also include enhanced joint mobilitiy, long forelimbs relative to hindlimbs, and (except gorillas) long hands with high-to-very-high finger curvature (8)(9)(10). The orthograde body plan is generally interpreted as a suspensory adaptation (11,12), or as an adaptation for vertical climbing subsequently co-opted for suspension (13)..

        <p>Based on similarities between chimpanzees and gorillas, a prevalent evolutionary model argues that African apes represent "living fossils" and that knuckle-walking chimpanzees closely reflect the morphology and behavior of the Pan-Homo LCA-the "starting point" of human evolution (14,15). This working paradigm also postulates that modern African apes occupy the same habitats as their ancestors (16) (Fig. 1). This assumption is based on a classical scenario that situates hominin origins in East Africa, due to environmental changes following the rifting of East African Rift Valley during the Miocene (17). For some, a chimpanzee-like Pan-Homo LCA could imply also that all extant ape locomotor adaptations were inherited from a modern ape-like ancestor (18). However, the fossil record denotes a more complex picture: Miocene apes often display mosaic morphologies, and even those interpreted as crown hominoids do not exhibit all the features present in living apes (19) (Fig. 3).Based on similarities between chimpanzees and gorillas, a prevalent evolutionary model argues that African apes represent "living fossils" and that knuckle-walking chimpanzees closely reflect the morphology and behavior of the Pan-Homo LCA-the "starting point" of human evolution (14,15).

        <p>The Pan-like LCA model builds on the "East side story" of hominin origins (17), a seriouslychallenged scenario. First, it is grounded in the living ape geographic distribution, which may not match that at the time of the Pan-Homo split (Fig. 1). Second, the model relies on an outdated account of the fossil record (from the 1980s), when the earliest known hominin (Australopithecus afarensis) was recorded in East Africa, and no possible fossil gorillas and chimpanzees were known (17). Subsequent fossil discoveries are incompatible with such a narrative: Australopithecus remains from Chad indicate that early hominins were living ~2,500 kilometers west of the Rift ~3.5 Ma (20). Furthermore, if Sahelanthropus is a hominin, it would push back the human lineage presence in northcentral Africa to ~7 Ma (21). Moreover, continued fieldwork efforts in less explored areas have shown that hominoids lived across Afro-Arabia during the Miocene (22)(23)(24)(25). In addition, remains of putative hominines have been found in East Africa (26,27), perhaps even in Europe (28,29). Finally, paleoenvironmental reconstructions for late Miocene apes and hominins suggest the Pan-Homo LCA inhabited woodlands, not tropical rainforests (30)(31)(32)(33).The Pan-like LCA model builds on the "East side story" of hominin origins (17), a seriouslychallenged scenario.

        <p>Current debates about the transition from an ape into a bipedal hominin are centered on the morphological and locomotor reconstruction of the Pan-Homo LCA, as well as its paleobiogeography. Discrepancies are caused by conflicting evolutionary signals among living and fossil hominoids-indicating rampant "homoplasy" (independent evolution causing "false homology")-and further complicated by the highly incomplete and fragmentary nature of the hominoid fossil record. This review argues that, in spite of the limitations, the information provided by fossil apes is essential to inform evolutionary scenarios of human origins.Current debates about the transition from an ape into a bipedal hominin are centered on the morphological and locomotor reconstruction of the Pan-Homo LCA, as well as its paleobiogeography.

        <p>Since Linnaeus established modern taxonomy in 1758 (34) and until the 1960s, morphological similarity was the main basis for classifying organisms. Linnaeus included modern humans (Homo sapiens) within the order Primates, but it was not until 1863 that Huxley provided the first systematic review of differences and similarities between humans and apes (2). Imagining himself as a "scientific Saturnian" Huxley stated: "The structural differences between Man and the Manlike apes certainly justify our regarding him as constituting a family apart from them; though, inasmuch as he differs less from them than they do from other families of the same order, there can be no justification for placing him in a distinct order" (2, p. 104). Huxley's work was motivated by widespread claims (e.g., Cuvier, Owen) that humans' "uniqueness" warranted their placement in a separate order. Darwin concurred with Huxley that humans should be classified in their own family within primates (1).Since Linnaeus established modern taxonomy in 1758 (34) and until the 1960s, morphological similarity was the main basis for classifying organisms.

        <p>We now know that most "human features" are primitive traits inherited from primate (e.g., trichromatic stereoscopic vision, manual grasping) or earlier (e.g., five digits) ancestors (35). Even humans' uniquely large brains and delayed maturation are framed within a primate trend of increased encephalization and slower life history compared with other mammals (35,36). Some differences in brain size may partly reflect a neocortex enlargement related to enhanced visual and grasping abilities (37). Like extant great apes, humans display larger body size, larger relative brain size, a slower life history profile, and more elaborated cognitive abilities than other primates (hylobatids included) (36). However, modern humans are extreme outliers in terms of delayed maturation, encephalization, advanced cognition and manual dexterity, ultimately leading to symbolic language and technology (38).We now know that most "human features" are primitive traits inherited from primate (e.g., trichromatic stereoscopic vision, manual grasping) or earlier (e.g., five digits) ancestors (35).

        <p>Anatomically, only two adaptive complexes represent synapomorphies present in all hominins: the loss of the canine honing complex and features related to habitual bipedalism (33,39). Most anthropoids possess large and sexually dimorphic canines coupled with body size differences between males and females, reflecting levels of agonistic behavior and sociosexual structure (40).Anatomically, only two adaptive complexes represent synapomorphies present in all hominins: the loss of the canine honing complex and features related to habitual bipedalism (33,39).

        <p>The fossil record indicates that there was a reduction in canine height, leading to the loss of the honing complex in early hominins (41).

        <p>Darwin linked origin of bipedalism with an adaptive complex related to freeing the hands from locomotion to use and make tools (replacing large canines), leading to a reciprocal feedback loop involving brain size, cognition, culture, and eventually civilization (1). Multiple variants in the order of these events have been advocated, with the freeing of the hands alternatively linked to tools (43), food acquisition and carrying (15), or provisioning within a monogamous social structure (44), to name a few. There is general agreement that canine reduction (including social structure changes), enhanced manipulative capabilities and bipedalism were interrelated during human evolution. However, determining the order of events and their causality requires reconstructing the ape-human last common ancestor (LCA) from which hominins originated.Darwin linked origin of bipedalism with an adaptive complex related to freeing the hands from locomotion to use and make tools (replacing large canines), leading to a reciprocal feedback loop involving brain size, cognition, culture, and eventually civilization (1).

        <p>Darwin also speculated that humans and modern African ape ancestors originated in Africa (1), based on the anatomical similarities identified by Huxley, and his own observations that many living mammals are closely related to extinct species of the same region. However, given the limited ape fossil record then, he concluded that it was "useless to speculate on this subject" (1, p. 199). Using the French Dryopithecus to calibrate his "clock," Darwin concluded that humans likely diverged as early as the Eocene, and warned against "the error of supposing that the early progenitor of the whole Simian stock, including man, was identical with, or even closely resembled, any existing ape or monkey" (1, p. 199). These ideas inaugurated a century of discussions about human's place in nature.Darwin also speculated that humans and modern African ape ancestors originated in Africa (1), based on the anatomical similarities identified by Huxley, and his own observations that many living mammals are closely related to extinct species of the same region.

        <p>Following the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species (45), Haeckel predicted that the "missing link" (dubbed "Pithecanthropus," the "ape-man") would be found in Asia (46). This idea led to Dubois' 1891 discovery of Homo erectus in Indonesia (47). In 1925, Dart published the discovery of Australopithecus africanus, "the man-ape from South Africa" (48). However, the scientific community still focused on Europe due to the Piltdown "fossils," until exposed as a hoax (49). Asia remained a "mother continent" contender due to the "man-like ape" Ramapithecus, discovered in the Indian Siwaliks (50).Following the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species (45), Haeckel predicted that the "missing link" (dubbed "Pithecanthropus," the "ape-man") would be found in Asia (46).

        <p>During this time, the relationships of humans to other primates were highly contentious. Most authors advocated an ancient divergence of humans from apes (51,52), or favored a closer relationship to the great apes than to the lesser apes (53,54). A few proposed that humans were more closely related to one or both of the African apes (55,56), although these views were not widely accepted (57). These alternative phylogenetic hypotheses heavily impacted reconstructions of the LCA. Some (e.g., Schultz, Straus) advocated for a "generalized" ape ancestor (52), while others relied on extant hominoid models. Notably, Keith developed a scenario in which a "hylobatian" brachiating stage preceded an African ape-like creature: a knuckle-walking "troglodytian" phase immediately preceding bipedalism (11). Focused on Keith's "hylobatian" stage, Morton proposed that the "vertically suspended posture" of a small-bodied hylobatid-like ancestor caused the erect posture of human bipedalism (12). Gregory, another prominent "brachiationist," supported similar views (53). Morton argued that knuckle walking did not represent an intermediate stage preceding bipedalism, but a reversion toward quadrupedalism in large-bodied apes specialized for brachiation. Then, "brachiation" was used for any locomotion in which the body was suspended by the hands. Currently it refers to the pendulum-like arm-swinging locomotion of hylobatids (6).During this time, the relationships of humans to other primates were highly contentious.

        <p>By the 1960s, the Leakeys' discoveries in Tanzania, [e.g., Paranthropus boisei (58), Homo habilis (59)], reinforced the relevance of Africa in human evolution, which became established as the "mother continent" with the Australopithecus afarensis discoveries during the 1970s (60,61).By the 1960s, the Leakeys' discoveries in Tanzania, [e.g., Paranthropus boisei (58), Homo habilis (59)], reinforced the relevance of Africa in human evolution, which became established as the "mother continent" with the Australopithecus afarensis discoveries during the 1970s (60,61).</p>
        <p>LCA models still centered on the available fossil apes (mostly represented by jaw fragments and isolated teeth), found after decades of paleontological fieldwork in Africa and Eurasia. In 1965, Simons and Pilbeam (62) revised and organized available Miocene apes in three genera: Dryopithecus, Gigantopithecus and Ramapithecus. The genus Sivapithecus was included in Dryopithecus, considered the ancestor of African apes, whereas Ramapithecus was considered ancestral to humans based on its short face (and inferred small canines) (63). Leakey (64) and others agreed with Simons and Pilbeam that humans belong to their own family (Hominidae, or "hominids"), whereas great apes would belong to a distinct family (Pongidae, or "pongids"). He also agreed that Ramapithecus was an Asian early human ancestor. However, Leakey proposed reserving the genus Sivapithecus for the "Asian dryopithecines," and claimed that the human lineage could be traced back to, at least, the middle Miocene of Africa with Kenyapithecus wickeri (~14 Ma).LCA models still centered on the available fossil apes (mostly represented by jaw fragments and isolated teeth), found after decades of paleontological fieldwork in Africa and Eurasia.

        <p>Two major "revolutions" in the study of evolutionary relationships started in the 1960s. First, a series of studies jumpstarted the field of molecular anthropology: Blood protein comparisons by Zuckerkandl et al. (65) and Goodman (66) found that some great apes-gorillas and chimpanzees-were more closely related to humans than to orangutans. Sarich and Wilson developed an "immunological molecular clock" and concluded that African apes and humans share a common ancestor as recent as ~5 Ma (67). These results led to decades-long debates regarding the African ape-human split. For example, Washburn resurrected extant African apes as ancestral models in human evolution, proposing knuckle walking as the precursor of terrestrial bipedalism (68). In contrast, paleontologists argued that the molecular clock was inaccurate because of the much older age of the purported human ancestors Kenyapithecus and Ramapithecus (69). Second, Hennigian cladistics ("phylogenetic systematics")-which only recognizes "synapomorphies" (shared derived features) as informative for reconstructing phylogeny (70)-became slowly implemented in anthropology by the mid-1970s (71).Two major "revolutions" in the study of evolutionary relationships started in the 1960s.

        <p>Extant African apes have been considered ancestral models since Keith's "troglodytian" stage in the 1920s (11), and especially since the 1960s, with updated hypotheses inspired by the "molecular revolution" (68,78) and field discoveries on chimpanzee behavior by Goodall (79). Louis Leakey played a central role in promoting Goodall's pioneering research (subsequently fostering Fossey's in gorillas and Galdikas's in orangutans). Currently, a prominent paradigm proposes that chimpanzees represent "living fossils" closely depicting the Pan-Homo LCA (14,16). This model combines molecular data with the anachronistic view that Gorilla and Pan are morphologically similar (75). Under these assumptions, knuckle walking-once used to defend African ape monophyly (80)-is used to argue that African apes are morphologically "conservative" and only display size-related differences (14). This model contends that gorillas are allometrically enlarged chimps and that chimpanzees [or bonobos (78)] constitute a suitable model for the Pan-Homo LCA, perhaps even the hominine or hominid LCAs (14). This narrative also incorporates the paleobiogeographic assumption that African apes likely occupy the same habitats as their ancestors: Without new selection pressures, there was no need for evolution.Extant African apes have been considered ancestral models since Keith's "troglodytian" stage in the 1920s (11), and especially since the 1960s, with updated hypotheses inspired by the "molecular revolution" (68,78) and field discoveries on chimpanzee behavior by Goodall (79).

        <p>If hominins originated from a chimpanzee-like LCA, human bipedalism must have evolved from knuckle walking (15)-a functional compromise enabling terrestrial travel while retaining climbing adaptations (80). Under this view, bipedal hominins originated from an ancestor that was already terrestrial while traveling. These conclusions are logical from a "top-down" perspective, based on the evidence provided by extant hominoids and early hominins. However, a fullyinformed theory of hominin origins must also apply a "bottom-up" approach (81,82), from the perspective of extinct apes preceding the Pan-Homo split. It is also essential to clarify whether chimpanzees represent a good ancestral model for the Pan-Homo LCA. Unfortunately, the view from the bottom is blurry.If hominins originated from a chimpanzee-like LCA, human bipedalism must have evolved from knuckle walking (15)-a functional compromise enabling terrestrial travel while retaining climbing adaptations (80).

        <p>With more than 50 hominoid genera and a broad geographic distribution (Fig. 1), the Miocene has been dubbed "The real planet of the apes" (83). Besides their fragmentary nature, a persistent challenge is understanding the phylogenetic relationships among fossil apes exhibiting mosaics of primitive and derived features with no modern analogs. The Asian Miocene ape Sivapithecus best exemplifies this complexity. Discoveries during the 1970s and 1980s, including a facial skeleton (84), clarified that Ramapithecus is a junior synonym of Sivapithecus, which is likely related to orangutans (85). However, two Sivapithecus humeri show a primitive (pronograde-related) morphology, calling into question the close phylogenetic link with Pongo inferred from facial similarities (86).With more than 50 hominoid genera and a broad geographic distribution (Fig. 1), the Miocene has been dubbed "The real planet of the apes" (83).

        <p>The root of this "Sivapithecus dilemma" ( 18) is identifying where "phylogenetic signal" is best captured in hominoids: the postcranium or the cranium? The former implies that a Pongo-like face evolved independently twice; the latter that some postcranial similarities among living apes evolved more than once. Both hypotheses highlight the phylogenetic noise that homoplasy introduces in phylogenetic inference. Indeed, several studies have found that homoplasy similarly affects both anatomical areas (87). The conclusion that Sivapithecus is not a pongine relies on the assumption that suspensory adaptations and other orthograde-related features present in living hominoids were inherited from their LCA (18). However, this is contradicted by differences among living apes [e.g., forelimb and hand anatomy, degree of limb elongation, hip abduction capability (8,9,19,80,(88)(89)(90)(91)]. These studies concluded that apparent similarities could represent independently evolved biomechanical solutions to similar locomotor selection pressures. For instance, hand length "similarities" among living apes result from different combinations of metacarpal and/or phalangeal elongation in each extant genus (9).The root of this "Sivapithecus dilemma" ( 18) is identifying where "phylogenetic signal" is best captured in hominoids: the postcranium or the cranium?

Both hypotheses highlight the phylogenetic noise that homoplasy introduces in phylogenetic inference. Indeed, several studies have found that homoplasy similarly affects both anatomical areas (87). The conclusion that Sivapithecus is not a pongine relies on the assumption that suspensory adaptations and other orthograde-related features present in living hominoids were inherited from their LCA (18). However, this is contradicted by differences among living apes [e.g., forelimb and hand anatomy, degree of limb elongation, hip abduction capability (8,9,19,80,(88)(89)(90)(91)]. These studies concluded that apparent similarities could represent independently evolved biomechanical solutions to similar locomotor selection pressures.

        <p>Parallel evolution-homoplasy among closely related taxa due to shared genetic and developmental pathways-could explain some postcranial similarities related to suspensory behaviors among extant apes (80). Compared with convergences among distantly-related taxa, parallelisms are more subtle and difficult to detect, and readily evolve when similar selection pressures appear. Within extant primates, suspensory adaptions evolved independently in atelines and between hylobatids and great apes (8,80,88,91,92). When the hominoid fossil record is added, independent evolution of suspensory adaptations has been inferred too for orangutans, chimpanzees, and some extinct lineages (9,89,93,94). Knuckle walking has also been proposed to have different origins in gorillas and chimpanzees (80,93,95). As for suspension, the preexistence of an orthograde body plan, vertical climbing, and general arboreal heritage could have facilitated the independent evolution of knuckle walking to circumvent similar biomechanical demands during terrestrial quadrupedalism, while preserving a powerful grasping hand suitable for arboreal locomotion (9).Parallel evolution-homoplasy among closely related taxa due to shared genetic and developmental pathways-could explain some postcranial similarities related to suspensory behaviors among extant apes (80).

        <p>Sivapithecus and other fossil Asian great apes (e.g., Khoratpithecus, Ankarapithecus, Lufengpithecus) are generally considered pongines (Fig. 3) based on derived craniodental traits shared with Pongo (94,(96)(97)(98), although alternative views exist, particularly for Lufengpithecus (99). In contrast, the phylogenetic position of apes from the African early (e.g., Ekembo, Morotopithecus) and middle Miocene (Kenyapithecus, Nacholapithecus, Equatorius) remains very controversial. Like Sivapithecus, they exhibit only some modern hominoid features superimposed onto a primitive-looking pronograde ("monkey-like") body plan (Fig. 2). Some authors interpret this mosaicism as indicating that most Miocene apes do not belong within the crown hominoid radiation and, thus, are irrelevant to reconstructions of the Pan-Homo LCA ( 14). This is likely the case for early Miocene African taxa. However, the vertebrae of Morotopithecus [~20 Ma (100) or ~17 Ma ( 101)] display orthogrady-related features absent from other stem hominoids-indicating either a closer relationship with crown hominoids or an independent evolution of orthogrady (102). In turn, Kenyapithecus and Nacholapithecus are commonly regarded as preceding the pongine-hominine split due to the possession of some modern hominid craniodental synapomorphies combined with a more primitive postcranium than in living great apes (94,103).

        <p>The large-bodied apes from the middle-to-late Miocene of Europe are at the center of discussions about great ape and human evolution (19,28,94,104,105). Named after Dryopithecus (3), they are generally distinguished as a subfamily (Dryopithecinae) (94) or tribe (Dryopithecini) (28). However, it is unclear if they constitute a monophyletic group or a paraphyletic assemblage of stem and crown hominoids (94). Thus, we refer to them informally as "dryopiths." These apes are dentally conservative, but each genus exhibits different cranial and postcranial morphology. The dryopith fossil record includes the oldest skeletons consistently exhibiting postcranial features of living hominoids (orthograde body plan and/or long and more curved digits). Dryopithecus (~12-11 Ma) is known from craniodental remains and isolated postcranials too scarce to reconstruct its overall anatomy (106). In contrast, Pierolapithecus (~12 Ma) is represented by a cranium with associated partial skeleton (19). Cranially a great ape, its rib, clavicle, lumbar, and wrist morphologies are unambiguous evidence of an orthograde body plan. Yet, unlike chimpanzees and orangutans (but similar to gorillas), Pierolapithecus lacks specialized below-branch suspensory adaptations [see discussion in (10)]. The recently described Danuvius (~11.6 Ma, Germany), and the slightly younger (~10-9 Ma) Hispanopithecus (Spain) (105) and Rudapithecus (Hungary) (28) represent the oldest record of specialized below-branch suspensory adaptations (e.g., long and strongly curved phalanges; Fig. 2). Danuvius has also been argued to show adaptations to habitual bipedalism (but see below).The large-bodied apes from the middle-to-late Miocene of Europe are at the center of discussions about great ape and human evolution (19,28,94,104,105).

        <p>The different mosaic morphology exhibited by each dryopith genus is a major challenge for deciphering their phylogenetic relationships (Fig. 3). Current competing phylogenetic hypotheses consider dryopiths as stem hominoids (107,108), stem hominids (94,96,109) or crown hominids closer to either pongines (105), hominines (28), or even hominins (29,110). However, recent phylogenetic analyses of apes recovered dryopiths as stem hominids (97,109), perhaps except Ouranopithecus (~9-8 Ma) and Graecopithecus (~7 Ma) (97). Ouranopithecus has been interpreted by some as a stem hominine, or even as a crown member more closely related to the gorilla or human lineages (110). Graecopithecus has also been advocated as a hominin (29), although the fragmentary available material hinders evaluation of this hypothesis. Such contrasting views about dryopiths stem from their incomplete and fragmentary fossil record coupled with pervasive homoplasy. However, as these factors are equal for all researchers, their different conclusions must also relate to analytical differences (e.g., taxonomy, sampling, polymorphic and continuous trait treatment).

        <p>If dryopiths are stem hominids, they could either be close to the crown group or constitute an evolutionary dead-end, an independent "experiment" not directly related to either pongines or hominines. Alternatively, dryopiths might be crown hominids more closely related to one of these groups. If dryopiths are hominines, this implies that the latter could have originated in Europe and subsequently dispersed "back to Africa" during the late Miocene (28,29,83). This would coincide with vegetation structure changes caused by a trend of increased cooling and seasonality (32) that ultimately drove European apes to extinction [or back to Africa (28)]. In this scenario, hominines and pongines would be vicariant groups that originally evolved in Europe and Asia, respectively, from early kenyapith ancestors. Given the suspensory specializations of late Miocene dryopiths (Hispanopithecus and Rudapithecus), if modern African apes originated from these forms, this scenario involves that the hominine ancestor could have been more reliant on suspension than living chimpanzees or gorillas. The claim that hominines originated outside of Africa may be justified by cladistic analyses recovering dryopiths as stem hominines, but not based on the lack of late Miocene great apes in Africa because fossils from this critical time period have been discovered (~13-7 Ma) (Fig. 3). Both molecular and paleontological evidence (e.g., Sivapithecus) situate the pongine-hominine divergence within the middle Miocene.

Cladistically, dryopiths would be pongines, but would share none of the currentlyrecognized pongine autapomorphies, evolved after the second vicariant event. This scenario is difficult to test, but it would be consistent with the apparent absence of clear pongine synapomorphies in Lufengpithecus (99) and the more derived nasoalveolar morphology of Nacholapithecus (103) compared with some dryopiths (106).

        <p>The decades-long feud regarding arboreality and bipedalism in Australopithecus afarensis exemplifies the complexity of inferring function from anatomy. "Totalist" functional morphologists rely on a species' "total morphological pattern" (121) to infer its locomotor repertoire. Totalists see a bipedal early hominin with some ape-like retentions (e.g., curved fingers) pointing to continued use of the trees, and that certain not-yet-human-like features (e.g., hip) indicate a different type of bipedalism (122). Instead, "directionalists"-for whom functional inferences are only possible for derived traits evolved for a specific function-focus exclusively on bipedal adaptations (123). Totalist and directionalist interpretations of the fossil record differ in the "adaptive significance" attributed to primitive features, which result in different behavioral reconstructions. Two other related factors further complicate locomotor inferences in extinct species: First, different positional behaviors have similar mechanical demands [e.g., bipedalism, quadrupedalism and some types of climbing (39)]. Second, pre-existing morphofunctional complexes originally selected to fulfill a particular function (adaptations) can be subsequently coopted for a new role (exaptations).The decades-long feud regarding arboreality and bipedalism in Australopithecus afarensis exemplifies the complexity of inferring function from anatomy.

        <p>The mosaic nature of hominoid morphological evolution makes the functional reconstruction of fossil apes especially challenging, as recently exemplified by Danuvius (104): It was described as possessing long and curved fingers, a long and flexible vertebral column, hip and knee joints indicative of extended postures, and an ankle configuration aligning the foot perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia. Such a combination of features was functionally interpreted as indicating below-branch suspension combined with above-branch bipedalism. However, a critique to the original study concluded that the morphological affinities of Danuvius with modern great apes support a positional repertoire including orthogrady and suspension, but not bipedalism (124). Part of the "problem" with the original interpretation is that it infers a derived locomotor behaviorbipedalism-from primitive features that are also functionally related to quadrupedalism. For instance, the inferred "long-back" morphology of Danuvius is characteristic of most quadrupedal monkeys and other Miocene apes (125), denoting the lack of trunk specialization seen in extant great apes. The Danuvius femoral head joint, being (primitively) posterosuperiorly expanded (126), is consistent with flexed quadrupedal hip postures that are not used during human-like bipedalism. In addition, the distal tibia configuration of Danuvius is shared with Ekembo and cercopithecoids (104), thus being likely plesiomorphic and not unique to bipeds. When the primitive and derived features of Danuvius are considered, a totalist would argue that it combined high degrees of plesiomorphic quadrupedal locomotion with novel (suspensory) behaviors, whereas a directionalist would downplay the primitive features in favor of the newly derived adaptive traits (i.e., suspension).The mosaic nature of hominoid morphological evolution makes the functional reconstruction of fossil apes especially challenging, as recently exemplified by Danuvius (104): It was described as possessing long and curved fingers, a long and flexible vertebral column, hip and knee joints indicative of extended postures, and an ankle configuration aligning the foot perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia.

        <p>Bone is a living tissue, and growth is expected to occur in predictable ways that reflect loading patterns throughout life (131). Thus, cross-sectional and trabecular bone properties and their links to behavior are widely investigated (132,133). Yet, experimental studies indicate that internal bone morphology does not necessarily match stereotypical loading patterns (134). Ample evidence suggests that irregular loading, including low-magnitude, can be more osteogenically potent than stereotypical loading (135). This may bias interpretations of individual fossils with a speciesatypical loading pattern during life (e.g., due to an injury). Bone (re)modeling also does not consistently occur in response to changes in loading pattern: It can occur in ways that detract from-rather than enhance-function (136), and may manifest differentially across the skeleton (137). Incongruence also exists between actual bone performance and expectations based on aspects of internal morphology (138). Finally, there is a strong genetic component to the responsiveness of bone (re)modeling to loading (136), which is largely unknown for most species.Bone is a living tissue, and growth is expected to occur in predictable ways that reflect loading patterns throughout life (131).

Bone (re)modeling also does not consistently occur in response to changes in loading pattern: It can occur in ways that detract from-rather than enhance-function (136), and may manifest differentially across the skeleton (137). Incongruence also exists between actual bone performance and expectations based on aspects of internal morphology (138). Finally, there is a strong genetic component to the responsiveness of bone (re)modeling to loading (136), which is largely unknown for most species.</p>

        <p>Competing hypotheses about the locomotor behavior immediately preceding hominin bipedalism include terrestrial knuckle walking (15), palmigrade quadrupedalism (93), and different types of arboreal (orthograde) behaviors such as climbing and suspension (7), vertical climbing (139), or arboreal bipedalism and suspension (104,140). Miocene great apes can enlighten this question by helping to identify the polarity of evolutionary change preceding the Pan-Homo divergence (81,82). For instance, if Pierolapithecus is interpreted as an orthograde ape without specific suspensory adaptations but retaining quadrupedal adaptations [see alternatives in (10)], the orthograde body plan and ulnocarpal contact loss could be interpreted as an adaptation to vertical climbing, subsequently co-opted for suspension (19). Similarly, habitual bipedalism might have directly evolved from other orthograde behaviors without an intermediate stage of advanced suspension or specialized knuckle walking. Hence, Pierolapithecus complements previous hypotheses that biomechanical aspects of the lower limb during quadrupedalism and vertical climbing could be functionally "pre-adaptive" for bipedalism (39,139).Competing hypotheses about the locomotor behavior immediately preceding hominin bipedalism include terrestrial knuckle walking (15), palmigrade quadrupedalism (93), and different types of arboreal (orthograde) behaviors such as climbing and suspension (7), vertical climbing (139), or arboreal bipedalism and suspension (104,140).

        <p>A holistic view indicates that the Pan-Homo LCA was a Miocene ape with extant great ape-like cognitive abilities, likely possessing a complex social structure and tool traditions (36,38,141). This ape would exhibit some degree of body size and canine sexual dimorphism (with large honing male canines) (15), indicating a polygynous sociosexual system (40). Based on Miocene apes and earliest hominins, it is also likely that the Pan-Homo LCA was orthograde and proficient at vertical climbing [see alternative interpretation based on Ardipithecus (33,93)], but not necessarily at specialized below-branch suspension or knuckle walking (9,33). Chimpanzees seem to retain the Pan-Homo LCA plesiomorphic condition in some regards [e.g., brain and body size (38), vertebral counts (125), foot morphology (142)]. However, in others [e.g., interlimb (93), hand (9), pelvis (143) length proportions; femur morphology (89)] early hominins are more similar to generalized Miocene apes. These results further reinforce the idea that functional aspects of other locomotor types were co-opted for bipedalism during hominin origins.A holistic view indicates that the Pan-Homo LCA was a Miocene ape with extant great ape-like cognitive abilities, likely possessing a complex social structure and tool traditions (36,38,141).

        <p>The "East Side Story" scenario links the divergence of chimpanzees and humans to the rifting of East Africa, which would have triggered a vicariant speciation event from the ancestral Pan-Homo LCA (17). Chimpanzees would have remained "frozen in time" in their ancestral tropical forest environment, while humans would be the descendants of the group "left behind" on the east side of the Rift. Major climate and landscape changes would have then forced earliest hominins to adapt to more open (grassland savanna) environments by acquiring bipedalism-and the rest is history.The "East Side Story" scenario links the divergence of chimpanzees and humans to the rifting of East Africa, which would have triggered a vicariant speciation event from the ancestral Pan-Homo LCA (17).

        <p>The landscape of East Africa has dramatically changed during the last 10 million years due to tectonic events leading to specific climatic conditions and associated changes in vegetation structure-from mixed tropical forest to more heterogeneous and arid environments than elsewhere in tropical Africa (144,145). The trend of progressive aridification did not culminate in the predominance of savanna environments until ~2.0 Ma-roughly coinciding with hominin brain size increase and the appearance of Homo erectus-and was punctuated by alternating episodes of extreme humidity and aridity, resulting in a fluctuating extension of forests through time (144,145). Despite ongoing discussions about early hominin paleoenvironments (woodland with forest patches vs. wooded savanna) (146), evidence from Miocene apes (30,31) supports that the Pan-Homo LCA inhabited some kind of woodland. Therefore, it has been suggested that the Pan-Homo LCA was probably more omnivorous than chimpanzees (ripe fruit specialists) and likely fed both in trees and on the ground (33)-in agreement with isotopic analyses for Ardipithecus ramidus (41).The landscape of East Africa has dramatically changed during the last 10 million years due to tectonic events leading to specific climatic conditions and associated changes in vegetation structure-from mixed tropical forest to more heterogeneous and arid environments than elsewhere in tropical Africa (144,145).

        <p>Bipedalism would have emerged due to the selection pressures created by the progressive fragmentation of forested habitats and the need for terrestrial travel from one feeding patch to the next. Data on extant ape positional behaviors (Fig. 4) suggest that hominin terrestrial bipedalism originated as a posture rather than a means of travel on the ground (147) or in trees (140). Rose (39) proposed a long process of increasing commitment to bipedality in the transition to more complex open habitats throughout the Plio-Pleistocene, and Potts (148) argued that key stages in hominin evolution may relate to adaptive responses to cope with highly-variable environments.Bipedalism would have emerged due to the selection pressures created by the progressive fragmentation of forested habitats and the need for terrestrial travel from one feeding patch to the next.

        <p>The fossil and archeological records provide a new twist to the order of evolutionary events in early hominin evolution. The remains of Orrorin and Ardipithecus ramidus indicate that habitual terrestrial bipedalism, enhanced precision grasping, and loss of canine honing evolved at the dawn of the human lineage well before brain enlargement (9,33,89,93). It was not until later in time (maybe starting with Australopithecus (149), and continuing with Homo), that some pre-existing hand attributes were co-opted for purposive and systematic stone tool making in more encephalized hominins with more advanced cognitive abilities (38,150).The fossil and archeological records provide a new twist to the order of evolutionary events in early hominin evolution.

        <p>That hominins continuously evolved since the Pan-Homo LCA is universally accepted, but the possibility that all living hominoids (including chimpanzees) experienced their own evolutionary histories is sometimes disregarded. Potts (151) suggested that the greater cognitive abilities of great apes originated to continue exploiting fruit supplies from densely forested environments in front of strong environmental variability. Coupled with locomotor adaptations (e.g., vertical climbing, suspension) enabling an efficient navigation through the canopy, this "cognitive trap" would consist of an adaptive feedback loop between diet, locomotion, cognition and life-history.That hominins continuously evolved since the Pan-Homo LCA is universally accepted, but the possibility that all living hominoids (including chimpanzees) experienced their own evolutionary histories is sometimes disregarded.

        <p>Although hominids originated approximately during the "Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum" (~17-15 Ma), their subsequent radiation from ~14 Ma onward paralleled a trend of climatic "deterioration" during the rest of the Miocene (152). Great apes might have initially thrived by evolving particular adaptations to more efficient exploit their habitats, thereby occupying new adaptive peaks without abandoning the same area of the adaptive landscape broadly occupied by earlier stem hominoids. Nevertheless, this evolutionary strategy would become unsustainable once a particular paleoenvironmental threshold was surpassed. This could explain the fate of European dryopiths, which survived for some time under suboptimal conditions (despite the progressive trend of cooling and increased seasonality) until they vanished (94).Although hominids originated approximately during the "Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum" (~17-15 Ma), their subsequent radiation from ~14 Ma onward paralleled a trend of climatic "deterioration" during the rest of the Miocene (152).

        <p>The dietary, locomotor and cognitive specializations of late Miocene great apes would have hindered their shift into new adaptive peaks suitable for the more open environments toward the latest Miocene (153). The Miocene planet of the apes became the time of the more generalist Old World monkeys, enabling their survival in a wider variety of seasonal habitats (30,92,154). The same specialization trap can explain the delayed retreat of pongines (and hylobatids) to southeastern Asia throughout the Plio-Pleistocene. The highly specialized orangutans remain extant, but not for long as their habitat continues to shrink. African apes could partially overcome the specialization trap by evolving (perhaps in parallel) semiterrestrial adaptations-knuckle walking. Gorillas also expanded their dietary range (more folivorous) and enlarged their body size.The dietary, locomotor and cognitive specializations of late Miocene great apes would have hindered their shift into new adaptive peaks suitable for the more open environments toward the latest Miocene (153).

        <p>Contrary to the view that gorillas are "enlarged" chimpanzees, morphometric analyses indicate that gorillas underwent their own evolutionary history, resulting in different ontogenetic trajectories (155,156) and postcranial differences that cannot be explained by size-scaling effects (9,143). Why, when, and how many times knuckle walking evolved is more difficult to explain than the origin of hominin bipedalism. Habitat fragmentation coupled with a higher reliance on arboreal feeding might be invoked (i.e., knuckle walking serves both terrestrial and arboreal locomotion). This idea is difficult to reconcile with the premise that continuous-canopy forests covered the tropical belt of central and western Africa since the Miocene-unless gorillas and chimpanzees evolved in less densely-forested habitats (30,31,114), and retreated to tropical forests when outcompeted by hominins and/or cercopithecoids. Ironically, the same specializations that allowed great apes to survive despite major environmental challenges since the late Miocene might ultimately doom them to extinction.Contrary to the view that gorillas are "enlarged" chimpanzees, morphometric analyses indicate that gorillas underwent their own evolutionary history, resulting in different ontogenetic trajectories (155,156) and postcranial differences that cannot be explained by size-scaling effects (9,143).

        <p>Hominins might have escaped the great ape specialization trap by evolving novel and more radical adaptations: bipedalism (another specialized orthograde locomotion), concomitant freeing of the hands, and subsequent enhanced manual dexterity, brain configuration, sociosexual behavior, and culturally-mediated technology. Human evolution also reflects the progressive adaptation (biological first, cultural later) to ever-changing environments (39,148). Some essential changes (upright posture, enhanced cognition) are just the continuation of a trend started in Miocene hominoids (19,36,151). While escaping from the great ape specialization trap humans might have fallen in another evolutionary cul-de-sac-with current human activities and overpopulation leading the biosphere to a point beyond return (157).

        <p>More fieldwork is necessary to find fossil apes close to the gorilla or chimpanzee lineages, and it is essential to extend such efforts to unexplored or undersampled areas (Fig. 1). It is also essential to continue developing tools of phylogenetic inference. Bayesian approaches are promising, but uncertainty remains about their applicability to morphological data (159). Improvements in the treatment of continuous characters and recent methodological advances for analyzing 3D geometric morphometric data within a cladistic framework (in combination with traditional characters) are promising for reconstructing fossil hominoid phylogeny (160). The oldest (recently retrieved) ancient DNA is ~1 Ma (161). Paleoproteomics could be a complementary solution since it has enabled sampling further back in time up to ~2 Ma, recently confirming the pongine status of Gigantopithecus (162).

        <p>Locomotor reconstructions of the Pan-Homo LCA and other fossil hominoids are seriously hampered by the lack of current analogs. Washburn spotted the fundamental limitation: "it is not possible to bring the past into the laboratory. No one can see a walking Australopithecus" (163, p. 67). Such inferences rely on morphofunctional assumptions of bone, joint, or muscle function, but experimentally-derived biomechanical data are required to test these assumptions and provide reliable inferences from fossils. Technological advances now facilitate non-invasive kinematic data collection from animals in their natural environments (164). In turn, experimental and morphological information should be integrated to better predict the locomotion of fossil hominoids. Forward dynamic simulations offer a powerful pathway for predicting de novo movements in fossil species while iterating possible effects of morphology and soft tissue (165).Locomotor reconstructions of the Pan-Homo LCA and other fossil hominoids are seriously hampered by the lack of current analogs.
