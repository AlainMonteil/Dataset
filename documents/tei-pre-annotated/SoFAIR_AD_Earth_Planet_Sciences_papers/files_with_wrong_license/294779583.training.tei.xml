The results show that the weight percentage of the PMs varies from 4 to 6% in the speakers, 2.5 to 2.8% in the hard disks, and between 0.8 and 2% in some electric motors from hybrid electric vehicles (Menad and Seron, 2017).

        <p>These numbers are concerning the governments and industry analysts regarding future prices and availabilities (Rabe et al., 2017) but also concerning environmental impact of this element in aquatic systems. Permanent magnets are also used in wind turbines, missiles, tanks, warplanes and submarines (Padhan et al., 2017). An advantage of using these magnets over alternative technologies in wind turbines is that they reduce the turbine´s size and decreases the overall weight (Rabe et al., 2017). Even so, typically wind turbines contain about 150-200 kg of Nd per megawatt of generating capacity (Hatch, 2012), which means that most offshore wind turbines may require two tons of this REE (Turra, 2018).These numbers are concerning the governments and industry analysts regarding future prices and availabilities (Rabe et al., 2017) but also concerning environmental impact of this element in aquatic systems.

        <p>The increase application of Nd in high-tech processes and products leads to the release of this element into the environment, mainly in the rivers and coastal areas not only due to the disposal of e-waste (50 million tons in 2018) but also from the mining activities which is the primary source of REEs discharge into water systems (Adeel et al., 2019;UNEP et al., 2019). The concentration of Nd in waters depends on several factors such as climate, geology and vegetation and its most common oxidation state is Nd(III). A wide range of REEs concentrations has been detected in agricultural soils (&lt; 15.9-249.1µg/g) and in groundwater (&lt; 3.1-146.2 µg/L) at various sites worldwide (Adeel et al., 2019), with Nd being the third element most abundant (after Ce and La).The increase application of Nd in high-tech processes and products leads to the release of this element into the environment, mainly in the rivers and coastal areas not only due to the disposal of e-waste (50 million tons in 2018) but also from the mining activities which is the primary source of REEs discharge into water systems (Adeel et al., 2019;UNEP et al., 2019).

        <p>The concentration of REEs in soils and sediment is higher than in water resources due to pH and cationic exchange capacity. This occurs because most REEs may adsorb to soils and sediments through their dissolution and surface complexation reactions with inorganic and organic ligands (Gwenzi et al., 2018). The concentration of Nd in the environment is in the order of ng/L: 2.8 ng/L in seawater (Tai et al., 2010), 0.76 -15 ng/L in rain water, 16.9 ng/L in throughfall, 58 ng/L in aqueous phase of the soil and 84.9 ng/L in stream water (Kabata-Pendias and Mukherjee, 2007). Despite that, its concentration in surface waters is about a few µg/L, while in contaminated environments it increases until hundreds of µg/L. The Terengganu River Basin, in Malaysia, is an example of a surface water where concentrations of Nd between 0.0071 and 6.68 µg/L were detected (Sultan and Shazili, 2009). As for the contaminated environments, it was detected 771 µg/L in streams draining from acid sulphate soils during high-water flow events in autumn, in Finland (Åström, 2001). In an alluvial aquifer affected by acid mine drainage (Guadiamar, Spain) it was detected &lt; 0.01 -52.67 µg/L (Olías et al., 2005). It was also found a concentration of Nd of 10.8 µg/L (Khan et al., 2017) and 317 µg/L (Migaszewski et al., 2016) in the surface water of the ex-mining pit lake (Malaysia) and in a mining pit in Wisniowka (Poland), respectively.The concentration of REEs in soils and sediment is higher than in water resources due to pH and cationic exchange capacity.

        <p>In coastal areas the concentration of Nd found in the coast of Havaii (Kona) and the coast of Australia (Labrador beach), revealed concentrations of Nd in seawater of 24-32 µg/L (Adeel et al., 2019).In coastal areas the concentration of Nd found in the coast of Havaii (Kona) and the coast of Australia (Labrador beach), revealed concentrations of Nd in seawater of 24-32 µg/L (Adeel et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>The increase concentration of Nd in aquatic systems may have significant impacts in the organisms inhabiting these systems. Asian continent, namely in China, shows the most critical risk of REEs pollution level followed by Europe, Africa, USA and Australia (Adeel et al., 2019). However, there are only few papers published regarding this thematic. Wang et al. (2011) evaluated the effect of Nd on a freshwater cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, specifically on its growth and biochemical changes. The results showed that Nd(III) concentration ≤1 mg/L can stimulate the growth of M. aeruginosa; also, the content of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), soluble protein and the activity of antioxidant defences increased when compared with the control.The increase concentration of Nd in aquatic systems may have significant impacts in the organisms inhabiting these systems.

It was also studied the Nd effects on rat (liver), and the results showed an accumulation in hepatocyte nuclei and mitochondria, a decrease of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and CAT, and an increase of the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and lipid peroxidation levels (Adeel et al., 2019;Rim et al., 2013). Regardless of the increasing presence of Nd in oceans and consequently bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms, there are only a few toxicological studies on organisms published in the literature. Also, those studies evaluate the effects on freshwater organisms, but Nd discharged by the industries will reach the oceans.aeruginosa was inhibited while increasing the content of malondiadehyde (MDA) and decreased the activity of the enzyme catalase (CAT).

        <p>Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the biological effects induced by Nd in the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis, through the exposure of the organisms to five different concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 µg/L of Nd), during twenty-eight days. For this, biomarkers related with oxidative stress, redox balance and metabolic status were measured in M. galloprovincialis, trying to identify potential impacts of Nd on this species.Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the biological effects induced by Nd in the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis, through the exposure of the organisms to five different concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 µg/L of Nd), during twenty-eight days.

        <p>Nevertheless, the present study further revealed the capacity of mussels to limit the accumulation of Nd, as similar accumulation rate was observed in all tested treatments, regardless the concentration of exposure. These results may indicate that, along the increasing exposure gradient, mussels were able to limit the Nd accumulation by reducing filtration and respiration capacity and/or were able to increase the detoxification of this element. Since, higher metabolic capacity was observed in contaminated mussels and no differences were observed among these treatments (except for the lowest Nd concentration), the results obtained may indicate that respiration and filtration rates were not decreased under the exposure of Nd. Therefore, the efforts of mussels to limit Nd accumulation may result from mussel's detoxification capacity.Nevertheless, the present study further revealed the capacity of mussels to limit the accumulation of Nd, as similar accumulation rate was observed in all tested treatments, regardless the concentration of exposure.

        <p>Similarly, Oliveira et al. ( 2017) demonstrated that M. galloprovincialis decreased bioconcentration factor (BCF) along the increasing exposure gradient of carbamazepine (CBZ).

        <p>Except for the lowest tested concentration (2.5 µg/L), mussels exposed to Nd significantly increased their metabolic capacity compared to non-contaminated organisms under control condition (Figure 1A). However, except for the lowest Nd concentration, higher electron transport system (ETS) values compared to control organisms did not vary among tested treatments, which may explain similar BCF values in concentrations higher than 2.5 µg/L. As mentioned above, as a result of similar metabolic capacity among different exposure concentrations, mussels may have presented similar filtration rates which led to a similar accumulation rate among different tested conditions. It was already demonstrated that ETS activity may be used as an indication of metabolic activity in marine macrofauna (Cammen et al., 1990), and an increase in bivalves ETS activity was already identified as a protective behavior, associated with the activation of defense mechanisms under pollution exposure, including the increase of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes. In particular, different authors already demonstrated that marine bivalves (Ruditapes philippinarum and M. galloprovincialis) increased their metabolic capacity, measured by ETS activity, when in the presence of nanoparticles (multi-walled carbon nanotubes) and drugs (salicylic acid) (De Marchi et al., 2018;Freitas et al., 2019). Nevertheless, several other studies addressing the metabolic capacity of bivalves under pollution stress evidenced a decrease on ETS activity, which was associated to a decrease in the filtration rate to prevent pollutants accumulation (among others, Almeida et al., 2015;Oliveira et al., 2017). Also, a previous study with other REE (Gadolinium, Gd) but testing a similar concentration range (between 15 and 60 µg/L) and the same exposure period (twentyeight days), showed that the ETS activity in M. galloprovincialis decreased significantly after the experimental period (Henriques et al., 2019). Such findings may indicate higher toxicity of Nd in comparison to other pollutants, as mussels under higher stress conditions may increase their metabolic capacity to fight against the stressful condition.Except for the lowest tested concentration (2.5 µg/L), mussels exposed to Nd significantly increased their metabolic capacity compared to non-contaminated organisms under control condition (Figure 1A).

        <p>Therefore, considering the results obtained and previous studies with bivalves exposed to pollutants we can hypothesize that up to certain stress levels bivalves are able to decrease their metabolism for short periods of time, to avoid accumulation of pollutants and reduce their toxic impacts. This strategy can seriously affect bivalves physiological and biochemical performance, being tolerable for a limited period of time. Therefore, it seems that at higher stressful conditions this strategy is no longer valid and organisms increase their ETS activity to activate defense mechanisms, which results into higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondrial electron transport system, with negative impacts on organism's cellular oxidative status.Therefore, considering the results obtained and previous studies with bivalves exposed to pollutants we can hypothesize that up to certain stress levels bivalves are able to decrease their metabolism for short periods of time, to avoid accumulation of pollutants and reduce their toxic impacts.

        <p>As a consequence of higher metabolic activity, the results obtained showed that associated with higher ETS activity contaminated organisms presented significantly lower glycogen (GLY) content in comparison to control mussels (Figure 1B). These findings evidence the need of mussels to use their energy reserves to fuel up defense mechanisms. Previous studies conducted by Lagadic et al. (1994) already suggested that energy reserves could be considered as biomarkers reflecting sublethal changes from a stressful xenobiotic exposure. Also Pellerin-Massicotte et al.

        <p>The results obtained further demonstrated that although the GLY content decreased in contaminated mussels compared to control ones, the protein (PROT) content was maintained regardless the Nd concentration of exposure, with no significant differences among tested conditions (Figure 1C).

        <p>Nevertheless, previous studies with REE showed that M. galloprovincilais were able to increase the PROT content in the presence of an increasing concentration gradient of Gd and Lanthanum (La) (Henriques et al., 2019;Pinto et al., 2019), which could be related to the capacity of mussels to increase production of enzymes to fight against the stress induced, indicating also that in this case mussels were experiencing a mild stress condition with no need to use PROT as energy source while being able to enhance the production of enzymes.Nevertheless, previous studies with REE showed that M. galloprovincilais were able to increase the PROT content in the presence of an increasing concentration gradient of Gd and Lanthanum (La) (Henriques et al., 2019;Pinto et al., 2019), which could be related to the capacity of mussels to increase production of enzymes to fight against the stress induced, indicating also that in this case mussels were experiencing a mild stress condition with no need to use PROT as energy source while being able to enhance the production of enzymes.</p>
        <p>Overall, the results obtained evidenced that under Nd exposure mussels increased their metabolic capacity, probably to fuel up defense mechanisms (namely antioxidant enzymes activity), which was accompanied by expenditure of GLY reserves but not a decrease in PROT content.

        <p>In terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, the results obtained showed no significant differences among conditions except for the lowest Nd concentration where the activity of this enzyme was significantly higher compared to the remaining conditions (Figure 2A). In the case of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), at the highest exposure concentration no significant differences were observed to control organisms, while at the remaining exposure concentrations significantly lower activity was recorded compared to control and the highest concentration (Figure 2B). On the contrary, mussels exposed to Nd tended to increase their catalase (CAT) activity, which was significantly higher at concentrations 5.0, 10 and 40 µg/L compared to the remaining conditions (Figure 2C). It is well known that when in the presence of a stressful condition, including the presence of pollutants, organisms may increase the production of ROS. To avoid damages caused by ROS (including lipid peroxidation, protein carbonilation and DNA damage), organisms may increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Among these enzymes are SOD, GPx and CAT that have the capacity to eliminate ROS (namely, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide), preventing organisms from cellular damages. Nevertheless, this response normally occurs when oxidative stress is not very high or very long-during. On the other hand, when exposed to extremely high stressful conditions or if the stress is persisting, the proteins damage became profound and a decrease of these enzymes activity may occur (either via direct oxidative damage of the enzymes molecules, or via oxidative stress-altered enzymes gene expression, or both). Among others, Manduzio et al. (2004) hypothesized that the over production of ROS inhibited the SOD activity in Mytilus edulis collected from a polluted area. Studies conducted by Matozzo et al.

        <p>philippinarum clams observed might be due to the oxidation of the enzyme SH groups mediated by ROS, which production is increased by Cu (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1984). In accordance to this, the present study may indicate that mussels were exposed to high toxic conditions since the results obtained showed that M. galloprovincialis exposed to Nd were not able to significantly increase their antioxidant defenses, namely in terms of SOD and GPx activity, which was especially noticed at higher exposure concentrations. This behaviour may have limited mussel's capacity to eliminate the excess of ROS generated by the presence of this element. Nevertheless, one of the three antioxidant enzymes analyzed seemed to be sensitive to some of the treatments, which can suggest not only a complex mode of action of this element but also that not all the mechanisms involved in the onset of oxidative stress due to Nd have been investigated.philippinarum clams observed might be due to the oxidation of the enzyme SH groups mediated by ROS, which production is increased by Cu (Halliwell and Gutteridge, 1984).

        <p>Furthermore, the results obtained may also evidence that increased metabolic capacity was not enough to significantly activate antioxidant enzymes and increased ETS activity also contributed to the generation of higher ROS amount.

Such results can, once again, corroborate the hypothesis that Nd may be more toxic than Gd towards M. galloprovincialis, exposed to a similar concentration range.Furthermore, the results obtained may also evidence that increased metabolic capacity was not enough to significantly activate antioxidant enzymes and increased ETS activity also contributed to the generation of higher ROS amount.

These results may result from the fact that mussels were not able to efficiently activate antioxidant enzymes, resulting into cellular damages in the presence of Nd.

Although a high diversity of studies already showed that the presence of metals, nanoparticles and drugs may originate increased LPO levels in bivalves even if antioxidant enzymes were activated (see for example, Freitas et al., 2019bFreitas et al., , 2019a;;McCarthy et al., 2013;Monteiro et al., 2019;Vlahogianni and Valavanidis, 2007), less studies demonstrated the occurrence of LPO when bivalves are exposed REE. In particular, Henriques et al. (2019) demonstrated that when M.</p>
        <p>The ratio between reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione was significantly lower in mussels exposed to Nd in comparison to non-exposed ones, with no significant differences among contaminated mussels (Figure 4B). Such results clearly reveal that GSH content decreased while GSSG increased in contaminated mussels, indicating loss of redox homeostasis in organisms exposed to Nd and the high demand for GSTs. To eliminate the excess of ROS generated by a stress condition, besides antioxidant enzymatic defenses, organisms further present low molecular scavengers that are also to neutralize ROS by direct reaction with them, being GSH the most abundant. In its reduced form, GSH, glutathione is capable of scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, thereby contributing to the control of redox homoeostasis.The ratio between reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione was significantly lower in mussels exposed to Nd in comparison to non-exposed ones, with no significant differences among contaminated mussels (Figure 4B).

        <p>Therefore, the glutathione system acts as the major redox buffer in the majority of cells (Couto et al., 2016). In the presence of ROS, GSH can be oxidized into GSSG and, thus, under stressful conditions the ratio GSH/GSSG tends to decrease as a result of GSSG increase. Organisms which use glutathione for redox homoeostasis are able to synthesize reduced glutathione, but they are also characterized by their ability to recycle glutathione. Glutathione reductase (GRed) is an essential enzyme that recycles oxidised glutathione back to the reduced form (Couto et al., 2016). Thus, the increased content of GSSG observed by lower GSH/GSSG levels in contaminated mussels indicates that GRed failed to oxidize glutathione into its reduced form. The ratio GSH/GSSG is often used to assess the oxidative stress of organisms exposed to pollutants (e.g. Peña-Llopis et al., 2002;Almeida et al., 2015;Sellami et al., 2015;Freitas et al., 2018;2019).Therefore, the glutathione system acts as the major redox buffer in the majority of cells (Couto et al., 2016).

        <p>Also, after exposure to Nd, mussels showed inefficient antioxidant and biotransformation strategies, leading to cellular damage and loss of redox balance provoked by the excess of ROS, namely as a result of higher electron transport system activity. Considering that tested concentrations resemble low to highly polluted areas, the results here presented highlight the hazardous capacity of Nd towards M. galloprovincialis. Toxic effects observed at individual level may result into negative impacts to mussel's population as changes observed at cellular level may result into impairments on organism's survival, growth, abundance and reproduction capacity.Also, after exposure to Nd, mussels showed inefficient antioxidant and biotransformation strategies, leading to cellular damage and loss of redox balance provoked by the excess of ROS, namely as a result of higher electron transport system activity.
