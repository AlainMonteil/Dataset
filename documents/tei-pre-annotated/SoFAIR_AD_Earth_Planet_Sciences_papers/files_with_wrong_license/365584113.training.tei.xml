        <p>The key aim of this report is to show how the forest sector can help the Russian Federation to meet its Paris Agreement targets and, at the same time, how the sector can contribute to improve the economy. This is linked to building an innovative strategy of sustainable forest management, addressing conservation as well as productivity, emphasizing the country's aims of low carbon society, boosting the investment sector on forest products and introducing technical innovation measures of the bioeconomy, as represented by new and emerging wood-based products.The key aim of this report is to show how the forest sector can help the Russian Federation to meet its Paris Agreement targets and, at the same time, how the sector can contribute to improve the economy.

        <p>We provide a systematic analysis of the Russian Federation's forest resources; their potential for carbon sequestration and contribution to the Paris Agreement targets; the impacts of climate change; and the risks associated with biotic and abiotic disturbances. We also present three regional case studies with varying degrees of opportunities and solutions for protecting forest resources and enhancing ecosystem services both for carbon sequestration and for wood-based products, using the framework of Climate Smart Forestry (CSF). We also look at the climate change mitigation potential and opportunities arising from forest bioeconomy and the transformation of Russia towards a low carbon society including various innovative solutions for new wood-based products and industrial sectors. This report synthesizes the current scientific understanding on Russian forests and climate change, and identified the opportunities as well as challenges with respect to adaptation, mitigation and bioeconomy. The key findings and recommendations for the next steps can be summarized as follows:We provide a systematic analysis of the Russian Federation's forest resources; their potential for carbon sequestration and contribution to the Paris Agreement targets; the impacts of climate change; and the risks associated with biotic and abiotic disturbances.

        <p>In addition to the Paris Agreement, the fight against climate change is part of a more comprehensive challenge, which is grounded on the Agenda 2030 and its transformative approach to sustainable development.

        <p>Russia was persistent and rather successful in promoting the role of forests during the negotiations of the Paris Agreement. As indicated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), the Russian Federation has committed to limit 2030 emissions to 75% of 1990 levels, under the condition of full accounting of forest carbon sinks (from the current emission level of approx. 50% below 1990). The overall Paris Agreement target of reaching climate neutrality in the 21 st century calls for ambitious mitigation goals, in which forest sinks can play a significant role. It is therefore important to understand in detail what the opportunities and challenges for the role of Russian forests could be in implementing the Paris Agreement. This holds true with future development of forest ecosystems and forest management, as well as the required transformation of society and its decarbonisation. Overall, the aim is to secure the sustainability of forest ecosystem service provisioning and at the same time, maintain economic opportunities and well-being.Russia was persistent and rather successful in promoting the role of forests during the negotiations of the Paris Agreement.

        <p>'Natural climate solutions' (Griscom et al., 2017) have been suggested as important means to mitigate climate change that can contribute up to 37% (23.8 Pg CO 2 eq. / year) of the required global emissions reduction by 2030. Approximately two-thirds of the total mitigation potential from these natural climate solutions could be achieved by storing carbon in forest ecosystems (Griscom et al., 2017;Roe et al., 2019) and the rest with material substitution. However, forests, which are the primary source for non-food and non-feed renewable biological resources globally, are under unprecedented pressure from climate extremes, as manifested by the increase of forest fires, storm damages and pest outbreaks. Climate change is expected to further exacerbate these disturbances, together with other impacts on forests and soils, such as productivity changes, tree species changing, permafrost thawing, etc. There is thus a need to adapt to the impacts of climate change in addition to mitigating climate change. Adaptation is needed for forest resilience and for continuing to provide ecosystem services to the society. As Russia has such vast, and partly remote, forest resources, it is important not only to mitigate climate change but also to reduce or prevent related disturbances, which may push the overall carbon balance of Russian forests from being a sink to a source of carbon.'Natural climate solutions' (Griscom et al., 2017) have been suggested as important means to mitigate climate change that can contribute up to 37% (23.8 Pg CO 2 eq. / year) of the required global emissions reduction by 2030.

        <p>There is a need for new, more efficient approaches to forestry and forest management and planning.

        <p>The term "forest resources" is used in many ways in Russian forest literature. In a narrow, product-oriented sense, forest resources include the growing stock volume and non-timber products in forests and other land covered by tree and shrub vegetation (Moiseev, 1974). In a wider sense, forest resources refer to forested areas, including all biotic components (plants, animals, fungi, microorganisms) on land as well as their associated features that create forest environments and a broad range of products and services (Sheingauz and Sapozhnikov, 1983).The term "forest resources" is used in many ways in Russian forest literature.

        <p>Such areas may meet the criteria of the national forest definition, but they are excluded from official forest inventories.

        <p>The average share of forest cover on the total Russian land area has been rather stable during the last decades, currently it is 46.5% (IIASA, unpublished data). However, forest cover varies strongly by region and bioclimatic zone, from 0.2% (Republic of Kalmykia) to 82.5% (Irkutsk oblast). Around two-thirds of all the forests in the Russian Federation are growing on permafrost, which is widely spread in Siberia and the Russian Far East.The average share of forest cover on the total Russian land area has been rather stable during the last decades, currently it is 46.5% (IIASA, unpublished data).

        <p>The forested area per capita is high, at 5.30 ha for the whole of Russia, with variation from 0.03 ha (Stavropol kray) to 162.2 ha (Republic of Sakha) (Figure 2). It is the highest in North-Eastern Russia (Republic of Sakha, Chukotka autonomous okrug, Magadan oblast and Kamchatka kray) due to very low population density. Overall, regions with high population densities have lower availability of forest resources, the lowest values are in the southern half of the European part of Russia. The most important forest resource indicator is growing stock volume (GSV). The total GSV of all Russian forests, according to the SFR 2016 data, was 82.8 billion m 3 of which 79.7 billion m 3 were in forests of Several studies report that growing stock volumes in Russian forests were underestimated by ground forest inventory by at least 10-20% (Shvidenko et al., 2007;Vyvodtsev et al., 2003). Different forest disturbances are often inter-linked and may have strong linkages to climate factors and human activity. Drought, for example, often triggers insect outbreaks in addition to its direct impacts on forests, and both factors may lead to increasing fuel amounts and higher risk of fires. These forest disturbances are also affected by climate change. Humans influence their natural regimes directly (by inducing and/or suppressing fires, insect outbreaks, etc.) and indirectly by altering the environmental conditions.The forested area per capita is high, at 5.30 ha for the whole of Russia, with variation from 0.03 ha (Stavropol kray) to 162.2 ha (Republic of Sakha) (Figure 2).

        <p>Compared to the global trend of declining burnt area over the last two decades (Andela et al., 2017), Russian forests are prone to accelerated extent, frequency and severity of wildfires and other natural disturbances, such as insect outbreaks. There are a number of reasons for this, including 1) dominance of highly flammable coniferous forests, 2) increasing risk of lightning-caused fires, particularly in sparsely populated remote territories, 3) unsatisfactory forest protection against fire and biogenic disturbances, and 4) overall decline of forest management and governance.Compared to the global trend of declining burnt area over the last two decades (Andela et al., 2017), Russian forests are prone to accelerated extent, frequency and severity of wildfires and other natural disturbances, such as insect outbreaks.

        <p>Fire impacts on tree dieback depend on many factors, including fire types (crown, ground or underground) and severity, tree species composition and age, fire occurrence over the season and meteorological conditions. Since the 1950s, on average over the country, ground fires constituted 77%, with 22% crown fires, and 1% reported as peat fires (Korovin, 1996). The MODIS-derived estimates of the area of stand-replacing fires (Figure 3) ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 mill. ha between 2006 and 2019 with tendency to increase (Bartalev et al., 2015;Bartalev personal communication).Fire impacts on tree dieback depend on many factors, including fire types (crown, ground or underground) and severity, tree species composition and age, fire occurrence over the season and meteorological conditions.

In the European-Ural part of Russia the share of human induced fires is higher (93.5%), while in the Asian part their share is estimated at 77% compared to 19% of lightning ignitions. The average area of lightning induced fires is about three times higher compared to human induced ones, and the share of lightning induced fire areas is approximately 40% in the forest protection zone.It is important to note that while forest fires are generally considered a natural phenomenon in boreal forests, the majority of fire ignitions in Russia are human induced. cause (Korovin and Zukkert, 2003).

        <p>The direct fire carbon emissions are estimated at 40 to 90 Mt C /year (Shvidenko et al. 2013a, Shvidenko andSchepaschenko 2014). The average composition of combustion products in 2000-2012 was: CO 2 -84.6%, CO -8.2%, CH 4 -1.1%, non-methane hydrocarbons -1.2%, organic carbon 1.2%, and black carbon -0.1%. The highest content of CH 4 and CO in the combustion products is observed in emissions from peat fires (Shvidenko et al., 2011). Significant emissions are also observed in forests due to postfire dieback after non-stand-replacing fires which may last from 2 to 8 years.

        <p>However, with increased warming, outbreaks may occur in the forests north of this line. From 1880 to 1969, about 13 mill. ha of East Siberian forests were destroyed by the Siberian silk moth (Dendrolimus sibiricus), representing a loss of 2 billion m 3 of growing stock (Shvidenko et al., 2013b). Insect outbreaks heavily damaged more than 1 mill. ha in the mid-1990s and affected an area of more than 10 mill. ha of Northern larch forests in 2000-2001 in latitudes where this insect had rarely been observed before (Shvidenko et al., 2013b).However, with increased warming, outbreaks may occur in the forests north of this line.

        <p>The protective role of Russian forests is manifold. Of the 17 protective forest categories covering an area of 278.3 mill. ha (SFR, 2014), three categories are directly destined for water protection and regulation: spawning protection strips (56.8 mill. ha), water protective zones (11.1 mill. ha), and protective strips along water objects (28.0 mill. ha) with a special regime of forest management for the maintenance and improvement of hydrological regimes of water flows. Recent changes to the Forest Code introduced in 2019, however, may have a negative impact the protective functions of the Russian forests. For example, the width of spawning protection strips was reduced from 1 km and more to only 20-200 m (Kobyakov et al., 2018).The protective role of Russian forests is manifold.

Numerous inverse modelling studies estimated a land carbon sink around 600-720 Mt C /year (Sitch et al. 2015;Shvidenko, Schepaschenko 2014); eddy covariance flux measurements at 15 sites indicated a carbon sink in a range from 760-960 Mt C /year (Dolman et al., 2012) and estimates of dynamical vegetation models (DGVMs) project a sink at around 200 Mt C /year (Dolman et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>It is also pointed out that the uncertainty of soil carbon assessment is high (Pan et al., 2011) and soil model simulations showed that water table fluctuation in boreal forests could play a key role in determining the source/sink behaviour of the ecosystem carbon balance (Kurbatova et al., 2008).It is also pointed out that the uncertainty of soil carbon assessment is high (Pan et al., 2011) and soil model simulations showed that water table fluctuation in boreal forests could play a key role in determining the source/sink behaviour of the ecosystem carbon balance (Kurbatova et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>Methodological differences and inconsistent input data can explain large parts of the variation between published carbon budget assessments on Russian forests. The forest or land area reference varies; for example, the official UNFCCC reporting based on SFR data covers only around 75% of the total Russian forest area (i.e. only managed forests). Atmospheric inversions cover all land areas and cannot separate the forest carbon sink from other land uses. Measurements from eddy covariance towers cover also different land uses and may calculate higher carbon sinks than other methods because management and natural disturbance effects are not accounted for. Further differences relate to the representation of important ecosystem processes and disturbances. Many studies neglect the dynamics of soil carbon and disturbance impacts are often incomplete. Estimates of the impacts of biogenic disturbances are highly uncertain and often missing entirely.Methodological differences and inconsistent input data can explain large parts of the variation between published carbon budget assessments on Russian forests.

        <p>With high probability, Russian forests served as a significant net carbon sink during the last decades. Temporal and spatial variability of the carbon sink is high, particularly for individual regions of the country. The temporal variability is mainly caused by interannual variability of seasonal weather and, connected to this, the natural disturbances like fire and insect outbreaks. Despite the average sink, there are vast areas, mostly in disturbed forests and on permafrost, which acted as a carbon source or are close to the neutral state (Figure 10). The regional differences are affected by variable forest productivity and disturbance regimes as well as underlying differences in population density and related factors such as management intensity, infrastructure and accessibility and fire protection as discussed in Chapters 2.1 and 2.2. The last decade showed a weak trend of a decreasing carbon sink due to frequent and large disturbances, especially large fires. More detailed analysis points out that during the current century, carbon sink dynamics in Russian forests had no statistically significant trend until 2017. But the high level of disturbances in 2018, 2019 and 2020 reached unprecedented levels and once these years are included in the analysis, they will likely result in a substantial decrease of the Russian forest carbon sink. Observations of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (2020) indicated that wildfire related CO 2 emissions for the Arctic cycle during January to August 2020 already exceeded the previous record for annual emissions set in the year 2019, mainly driven by the exceptionally large wildfires in Sakha Republic, Northeastern Russia.With high probability, Russian forests served as a significant net carbon sink during the last decades.

        <p>The most fundamental challenge in Russian forestry is the need to replace the exploitative forest use with sustainable intensive forest management (see Box 2).

        <p>Industrial-scale forest use since the Soviet era is dominated by an extensive exploitative model of forest use, aiming at maximizing income with only limited interventions (Konzepzia, 2015). The system applies clear cut harvesting, continuously extending into new forest territories, and is characterised by harvest of most productive and accessible stands, an incomplete use of wood of lower quality and less valuable tree species, natural non-assisted regeneration, and a lack of tending in young stands. Thinning or rather selective cutting in young and middle-aged stands was insufficiently performed. As a result, the quality of forest resources degraded with undesirable change of species composition and a decreasing volume of economically accessible forest resources (Knize and Romanuk, 2004;Konzepzia, 2015). Official data document that the share of coniferous species decreased while softwood species share increased substantially in forested area during 1961-2016(Forest State Account for 1961-2007, State Forest Register for 2008-2016). Harvest usage has been much higher in densely populated regions and there is a lack of high value timber in regions of high demand. For instance, the share of coniferous forests decreased in this period from 89.8% to 76.3% in Arkhagelsk oblast (European North-West) and from 86.5 to 70.8% in Amur oblast (Far East). Even more drastic is the decreasing area of economically accessible mature forests (Sokolov and Baginsky, 2014), which could be exhausted in the North-West Federal District during the next 20 years (Moiseev, 2008). The ratio of forest regeneration to areas of final felling dropped from 147% in 2000 to 74% in 2016 (Strategy, 2018), which implies that successful forest regeneration is increasingly delayed or even fails after harvest operations.Industrial-scale forest use since the Soviet era is dominated by an extensive exploitative model of forest use, aiming at maximizing income with only limited interventions (Konzepzia, 2015).

        <p>Against this background, it is increasingly evident that there is a need for new developments and innovative solutions for forestry practices. Over the last fifteen years, a concept of intensive forest management has been increasingly debated among national experts from science, business community and environmental organizations in Russia. In 2015, the "Concept of intensive use and restoration of forests in the Russian Federation" was approved by the Federal Forestry Agency and started to be implemented in pilot regions of North-West Russia and Eastern Siberia (Konzepzia, 2015). The intensive model implies sustainable forest management and ensures the preservation of the biological functions of forests through effective reforestation, tending of young stands and regular thinnings. This chapter shows a synthesis of the past, present and future of climate change in the Russian Federation on a physical and geographical basis. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the analysis of the impacts of changes in the physical climate on the forest sector.Against this background, it is increasingly evident that there is a need for new developments and innovative solutions for forestry practices.

        <p>Recent scientifically documented changes in climate have impacts on all climatic features, including temperature, precipitation, wind, and cloudiness. The regional changes can differ from global trends and Russia presents a good example for this, as the average annual temperature anomaly in the whole country has reached about 1.6 °C, which is much higher than the global anomaly of 0.9 °C compared to pre-industrial time (Allen et al., 2018).

Similar dieback processes occurred in fir stands in the Krasnoyarsk kray since 2010, caused by an extreme drought followed by invasion of Sakhalin-fir bark beetle, which was not earlier observed in the region (Kharuk et al., 2019).</p>

However, tree species distribution shifts may be modulated through changes in land use as forest area increase through the north and eastward expansion of boreal forests into the tundra (ranging between 7-12% depending on the scenario) could be compensated through encroachment of competing land uses such as agricultural or bioenergy crops into forest areas (Kicklighter et al., 2014).The The vegetation period at the end of the century (2090-2099) was projected to lengthen by 25 and 41 days on average across Russia compared to the 1990-1999 period under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, leading to a decline of coniferous and increased shares of deciduous trees (Torzhkov et al., 2019).

        <p>In combination, climate change-induced shifts in species ranges and forest disturbances could affect forest dynamics and functioning more than indicated by individual assessments. The boreal forests of the northern hemisphere have been identified as a tipping element in the global climate system (Lenton et al., 2008). Strong, drought-driven tree mortality interacting with increasing insect and fire disturbances may further increase the susceptibility of forests to large-scale dieback under global warming levels above 3°C global warming (Lenton et al., 2008;Schellnhuber et al., 2016). It is unclear whether the projected disturbance dynamics assessed in this chapter interact at a scale that could result in irreversible forest loss. However, they clearly reach beyond past experiences with increasing risk of unprecedented adverse impacts on forests. Moreover, satellite data analyses suggests that the boreal region contains ecosystems with multiple stable states, meaning that climate-driven vegetation shifts could be abrupt rather than smooth and forests may abruptly switch to a sparsely vegetated ecosystem state and to a certain extend also vice versa (Scheffer et al., 2012). Such transitions to more open vegetation would have important implications for the global carbon cycle and other climate-vegetation feedbacks by reducing the ecosystem carbon stocks, increasing surface roughness and reducing reflectance. However, the feedbacks on carbon cycling and climate feedbacks of such land-cover changes is yet to be assessed and can further amplify warming if for example wetlands or peatlands are invaded by trees (Moomaw et al., 2018). Overall, the evidence for a boreal forest tipping point (Lenton et al., 2008) is ambiguous, but current evidence rather points at an increase of disturbance impacts destabilizing the forests, with less indications supporting an increase in tree cover. These results are consistent with projections from regional studies and larger ensembles w h at s c i e n c e c a n t e l l u s of global vegetation models that also show mostly increasing NPP in boreal regions even under high levels of global warming (Kurbatova and Tarko, 2017;Friend et al., 2014, Ito et al. 2020)).

        <p>One main issue is whether the simulated productivity increase that can be largely attributed to very strong responses of vegetation productivity to increasing levels of atmospheric CO 2 in the models, is realistic. Recently, model and observational studies have disputed the continuous, ubiquitous effects of CO 2 fertilization (Hickler et al., 2015;Jiang et al., 2020). To account for this uncertainty, Figure 18 shows sensitivity simulations of projected NPP changes under RCP8.5 for the 2036-2065 and 2070-2099 period without including further beneficial effects of CO 2 . In these simulations, the projected NPP changes show a much more marked pattern: NPP still increases in Central and Eastern Siberia while it strongly decreases in the Southern and Western parts of Russia (Figure 18 lower right panel). Another issue is that the models only account to a very limited extent for large-scale forest disturbances such as fire or insect damage. While fire interactions are included to some extent, none of the models includes dynamic simulations of damages from insects or storms. However, even with these deficiencies, the models simulate large changes in carbon residence time, which essentially means a faster turnover of vegetation because of higher mortality due to drought and other factors (Friend et al., 2014). Finally, the models do not include forest management effects nor are the actual species distributions as influenced by forest management prescribed. The projected increases in NPP have to be considered at the backdrop of these limited representations of forest dynamics and management. Hence, even though the models adequately represent changes in forest productivity in line with ecological theory, it is important to note that the models largely ignore management and disturbance effects on productivity, biomass and carbon stocks.One main issue is whether the simulated productivity increase that can be largely attributed to very strong responses of vegetation productivity to increasing levels of atmospheric CO 2 in the models, is realistic.

        <p>Another group of forest simulation models accounts for changes in forest management and enables studying different forest management scenarios. However, they usually do not consider the effects of changing climate on productivity. Zamolodchikov et al. (2013Zamolodchikov et al.

The "intense" scenario suggests a rise of harvests until allowable cuts are reached separately for Russian administrative regions and reforestation activities were assumed to be proportional to ing to earlier harvests. After the mid-century the sink increased again when the previously harvested forest started to regrow. Forest product stores (but no substitution effects; see more on substitution from Chapters 5 and 6 of this report) were accounted for in the analyses but represented only a small carbon stock that could not balance increasing carbon losses from decay. 1961-1990; 1986-2015; 2036-2065; 2070-2099). The map in the upper left shows the multi model mean NPP over 1961-1990 as simulated by the 2 DGVMs under different historical climate forcing from the 4 GCMs. The map in the upper right as well as the middle and lower maps show changes in the multi model mean relative to the 1961-1990 period from an ensemble of 2 DGVMs and 4 Global Climate Models driven by the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenario for the period (1986-2015; 2036-2065; 2070-2099). w h at s c i e n c e c a n t e l l u s activities showed that forest management had a stronger influence than climate on forest carbon dynamics (Shanin et al., 2011).

        <p>The risks for forests will be the highest in hotspot regions exposed to major direct (high summer temperature, water stress) and indirect (accompanied disturbances) drivers. The highest risks for forest survival are expected at the transition zones between forests and treeless areas at the northern and particularly southern limits of the forest zone. Forests in the southern taiga zone and at mid-latitude forest steppe ecotones are particularly vulnerable due to water stress (Tchebakova et al., 2009), with particular risks for biodiversity, wild fauna and livelihood of the local population (e.g. Tchebakova et al., 2009;Kharuk et al., 2017a). Shifting species distribution ranges (see Chapters 4.1 and 4.2) substantially enhance vulnerability of forests due to disparity between the rate of natural tree migration in the high latitudes -less than 100 m per year (Aitken et al., 2008), compared with the northward shift of climatic conditions that is 10 to 50 times faster (Thuiller 2007).

Also, social and economic changes in Russia after the 1990s have led to the slow death of several thousands of taiga villages located around former industrial facilities. The remaining population in these settlements is almost completely depending on forests. Moreover, large parts of the regional population in forested regions is vulnerable to extreme weather events and accompanying catastrophic disturbances because of inadequate forest fire protection and weak capacity and preparedness in disturbance risk management. This may lead to critical health impacts, premature deaths of thousands of people, and large economic losses (Bastos et al., 2014;Shvidenko et al., 2020).Vulnerability of forests also affects people.

        <p>Vulnerability of Russia's forests to disturbances represents the most dangerous current and particularly future risk. Regional disturbance regimes are projected to intensify, as extent, frequency and severity of wildfires and outbreaks of dangerous insects and pathogens substantially increase. It is very likely that the vulnerability of mid-latitude forests of Eurasia will be critically magnified by diverse dangerous biotic agents including alien insects and pathogens. While local reasons of observed resilience decline and death of forests differ (e.g. periods with severe drought, invasions of insects and pathogens, changes of the hydrological regime, planting forests in inappropriate conditions, lack of satisfactory forest management), there is increasing evidence that all these processes have been directly or indirectly affected by climatic and environmental changes (Shvidenko et al., 2017). Consequently, a tipping point of boreal forests may be reached under lower levels of warming than earlier anticipated (Lenton et al., 2019). Recent experiences question the ability of current national forest management systems including legislation and forest management manuals, institutional structure, and forest protection capacities to meet the challenges of the fast-changing world.Vulnerability of Russia's forests to disturbances represents the most dangerous current and particularly future risk.

        <p>Vulnerable forests lead to a high vulnerability of the Russian forest industry. The most valuable tree species for the Russian forest industry are pine and spruce, which are also very vulnerable to climate change. Catastrophic fires and insect outbreaks have in recent decades completely destroyed highly productive forests on hundreds of thousands of hectares which were then regenerated by early successional species of lower economic value. A crucial problem for the Russian forest sector is the poor transport infrastructure, especially the lack of all-season roads (Goltsev at al., 2011). In most regions with abundant forest resources, logging companies can access remote forest areas only during wintertime. The logging and transport of wood heavily depend on weather conditions.

Elements for a new system of forest fire protection should include the analysis of present and future regional fire regimes and the development and implementation of more efficient forest fire protection concepts. This requires appropriate adaptation of forest landscapes to future climate conditions (adapted species composition, land cover and forest structure, control of fuel amount, etc.), the development of efficient fire monitoring and creation of mobile systems of fire suppression, improving the legislation and institutional structures of forest management, and better international cooperation (Mokhov et al., 2006;Malevsky-Malevich et al., 2008;Shvidenko and Schepaschenko, 2013).

        <p>Therefore, measures would often have to rely on air support and techniques that could cover large areas in a relatively short time window. Tree seeding from aircraft could be a tool, as well as the use of aerial ignition for large scale prescribed burning to reduce available fuel loads before the fire season. A proven technique to burn so-called "open-ended fire breaks" using aerial ignition has been developed in Australia and Southern Africa (de Bruno Austin et al., 2011). Research would be needed to adapt such techniques and tools to Russian conditions to create strategically placed large fire breaks / fuel buffer zones in the extensive Russian forests. This is easier said than done and extensive training would be needed to create and enable fire managers to apply fire skilfully.Therefore, measures would often have to rely on air support and techniques that could cover large areas in a relatively short time window.

We excluded impacts of soils as effects were considered too uncertain (e.g. soil models typically focus on mineral soils and do not cover the carbon dynamics in organic soils (peatlands) very well). We have also excluded the bioenergy component as in these three regions there is hardly a commercial (e.g. pellet) type of bioenergy.

        <p>Case study: Republic of Karelia 21). In the 1950s, intensive clear felling became the most used forest management method, leading to a lot of young forest now. Prior to this, selective logging was the most common practice. The large share in area of forests older than 100 years in the region is due to the prevalence of protective forests, low productive forests that are unattractive for wood harvesting due to difficult access. The high fraction of deciduous forests in the middle age-class is due to the lack of effective restoration of coniferous forests in the 1990s, which caused Scots pine and Norway spruce to give way to deciduous species (generally birch). The small peak in mature forest area of deciduous forests older than 60 years may be associated with large areas of abandoned agricultural land in the 1940s and 1950s.Case study: Republic of Karelia 21).

        <p>CSF scenarios 1 and 3 have a significant effect on growing stock, increment and total wood removals compared to the BAU scenario. The positive effect on growing stock and increment is mainly due to the larger share of thinnings in total wood removals and the application of improved breeding materials in both scenarios. The removal regimes of CSF scenarios 1 and 3 are the same in terms of total removal volume per time step, but CSF3 specifies different removal volumes per region. The removal is increased with 50% in the middle taiga and decreased with 50% in the northern taiga. This is visible in Figure 22c, where roundwood removal volumes for both scenarios develop similarly until the demand for removal of wood in CSF3 is not met anymore in the period 2056-2066.

        <p>The main outcome of the simulations in Karelian forests is that, even when a much higher harvest level is employed in CSF1 than in BAU, under CSF1 the increment is maintained at a significantly higher level (additionally about 0.5 m 3 /ha/year) and thus the growing stock even increases to a higher level, despite a higher harvest. The removal regimes of the BAU and CSF2 are the same in terms of total removal volume per time step, but CSF2 specifies a relatively lower removal volume from protective forests and a relatively higher volume from commercial forests. The effect of CSF2 is mainly visible in Figure 22d. The area of old growth forest (i.e. older than 150 years) on protective sites has significantly increased over the course of the 50-year time period, compared to the BAU.

        <p>A change in species composition and the annual allowable cut contributed to a decrease in the volume of harvested deciduous at a faster rate when compared to coniferous. The installation of new timber processing plants is planned for the region for the next few years, which will likely increase the competition for raw materials.

A decrease in the production of doors and windows has been observed in the past few years, but the demand is expected to increase with the development of the wood construction for housing in the region. Regarding the use of wood for energy, the active gasification of the municipal territories of the region is contributing to a decrease in demand of wood for this purpose.A change in species composition and the annual allowable cut contributed to a decrease in the volume of harvested deciduous at a faster rate when compared to coniferous.

        <p>The CSF scenario has a significant effect on growing stock and increment compared to the BAU scenario.

        <p>This measure was combined with an increased share of thinnings, regeneration with improved breeding materials and a decreased harvest level. The increment in the CSF scenario increases at a higher rate than the BAU scenario, primarily due to the application of improved breeding materials and an increased share of wood coming from thinnings. The measures in the CSF scenario lead to a more balanced age distribution, compared to the BAU scenario (see Figure 37). The carbon balance in biomass shows a carbon source in all scenarios at the start of the simulations (Figures 38 and39). This effect is due to the high harvest level, with higher removals compared to the increment. The net carbon source turns into a net sink in the CSF scenario after 25 years. In order to keep the growing stock in the forest at a stable level the harvest had to be reduced in Angara macro-district in the CSF scenario. This means less wood is available for HWP and thus additional emissions for the HWP itself and for the substitution effect as can be seen in Figure 39.This measure was combined with an increased share of thinnings, regeneration with improved breeding materials and a decreased harvest level.

        <p>Harvest levels in the Angara macro-district have increased rapidly in recent years, with a large share of the wood coming from final harvest (clearfelling). Our projections show that this harvest level cannot be sustained over a longer period of time. The stock of old growth forest shows a very small annual increment rate (estimated at approximately 1.7 m 3 /ha/year) and under the current harvesting level, the growing stock was projected to decline rapidly from 153 m 3 /ha currently to 138 m 3 /ha in 50 years.Harvest levels in the Angara macro-district have increased rapidly in recent years, with a large share of the wood coming from final harvest (clearfelling).

        <p>A measure to improve the infrastructure by constructing roads cannot be modelled in EFISCEN. The effect of a better infrastructure on wildfires are also not clear. Improved infrastructure may facilitate access to firefighters to suppress and extinguish wildfires but may also increase the risks of human-induced wildfires. On the other hand, access via roads may also increase harvesting pressure, and/or may be a prerequisite to improve forest management (Niskanen et al., 2003).A measure to improve the infrastructure by constructing roads cannot be modelled in EFISCEN.

        <p>In this chapter, we applied the CSF approach to three case studies in Russia, so as to provide insights into the climate change mitigation potential of alternative strategies while creating options for the Russian woodworking forest sector. Due to the significantly varying regional circumstances across Russia, we analysed a portfolio of CSF measures that were specific for each region and together provided climate benefits. Our results complement the study by Nabuurs et al. (2018) on CSF in three European countries. We did not follow the conventional climate accounting rules. Instead, we sum the impacts of the forests and forest sector to CO 2 mitigation as the atmosphere "sees it". If emissions are reduced, these reduced emissions are, according to current emission reporting rules reported by other sectors (e.g. the energy sector), but in our study, we attributed the wood products substitution effects to the forest sector. We did not consider bioenergy; large scale production of pellets has not started yet in these three regions.In this chapter, we applied the CSF approach to three case studies in Russia, so as to provide insights into the climate change mitigation potential of alternative strategies while creating options for the Russian woodworking forest sector.

        <p>We did not consider all possible mitigation measures and did not optimise or maximise them. Instead, we tried to design mitigation measures taking into consideration the local conditions and infrastructures and analysed their impacts by considering all carbon pools and substitution effects. These measures could include increasing harvest levels to be able to increase the resilience of forests. Drastic but needed conversions that could temporarily cause forest ecosystems to act as a source may also be part of a long-term mitigation strategy.We did not consider all possible mitigation measures and did not optimise or maximise them.

        <p>All CSF measures were implemented at a pace that was judged realistic, but still with additional effort towards climate mitigation compared to the current management. We summarise the mitigation impacts of all measures for each case study in Table 7. In all three case studies, we considered that, under CSF, forests dominated by coniferous species (pine, spruce, and larch) would be regenerated with improved breeding materials of the same species with a 25% higher growth rates. These growth gains are large, but in line with expected growth gains that are considered achievable in the Baltic and Nordic countries (Rytter et al., 2016). The introduction of better adapted tree species and improved breeding material can mainly be achieved through artificial regeneration.All CSF measures were implemented at a pace that was judged realistic, but still with additional effort towards climate mitigation compared to the current management.

        <p>However, natural regeneration is the dominant means of forest regeneration in the three case studies at the moment. This leads to increases in areas of birch and aspen, of which only birch has some commercial value. Changes are therefore needed to how forests are currently regenerated and managed. In these large forest areas this will require a large effort and a large investment, even when done at the gradual pace as simulated here.However, natural regeneration is the dominant means of forest regeneration in the three case studies at the moment.

        <p>Similarly, we assumed in all case studies an increase in the share of thinnings. This may not be in line with current practices and guidelines. Thinnings are currently executed to a very limited degree. Increasing the share of wood coming from thinnings could result in significant gains in carbon storage in biomass because the forest cover is maintained and higher quality wood products can be produced. Thinning more will not negatively affect the total roundwood production volumes, as we see from the results for Karelia and Mari El. To implement the CSF measures in practice, a change is thus needed to how forests are currently managed.Similarly, we assumed in all case studies an increase in the share of thinnings.

        <p>The estimated climate benefit of CSF varies from region to region depending on the baseline management, which is considered a continuation of current practices. As shown in Table 7, CSF led in all three regions to an improved CO 2 balance (additional sink and/or substitution), although effects are relatively small (in these slow growing systems) with a maximum additional benefit of ~0.7 Mg CO 2 /ha/yr.The estimated climate benefit of CSF varies from region to region depending on the baseline management, which is considered a continuation of current practices.

        <p>In The outcomes of the presented scenarios critically depend on the quality of the data that have been used as a basis for the projections. Firstly, we tried to use as much as possible the best available Russian data, but not all required data were available. For example, for increment we had to use yield tables and instead of data from Russian forest inventories. The main reason for this was that the concepts on annual increment differ between Russian and western European forestry (Pisarenko et al., 2000). For our simulations we needed net annual increment, which includes the increment on trees, which have been felled during the reference period, but excludes trees which have died -FAO, 2000). However, the increment reported in the Russian inventories refers to the remaining growing stock and thus excludes the growth of trees that have been cut.In The outcomes of the presented scenarios critically depend on the quality of the data that have been used as a basis for the projections.

        <p>Secondly, wood removals are a key factor that determine the development of forest resources and their associated carbon balances. Data on wood removals are usually associated with uncertainty and this will also apply to Russian conditions. Such uncertainties could relate to the reported volumes and assortments of wood felled and removed from the forests, losses of wood during harvest and transport, and the consumption of residential fuel wood (cf. Obersteiner, 1999).Secondly, wood removals are a key factor that determine the development of forest resources and their associated carbon balances.

        <p>Thirdly, we included the carbon pools in forest biomass and HWP and considered the effects of substitution, but we excluded impacts on the soil carbon pool. While this carbon pool is considered to be very important for Russia, we could not assess impacts of the scenarios on these pools because the data on the initial state are too uncertain and because the current sink/source functioning of the permafrost is too uncertain. Normally the soils would be frozen for 4-6 months, allowing machines to operate, but there are indications that with climate change it becomes increasingly difficult to harvest wood in the winter period (Global Wood Markets Info, 2020). Under current unfrozen conditions, the soil damage will be large, resulting in large soil carbon losses. Furthermore, most soil model can only deal with mineral soils not with peat soils which are very extensive in Russia. We may assume however that with less clear-cuts, the CSF approach may be beneficial for the soil carbon.Thirdly, we included the carbon pools in forest biomass and HWP and considered the effects of substitution, but we excluded impacts on the soil carbon pool.

        <p>In our analyses, we focused on the effects of forest management, but there are also other forest-related measures that could provide mitigation benefits. The Russian Federation is considered to have a large potential for afforestation or restoration; for example, Bastin et al. (2019) estimated that 151 mill. ha could be restored, which may provide mitigation potentials of up to 351 Mt CO 2 /year (Griscom et al., 2017). We did not focus on afforestation and restoration in our case studies, mainly because the three case studies are mostly forested regions with limited possibilities for additional afforestation. However, afforestation may be very relevant for other Russian regions.In our analyses, we focused on the effects of forest management, but there are also other forest-related measures that could provide mitigation benefits.

        <p>Overall, our results indicate that more active management particularly affects the development of the forest biomass carbon sink in the coming decades. For all three case studies, we show that a larger share of thinnings, regeneration with improved breeding materials, improved harvest efficiency and other measures can increase the forest biomass carbon sink and for case studies in Mari El and Karelia also the HWP balance improves compared to a development without such measures. In Angara macro-district, harvest levels had to be decreased to reach sustainable levels. Together with the other measures, this improves the forest biomass carbon balance, but worsens the HWP and substitution balance. The exact substitution effect will depend on the type of wood product, the type of non-wood material that is replaced and the post-use fate of the wood (Leskinen et al., 2018).Overall, our results indicate that more active management particularly affects the development of the forest biomass carbon sink in the coming decades.

        <p>Altogether, the results from our case studies show the possibilities and the limitations of forestry in Russia. The generally limited productivity in Russia, the required rate of implementation (e.g. of improved growth rates after clearfelling), the difficulties of implementing better practices in the field, the remoteness of many areas in combination with limited transportation network and very long hauling distances, will make it in practice very difficult to implement the scenarios as portrayed here. Developing regional action plans including required investment funding is a required first step.Altogether, the results from our case studies show the possibilities and the limitations of forestry in Russia.

        <p>In addition, there are several ways in which wood-based products can contribute to a net reduction of carbon emissions. Firstly, there is the carbon stored in the products themselves. The more durable the products are, the longer-lasting their carbon storage will be. Secondly, a net carbon reduction could be achieved by replacing fossil-based materials with bio-based, renewable materials. All these components reflect to potential benefits with life-cycle emissions of different products and production systems.In addition, there are several ways in which wood-based products can contribute to a net reduction of carbon emissions.

        <p>In the deep decarbonization scenarios, consumption of liquid fuels for transportation is expected to decline during 2010-2050, and the share of liquid biofuels is expected to increase substantially, from nearly zero in 2010-2020 to 1 EJ/year (or 24 Mt/year) in 2050 (Figure 42). This volume of liquid biofuels can be produced from wood biomass as second-generation biofuels (using pilot technologies as described in the following chapter), as well as from agricultural biomass.In the deep decarbonization scenarios, consumption of liquid fuels for transportation is expected to decline during 2010-2050, and the share of liquid biofuels is expected to increase substantially, from nearly zero in 2010-2020 to 1 EJ/year (or 24 Mt/year) in 2050 (Figure 42).

        <p>The projected biofuel consumption in all deep decarbonization scenarios is in the range of 3-7 EJ/year (or 72-167 Mt/year). This amount of biofuel can be sourced from the forest sector (wood waste, low grade timber, wood pellets, etc.) and agricultural sector (organic biomass, waste, residues, etc.). By caloric value, the biofuel required for deep decarbonization could be equivalent to 100-200 mill. tons / year of wood biomass.The projected biofuel consumption in all deep decarbonization scenarios is in the range of 3-7 EJ/year (or 72-167 Mt/year).

        <p>Currently, the contribution of the forest sector to the Russian economy is significantly lower than the estimated potential.

This can be used at existing coal-fired boiler houses and power plants without any technological changes to substitute for fossil coal. Its caloric value is comparable with fossil coal.

        <p>The three types of textiles with largest production volumes in Russia are cotton, synthetic fibres and silk (Wittmann, 2017). Even though synthetic fibres like polyester are still preferred by the industry for their price and more uniform characteristics, there is w h at s c i e n c e c a n t e l l u s an interest to reintroduce natural fibres to produce textiles.

Several companies have been investing in new production plants and a special Industrial Development Fund was created by the Russian government to provide support for the development and implementation of projects to develop the technical textiles industry.

        <p>When it comes to the production of wood-based textiles, in the 1980s Russia was a leading country in the production of dissolving pulp for viscose (Skripnikov, 2017;Eisenstein and Klepikov, 2018). However, in 2014, Russia produced only 1% of the viscose dissolving pulp manufactured worldwide (Statista, 2014).When it comes to the production of wood-based textiles, in the 1980s Russia was a leading country in the production of dissolving pulp for viscose (Skripnikov, 2017;Eisenstein and Klepikov, 2018).

        <p>As the traditional methods of producing viscose are considered environmentally harmful because of the chemicals used in the production process, and improved technologies for the manufacturing of wood-based fibres are being developed, it would be important for Russia to invest in the production of textiles obtained by more environmentally friendly methods. In addition to improved production technologies related to viscose, there are new technologies such as Spinnova and Ioncell-F. Such new wood-based fibres produce less CO 2 emissions than cotton and synthetic fibres and, among the several options of wood-based products, lead to higher climate substitution benefits (Leskinen et al., 2018).As the traditional methods of producing viscose are considered environmentally harmful because of the chemicals used in the production process, and improved technologies for the manufacturing of wood-based fibres are being developed, it would be important for Russia to invest in the production of textiles obtained by more environmentally friendly methods.

        <p>The current global textile production is estimated at around 93 mill. tons /year, of which around 53 mill. tons of fibre are produced annually for clothing (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). As it takes about 2.4 m 3 of wood to produce one tonne of textile fibre with the Spinnova technology, 127 mill. m 3 would suffice to meet the global annual clothing fibre demand. At a higher "alternative estimate", it would take about 4 m 3 of wood per ton of fibre, which would result in 212 mill. m 3 to supply annual fibre demand for clothing. The latter is based on an estimate cited by Uusipuu (2017), stating that 10 mill. m 3 would be needed to replace 10% of the global cotton markets, which was estimated at 25 mill. tons (OECD/FAO, 2019).The current global textile production is estimated at around 93 mill. tons /year, of which around 53 mill. tons of fibre are produced annually for clothing (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).

        <p>Perhaps a more realistic estimate would be that around 14% of all fibres would be manmade cellulosic and that these would not replace cotton, which reached a possible global maximum production of around 25 mill. tons in 2015 (Hämmerle, 2011). Therefore, the substitution would be rather for petroleum-based synthetic fibres, for which an average substitution value is 3.4 t CO 2 per ton of fibre.Perhaps a more realistic estimate would be that around 14% of all fibres would be manmade cellulosic and that these would not replace cotton, which reached a possible global maximum production of around 25 mill. tons in 2015 (Hämmerle, 2011).

        <p>The demand for fossil-based products, such as fuels, resins and polymers, has increased in the past decades. Concerns with the GHG emissions, the production of residues and the depletion of fossil resources have promoted the development of new products from bio-based sources. One chemical compound that shows a lot of potential for substituting fossil-based chemicals is lignin. It is the second most abundant natural polymer after cellulose. Despite having a crucial structural function in the composition of wood and being one of the most important chemical components in terms of volume, lignin is still treated as a residue of the pulping process, being mostly used for energy production. Lignin can be broken into building blocks which can be used in the manufacture of several value-added products. Because lignin is a very stable molecule, its fractionation -or division into smaller molecules -can be difficult. Despite that, many advancements have been made in this area in the past few years and the production of lignin as a precursor to several value-added products has become promising. The type of lignin varies according to the feedstock and the production process, the most common one being the lignosulfonates -byproducts from the production of wood pulp using sulfite pulping. The bulk of these commercial lignins is used as plasticizers for concrete, dispersants, binders, and food additives (such as vanillin) (Berlin and Balakshin, 2014). It is estimated that close to 1 mill. tons of lignosulfonates is produced in the world each year (Bajpai, 2018), from roughly 10 mill. m 3 of RWE (Ervasti, 2016).The demand for fossil-based products, such as fuels, resins and polymers, has increased in the past decades.

For example, currently forest area damaged from wildfires fluctuates already between 4 and 7 mill. ha/year expressed as a multi-annual trend. More importantly, even more severe disturbances are expected in absence of enhanced prevention measures. This can have far-reaching consequences for the global climate and more locally for regional ecosystems and human well-being.

        <p>Forest management should be improved to mitigate climate change and to adapt to climate change impacts especially in the European part of Russia and the southern zones of the rest of Russia. An important management measure that could provide climate benefits is to increase the share of wood coming from thinning in total wood removals.

In two regions, CSF led to an improved CO 2 balance (additional sink and substitution) of ~0.6 ton CO 2 /ha/year. However, in one region where currently overharvesting is taking place, the harvest level had to be reduced for CSF scenarios. This led to an additional mitigation effect in the forest biomass of 0.4 ton CO 2 /ha/year, but because of a negative material substitution effect, the total improved net effect was only 0.1 ton CO 2 /ha/year.Case-specific Climate Smart Forestry (CSF) example scenarios led in varying results, depending on the baseline management currently implemented in the case studies.

The key findings and recommendations for the next steps can be summarized as follows:</p>
        <p>1) Currently, Russian forests represent a large carbon sink, but there are also large areas in the Northern and Eastern parts of Russia, which act as a carbon source.1) Currently, Russian forests represent a large carbon sink, but there are also large areas in the Northern and Eastern parts of Russia, which act as a carbon source.</p>
        <p>These areas are typically located either on permafrost or in disturbed forests. However, the several years of large wildfire disturbances with subsequently increased tree mortality may lead to substantial decrease of the Russian forest carbon sink.These areas are typically located either on permafrost or in disturbed forests. However, the several years of large wildfire disturbances with subsequently increased tree mortality may lead to substantial decrease of the Russian forest carbon sink.</p>
        <p>2) Future natural disturbance impacts are critical: attention should be paid to preventing of disturbances and enhancing forest restoration/reforestation. Climate change impacts will put the current forest sector severely at risk. The potential to reach the Paris Agreement targets through a significant contribution of the bioeconomy cannot be achieved without active forest management with a strong focus on natural disturbance prevention and enhancing forest resilience.2) Future natural disturbance impacts are critical: attention should be paid to preventing of disturbances and enhancing forest restoration/reforestation.

        <p>3) Investments in sustainable and climate-smart forest management are needed and should be aimed at long-term goals rather than short-term lease contracts, as well as to improved infrastructure especially in the accessible forests. Without active, climate-smart forest management, the ambitious bioeconomy goals cannot be achieved. In other words, investing in bioeconomy would enable funding for improved forest management and infrastructure, which could further lead also to protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services.3) Investments in sustainable and climate-smart forest management are needed and should be aimed at long-term goals rather than short-term lease contracts, as well as to improved infrastructure especially in the accessible forests.

        <p>4) Another important focus is forest restoration since there most likely will be largescale natural disturbances also in the future.

        <p>The gigantic scale of Russian forests poses significant challenges with large sparsely populated remote areas and lacking infrastructure. Harvest usage has been much higher in densely populated regions and resulted in degrading quality of forest resources with undesirable changes of species composition and decreasing area of exploitable forests. • Russian forests were a significant net carbon sink during the last decades, with high temporal and spatial variability mainly caused by interannual variability of seasonal weather and natural disturbances. The estimated carbon sink amount ranges from 150-200 Mt C /year in the official reporting to UNFCCC to more than 600 Mt C in independent scientific assessments, with differences explained by different land area references as well as variable representation of ecosystem processes and disturbances. Despite the average sink, there are vast areas, mostly in disturbed forests and on permafrost, which temporarily act as a carbon source. • During the current century, carbon sink dynamics in Russian forests had no statistically significant trend until 2017, but an exceptionally high level of disturbances in 2018-2020 will likely result in a substantial decrease of the Russian forest carbon sink. • Forest disturbances pose the most important threat to Russian forests by damages of 10-15 mill. ha of forests annually with forest fires being the main natural disturbance factor. • A fundamental challenge in Russian forestry is the need to replace the extensive exploitative model of forest use with the model of intensive sustainable forest management to respond to deteriorating forest resource conditions. • Improved forest governance with new forest policies and significant investments in the Russian forest sector are needed to reconstruct the forest sector in Russia.The gigantic scale of Russian forests poses significant challenges with large sparsely populated remote areas and lacking infrastructure.

        <p>One of the main challenges in wood construction of high-rise buildings is legal framework related to building permissions and safety regulations. As the development company Etalon planned a multistorey wooden building in Moscow, they were met with regulations stating that until early 2020, wooden buildings could not be higher than three storeys (Code of rules, 2002). In April 2020, two regulatory documents ("Public buildings with wooden structures. Design rules" (Ministry of construction, 2019a) and "Multicompartment residential buildings with wooden structures. Design rules" (Ministry of construction, 2019b)) were approved, allowing the construction of wooden buildings up to 28-meters high (about 8 storeys).One of the main challenges in wood construction of high-rise buildings is legal framework related to building permissions and safety regulations.

        <p>During the Soviet Union, lignin was generated as residue from the ethanol and fodder yeast production processes. It was also a residue from the production of the solvent furfural. This lignin had no commercial use, being discarded in dumpsites. The transformation and use of lignin could be further developed in Russia, since there is already basic knowledge developed for this subject (Abdrakhmanova et al., 2016). The total value of forest-based chemicals produced in Russia, amounted to 2797 mill. roubles (approximately 34.5 mill. euro) in 2016 in accordance with the Strategy of Russian Forest Complex Development until 2030 (Government, 2018).During the Soviet Union, lignin was generated as residue from the ethanol and fodder yeast production processes.

        <p>The industry has been looking for solutions to overcome this issue and some new biobased products are currently under development and testing.

        <p>One successful example is the production of wood-based plastic lining for beverage cartons. It is a substitute for fossil-based plastic but with the advantage of being recycled with cardboard. This type of wood-based plastic can be produced using the tall oil resulting from the pulping process. In 2019, it is estimated that more than 40 million milk and yogurt cartons with bioplastic lining were used in Finland, reducing the need for fossil-based plastics by 180 000 kg per year.One successful example is the production of wood-based plastic lining for beverage cartons.

        <p>In recent years, many Russian companies have been demonstrating interest in developing and producing biodegradable packaging. However, the bioplastics industry in Russia is still at early stages of development. There are some barriers to the development of the bioplastics industry: the limited paying capacity of companies and potential consumers, the lack of strong regulations to reduce the use of fossil-based materials, and the lack of interest from investors and companies in the development of technologies with long return periods (Volchok et al., 2018).In recent years, many Russian companies have been demonstrating interest in developing and producing biodegradable packaging.

        <p>The concept of bioeconomy is relatively new and underutilized in Russia as it is mostly associated with biotechnology. Maximizing the potential of wood-based products in areas such as multi-storey wood construction and wood-based textiles can be important for the Russian economy and bring important additional climate change mitigation benefits.The concept of bioeconomy is relatively new and underutilized in Russia as it is mostly associated with biotechnology.

        <p>Scenarios for reducing greenhouse gas emissions presented in Chapter 6.2.3, aiming at 85% GHG emission reductions, show that significant efforts are needed in reducing energy consumption and moving the energy production away from the use of fossils. The scenarios do not yet include the potential that would come from bioeconomy development liked e.g. to wood construction or wood-based textiles. Bioenergy and wood-based products cannot solve the challenge alone, but they can significantly contribute to it.Scenarios for reducing greenhouse gas emissions presented in Chapter 6.2.3, aiming at 85% GHG emission reductions, show that significant efforts are needed in reducing energy consumption and moving the energy production away from the use of fossils.

        <p>According to Chapter 6.4.1, gas is currently the main fuel in the Russian energy sector with a share of 74%. The share of solid fuels is 22%, consisting mainly of fossil coal. The overall share of energy from biomass is low leaving room for increasing its share in the energy mix. Despite producing wood pellets since 2000, most of the production is currently exported, mainly to Europe. Overall, there seems to be a growth potential in pellet production as well as domestic use of it in the energy mix. Similarly, wood-based briquettes show growth potential in production and domestic consumption. Fuel wood chips production is also expected to have growth potential through domestic consumption.According to Chapter 6.4.1, gas is currently the main fuel in the Russian energy sector with a share of 74%.

        <p>Volumes of residential construction in Russia have declined to some extent since 2015 (see Chapter 6.4.2) and currently the total amount of residential construction is about 76 mill. m 2 per year. The overall volume of wooden construction in Russia is small, and the production of prefabricated wooden buildings has not shown significant increase during recent years. Despite this, the government of Russia has adopted a series of measures to increase overall construction volumes so that the total amount of residential construction in 2030 would reach 170 mill. m 2 per year. This can provide major growth potential for modern wood construction technologies such as CLT. It is expected that a first test batch of CLT elements will be produced in Russia in late 2020, to become fully operational shortly thereafter. According to the optimistic scenario, annual wood-based construction could by 2050 be at level of 183 m 2 .

        <p>Conclusions Pekka Leskinen, Jo Van Brusselen, Marcus Lindner, Gert-Jan Nabuurs, Pieter Johannes Verkerk, Natalia Lukina, Sergey Bartalev and Elena KulikovaConclusions Pekka Leskinen, Jo Van Brusselen, Marcus Lindner, Gert-Jan Nabuurs, Pieter Johannes Verkerk, Natalia Lukina, Sergey Bartalev and Elena Kulikova</p>
        <p>There is no doubt about the global importance of the Russian Federation's forests in terms of forest area, carbon stock, influence on global climate, potential as a renewable resource, as well as biodiversity preservation. Russia has the largest areas of primary boreal forests in the world and only a relatively small fraction of the total forest resources is utilised economically.There is no doubt about the global importance of the Russian Federation's forests in terms of forest area, carbon stock, influence on global climate, potential as a renewable resource, as well as biodiversity preservation. Russia has the largest areas of primary boreal forests in the world and only a relatively small fraction of the total forest resources is utilised economically.</p>
        <p>The resource abundance does not mean, however, that the forests are in their optimal state. For example, due to poor management, the average growing stock per hectare is much lower than what would be achievable under sustainable forest management regimes, although the state of the forests varies heavily from region to region. Some areas have high volumes, whereas other regions are understocked as a result of overexploitation or massive fire disturbances. Harvested amounts are much higher in populated regions and there can also be a lack of high value timber in regions of high demand.The resource abundance does not mean, however, that the forests are in their optimal state.

        <p>Because of the clear-cut management system and insufficiency of reforestation efforts, mostly aspen and birch forests regenerate, which are not much used economically. Also hauling distances can become too long rather quickly. Major challenges for the management of the forests are abandoned agricultural land areas and migration of people from rural to urban areas. As the regions are different, there is no one approach that would suit all and regional forest management plans need to be developed further with deeper consideration of region-specific measures.Because of the clear-cut management system and insufficiency of reforestation efforts, mostly aspen and birch forests regenerate, which are not much used economically.
