        <p>Pulsar timing arrays offer a probe of the low-frequency gravitational wave spectrum (1-100 nHz), which is intimately connected to a number of markers that can uniquely trace the formation and evolution of the Universe. We present the dataset and the results of the timing analysis from the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). The dataset contains high-precision pulsar timing data from 25 millisecond pulsars collected with the five largest radio telescopes in Europe, as well as the Large European Array for Pulsars. The dataset forms the foundation for the search for gravitational waves by the EPTA, presented in associated papers. We describe the dataset and present the results of the frequentist and Bayesian pulsar timing analysis for individual millisecond pulsars that have been observed over the last ∼25 yr. We discuss the improvements to the individual pulsar parameter estimates, as well as new measurements of the physical properties of these pulsars and their companions. This data release extends the dataset from EPTA Data Release 1 up to the beginning of 2021, with individual pulsar datasets with timespans ranging from 14 to 25 yr. These lead to improved constraints on annual parallaxes, secular variation of the orbital period, and Shapiro delay for a number of sources. Based on these results, we derived astrophysical parameters that include distances, transverse velocities, binary pulsar masses, and annual orbital parallaxes.Pulsar timing arrays offer a probe of the low-frequency gravitational wave spectrum (1-100 nHz), which is intimately connected to a number of markers that can uniquely trace the formation and evolution of the Universe.

        <p>Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs; Sazhin 1978;Detweiler 1979) search for gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz (nHz) frequencies by observing a suite of stable, rapidly rotating millisecond pulsars (MSPs; Backer 1993) over decadal timescales (Foster &amp; Backer 1990;Desvignes et al. 2016;Verbiest et al. 2016). These GWs may be produced by inspiralling supermassive black holes binaries (SMBHBs; see e.g. Sesana et al. 2004;Sesana 2013), cosmic strings (Damour &amp; Vilenkin 2001;Grishchuk 2005;Boyle &amp; Buonanno 2008), phase transitions in the early Universe (Schwaller 2015), quantum fluctuations in the primordial gravitational field (Grishchuk 2005;Lasky et al. 2016), or from a primordial magnetic field (see Caprini &amp; Figueroa 2018, and references therein).Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs; Sazhin 1978;Detweiler 1979) search for gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz (nHz) frequencies by observing a suite of stable, rapidly rotating millisecond pulsars (MSPs; Backer 1993) over decadal timescales (Foster &amp; Backer 1990;Desvignes et al. 2016;Verbiest et al. 2016).

In addition, these telescopes regularly operate as the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP), which offers an equivalent diameter of up to 194 m (Bassa et al. 2016b).

        <p>The first EPTA data release (henceforth DR1; Desvignes et al. 2016) only included data from legacy data recording systems. Most of these made use of the incoherent dedispersion scheme implemented on custom-built hardware, placing a fundamental limit on achievable timing precision. In EPTA DR2, we added data from next-generation coherent dedispersion recording systems that offer a significant increase in bandwidth and sensitivity at each telescope. These new backends use hardware based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to carry out the conversion of the electrical signal into a digital data stream and to apply polyphase filterbanks and, in some cases, some pre-filtering of the recorded band to reject known radio frequency interference (RFI). For most of the next-generation EPTA recording backends, this data processing step is implemented on the second generation of the Reconfigurable 
            <rs type="software">Open Architecture Computing Hardware (ROACH)</rs> platform, developed by the 
            <rs type="creator">Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER</rs>; Hickish et al. 2016). In the following sub-sections, we describe the pulsar recording systems and data processing schemes for each telescope in more detail (see Table 1 for an overview).

        <p>The Effelsberg 100 m single-dish radio telescope located near Bad Munstereifel is maintained and operated by the Max Planck Institut für Radioastronomie. The Effelsberg Berkeley Pulsar Processor (EBPP; Backer et al. 1997) was used to record observations up to 2009. A ROACH-based backend became the main EFF pulsar backend in 2011 (Lazarus et al. 2016). This system is capable of coherently dedispersing and folding dual-polarisation data streams over a total bandwidth of up to ∼500 MHz.The Effelsberg 100 m single-dish radio telescope located near Bad Munstereifel is maintained and operated by the Max Planck Institut für Radioastronomie.

        <p>The observations in the Effelsberg Radio Telescope were conducted in L, S , and C bands 1 . Depending on the central frequency, different receivers were used, as summarised in Lazarus et al. (2016). L-band observations were performed with the P200mm and P217mm receivers of the telescope. These offer bandwidths of 140 MHz and 240 MHz, respectively.The observations in the Effelsberg Radio Telescope were conducted in L, S , and C bands 1 .

        <p>S -band observations around 2600 MHz were made with the S110mm receiver. The receiver frequency coverage increased from 80 MHz to 300 MHz after the second half of 2018.

        <p>The typical integration length per source was 30 min, which included a 2 min scan of the noise diode for polarisation calibration. Data reduction of the folded coherently dedispersed pulsar archives, including flux and polarisation calibrations, was carried out via the 
            <rs type="software">COASTGUARD</rs> pipeline, which is part of the 
            <rs type="software">TOASTER</rs> software library (see Lazarus et al. 2016, for a detailed description). The removal of RFI was carried out with the pazi command in 
            <rs type="software">PSRCHIVE</rs>. For each pulsar, we produced a profile template at each observing band by adding the three observations with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Data taken with the P200mm and P217mm receivers were analysed with the same template. Each observation was integrated over frequency, time, and polarisation to produce integrated pulse profiles. For Lband data, observations were divided into two subbands, except for PSRs J1738+0333, J1843-1113 and J2322+2057, which were typically weak and required integration over the entire band. TOAs were then produced by cross-correlating the pulse profiles with the respective pulse-profile templates (see Lazarus et al. 2016, for details).

        <p>The Lovell Telescope is located at the JBO, in Cheshire, UK. It is a 76 m (250 ft) parabolic dish on an altitude-azimuth mount. The telescope is operated by the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester. Since January 2009, pulsar data have been processed using a clone of the Digital Filter Bank (DFB) developed by the Australian National Telescope Facility. From April 2011 onwards, data were simultaneously processed using the DFB and a ROACH board.The Lovell Telescope is located at the JBO, in Cheshire, UK.

        <p>Although the DFB initially operated over a bandwidth of 128 MHz centred on 1400 MHz, from September 2009 onwards, the observing frequency coverage increased to 512 MHz centred at 1520 MHz, of which the central 384 MHz were typically used. ROACH observations covered a 512 MHz band centred on 1532 MHz. The edges of the band were masked, leaving a total of 400 MHz of usable bandwidth.Although the DFB initially operated over a bandwidth of 128 MHz centred on 1400 MHz, from September 2009 onwards, the observing frequency coverage increased to 512 MHz centred at 1520 MHz, of which the central 384 MHz were typically used.

        <p>The typical integration time per source was varied depending on the pulsar and epoch, with the median observation times per pulsar ranging between ∼10 min to 55 min. These observations were time-stamped using an on-site hydrogen maser clock and then corrected to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using recorded offsets between local time kept by the hydrogen maser and GPS time. At JBO, the observations were typically not flux or polarisation calibrated.The typical integration time per source was varied depending on the pulsar and epoch, with the median observation times per pulsar ranging between ∼10 min to 55 min.

        <p>For the ROACH backend, data streams from two orthogonal polarisations were sampled at the Nyquist rate and digitised as 8-bit numbers. Notes. TEMPO2 flags are constructed from these values using the telescope abbreviations, the backend names and the central observing frequency for characterising system noise properties through the 'group' flag or the sub-band centre frequencies for determining phase offsets or JUMPS with 'system' flags. For example, for a TOA from an observation made at the Nançay Radio Telescope with the NUPPI backend, from the sub-band 1420 MHz when the backend was acquiring its full bandwith around a central frequency of 1854 MHz, the system flag is NRT.NUPPI.1420 and the group flag is NRT.NUPPI.1484. A dash-symbol indicates that no sub-bands were created and the system and group flags are identical.

        <p>each 16 MHz sub-band was then dedispersed and folded into 1024 bins at the pulse period in real-time. Each of the 16 MHz sub-bands was further divided into 64 channels, each 0.25 MHz wide and recorded on disk in 10 s long sub-integrations. The lowest and highest 56 MHz of the band were discarded due to persistent and known contamination by RFI sources at these frequencies. Therefore, the total bandwidth recorded on disk was 400 MHz. For the DFB, the two orthogonal polarisation data streams, covering 512 MHz, were incoherently dedispersed and folded into 1024 bins at the pulse period using 0.5 MHz wide channels and 10 s sub-integrations. In this case, the lowest and highest 64 MHz of the total band were discarded due to contamination by RFI. The mitigation of RFI in both DFB and ROACH data was carried out using a median filtering algorithm, which was followed by manual inspection. Since November 2011, ROACH data have also been cleaned in real-time using a spectral kurtosis method (Morello et al. 2022). For each pulsar observation, the pipeline produced archive files with various frequency and time resolutions. These were fully frequency-averaged archives with full time resolution (10 s long sub-integrations); fully time-averaged profiles with full frequency resolution (0.25 MHz wide and 0.50 MHz wide channels for the ROACH and DFB, respectively); archives that were partially averaged in time and frequency (1 min long sub-integrations and 8 MHz-wide and 12 MHz-wide channels for the ROACH and DFB, respectively) and finally; profiles that were fully averaged in time and frequency.each 16 MHz sub-band was then dedispersed and folded into 1024 bins at the pulse period in real-time.

        <p>TOAs were formed for each observation using the pat command in 
            <rs type="software">PSRCHIVE</rs> (van Straten et al. 2012), which employs the FDM algorithm (Verbiest et al. 2016) using the template profile for the appropriate frequency. In the work presented here, for each epoch, we divided the partially (time-)averaged files to produce two archives, one for each subband centred on 1420 MHz and 1620 MHz, respectively. These files were then averaged in frequency and time individually, to finally produce two TOAs spanning the full observation duration.

        <p>Regular EPTA timing observations were conducted with the NRT from late 2004. These observations were made using the Land S -band receivers of the telescope, with a frequency coverage of 1.1 GHz to 1.8 GHz, and 1.7 GHz to 3.5 GHz, respectively. From late 2004 until early 2014, the legacy Berkeley-Orléans-Nançay (BON) backend (Cognard &amp; Theureau 2006) was used to record the pulsar timing data included in the EPTA DR1 dataset (for a detailed description, see Desvignes et al. 2016). Starting in August 2011, the Nançay Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument (NUPPI) became the primary pulsar timing backend (Cognard et al. 2013;Liu et al. 2020). The EPTA DR2 dataset includes data collected with the NUPPI backend between August 2011 and early 2021. NUPPI observations have durations ranging from 20 min to 80 min, and cover a frequency bandwidth of 512 MHz channelised into 128 channels that are coherently dedispersed in real-time. Observations with the L-band receiver were made at a central frequency of 1484 MHz. Those with the S -band receiver were generally centred on 2539 MHz and occasionally on 1854 and 2154 MHz. Data collected before MJD 57924 were time-stamped using a local rubidium clock, and later corrected to GPS standard time stamped using recorded offsets between the clock and the Paris Observatory Universal Time. Data collected after this epoch were directly stamped with the GPS time standard, as the backend was locked to the GPS signal. Data were calibrated for polarisation using a short scan on a reference noise diode, conducted prior to each observation, with the SingleAxis 2 method of PSRCHIVE, to correct for the differential phase and amplitude between the two polarisations. Since late 2019, this simple calibration scheme was further complemented by regular observations of bright polarised pulsars in a mode where the horn rotated by ∼180 • across the 1 h observation, enabling a better determination of the polarimetric response of the NRT at the epoch of the observations. These observations and the procedure followed for analysing them are described in Guillemot et al. (2023). Automatic RFI mitigation was performed on polarisation-averaged archives with the full frequency and time resolution available (typically, 4 MHz and 5 s to 60 s time resolution), using a Python script based on the surgical RFI-cleaning algorithm of the COASTGUARD software package (Lazarus et al. 2016). Observations corrupted by strong RFI, calibration issues, incidental backend faults, or those that contained no visible pulsar signal, were discarded. We formed template profiles with the four Stokes parameters and with four frequency sub-bands by integrating the eight highest S/N observations, smoothing the average using a wavelet smoothing method. Finally, we used these polarimetric profiles and the matrix template matching (MTM) technique implemented in pat (van Straten 2006) to extract TOAs from the NUPPI observations. By modelling the transformation between polarised light curves, the MTM method corrects potential polarisation artefacts (caused by, e.g., calibration issues), yielding more accurate TOAs. The procedure developed at Nançay to improve the polarisation calibration of the NUPPI data will be presented in detail in Guillemot et al.

        <p>The Sardinia Radio Telescope is a 64 m parabolic dish with an altitude-azimuth mount. The receiver that is used primarily for EPTA observations is the dual-band L/P receiver (original Pband = 305 MHz to 410 MHz and L-band = 1. . Data during the EPTA observations were mainly acquired with a DFB as well as a ROACH backend, the latter of which is a copy of those installed at JBO and Effelsberg. Both backends are capable of performing real-time folding of the incoming data, each with a bandwidth of 500 MHz. Additionally, an 8-node CPU cluster installed with ROACH allows the baseband recording of the full LEAP bandwidth (128 MHz). The data were timestamped using a local hydrogen maser. EPTA observations at the SRT started in March 2014 and went on until July 2016, and were resumed from May 2018 onwards. The intermediate gap was due to repairs of the L/P receiver, refurbishment of the active surface of the dish, and relocation of the control room along with the digital instruments to a permanent structure. Most of these observations were conducted as part of the LEAP observing programme. For the work in this paper, these data were directly integrated into the LEAP data products, rather than being included as independent pulsar timing data (see Sect. 2.7).The Sardinia Radio Telescope is a 64 m parabolic dish with an altitude-azimuth mount.

        <p>The WSRT was an equatorial mount linear array consisting of 14 dishes of 25 m diameter which were coherently added to form a 93 m equivalent dish. Pulsar observations formed a key science operation and were carried out using the Pulsar Machine (PumaI; Strom 2002) backend from 1999 until mid-2010. From 2007 to mid-2015, pulsar observations were performed using the second generation Pulsar Machine (PuMaII; Karuppusamy et al. 2008) which was a coherent dedispersion backend capable of simultaneously recording data across a total bandwidth of 64 MHz to 128 MHz. For both PuMa backends, the WSRT was equipped with the turret-mounted Multi-Frequency FrontEnds (MFFEs; Tan 1991), which allowed for rapid changes in observing frequency. From 2013 onwards, the effective size of WSRT for pulsar observations gradually decreased due to dishes being removed from the array as the infrastructure was converted to adapt the telescopes for the new phased array feeds; the APERture Tile In Focus (APERTIF; van Cappellen et al. 2022). To account for the decrease in sensitivity, the observing time per pulsar was steadily increased during this transition period, which ended on 15 June 2015 when the WSRT officially ended its multiband operations.The WSRT was an equatorial mount linear array consisting of 14 dishes of 25 m diameter which were coherently added to form a 93 m equivalent dish.

        <p>The PumaI backend was used in conjunction with the MFFEs to observe pulsars at 328 MHz, 382 MHz, 800 MHz, 1420 MHz and 2200 MHz, with the data recorded in a custom format. TOAs were created from the PuMaI backend by first converting the observations to ASCII total intensity profiles and then cross-correlating them with templates as described in Desvignes et al. (2016) The duration of pulsar observations at the WSRT varied with pulsar and epoch and lasted between 15 min and 45 min. However, at later epochs, the duration per pulsar was extended to account for the loss of sensitivity because fewer dishes were available. These observations were time-stamped to UTC at the observatory using a GPS-referenced local hydrogen maser. Daily averages of the local maser clock were also compared with other observatory masers as part of regular, very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) recordings. The local clock at WSRT was affected by a discrete offset of 10 s between ∼56 808 MJD to 56 903 MJD due to a failure of the local Network Time Protocol (Mills 1997) server.The PumaI backend was used in conjunction with the MFFEs to observe pulsars at 328 MHz, 382 MHz, 800 MHz, 1420 MHz and 2200 MHz, with the data recorded in a custom format.

        <p>To achieve phase coherence between the dishes, standard interferometric coherent phasing of the array was performed at the start of each observing run. By observing an astronomical calibrator, the signal amplitudes for each polarisation were equalised for all individual antennas. This maximised the vector sum of each polarised data stream, leading to very stable polarisation behaviour, especially at 1380 MHz and 2273 MHz which was stable for at least a couple of days. No further calibration (flux or polarisation) was performed, although the polarisation response was cross-validated against calibrated data from the other telescopes when the WSRT was operated in LEAP mode.To achieve phase coherence between the dishes, standard interferometric coherent phasing of the array was performed at the start of each observing run.

        <p>The PuMAII backend recorded raw data in psrdada3 format, which were dedispersed using DM values stored in TEMPO-style ephemeris files. PuMaII produced PSRCHIVE archives for each band with a final sub-integration length of 10 s and 64 channels of 10 MHz and 20 MHz, depending on the observing band. The data were Nyquist sampled for each channel at a resolution of 25 ns leading to a variable number of bins for the pulsars; thus, the fastest pulsars have 256 bins, while the slowest have 8192.The PuMAII backend recorded raw data in psrdada3 format, which were dedispersed using DM values stored in TEMPO-style ephemeris files.

        <p>The excision of the RFI in WSRT was performed using a custom tool based on PSRCHIVE, followed by manual inspection. To compensate for decreased amplitude response at the band edges and obtain continuous frequency coverage, files per frequency band were split and re-added, providing effective bandwidths of 70 MHz at 350 MHz, 160 MHz at 1380 MHz, 130 MHz at 1396 MHz (LEAP mode) and 150 MHz at 2200 MHz.The excision of the RFI in WSRT was performed using a custom tool based on PSRCHIVE, followed by manual inspection.

        <p>For each of the band-averaged datasets, individual observations were further reprocessed for RFI removal using

            <rs type="software">Pulsar Processing Suite</rs>. Each observation was then averaged over frequency and time to produce the pulse profiles. Templates for each pulsar were produced by averaging the smallest number of profiles that contribute ∼90% of the S/N of the entire dataset, and TOAs were generated following the recommendations in Appendix A of (Verbiest et al. 2016), by using pat with the FDM algorithm.

        <p>LEAP performs simultaneous monthly observations of more than twenty MSPs at 1.4 GHz with the five EPTA telescopes mentioned above (Bassa et al. 2016b). During each observation, the telescopes switch between the pulsar and a nearby phase calibrator. The typical exposure time per pair of pulsar and phase calibrator is 45-60 and 2-3 min, respectively. All phase calibrators were selected from the VLBA calibrator catalogue 5 . During the observations, baseband data were recorded at the Nyquist rate with 8-bit sampling and 8 × 16 MHz subbands. The data were later assembled at JBO where they were correlated, calibrated for polarisation, and coherently combined with a dedicated software correlator (Smits et al. 2017), using Effelsberg as a geometrical and time reference. Narrowband RFI from a particular telescope was also removed before the data were combined. The combined baseband data of each pulsar were then coherently dedispersed and folded to form 10 s sub-integrations with a 1 MHz frequency resolution, using the 
            <rs type="software">DSPSR</rs> software package. Data were visually inspected to remove any remaining impulse RFI. Next, for each pulsar, the data from each individual observation were averaged in time and frequency and used to calculate the TOA of the integrated profile with the MCMC implementation of the canonical template matching scheme (Taylor 1992;Verbiest et al. 2016). The template was created using the observation with the highest S/N (which was eventually not included in the timing dataset) using a wavelet smoothing scheme to remove the radiometer noise on top of the pulsar signal. Most of the processing of the dedispersed, folded data was carried out with the 
            <rs type="software">PSRCHIVE</rs> software package.

        <p>We followed the timing and combination steps described in Verbiest et al. (2016) and Desvignes et al. (2016) to combine the data across telescopes. For each pulsar, data from different telescopes were combined using TEMPO2 to form the joint dataset, starting with parameters from Desvignes et al. (2016) and using a summary TOA file, following Perera et al. (2019), Verbiest et al. (2016) and Desvignes et al. (2016). To align the data from different observing systems, we fitted for an arbitrary phase offset (commonly referred to as jump) for each sub-band and backend combination, using the NUPPI sub-band centred at 1420 MHz as our reference dataset. For a small number of individual backend datasets, discrete time offsets were detected and estimated using multi-pulsar analysis. These were also removed using the TEMPO2 TIME keyword. During certain observing runs, data were collected using both legacy and new backends, or in both single-telescope and LEAP modes. As these observations represented the same signal and noise, we eliminated the older backend and non-LEAP data. However, we kept the data outside the LEAP bands to better constrain dispersion-measure (DM) variations. The overlapping data were removed after the jump values were determined. With this final set of curated TOAs, we then produced initial timing solutions for each pulsar using TEMPO2. For these solutions, the timing parameters were fitted for iteratively using TEMPO2, until the linearised timing solution converged. For each of the pulsars, we then investigated the likelihood of introducing new timing parameters that were not fitted for in DR1, using a 5σ detection threshold, as well as a number of F-statistic and information criteria based tests. All initial timing models include the spin frequency and its derivative, DM and its first and second derivative, the astrometric parameters (position, proper motions, and in several cases the annual parallax). For binary pulsars, we included fits for five Keplerian parameters and a selection of post-Keplerian (pK) parameters, depending on the pulsar. The full set of parameters included in each timing model is listed in Tables B.1-B.7. We note that we used equatorial coordinates to fit for the positions of most pulsars, except for PSRs J0030+0451, J1022+1001 and J1730-2304, for which we used ecliptic coordinates, as their ecliptic latitude is less than 1 deg. We used the DE440 version of the JPL solar system ephemeris (Park et al. 2021) and TT(BIPM2021) (Petit 2009) 6 as our reference clock standard. We also applied the default spherical of the Solar Wind electron density model implemented in TEMPO2 to correct for solar wind-related DM variations, fixing the average density in the ecliptic plane at 1 au to 7.9 cm -3 (Madison et al. 2019) following Tiburzi et al. (2021), except for PSR J1022+1001, as described in Sect. 3.4.We followed the timing and combination steps described in Verbiest et al. (2016) and Desvignes et al.

        <p>The EPTA DR2 dataset was checked for outliers using the following procedures. The first step to eliminate outliers was performed when compiling single telescope data, either by custom automated data flagging or manual inspection. After initial combination, outstanding outliers, such as TOAs with residuals offset by more than 10 times the root mean square (rms) of the timing solutions, were flagged and the observation archives reinspected. We found that these were typically associated with low S/N and were therefore removed. Additionally, we removed observations with known calibration issues as well as those displaying corrupted polarisation profiles or systematic trends in single-epoch timing residuals. A similar analysis was carried out using the semi-automated analysis, including tests from expected correlations such as excess contribution from the Solar Wind or epoch-wise offsets. Finally, we inspected the whitened residuals using the results of the noise modelling analysis (see the next subsection), which revealed that all remaining TOAs were within 5σ of the whitened timing residuals, indicating that no additional outlier removal was needed.The EPTA DR2 dataset was checked for outliers using the following procedures.

        <p>To obtain the final timing solution for each pulsar, we performed a Bayesian timing analysis on the combined dataset using the

It explores the parameter space of a non-linear pulsar timing models using nested sampling (Skilling 2004) based on Bayesian inference (Lentati et al. 2014), to provide robust estimates for the timing parameters. For the analysis of each pulsar, in addition to the deterministic pulsar timing parameters, we included a set of stochastic parameters to characterise the noise components in the dataset. Within our adopted framework, the white noise is described by a multiplicative factor E f (EFAC) that accounts for the possible underestimation of TOA uncertainties, and a factor E q that is added in quadrature (EQUAD) to model any other possible source of noise, such as pulse phase jitter and systematics (e.g. Liu et al. 2011Liu et al. , 2012)). These are related to the uncertainty of the TOA measurement, σ r , as follows:

All model parameters were sampled with uniform priors, except for EQUAD and the amplitude of the red-noise processes, which used a log-uniform prior. For PSR J1022+1001, whose line of sight lies very close to the ecliptic plane, we also fitted the solar wind density at the orbit distance of the Earth, instead of fixing its value to 7.9 cm -3 as was done for the other pulsars. This helped to obtain an estimate of the timing parallax consistent with other pulsar timing and VLBI measurements (see Sect. 4.3 for more details).During the analysis with TEMPONEST, both timing and noise parameters were sampled simultaneously, while the time offsets were analytically marginalised.

        <p>For 12 of the 25 pulsars in DR2, thanks to the extended data and increased sensitivity of the next-generation receivers, we measure several new timing parameters in comparison to DR1. Some of these measurements are also reported here for the first time. These results are discussed in detail in the following subsections. In addition, DR2 includes improved timing solutions for the binary systems J0751+1807, J0900-3144, J1024-0719, J1455-3330, J1713+0747, J1857+0943, J1909-3744 and J1910+1256, as well as for the isolated pulsars J0030+0451, J1744-1134, J1843-1113, J2124-3358, and J2322+2057, even though no additional timing parameters were measured compared to EPTA DR1. For PSR J1024-0719, where we only fit the second spin frequency derivative as in previous work (Bassa et al. 2016c), we performed additional investigations to explore the measurability of higher order spin frequency derivatives (see Sect. 5.5). For PSR J1857+0943, we omitted the fit for secular variation of the orbital projected semi-major axis ( ẋ) which was poorly constrained from the timing analysis. Meanwhile, a rough estimate of this parameter may still be inferred by searching for the annual orbital parallax (Sect. 5.4).For 12 of the 25 pulsars in DR2, thanks to the extended data and increased sensitivity of the next-generation receivers, we measure several new timing parameters in comparison to DR1.

        <p>PSR J1012+5307 is a 1.8 M ⊙ pulsar in a 14.4 h orbit around a low-mass WD companion (van Kerkwijk et al. 1996;Lazaridis et al. 2009;Antoniadis et al. 2016;Ding et al. 2020;Mata Sánchez et al. 2020). The DR2 dataset for this pulsar now includes more than 5000 TOAs with an average precision of ∼5 µs. Previous mass estimates (Antoniadis et al. 2016) for the system indicate that the expected SD amplitude is now larger than the EPTA timing precision for the pulsar (5 µs × 5000 -1/2 ≃ 0.06 µs).

The columns represent the name of the pulsar, the telescopes that have collected the data, the number of TOAs, the timespan T span of the data set, the median σ TOA in each frequency band, the weighted rms (wrms) of the timing residuals, and the weighted rms after subtracting both red and DM noise (i.e. of the whitened residuals). The corresponding frequency coverage for the P, L, S , and C bands is 0.3-1.0, 1.0-2.0, 2.0-4.0, and 4.0-8.0 GHz, respectively.

For the former system, the SD parameter posteriors are not yet constrained with sufficient precision to provide informative constraints on the pulsar mass. If one considers the mass ratio of the system, q ≡ m p /m c = 10.44(11) (Mata Sánchez et al. 2020), and discards the SD of posterior samples that correspond to physically meaningless values for the companion mass (e.g. m c /M ⊙ ≲ 0.14 or ≳ 0.3), the pulsar mass is constrained to be in the 1.7-2.0 M ⊙ range. As the precision of h 3 and h 4 improves with more data, the SD signature will ultimately provide an independent measurement of the component masses. Combined with the parallax, Ṗb , and WD spectroscopic estimates, this will significantly improve the constraints on gravitational dipole radiation, also providing a valuable test for low-mass WD cooling models.An SD detection for PSRs 1012+5307 and J1022+1001 is reported for the first time.

        <p>For PSR J1022+1001, the posterior distribution of the SD parameters suggests that the pulsar mass is relatively low. For the corresponding constraints on the component masses, the expected magnitude for the relativistic periastron advance is ωGR ≃ 0.01 • yr -1 , which is ∼2.5σ higher than the measured value for this parameter. This can be explained either by an extremely low pulsar mass (∼1 M ⊙ ), or by systematics and non-relativistic contributions to the measured ω.For PSR J1022+1001, the posterior distribution of the SD parameters suggests that the pulsar mass is relatively low.

        <p>Using EPTA DR2, we measured binary orbital period derivatives for a total of ten pulsars. The measurements in PSRs J1022+1001, J1600-3053, J1640+2224, J1713+0747 (all with ≳3σ significance), PSR J1455-3330 (marginal), and J1738+0333 are new compared to those obtained with the EPTA DR1 dataset. Overall, the measured values reported here are consistent with EPTA DR1 (see Table 4), although with improved uncertainties. GW emission causes a change in the orbital period in binary systems (Peters 1964). The observed Ṗb however, may also include extrinsic contributions such as distance-and locationdependent kinematic effects. We determined these extrinsic contributions to the observed Ṗb using the bias-corrected distances given in Table 3. For PSRs J1600-3053, J1909-3744 and J1738+0333, we used the reference parallax values from Reardon et al. (2021), Liu et al. (2020) and Freire et al. (2012), respectively (shown in Table 3).

We also calculated the change in the orbital period by GW damping ( Ṗb,GW ) using the mass estimates presented in Sect. 5.2, where available. We note that here we used the measurement of the SD parameter h 3 and assumed a 1.4 M ⊙ pulsar mass to estimate Ṗb,GW for PSR J0751+1807.

        <p>For PSR J1640+2224, the timing parallax and corresponding distance estimate agree well with those inferred using VLBI measurements (Ding et al. 2023). Therefore, the marginal ∼2.7σ detection of Ṗb,int , which cannot be accounted for by GW damping, is unlikely to be due to an incorrect distance estimate. Although the most probable explanation for the discrepancy is the low-significance measurement of Ṗb,Obs (∼4.9σ), another intriguing explanation could be that the system experiences an additional acceleration due to a nearby object.For PSR J1640+2224, the timing parallax and corresponding distance estimate agree well with those inferred using VLBI measurements (Ding et al. 2023).

        <p>We mapped the KOM-KIN space with the TEMPONEST toolkit, following a scheme similar to described in Desvignes et al. (2016). In detail, we fixed the set of white noise parameters to their maximum likelihood values and chose to analytically marginalise over the spin and astrometric parameters. We set customised uniform linear priors for KOM, KIN and M c . For KIN and M c the prior ranges are set to include all possible values of these parameters that are allowed from the SD measurements (see tables in Appendix B). For KOM the prior range was set from 0 • to 360 • . The sampling was conducted with the constant efficiency option turned off, in order to map the multimodal parameter space more effectively. For PSR J1600-3053, four possible solutions were found in the mapping of KIN and KOM using DR1 dataset The logarithmic likelihood ratio of these two islands is approximately 2.1, which favours the former solution. Thus, there is weak evidence for the detection of the annual orbital parallax signal.We mapped the KOM-KIN space with the TEMPONEST toolkit, following a scheme similar to described in Desvignes et al.

        <p>The full EPTA DR2 dataset, hereafter referred to as "DR2full", is the primary source of data for the pulsar timing analyses presented in this paper, as well as the accompanying articles on the single-pulsar noise analysis (EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration 2023a) and the search for correlated signals in (EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration 2023b). Apart from the DR2full, additional datasets were created, guided by iterative analyses carried out during the detailed investigation of single pulsar noise models in EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration (2023a), as well as multiple analyses carried out to search for artefacts and spurious signals in the common signal searches carried out in EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration (2023b).The full EPTA DR2 dataset, hereafter referred to as "DR2full", is the primary source of data for the pulsar timing analyses presented in this paper, as well as the accompanying articles on the single-pulsar noise analysis (EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration 2023a) and the search for correlated signals in (EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration 2023b).

        <p>The first of these, the 'DR2full+', consists of a combination of the DR2full dataset with the first data release of the InPTA (henceforth InPTA-DR1 Tarafdar et al. 2022) for an overlapping set of 10 pulsars, marked with an asterisk in Table 2. This dataset aims to improve the overall sensitivity of the DR2full to DM-variation linked noise-processes. The combination was performed using the 'narrowband' TOAs from the InPTA-DR1 for two observing bands centred around 500 MHz and 1460 MHz, respectively. Unlike the EPTA data, the InPTA-DR1 data requires optimisation based on the flux density of the pulsar being observed, as well as, observing setup specific details leading to changes in the number of sub-bands generated, ranging from a minimum of 4 to a maximum of 16. We refer interested readers to Tarafdar et al. (2022) for the full details on the InPTA-DR1 data processing. To combine the InPTA-DR1 data with the EPTA DR2 data, for each pulsar we used the ephemeris produced from the EPTA DR2 dataset and followed the same steps as described in Section 3. Specifically, we fitted for phase offset for each subband in the InPTA data individually with respect to the reference system in the EPTA data (see Section 3).The first of these, the 'DR2full+', consists of a combination of the DR2full dataset with the first data release of the InPTA (henceforth InPTA-DR1 Tarafdar et al. 2022) for an overlapping set of 10 pulsars, marked with an asterisk in Table 2.

        <p>The single-pulsar noise analysis of these additional sets of data are presented in EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration (2023a). For the 'DR2full+' dataset, we performed single-pulsar Bayesian timing analysis following the same description as in Section 3.4, using customised noise models determined by EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration (2023a). The results of this analysis were later used for the gravitational wave searches presented in EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration (2023b). A significant difference between the EPTA DR1 and DR2 datasets lies in the use of the technique of coherent dedispersion. This allows for a far more accurate modelling of the frequency-dependent DM delays, leading to the recovery of a sharper profile and thus, improved timing performance. To test the improvements derived from using only coherently dedispersed data, the 'DR2new' dataset was created. This dataset spans, approximately, the final 10.3 yr. Similar to the DR2full dataset, we also appended InPTA-DR1 data to the DR2new to produce the 'DR2new+' dataset.The single-pulsar noise analysis of these additional sets of data are presented in EPTA Collaboration &amp; InPTA Collaboration (2023a).
