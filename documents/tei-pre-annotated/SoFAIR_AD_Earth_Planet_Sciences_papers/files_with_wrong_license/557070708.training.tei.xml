        <p>The DART spacecraft launched on 24 November 2021. The spacecraft carried a narrow-angle imager called the Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation (DRACO), which was used for optical navigation, terminal guidance, and asteroid characterization 8 . DRACO detected Didymos-the primary asteroid in the binary system-in summed optical navigation images 61 days before impact. On 27 August 2022, 30 days before impact, DRACO began taking optical navigation images of Didymos every five hours, which were processed by the ground optical navigation team 9 .</p>
        <p>On 26 September 2022 at 19:09:24 UTC, four hours and five minutes before impact, the spacecraft's autonomous Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real Time Navigation (SMART Nav) system 10 took control of spacecraft navigation (Figure 1a). SMART Nav processed DRACO images onboard 11 to identify Didymos, and once resolved, Dimorphos. To achieve impact with Dimorphos, the spacecraft needed to distinguish between the two asteroids and hit the smaller, dimmer one. Due to the dynamics of the binary system and the spatial resolution of DRACO, it was known that the spacecraft's ultimate target-Dimorphos-would be hidden from DRACO's view during most of the autonomous phase. By design, SMART Nav maneuvered the spacecraft towards Didymos until Dimorphos became reliably detected 10 . SMART Nav first detected Dimorphos 73 minutes prior to impact, and at 50 minutes prior to impact, SMART Nav began maneuvering towards Dimorphos (Figure 1). As planned, SMART Nav maneuvering ended at 23:11:52 UTC, 2.5 minutes before impact, to give the spacecraft time to settle to minimize jitter and smear in final images. The spacecraft impacted Dimorphos at 23:14:24.183 ± 0.004 UTC (see methods). From the start of autonomous navigation until impact, the spacecraft continuously streamed images to the ground, which were immediately broadcast to the public.</p>
        <p>The final full image was acquired 1.818 seconds before impact and has a pixel scale of 5.5 cm.</p>
        <p>The final image received on the ground was a partial image acquired 0.855 seconds before impact with a pixel scale of 2.6 cm.</p>
        <p>Little was known about the shape or surface of Dimorphos until DRACO obtained highresolution images. Ground-based radar observations 12 led to a diameter estimate of 150±30 m.</p>
        <p>Analysis of telescopic photometric observations yielded a comparable diameter for Dimorphos, 171±11 m 13,14 . Although DRACO imaged only a portion of Dimorphos, and illumination was limited at 60° solar phase, the images were used to construct an asteroid shape model (see methods). The shape model revealed Dimorphos to be an oblate spheroid with a volumeequivalent diameter of 151± 5 m (Table 1; Figure 2; Extended Data Fig. 1). Dimorphos's shape is unusual relative to other near-Earth asteroids visited by spacecraft [15][16][17][18][19] and differs from other binary asteroid secondaries observed to date that have measured elongations [20][21][22][23] . However, oblate secondaries show little or no measurable lightcurve amplitude, which biases the observational sample toward elongated secondaries. A new size estimate for Didymos from DRACO images (Table 1) (see methods) combined with previous telescopic observations 4 enables calculation of a more accurate visible (0.55 µm) geometric albedo for the system of 0.15 ± 0.02. This value is on the low side, but within one sigma, of the mean geometric albedo for Stype asteroids 24 .</p>
        <p>The spacecraft trajectory and pointing were reconstructed to locate the impact site (see methods)</p>
        <p>(Figure 2). The spacecraft impacted Dimorphos at 8.84 ± 0.45º S, 264.30 ± 0.47º E, within 25 m of the center of the figure, which is very near the scenario for maximizing momentum transfer</p>
        <p>with an impact through the center of figure 25 . The one-sigma uncertainty in the impact site location is ± 68 cm (see methods), which is smaller than the size of the spacecraft bus (Figure 3).</p>
        <p>The impact angle was 73 ± 7º degrees from local horizontal (see methods and Extended Data Fig. 2). The impact site was near two large boulders, labeled boulder 1 (6.5-m long and at its highest point standing ~2.2 m above the surrounding terrain; see Extended Data Figure 3) and boulder 2 (6.1-m long and at its highest point standing ~1.6 m above the surrounding terrain; see Extended Data Figure 3) in Figure 2b and 2c. The spacecraft approached the asteroid with its solar arrays canted slightly toward the surface (Figure 3). The leading edge of the +Y solar array contacted the surface of boulder 1, and this solar array directly hit boulder 1 (Figure 3). Almost immediately thereafter, the -Y solar array grazed boulder 2, with the leading edge of the -Y array contacting the surface near the base of boulder 2 in downrange direction (Figure 3). Finally, the spacecraft bus hit between boulders 1 and 2 (Figure 3). Although the solar arrays contacted Dimorphos just prior to the spacecraft bus, the bulk of the spacecraft's energy was transferred by the bus, which accounted for ~88% of the spacecraft mass at the time of impact.</p>
        <p>DART images of Dimorphos revealed a boulder-strewn surface (Figure 2a, Extended Data Figs.</p>
        <p>4 and 5) resembling other small NEAs, such as the S-type (25143) Itokawa 17 , and carbonaceous asteroids (101955) Bennu 26 , and (162173) Ryugu 16 , suggesting a rubble-pile structure for Dimorphos. The boulder-rich nature of the surface is apparent in images as coarse as 2-3 m pixel scale (Extended Data Fig. 4). No unambiguous impact crater candidates are observed, which indicates a young surface, though craters can be difficult to identify on boulder-covered terrains [27][28][29][30] . The appearance of Dimorphos contrasts with impressions from lower-resolution</p>
        <p>images of the Didymos surface, where regional roughness variations are apparent (Extended Data Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>The final complete DRACO image captured a ~880 m 2 area surrounding the impact site at a 5.5cm pixel scale. The impact region (Figure 2b) exhibits blocky terrain resembling the rest of the observed hemisphere (Figure 2a; Extended Data Fig. 4 and5). There is evidence for variation within boulders, "rocks on rocks" similar to observations on Bennu 31 , and partially buried boulders (Extended Data Fig. 5). The longest axes of boulders counted in the final complete image are 0.16 m to 6.5 m in length. The impact region has fewer boulders in the 0.2-0.5 m size range than expected if the cumulative distribution followed a single power-law, even though the pixel scale of the image is sufficient for their identification (Extended Data Fig. 6). There is no evidence for expansive smooth deposits (grain size smaller than the image pixel scale) such as those seen on Itokawa 17 . The blocky nature of the impact site likely influenced crater formation, ejecta, and momentum enhancement, as seen in impact experiments 28,[32][33][34] , numerical simulations 25,35 , and the Small Carry-on Impactor experiment on Hayabusa2 5 .</p>
        <p>DART did not measure the mass of Dimorphos. Instead, Dimorphos's mass is estimated using the orbital properties of the binary system, the total volume of the system, and an assumption that Didymos and Dimorphos have equal bulk densities (see methods). This assumption cannot be rigorously tested from DART data, but this approach leads to a bulk density of Dimorphos of 2400 kg/m 3 (Table 1) with difficult-to-quantify uncertainties.</p>
        <p>Based on analyses of reflectance spectra, the best meteoritic analogs for Didymos are L and LL chondrites 36,37 . L and LL chondrites have grain densities 38 of 3580 ± 10 kg/m 3 and 3520 ± 10 kg/m 3 , respectively. If one assumes Dimorphos has the same composition as Didymos and that these meteorite values represent the grain density of Dimorphos, then a bulk density of ~2400 kg/m 3 implies a Dimorphos bulk porosity of order 30% (with a difficult-to-quantify uncertainty; see methods). This level of bulk porosity is not inconsistent with a rubble-pile structure for Dimorphos, a structure suggested by the boulder-rich character of Dimorphos's surface. This bulk porosity likely exists as a combination of macroporosity between pieces of rubble and microporosity within individual pieces of rubble. L and LL chondrite samples have porosities of 8.0 ± 0.3% and 9.5 ± 0.6%, respectively 38 , which would imply that macroporosity is substantial on Dimorphos. Estimates of the density and porosity of Dimorphos will be significantly improved when ESA's Hera mission arrives at the Didymos system in early 2027 39 .</p>
        <p>DART's successful autonomous targeting of a small asteroid with limited prior knowledge is a key first accomplishment on the path to advancing kinetic impactor technology to an operational capability. DART's impact indicates that a precursor reconnaissance mission is not a prerequisite for intercepting a sub-kilometer asteroid, though the characterization done by a precursor A</p>
        <p>The time of impact was computed from spacecraft clock timestamps inserted into each downlinked telemetry frame by the spacecraft's radio. A new telemetry frame was produced every 2.9853 milliseconds with a precision of 20 microseconds. Assuming the impact occurred in the middle of the frame after the final received frame placed the time of impact to within ± half a frame period: This time is the UTC of the impact at Dimorphos, not the time on Earth when the last telemetry frame was received. As each DRACO image is timestamped with a spacecraft clock value, the time to impact for each image can be computed with similar accuracy.</p>
        <p>We built the shape model using stereophotoclinometry (SPC), a technique that has been widely used to model the shape of small bodies [40][41][42] . Prior to DART's impact, the shape modeling team conducted tests to understand the strengths and limitations of the SPC approach given the data expected from DART 43 . DART images pose a challenge for any image-based shape modeling technique due to the single viewing geometry and lighting condition. SPC provides robust results despite these challenges 43 .</p>
        <p>Extended Data Fig. 7 illustrates the steps used to build the Dimorphos shape model. First, we used DRACO images to determine the dimensions of an initial triaxial ellipsoid. The ellipsoid was constrained by the location of the sunlit limb, the location of the limb lit by light scattered off Didymos, and the position of the terminator. Together, the sunlit and Didymos-lit limbs revealed the complete extents of the X and Z axes of Dimorphos (Extended Data Fig. 8). The position of the terminator constrained the Y-axis extent. The last DRACO image to contain all of Dimorphos in the field of view was registered to the ellipsoid. Other DRACO images were registered to that image or, in the case of the highest-resolution images of the impact site, to the immediately preceding image. In order to correctly determine the scale of the shape model, we used the known time of impact and spacecraft speed to set the spacecraft range for each image.</p>
        <p>Next, we pursued parallel paths (Extended Data Fig. 7). The first path used standard SPC processes to construct small digital terrain models (called "maplets") using an SPC program called lithos 40,42,43 . Maplets were tiled all across the surface of the asteroid in the areas seen by DRACO. Maplets went through several iterations to compute the maplet topography 40,42,43 . After several iterations, the maplet ensemble was averaged to create a global digital terrain model (DTM). Areas without maplet coverage remained unchanged. This cycle was repeated with maplets of increasingly finer ground-sample distances (GSD) in the areas covered by higherresolution images surrounding the impact site. The finest-scale maplets had a GSD of 3 cm, comparable to the pixel scale of the final, partial DRACO image. The second path focused on matching the sunlit limb. We built maplets along the sunlit limb that were conditioned by limb points identified in the tilt-to-height integration in an SPC iteration. These maplets were made at only two ground-sample distances due to the coarser resolution of images that contained limb.</p>
        <p>Once the topography in the standard maplets and limb-only maplets stabilized, we united them via several SPC iterations and proceeded to build the global DTM.</p>
        <p>The areas covered by maplets on Dimorphos global DTM are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1 as shaded gray regions. The blue and magenta points show the locations of the sunlit and Didymoslit limbs. The unseen side of the asteroid is roughly centered on the 90° East view. The shape model has the volume and extents reported in Table 1. The global DTM has a typical GSD of 26 centimeters, but that resolution is only meaningful in the areas covered by maplets.</p>
        <p>We also used the standard maplets to construct a DTM of the impact site. The impact site is covered by the highest-resolution images, so the impact site can support finer-scale topography than the global model. The impact site DTM has a GSD of 5 cm and is shown in</p>
        <p>We quantified uncertainties in the global DTM of Dimorphos using techniques employed to estimate the uncertainties associated with the global DTM of Bennu 44 . These techniques were also used to assess uncertainties in shape models developed during pre-impact tests done for DART 43 . The analyses involved comparing DRACO images against the global DTM when rendered with the same lighting and viewing geometry as the image. We used three analyses described in the above references. The first method, referred to as the limb/terminator method, used image thresholding to identify limb and terminator in the DRACO image and rendered shape model. The thresholded images were subtracted to reveal mismatches between the image and rendered shape model and any size bias in the model (Extended Data Fig. 9a-9e). The second and third methods relied on analysis of corresponding surface features, or keypoints, in images and the rendered shape model, to understand errors in the overall size of the shape model (Extended Data Fig. 9f-9i). In the second method, referred to as keypoint matching, the rendered image was rotated, translated, and scaled to minimize differences in keypoint locations on the DRACO image and rendered shape model. The third method, referred to as keypoint distance,</p>
        <p>was based on the measured distances between all keypoints in the DRACO image and rendered shape model.</p>
        <p>The limb/terminator assessments indicated that the model is 75 cm too small in X, Y, and Z, with a limb uncertainty of 1.3 -2 m. Most of the mismatch between DRACO images and the rendered shape model occurred along the limb and terminator. We expected larger uncertainties in these areas due to the limited coverage and single lighting condition in DRACO images. The keypoints indicated that the Dimorphos shape model is 6 ± 29 cm too large and that features in the model have point-separation errors of -11 ± 20 cm. The keypoint assessments indicated that the model performed well in areas where DRACO resolved detailed surface features, which is the area of the model that is most relevant to understanding the topography of the impact site. Comparisons between shadow lengths in DRACO images and shadow lengths in shape model renderings indicated that some boulder heights are too small. This mismatch was expected based on shape modeling tests done for DART and is a consequence of constructing the shape model from a single lighting condition and viewing geometry 43 . Shadow lengths suggest that height of boulder 1 in the impact site DTM is ~10% too small, but the height of boulder 2 in the impact site DTM is correct. Based on all of these analyses, we assumed uncertainties of two meters in the extents of Dimorphos in the X and Z directions.</p>
        <p>Because DRACO saw a complete outline of the asteroid (Extended Data Figure 8) and the spacecraft approach geometry was such that this outline was primarily in the X-Z plane, the shape model dimension uncertainties in X and Z are less than 1% (Table 1). Hence, the Y-axis extent is the largest source of uncertainty in the volume. Future work will refine the errors in the</p>
        <p>and Z (i.e., 4 meters).</p>
        <p>Measuring the volume of Dimorphos and realistically estimating uncertainties on that quantity is of particular interest because it directly affects our understanding of the mass of the asteroid. In the shape modeling tests 43 , we took scaled shape models of an ellipsoid, Itokawa, and Bennu, rendered a set of simulated DRACO images from the "truth" shape models, and then used SPC to build shape models from simulated images 43 . We compared the volumes of the models built using SPC against the volumes of truth models 43 . The volume errors in those tests ranged from -2% to +23% 43 . The test with the lowest volume error was for an ellipsoidal asteroid. The roughly ellipsoidal shape of Dimorphos as seen by DRACO suggests that the volume error in the Dimorphos global DTM is likely on the order of several percent, rather than 23%, by virtue of the simplicity of Dimorphos's long-wavelength shape. Moreover, in the tests with the largest volume errors, the terminator of the shape model-which is the primary constraint on the extent of the shape into and out of the page-did not match the terminator of the original images. In the case of Dimorphos, the terminator matched nicely between the global DTM and the rendered shape model (Extended Data Figure 9). Given the results from the shape modeling tests 43 , this agreement indicated that the volume errors for Dimorphos are likely on the order of several percent. Based on these assessments, a volume error of 5% seems probable. But, we adopted a volume uncertainty of 10% to be conservative. This volume error is larger than the value implied by the reported uncertainties in the X, Y, and Z extents, but the intent is to be conservative.</p>
        <p>A preliminary SPC shape model of Didymos was built from DRACO data. This model led to the preliminary volume and extent of Didymos reported in Table 1. DRACO images revealed a smaller Z-axis and showed that the visible portion of the X-axis likely needs to be extended by a few tens of meters compared to a radar-derived shape model 12 . We used the techniques employed to estimate shape model uncertainties described in the "Shape modeling of Dimorphos" section to assess the preliminary SPC shape model of Didymos. Because the full Xand Z-extents of Didymos cannot be measured in DRACO images (in contrast to Dimorphos), we conservatively attributed an uncertainty of 15 m to the lengths of all the axes of Didymos.</p>
        <p>The construction of an SPC shape model produced a set of surface landmarks that were used to determine the location (at the time of each image) of the spacecraft relative to the surface in the Dimorphos body fixed frame. This procedure used the spacecraft's Didymos relative velocity computed by the ground navigation team using a combination of radiometric tracking data (Doppler, range) and optical images of Didymos. We used this information and the shape model of Dimorphos to compute the location of the impact site. The positions of the DART spacecraft from SPC were converted to the inertial J2000 frame and corrected for light time and aberration.</p>
        <p>The velocity of the spacecraft was estimated by fitting a second-order polynomial function to these positions as a function of time. This approach is identical to that employed previously 45 to estimate the position of the Hayabusa spacecraft relative to Itokawa. We used the locations from the last 14 complete images collected by DART to determine the spacecraft velocity. These images contained large numbers of landmarks due to their fine pixel scales, which help anchor</p>
        <p>the spacecraft position for each image. The fit residuals (i.e., the difference between the fit of the spacecraft location to that determined from SPC) are &lt; 1m (Extended Data Figure 10).</p>
        <p>We combined our estimated velocity and the SPC-derived spacecraft positions of the last five images to determine the impact location. Only the last five images were used to locate the impact because heater cycling on the spacecraft introduced cyclic error rates in the inertial attitude knowledge. These rates were estimated to be small at the time of impact due to the timing of impact relative to heater cycling but at their highest approximately 30 seconds prior to impact.</p>
        <p>Using only the last few images reduced the influence of this known (and cumulative) error source. At each of these five spacecraft positions, we propagated the velocity vector until it intersected with the surface of the Dimorphos shape model. We took the mean of these positions as the impact location. We also computed the spacecraft state at a few different heights above the intersection point in order to determine the order in which the solar arrays and bus contacted the surface. The propagation from each of the last five images provided the same impact point to within 1 cm. The uncertainties in the impact point location (reported in Table 1) are dominated by the residuals to the fits of the spacecraft position obtained by SPC in the Y and Z directions (Extended Data Figure 10).</p>
        <p>The tilt angle of the surface relative to the impact velocity vector defines the impact angle.</p>
        <p>Because the impact site DTM resolves topography at a 5-cm GSD, the spacecraft bus would have interacted with on the order of a thousand facets of the DTM. Therefore, we calculated a mean tilt with respect to the impact velocity vector for each facet in the impact site DTM. The mean</p>
        <p>tilt calculation is based on previous work 41 ; however, we computed mean tilt with respect to the impact velocity vector, v, rather than the radial vector to a given facet to determine the impact angle.</p>
        <p>The magnitude of the mean tilt for a facet at the impact point is the angle between v and the average normal, nav, which is the weighted average of the normal vectors of all facets in the userdefined region, nav=∑(ni Ai )/∑Ai surrounding the impact point. In this study, this region was 1.5 m in radius in order to exceed the size of the spacecraft bus. The normal vector of each facet in the region of interest, ni, was weighted by Ai, the area of the facet projected onto a best-fit plane to the region selected to determine the surface tilt. This yields a mean tilt = acos(nav . v /|nav||v|). Impact angle, θ, which is typically defined relative to the local horizontal for planetary impacts, is given by θ =90-(mean tilt). The impact angle shown in Table 1 is computed from the mean tilt and θ of the facet closest to the impact point.</p>
        <p>As discussed in the "Impact site identification" section, the location of the impact site has an uncertainty of ±68 cm. To understand the range of mean tilts that DART may have encountered given the uncertainty in the impact location, we considered the distribution of mean tilt for all facets within a circle with radius 68 cm centered on the impact site (Extended Data Figure 2).</p>
        <p>The standard deviation of this distribution was 7° (one sigma), which we attributed as the uncertainty of the impact angle DART may have experienced.</p>
        <p>The longest axis of each boulder in the final full DRACO image was identified as a line (as done for asteroid (101955) Bennu 46 . The length of the longest axis was determined from the line length and image pixel scale, assuming the last full image as a "flat" scene. The total number of boulders and pebbles identified in the final full DRACO image impact site is 953 and range in size (that is, length of the longest axis) from 0.16 (limit of image resolution, assuming ≥3 pixel sampling 47 ) to 6.5 m. The resulting size-frequency distribution is presented in Extended Data Figure 6.</p>
        <p>To first order, the combined system mass, Msys, was estimated using Kepler's 3rd law,</p>
        <p>where a and P are the pre-impact semimajor axis and orbit period, and G is the gravitational constant. Neglecting the aspherical shapes of Didymos and Dimorphos and their associated gravitational potentials may lead to an overestimate of the system mass by ~1-2% 48 . However, this error is negligible as the uncertainty in Dimorphos's semimajor axis dominates the uncertainty in the system mass. Next, the bulk density of the combined system was obtained by dividing the system mass with the combined volume of both bodies,</p>
        <p>where RA and RB are the respective volume-equivalent radii of Didymos and Dimorphos. Based on the pre-impact orbit period and semimajor axis 6 , and the volume-equivalent diameters provided in this work, we calculated a nominal system bulk density of 2400 ± 250 kg/m 3 using the uncertainties quoted in the previous sentence. However, in order to represent additional possible systematic uncertainties, we adopted a slightly larger uncertainty, which gives a system bulk density of 2400 ± 300 kg/m 3 .</p>
        <p>The porosity of Dimorphos was estimated as follows:</p>
        <p>f=1-(rbulk/rgrain)</p>
        <p>In this work, we assumed that Dimorphos's bulk density matches the entire system's bulk density. There are three NEA systems for which the satellite's bulk density has been independently measured: 66391 Moshup, 2000 DP107, and 2001 SN263 (two satellites). Two of those satellites (Squannit and 2001 SN263 gamma) were measured to be denser than the primary and two were less dense (2001 SN263 beta and 2000 DP107 beta) [20][21][22] . For all three systems, the 1-sigma uncertainties for the satellite and the primary densities overlap. Furthermore, recent work 49 estimated that the size of Squannit is about 30% larger than estimated previously 20 , meaning that the bulk density of Squannit may be in better agreement with its primary. Given these other examples, assuming Dimorphos's density matches the system bulk density is a reasonable starting point, although its true density could differ significantly from this value. Hera will determine the masses and densities of Didymos and Dimorphos and test the validity of this assumption 39 . distributions estimated after fitting the spacecraft locations obtained during the SPC shape modeling process with a second-order polynomial all in the J2000 inertial frame relative to Dimorphos. Uncertainties attributed to the location of the impact site and reported in Table 1 are in the Y and Z axes.</p>
