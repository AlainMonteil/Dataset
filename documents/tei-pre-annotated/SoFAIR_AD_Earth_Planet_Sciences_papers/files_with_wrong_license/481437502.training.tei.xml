        <p>Seagrasses are valuable sources of food and habitat for marine life and are one of Earth's most efficient carbon sinks. However, they are facing a global decline due to ocean warming and eutrophication. In the last decade, with the advent of new technology and molecular advances, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies focusing on the effects of ocean warming on seagrasses. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the future of seagrasses in an era of ocean warming. We have gathered information from published studies to identify potential commonalities in the effects of warming and the responses of seagrasses across four distinct levels: molecular, biochemical/physiological, morphological/population, and ecosystem/planetary. To date, we know that although warming strongly affects seagrasses at all four levels, seagrass responses diverge amongst species, populations, and over depths. Furthermore, warming alters seagrass distribution causing massive die-offs in some seagrass populations, whilst also causing tropicalization and migration of temperate species. In this review, we evaluate the combined effects of ocean warming with other environmental stressors and emphasize the need for multiple-stressor studies to provide a deeper understanding of seagrass resilience. We conclude by discussing the most significant knowledge gaps and future directions for seagrass research.Seagrasses are valuable sources of food and habitat for marine life and are one of Earth's most efficient carbon sinks.

        <p>(1) Global warming is happening at an alarming rate Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid-18th century, human activities have been continuously releasing billions of tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere (e.g. 10.4 billion tons in 2011). This has resulted in a massive increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration from 280 ppm in the 1700s (Monastersky, 2013) to over 419 ppm at the beginning of 2021 (https://www.co2.earth/) contributing to the greenhouse effect (Anderson, Hawkins &amp; Jones, 2016). This human-induced phenomenon has led to irreversible changes to the Earth's climate, with global warming the strongest consequence (Solomon et al., 2009;Shakun et al., 2012): the temperature of the Earth's surface increased by 0.61 C ± 0.16 C between 1861 and 2000 (Keller, 2009). Exceeding the tipping point of 1.5 C above pre-industrial global temperature level is predicted to cause irreversible global-ecosystem shifts that will challenge the existence of millions of species, including humans (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018;Lenton et al., 2019). Global warming is not only reflected by a pronounced upward trend in the average global temperature, but also by an increased frequency of extreme thermal events (i.e. heatwaves) (Meehl &amp; Tebaldi, 2004;Christidis, Jones &amp; Stott, 2015). For instance, the European heatwave of 2003 was one of the most significant examples of such abnormal climatic events with extremely hot and dry weather causing widespread environmental, economic, and social consequences (Schär &amp; Jendritzky, 2004).(1) Global warming is happening at an alarming rate Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the mid-18th century, human activities have been continuously releasing billions of tons of CO 2 into the atmosphere (e.g. 10.4 billion tons in 2011).

        <p>Covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean plays a fundamental role in the Earth's climate, and is a habitat for an estimated 50-80% of all life on Earth. Global warming is also affecting the ocean, which is warming at an alarming rate, especially in coastal areas, where the temperature increase has been reported as 0.17 C ±0.11 C/decade (Liao et al., 2015). In semi-closed seas (e.g. the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea), the rate is even faster (Nguyen et al., 2020b).Covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, the ocean plays a fundamental role in the Earth's climate, and is a habitat for an estimated 50-80% of all life on Earth.

        <p>In the sea, thermal conditions are more stable than on land (except for the intertidal zone). Recent studies have documented a rapid rise in the occurrence of extreme climatic events in the ocean, known as marine heatwaves (MHWs) (Oliver et al., 2018). MHWs are extreme warm periods that last for at least 5 days with a temperature level exceeding the 90th percentile, based on three-decade historical baseline temperature values (Hobday et al., 2016). Ocean warming, and especially MHWs, is already having catastrophic consequences in coastal benthic communities worldwide (Coma et al., 2009;Harley et al., 2012;Wernberg et al., 2016). Indeed, the impact of MHWs is of more concern than the increase in average seawater temperature, because organisms are generally more vulnerable to sudden temperature changes than to progressive ones (Smale et al., 2019). Thus, MHWs may trigger destructive chronic impacts on marine creatures that can result in shifts in species distributions and even local extinctions (Easterling et al., 2000).In the sea, thermal conditions are more stable than on land (except for the intertidal zone).

        <p>(2) Seagrasses are being impacted by ocean warming Seagrasses are a unique group of angiosperms that recolonized the marine realm 60-90 million years ago on at least three occasions (Les, Cleland &amp; Waycott, 1997). To overcome the numerous challenges presented by a submerged lifestyle in the marine environment, seagrasses have developed a range of specialized adaptive characteristics (Invers, Perez &amp; Romero, 1999;Borum et al., 2007;Wissler et al., 2011;Hogarth, 2015;Olsen et al., 2016). Consisting of a surprisingly small number of species (60-70 species in total), seagrasses are distributed across thousands of kilometres of sedimentary shorelines from sub-Artic to tropical regions (Short et al., 2007). They provide highly valuable socio-economic services, including primary productivity, organic carbon sequestration and burial, as well as sediment stabilization (Orth et al., 2006;Fourqurean et al., 2012;Bertelli &amp; Unsworth, 2014;Unsworth, Nordlund &amp; Cullen-Unsworth, 2019). They also provide nursery habitats for fish and a diversity of marine organisms (e.g. invertebrates). Seagrasses represent one of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth with an estimated value of $1.9 trillion per annum (Waycott et al., 2009;Costanza et al., 2014). Furthermore, they have been acknowledged as one of Earth's most efficient carbon sinks, and are listed as one of the potential solutions to mitigate CO 2 emissions and ultimately to address the threat of global warming (Gattuso et al., 2018).(2) Seagrasses are being impacted by ocean warming Seagrasses are a unique group of angiosperms that recolonized the marine realm 60-90 million years ago on at least three occasions (Les, Cleland &amp; Waycott, 1997).

        <p>Despite their critical value, they are suffering a global decline, driven mainly by the growing number of pressures linked directly to human activities (e.g. ocean warming, coastal modification, water quality degradation) (Orth et al., 2006;Waycott et al., 2009). Globally, seagrasses are disappearing at an alarming rate of 110 km 2 per annum, resulting in a cumulative loss of 29% of the total world seagrass population by the end of 2006 (Waycott et al., 2009). The total population of Posidonia oceanica, for example, a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, has decreased by 13-50% since the mid-nineteenth century (Telesca et al., 2015). However, the rate of seagrass loss, at least at a regional scale, seems to have been reduced as a result of the implementation of management plans, such as European environmental protection measures (de los Santos et al., 2019).Despite their critical value, they are suffering a global decline, driven mainly by the growing number of pressures linked directly to human activities (e.g. ocean warming, coastal modification, water quality degradation) (Orth et al., 2006;Waycott et al., 2009).

        <p>A recent study listed seagrasses as one of the habitatforming species that are likely to disappear as a consequence of climate change (Trisos, Merow &amp; Pigot, 2020). Seagrass die-offs, as a consequence of MHWs, have been reported for different species, including P. oceanica (Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2010), Zostera marina (Reusch et al., 2005;Jarvis, Brush &amp; Moore, 2014), and Amphibolis antarctica (Seddon, Connolly &amp; Edyvane, 2000;Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018;Strydom et al., 2020). The observed mass mortality of several seagrass populations after extreme MHWs (Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018;Strydom et al., 2020) and the projected warming trend for the next decades has motivated the prediction of a functional extinction of seagrass meadows in the near future (Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2010;Jordà, Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2012;Chefaoui, Duarte &amp; Serrão, 2018). Interestingly, while MHWs have already caused extensive local extinction of seaweed species across hundreds of kilometres (Smale, 2020), the comparative effects on seagrasses might appear to be smaller. This suggests that further research investigating the mechanisms driving potential differences in the resilience between seagrasses and other marine macrophytes is clearly needed.A recent study listed seagrasses as one of the habitatforming species that are likely to disappear as a consequence of climate change (Trisos, Merow &amp; Pigot, 2020).

        <p>Over the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in the number of studies documenting the impact of warming on seagrasses as well as the responses of seagrasses to this environmental challenge (Fig. 1). These studies have investigated the response of seagrasses to warming at the biological level (i.e. biochemical, physiological and morphological), and also at the molecular, population and even ecosystem/planetary level (Fig. 1). A review on the effects of warming on seagrasses is timely since: (i) ocean warming is occurring at an alarming rate and will continue to have strong impacts on seagrasses in the future; (ii) a substantial amount of information on the effects of warming on seagrasses has become available recently; and (iii) there is no comprehensive review on the effects of ocean warming on seagrasses [but see Bulthuis, 1987;Lee, Park &amp; Kim, 2007a;Koch et al., 2013;Duarte et al., 2018]. This review focuses on the effects of warming on seagrasses across different functional levels (molecular, biochemical/physiological, morphological/population and ecosystem/planetary), describes the effects of warming on seagrasses in combination with other stressors (e.g. salinity, light, etc.), and suggests future research directions to close knowledge gaps in our understanding of seagrass resilience in a changing climate.Over the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in the number of studies documenting the impact of warming on seagrasses as well as the responses of seagrasses to this environmental challenge (Fig. 1).

        <p>In the face of rapid ocean warming, it is critically important to predict the future responses of seagrasses in order to develop mitigation strategies to prevent their loss through effective management, conservation, and restoration. The molecular basis of seagrass responses to a warming ocean can uncover seagrass traits that can be correlated to the persistence of that species under changing climatic conditions (Procaccini, Olsen &amp; Reusch, 2007;Reusch &amp; Wood, 2007).

        <p>To date, gene expression studies (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing) have been conducted for only a handful of seagrass species. Large transcriptomic differences observed in seagrasses that had recovered from longterm acute temperature stress (3 weeks at 26 C) identified transcriptomic resilience as a predictor of thermal adaptation (Franssen et al., 2011;Jueterbock et al., 2016). Other studies found different transcriptomic responses to short-term acute stress (5 days, 32 C), leading to the identification of molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining photosynthetic stability and respiratory acclimation of seagrasses under heat stress (Marín-Guirao et al., 2017). Investigations of the responses of seagrasses to thermal stress have revealed some interspecific similarities (see Fig. 2), comparable to those observed in the heat response of terrestrial plants, including refolding of proteins, activation of oxidative-stress defence, and cell wall fortification (Franssen et al., 2011(Franssen et al., , 2014;;Gu et al., 2012;Jueterbock et al., 2016;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2017).To date, gene expression studies (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing) have been conducted for only a handful of seagrass species.

        <p>(a) Heat shock proteins Seagrasses have developed several sophisticated molecular mechanisms to respond to environmental triggers. Among these mechanisms, the production of chaperones, especially heat shock proteins (HSPs) are among the most important. HSPs are common proteins found in both plants and animals. They play fundamental roles in cells under normal and stressed conditions, including roles in protein folding, assembly, translocation, and protein degradation (Vierling, 1991;Kiang &amp; Tsokos, 1998;Park &amp; Seo, 2015).

        <p>Multiple studies have highlighted the role of molecular chaperones (especially HSPs) in seagrass responses to warming (Reusch et al., 2008;Bergmann et al., 2010;Franssen et al., 2011, 2014;Massa et al., 2011;Gu et al., 2012;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2017;Malandrakis et al., 2017;Tutar et al., 2017;Traboni et al., 2018;Purnama et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2020b). HSP70 and HSP90 are the best studied chaperones in seagrasses. In terrestrial plants, heat shock factors (HSFs) act as transcriptional activators of HSPs and some have a critical role in plant thermal tolerance (Qu et al., 2013). It remains mostly unclear whether HSFs have the same role in seagrasses compared with terrestrial plants, although some of these genes have been shown to be responsive in at least two seagrass species (Zostera noltii and P. oceanica) when exposed to rapid and severe heat stress (Massa et al., 2011;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016).Multiple studies have highlighted the role of molecular chaperones (especially HSPs) in seagrass responses to warming (Reusch et al., 2008;Bergmann et al., 2010;Franssen et al., 2011, 2014;Massa et al., 2011;Gu et al., 2012;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2017;Malandrakis et al., 2017;Tutar et al., 2017;Traboni et al., 2018;Purnama et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2020b).

        <p>Oxidative stress, generated by the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under increased temperatures, is a common secondary stress response in plants (Hasanuzzaman, Nahar &amp; Fujita, 2013). Gene expression studies in different seagrass species strongly support the involvement of genes encoding ROS-scavengers, indicating the production of ROS in seagrasses during thermal stress (Reusch et al., 2008;Winters et al., 2011;Gu et al., 2012;Liu et al., 2016;Marín-Guirao et al., 2017;Tutar et al., 2017;Purnama et al., 2019). In seagrasses, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) appear to be among the most active ROS-scavenging enzymes under heat stress (Reusch et al., 2008;Winters et al., 2011;Liu et al., 2016;Marín-Guirao et al., 2017;Purnama et al., 2019).

        <p>Using a metabolomics approach, Gu et al. (2012) detected myo-inositol among the three most responsive metabolites to oxidative stress in two seagrass species (Z. marina and Z. noltii) subjected to heat stress. In terrestrial plants, myo-inositol is important in the galactinol and raffinose biosynthetic pathways that have been characterized as osmoprotectants. These osmoprotectants can function as scavengers of ROS (Nishizawa, Yabuta &amp; Shigeoka, 2008) whereas myo-inositol alone has been found to increase the midpoint denaturation temperature of proteins (Ortbauer &amp; Popp, 2008).Using a metabolomics approach, Gu et al.

        <p>Apart from HSPs and ROS-scavenging proteins, other mechanisms by which seagrasses respond to warming have been discovered in recent molecular studies. Gu et al. (2012) on Z. marina andTraboni et al. (2018) on P. oceanica revealed the involvement of ubiquitination and proteolysis in response to thermal stress, indicative of severe protein damage as a consequence of elevated temperature. In terrestrial plants, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is a multi-step process that identifies, labels, and destroys damaged proteins. It is the principal mechanism of protein catabolism to facilitate plant proteostasis when exposed to stressful conditions (reviewed by Stone, 2014). The cell wall is fundamentally important for the survival and development of plants as it provides a structural framework and is the first line of defence against pathogens. Moreover, cell wall modification can enhance plant responses to many environmental stressors (reviewed by Houston et al., 2016). In seagrasses, transcriptomic studies revealed higher expression of cell wall-related genes in plants exposed to thermal stress, suggesting the potential involvement of cell wall fortification in the thermal stress response as in terrestrial plants (Gu et al., 2012;Franssen et al., 2014;Jueterbock et al., 2016;Marín-Guirao et al., 2017, 2019).Apart from HSPs and ROS-scavenging proteins, other mechanisms by which seagrasses respond to warming have been discovered in recent molecular studies.

        <p>Warming can have detrimental effects on the translational machinery of seagrasses, by limiting the availability of associated molecular components (Malandrakis et al., 2017) with destructive consequences on the organization of the cytoskeleton (Massa et al., 2011;Malandrakis et al., 2017;Tutar et al., 2017) which can in turn damage cell division processes (Malandrakis et al., 2017;Marín-Guirao et al., 2017). Furthermore, warming can diminish the expression of pathogen defence genes, thereby potentially enhancing susceptibility to disease (Jueterbock et al., 2016) although experimental evidence to date suggests the contrary (see Section II.5f ). Given the past massive die-off of seagrass meadows due to 'wasting disease' (Orth et al., 2006), the combined effects of warming and disease deserve further investigation.Warming can have detrimental effects on the translational machinery of seagrasses, by limiting the availability of associated molecular components (Malandrakis et al., 2017) with destructive consequences on the organization of the cytoskeleton (Massa et al., 2011;Malandrakis et al., 2017;Tutar et al., 2017) which can in turn damage cell division processes (Malandrakis et al., 2017;Marín-Guirao et al., 2017).

Under severe conditions, seagrasses activate apoptotic pathways by upregulating expression levels of genes involved in the programmed cell death process aimed at eliminating irreparably damaged cells (Massa et al., 2011;Tutar et al., 2017;Traboni et al., 2018). This apoptotic mechanism is also connected with the production of HSPs (Beere, 2005).Warming causes damage to DNA and protein structure (e.g. protein unfolding, protein degradation) in seagrasses, resulting in homeostatic cell imbalance and cell death (Franssen et al., 2011;Tutar et al., 2017).

        <p>(d) Intraspecific differences in molecular responses to warming amongst seagrass populations from different thermal origins Seagrass populations from different thermal origins respond differently to warming. Plants living in more fluctuating and/or warmer environments are more resilient to warming than those from colder and/or more stable thermal environments. Examples include Z. marina from different latitudes (Bergmann et al., 2010;Franssen et al., 2011;Winters et al., 2011;Jueterbock et al., 2016;Jahnke et al., 2019), P. oceanica from different depths (Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2017;Procaccini et al., 2017;Tutar et al., 2017) and latitudes (Marín-Guirao et al., 2019), and Halophila stipulacea from the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea (Nguyen et al., 2020b). Plants from warm environments (i.e. Z. marina from southern populations and P. oceanica from shallow meadow stands) activate a more complete (i.e. higher number of up-regulated genes) and intense (i.e. stronger activation of heat-responsive genes) transcriptomic response than plants from cold environments (Z. marina from northern populations, P. oceanica from deep-water populations) (Franssen et al., 2014;Marín-Guirao et al., 2017). Plants with a 'warmer thermal history' also showed higher constitutive levels of heat-responsive genes, likely reflecting their local (pre-)adaptation to warmer and more stressful thermal conditions. Higher constitutive expression levels of heat-responsive genes have been associated with a pre-adaptive defence strategy that confers higher thermal tolerance to cope with frequent heat stress in several marine organisms, including corals and marine gastropods (Barshis et al., 2013;Gleason &amp; Burton, 2015). While plants from southern and northern European populations of Z. marina reacted similarly to acute heat stress (Franssen et al., 2011), they differed in their global transcriptome recovery after the temperature returned to 'normal'. This phenomenon is known as transcriptomic resilience and may be part of a more universal indicator of whether or not plants can endure critical temperatures or other stressor levels.(d) Intraspecific differences in molecular responses to warming amongst seagrass populations from different thermal origins Seagrass populations from different thermal origins respond differently to warming.

        <p>Studies regarding epigenetic modifications are now emerging in the field of seagrass molecular biology (Jueterbock et al., 2020;Nguyen et al., 2020a). Epigenetic modifications are molecular modifications that alter gene expression in response to internal (e.g. ontogenetic processes) or external (e.g. environmental changes) triggers, without changes in the underlying DNA sequence (Bossdorf, Richards &amp; Pigliucci, 2008). Epigenetic modifications are inherited through mitosis in most cases, but are also transmittable to the next generation. While epigenetic modifications have been widely studied in terrestrial plants (Chinnusamy &amp; Zhu, 2009;Kinoshita &amp; Seki, 2014;Liu et al., 2015), only a few studies have investigated epigenetic responses to warming in seagrasses (Ruocco et al., 2019a,b;Jueterbock et al., 2020;Nguyen et al., 2020a; L. Entrambasaguas, M. Ruocco, K.J.F. Verhoeven, G. Procaccini &amp; L. Marín-Guirao, in preparation). Some transcriptomic data sets suggest the involvement of epigenetic modification in the responses of seagrasses to thermal stress (Marín-Guirao et al., 2017;Marín-Guirao et al., 2019;Jueterbock et al., 2020). For example, in P. oceanica, heat-tolerant plants showed higher expression of epigenetic-related genes (Marín-Guirao et al., 2017, 2019). Stress-induced epigenetic mechanisms are crucial in the activation of the immediate stress response and favour both short-and long-term adaptation, due to their important role in regulating the expression of stress-related genes (Liu et al., 2015). Increased knowledge on the epigenetic responses of plants to environmental changes in terrestrial systems (Molinier et al., 2006;Feng &amp; Jacobsen, 2011;Kinoshita &amp; Seki, 2014;Wang et al., 2016), and the possible application of more advanced molecular technologies (Kurdyukov &amp; Bullock, 2016;Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2018) may stimulate further study of epigenetic modification in seagrasses.Studies regarding epigenetic modifications are now emerging in the field of seagrass molecular biology (Jueterbock et al., 2020;Nguyen et al., 2020a).

        <p>(2) Effects of warming and seagrass responses at the physiological/biochemical level Biochemical and physiological response to thermal stress in seagrasses have been studied extensively since the 1990s (Fig. 1C), with earlier studies summarized in previous reviews (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a;Koch et al., 2013). Thermal stress tends to inhibit photosynthetic activity while simultaneously enhancing respiration. Recent findings suggest that extreme temperature changes could cause the degradation of chlorophyll as well as affecting the fluidity of the cellular membrane, among other impacts. In response to thermal stress, seagrasses tend to activate protective mechanisms such as the accumulation of photo-protective pigments and modification of fatty acid contents (see Fig. 2).(2) Effects of warming and seagrass responses at the physiological/biochemical level Biochemical and physiological response to thermal stress in seagrasses have been studied extensively since the 1990s (Fig. 1C), with earlier studies summarized in previous reviews (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a;Koch et al., 2013).

        <p>Warming affects seagrass physiological and metabolic processes including photosynthesis and respiration (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a). Under mild temperature increments, photosynthetic rate increases, likely due to an increase in membrane fluidity that improves the mobility of photosynthetic proteins embedded within the thylakoid membrane (e.g. the plastoquinone pool). Other factors, such as temperature-enhanced enzyme activity, may also play a role. Further temperature increases, however, reduce photosynthetic rate due to factors such as the detachment of functional proteins from the thylakoid membrane (e.g. PSII antenna, oxygen-evolving complex) and the inactivation of Rubisco (Sharkey, 2005;Allakhverdiev et al., 2008).Warming affects seagrass physiological and metabolic processes including photosynthesis and respiration (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a).

        <p>The optimal temperature for photosynthesis differs between tropical (27-33 C) and temperate (21-32 C) seagrasses (Lee et al., 2007a). Beyond this optimal window, warming negatively alters the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus. The reaction centre of photosystem II (PSII) is one of the most thermally sensitive components together with processes driving the electron transport chain, stromal enzymes, PSI activity, and chloroplast envelopes. Damage to PSII due to thermal stress can cause a reduction of effective quantum yield and maximum quantum yield, due to a significant increase in minimum fluorescence level (F 0 ) (Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2017, 2018;Nguyen et al., 2020a,b). In terrestrial plants, an increase in F 0 is one of the clearest indications of PSII inactivation due to thermal stress (Allakhverdiev et al., 2008). The key enzymes of the carbon fixation cycle (Rubisco and Rubisco activase) are also highly sensitive to heat stress, as a secondary consequence of disruptions in the thylakoid membrane (Salvucci &amp; Crafts-Brandner, 2004), thereby disturbing carbon fixation (Marín-Guirao et al., 2016). Extreme thermal stress can result in degradation of photosynthetic pigments (Chl a and Chl b) together with the accumulation of chlorophyll degradation products (pheophytin a and pheophytin b), further reducing photosynthetic capacity (Repolho et al., 2017;Beca-Carretero et al., 2018b;Nguyen et al., 2020a,b).

        <p>Together with impacts on photosynthesis, warming enhances respiration rates in seagrasses resulting in a carbon imbalance (Lee et al., 2007a;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2018;Yaping et al., 2019). In most cases, the respiration rate of the above-ground part of the plant is higher in comparison to the below-ground parts (Collier et al., 2017). The increase in above-to below-ground biomass ratio during thermal stress seen in many seagrass species may represent a defensive mechanism to lower the impact of thermal-induced elevated respiration (Collier, Uthicke &amp; Waycott, 2011;Olsen et al., 2012;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018).Together with impacts on photosynthesis, warming enhances respiration rates in seagrasses resulting in a carbon imbalance (Lee et al., 2007a;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2018;Yaping et al., 2019).

        <p>Modification of cell membrane fluidity is a common response of plants under stressful conditions including thermal stress. When exposed to increased temperatures, the viscosity of the lipid bilayer of cell membranes changes, leading to increased membrane fluidity, which can potentially affect the function of molecules embedded in or attached to the membrane (e.g. the water-splitting complex bonded to the thylakoid membrane). The ability to adjust the fatty acid content and composition of cell membranes plays a central role in the modification of membrane fluidity to cope with temperature changes. An increase in saturated fatty acid content makes the membrane less fluid and more stable under increased temperatures (Gaur &amp; Sharma, 2014). Seagrasses can increase the amount of saturated fatty acid and decrease the number of unsaturated fatty acids, thus maintaining membrane fluidity in response to thermal stress (Beca-Carretero et al., 2018a).

(2018a) showed that (i) seagrasses from a warm climate (southwest Mediterranean) were able to adjust their lipid components rapidly in response to rising temperatures compared with their counterparts from the colder northwest Mediterranean, and (ii) the fast-growing C. nodosa had a greater capacity to manipulate its lipid components compared with the slow-growing P. oceanica. Furthermore, modification of lipid content, ultrastructure, and microtubule organization all play an important role in stabilizing cell membrane fluidity under thermal stress conditions (Koutalianou, Orfanidis &amp; Katsaros, 2016).Modification of cell membrane fluidity is a common response of plants under stressful conditions including thermal stress. When exposed to increased temperatures, the viscosity of the lipid bilayer of cell membranes changes, leading to increased membrane fluidity, which can potentially affect the function of molecules embedded in or attached to the membrane (e.g. the water-splitting complex bonded to the thylakoid membrane). The ability to adjust the fatty acid content and composition of cell membranes plays a central role in the modification of membrane fluidity to cope with temperature changes. An increase in saturated fatty acid content makes the membrane less fluid and more stable under increased temperatures (Gaur &amp; Sharma, 2014). Seagrasses can increase the amount of saturated fatty acid and decrease the number of unsaturated fatty acids, thus maintaining membrane fluidity in response to thermal stress (Beca-Carretero et al., 2018a).

        <p>In thermal stress conditions, most terrestrial plants increase the storage of soluble and insoluble (starch) sugars to maintain a stable energy supply, membrane function, and to reduce the impact of increased respiration rates (Guy et al., 2007). Similarly, both tropical (Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum; Koch et al., 2007) and temperate seagrasses (P. oceanica and C. nodosa; Marín-Guirao et al., 2018) significantly increased their sugar content in response to increased water temperature. Only the plants from warm regions were able to re-allocate additional carbohydrate content from leaves (higher respiration rate) to rhizomes (lower respiration rate). This mechanism reduces the negative impact of thermal-enhanced respiration, allowing the plants to survive better under elevated thermal stress (Marín-Guirao et al., 2018). A comparison of the results from Koch et al. (2007) and Marín-Guirao et al. (2018) show that the tropical seagrasses H. wrightii and T. testudinum were better able to manage respiration stress through manipulation of carbohydrate content compared with the temperate species C. nodosa and P. oceanica.In thermal stress conditions, most terrestrial plants increase the storage of soluble and insoluble (starch) sugars to maintain a stable energy supply, membrane function, and to reduce the impact of increased respiration rates (Guy et al., 2007).

        <p>(3) Effects of warming and seagrass responses at the morphological/population level(3) Effects of warming and seagrass responses at the morphological/population level</p>
        <p>Warming has a strong effect on seagrass growth rates (Collier et al., 2011;Olsen et al., 2012;Collier &amp; Waycott, 2014;Hammer et al., 2018;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2020a,b), leaf traits (York et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2020b), and leaf/shoot number (Mayot, Boudouresque &amp; Leriche, 2005;Nejrup &amp; Pedersen, 2008;Beca-Carretero et al., 2018b;Nguyen et al., 2020b). While modification of the above-ground part can result in a reduction of above-to below-ground biomass ratio (York et al., 2013;Collier et al., 2017;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018), warming can also increase the above-to below-ground biomass ratio in fastgrowing seagrass species (see Collier et al., 2011;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018), reducing the biomass of nonphotosynthetic (below-ground) tissues and increasing photosynthetic biomass to offset the negative impacts of heat stress-enhanced respiration (see also Fig. 2).Warming has a strong effect on seagrass growth rates (Collier et al., 2011;Olsen et al., 2012;Collier &amp; Waycott, 2014;Hammer et al., 2018;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018;Kim et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2020a,b), leaf traits (York et al., 2013;Nguyen et al., 2020b), and leaf/shoot number (Mayot, Boudouresque &amp; Leriche, 2005;Nejrup &amp; Pedersen, 2008;Beca-Carretero et al., 2018b;Nguyen et al., 2020b).

        <p>In response to ocean warming, seagrass meadows can acclimatize or adapt to environmental changes (i.e. acclimation/ adaptation: 1 à 2 in Fig. 3). Seagrass meadows that normally experience large fluctuations in environmental parameters such as temperature, light, etc. are more likely to be able to survive ocean warming (Massa et al., 2009;Collier et al., 2011;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018;Soissons et al., 2018). In addition, the resilience of seagrass meadows depends on the genetic diversity of the population (Williams, 2001;Hughes &amp; Stachowicz, 2004;Ehlers, Worm &amp; Reusch, 2008). There is some evidence of local adaptation both in adjacent and distant meadows, and therefore it is difficult to generalize the effects observed in specific populations (Jueterbock et al., 2016;Marín-Guirao et al., 2016, 2018).In response to ocean warming, seagrass meadows can acclimatize or adapt to environmental changes (i.e. acclimation/ adaptation: 1 à 2 in Fig. 3).

        <p>In monospecific populations, plant responses to warming can be delayed and can be genotype specific (Reynolds et al., 2016a). During this recovery phase, the genotypic diversity of natural populations determines their resilience to MHWs in term of both the immediate response and recovery (Reusch et al., 2005;Ehlers et al., 2008). In meadows composed of different species, co-occurring species can change in relative abundance due to different heat sensitivities (Richardson, Lefcheck &amp; Orth, 2018) or differ in their ability to recover and recolonize after the perturbation (Nowicki et al., 2017). These changes can affect the structure and function of seagrass ecosystems and their resilience. Ocean warming usually favours small-and medium-sized species at the expense of larger species, reduces meadows structure, and decreases function and resilience as seen in the case of the small seagrass H. stipulacea (Winters et al., 2020).In monospecific populations, plant responses to warming can be delayed and can be genotype specific (Reynolds et al., 2016a).

        <p>Warming can also alter flowering in seagrasses, thus providing an escape mechanism through sexual reproduction and seed dispersal (escape in space and time: 1à3 in Fig. 3). Warming induces flowering in some species (Diaz-Almela, Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2007;Ruiz et al., 2018) and advances the onset of flowering in other cases (Blok, Olesen &amp; Krause-Jensen, 2018;Marín-Guirao et al., 2019). In the case of the clonal and long-lived P. oceanica, flowering has been linked to a heat stress response with potential adaptive consequences (Marín-Guirao et al., 2019). Through sexual reproduction, warming induces an increase in genetic diversity of seagrass populations, thus potentially sustaining the resilience of that seagrass meadow (Massa et al., 2009;Collier et al., 2011;Marín-Guirao et al., 2018;Soissons et al., 2018). Sexual reproduction provides seagrasses with an escape mechanism not only in space, but also in time. In some seagrass species, their seeds have a resting stage, which can last up to 2 years (e.g. Zostera, Halodule and Syringodium; reviewed by Orth et al., 2000). In other species, seagrass seeds can be dispersed over long distances by floating fruits (e.g. up to 55 km for for P. australis; Ruiz-Montoya et al., 2012) or by mega-herbivores like dugongs (Dugong dugon) and green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) which can help to spread seagrass seeds as far as 650 km away from the parental plants (Tol et al., 2017). These dormancy and dispersal mechanisms can potentially provide an avenue of escape for seagrasses from other environmental stressors.Warming can also alter flowering in seagrasses, thus providing an escape mechanism through sexual reproduction and seed dispersal (escape in space and time: 1à3 in Fig. 3).

        <p>In some cases, when the environmental temperatures are too extreme, they can be deleterious (i.e. die-off: 1 à 4 in Fig. 3). Massive die-offs of seagrasses due to ocean warming, especially after MHWs, have been reported recently (Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2010;Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018;Strydom et al., 2020). Increased mortality due to warming has been observed in adult plants and also in seedlings (Olsen et al., 2012;Guerrero-Meseguer, Marín &amp; Sanz-L azaro, 2017;Hern an et al., 2017;Pereda-Briones, Terrados &amp; Tomas, 2019). After such massive mortality, in some cases seagrass meadows can recover naturally, although such recovery can take decades, especially for slow-growing species (O'Brien et al., 2018). For example, after the acute MHW that affected the coastline of Western Australia in the austral summer of 2010/2011, recovery of the seagrass Amphibolis antarctica was still partial 5 years post-MHW (Strydom et al., 2020) while no seed production was recorded in the disturbed P. australis meadow until 2016-2017 (Kendrick et al., 2019). Recurrent MHWs can further increase plant mortality in already impacted populations, hampering their recovery and jeopardizing their survival (Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2010).In some cases, when the environmental temperatures are too extreme, they can be deleterious (i.e. die-off: 1 à 4 in Fig. 3).

        <p>After a local extinction, the same seagrass population can potentially recolonize its former space by asexual reproduction (i.e. vegetative recruitment) of acclimatized/adapted plants, and/or by sexual reproduction through seed dispersal and seed dormancy (i.e. re-colonization: 4à2 in Fig. 3) (Diaz-Almela et al., 2007;Blok et al., 2018;Ruiz et al., 2018;Marín-Guirao et al., 2019). This phenomenon has been documented following physical disturbance (Olesen et al., 2004), warm-induced anoxia events (Plus, Deslous-Paoli &amp; Dagault, 2003), or microalgal blooms (Lee et al., 2007b). Importantly, while relatively slow-growing seagrasses [e.g. Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides (Olesen et al., 2004) and Z. marina (Plus et al., 2003;Lee et al., 2007b)] tend to recolonize through sexual reproduction, faster-growing seagrasses [e.g. Cymodocea rotundata and H. uninervis (Olesen et al., 2004)] tend to undergo vegetative recolonization. Small-and medium-sized species often grow rapidly and can quickly re-occupy an area after heat stress.After a local extinction, the same seagrass population can potentially recolonize its former space by asexual reproduction (i.e. vegetative recruitment) of acclimatized/adapted plants, and/or by sexual reproduction through seed dispersal and seed dormancy (i.e. re-colonization: 4à2 in Fig. 3) (Diaz-Almela et al., 2007;Blok et al., 2018;Ruiz et al., 2018;Marín-Guirao et al., 2019).

        <p>On the other hand, the disappearance of local populations of seagrasses due to ocean warming can create an empty niche for colonization by new thermally tolerant species (new colonization: 4à5 in Fig. 3). The rapid expansion of the tropical seagrass H. stipulacea in the Mediterranean is an example of this phenomenon (Lipkin, 1975;Gambi, Barbieri &amp; Bianchi, 2009). Given that the invasive H. stipulacea has expanded rapidly throughout coastal areas of the Caribbean Sea within less than 20 years (Willette &amp; Ambrose, 2012;Steiner &amp; Willette, 2015), the distribution of this species in the Mediterranean has been predicted to accelerate in future (Georgiou et al., 2016;Beca-Carretero et al., 2020;Nguyen et al., 2020b). Optimistically, new colonizations by thermally tolerant species could provide alternative ecosystem services, including carbon sinks (even if less successfully; e.g. H. stipulacea, see Fig. 3) potentially counterbalancing service loss due to the extinction of the local temperate seagrasses (Apostolaki et al., 2019).On the other hand, the disappearance of local populations of seagrasses due to ocean warming can create an empty niche for colonization by new thermally tolerant species (new colonization: 4à5 in Fig. 3).

        <p>Finally, in an era of rapid ocean change, the future of seagrasses is, indeed, difficult to forecast (i.e. 2à4 &amp; 5à4 in Fig. 3). Although some thermal-adapted/thermal-tolerant seagrasses could potentially survive and even benefit from ocean warming in the near future (Saha et al., 2019;Nguyen et al., 2020b), the existence of these species/populations may be challenged due to the on-going increased frequency of extreme climatic events and human-induced impacts on the marine environment (Ralph et al., 2007;Oliver et al., 2019). However, seagrass management and restoration could effectively contribute to sustaining these seagrasses and their services into the future (Ramesh et al., 2019;Valdez et al., 2020). Will warm-adapted/thermal-tolerant seagrasses survive future ocean change? To the best of our knowledge, an answer to this question remains open.Finally, in an era of rapid ocean change, the future of seagrasses is, indeed, difficult to forecast (i.e. 2à4 &amp; 5à4 in Fig. 3).

        <p>(4) Effects of warming and seagrass responses at the ecosystem/planetary level Warming can switch seagrass ecosystems from autotrophic to heterotrophic (Burkholz, Duarte &amp; Garcias-Bonet, 2019) and enhance CO 2 together with methane fluxes from meadows into the atmosphere (Burkholz, Garcias-Bonet &amp; Duarte, 2020), not only reducing the ability of this ecosystem to buffer climate warming, but also contributing to it (see Fig. 3). After the massive mortality of seagrasses in Shark Bay (Australia), substantial quantities of CO 2 were released to the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect (Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018). A trophic transformation is not always the result of ocean warming, but will depend on seagrass species, co-occurring stressors (Macreadie &amp; Hardy, 2018), and sometimes the diversity of seagrass meadows (Burkholz et al., 2019). Warming threatens the distribution of large and long-lived species of seagrass [e.g. P. oceanica (Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2010;Jordà et al., 2012)], favouring the expansion of some small rapid-growing species [e.g. H. stipulacea (Georgiou et al., 2016;Nguyen et al., 2020b)]. Thus, warming is accelerating the tropicalization of temperate meadows (Hyndes et al., 2016). When the ecosystem functions of seagrasses depend strongly on their primary production (i.e. their biomass), a switch from large species to small species due to warming could significantly reduce their value in terms of ecosystem services as well as blue carbon storage (i.e. the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems).(4) Effects of warming and seagrass responses at the ecosystem/planetary level Warming can switch seagrass ecosystems from autotrophic to heterotrophic (Burkholz, Duarte &amp; Garcias-Bonet, 2019) and enhance CO 2 together with methane fluxes from meadows into the atmosphere (Burkholz, Garcias-Bonet &amp; Duarte, 2020), not only reducing the ability of this ecosystem to buffer climate warming, but also contributing to it (see Fig. 3).

        <p>Globally, seagrass meadows represent over 20% of nursery habitats for the 25 most important fishery species (Unsworth et al., 2019). Therefore, loss of seagrass meadows negatively impacts global fisheries, the economy, and coastal communities that rely on fishing for food and employment (Tuya, Haroun &amp; Espino, 2014;Unsworth et al., 2019).Globally, seagrass meadows represent over 20% of nursery habitats for the 25 most important fishery species (Unsworth et al., 2019).

        <p>Worldwide, seagrasses protect coastlines from the impact of waves and storms (Guannel et al., 2016). Nevertheless, it is important to note that the coastal defence service of seagrasses mostly depends on some large, long-lived species (e.g. Z. marina and P. oceanica). Warming threatens the existence of these species and enhances tropicalization with their replacement by small, seasonal species, which have a much lower capacity for coastal protection.Worldwide, seagrasses protect coastlines from the impact of waves and storms (Guannel et al., 2016).

        <p>Warming-induced seagrass declines can potentially alter neighbouring habitat-formers, such as corals (Bulleri et al., 2018). Where seagrasses grow alongside corals (e.g. Gulf of Aqaba, Israel; Winters et al., 2017), the disappearance of seagrasses has led to: (i) incremented sediment re-suspension and nutrients in the water column resulting in algal blooms (Genin, Lazar &amp; Brenner, 1995); (ii) enhanced decalcification of corals as a consequence of increased ocean acidification (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007); (iii) a reduction in biodiversity as some reef fish feed in nearby seagrass meadows (Beck et al., 2001); and (iv) increased prevalence of pathogens (Lamb et al., 2017). Warming, therefore, will not only affect seagrass habitats but also other nearby habitat-former species such as coral reefs.Warming-induced seagrass declines can potentially alter neighbouring habitat-formers, such as corals (Bulleri et al., 2018).

        <p>(5) Combined effects of warming and other stressors Under natural conditions, environmental stressors do not occur individually, but concurrently and synergistically (Sandifer &amp; Sutton-Grier, 2014). Hence, studying the interaction of ocean warming with other stressors is crucial for the comprehensive and precise understanding of seagrass responses to their changing environment (Gunderson, Armstrong &amp; Stillman, 2016).(5) Combined effects of warming and other stressors Under natural conditions, environmental stressors do not occur individually, but concurrently and synergistically (Sandifer &amp; Sutton-Grier, 2014).

        <p>Changes in salinity are recognized as a major factor forcing the evolutionary trajectory of seagrasses, conditioning their distribution, ecology, and biology (Kuo &amp; Den Hartog, 2000). It is among the most challenging factors for seagrasses to tolerate (Olsen et al., 2016), as is also the case for terrestrial plants. Global warming causes ice melting and sea-level rise, and an increase in watershed runoff, reducing salinity in some areas (Nicholls &amp; Cazenave, 2010), but warmer temperatures are also increasing salinity in semi-isolated oceans such as the Mediterranean Sea (Borghini et al., 2014). Increased salinity in seagrass habitats can also occur as a consequence of brine discharge into coastal waters from desalination plants (Touchette, 2007). Seawater desalination is a growing industry in several regions that are now experiencing water scarcity (Lattemann &amp; Höpner, 2008); brine discharge can have a negative impact on seagrass populations (Ruíz, Marín-Guirao &amp; Sandoval-Gil, 2009;Sandoval-Gil et al., 2014). Generally, seagrasses are tolerant to a range of salinities. Nonetheless, increased seagrass mortality in response to warming is greater at low salinity levels (i.e. below 15 PSU) (Nejrup &amp; Pedersen, 2008;Kaldy &amp; Shafer, 2013;Collier et al., 2014;Salo &amp; Pedersen, 2014). Thus, the combined effects of ocean warming and salinity changes (especially lower salinity levels) is a concern.Changes in salinity are recognized as a major factor forcing the evolutionary trajectory of seagrasses, conditioning their distribution, ecology, and biology (Kuo &amp; Den Hartog, 2000). It is among the most challenging factors for seagrasses to tolerate (Olsen et al., 2016), as is also the case for terrestrial plants.

        <p>The synergistic effects of salinity and temperature cannot be generalized among different species or populations. In fact, seagrass responses to stressors such as salinity changes depend on plasticity and local adaptation (Pazzaglia et al., 2021). Kaldy &amp; Shafer (2013) showed, for example, intraspecific differences between populations: northern Zostera japonica plants, which experienced a higher salinity range at Padilla Bay, were less resilient to heat stress than their counterparts growing at the southern limit of the species range (Coos Bay) that experienced a lower salinity range. Interspecific differences related to divergent responses to warming and salinity have been identified in the seagrass species Halophila ovalis, H. uninervis, and Z. muelleri (Collier et al., 2014). Moreover, the combined effects of temperature and salinity not only affects adult plants, but also induces mortality in seagrass seedlings, which can greatly influence the adaptation and resilience of seagrass meadows (Salo &amp; Pedersen, 2014).The synergistic effects of salinity and temperature cannot be generalized among different species or populations.

Changes in sedimentation regime, nutrient loading with subsequent algal blooms, and dredging all cause water turbidity (e.g. De Boer, 2007).

        <p>Seagrasses in an era of ocean warming are more prone to suffer from heat stress during MHWs. For example, the Australian species H. uninervis and Z. muelleri require saturating light levels to respond positively to increasing temperatures (Collier et al., 2011). This highlights the importance of maintaining and improving water quality to enhance the resilience of seagrass to climate warming. The interactive effects of light and temperature have been shown to be weaker than for each factor separately, and temperature seems to play a dominant role in this combination (York et al., 2013;Kim et al., 2019). For P. oceanica, Hendriks, Olesen &amp; Duarte (2017) identified the roles of light and temperature to be far more critical to seagrass health than CO 2 levels. In fact, the negative effects of ocean warming are forecast to outweigh any potentially positive effect of ocean acidification on some seagrass species (Zimmerman, Hill &amp; Gallegos, 2015;Repolho et al., 2017;Collier et al., 2018).Seagrasses in an era of ocean warming are more prone to suffer from heat stress during MHWs.

        <p>(c) Warming and sulphide stress Sulphate reduction is a fundamental process that occurs in terrestrial water-saturated soils as well as marine sediments, where gas exchanges are very limited, resulting in the natural accumulation of sediment sulphide (Holmer &amp; Hasler-Sheetal, 2014). Generally, sulphide is toxic to living organisms including seagrasses, as it can strongly impact cellular enzymatic processes (Raven &amp; Scrimgeour, 1997). To survive in the highly toxic sulphide environment of marine sediments, seagrasses have developed sophisticated mechanisms to transport oxygen from the leaves into the rhizosphere to maintain an aerobic environment, protecting their tissues from the intrusion of sulphide (Borum et al., 2007). Warming can accelerate microbial activities, in turn increasing sulphate reduction, and consequently, sulphide concentration in the sediments (Frederiksen et al., 2007;Marbà et al., 2007). This phenomenon, when accompanied by warming, can enhance sulphide intrusion into seagrass tissue with the potential further to disrupt carbon metabolism and result in plant starvation and mortality (Robblee et al., 1991;Koch et al., 2007;Holmer &amp; Hasler-Sheetal, 2014). There is evidence that warming can enhance sulphide stress in seagrasses (Garcias-Bonet et al., 2008;García et al., 2012García et al., , 2013)). Importantly, the sensitivity of seagrasses to the combined effects of warming and sulphide will be species specific (Koch et al., 2007) and depth specific (García et al., 2013). However, with on-going ocean warming, even deep seagrasses are likely to be negatively impacted by sulphide stress in the future (García et al., 2013).(c) Warming and sulphide stress Sulphate reduction is a fundamental process that occurs in terrestrial water-saturated soils as well as marine sediments, where gas exchanges are very limited, resulting in the natural accumulation of sediment sulphide (Holmer &amp; Hasler-Sheetal, 2014).

        <p>The rapid development of agricultural activities across the globe has released huge nutrient loads into rivers and coastal waters triggering eutrophication that leads to catastrophic consequences for sessile marine organisms (Rabalais, Harper &amp; Turner, 2001;Diaz &amp; Rosenberg, 2008;Rabalais et al., 2009). Nutrient enrichment also induces overgrowth of macroalgae, phytoplankton, and seagrass epiphytes, leading to light reduction and impacting seagrass growth and survival. Indeed, together with ocean warming, eutrophication is recognized as one of the main stressors to seagrasses globally [see reviews by Burkholder et al. (2007) and Lee et al. (2007a)]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the combined effect of warming and nutrient enrichment can vary. For instance, nutrient enrichment can accelerate the negative impact of warming on some seagrass species, such as Zostera capensis, C. nodosa and P. oceanica (Mvungi &amp; Pillay, 2019;Ontoria et al., 2019a,b). Pazzaglia et al. (2020) investigated the combined effects of warming and nutrient enrichment on different P. oceanica populations with different nutrient load histories. Plants growing in chronically eutrophic conditions were more prone to suffer from thermal stress than plants from populations living under oligotrophic/pristine conditions. Additionally, the accumulation of drift algae following an increase in seawater temperature and eutrophication may also affect seagrasses negatively. Drift algae are shallow-water unattached macroalgae that often bloom massively in eutrophication conditions and can deleteriously impact seagrass meadows (McGlathery, 2001). Holmer, Wirachwong &amp; Thomsen (2011) investigated the combined effects of drift algae and warming, showing that warming/ nutrient-induced higher densities of drifting algae can additively and synergistically extend the negative impacts of warming on the seagrass species H. ovalis and suggesting that drift algae should be removed to protect seagrass meadows. By contrast, Egea et al. (2018) showed that the combination of warming, nutrient enrichment, and acidification could have positive effects on the seagrass C. nodosa, and thus predicted that this species could benefit from future ocean change. Interestingly, warming and nutrient enrichment could also reduce grazing pressure on seagrasses, as in the case of the sea urchin Amblypneustes pallidus on the seagrass A. antarctica (Burnell et al., 2013).The rapid development of agricultural activities across the globe has released huge nutrient loads into rivers and coastal waters triggering eutrophication that leads to catastrophic consequences for sessile marine organisms (Rabalais, Harper &amp; Turner, 2001;Diaz &amp; Rosenberg, 2008;Rabalais et al., 2009).

        <p>The increase in coastal agriculture activities has led to the runoff of large quantities of agricultural herbicides (e.g. diuron, atrazine, hexazinone, tebuthiuron and ametryn) into coastal marine environments (Smith et al., 2012). These herbicides can have a strong impact on PSII of seagrasses, not only damaging seagrass performance but also increasing their susceptibility to other stressors (Flores et al., 2013;Negri et al., 2015;Wilkinson et al., 2015). To date, only one study has investigated the combined effects of warming and a herbicide (diuron), which showed strong antagonistic effects of combined stressors on the tropical seagrass species H. ovalis (Wilkinson et al., 2017).The increase in coastal agriculture activities has led to the runoff of large quantities of agricultural herbicides (e.g. diuron, atrazine, hexazinone, tebuthiuron and ametryn) into coastal marine environments (Smith et al., 2012).

        <p>(f) Warming and pathogens Massive losses of seagrass meadows have been documented across the globe after outbreaks of seagrass diseases (see review by Sullivan et al., 2018). Human-induced environmental changes, especially ocean warming, can enhance the susceptibility of seagrasses to these biotic threats by promoting the development of seagrass diseases and reducing their resilience (Sullivan et al., 2018;Burge &amp; Hershberger, 2020). 'Wasting disease', caused by the protist Labyrinthula sp., is the best studied example in seagrasses [e.g. Phytophthora gemini and Halophytophthora zostera (reviewed by Sullivan et al., 2018)]. There was a wasting disease epidemic in the seagrass Z. marina along the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe during the 1930s, causing the extinction of as much as 90% of the total Z. marina population, and leading to profound ecological impacts within the coastal ecosystem (Renn, 1936). Nevertheless, experimental studies have also shown that an increase in ocean temperature may limit infections of seagrass diseases. For example, recent studies on two Mediterranean seagrass species, P. oceanica and C. nodosa, suggested that temperatures above 28 C inhibit the growth of Labyrinthula sp., thus reducing the pathogenic pressure on this seagrass (Olsen et al., 2014;Olsen &amp; Duarte, 2015). In addition, Brakel et al. (2019) tested the effect of this protist on Z. marina in a predicted scenario with a combination of heat stress, light limitation, and different salinity levels, confirming the predicted reduction in pathogen pressure on seagrasses in response to predicted future warming. These results provide a more optimistic view about the future of seagrasses, particularly in the context of seagrass-pathogen dynamics. However, note that ocean warming may facilitate the presence and virulence of other marine diseases (both viruses and bacteria) (Burge &amp; Hershberger, 2020). Given that there remain few studies on this topic and that seagrass diseases remain virtually unexplored [see review by Sullivan et al. (2018) for examples of other diseases in seagrasses], we recommend that future studies should attempt to broaden our understanding of the relationship between warming and pathogens in seagrasses.(f) Warming and pathogens Massive losses of seagrass meadows have been documented across the globe after outbreaks of seagrass diseases (see review by Sullivan et al., 2018).

        <p>The plant-herbivore interaction is fundamental for both parties not only from an evolutionary point of view (Fritz &amp; Simms, 1992), but also from its role in sustaining ecosystem dynamics (Bakker et al., 2016). In the presence of ocean warming, increases in seawater temperature will affect seagrasses and their herbivores not only individually, but also interactively. In general, warming increases the metabolic rate of herbivores, consequently enhancing grazing pressure (Hillebrand et al., 2009). Nevertheless, studies on the interactions of seagrasses with herbivores in response to temperature changes revealed a complex situation (Burnell et al., 2013;Garthwin, Poore &amp; Vergés, 2014;Pagès et al., 2018;Guerrero-Meseguer, Marín &amp; Sanz-L azaro, 2020;Buñuel et al., 2021).

By contrast, Burnell et al. (2013) showed that a temperature increase could enhance grazing pressure of Amblypneustes pallidus on the seagrass A. antarctica; however, nutrient enrichment was shown to reduce grazing pressure in combination with ocean warming and acidification. Similarly, a recent study on P. oceanica and its main fish herbivore Sarpa salpa demonstrated that warming can make the seagrass more palatable, increasing the growth rate of the fish (especially in the larval stage), and thus potentially intensifying herbivory pressure (Buñuel et al., 2021). The combined effects of warming and herbivores also affect seagrass seedlings: Guerrero-Meseguer et al. (2020) found that the combined effects of MHWs and overgrazing led to a greater reduction in leaf growth and increased leaf senescence of P. oceanica seedlings in comparison with the effects of each factor alone. The authors suggested that the combined effects of ocean warming and other stressors are likely to threaten the survival of P. oceanica seedlings, and consequently sexual recruitment (Guerrero-Meseguer et al., 2020). By contrast, Garthwin et al.

        <p>Since warming potentially interacts with many other stress factors, seagrass meadows are currently under multiple anthropogenic pressures. Populations that are chronically stressed (e.g. under eutrophic conditions) might have a different tolerance or ability to respond to warming compared to healthy populations. There is an urgent need to explore how responses to warming differ between healthy and chronically stressed populations. This knowledge will be critical for improving the management and protection of valuable seagrass ecosystems by managing local factors that directly affect seagrass health, potentially enhancing their resilience to warming.Since warming potentially interacts with many other stress factors, seagrass meadows are currently under multiple anthropogenic pressures.

There is an urgent need to explore how responses to warming differ between healthy and chronically stressed populations. This knowledge will be critical for improving the management and protection of valuable seagrass ecosystems by managing local factors that directly affect seagrass health, potentially enhancing their resilience to warming.</p>
        <p>(2) Developing more precise and detailed seagrass distribution maps Some seagrass species are losing habitat at a rapid rate (Robblee et al., 1991;Seddon et al., 2000;Jordà et al., 2012;Marbà, Díaz-Almela &amp; Duarte, 2014) or are being replaced by the rapid expansion of other species (Gambi et al., 2009;Scheibling, Patriquin &amp; Filbee-Dexter, 2018;Nguyen et al., 2020b). Studies (Short et al., 2007;Jayathilake &amp; Costello, 2018) have provided general information regarding seagrass distribution, but there are many regions that remain unmapped (Assis et al., 2020;McKenzie et al., 2020). Building seagrass distribution maps can be challenging, especially for species that have a wide distribution range with different depths or inhabit mixed-species meadows. Effective methods have been developed to map seagrasses (see review by McKenzie, Finkbeiner &amp; Kirkman, 2001) and more recently, a low-cost field-survey method using snorkelling and S1. perpendicular transects (Winters et al., 2017) was developed at a small regional scale. Advanced technologies [e.g. satellite remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, camera-equipped drones] have also been employed in seagrass mapping research (Barrell et al., 2015;Phinn et al., 2018). Future work is encouraged both in developing advanced technologies and in building more detailed seagrass maps across different regions of the world.(2) Developing more precise and detailed seagrass distribution maps Some seagrass species are losing habitat at a rapid rate (Robblee et al., 1991;Seddon et al., 2000;Jordà et al., 2012;Marbà, Díaz-Almela &amp; Duarte, 2014) or are being replaced by the rapid expansion of other species (Gambi et al., 2009;Scheibling, Patriquin &amp; Filbee-Dexter, 2018;Nguyen et al., 2020b).

        <p>(3) Long-term monitoring programs Many countries across the globe have implemented seagrass long-term monitoring networks appropriate to their local species and habitats. Since the end of the 20th century, many monitoring programs have been aggregating data to create regional and/or global monitoring networks with the aim to preserve seagrass meadows and to increase scientific knowledge and public awareness about these threatened and valuable ecosystems. At the global level, Seagrass-Watch (http://www.seagrasswatch.org/) and SeagrassNet (http:// www.seagrassnet.org/) integrate hundreds of sites distributed along the coasts of dozens of countries for the long-term ecological monitoring of seagrasses. In the Mediterranean, the regional integration of existing networks is lacking, but initiatives are currently ongoing, for instance the POSIMED project (http://posimed.org/).(3) Long-term monitoring programs Many countries across the globe have implemented seagrass long-term monitoring networks appropriate to their local species and habitats.

        <p>Data from long-term seagrass monitoring programs are not only providing valuable information to unravel the status and trends of natural populations at the global, regional, and local scales (e.g. Thomas, Unsworth &amp; Rasheed, 2010;Rasheed &amp; Unsworth, 2011;de los Santos et al., 2019), but they are also helping in the development and execution of international environmental protection policies (e.g. the Marine Strategy European Directive). Seagrass monitoring programs are also recording environmental data, including water temperature, to correlate seagrass decline with warming trends or extreme warming events (Marbà &amp; Duarte, 2010;Richardson et al., 2018;Shields, Parrish &amp; Moore, 2019). However, ecosystem modelling and forecasting activities for seagrasses are still needed. This could be facilitated by bridging global and local observations, and by linking long-term data series from seagrass monitoring programs to the continuous recording of coastal environmental conditions. Currently, platforms and sensor systems to measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological properties are increasingly being installed in coastal areas and oceanic regions worldwide [e.g. GOOS (https://www.goosocean. org/) and OOI (https://oceanobservatories.org/)]. The production of high-throughput data from multidisciplinary studies is a promising advance towards improving all aspects of seagrass conservation, from dynamic model development to forecast validation. These are powerful holistic approaches to monitoring seagrass ecosystems and their evolution in a rapidly changing ocean, as well as to contribute to their effective conservation and to the management of human activities in coastal areas (Capotondi et al., 2019). The integration of time-series data through multivariate statistics and/or machine-learning algorithms could also provide promising tools to monitor coastal ecosystems in a changing climate (Danovaro et al., 2016;Crise et al., 2018).Data from long-term seagrass monitoring programs are not only providing valuable information to unravel the status and trends of natural populations at the global, regional, and local scales (e.g. Thomas, Unsworth &amp; Rasheed, 2010;Rasheed &amp; Unsworth, 2011;de los Santos et al., 2019), but they are also helping in the development and execution of international environmental protection policies (e.g. the Marine Strategy European Directive).

        <p>(4) More realistic experiments in controlled conditions Many past studies suffered from experimental constraints/ limitations such as using unrealistic temperature levels, warming rates, experimental duration, small water volumes, or even single seagrass shoots that prevented clonal integration (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a). By contrast, recent experiments have become more realistic due to the development of sophisticated mesocosm systems for the culture of seagrasses in optimal conditions, and their use to conduct finely tuned and highly controlled experiments (Bergmann et al., 2010;Marín-Guirao et al., 2011;Georgiou et al., 2016;Cambridge et al., 2017;Oscar, Barak &amp; Winters, 2018;Ruocco et al., 2019b). These new systems have enabled more robust experiments to obtain not only a significant amount of knowledge in a short period but also novel results (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a). In the near future, the application of more advanced technologies are expected to push the boundary of seagrass research even further by enabling in situ experiments (e.g. Egea et al., 2019) and near-natural simulated environment experiments (e.g. Saha et al., 2019).(4) More realistic experiments in controlled conditions Many past studies suffered from experimental constraints/ limitations such as using unrealistic temperature levels, warming rates, experimental duration, small water volumes, or even single seagrass shoots that prevented clonal integration (Bulthuis, 1987;Lee et al., 2007a).

        <p>There is now an increasing recognition of the fundamental interactions between symbiotic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and archaea) and their host organisms. From both an ecological and evolutionary point of view, we should perhaps consider the organisms and their symbiotic microorganisms not separately but together. The term 'holobiont' has been used to describe this combination of the host organism and its microbiome (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). In terrestrial plants, the number of studies considering the holobiont has increased, uncovering important functions of the microbiome in plant nutrition, resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and evolution (Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015). In marine environments, interactions across holobionts are expected to be more flexible, with faster microbial community shifts, and greater phylogenetic diversity compared to terrestrial ecosystems (Dittami et al., 2021). Compared with terrestrial plants, the importance of the holobionts in marine ecosystems is understudied. Some pivotal investigations of seagrassbacteria interactions have suggested many important roles in providing nutrients, sustaining fitness, enhancing growth, and protecting seagrasses from toxic compounds and pathogens [see reviews by Ugarelli et al. (2017), Tarquinio et al. (2019) and Conte et al. (2021)]. In the face of ocean warming, the activity of the seagrass-bacterial community in relation to carbon remineralization is expected to increase, consequently reducing carbon accumulation rates in seagrass meadows (Trevathan-Tackett et al., 2017).

        <p>(6) Seagrasses as a solution to mitigate climate change Adopting the concept of Gattuso et al. (2018) that ocean solutions may allow us to address climate change, it is essential to restore and conserve healthy seagrass meadows worldwide in order to preserve the ecosystem services that they provide in mitigating climate change and its associated effects. In the agriculture and food industries, the application of genetic engineering has significantly improved the productivity and quality of crops and commercial species (see review by Janni et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, such approaches [e.g. clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/ Cas9)] have never been applied in seagrass research. This novel approach provides a promising way to select, breed, or produce genotypes that can survive future harsh environmental conditions (i.e. assisted evolution; see also Bulleri et al., 2018). Such potential super-seagrasses could help us to re-establish ecosystems in areas where seagrasses have been completely destroyed due to natural and/or humaninduced catastrophic events. Additionally, as seagrasses growing in extreme environments (e.g. under anthropogenic pressures, frequent MHWs, etc.) are expected to be more resilient to ocean warming, transplantations performed using such selected plants could be extremely useful in seagrass restoration (see review by Tan et al., 2020). Moreover, emerging knowledge in the field of thermal stress memory and epigenetic memory in seagrasses (Jueterbock et al., 2020;Nguyen et al., 2020a) could yield in many potential applications in seagrass restoration. Together, the application of such new approaches could support attempts to restore degraded seagrass meadows effectively and sustainably at a global scale and consequently protect their ecosystem services (Reynolds et al., 2016b), thus ultimately mitigating the negative impacts of climate change.(6) Seagrasses as a solution to mitigate climate change Adopting the concept of Gattuso et al.
