        <p>Soils contain more carbon than the atmosphere and vegetation, combined. Increased flow of carbon from the atmosphere into soil pools could help mitigate anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and climate change. Yet we do not know how quickly soils might respond because the age distribution of soil carbon is uncertain. Here we use 789 radiocarbon (∆ 14 C) profiles, along with other geospatial information, to create globally-gridded datasets of mineral soil ∆ 14 C and mean age. We find that soil depth is a primary driver of ∆ 14 C, whereas climate (e.g. mean annual temperature) is a major control on the spatial pattern of ∆ 14 C in surface soil. Integrated to a depth of 1-meter, global soil carbon has a mean age of 4830±1730 years, with older carbon in deeper layers and permafrost regions. In contrast, vertically-resolved land models simulate ∆ 14 C values that imply younger carbon ages and more rapid carbon turnover. Our data-derived estimates of older mean soil carbon age suggest that soils will accumulate less carbon than predicted by current Earth system models over the 21 st century. Reconciling these models with the global distribution of soil radiocarbon will require better representation of the mechanisms controlling carbon persistence in soils.Soils contain more carbon than the atmosphere and vegetation, combined.

        <p>To be useful for CO2 emissions mitigation, soil carbon pools must react to increased carbon inputs on decadal to centennial timescales. Assuming first-order loss rates remain constant, increases in carbon inputs eventually lead to a proportional increase in carbon stock. To a first approximation, older carbon pools, with mean ages of thousands to tens of thousands of years, have substrate inputs and outputs that are small compared to the total amount of carbon stored in the pool 5 . With these pools, it can take thousands of years for carbon to accumulate. In contrast, young carbon pools with mean ages of decades to a few centuries can accumulate new carbon more quickly. While these pools could sequester carbon on timescales relevant for climate mitigation, their smaller sizes and higher rates of carbon turnover may limit carbon storage capacity.To be useful for CO2 emissions mitigation, soil carbon pools must react to increased carbon inputs on decadal to centennial timescales.

        <p>Leveraging these principles, we analyzed 789 vertical soil profiles from the International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD) 12 . This approach builds on an analysis by He et al. 13 in which earth system models constrained by soil radiocarbon predicted less carbon uptake in response to rising atmospheric CO2. Their analysis raised questions about the environmental drivers of soil radiocarbon and how those drivers are represented in earth system models. To address these questions, we leveraged the new ISRaD database to generate the first global, spatially-and depth-resolved data product for soil radiocarbon. We used the data product to calculate the mean age distribution of global soil carbon, analyze the environmental drivers of biome-level variability in soil radiocarbon, and test predictions from state-of-the-art earth system models.Leveraging these principles, we analyzed 789 vertical soil profiles from the International Soil Radiocarbon Database (ISRaD) 12 .

        <p>We express soil radiocarbon as ∆ 14 C, the difference in 14 C/ 12 C ratio between the sample and an absolute standard expressed in parts per thousand 14 . Positive ∆ 14 C indicates the presence of bomb carbon, whereas negative ∆ 14 C indicates that radioactive decay of 14 C overwhelms any incorporation of bomb carbon into the sample. Radiocarbon measurements covered all major land biomes (Supplementary Fig. 1a) with a wide range of mean annual temperature and precipitation (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Most of the soil profiles reported in ISRaD were sampled in the first 100 cm during 1990-2010, and 75% of the profiles included more than one vertical horizon (Supplementary Fig. 2).We express soil radiocarbon as ∆ 14 C, the difference in 14 C/ 12 C ratio between the sample and an absolute standard expressed in parts per thousand 14 .

        <p>Because soil sampling date affects ∆ 14 C, we used a one-pool model to normalize all the ∆ 14 C measurements to the year 2000, around which most of the data were collected (Supplementary Fig. 2a), before conducting the statistical analysis (see Methods). A random forest model showed that depth was the primary control on soil ∆ 14 C, followed by mean annual temperature and precipitation (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Soil ∆ 14 C decreased with greater soil depth and increased with greater mean annual temperature and precipitation (Supplementary Fig. 4). Mechanisms driving the decline in ∆ 14 C with depth could be changes in microbial activity, smaller carbon substrate inputs from plants, and increased carbon stabilization by mineral sorption 15,16 . Soil depth and clay content may be important proxies for physical protection as suggested in previous studies 17 . However, the minor role of clay content in our analysis suggests that other depthdependent variables such as the type of clay, cation exchange capacity 18 , and mineral chemistry 19,20 may be more important determinants of soil ∆ 14 C. Further investigation into these mechanisms would advance our predictive understanding of soil carbon dynamics.Because soil sampling date affects ∆ 14 C, we used a one-pool model to normalize all the ∆ 14 C measurements to the year 2000, around which most of the data were collected (Supplementary Fig. 2a), before conducting the statistical analysis (see Methods).

        <p>For surface soils (0 -30 cm), mean annual temperature was a dominant control on the spatial variation of ∆ 14 C (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Mechanistically, warmer temperatures may allow for a longer growing season, higher levels of net primary production, greater soil carbon inflows, and more rapid decomposition of labile carbon pools that are not closely bound to mineral surfaces. The importance of this variable is consistent with previous work showing that climate regulates the global spatial pattern of turnover times for ecosystem carbon 21 and soil carbon 22 .For surface soils (0 -30 cm), mean annual temperature was a dominant control on the spatial variation of ∆ 14 C (Supplementary Fig. 3b).

        <p>Based on the relationships with environmental drivers in our random forest model, we scaled up ∆ 14 C measurements from individual soil profiles to create global maps (Methods). Soils had less negative (or more positive) values of carbon-weighted ∆ 14 C in tropical regions than in temperate and boreal regions (Fig. 1, a to c; Supplementary Fig. 5). Carbon in subsurface soils consistently had more negative ∆ 14 C than carbon in surface soils (Fig. 1, b andc). Most surface soils in the tropics had a ∆ 14 C greater than 0‰ (Fig. 1b), whereas all subsurface soils had negative ∆ 14 C values (Fig. 1c). The carbon-weighted ∆ 14 C was -244±48‰ globally, with values of -97±24‰ in surface soil and -391±56‰ in subsurface soil (Table 1).Based on the relationships with environmental drivers in our random forest model, we scaled up ∆ 14 C measurements from individual soil profiles to create global maps (Methods).

        <p>Mean annual temperature structured the spatial variation of ∆ 14 C in our global maps, with a sharp increase near -4°C and then further, more gradual increases between 0 and 25°C (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Among different biomes, tundra had the most negative ∆ 14 C, with median values of -249‰ and -624‰, respectively, for surface and subsurface soils. Tropical forests had the greatest ∆ 14 C in surface soils with a median value of 7‰, and intermediate values in subsurface soils, with a median of -250‰. Permafrost soils had considerably more negative ∆ 14 C than nonpermafrost soils (Table 1). In addition to temperature, mean annual precipitation also influenced ∆ 14 C at a regional scale. For example, drier grasslands and shrublands, and wetter boreal and temperate forests had more negative ∆ 14 C (Supplementary Fig. 6b).Mean annual temperature structured the spatial variation of ∆ 14 C in our global maps, with a sharp increase near -4°C and then further, more gradual increases between 0 and 25°C (Supplementary Fig. 6a).

        <p>The depth profiles of soil ∆ 14 C also differed among biomes (Supplementary Fig. 7). Tundra and boreal forest ecosystems had much stronger depletion of radiocarbon in deeper soil layers where sub-zero temperatures and permafrost processes regulate carbon cycling 23 . In deep tropical forest soils, the random forest model was not able to fully capture low observed ∆ 14 C values-which occur despite warm temperatures-suggesting that more detailed information about vertical transport and mineral stabilization mechanisms is needed in future modeling efforts.The depth profiles of soil ∆ 14 C also differed among biomes (Supplementary Fig. 7).

        <p>To convert ∆ 14 C into mean soil carbon age, we fit a one-pool carbon model to the ∆ 14 C estimate in each grid cell and depth interval using the time series of atmospheric ∆ 14 C over the past 50 ky 24 (Methods). Globally, the carbon-weighted mean age of mineral soil carbon was 4830±1730 (mean ± standard deviation) years between 0 and 100 cm depth (Table 1). Surface soils (0 -30 cm) had a younger mean age (1390±310 years) than subsurface soils (8280±2820 years; 30 -100 cm). Use of a two-pool model to estimate mean age yielded similar but slightly older estimates (Supplementary Fig. 8). Mean age varied as a function of latitude (Fig. 1, d to f and Supplementary Fig. 9), mean annual temperature (Supplementary Fig. 10a) and among biomes (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 10b). Our estimated age distribution for soil carbon in tropical forests was comparable to another independent estimate derived from 13 C 25 . In permafrost regions, soil carbon ages were considerably older than in other regions, ranging from about 2800 years for the surface layer to over 15,000 years for the subsurface layer (Table 1, Fig. 1, e andf, and Fig. 2). To a depth of 100 cm, about 24% (450 Pg out of 1848 Pg) of global soil carbon was younger than 1000 years (Fig. 2), with nearly all of this carbon confined to the 0 -30 cm surface layer (Figs. 1e and2). In contrast, nearly all subsurface soil carbon (1005 Pg out of 1008 Pg) was older than 1000 years (Figs. 1F and2), meaning that it is probably unresponsive to changes in carbon inputs from 21 st century global environmental change.To convert ∆ 14 C into mean soil carbon age, we fit a one-pool carbon model to the ∆ 14 C estimate in each grid cell and depth interval using the time series of atmospheric ∆ 14 C over the past 50 ky 24 (Methods).

        <p>The global three-dimensional structure of soil ∆ 14 C provides a new way to constrain land surface models that resolve soil carbon vertically. We compared our gridded ∆ 14 C dataset with two stateof-the-art global land models, version 5 of the Community Land Model (CLM5) 26 and version 1.0 of the land model within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (ELM v1.0) 27 . Compared to the gridded dataset, the land surface models overestimated ∆ 14 C in both surface and subsurface soil layers (Fig. 3, and Supplementary Figs. 111213), and in each biome (Supplementary Tables 12). In surface soils, over 60% of carbon in each of the models had positive ∆ 14 C values compared to only about 14% of carbon in the global gridded dataset (Fig. 3, a, c ande). The two models also predicted that about 50% of subsurface soil carbon had ∆ 14 C more positive than -200‰ (Fig. 3, d andf), whereas this amount was less than 10% in the dataderived product (Fig. 3b). The over-estimation in the two models occurred in all biomes, with larger positive biases in tropical biomes and smaller positive biases in boreal forest and tundra biomes.The global three-dimensional structure of soil ∆ 14 C provides a new way to constrain land surface models that resolve soil carbon vertically.

        <p>The over-estimation of ∆ 14 C in the two models is likely a consequence of positive biases in fresh carbon inflows at depth, vertical substrate diffusion 28 , and carbon turnover in slow and passive carbon pools 13 . The two models employ a similar decomposition cascade whereby plant litter passes through pools with successively longer turnover times. Moreover, aboveground litterfall is distributed throughout the soil column following rooting depth profiles for each plant functional type 29 , and this parameterization may provide a larger than expected input of modern soil carbon to deeper soil horizons.The over-estimation of ∆ 14 C in the two models is likely a consequence of positive biases in fresh carbon inflows at depth, vertical substrate diffusion 28 , and carbon turnover in slow and passive carbon pools 13 .

        <p>Differences in other model parameters result in distinct spatial distributions of soil carbon stocks and ages. Specifically, ELM uses a smaller value for zt, the e-folding depth that reduces the intrinsic decomposition rate for soil carbon in deeper soil horizons 29 , whereas CLM5 has higher zt, but applies stronger soil moisture limitations on decomposition 26,30 . Globally, the ELM parameterization provides more negative ∆ 14 C values, especially in deeper soils (Supplementary Figs. 11,13; and Tables 12), albeit not for mechanistically satisfying reasons. To match the 14 C observations, our analysis suggests the models should retain a smaller fraction of fresh litter inputs in soil carbon pools with long turnover times. Also, the turnover times of these 'slow' or 'passive' pools that comprise the majority of soil carbon should be much greater. In developing improved models, however, a mechanistic representation of carbon cycling is needed that recognizes the potential vulnerability of key reservoirs, including carbon stored in permafrost soils 8,23 .Differences in other model parameters result in distinct spatial distributions of soil carbon stocks and ages.

        <p>Although soil carbon is heterogeneous, consisting of multiple fast-and slow-cycling pools, our ∆ 14 C data provide a key constraint on the slow pools that make up the bulk of soil organic carbon. Previous estimates of turnover based on the ratio of carbon stocks to inputs 22,30 imply faster cycling and younger ages of soil carbon compared to our results. The discrepancy arises because most net primary production cycles through relatively small soil carbon pools on timescales of years to decades. Such a "leaky" response to increased carbon input is also supported by empirical studies [5][6][7] . The bulk of soil carbon, in contrast, is supplied by a very slow trickle of inputs that are stabilized on millennial timescales. However, CLM5 and ELM both assume that a larger fraction of recent photosynthate is retained in the soil system as indicated by their positive biases in ∆ 14 C (Fig. 3). Due to these biases, the global models may be too responsive to new carbon inputs and may over-estimate the effect of CO2 fertilization on productivity and potential soil carbon sequestration 13 . The millennium-scale mean age of global soil carbon, coupled with limited retention of bomb carbon over the past 70 years, implies that soil carbon is unlikely to increase as much as predicted in land surface models with CO2 fertilization over the next few decades. Nevertheless, the depth-resolved models are better at predicting soil carbon age compared to models that omit soil depth 31 , and a clear path now exists for improving these models using observations from ISRaD 12 .Although soil carbon is heterogeneous, consisting of multiple fast-and slow-cycling pools, our ∆ 14 C data provide a key constraint on the slow pools that make up the bulk of soil organic carbon.

        <p>Despite its old age, soil carbon in many ecosystems may still be vulnerable to climate and land use change. For example, permafrost thaw in tundra and boreal forest may allow for the rapid decomposition and release of previously protected deep soil carbon 8 . Similarly, disturbance associated with the expansion of global agriculture accelerates decomposition through the physical destruction of soil aggregates and by exposing deep soil carbon to microbial decay 9,32 .Despite its old age, soil carbon in many ecosystems may still be vulnerable to climate and land use change.

        <p>For more than 25 years, soil science has upheld a paradigm that mineral soil carbon mainly consists of pools with decadal and centennial turnover times. Despite a growing awareness of old soil carbon stabilized in deep soils, expert assessments and influential models such as Century have considered carbon with millennium turnover times to be a relatively small fraction of bulk soil organic matter 34,35 . Yet we show that in deeper soils, which represent more than half of the global soil carbon stock, pools with multi-millennium ages are dominant, yielding a global mean deep-soil age over 8000 years. Even in surface soils from 0-30 cm, our mean age estimate of over 1300 years suggests that millennial-scale carbon pools may equal or exceed centennial pools. Future work could further constrain the distribution of turnover times by combining data (such as respiration 36 ) that constrain faster C pools with bulk soil isotopic measurements 25 .For more than 25 years, soil science has upheld a paradigm that mineral soil carbon mainly consists of pools with decadal and centennial turnover times. Despite a growing awareness of old soil carbon stabilized in deep soils, expert assessments and influential models such as Century have considered carbon with millennium turnover times to be a relatively small fraction of bulk soil organic matter 34,35 .

        <p>Statistical modeling to identify key factors that influence vertical and spatial variability in soil ∆ 14 C was accomplished using machine learning techniques implemented in the Python 
            <rs type="software">environment for statistical computing</rs> (
            <rs type="software">Scikit-Learn</rs>). We used a suite of algorithms including three generalized linear models, support vector regression, and two bagging and boosting ensemble methods. For model fitting, we used all soil profiles with predictors including mean annual temperature and precipitation, land cover type, soil depth, soil order, and soil clay content. Land cover type and soil order are categorical variables and were converted to binary variables for each class. A 5-fold cross validation based on soil profiles showed that random forest performed the best, accounting for about 69% of the variation in the profile dataset (Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, we used the random forest algorithm for our main analysis.

        <p>The random forest algorithm used 300 decision trees, with the maximum depth of 18. The learned hyperparameter values were derived using the grid search cross validation method from the

        <p>Note that the data-derived global gridded ∆ 14 C is subject to uncertainties from the machine learning algorithm, errors in the predictors of climate, soil properties, and land cover type, as well as uncertainty in the soil carbon content for the weighted ∆ 14 C estimates. We quantified these main uncertainty sources at both grid scale (Supplementary Fig. 17) and biome levels (Supplementary Table 5). To estimate the uncertainty from the algorithm, we calculated the absolute differences in global-gridded ∆ 14 C in each regression tree and our gridded product (baseline); to estimate the uncertainty by each of the key drivers, we first computed global gridded ∆ 14 C by holding out the given driver, and then calculated the absolute difference between the ∆ 14 C predictions and the baseline estimate. We found that uncertainties caused by excluding temperature were always greater than those caused by excluding precipitation, followed by those caused by excluding soil clay content (Supplementary Fig. 17). These results are consistent with our analysis of relative importance of different variables (Supplementary Figure 3).Note that the data-derived global gridded ∆ 14 C is subject to uncertainties from the machine learning algorithm, errors in the predictors of climate, soil properties, and land cover type, as well as uncertainty in the soil carbon content for the weighted ∆ 14 C estimates.

        <p>Weighting ∆ 14 C by different soil carbon datasets created the largest uncertainty in our global estimates of ∆ 14 C, and including or excluding temperature and precipitation generated the largest uncertainty at a biome level. In addition, it is important to note that uneven sampling of soils in the ISRaD database, including relatively few sites in tundra and boreal forests, represents an important source of uncertainty and influences some of the breakpoints that emerge near -4°C in projections of ∆ 14 C and age shown in Supplementary Figs. 6 and 10. To reduce uncertainties in future work, more ∆ 14 C profile measurements are needed in high latitude ecosystems, peatlands, deserts, and along precipitation and temperature gradients in Africa and other sparsely sampled areas of the tropics (Supplementary Materials Fig. 1).

        <p>Interpretation of carbon dynamics from radiocarbon data requires the use of models. The most effective way to use ∆ 14 C as a constraint on carbon cycling is to directly simulate this tracer within a land surface model within each ecosystem pool and soil layer and compare these predicted values to radiocarbon measurements. This is the approach we take to evaluate carbon cycling within CLM5 and ELM1.0. However, we also used the ∆ 14 C dataset directly to estimate global three-dimensional structure of the mean age of soil carbon. This approach, while requiring simplifying assumptions, can help with building an intuitive understanding of the processes regulating soil carbon dynamics at a global scale.Interpretation of carbon dynamics from radiocarbon data requires the use of models.

        <p>We estimated mean age as the turnover time in a one-pool, homogeneous, steady state model that was fit to the ∆ 14 C value in each 1-cm soil layer. Specifically, we assumed a steady state of soil carbon and radiocarbon at the beginning of the model run (i.e., 50 ky BP) and ran the model until the year 2000 with the atmospheric history of ∆ 14 C. Then we determined the relationship between turnover time and ∆ 14 C in year 2000 (Supplementary Fig. 15). This relationship was used to derive the mean age for each layer. Note that when ∆ 14 C is greater than about 85‰, the calculation generates two mean turnover times (Supplementary Fig. 15a). We selected the longer one in our analysis, as measurements of bulk radiocarbon emphasize the carbon in mineralassociated organic matter that dominate total soil C content. In studies that applied multi-pool modeling to soil that had been divided into fractions according to density, the mineral-associated organic matter was associated with the longer turnover times [44][45][46] .We estimated mean age as the turnover time in a one-pool, homogeneous, steady state model that was fit to the ∆ 14 C value in each 1-cm soil layer.

        <p>This approximation of mean age is justified because the ∆ 14 C of the bulk soil carbon is primarily determined by pools of the most slowly cycling carbon. It is well known that soil carbon is not homogeneous, so our assumption of a single pool is simplistic but still informative. In theory, the mean age of material within a reservoir with multiple carbon residence times can be computed by using an impulse response approach 47 . The temporal integral of the product of the fractional mass remaining in the system with the time since entry of the impulse provides a direct measure of mean age. In practice this approach requires perfect knowledge of the different components that are cycling through the reservoir and their individual turnover times.

        <p>For each grid cell, we calculated carbon-weighted ∆ 14 C and mean age in the three depth intervals (0 -100 cm, 0 -30 cm, and 30 -100 cm) using soil carbon datasets from SoilGrids 37 and the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) 49 . Note that soil carbon content in SoilGrids has been updated (December 24 th , 2018) and is available at https://landgis.opengeohub.org.

The uncertainties associated with use of different algorithms or soil carbon datasets were lower when compared to those associated with inclusion or exclusion of temperature.
