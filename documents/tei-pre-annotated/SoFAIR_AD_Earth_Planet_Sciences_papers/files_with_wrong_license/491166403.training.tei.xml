        <p>The global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing 1-3 , offsetting roughly a third of anthropogenic CO2 released into the atmosphere each decade 1 , and thus serving to slow the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 4 . It has been suggested that a CO2-induced long-term increase in global photosynthesis, a process known as CO2 fertilization, is responsible for a large proportion of the current terrestrial carbon sink [4][5][6][7] . The estimated magnitude of the historic increase in photosynthesis as result of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies and terrestrial biosphere models [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] . Here, we quantify the historic effect of CO2 on global photosynthesis, by identifying an emergent constraint [14][15][16] that combines terrestrial biosphere models with global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2 fertilization increased global annual photosynthesis by 11.85±1.4%, or 13.98±1.63 Pg C (mean ± 95% confidence interval) between 1981 and 2020. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of the historic sensitivity of global photosynthesis to CO2, and highlight the large impact anthropogenic emissions have had on ecosystems worldwide.The global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing 1-3 , offsetting roughly a third of anthropogenic CO2 released into the atmosphere each decade 1 , and thus serving to slow the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 4 .

        <p>Globally, photosynthesis results in the single largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and the biosphere 17,18 . Long-term changes in photosynthesis, for example in response to rising atmospheric CO2, could therefore provide an important feedback to climate change 7 . Global photosynthesis cannot be observed directly, however, and must instead be either predicted by terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) or inferred from proxies 18 . The multiple longterm proxies from which changes in global photosynthesis are derived include satellite-based estimates 8,9 , ice-core records of carbonyl sulfide 13 , and herbarium samples of deuterium isotopomers 12 , along with information gleaned from the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 11 .Globally, photosynthesis results in the single largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and the biosphere 17,18 .

        <p>Despite the importance of photosynthesis, however, and the multiple proxies that exist, there is no consensus regarding the expected historic global change due to rising CO2 7-13 . Satellite-based estimates of global photosynthesis are derived from observations of surface reflectance, and are therefore often regarded as a benchmark to which TBMs should be compared 10 . Such comparisons suggest that TBMs overestimate the sensitivity of global photosynthesis to CO2 9,10 (but see ref. 19 ). However, satellite-TBM comparisons are mired by the fact that most satellite-based estimates do not incorporate the universally observed direct effect of increasing CO2 on the light use efficiency of leaves of C3 vegetation 20 , which is not observable from space 21 . In contrast, observation-based proxies, based on ice-core records of carbonyl sulfide (COS) 13,22 and herbarium and field-based deuterium isotopomers 12 , suggest that TBMs may underestimate the sensitivity of global photosynthesis to CO2.

        <p>We reconciled the apparent difference between the emergent constraint and satellite-based estimates of the sensitivity of GPP to CO2 (Fig. 2) by modifying the satellite-based estimates to account for the direct effect of increasing CO2 on C3 light use efficiency (LUE).

        <p>The closer agreement between the updated remote sensing approaches and the TBMs (Fig. 2) allows for their response to CO2 to be probed more deeply. The sensitivity of C3 photosynthesis to CO2 is a strong function of temperature 31 (Fig. 3a; Eq. 2-7), due to the fact that the suppression of oxygenation by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO) with increasing CO2 is greater at higher temperatures. Reduced RuBisCo oxygenation reduces photorespiration at high temperatures, as represented by the temperature dependence of the photosynthetic CO2 compensation point (Γ*, Eq. 3). The resulting latitudinal gradient is reproduced by both the TBMs examined (Fig. 3b) and the updated remote sensing approaches (Fig. 3c,d,e). The results suggest that the influence of CO2 on photosynthesis at high latitudes is limited due to low temperatures. Estimates of the long-term change in GPP from the updated remote sensing approaches show large changes particularly in areas of intensive agriculture such as the midwestern US corn belt, central and northern Europe, and India (Fig. 3c,d). Compared to the remote sensing approaches (Fig. 3d), the TBMs predict smaller increases in arid mid-and low-latitude regions, particularly in Australia and South Africa, but larger increases in tropical forests (Fig. 3d). The lower TBM sensitivity, in particular of shrublands (Fig. 3f), is potentially due to poorly represented TBM processes such as the positive relationship between CO2 and woody shrub expansion 32 . The relatively higher TBM sensitivity regions, particularly tropical forests (Extended Data Fig. 5), may be due to insufficient TBM representation of nutrient constraints 33 , or the saturation of remote sensing vegetation indices at high leaf area 34 , reflecting large uncertainty regarding the response of tropical forest photosynthesis to CO2 35 .The closer agreement between the updated remote sensing approaches and the TBMs (Fig. 2) allows for their response to CO2 to be probed more deeply.

        <p>A strong emergent relationship between the unknown and the observable (in this case photosynthesis and the recent land carbon sink) would not be apparent if ignored and varying model factors affect the relationship. It is important to highlight, however, as with any application of the emergent constraint technique, multiple factors could lead to biases and undermine the robustness of the derived constraint. Of primary concern is the potential for emergent constraints to rely on spurious cross-model correlations that are not based on a clear physical relationship 46 . The constraint we identify is based on the known relationship between CO2 and the land-sink 7 , and tests suggest it is temporally robust (Extended Data Fig. 4). An additional source of uncertainty relates to the degree of structural similarity between models and the potential for systematic cross-model biases. For example, if all models in the ensemble had the same missing or biased process representation, which led to systematic bias in the modeled relationship between the sensitivity of photosynthesis to CO2 and the land sink across models, that could bias the emergent constraint reported here. Systematic cross-model biases with shared structural similarity could also lead to an underestimation of the uncertainty associated with the values derived from the emergent constraint 46,47 . The models we examine represent the state-ofthe-science for land surface modeling, and have substantial diversity of process representations and responses to forcings 48 , even for well-studied processes such as photosynthesis. Our analysis is also designed to reduce the influence of structural diversity on the results through variance normalization. That said, future implementations of new process representations or model structures may lead to updated inference on the response of photosynthesis to CO2.A strong emergent relationship between the unknown and the observable (in this case photosynthesis and the recent land carbon sink) would not be apparent if ignored and varying model factors affect the relationship.

        <p>Global photosynthesis is the largest flux of carbon dioxide in the global carbon cycle, and small changes over time can lead to large changes in the net carbon sink.

The large differences between estimates of historic changes in GPP 8,9,11-13,22 is therefore disconcerting, and could potentially lead to incorrect inference regarding biases in current terrestrial biosphere models 9,21 , and long-term changes in related components of the global carbon cycle such as soil respiration 10, 50 .

        <p>Emergent constraints have gained prominence in recent years as a means by which to infer unobserved quantities of interest in land surface and climate models [14][15][16] . The underlying core concept is that although there is a large spread in the model estimates of an observed variable X and an unobserved variable Y across models, the relationship linking the two is sometimes tightly constrained across models. Given the existence of a strong and robust relationship across models between X and Y, observations of X can be used to generate a probabilistic inference, or constraint, on Y. This approach has been termed 'emergent' because the functional relationship cannot be diagnosed from a single model, but rather emerges from examining the model spread [14][15][16] .Emergent constraints have gained prominence in recent years as a means by which to infer unobserved quantities of interest in land surface and climate models [14][15][16] .

        <p>The emergent constraint identified in this study links the sensitivity of gross primary photosynthesis to CO2 (𝛽 ! .,, , see definition below) to the magnitude of the residual terrestrial sink (SLAND). It is derived from a multiple linear regression across an ensemble of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) between the modelled SLAND, the sensitivity of gross primary photosynthesis to CO2, the sensitivity of total ecosystem respiration (calculated as the sum of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration (Ra, Rh)) to CO2 (𝛽 ! -/01 ), and an interaction term between 𝛽 ! -/01 and the magnitude of the non-respired flux (γ).

        <p>Recent reports have highlighted that the most commonly used satellite-based estimates of GPP have a much lower CO2-sensitivity than that derived from TBMs 9,10 . However, most satellitebased estimates do not incorporate the universally observed direct effect of increasing CO2 on the light use efficiency of leaves of C3 vegetation 20 , which is not observable from space 21 . The effect of increasing CO2 on global C3 photosynthesis that we examine here manifests through two primary pathways: though increasing the biochemical rate of photosynthesis on a leaf area basis 53 , which we refer to as the direct effect, and through increases in leaf area on a ground area basis, allowing for the interception of greater amounts of light 54,55 , which we refer to as the indirect effect. The former, direct response, is due to the fact that CO2 is a substrate for the photosynthetic enzyme, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). Both CO2 and O2 compete at the active site of RuBisCO, so changes in the concentration of either affect the rate at which CO2 is assimilated, effectively changing the light use efficiency (LUE) of photosynthesis on a leaf area basis at a given light level. The latter, indirect response of increasing leaf area index (LAI 55 ) and the resulting increase in the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), reflects both the increased carbon available to invest in structural growth under elevated CO2, and potential changes in the hydrological equilibrium due to elevated CO2-induced increases in water use efficiency, which can lead to increased leaf area in water-limited ecosystems [56][57][58] . Both response pathways are incorporated in terrestrial biosphere models 3 , and long-term proxies account for each to differing degrees.

        <p>We assessed whether incorporating a CO2 sensitivity of LUE in remote sensing-based approaches for estimating GPP reconciled the difference between the sensitivity of remote sensing-based GPP to increasing CO2 and that implied by the emergent constraint. To do so, we develop a CO2 sensitivity function for incorporating the effect of increasing CO2 on the LUE of photosynthesis into satellite GPP estimates, based on the conservative assumption that the ecosystem-scale CO2 sensitivity is consistent with that of the electron-transport-limited rate of photosynthesis (Aj). This is supported by reports that the observed CO2 response of photosynthesis and biomass closely corresponds to the CO2-sensitivity of Aj 37 . In addition, it has been suggested that shaded, and thus primarily electron-transport limited, leaves contribute the majority of canopy 38,60 and global photosynthesis 41 . The assumption is further supported by optimal coordination theory, which posits that photosynthesis under typical daytime field conditions is close to the point where Rubisco-limited (Ac) and Aj are colimiting. The colimitation of Ac and Aj has been shown to hold across a range of ecosystems 61 , as has the downregulation of the maximum velocity of carboxylation (Vcmax) under elevated CO2 in order to maintain coordination 62 .

        <p>Early remote sensing GPP models 39,73 advocated for including a CO2 effect on LUE, though primarily used the larger, light-saturated, sensitivity. A recent review 8 found that the most widely used modern remote sensing GPP approaches 28,29 do not include a CO2 effect on LUE, and of the 3 that did (out of 14 assessed) two are enzyme kinetics, not LUE, models (BESS 74 , BEPS 75 ). The third (cFix 73 ) assumes the light-saturated CO2 sensitivity, which is not suitable for global application given the large contribution of RuBP regeneration limited leaves 38,76 . A recent study 77 incorporated a CO2 effect on LUE using the light-limited sensitivity, as we do here, but the approach taken requires the reparameterization of the LUE model and is thus not easily applicable to other remote sensing GPP products. The approach proposed here provides a generic and conservative method for incorporating CO2 effects on LUE in any remote sensing GPP product, which allows us to quantify the relative importance of incorporating a CO2 effect in remote sensing GPP products and reconciles the large difference between remote sensing and TBM-derived sensitivities to CO2. Note that although many remote sensing GPP products are calibrated to observations from eddy-covariance networks, our implementation does not require recalibration, in particular as it only affects the CO2 sensitivity, and eddy-covariance observations are not known to contain information on the effect of CO2 on photosynthesis (Extended Data Fig. 6).Early remote sensing GPP models 39,73 advocated for including a CO2 effect on LUE, though primarily used the larger, light-saturated, sensitivity.
