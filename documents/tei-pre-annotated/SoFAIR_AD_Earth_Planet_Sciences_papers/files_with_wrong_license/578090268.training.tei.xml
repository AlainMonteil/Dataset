        <p>In this paper, a joint transmit resource management and waveform selection (JTRMWS) strategy is put forward for target tracking in distributed phased array radar network. We establish the problem of joint transmit resource and waveform optimization as a dual-objective optimization model. The key idea of the proposed JTRMWS scheme is to utilize the optimization technique to collaboratively coordinate the transmit power, dwell time, waveform bandwidth, and pulse length of each radar node in order to improve the target tracking accuracy and low probability of intercept (LPI) performance of distributed phased array radar network, subject to the illumination resource budgets and waveform library limitation. The analytical expressions for the predicted Bayesian Cramér-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) and the probability of intercept are calculated and subsequently adopted as the metric functions to evaluate the target tracking accuracy and LPI performance, respectively. It is shown that the JTRMWS problem is a non-linear and non-convex optimization problem, where the above four adaptable parameters are all coupled in the objective functions and constraints. Combined with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, an efficient and fast threestage-based solution technique is developed to deal with the resulting problem. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed JTRMWS algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art benchmarks.In this paper, a joint transmit resource management and waveform selection (JTRMWS) strategy is put forward for target tracking in distributed phased array radar network.

Background and Literature Review I N recent years, the concept of transmit resource-aware management is of vital importance for target tracking application in distributed phased array radar network and has been extensively studied from various aspects to enhance resource usage efficiency, where there exists a contradiction between target tracking accuracy demand and illumination resource consumption in radar system [1]- [3].

        <p>In general, there are series of resource-aware management schemes for radar systems concentrating on achieving much better resource usage efficiency [4]- [6], which can be divided into two categories. The first one is designed to maximize the target tracking performance for certain system resource budgets. For instance, the authors in [7] investigate the problem of joint node selection and power allocation for multitarget tracking in decentralized radar networks, whose purpose is to minimize the worst-case tracking predicted conditional Cramér-Rao lower bound (PC-CRLB) with multiple targets. A two-step semi-definite programming-based solution approach is presented to solve the resulting problem. In [8], Sun et al. concentrate on the problem of joint power and bandwidth allocation for target tracking in clutter with an asynchronous radar network system, and the branch-reduce-and-bound technique is adopted to deal with the non-convex optimization model. It is validated that the target state estimation error can be efficiently decreased with the optimized illumination resource allocation. Later, the work of [9] extends the above study to netted colocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar case in order to achieve better target position estimation accuracy subject to certain system resource constraints. In [10], a joint subarray selection and power allocation scheme for multiple targets tracking employing large-scale MIMO radar networks is developed, which aims to enhance the overall target tracking performance by cooperatively adjusting transmitter selection, receiver selection, and power allocation. It is also illustrated that the relative geometry, target radar cross section (RCS), and weight coefficients affect the resource allocation results. In [11], a robust power allocation algorithm is proposed for resource-aware multi-target tracking in colocated MIMO radar, where a task utility function is defined and utilized to assess the target tracking accuracy for various power allocation strategies in a flexible behavior. The iterative parallel search technique is exploited to attain the solutions. More recently, in [12], a target capacity-based resource optimization algorithm in radar networks is proposed for target tracking application. The primary objective of the optimization model is maximize the number of targets that can be tracked with given accuracy requirements by coordinating the transmit power and dwell time of different radars. It is worth to point out that the value of false alarm rate has great impact on the target tracking performance in radar systems. However, in aforementioned resource-aware management studies, the false alarm rate selection and power allocation frameworks are separately discussed. Reference [13] puts forth a collaborative detection and power allocation strategy for target tracking in multiple radars configuration, which optimizes the false alarm rate and transmit power of each radar node under the constraints of some resource budgets.In general, there are series of resource-aware management schemes for radar systems concentrating on achieving much better resource usage efficiency [4]- [6], which can be divided into two categories.

        <p>On the basis of the aforementioned literature, the existing studies have made seminal contributions to the field of transmit resource scheduling in cognitive radar systems. Nevertheless, in some specific application backgrounds, those resource management strategies cannot be put into use straightway. Additionally, there are still some problems on resource-aware management in distributed radar network to be highlighted. Firstly, in theory, maximization of the target tracking accuracy and minimization of the illumination resource consumption are two conflicting goals, which are of importance and should be taken into consideration simultaneously. Secondly, although the transmit resources and waveform parameters have influence on the target tracking performance, they are separately discussed in previous strategies [2]- [13]. Practically, in order to achieve better target tracking performance, it is advantageous for us to integrate the resource-aware management and waveform selection schemes into a coherent framework. To this end, we need to establish appropriate evaluation mechanisms for target tracking performance and LPI performance respectively, formulate suitable objective functions in view of system resource constraints, and subsequently develop efficient and fast solution methodology to tackle the underlying optimization problem. Then, the distributed phased array radar network is capable of adjusting its resource allocation and waveform selection to track the target effectively. To realize this, a joint transmit resource management and waveform selection (JTRMWS) scheme is proposed for target tracking in distributed phased array radar network, with the aim of improving the target tracking accuracy and LPI performance at the same time while meeting several resource budgets and waveform library limitation. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such JTRMWS scheme for target tracking application in distributed phased array radar network until now.

In Stage (1), by employing appropriate relaxation reformulation and problem partition, the original optimization problem is equivalently recast as two sub-problems. In Stage (2), we strictly prove that the probability of intercept of each radar node is an upper convex function with respect to its dwell time, and the optimal value of dwell time can be obtained at the boundary. Then, the obtained dwell time results are utilized to calculate the transmit power of multiple radars.

        <p>In this section, several numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the JTRMWS scheme and analyze the impacts of various factors on the joint optimization results. The distributed phased array radar network with N = 4 spatially diverse radar nodes is considered, which aims at minimizing the target tracking error and the probability of intercept of radar network simultaneously employing its available illumination resource. The waveform library Ω consists of 25 waveform types with λ set = [1,3,5,7,9]µs and W set = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]MHz. The revisit interval between two successive instants is set to be ∆T = 1 s, and a series of M tot = 80 instants of measurements are exploited to support the numerical simulations. The lower and upper bounds for illumination power of each radar node are P min = 0 and P max = 14 kW, respectively. The corresponding bounds for dwell time of each node are fixed to be T min = 5 × 10 -4 s and T max = 2.5 × 10 -2 s, respectively. The dwell time is actually known as the coherent accumulation time, which has impact on the coherent accumulation SNR of radar system without affecting the pulse repetition interval. The initial position and velocity of the target are set to be [60, 80] km and [150, 260] m/s, respectively. The search time In the current work, in order to examine the effects of the relative geometry of the radar system with respect to the target, we consider two different simulated scenarios, which are illustrated in Fig. 2. Besides, to better analyze the influence of the target RCS on the joint optimization results, two target reflectivity models are investigated herein. In the first model, it is supposed that the target reflectivity is uniform and its RCS set to be σ t = 3m 2 . In the latter one, Fig. 3 depicts the target reflectivities with respect to different radar nodes, respectively. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the target RCS obeys normal distribution in the second reflectivity model, as shown in Fig. 3, whereas the proposed JTRMWS strategy is also applicable to different target RCS fluctuation models.In this section, several numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the JTRMWS scheme and analyze the impacts of various factors on the joint optimization results.

        <p>The transmit power and dwell time optimization results of the proposed JTRMWS scheme, obtained from a single Monte-Carlo simulation run, are respectively shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, and the corresponding waveform bandwidth and pulse length selection results are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively, which supports the evaluation of the JTRMWS scheme with the relative geometry of the distributed radar network with respect to the target and the target RCS factored out. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that either the minimum value of dwell time or its maximum value is designated to decrease the probability of intercept of each radar node, which is based on the target motion state in the tracking process and is consistent with the earlier derivations in ( 27)- (30). It is also worth to mention that the optimization results of the dwell time are varied from one radar to another, which is due to the fact that the multiple radar nodes illuminate the target from various aspect angles. The transmit power of each radar can be calculated according to Equation ( 28), as depicted in Fig. 4, and it is adaptively optimized to minimize the metric for LPI performance. Besides, according to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the waveform bandwidth and pulse length of each radar node are selected adaptively during the target tracking period. As previously stated, for each radar node, there exists a relationship between transmit waveform parameters, that is, waveform bandwidth and pulse length, and target tracking accuracy. Particularly, the pulse length is related to the range measurement accuracy, while the velocity measurement accuracy is influenced by both waveform bandwidth and pulse length, as shown in Equation (12). As such, combined with the obtained values of illumination power and dwell time, the waveform bandwidth and pulse length are chosen adaptively to optimize the target tracking performance by minimizing the objective function in Equation (18), which are the artifacts of the optimization process.The transmit power and dwell time optimization results of the proposed JTRMWS scheme, obtained from a single Monte-Carlo simulation run, are respectively shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, and the corresponding waveform bandwidth and pulse length selection results are illustrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 respectively, which supports the evaluation of the JTRMWS scheme with the relative geometry of the distributed radar network with respect to the target and the target RCS factored out.

        <p>Furthermore, in order to illustrate the superiorities of the proposed JTRMWS scheme in terms of target tracking accuracy and LPI performance, its averaged root mean square error (ARMSE) and the corresponding probability of intercept are compared with those of the following four benchmarks in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively, which is conducted over 150 Monte-Carlo trials:Furthermore, in order to illustrate the superiorities of the proposed JTRMWS scheme in terms of target tracking accuracy and LPI performance, its averaged root mean square error (ARMSE) and the corresponding probability of intercept are compared with those of the following four benchmarks in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 respectively, which is conducted over 150 Monte-Carlo trials:</p>
        <p>• Exhaustive transmit resource management and waveform selection (ETRMWS): This algorithm selects the waveform bandwidth and pulse length parameters with an exhaustive search-based approach, while the transmit power and dwell time are optimally designed by solving the optimization model (22). • Transmit waveform selection (TWS): This algorithm selects the waveform bandwidth and pulse length parameters with the PSO method, while the transmit power and dwell time of each radar node are fixed to be 80W and 2.5 × 10 -2 s, respectively. • Transmit resource management (TRM): The transmit power and dwell time are optimally adjusted by solving the optimization model (22), while the waveform bandwidth and pulse length parameters are fixed to be W = 0.5MHz and λ = 5µs, respectively. • Fixed transmit resource and waveform (FTRW): The transmit power and dwell time are set to be 80W and 2.5 × 10 -2 s respectively, while the waveform parameters are set as W = 0.5MHz and λ = 5µs, respectively. • Joint transmit resource management and waveform selection working in independent mode (JTRMWS-IM): This algorithm jointly optimizes the transmit power, dwell time, waveform bandwidth, and pulse length of each radar node, while the multiple radars work in independent mode without collecting and processing the measurements from different nodes. The tracking ARMSE at instant k is defined at the top of the next page, where M c represents the total number of Monte-Carlo trials, and [x m,k|k , ŷm,k|k ] represents the position estimate of the target at the m-th trial. Note that the achievable ARMSE represents the overall target state estimation accuracy during the whole tracking process. We can observe from those figures that the ETRMWS method is able to achieve the best balance between target tracking accuracy and LPI performance of radar network system, whereas its computational complexity is unacceptable in practice, which will be shown in Section IV-E. It should be pointed out that the proposed JTRMWS scheme aims to get close to the performance of ETRMWS approach. More specifically, although the TWS algorithm has slightly lower target tracking error, the corresponding probability of intercept is much larger than that of the JTRMWS scheme, where the illumination resources are ignored to be optimized to enhance the LPI performance. The reason is that, as aforementioned, both the transmit resources and waveform parameters have influence on the target tracking precision, whereas only the probing power and dwell time affect the LPI performance. On the other side, since there are more degrees of freedom for system optimization, i.e., the transmit power, dwell time, waveform bandwidth, and pulse length variables, the JTRMWS scheme outperforms the TRM and FTRM approaches significantly in terms of the attainable ARMSE and probability of intercept. As for the JTRMWS-IM algorithm, each radar optimizes its transmit resources and waveform parameters independently without collecting and processing the target measurement information from different nodes, resulting in a much worse target tracking error than that of the proposed JTRMWS strategy. Moreover, it is noticeable that the JTRMWS scheme shows very close performance to the ETRMWS algorithm, which confirms the robustness of our developed scheme. To be specific, the attainable ARMSE of the JTRMWS scheme is 7.3% higher than that of the ETRMWS approach, while the values of the achievable probability of intercept of the JTRMWS and ETRMWS algorithms are the same.• Exhaustive transmit resource management and waveform selection (ETRMWS): This algorithm selects the waveform bandwidth and pulse length parameters with an exhaustive search-based approach, while the transmit power and dwell time are optimally designed by solving the optimization model (22). • Transmit waveform selection (TWS): This algorithm selects the waveform bandwidth and pulse length parameters with the PSO method, while the transmit power and dwell time of each radar node are fixed to be 80W and 2.5 × 10 -2 s, respectively. • Transmit resource management (TRM): The transmit power and dwell time are optimally adjusted by solving the optimization model (22), while the waveform bandwidth and pulse length parameters are fixed to be W = 0.5MHz and λ = 5µs, respectively. • Fixed transmit resource and waveform (FTRW): The transmit power and dwell time are set to be 80W and 2.5 × 10 -2 s respectively, while the waveform parameters are set as W = 0.5MHz and λ = 5µs, respectively. • Joint transmit resource management and waveform selection working in independent mode (JTRMWS-IM): This algorithm jointly optimizes the transmit power, dwell time, waveform bandwidth, and pulse length of each radar node, while the multiple radars work in independent mode without collecting and processing the measurements from different nodes.

        <p>In addition, from Fig. 9 (c) and (e), since the transmit power and dwell time of each radar are set to be fixed values in TWS and FTRW methods, the probability of intercept of radar network system only depends on the distances between multiple radar nodes and target. When the target moves away from the radar network, the attainable values of probability of intercept decrease for both TWS and FTRW algorithms. As for JTRMWS, ETRMWS, TRM, and JTRMWS-IM approaches, the probability of intercept of the underlying system is not only a function of the relative distance between radar node and target, but also a function of transmit power and dwell time of each radar. Thus, the corresponding curves exhibit different variation tendencies. In Fig. 9 (f), one can also notice that the achievable probabilities of intercept of the JTRMWS and JTRMWS-IM methods are about the same, whereas the latter one shows worse target tracking performance as illustrated in Fig. 8. Overall, it should be noticed that the proposed JTRMWS scheme is able to not only reduce the target tracking error, but also improve the LPI performance of distributed phased array radar network, validating its advantages over other existing benchmarks. In this subsection, we expand the simulation in view of a different deployment of the distributed phased array radar network with respect to the target.

It can be seen that, although the above optimization results are quite different from those in Case 1, the same phenomena can also be found in Figs. 10111213, which imply that the transmit resource management and waveform selection results are determined by the relative geometry of the radar network with respect to the moving target.In addition, from Fig. 9 (c) and (e), since the transmit power and dwell time of each radar are set to be fixed values in TWS and FTRW methods, the probability of intercept of radar network system only depends on the distances between multiple radar nodes and target.
