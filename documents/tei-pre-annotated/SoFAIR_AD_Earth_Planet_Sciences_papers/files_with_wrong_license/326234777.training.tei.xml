        <p>Two hydrogen-rich materials, H 3 S and LaH 10 , synthesized at megabar pressures, have revolutionized the field of condensed matter physics providing the first glimpse to the solution of the hundred-year-old problem of room temperature superconductivity. The mechanism underlying superconductivity in these exceptional compounds is the conventional electron-phonon coupling. Here we describe recent advances in experimental techniques, superconductivity theory and first-principles computational methods which have made possible these discoveries. This work aims to provide an up-to-date compendium of the available results on superconducting hydrides and explain how the synergy of different methodologies led to extraordinary discoveries in the field. Besides, in an attempt to evidence empirical rules governing superconductivity in binary hydrides under pressure, we discuss general trends in the electronic structure and chemical bonding. The last part of the Review introduces possible strategies to optimize pressure and transition temperatures in conventional superconducting materials as well as future directions in theoretical, computational and experimental research.Two hydrogen-rich materials, H 3 S and LaH 10 , synthesized at megabar pressures, have revolutionized the field of condensed matter physics providing the first glimpse to the solution of the hundred-year-old problem of room temperature superconductivity.

        <p>When, at the turn of the century, the Nobel laureate V. L. Ginzburg was asked What problems of physics and astrophysics seem now to be especially important and interesting?, room-temperature superconductivity and metallic hydrogen appeared as number two and three on his list [4,5]. Both problems had challenged and fascinated solid-state physicists for almost a century but seemed impossible to solve. Recently, the picture has changed and a path towards a common solution of these problems has been found, through high-pressure hydrides.When, at the turn of the century, the Nobel laureate V. L.

        <p>Already in the mid-'30s, Wigner and Huntington [6] speculated that hydrogen could attain a solid metallic phase under pressure; Neil Ashcroft and Vitaly Ginzburg [7,8] at the end of the '60s discussed the possibility that such a phase could exhibit superconductivity at room temperature, but only recently, thanks to key advances in theoretical and experimental techniques, it was possible to make the crucial step from general plausibility arguments to accurate predictions and observations. In 2017 a (still controversial) report of a solid metallic phase of hydrogen appeared in the literature [9]. The observed metallization pressure is consistent with that predicted by the most accurate theoretical calculations, i.e. 400 GPa [10]. Although it is still challenging to reach this pressure in experiments, these conditions are common in the core of celestial bodies, and now it is well established [11] that a large portion of Jupiter's core is formed by hydrogen in a metallic liquid state.Already in the mid-'30s, Wigner and Huntington [6] speculated that hydrogen could attain a solid metallic phase under pressure; Neil Ashcroft and Vitaly Ginzburg [7,8] at the end of the '60s discussed the possibility that such a phase could exhibit superconductivity at room temperature, but only recently, thanks to key advances in theoretical and experimental techniques, it was possible to make the crucial step from general plausibility arguments to accurate predictions and observations.

        <p>At lower pressure, an alternative route to high-temperature hydrogenic superconductivity was suggested, through chemical precompression of the hydrogen sub-lattice in hydride materials [12,13]. As a consequence, in 2018, a new record of superconducting transition temperature (T c ) of -23 • C [2,3] was reported in a hydrogen-rich solid, LaH 10 . Superconductivity at room temperature, conventionally set at 300 K (27 • C), is only 50 • C away.At lower pressure, an alternative route to high-temperature hydrogenic superconductivity was suggested, through chemical precompression of the hydrogen sub-lattice in hydride materials [12,13].

        <p>What makes solid hydrogen and high-pressure hydrides different from previously-known superconductors? In contrast to the previous record-holders for superconductivity, such as cuprates and Fe-based superconductors where the high-T c is most likely due to a complex interplay between charge, spin and orbital fluctuations and lattice vibrations (phonons), superconductivity in hydrides is described by the conventional theory for superconductivity, which describes material such as aluminum, lead or niobium. What is different are the superconducting parameters that determine the critical temperatures, that are exceptional compared to all previously studied compounds. This happens because extreme pressures allow stabilizing chemical environments which would not exist spontaneously at ambient pressure.What makes solid hydrogen and high-pressure hydrides different from previously-known superconductors?

        <p>Before delving longer into the problem of superconductivity, we briefly introduce a few key concepts and definitions related to pressure, which will be one of the key actors of this Review. Pressure (p) is a thermodynamic quantity which plays an important role in modifying the properties of substances; for example, it can turn most semiconductors into metals. In this Review, we will distinguish two regimes: the first, high-pressure, extends from 1 to 100 gigapascal (GPa); the second, megabar pressure, from 100 GPa to the terapascal range (1000 GPa or 1 TPa). For comparison, 1 GPa is equivalent to 10,000 bar, or 9869 atmospheres. Thus, a pressure of 100 GPa (1 Mbar) equals roughly one million times the atmospheric pressure. Pressures in the megabar range are typically found in the interior of the planets: for example, the pressure in the core of the Earth ranges from 330 to 360 GPa [14], while that in Jupiter core is estimated to be above 1 TPa.Before delving longer into the problem of superconductivity, we briefly introduce a few key concepts and definitions related to pressure, which will be one of the key actors of this Review.

        <p>In order to understand how a solid can change when subjected to megabar pressures, let us consider a substance compressed at 200 GPa (2 Mbar). In most solids, this would correspond to a volume reduction of factor 1.5. In gases, the volume reduction can be more drastic [15]; for instance, the volume of hydrogen is reduced by a factor 10 from 0 to 200 GPa [16]. One can also estimate the free-energy change of the system induced by such compression. For this range of pressures, the pV term in the Gibbs free-energy, G = E + pV -TS is of the order of 10 eV per two atoms, i.e. it can easily exceed the energy of any chemical bond at zero pressure [17][18][19]. In other words, in a system subject to megabar pressures, chemical bonds are drastically altered, and new type of bonds may form. These arguments can provide a first hint on how high pressure may be used to form materials with physical and chemical properties different from ambient pressure and hence shed light on problems such as room-temperature superconductivity.In order to understand how a solid can change when subjected to megabar pressures, let us consider a substance compressed at 200 GPa (2 Mbar).

        <p>The quest for room-temperature superconductivity is a rather old one. The first superconductor ever measured, found by H. K. Onnes in 1911 [20], was mercury (Hg), an elemental substance that possesses a very low T c = 4.2 K. Such low temperatures require expensive helium cooling; hence, exploiting the characteristic properties of superconductors (vanishing resistivity, perfect diamagnetism) for large-scale applications would require materials with a substantially larger T c . More than a century has passed since Onnes' discovery; over the years, the field has continuously evolved, and materials with higher and higher T c 's have been discovered. However, the rate of T c increase has been extremely discontinuous: in fact, for almost 50 years , the maximum critical temperature was slowly increased with a rate of ≈ 0.3 K/year, until a maximum T c of 23.2 K measured in an alloy of Nb and Ge (Nb 3 Ge) [21].The quest for room-temperature superconductivity is a rather old one.

        <p>Higher values of T c seemed impossible to achieve, which led Cohen and Anderson to postulate in 1972 that a hard limit of 25 K must exist for the T c of conventional superconductors [22]. This idea, based on several misconceptions on material properties and stability limits, had a long-lasting detrimental impact in the field for the following decades. Over the last 20 years (2000-2020), the misconception has been proved false by three crucial discoveries: (I) Superconductivity at 39 K in MgB 2 [23], (II) high-T c superconductivity at 203 K in H 3 S [1] and (III) near room-temperature superconductivity at 250 K in LaH 10 [2,3]. High-T c cuprates, discovered in 1986 (max T c = 133 K [24]), and iron-based superconductors, discovered in 2006 (Refs. [25,26] max T c = 100 K), technically did not contradict the Cohen-Anderson limit, since in these cases superconductivity is not of conventional electron-phonon origin.Higher values of T c seemed impossible to achieve, which led Cohen and Anderson to postulate in 1972 that a hard limit of 25 K must exist for the T c of conventional superconductors [22].

        <p>Empirical arguments such as the Cohen-Anderson limit (and the earlier Matthias' rules [27]), became obsolete once accurate methods for calculating electron-phonon spectra of materials from first-principles became available towards the end of the '90s [28]. Indeed, the lack of a predictive theory for superconductivity was probably the main limiting factor to the discovery of new superconductors in the twentieth century. In 1966, Ted Geballe, after discovering a new compound with a record T c of 20 K, declared that ''there is no theory whatsoever for the high-transition temperature of a superconductor'' [29]. This statement is founded on misconceptions and does not reflect the actual evolution of the field. A fully microscopic theory of superconductivity had in fact become available a few years earlier. The BCS theory of superconductivity (1957) states that electrons in conventional superconductors are pairwise coupled via excitations of bosonic character such as phonons (lattice vibrations) [30]. The BCS theory assumes an instantaneous interaction between electrons and permits to describe quantitatively only a few, low-temperature superconductors. On the other hand, its strong-coupling diagrammatic extension developed in the '60s, i.e. Migdal-Éliashberg theory [31], was able to successfully interpret the experimental data for all superconductors known at the time, assuming a phonon-mediated interaction between electrons. However, at the time, Migdal-Éliashberg theory was mainly a semi-phenomenological theory, because its key ingredient, i.e. the electron-phonon spectral function, could not be estimated a priory for a given material, but only indirectly extracted from experiments. Thus, at that time, one could describe with a high accuracy an existing superconductor but not predict whether a given material would be a good (high T c ) or bad (low T c ) superconductor.Empirical arguments such as the Cohen-Anderson limit (and the earlier Matthias' rules [27]), became obsolete once accurate methods for calculating electron-phonon spectra of materials from first-principles became available towards the end of the '90s [28].

        <p>The situation has changed in this century, thanks to the development of quantitative methods for superconductivity [32][33][34][35][36][37], and accurate and efficient computational tools to calculate phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling [38][39][40][41][42]. The accuracy reached by computational methods for conventional superconductors is demonstrated by the periodic table of superconductivity for elemental solids, shown in the top panel of Fig. 1 .

        <p>A strong impulse to the development of computational methods for superconductivity came with the report of a T c of 39 K in MgB 2 in 2001 [23]. Although its critical temperature was not spectacular, compared to the record T c of the cuprates, MgB 2 possesses several features which had a significant impact on the future developments of the field: Superconductivity is of the conventional electron-phonon type; T c is distinctively higher than the Cohen-Anderson limit; from a material perspective, MgB 2 is chemically very simple and differs from the best conventional superconductors known until that time, which all contained heavy transition metals, such as vanadium or niobium. Being formed by magnesium and boron, two of the lightest elements of the periodic table, MgB 2 was a rare example of covalent metal [23] in which (relatively) high-T c superconductivity could be obtained using high phonon frequencies and large electron-phonon matrix elements.A strong impulse to the development of computational methods for superconductivity came with the report of a T c of 39 K in MgB 2 in 2001 [23].

        <p>That high-T c superconductivity could occur in compounds containing light elements was neither a new nor a particularly original idea. From a purely technical point of view, Migdal-Éliashberg theory does not pose an upper bound of temperature for the emergence of superconductivity and even suggests compounds with light mass as the most obvious candidates for conventional superconductivity. Indeed, metallic hydrogen had been proposed to be a high-T c superconductor as early as 1968. Metallic hydrides at ambient pressure, extensively studied during the '70s, on what we call the first hydride rush in Fig. 2, achieved maximum T c s around 16.6 K, which fell just below the Cohen-Anderson limit.That high-T c superconductivity could occur in compounds containing light elements was neither a new nor a particularly original idea.

        <p>Experience had further shown that at ambient pressure, most of light-element compounds are insulating, while conventional superconductivity requires a good metallic ground state. Indeed, covalent metals like MgB 2 are rare at ambient pressure; however, as we have seen, megabar pressures can actively modify the properties of materials and in particular, induce an insulator-to-metal transition in many substances. In 2004, Neil Ashcroft realized that the progress in high-pressure techniques, compared to the '70s, was such, that covalent hydrides could now be compressed to pressures so high to make them metallic, realizing an effective chemical precompression of the hydrogen sublattice [13]. Although history proceeded otherwise, we believe that the origin of the idea of chemical precompression in hydrides can be traced back to 1971, when J. Gilman studied the possibility of making a new form of hydrogen in a metallic state through the preparation of a covalent compound, LiH 2 F under pressure [12].Experience had further shown that at ambient pressure, most of light-element compounds are insulating, while conventional superconductivity requires a good metallic ground state.

        <p>A second hydride rush (see Fig. 2) started at the dawn of the 2000s with Ashcroft's paper and was characterized by an extremely rapid progress. The first metallic covalent hydride, SiH x , was metallized in 2008 [43]; the first high-T c high-pressure hydride, H 3 S, with a record T c of 203 K, was discovered in 2015 [1] and LaH 10 , with a T c of 250 K, came three years later [2,3]. The breakthrough discoveries of H 3 S and LaH 10 followed a completely different paradigm compared to all previous superconductor discoveries, i.e. they were the result of precise experimentation guided by accurate theoretical predictions. A full account of the circumstances is given in Section 2.A second hydride rush (see Fig. 2) started at the dawn of the 2000s with Ashcroft's paper and was characterized by an extremely rapid progress.

        <p>How did this paradigm shift occur? We mentioned previously that the possibility of predicting accurate critical temperatures (T c ) from first principles played a vital role. Equally crucial was the development of computational tools to predict crystal structures and phase diagrams of materials under given thermodynamical conditions, which was one of the most pressing open challenges for theoretical materials design [44].How did this paradigm shift occur?

        <p>To have and idea of the rapid progress in the field of superconductivity in high-pressure hydrides enabled by theoretical/computational methods for superconductivity and crystal structure prediction, the reader should take a look at the bottom panel of Fig. 1. This shows the periodic table of superconducting binary hydrides, constructed from all theoretical predictions available at the moment. For each element, we show only compositions with the highest-T c , predicted in the pressure range of 0 to 300 GPa (see Appendix for information on references). We count 61 superconducting binary hydrides; however, in order to assemble this table, many different pressures and compositions were analyzed, amounting to at least ten times as many distinct compounds. In red, we highlight those elements that form a hydride for which a superconducting transition under pressure has been experimentally measured, as of end of 2019: silicon, sulfur, selenium, phosphorus, lanthanum, yttrium and thorium. Notably, all measurements and predictions reported in the table were performed over the last ten years, and most of them in the last five.To have and idea of the rapid progress in the field of superconductivity in high-pressure hydrides enabled by theoretical/computational methods for superconductivity and crystal structure prediction, the reader should take a look at the bottom panel of Fig. 1.

        <p>Compared to the progress in the last century, the rate of material discovery in the last ten years is impressive. Given the complexity of high-pressure experiments compared to theoretical calculations, it is not surprising that predictions largely outnumber experimental realizations. For those hydrides where superconductivity has been measured, the agreement between theory and experiments is remarkably good (see Section 5). This makes theoretical predictions extremely valuable, since they allow to focus experimental research on specific, pin-pointed chemical compositions and in some cases also suggest favorable thermodynamic conditions for the synthesis. Undoubtedly, we are currently witnessing the beginning of a new era of superconductivity, where hydrogen-rich materials are the most promising candidates to deliver exciting discoveries. Our periodic table of superconducting binary hydrides shows that predictions of T c even higher than the current record of 260 K exist. Furthermore, the phase space left to explore is vast: ternary, quaternary and complex hydrides are still virtually unexplored. A third hydride rush is likely to open at this point and will reserve many more surprises.Compared to the progress in the last century, the rate of material discovery in the last ten years is impressive. Given the complexity of high-pressure experiments compared to theoretical calculations, it is not surprising that predictions largely outnumber experimental realizations. For those hydrides where superconductivity has been measured, the agreement between theory and experiments is remarkably good (see Section 5). This makes theoretical predictions extremely valuable, since they allow to focus experimental research on specific, pin-pointed chemical compositions and in some cases also suggest favorable thermodynamic conditions for the synthesis. Undoubtedly, we are currently witnessing the beginning of a new era of superconductivity, where hydrogen-rich materials are the most promising candidates to deliver exciting discoveries. Our periodic table of superconducting binary hydrides shows that predictions of T c even higher than the current record of 260 K exist. Furthermore, the phase space left to explore is vast: ternary, quaternary and complex hydrides are still virtually unexplored. A third hydride rush is likely to open at this point and will reserve many more surprises.</p>
        <p>Fig. 2 summarizes the progress of the field of hydrides, from the mid-'30s (Wigner-Huntington's paper) to 2019. The ordinate axis shows the approximate number of publications per decade (see Appendix for details). Although it is technically very challenging to filter the exact number of articles, these numbers serve as an estimate of the size and importance of the field. Between 1930 and 1960 the number of articles related to superconducting or metallic hydrides is of the order of a few tens. By the '70s this number has increased to several hundreds publications and doubled during the '80s (first hydride rush). The research on hydride-superconductors was eclipsed by the discovery of unconventional high-T c cuprates at the end of the '80s [45]. Consequently, during the '90s, the number of publications did not grow as expected. The field survived because hydrides appeared in other research contexts, predominantly as energy materials (hydrogen storage). The interest in hydrides was eventually revived at the beginning of the 2000s thanks to the maturity of high-pressure techniques and by the Gilman-Ashcroft's bold idea of chemical precompression [12,13]. More recently (2008-2019) the high-pressure hydride research was fueled by the experimental work of M. Eremets and collaborators (second hydride rush). The discovery of LaH 10 will likely trigger the third hydride rush. Based on the current publication rate, we foresee more than 10,000 publications over the next decades.Fig. 2 summarizes the progress of the field of hydrides, from the mid-'30s (Wigner-Huntington's paper) to 2019.

        <p>Although unveiling a new, potentially huge class of high-T c superconductors is extremely exciting, the identification of new routes for material discovery opened by accurate theoretical predictions has a much deeper significance. This work is consecrated to review the theoretical tools underlying the latest hydride discoveries, as well as the experimental techniques and methodologies that permitted to extend the range of pressures to the megabar range. Several useful reviews have appeared on the topic (see, for instance, Refs. [46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54]). However, we believe that some essential technical aspects have been, so far, overlooked.Although unveiling a new, potentially huge class of high-T c superconductors is extremely exciting, the identification of new routes for material discovery opened by accurate theoretical predictions has a much deeper significance.

        <p>The primary aim of this Review is to analyze the past, present and future of research in superconducting hydrides under pressure. The structure of the Review is as follows. Section 2 reviews the essential developments in experiments, including high-pressure techniques. In Section 3, we describe theoretical methods that made possible to understand and describe the mechanism of superconductivity at various levels and approximations. The computational tools that are currently used to predict crystal structures and phase diagrams of hydrides and, more in general, for materials are discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, we compiled a large number of studies, predictions and experimental results on these systems and analyzed representative examples of different classes of hydrides to understand their electronic structure and superconductivity features. Finally, in Section 6, perspectives are presented, and different questions are addressed: How vast is the chemical space of hydrides? What are the best strategies to optimize hydrides? How to decrease pressure and maximize T c ? Are there other systems where, similarly to high-pressure hydrides, high-T c conventional superconductivity could be realized? The last part is devoted to discussing the future developments in experimental techniques, theoretical models and computational tools which we believe will be necessary to tackle the challenges ahead. It is the hope of the authors that the Review will serve as a reference point for this exciting and rapidly-changing field.The primary aim of this Review is to analyze the past, present and future of research in superconducting hydrides under pressure.

        <p>Bridgman's heavy, metal-made and gross anvils dominated high-pressure experiments for almost fifty years until a new era started in 1959 when diamond was used for the first time as an anvil by Wier, Van Valkenburg, Bunting and Lippincott [56].

        <p>Further advancement in DACs took place in 1978 when Mao-Bell [57] introduced beveled diamond anvils, cracking the limit of 100 GPa static pressure. The full maturity of the DAC technology was reached in the mid-'90s with the rise of commercial DACs. These have introduced a broad array of characterization techniques and transformed the DAC from an exotic device, available only in a handful of centers worldwide, to a universal tool accessible to standard laboratories. By the year 2000s, pressures up to 200 GPa could be reached routinely, and a number of applications had been published, improving our understanding of matter under extreme compression [58,59].Further advancement in DACs took place in 1978 when Mao-Bell [57] introduced beveled diamond anvils, cracking the limit of 100 GPa static pressure.

        <p>One of the first accomplishment of systematic investigations at high pressure has been to map the structural phase transformation and the emergence of superconductivity in elements under strong compression [60][61][62][63]. The first studies focused on simple diatomic molecules (O 2 , N 2 , H 2 , among others) showing that, with applied pressure, rules of chemistry could change in unexpected ways. Oxygen is of particular interest because it shows magnetism at low temperatures and, under pressure exceeding 95 GPa, solid molecular oxygen becomes metallic [64] and superconducting with T c of 0.6 K [65].One of the first accomplishment of systematic investigations at high pressure has been to map the structural phase transformation and the emergence of superconductivity in elements under strong compression [60][61][62][63].

        <p>At ambient pressure, there are 29 elemental superconductors in the periodic table, none of which is an alkali metal [66]. The first alkali metal discovered to become superconducting under pressure was Cs [67], followed others [68][69][70][71]. Years later, Lithium was confirmed to be a superconductor at ambient pressure but at mere 0.4 mK [72]. Alkali metals are exemplary nearly free-electron systems [73]. One would expect that with pressure electronic bands should widen, and bandgaps close, leading in general to a ubiquitous metallic behavior [74][75][76]. It was surprising, yet counter-intuitive to observe that under pressure, these metals exhibit marked deviations from the free-electron behavior, transforming into semi-metallic or insulating states. Alkali metals represented a fertile ground of research for the scientist in the late '90s to early 2000s to study the exotic chemistry under pressure, and superconductivity is still one of their most fascinating properties.At ambient pressure, there are 29 elemental superconductors in the periodic table, none of which is an alkali metal [66].

        <p>Among Group-V elements, boron is particularly exciting. In 2001 with the report of T c of 11.2 K at 250 GPa, set a record pressure for both electrical conductivity studies and investigations of superconductivity in a dense matter [77]. Calcium is the element with the highest ever measured T c that under pressure reaches 29 K [78,79]. Interestingly, yttrium also shows a high T c at substantially lower pressures [80]. Other elements which exhibit superconductivity upon compression are phosphorus [81][82][83], which at ambient conditions exhibits a complex phase diagram [84][85][86][87] and under pressure acquires a much simpler cubic structure [88,89]. Other elements that undergo a long sequence of phase transformations are chalcogens [90] (sulfur [91][92][93] and selenium [94,95]), carbon [96,97], rubidium [98], barium [99,100] and rhenium [101] to name a few [63].Among Group-V elements, boron is particularly exciting.

        <p>Arguably, one of the most exciting surprises of the high-pressure chemistry/physics of materials [102,103] has been the discovery that superconductivity becomes more common under pressure and occurs with substantially higher critical temperatures [46][47][48][49][50]. After this brief compendium of selected examples of high-pressure phase transformations and the emergence of superconductivity in the elements, we review, in the following, details on techniques and devices that made these discoveries possible.Arguably, one of the most exciting surprises of the high-pressure chemistry/physics of materials [102,103] has been the discovery that superconductivity becomes more common under pressure and occurs with substantially higher critical temperatures [46][47][48][49][50].

        <p>The diamond anvil cell represents the icon [104,105] of high-pressure research. In order to keep the pace with the progress of science in other fields, its design and capabilities are continuously improving, permitting to attain higher pressures and deeper levels of characterization [106,107]. This tool allows studying matter at extreme conditions of density, which has implications for planetary, biology, chemistry and materials science [108,109]. Fig. 4 summarizes the characterization techniques combined with the DAC. These cover a broad range of spectroscopy techniques [110,111] and probes [112][113][114] including magnetic fields [115][116][117]. Besides, modern DACs allow for synthesis and in situ characterization within temperature ranges from milli to thousands kelvin [109,118,119]. The working principle of a DAC used in high-pressure experiments is simple: the sample is placed in-between two diamond surfaces and squeezed. However, in more elaborated experiments, a DAC can have a large number of interacting parts and minuscule components. In its essence, a diamond anvil cell consists of the body of the cell (base of the cell, piston, cap with screws for increasing pressure and springs to control separation), anvil seats, diamond anvils, and a gasket. All these components are illustrated in Fig. 5. In particular, the diamond geometry and the gasket are the crucial parts determining the performance of the device. These are discussed in the following sections, together with other relevant aspects such as pressure measurements and loading.The diamond anvil cell represents the icon [104,105] of high-pressure research.

        <p>As the name indicates, diamonds are the principal components of DACs. Diamond is known as the hardest material to occur naturally. This material is perfect for anvils because it also provides a window to observe the sample and study its properties with electromagnetic radiation from the far infrared (IR) to the ultraviolet (UV). In fact, diamond is transparent to nearly all visible electromagnetic radiation (with weak absorption in the IR range) and in the UV up to 220 nm (corresponding to its 5.5 eV bandgap). There is in principle no lower limit for the frequencies of the radiation. The features of the DAC strongly depend on the properties of the diamonds used as anvils. Diamonds can be categorized by (a) their origin (natural or synthetic), (b) the amount and type of impurities and (c) the diamond cut or shape of the culet (see right panel in Fig. 5). Natural diamonds are formed deep within the Earth below the core-mantle at depths of 140 km, while synthetic diamonds are synthesized in laboratories at the pressure of 10 GPa and temperatures over 2500 • C -High-Pressure-High-Temperature (HPHT). Additionally, diamonds can also be grown with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process from plasma at reduced pressures. Interestingly, diamonds from all three sources are used in high-pressure experiments. Synthetic diamonds produced by HPHT and CVD can be growth flawless. Such defect-free synthetic diamonds are typically useful for IR studies as they have deficient absorption, as well as for Raman studies, as they have low or negligible luminescence. Synthetic diamonds are currently the hardest known material.As the name indicates, diamonds are the principal components of DACs. Diamond is known as the hardest material to occur naturally.

        <p>Irrespective of the source, all diamonds are classified by the amount and character of impurities. Diamond can currently be doped only with small-size ions, such as H, Li, B, N, among others. The main impurity found in natural diamonds is nitrogen, the so-called nitrogen-vacancy-center. Boron is relatively easily incorporated experimentally in diamond, but boron-doped diamonds are rare in nature (known for their blue-pristine color, which mainly finds use in the jewelry industry). Within the nitrogen-doped diamonds, there are two primary types of families, distinguished by the number of nitrogen impurities per million particles. Type-I contain nitrogen inclusions of more than ten particles per million (ppm) and type-II (high purity) contain less than 10 ppm. On the other hand, synthetic diamonds contain impurities of Ni, Co or Fe, elements used as catalysts. While for CVD diamonds, these often contain hydrogen as an impurity, the product from reactive plasma.Irrespective of the source, all diamonds are classified by the amount and character of impurities.

        <p>Fig. 5 (center) shows in detail the essential parts that compose a DAC. Although its operating principle is simple and consists in bringing together two diamond surfaces, it requires highly precise machinery that works at micrometer accuracy. Piston-cylinder parts (left panel in Fig. 5) are crucial to pressurize and control the applied pressure and, since diamond is a very brittle material, it easily damages during operation. In particular, any contact between the surfaces (diamond culet) should be avoided. Another crucial component are the anvil seats, which are made of a durable material because loads with forces larger than 1000 kg produce significant stress at the contact with the diamond anvils. Usually, these seats are made of tungsten carbide. Although for X-ray measurements, where a large aperture is crucial, seats made of boron nitride, are preferable because of its transparency to X-rays.Fig. 5 (center) shows in detail the essential parts that compose a DAC.

        <p>The first models of DAC employed flat seats until Boehler [120] introduced seats with conical support, which offer a significant advantage over their former counterparts. They have a larger aperture for optical and X-ray measurements, and diamonds are better protected once loaded (as they receive support from the sides). Over the years, mastering the cutting of diamonds in unusual shapes and developments in surface (culet) preparation have made it possible to expand the use of DAC to electrical and magnetic characterization at static pressures well above 200 GPa [121][122][123][124][125]. The future of DACs foresees many more developments, mainly on two fronts: (I) Focus ion beam techniques will play a fundamental role in DAC, permitting to sculpt futuristic micro-anvils (&lt;20 µm) which will extend the range of pressure well above the 400 GPa, the ceiling pressure for one-stage DAC.The first models of DAC employed flat seats until Boehler [120] introduced seats with conical support, which offer a significant advantage over their former counterparts.

        <p>In the first DAC design, back in 1958, the sample was directly compressed between the two diamonds. It was in 1962 that Van Vakenbourg introduced the gasket in the high-pressure DAC technique. A gasket is a piece of metal sheet with a drilled hole for sample loading which leads to several advantages. It allows for achieving better control of the sample. Protects the diamonds from direct contact that may cause them to fracture. It helps to develop a more homogeneous gradient of pressure across the sample by confining it in a relatively small area. It allows the possibility to add a chemically inert gas or a liquid as a pressure transmitting medium. Also, the gasket gives the possibility to load the DAC not only with solid samples but also with samples that are gaseous at room pressure, as in the case of hydrides.In the first DAC design, back in 1958, the sample was directly compressed between the two diamonds.

        <p>The thickness of the gasket plays a role in specific experiments, for instance, in the case of gaseous samples that are very compressible. A significant amount of experimentation has to be carried out before finding the ideal compromise between the size and the geometry of the anvil (especially concerning culet sizes) before an ideal gasket-thickness is found.The thickness of the gasket plays a role in specific experiments, for instance, in the case of gaseous samples that are very compressible.

        <p>For electrical measurements, it is necessary to introduce an insulating layer between the electrodes and the metallic gasket. The preparation of electrodes for electrical measurements is a crucial step in all high-pressure experiments. As mentioned above the preparation of the insulating gasket and the fabrication of wires is not a standardized procedure and relies more on a trial-and-error approach. Different groups have mastered their approach to achieve the same experimental conditions.For electrical measurements, it is necessary to introduce an insulating layer between the electrodes and the metallic gasket.

        <p>For what concerns the electrodes for electrical measurements, there are three different approaches. (I) Manually crafted electrodes: for culets, less than 100 µm wide, the best compromise is to prepare electrodes made of platinum strips or other metallic foil and carefully place them in the DAC. Mao-Bell [129] and Shimizu et al. [69] first introduced this relatively simple approach. A clear disadvantage of this method is represented by the constraints on the size of the culet and of the measured sample. Although it takes many attempts before the tiny strip can be placed by hand inside a culet of around 20-30 µm, this approach has been shown to pay-off, see Eremets et al. [130]. (II) Focused ion beam lithography: this is a more appropriate method for creating electrodes in tiny spaces. The technique consists of shaping metallic electrodes directly on the diamond surface with the aid of focused ion beam ultra-thin lithography. Recently, Rotondu et al. [131] show the capabilities of lithography and the possibility of reaching pressure up to 240 GPa. The main advantage of this approach is the precision and control of the electrodes, while the focused ion beam does not have practical limitations on the size of the culet. Deposition of the electrodes with this technique can provide precision down to 20 nm. It has also been shown that the created electrodes can sustain an indentation of the metal gasket. Unfortunately, this technique has a very high cost which makes it inaccessible to most laboratories. (III) Sputtered electrodes: a third method is to sputter metals (Ti, Al, Ta, etc.) to form ohmic contacts directly on the diamond culet. This technology has been proven to be robust and has worked since the pioneering works of Das [132], Evan [133], and Werner [134]. In practice, the electrodes are made with the aid of a mask with four slits which covers the diamond culet. In some of the experiments in which one of us (M.E.) reported superconductivity in the H-S systems (see Section 2.2) a mask of aluminum foil was used. The diamond surface was first ion-etched for 30-40 s and subsequently sputtered to form ohmic contacts. After this, the metal contacts must be covered with gold or platinum to protect the electrodes from oxidation. In our (M.E. et al.) experiments -the electrodes in final assembling in a DAC can be seen in Fig. 6 -the resistance in the electrodes is about 100 Ω, which is suitable for detecting any change upon temperature. The sputtered electrodes can be connected externally outside the DAC with copper wires, platinum foil or silver paint. It is essential to mention that the sputtered electrodes adhere conveniently to the surface of the diamond. However, they only last a maximum of 2 to 4 weeks and, after this period, resistivity increases dramatically.For what concerns the electrodes for electrical measurements, there are three different approaches.

        <p>The most reliable procedure to measure pressures in the megabar range is to determine the volume of a known material and use its equation of state (EoS). The EoS of simple metals or other FCC compounds (NaCl, Au, Pt, Re) have been determined from shock-wave experiments and are a reliable pressure scale. The main disadvantage of this method is that it requires X-ray measurements, typically at synchrotron sources. In the low-pressure regime, a much more convenient technique for experimentation is to determine the pressure using the luminescence of ruby chips. Forman et al. [135] first introduced this technique using a small ruby. The shift of the sharp-line (R-line) in the luminescence of ruby under pressure was calibrated against the EoS and found to move uniformly up to 100 GPa with high reproducibility. As ruby is chemically inert, it can be manufactured in micrometer-sized and produce a good signal. This technique has been a real breakthrough in the high-pressure community and made it possible to conduct high-pressure experiments with DAC in standard laboratories without accessing X-ray sources.The most reliable procedure to measure pressures in the megabar range is to determine the volume of a known material and use its equation of state (EoS).

        <p>Alternative methods are employed to estimate the pressure beyond the 100 GPa limit. For a long time, it has been known that the Raman spectrum of the diamond anvil itself changes with pressure. Theoretically, the Raman peak evolution of carbon structures is well documented [136]. Hanfland and Syassen [137] reported in 1985 that the highfrequency diamond edge has a linear dependence on pressure, up to 300 kbar (0.3 GPa). Back in those days, they concluded that this shift could be hardly used for the determination of pressure mainly because the stresses at the tip of the loaded anvils are highly nonuniform and strongly depend on the geometry of the anvils, gasket among others. However, the accumulated experience has shown that the pressure dependence of the diamond edge is surprisingly universal and can be used for a reliable estimation of pressure. This pressure scale was introduced in 2003 by one of us (ME) [138] and subsequently extended for pressures up to 410 GPa by Akahama et al. [139,140]. Akahama also extended the study and analyzed different orientations in diamonds: the typical [0001] of the anvil axis but also [0111] and [0110] [141].

        <p>A large number of interesting systems in the hydride family are gases at ambient temperature which complicates loading samples into the DAC. A particular loading procedure, described in the following, is required for H 2 S and PH 3 . In order to prevent decomposition during loading, it is necessary to perform it at low temperatures. For this, the diamond anvil cell is to be placed into a cryostat and cooled down (with liquid He) to a temperature where most of the samples transform to their liquid phase. The left panel in Fig. 5 shows the inlet (rim) that introduces the gas into the chamber through a capillary. At room temperature, the piston moves close to the base at about 100 µm between the two anvils.A large number of interesting systems in the hydride family are gases at ambient temperature which complicates loading samples into the DAC.

        <p>In condensed matter physics, a substantial amount of research in the field of high pressure (post-Bridgman era) originated by the tantalizing idea of metalizing hydrogen, the Wigner-Huntington [6] transition, dating back to the mid-'30s. The metallization of hydrogen is seen as the holy grail of high-pressure research and has been a compelling subject of interest for many scientists, ranging from experimental chemists and physicists [9,10,[142][143][144][145][146], to theoreticians [147][148][149][150]. However, despite the significant advancement in high-pressure techniques and tools, the metallization of hydrogen in its solid phase has proved to be challenging [151][152][153][154][155][156][157][158][159][160][161]. The landscape in the field broke in 2004 when Ashcroft suggested chemically precompressed hydrogen-rich materials [13] as an alternative route to decrease the tremendous pressure necessary to metalize hydrogen. Eremets et al. [162] successfully proved the principle right in 2008 by metalizing silane (SiH 4 ). Although subsequent studies attributed these results to probable decomposition or the existence of other stoichiometries [163][164][165][166][167][168], this work remains the first substantial evidence of superconductivity in chemically precompressed hydrides at high pressure.In condensed matter physics, a substantial amount of research in the field of high pressure (post-Bridgman era) originated by the tantalizing idea of metalizing hydrogen, the Wigner-Huntington [6] transition, dating back to the mid-'30s.

        <p>This important discovery drove more by serendipity than is believed. Back in 2013-2014, a former Ph.D. student, ''Sasha'' Drozdov, and I started experiments on H 2 S following ideas proposed by Li et al. [169], on the possibility of metallization and superconductivity in dense hydrogen sulfide. Adding as a side note, that at the time many shared a skeptical opinion about the possibility of achieving high-T c in hydrides, and even doubted about the driving mechanism for superconductivity [170]. The calculations of Li et al. [169] seemed simple to verify experimentally since highly pure liquid/gaseous H 2 S is almost freely available. Within one month of experiments, we measured a T c ≈ 60 K at 170 GPa, a significant result for those days. It was in apparent agreement with the theoretical prediction that we were following (see Fig. 7).This important discovery drove more by serendipity than is believed.

This unexpected situation, which had not been predicted by theory, turned out to be more complicated to disentangle. We knew that it would be hard for this result to be accepted if we just plotted a resistivity drop at 150 K. The community is plagued by many claims of high-T c materials, most of them of doubtful nature. Therefore, we did not publish our first result but instead spent about eight months complicating our experiments to understand the reason for such scattered values of T c . Our main goal was to find a reproducible thermodynamic path to obtain temperatures of 190 K. We hypothesized that the abrupt emergence of T c (refer to Fig. 7) might be due to the increase in temperature (the pressure did not change much). Indeed, the samples pressurized ≈150 GPa at low temperatures (&lt;100 K) but warmed to room temperature showed a tremendous T c of the order of 200 K.

        <p>The value of the critical temperature was clearly at odds with Yanming Ma's group original prediction [169]. We came up with the guess that sulfur, known for its super-valency, could in principle have bound more hydrogen atoms than in H 2 S, and presumably, our samples had transformed to another hydride (H 4 S or H 6 S).The value of the critical temperature was clearly at odds with Yanming Ma's group original prediction [169].

We uploaded our work to arXiv on December 1st, 2014 [172]. It is important to remark that in the version submitted to arXiv, we (M.E. et al.) kept our original interpretation and that Duan's paper did not impact our work in any aspect, perhaps only by accelerating our submission. Note that the calculated T c amazingly coincided with our result. This perfect agreement with the experiment was accidental because, as it will be revealed later, standard approximations in the calculations such as harmonicity turn out to be detrimental for the correct description of T c . Immediately, computational and theoretical scientists associated our observation of superconductivity with the Im 3m predicted structure. At that time, it was not apparent that the experimental and theoretical phases coincided since we did not have X-ray data of the high-T c samples.We were preparing the manuscript and solving the issues on the isotope effect when Duan's paper appeared online on November 10th, 2014 [171] where theoretically another system (H 2 S) 2 H 2 , different from pure H 2 S, was considered.

        <p>In this section, we will briefly review some key aspects of the experimental work on sulfur hydride, focusing on the emergence of superconductivity at high pressure. The phase diagram of hydrogen sulfide was first studied by Shimizu et al. [173] back in 1995, by Sakashita et al. [174] in 1997 and revisited by Fujihisa et al. [175] in 2004. H 2 S is a typical molecular compound with a rich phase diagram. Infrared studies under pressure show that hydrogen sulfide transforms into a metal at pressures of about 96 GPa [174]. The transformation is complicated by the partial dissociation of H 2 S and the appearance of elemental sulfur at pressures larger than 27 GPa at room temperature. In principle one could attribute the metallization of hydrogen sulfide to the disassociation into hydrogen and elemental sulfur, the latter known to become metallic above 95 GPa [95]. It is worth mentioning that before 2014 there were no experiments or studies reported on hydrogen sulfide above 100 GPa. Thanks to the advent of computational tools to explore energetically-stable crystal structures under pressure (see Section 4), this material was revisited by Li et al. [169]. Unexpectedly, the authors showed stable, metallic phases of H 2 S, for pressures above 100 GPa, with superconducting temperatures of the order of ≈80 K at 160 GPa. Most importantly, they showed that elemental decomposition into sulfur is highly unlikely, in apparent contradiction with previous experiments. To address this apparent disagreement between theory and experiment, back in 2014, we (M.E. et al.) performed a series of experiments in order to stabilize the predicted phases of H 2 S under pressure.In this section, we will briefly review some key aspects of the experimental work on sulfur hydride, focusing on the emergence of superconductivity at high pressure.

        <p>In the H 2 S experiments [1], the loading occurred in a cryostat at temperatures where hydrogen sulfide is liquid. The DAC was placed into a cryostat and cooled down to 191-213 K (within the temperature range of liquid H 2 S) and then the H 2 S gas was inserted in the chamber through a capillary into the rim around the diamond anvil, where it is liquified. H 2 S and D 2 S gases of 99.5% and 97% purity, respectively, were used for all experiments. The filling of the chamber was monitored visually, and the sample was identified by measuring Raman spectra (see Fig. 9). After clamping the DAC, the system was heated to 220 K to evaporate the rest of H 2 S, and then the pressure was increased typically at this temperature. Pressure remained stable during the cooling within a 5 GPa deviation. It was found [1] that the low-temperature loading procedure seemed to be required to prepare samples with high T c . For instance, if H 2 S was loaded at room temperature, only sulfur was detected in Raman and X-ray scattering. Fig. 8 shows different images taken using optical microscopy during the transformation of the sample upon compression. These images are obtained with transmitting and reflecting light simultaneously. In the pictures, the blue parts indicate the optically-transparent gasket and yellow areas show reflection from the metal electrodes. Clearly, the sample is transparent at 9 GPa, it starts darkening at about 11 GPa and then becomes fully opaque at pressures between 30-40 GPa. Hints of weak reflections, possibly pointing to the onset of metallicity, appeared at 79 GPa. The reflection from the sample becomes comparable with that from the electrodes above 150 GPa. The sample is transparent at 9 GPa. Darkening begins at about 11 GPa, and the sample becomes opaque at a pressure between 30-40 GPa. Weak reflection (onset of metallicity) starts to appear at 79 GPa.

        <p>The 632.8 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used initially to probe the Raman spectra of hydrogen sulfide and to determine pressure. The Raman spectrometer is equipped with a nitrogen-cooled charge couple device and notch filters. The pressure was determined by a diamond edge scale as previously described [138] at room and low temperatures. Ultra-low luminescence synthetic diamond anvils allowed us to record the Raman spectra at high pressures in the metallic state. Fig. 9 condenses a series of spectra taken at different conditions of pressure and temperature. For pressure above 50 GPa, the characteristic molecular vibrations of hydrogen sulfide diminish considerably. Above this pressure, only a broadband at 1900 cm -1 remains. Vibron modes disappeared in D 2 S at a higher pressure of about 100 GPa. In general, the Raman spectra of hydrogen sulfide is complex and hard to analyze due to different factors: (I) the decomposition in elemental phases occurs in some cases (vibration of sulfur appear at low frequencies (60-200 cm -1 ). One could also see that annealing at room temperature produced stronger sulfur peaks, while operating the sample close to 200 K diminished the intensity of the peaks considerably. II) In contrast to the clear evidence of the presence of elemental sulfur, peaks belonging to elemental hydrogen (vibrons) were not observed despite the use of the ultra-low luminescence synthetic diamond anvils. Above 80 GPa a new phase appeared, which persisted up to 150 GPa in the metallic state. At 160 GPa the Raman spectrum disappears, likely because of a transformation to the β-Po phase [1]. In this figure (Fig. 9), the Raman spectrum of sulfur hydride is shown after the release of pressure from 208 GPa at room temperature. The spectrum is much more intense than those of sulfur in the metallic state at high pressures with non-confirmed evidence of phase transition at ≈180 GPa.The 632.8 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used initially to probe the Raman spectra of hydrogen sulfide and to determine pressure.

Ultra-low luminescence synthetic diamond anvils allowed us to record the Raman spectra at high pressures in the metallic state. Fig. 9 condenses a series of spectra taken at different conditions of pressure and temperature. For pressure above 50 GPa, the characteristic molecular vibrations of hydrogen sulfide diminish considerably. Above this pressure, only a broadband at 1900 cm -1 remains. Vibron modes disappeared in D 2 S at a higher pressure of about 100 GPa. In general, the Raman spectra of hydrogen sulfide is complex and hard to analyze due to different factors: (I) the decomposition in elemental phases occurs in some cases (vibration of sulfur appear at low frequencies (60-200 cm -1 ). One could also see that annealing at room temperature produced stronger sulfur peaks, while operating the sample close to 200 K diminished the intensity of the peaks considerably. II) In contrast to the clear evidence of the presence of elemental sulfur, peaks belonging to elemental hydrogen (vibrons) were not observed despite the use of the ultra-low luminescence synthetic diamond anvils. Above 80 GPa a new phase appeared, which persisted up to 150 GPa in the metallic state. At 160 GPa the Raman spectrum disappears, likely because of a transformation to the β-Po phase [1]. In this figure (Fig. 9), the Raman spectrum of sulfur hydride is shown after the release of pressure from 208 GPa at room temperature. The spectrum is much more intense than those of sulfur in the metallic state at high pressures with non-confirmed evidence of phase transition at ≈180 GPa.</p>

        <p>All the samples started to conduct at pressures of ≈50 GPa, in a semiconducting state indicated by the temperature dependence of resistance and by the presence of pronounced photoconductivity. At 90-100 GPa, the resistance drops further and the temperature dependence shows a metallic behavior, confirmed by the absence of photoconductive response. It is noticeable that during the cooling of the sample for pressures above 100 GPa the resistance dropped abruptly by three orders of magnitude indicating a transition to the superconducting state. A further increase in pressure resulted in consistently higher values of T c . Fig. 10 shows a summary of critical temperatures of superconductivity under pressure for sulfur hydride H x S and sulfur deuteride (D x S) samples. The highest measured T c is 203 K. A clear isotope effect, i.e. a shift of the T c to lower temperatures in the case of sulfur deuteride points towards a phonon-assisted mechanism of superconductivity. The BCS theory gives a dependence of the critical temperature on the atomic mass M as T c ∝ M β , for which experimentally we found β = 0.3 at 175 GPa. For further details see A.

In order to carry out this type of complicated measurements, a specialized miniature non-magnetic cell made of Cu:Ti alloy, working up to 200 GPa, had to be designed (see Drozdov et al. [1,176]). The first series of experiments consisted on performing resistivity measurements upon a variable magnetic field, which confirmed the shift of T c as a function of the magnetic field (roughly, a shift of 60 K in 0-7 Tesla).

        <p>Furthermore, the superconducting transition with T c = 203 K was confirmed by magnetization M(H) measurements at different temperatures. The clear diamagnetism in the Meissner phase is responsible for the initial decrease of the magnetization until the first critical field H c1 of 300 Oe is attained. A subsequent increase of the magnetization as the external field increases (due to penetration of magnetic vortices) confirmed H 3 S to be a Type-II superconductor. As the sign of the field change reverses, the magnetic flux in the Shubnikov state remains trapped, and the returning branch of the magnetic cycle runs above the direct one leading to the irreversibility of the magnetization curve.

        <p>Moreover, in-depth characterization of magnetization curves evidenced hysteresis, confirming a type-II superconductor (not shown). Magnetic hysteresis measurements were performed using subtraction of the background, determined in the normal state at T = 250 K. The magnetization curves, however, are distorted by possible paramagnetic impurities, often present in many other superconductors. We (M.E. et al.) reported the first critical field H c1 ≈ 300 Oe, estimated roughly from where the magnetization deviates from the linear behavior. At higher fields, magnetization increases due to the penetration of magnetic vortices. We have summarized the key points on the first experimental evidence of superconductivity in sulfur hydride and evidenced the record-breaking temperature of 203 K, using both electrical resistance and magnetic measurements. However, as discussed in the following sections (Section 5) hydrogen sulfide possesses a rather complicated phase diagram on which different compositions and structure phases emerge. Decomposition from the original H 2 S phase, loaded in our experiments, to H 3 S is likely to occur upon pressure. Experimental measurements of X-ray data by Einaga et al. [177] show that the superconducting phase is in good agreement with the theoretically predicted hexagonal and body-centered cubic (bcc) structures and coexists with elemental sulfur. Nevertheless, a phase mixture is also a possible scenario, since the precipitation of elemental sulfur upon decomposition could be expected [175] and we (M.E. et al.) measured the T c of sulfur at significantly lower temperatures (&lt;20 K). Another expected product of the decomposition of H 2 S is hydrogen. However, the body of experimental evidence does not support this scenario, since the steady characteristic vibrational stretching mode of the H 2 molecule is absent in Raman measurements. A complicated path of transformation is thus likely to happen to account for hydrogen-rich compositions.

A situation that is conceptually much simpler, as anharmonic corrections only amount to a renormalization of the phonon frequency. This scenario is likely to be accurately captured by a perturbative expansion. In the second case (right plot), the energy versus displacement profile has a shallow double minimum (non-perturbative regime). In this scenario, the harmonic approximation brakes down and the lattice would drift into a distorted configuration corresponding to one of the two minima. The anharmonic correction stabilizes the harmonically unstable phonons when the thermal amplitude or zero-point amplitude is sufficiently large.

        <p>Several approaches have been developed to deal with the problem of strong anharmonicity and are classified into two broad categories: those that rely on molecular dynamics (MD), and those that rely on the self-consistent field theory. Anharmonic effects at a non-perturbative level are treated within ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods [220][221][222][223]. These approaches are computationally expensive since they require long simulation times to converge renormalized phonon energies. Another intrinsic limitation is that they are based on Newtonian dynamics, limiting their application to temperatures above the Debye temperature. Path-integral molecular dynamics [224] overcome this situation by incorporating the quantum character of atomic vibrations, however at cost of increasing the computational load. To overcome the aforementioned limitations in AIMD methods, several DFT-based methods have recently been developed for the non-perturbative treatment of anharmonic effects in solids. These methods rely on the vibrational self-consistent-field theory [225,226] and the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory [219,[227][228][229][230], and can incorporate the effect of lattice anharmonicity at the mean-field level. In these methods, anharmonic phonon frequencies are calculated through the construction of effective harmonic force constants obtained self-consistently by repeatedly calculating atomic forces in supercells with suitably chosen atomic configurations. In both variants, perturbative expansions and selfconsistent field approaches, anharmonic corrections can be computed by a diagrammatic expansion [231][232][233][234].

The term becomes identically zero for optical modes whenever Wyckoff positions are locked by symmetry [235,236], while for the coupling with acoustic modes gives the thermal expansion. The last two terms (bubble and loop) describe respectively, three-phonon and four-phonon correlated interaction.

        <p>Fig. 18 shows a schematic view of a PES with hypothetically energy ranked crystalline structures. We recall that each point on the PES represents a single atomic configuration R. The stationary points on the PES correspond to a set of internal atomic positions and cell configurations for which forces acting on atoms vanish. These points are of utmost importance to predict the metastable structures and the thermodynamics of the system. These stationary points can be minima, where the system is locally stable, maxima (not energetically viable) or saddle points (transition points). Thus, the PES divides into regions each of them uniquely related to a local minimum [289]. These regions are called basins of attraction or catchment basins, defined as the set of configurations from which the steepest descent relaxation converges to the basin minimum. The bottom panel of Fig. 18 shows a schematic one-dimensional energy profile on which a set of neighboring basins form a super-basin structure, called funnel. Funnels are collections of basins from which the global minimum of the set is reached without crossing very high barriers. This means that the barrier to be crossed should not be larger than the average difference in energy between neighboring basins within the funnel.Fig. 18 shows a schematic view of a PES with hypothetically energy ranked crystalline structures.

        <p>In structural prediction methods, the goal is primarily to find the correct energetic ordering of dynamically stable local minima on the PES (a dynamically stable energy minimum is one whose Hessian is positive definite). This is equivalent to minimizing the Gibbs free energy G = U -TS + pV , whose components are the internal energy, temperature, entropy, pressure and volume of the system -U, T , S, p and V respectively. The stable configuration with the lowest Gibbs free energy corresponds to the ground-state structure and represents the most likely structure that a system will acquire at equilibrium conditions. The main task of a global optimization method is thus to find the lowest-energy structure among all local minima. As mentioned above, the number of such local minima on a high-dimensional PES increases exponentially with the system size [288]. It is impossible to identify the global minimum even for moderately-sized systems with simple enumerative search methods.In structural prediction methods, the goal is primarily to find the correct energetic ordering of dynamically stable local minima on the PES (a dynamically stable energy minimum is one whose Hessian is positive definite).

        <p>A methodology based on the premise that a large part of the PES of a reasonably large assembly of atoms corresponds to very high-energy structures, in which some atoms are much closer or far apart than their equilibrium bond length. Indeed, for most cases, the empirical evidence suggests that large portions of the PES correspond to fragmented structures, while local minima correspond to niches (localized areas) around basins of attraction [290]. All these undesired portions are avoided by imposing a priory constraints on the configuration space.A methodology based on the premise that a large part of the PES of a reasonably large assembly of atoms corresponds to very high-energy structures, in which some atoms are much closer or far apart than their equilibrium bond length.

        <p>Random structure searching requires very few external parameters and is relatively easy to implement. The biases are primarily controllable, logical and based on physical principles. It is also possible to condition or steer the searches by adding information from experiments, hypothetical candidates suggested by chemical or structural considerations on the system in question, as well as information generated by previous searches.Random structure searching requires very few external parameters and is relatively easy to implement.

        <p>Technically, a random search starts by generating a set of random atomic arrangements based on educated guesses of bond lengths. A random set of lattice parameters and angles between lattice vectors of the unit cell is generated, and the cell volume is renormalized to yield a random value within 50% of a chosen mean volume. Together with this initial random guess, an important step in these algorithms is the ''shake'', in which one performs a random displacement of the atoms and, if appropriate, a random adjustment of the unit cell. These atomic displacements (shakes) of a fraction of a bond length have a non-negligible chance of pushing the system into a nearby basin of attraction. This methodology has proven to be robust and highly reliable for finding (in an unbiased way) the global minima of systems with unit cells containing up to ≈12 atoms. Just before the price for the combinatorial complexity becomes too high to be acceptable.Technically, a random search starts by generating a set of random atomic arrangements based on educated guesses of bond lengths.

        <p>When the method was first proposed, the searches were conducted mostly at DFT level, but nowadays force-fields and other methods are coupled with random searches to improve the final efficiency. The most successful implementation of the random search methodology is the Ab initio Random Structure Searching (AIRSS) by Pickard-Needs [291,292]. In the context of high pressure, it has been largely used to propose and uncover new stable phases of hydrogen [293], aluminum [294], ammonia [295] and many other materials [296]. The corresponding code is released under the GPL2 licence and is tightly integrated in the CASTEP first-principles total energy code [297]. However, it is relatively straightforward to modify the scripts provided to adapt the method to other DFT-codes to obtain the core functionality.When the method was first proposed, the searches were conducted mostly at DFT level, but nowadays force-fields and other methods are coupled with random searches to improve the final efficiency.

        <p>Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a methodology inspired by the choreography of a bird flock. It is a distributedbehavior algorithm that performs multidimensional searches [298]. PSO belongs to the class of metaheuristic methods, as it makes few or no assumptions about the solutions. The algorithm works by moving particles (structures) in the search space based on efficient algorithms that use the position and velocity of the particles. Hence, all the individuals in the swarm can quickly converge to the global position and a near-optimal geographical position following the behavior of the flock and their flying histories.Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a methodology inspired by the choreography of a bird flock.

        <p>In practice, in PSO the behavior of each individual, a structure, is affected by either the best local or the best global individual which helps it to fly through a hyperspace (i.e. PES). A structure can be optimized by a feedback mechanism and learn from its past experiences to adjust its flying speed and direction (search areas). This methodology exploits symmetry constraints during structure generation, which tend to reduce the search space and enhance structural diversity. In particular, during the searches, a certain percentage of new structures is introduced at each generation to enhance structural diversity. PSO also uses structural characterization techniques to eliminate similar structures from the swarm. The algorithm then employs local structural optimization, which reduces the noise of the energy surfaces and ensures the generation of physically justified structures.In practice, in PSO the behavior of each individual, a structure, is affected by either the best local or the best global individual which helps it to fly through a hyperspace (i.e. PES).

        <p>Particle Swarm Optimization exists in two variants, based on global and local PSO algorithms, which have both been successfully used in many applications [299]. The global PSO has the advantage of fast convergence, while the local PSO is good at avoiding premature convergence and thus enhances the capability of dealing with more complex systems.

        <p>Evolutionary methods are a modern class of algorithms that rely on operations or principles inherited from genetic algorithms. In evolutionary algorithms, a population of candidate structures is evolved over successive iterations of random variation and selection operations (as in genetic algorithms). Random variation provides a mechanism for discovering new solutions. Selection determines which individuals are retained for further evolution. Solids represented through six lattice parameters (three unit-cell vectors and three angles), encoded as the lengths of the three lattice vectors and fractions of 2π , respectively. Each atom, represented by three coordinates, is expressed as a fraction of the corresponding lattice vector. In modern evolutionary algorithms, a given set of values defines one structure, and a locally optimized structure is called an individual. A set of individuals is called a population or, depending on the context, a generation. The comparison between different individuals is based on the corresponding fitness function (in this case, the fitness is the free energy or enthalpy). The simulation technically starts with individuals (structures) generated by some educated guess or in a completely random fashion. These structures then undergo evolution through a series of different genetic operations. New candidate individuals are obtained applying one or more variation operators to selected individuals. For every operation one or two individuals, depending on the type of operation, are chosen stochastically from the population. The probability of a given individual being chosen for a given operation is a function of the individual's fitness rank. To a predefined number of worst-performing individuals, a probability of zero is assigned. Once it has been selected for an operation, an individual is not removed from the pool, and thus it can be selected multiple times. The generated candidates are then scaled to a given unit cell volume, and those who do not fulfill some hard constraints are discarded. The remaining candidates are locally optimized (at DFT level), and at this moment new individuals are created. Each operation is repeated until the user-requested number of new individuals for this operation is produced. The total number of individuals generated by different operations equals the population size. After the calculation of the fitness value for each new individual, a new population is obtained by taking the best individuals from the combination of offspring and a user-defined number of best individuals from the parental population.Evolutionary methods are a modern class of algorithms that rely on operations or principles inherited from genetic algorithms.

        <p>USPEX, which stands for Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary Xtallography, is perhaps the most popular and by far the most used method among all those presented in this section. This methodology, originally described in Refs. [313,314] by Glass et al. introduces a unique number of features or variation operators: heredity, mutation and permutation [315][316][317]. In heredity, two individuals are selected and used to produce one new candidate. This is achieved simply by taking a fraction of each individual and combining these fractions to create new individuals. The fraction of each individual should be chosen to contain as much information as possible. The main information in a crystal structure is the relative position of the neighboring atoms. Thus, in order to conserve information, the fraction of an individual is selected, taking a spatially-coherent slab. The two slabs, one of each individual, are then fitted together, and the resulting structure is then rearranged by adjusting the number of atoms of each type to the requirements dictated by the chemical formula. In mutation, an individual is selected and used to produce a single new candidate: technically, this is done transforming the lattice vectors to new vectors applying a strain matrix. A permutation is used to produce a single new candidate; in this operation, two atoms of different types are interchanged. This operation, which is of course only possible for systems with different types of atoms, facilitates finding the correct atomic ordering. Another appealing feature is volume scaling; according to this operation, every produced candidate is scaled to a particular unit cell volume, before testing it against hard constraints and to local optimization. Thus, enhancing the performance for systems where the initial value of the volume is not sufficiently accurate. For each new generation, the new volume is obtained as a weighted average between the old and the average volume of the best individuals of the previous generation. A fundamental step, as in other methodologies, is to perform an efficient local optimization for each individual; this increases the computational cost paid for each individual, but reduces the search space to local optima, enhances comparability between different structures and provides locally optimal structures for further usage [318][319][320]. The 
            <rs type="software">USPEX</rs> software is free of charge and is provided as a robust and straightforward black-box tool to find the stable crystal structure of systems with up to several dozens of atoms/cell. Due to local optimization and the exploration of promising regions, many highly competitive metastable structures are found during the search. This method is interfaced with several ab initio codes, such as VASP, SIESTA, GULP, Quantum Espresso, CP2K, CASTEP, LAMMPS, etc. and has been used in the context of materials discovery [321] and high-pressure materials for superconductivity [73,[322][323][324].

        <p>Another package which implements evolutionary algorithms for crystal structure prediction is 
            <rs type="software">XtalOpt</rs>, An Open-Source Evolutionary Algorithm for Crystal Structure Prediction, by Lonie et al. [325][326][327]. 
            <rs type="software">XtalOpt</rs> features a periodic displacement (ripple) operator which is ideally suited for extended systems. It features hybrid operators, which combine two pure operators, thus reducing the number of duplicate structures in the search. It allows for better exploration of the potential energy surface of a given system. This software has been applied to explore hydrides under pressure [328,329] and is available under the GNU Public License. One main advantage for beginners is that it possesses an intuitive graphical interface and interfaces to force-fields and various DFT codes.

        <p>The minima hopping method (MHM) [331,332] consists of an inner part, which performs jumps to the local minimum of another basin, and an outer part, which will accept or reject this new local minimum. Fig. 19 shows the flowchart of this method. The acceptance/rejection decision is performed based on an energy threshold, i.e. a step will be accepted if the energy of the new local minimum E new is less than a given E diff higher than the current energy E cur . The energy difference threshold is continuously adjusted during the simulation so that half of the moves are accepted, and half are rejected. This condition, implemented in the outer part, introduces a preference for steps that go down in energy. However, if the inner part proposes only steps that go up in energy, in the end, also these steps will be accepted because after many rejections E diff will become sufficiently large. The inner part consists of a more complex escape mechanism that aims at moving from the current local minimum, followed by a geometry relaxation which will bring the system into another neighboring local minimum or will make it escape to another basin. The geometry relaxation is performed by a combination of standard steepest-descent and conjugate-gradient methods or more involved methods [333]. Initially, a velocity with random direction and a Gaussian-distributed magnitude is chosen for each atom. Amsler and Goedecker implemented a generalized version of the algorithm of minima hopping to periodic systems using variable cell shape molecular dynamics for the escape step [334]. The escape mechanism, in this case, is represented by a short molecular dynamics simulation run that starts from the current minimum. In order to optimize the escape steps, the initial atomic and cell velocities are aligned to low-curvature directions of the current local minimum. Thus, the system has enough energy to overcome energy barriers which are lower than the kinetic energy measured relative to the current minimum. If the kinetic energy is small, the system will arguably fall back into the current minimum; otherwise, if it is sufficiently large, the system will most likely be ejected from the current basin and end up in a different minimum. Softening works by aligning velocities towards soft directions, therefore biasing the MD simulation to efficient escape trials [335].The minima hopping method (MHM) [331,332] consists of an inner part, which performs jumps to the local minimum of another basin, and an outer part, which will accept or reject this new local minimum.

        <p>Another essential feature that MHM exploits, is the Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle [336], which states that ''highly exothermic chemical reactions have low activation energy''. Interpreted as ''it is more likely to find a low-energy local minimum if one goes from the current basin into a new basin crossing a low barrier than if one has to overcome a high barrier'' [337]. Since the early stages of its development, the MHM has proven not only to provide reliable solutions for the global minimum but also for nearby local minima, which can be of interest for many applications. It has been tested on a large set of materials classes [338,339], including superconducting hydrides at high pressure [168,340]. Although this package is not as popular as previously described algorithms, it is compelling and reliable for a large variety of situation and systems, including ternaries [341], Heusler-systems [342], etc. The code has an interface with several local structural optimization codes such as

        <p>Another method, similar at least in the name, is basin hopping [289], which exploits powerful Monte Carlo methods for the determination of the global minimum. This methodology advantageously transforms the potential energy surface: the value of the potential energy within one basin is replaced by the value of the basin minimum. The basin hopping method virtually eliminates the barriers between the basins of different minima, making it easy to connect them or to jump from one to the other. It is important to note that the basin hopping method does not eliminate the barriers between super-basins or funnels. On the other hand, the transformed piece-wise constant potential energy surface of the basin hopping method still exhibits barriers that have to be overcome by Monte Carlo steps. This methodology has not been used in the context of periodic solids, or to explore potential superconducting structures of hydrides at high pressure.Another method, similar at least in the name, is basin hopping [289], which exploits powerful Monte Carlo methods for the determination of the global minimum.

        <p>Stochastic simulated annealing-type algorithms to optimize global and local problems were introduced more than 35 years ago (1985). Being based on Boltzmann statistics, from a purely historical perspective, it is understandable that they were the first methods developed to tackle optimization problems. Nevertheless, it was not until the 90's that these techniques started to be used to help structure determination and to predict solid phases of elements. As a side note, the early development of these methods happened almost perfectly in parallel with the availability of commercial diamond anvil cells (see Section 2, which gave access to high pressure to many laboratories, opening the era of characterization of solid-phase transformations under pressure. However, at that time, addressing theoretically solid-phase transformations was considered a major, if not unsolvable, problem. There were a few brave attempts in this direction, see for example Refs. [343][344][345]. We refer in this context to the famous 1988 editorial note in Nature by John Maddox: ''one of the continuing scandals in the physical sciences is that it remains in general impossible to predict the structure of even the simplest crystalline solids from a knowledge of their chemical composition'' [44]. Back to our original storyline, simulated annealing algorithms were first introduced by Kirkpatrick et al. [346] and Čern ỳ et al. [347]. The great advantage of these methods lies in their relative ease of implementation and the very general applicability, regardless of the specific optimization problem [348]. In general, a simulated annealing algorithm employs random walker(s) to explore energy landscapes based on a few fundamental features that make it stochastic: First, a set of walkers that may or not interact with each other and learn from each other's steps. Second, a configuration space with an energy cost function which may remain unchanged or evolve as the algorithm proceeds. Third, a movement class, which for each state returns a neighboring structure that may or not be accessed with a certain probability (also this probability can evolve along with the algorithm or remain unchanged). Fourth, an acceptance criterion according to which the walker makes moves to the selected neighbor.Stochastic simulated annealing-type algorithms to optimize global and local problems were introduced more than 35 years ago (1985).

        <p>In principle, the algorithm starts from the current configuration i (random structure or well-educated guess). A neighboring configuration i + 1 is chosen randomly according to a set of rules (defined in the ''move class''). If the energy E i+1 is below or equal to E i , the move is always accepted, that is, i + 1 becomes the new current configuration. Otherwise, the move is accepted with a probability e -(E i+1 +E i )/C , where C is a control parameter of the random walk. Thus during a sequence of such Monte Carlo steps, the system can climb over barriers of the energy surface.

        <p>The general prototype of this type of algorithms is the so-called Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm, which describes a single walker at a constant temperature T . These algorithms explore ergodic regions, especially if T is varied, or if the landscape evolves during the simulation. The generalization of the Metropolis algorithm consists in varying the temperature during the run; this is what is called simulated annealing. Simulated annealing works by slowly lowering the temperature, which implies that the walker will move from average states (ergodic regions) to states with lower and lower energy. The premise of this algorithm is that if ones proceed slowly enough, and waits for a sufficiently long time, at the end of the simulation the walker will have found the global minimum of the energy landscape. Of all methodologies introduced so far, this is the only one for which one can is guaranteed to find the optimal solution, i.e. the global minimum (structure), at the end of the run.The general prototype of this type of algorithms is the so-called Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm, which describes a single walker at a constant temperature T .

        <p>A frequently used approach to reveal hidden correlations is the use of data-mining methods on large databases of computational [352] or experimental [353] material data. The approach is justified since compounds which are chemically similar also tend to exhibit similar crystal structures. Only by examining the behavior of neighboring elements in the periodic table, one may derive hints on stable compositions and crystal structures for hypothetical systems. Properties like electronegativity, atomic radii, number of valence electrons, valence electron energy or electron configuration could be exploited to discern trends in the search space.A frequently used approach to reveal hidden correlations is the use of data-mining methods on large databases of computational [352] or experimental [353] material data.

        <p>In this context, starting from the experimental data contained in the inorganic crystal structure database, Glawe et al. [354] used a statistical analysis to determine the likelihood that a chemical element A may be replaced by another B in a given structure. This information can be stored matrix form, associating to every pair (A, B) the corresponding likelihood of substitution. By ordering the rows and columns of this matrix to reduce its bandwidth, a one-dimension scale can be used to sort analogous chemical elements, i.e. the Pettifor scale. Alternatively, Goldschmidt's rules of substitution describe, for example, simple recipes to exchange atomic species in ionic crystals.In this context, starting from the experimental data contained in the inorganic crystal structure database, Glawe et al.

        <p>The Materials Project initiated by Ceder et al. [355] has been a pioneering attempts in this direction. Ceder's group developed several approaches based on data mining, combining high-throughput with ab initio calculations to predict ground-state structures of novel compounds [356]. This Data Mining Structure Predictor (DMSP) scheme relies on the idea that in alloys, a strong structure-structure correlation exists among different compositions due to underlying physical properties. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a probability distribution for the crystal structures of an alloy at unknown composition based on the already known crystal structures at other compositions. The data-mining techniques are limited only to structures already contained in the underlying database, limiting their use in crystal structure prediction. For example, applicability to high-pressure or high-temperature phases is restricted due to limited available data from theory and experiments. We expect that, thanks to new and rapid developments in the field, it will be soon possible to study high-pressure materials databases, specifically in the case of hydrides.The Materials Project initiated by Ceder et al.

        <p>An interesting methodology that aims at decreasing the high computational need for the creation of large-scale databases, for instance in materials under pressure, was proposed by Amsler et al. [357]. Although simple in spirit, this method estimates the enthalpy of stable compounds at ambient conditions with a linear approximation to the enthalpy (in the high-pressure limit) of compounds contained in databases of calculated materials properties. This work has successfully demonstrated that it is possible to explain the occurrence in nature of phases which are metastable at ambient conditions and to estimate the pressures at which such phases become thermodynamically accessible.An interesting methodology that aims at decreasing the high computational need for the creation of large-scale databases, for instance in materials under pressure, was proposed by Amsler et al.

        <p>As previously mentioned, the prediction of computer-designed materials is a formidable task, since it requires a thorough structure exploration with the computation of enthalpy and entropy functions, and also barriers for phase transformations between all competing phases under given conditions.

        <p>Fig. 20 shows examples of binary, ternary and quaternary convex hulls. To determine the ground state of a system at a given composition, one needs to identify the ordered compounds that have an energy lower than any other structure or any linear combination of structures corresponding to that composition. Mathematically, the convex hull of a set of x points, in the Euclidean plane or a Euclidean space, is the smallest convex set that contains x. In our example, the set of points representing ground-state structures forms a convex hull, while other structures (points) having an energy above the set of tie lines connecting the energy of the ground state ones are not stable. The convex hull thus reflects the relative Gibbs free energy of the compounds at zero temperature.Fig. 20 shows examples of binary, ternary and quaternary convex hulls.

        <p>The convex hull construction permits to visualize very valuable information, i.e. it can be used to derive a ''phase diagram'' of the compositions that in principle have the lowest energy and hence are accessible to experiments. Thus, a convex hull of the enthalpy in material science represents a rudimentary compositional phase diagram, in which the boundaries and eutectic points are not displayed. Fig. 20 shows real systems represented as convex hull phase diagram; an example of binary compositional phase diagrams is shown for H 2 O, in which the y-axis represents the formation energy per atom and the x-axis the composition. The stable composition obtained by combining H 2 and O 2 , represented by a green dot, is one of the most stable molecules in the universe, H 2 O. The black line shows the convex hull construction, which connects stable phases (H 2 to H 2 O to O 2 ). This line is also called the line of stability. The H 2 O 2 composition, which has a negative formation enthalpy to elemental constituents but lies above the line of stability, is not stable. Thus, the convex hull suggests that, likely, the only composition that will spontaneously form is H 2 O.The convex hull construction permits to visualize very valuable information, i.e. it can be used to derive a ''phase diagram'' of the compositions that in principle have the lowest energy and hence are accessible to experiments.

        <p>In the ternary case, one dimension is added; the energy axis is removed so that the entire compositional space can be represented. The ternary system (H, N, O) is now represented by an equilateral triangle, with three elements at its vertices and the nodes represent compositions for which the decomposition energies are zero (see the middle panel in Fig. 20). In the quaternary case, the chemical space becomes exceptionally challenging to explore and even to represent; we now use a pyramid to represent the B, N, O, H system. The complexity in compositions is evident: we have indicated on the plot an interesting stable point: B 5 H 12 NO 12 . The black lines in the ternary phase diagrams are projections of the convex hull construction into compositional space. The lines form Gibbs triangles, which can be used to find stable phases at arbitrary compositions. At any point in the phase diagram, other than the stable nodes, the equilibrium phases are given by vertices of the triangle bounding that composition. For example, the equilibrium phases for a composition with H:N:O ratio of 3:1:4, is predicted to be H 2 O, O 2 , NO 2 and N 2 . We will revisit the implications that this has for hydrides and superconductivity in a subsequent section.In the ternary case, one dimension is added; the energy axis is removed so that the entire compositional space can be represented.

        <p>Furthermore, it is, of course, reasonable to ask what the accuracy of a prediction based on convex hull formation energies is. For points (structures) which correspond to clear minima of the formation energy, like H 2 O, which has formation energy of a few eV/atom, it is arguable that this composition is the most stable. However, when one deals with challenging compositions and complex structures under high pressure, where configurations are energetically very close, it is much more problematic to discern whether or not a structure will form based on its formation enthalpy. What is the limit where we could consider stability or metastability for secondary phase structures or compositions? Sun et al. [358] were the first to address this question and suggested an energy differences of the order of 100 meV/atom among polymorphs of the same stoichiometry. This criterion is based on differences in properties such as entropy, volume, or surface energy and convoluted information from pressure, temperature, or the surface area between two systems. An energy difference of 100 meV/atom is sufficient to overcome a ∆S of 10 J/mol K, a ∆V of 2 Å 3 /mol, or a ∆γ of 2 J/m 2 . More recently, Aykol et al. [359] also evidenced the lack of a rigorous metric to identify which compounds may or may not be synthesized, and suggested a thermodynamic upper limit on the energy scale, above which the laboratory synthesis of a polymorph is highly unlikely. They defined this limit on the basis of the amorphous state and validated its applicability by effectively classifying more than 700 polymorphs in 41 common inorganic material systems of the Materials Project for synthesizability.Furthermore, it is, of course, reasonable to ask what the accuracy of a prediction based on convex hull formation energies is.

        <p>These estimates are relatively safe for drawing conclusions at zero pressure, and for cases analogous to those contained in the original dataset, however, it could be highly risky to extrapolate them to the high-pressure regime. In fact, both works reported that these values are strongly chemistry-dependent. In particular, the data sets of materials studied in the two works above do not contain hydrides under pressure. In hydrides under pressure, the existence of polymorphs stabilized via quantum effects (vibrational entropy) and the anharmonic effects of the hydrogen-related modes make predictions further challenging.These estimates are relatively safe for drawing conclusions at zero pressure, and for cases analogous to those contained in the original dataset, however, it could be highly risky to extrapolate them to the high-pressure regime.

        <p>A substantial number of DFT computer codes are available, and many of them differ considerably in the implementation details; this means that each of them tend to attain a different ''precision''. However, reproducibility of DFT results generated with different codes and approximations was recently addressed based on different benchmarks by an extensive worldwide collaboration. Studies of this type are critical to reassure the scientific community on the reliability of DFT results [376]. The study convincingly showed that despite the large number of codes, basis sets and different implementations solving the same equations, all codes lead to the same results, of course within a threshold error. Thus the community has a reliable and extensive array of available first-principles DFT codes (see for instance Ref. [377]).

        <p>Other methods. Structure prediction for condensed matter systems containing a large number of atoms (more than hundreds) is at present out-of-reach at the DFT level, even with the most efficient basis sets. If a many-atoms system is studied, it is preferable to decrease the computational cost for estimating energies and forces by one order of magnitude or more. There are packages such as 
            <rs type="software">GULP</rs> [378] and 
            <rs type="software">LAMMPS</rs> [379,380] (commonly used in the solid-state community) that implement accurate force-fields (FF), which permit to reach these goals. The term ''force-fields'' refers to the functional form of interatomic potentials used to calculate the potential energy of a system of atoms. The parameters of the energy functions may be derived from experiments in physics or chemistry, ab initio quantum mechanical calculations, or both. The obvious downside in the use of force-fields is the availability of transferable interatomic potentials for all atomic species under consideration. The density functional based tight-binding (DFTB) method represents an alternative method which combines the accuracy of DFT with the scalability of force-fields. It is based on a second-order expansion of the Kohn-Sham total energy in DFT to charge density fluctuations. The zeroth-order approach is equivalent to a standard non-self-consistent (TB) scheme, while at second-order a transparent, parameter-free, and readily calculable expression for generalized Hamiltonian matrix elements can be derived [381]. However, also, in this case, one needs parameters, the so-called Slater-Koster files (the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian operator and the overlap between basis functions centered on two atoms).

        <p>Basis sets. In Hartree-Fock or DFT methods the electronic wavefunction is expanded on a basis set to transform the partial differential equations (see Section 3) of the model into algebraic equations suitable for efficient implementation on a computer. The basis set used in a DFT code will largely determine its use and applicability to a particular class of problems and hence target a specific scientific community. Historically, Slater-type orbitals (STO) were the first type of basis sets available. However, STO proved to be extremely inefficient because required cumbersome numerical calculation of integrals. STO was followed by Numerical Atomic Orbitals (NAO) and basis sets based on the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals LCAO ansatz which provided a much better trade-off and ease of implementation. Gaussian-type orbitals (GTO) are by far the most often used in terms of numbers of codes and users, especially in the quantum-chemistry community. This type of basis set allows efficient implementations by exploiting the property that the product of two GTOs can be written as the linear combination of GTOs. Thus integrals with Gaussian basis functions can be written in closed form, and this leads to a considerable saving of computational time. In addition to localized basis sets, plane-wave basis sets can also be used in quantum-chemical simulations, and find vast applicability in periodic solids. Plane waves are in principle, a complete basis set. However, in practical implementations, the Hilbert space is truncated and only a finite number of plane-waves, typically defined by a kinetic energy cut-off, are included in the basis. By increasing the number of plane waves the solution is guaranteed to variationally converge to the exact one. In order to obtain convergence with a reasonable number of basis functions, in plane-wave codes, the full electron-ion Coulomb potential is usually replaced by a pseudopotential, which cuts all small-scale oscillations of the nuclear wave function close to the nuclei (see next section). Analogously to the plane wave basis sets, where the basis functions are eigenfunctions of the momentum operator, there are basis sets based on eigenfunctions of the position operator, that is, points on a uniform mesh in real-space. Actual implementations of this idea may use finite differences, finite elements or Lagrange sine-functions or wavelets [382].Basis sets.

This pseudo-wavefunction reproduces the correct behavior of the valance electrons wavefunctions, in the region where the chemical bonds are formed, but cuts out all short-range oscillations close to the nuclei, i.e. below a suitably-chosen cutoff radius. Core electrons are not included explicitly in the calculation, and this permits to reduce the number of plane-wave basis functions used to represent the density and the potential in the Kohn-Sham equations. Thus the pseudopotential approximation introduces an additional source of inaccuracy compared to all-electron approaches. However, for most solids, most of the pseudopotentials employed nowadays have achieved an accuracy practically comparable to that of reference all-electron calculations. This was possible thanks to years of pseudopotential developments, which have substantially increased the accuracy compared to the early norm-conserving pseudopotentials. A substantial step forward in the wide-spread use and improvement of pseudopotentials has been the development of website platforms in charge of producing and distributing standardized pseudopotentials, intensively tested and open to public scrutiny. The first in this effort was the PseudoDojo.org website, which gives access to the latest released version of pseudopotentials [386]. Another standard protocol proposed later on to verify publicly available pseudopotential libraries, based on several independent criteria including verification against the all-electron equations of state, as well as plane-wave convergence tests for several properties, including phonon frequencies, band structure, cohesive energy and pressure resulted in the Standard Solid State Pseudopotential (SSSP) efficiency and precision libraries [387]. Computational steps used to predict superconductors at high pressure. The first step is to explore the configurational space of selected compositions and build the convex hull. Many structure prediction algorithms are available and can be used at various levels of accuracy from classical to quantum mechanics. The second step is verification and consists of characterizing the vibrational properties of the thermodynamically-stable compositions. Available methodologies include among other MD, DFPT, and self-consistent phonons. The third step is accessing the superconducting properties for candidates. The great effort by the community has made it possible to predict room temperature superconductors without prior experimental knowledge. The extensive palette of available methods reflects the maturity of the field and further development of these methodologies will guarantee many more exciting discoveries. Presently the bottleneck is the computational cost involved in state of the art simulations. Strategies to reduce it are being investigated; the most promising appears to be artificial intelligence approaches.As alluded before, in the last years, the scientific community has made concentrated efforts to improve the efficiency and reliability of DFT codes.

        <p>A method for Brillouin zone sampling, which allows for fast, yet accurate, estimates of the total energy is particularly important when dealing with crystal structural explorations. It has been demonstrated that non-converged DFT calculations can lead to substantial biases in structure searches since the quality of the k-sampling determines the final accuracy of forces. The community primarily uses Monkhorst-Pack (MP) [388] meshes of k-points. A criterion that can be used, when comparing structures with different geometries, is to employ for each of them a MP mesh where the smallest separation among the k-points is below a fixed threshold.A method for Brillouin zone sampling, which allows for fast, yet accurate, estimates of the total energy is particularly important when dealing with crystal structural explorations.

        <p>A rule-of-thumb, based on practical experience, is to use a grid spacing of 2π × 0.07 Å -1 for structure searches and preliminary results, and 2π × 0.04 Å -1 to refine structures and obtain good energies.

For the cut-off energy in the plane wave expansions, preliminary tests have to be carried out at the beginning of the investigation; however, if one works with pseudopotential libraries where benchmark tests have been carried out before, it is advisable to start from these recommended values.A rule-of-thumb, based on practical experience, is to use a grid spacing of 2π × 0.07 Å -1 for structure searches and preliminary results, and 2π × 0.04 Å -1 to refine structures and obtain good energies.

        <p>The first step is to explore the configurational space of selected compositions and construct the convex hull. As described in previous sections, one can choose from a vast array of available methods. Despite different claims, in reality, all the methods are equally good, and there is not a method/software that is superior to others. Differences reside more in the tools that each package offers to process the data. 
            <rs type="software">Mainstream</rs> packages are robust, and users can certainly use them as black-boxes. On the other hand, less developed software packages typically provide only basic functionalities, perhaps less efficient implementations, that require the users to write their scripts for post-processing. Virtually all existing software packages for structure prediction are interfaced to DFT, DFT tight-binding or force-fields codes. In synthesis, the main aim in this step is to build a phase diagram (convex hull) to identify low-enthalpy compositions, once the PES has been sampled thoroughly with the method of choice.

        <p>The second step is a verification one, which consists in characterizing the vibrational properties of the thermodynamically-stable compositions. This step in most cases is performed using linear-response theory at DFT level, which assumes harmonic vibrations of the atoms around their equilibrium positions. Conversely, molecular dynamics or other methods to estimate anharmonic interatomic force constants are available. If phonon frequencies are real in the entire Brillouin zone, i.e. the predicted compound is dynamically stable, one can estimate the vibrational free energy and the zero-point energy contribution. Especially in hydrides, these terms have proven to have a significant impact on the energy ranking of configurations.The second step is a verification one, which consists in characterizing the vibrational properties of the thermodynamically-stable compositions.

        <p>The third step consists in characterizing the superconducting properties of the best candidates. For this, one needs to estimate the electron-phonon coupling spectral function (α 2 F (ω)), the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion, and solve the superconductivity equations. For a first, approximate estimate of the transition temperature, a safe choice is to use empirical formulas for T c such as the McMillan-based expression, Eq. ( 99). However, as described in Section 3, this approach becomes less accurate in the limit of sizeable electron-phonon coupling or in the case of systems with strongly anisotropic electronic properties. In this case, it is more appropriate to use other methods based on a perturbative Green's function approach such as the fully ab initio Migdal-Éliashberg approach (see Section 3.2.2, or advanced methods such as SCDFT (see Section 3.3).The third step consists in characterizing the superconducting properties of the best candidates.

        <p>In order to conduct DFPT calculations and electron-phonon properties of superconductors, the two most common choices are the popular, free-to-use plane-wave basis set codes: abinit [389] and Quantum ESPRESSO [390]. Both can also calculate higher-order derivatives and anharmonic (phonon-phonon scattering). A licensed code that is very popular and features excellent scaling together with a robust structural optimization routine is

Recently the use of graphical processing units (GPU) in conjunction with DFT calculations, has been proven feasible, resulting in the speed-up of computational time for systems with up to a thousand atoms [392]. However, this requires state-of-the-art supercomputers (CPU+GPU) that are still not available in most supercomputer centers. Moreover, force-field codes such as GULP or ab initio molecular dynamics methods are popular and accurate while being computationally efficient. These are often used to perform preliminary scans of the PES.

        <p>Historically, the first hint on the possible metallization of hydrogen dates back to 1926 [394], when J. D. Bernal suggested that any element should become a metal at high enough pressures. In particular, for a diatomic molecule such as hydrogen, the intermolecular distance decreases with pressure, until a single atom cannot be assigned clearly to one molecule or another, and the material becomes metallic, with all atoms approximately equidistant and all electrons uniformly distributed. Years later, in 1935, Eugene Wigner and Hillard Bell Huntington published the first paper in which they predicted that for pressure above 25 GPa hydrogen would become an alkali metal-like solid [6]. Decades later, in 1968, Ashcroft and independently Ginzburg in 1969 [8], evidenced a fundamental implication of hydrogen metallization, by predicting the possibility of high-T c superconductivity [7,8], based on BCS theory [30].Historically, the first hint on the possible metallization of hydrogen dates back to 1926 [394], when J.

        <p>In the '70s, the idea that hydrogen could achieve high superconducting critical temperatures, as explained in the Introduction, was simply too attractive and this stimulated the study of superconductivity in metal hydrides throughout the whole decade. One can clearly identify that the field of superconducting hydrides was born at the beginning of the '70s after Ashcroft's bold prediction of high-T c in elemental hydrogen. The rationale of the epoch was to focus on hydrogenated intermetallic compounds [396] hoping to find evidence of the exciting idea of hydrogen metallization. As a side note, we recommend the reader to read the Review of Maksimov and Pankratov of 1975 [397], which is an excellent piece of work that provides a deeper detail on the development of metallic hydrides during the '70s. The first metal-hydride ever synthesized and confirmed to be superconductor was Th 4 H 15 in 1970, which at atmospheric pressures had a non-negligible T c of 7.6 K [398]. This compound is also special historically because according to our bibliographic investigation, it was also the first metal-hydride to be a subject of high-pressure studies, back in 1974. An increase in T c to 8.5 K was meticulously measured upon compression [399].In the '70s, the idea that hydrogen could achieve high superconducting critical temperatures, as explained in the Introduction, was simply too attractive and this stimulated the study of superconductivity in metal hydrides throughout the whole decade.

        <p>The discovery of high superconducting transition temperatures in palladium [400,401] and other noble metal-hydrogen systems further fueled the interest in this problem [402] (see Fig. 3). We recall that the max T c at that time was ≈19 K for NbGe. As a matter of fact, the highest T c ever measured and confirmed for a hydride material at zero pressure is 16.6 K, measured in 1974 for PdCuH x [403]. Other hydrides subject of studies were HfV x H x (T c 4.8 K) [404], niobium-hydrogen (T c 9.4 K) [405] and hydrides of vanadium, zirconium, titanium and lanthanum, for which superconductivity was not reported, at least in the temperature range explored [406,407]. Important developments and predictions took place during the first hydride rush [397]. We believe that the origin of chemical precompression dates back to 1971 and should be attributed to J. J. Gilman, who studied the possibility of making a new form of hydrogen in a metallic state through the preparation of a covalent compound, LiH 2 F, under pressure [12].

        <p>The second hydride rush was triggered in 2004 by Ashcroft [13], who proposed to look for new superconductors in molecular hydrides such as SiH 4 and SnH 4 . Although the idea was not new, Ashcroft's paper provided novel perspectives and revived the field. Important concepts to guide the search for superconducting materials were re-introduced. First, in order to obtain an effective metallization of the hydrogen sublattice, it would be more convenient to start from an existing hydrogen-rich molecule, since in this case hydrogen does not have to be incorporated into a host metal lattice, as it was done in the '70s. Second, a chemical precompression (as Gilman suggested in 1971) mechanism can be exploited. In molecular hydrides, the characteristic distances between hydrogen atoms are reduced, as compared to the large values found in metal hydrides. Thus, covalent systems are of prime interest (as LiH 2 F). Third, the chemical precompression further reduces the pressure necessary for metallization and, more importantly, this pressure readily accessible to experiments.The second hydride rush was triggered in 2004 by Ashcroft [13], who proposed to look for new superconductors in molecular hydrides such as SiH 4 and SnH 4 .

        <p>Let us first focus on the low-pressure regime. The highest T c reported in this range of pressure is 50 K for H 2 S. We observe that at low pressures, the hydrogen to guest-atom ratio is dictated by the valence of the guest atom and superconductivity is found in three categories: Hydrides that show critical temperatures of the order of 40 K or higher are, besides H 2 S, the ones formed by Sc, Y and Li.

The highest T c reported in this range of pressure is 50 K for H 2 S. We observe that at low pressures, the hydrogen to guest-atom ratio is dictated by the valence of the guest atom and superconductivity is found in three categories: Hydrides that show critical temperatures of the order of 40 K or higher are, besides H 2 S, the ones formed by Sc, Y and Li. These compositions are thermodynamically stable and in principle should Computational predictions reported in the literature on binary hydrides.

        <p>Let us now examine the HP regime. The bottom periodic-table in Fig. 22 shows the highest T c in the 100-300 GPa range. Compared to low pressures, the most noticeable features are: a) there are many more hydrides reported with considerable higher T c and b) the table is cheerfully-colored, indicating that at high-pressure hydrides with high H-content are favored. The highest T c predicted in this range of pressure is for YH 10 with 326 K (not shown). However, recent experiments have set the experimental T c ≈240 K (see Appendix for references).Let us now examine the HP regime.

        <p>Note that, due to our choice to restrict the table to chemically-accessible pressures, some high-T c predictions such as Mg-hydrides are not included. It is fascinating that there are also many more hydrides predicted with astonishingly high-T c , including the whole La-series and group 2. On the opposite, transition metals seem doomed in the HP range and neither T c nor the H-content increase compared to low pressures. This evidences that the strategy followed during the '70s to maximize T c was bound to fail.Note that, due to our choice to restrict the table to chemically-accessible pressures, some high-T c predictions such as Mg-hydrides are not included.

Not all the studies reported in these articles were conducted with the same level of accuracy, convergence etc. By no means, the numbers reported here are guaranteed to be conclusive for a given compound (see for instance Ref.

Circumstances or cases in which theory/computation fails are well documented, and the reader can find them discussed elsewhere. Specifically, rare-earth-metals and actinides are theoretically challenging to describe, and one can quickly obtain wrong results applying standard density-functional theory.A word of caution should also be added at this point: these tables contain predictions extracted from a vast collection of published articles from many groups.

        <p>At high pressure, superconductors are eclipsing other materials that either do not metallize or do not show superconductivity, and yet form stable compositions. There is a clear trend in this sense, as elements of the second period such as C, N, O, F and 3d transition metals such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Zn do not form metallic hydrides under pressure. Notably, H 2 O, which is perhaps the most abundant and best-studied hydride, remains insulating up to the terapascal range of pressures [410][411][412][413][414]. Noble metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) show an outstanding resilience to hydride formation at ambient pressure. Experimentally there are no reports of stable compounds with a hydrogen molar ratio &gt; 1 at room temperature [415,416]. Through high pressure and in situ laser heating, H can eventually be incorporated in ratios higher than 1, but these compounds usually remain either magnetic [417] or/and insulating at HP [415].At high pressure, superconductors are eclipsing other materials that either do not metallize or do not show superconductivity, and yet form stable compositions.

        <p>One may realize that even two important theoretical arguments, such as the Ashcroft-Ginzburg (metallic hydrogen) and the Gilman-Ashcroft (chemical precompression) one offer an oversimplified picture of hydrides. The precompression paradigm assumes that the guest atom would only be exerting ''pressure'' on the hydrogen sublattice but not alter bonding or chemical properties. In this perfect scenario, superconductivity would be dominated by H states and occur at very high-T c (as it was predicted for solid metallic hydrogen). In practice, hydrides are incomplete realizations of this concept: guest atoms affect the chemistry of hydrogen and provide additional electronic and vibrational states strongly entangled with those of hydrogen, ultimately playing a non-trivial role in superconductivity.One may realize that even two important theoretical arguments, such as the Ashcroft-Ginzburg (metallic hydrogen) and the Gilman-Ashcroft (chemical precompression) one offer an oversimplified picture of hydrides.

        <p>For our analysis, it is crucial to have an understanding of the chemical bonding. We studied it based on the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) introduced by Dronskowki and Bloechl in 1993 [452]. 2 This type of analysis is 2 The COHP method permits to decompose the complicated energy-dependent electronic structure of a material into a sum of pairwise interactions between atoms, in a local basis framework, like tight-binding. The interaction between two atom-centered orbitals (say |φ µ ⟩ and |φ ν ⟩) is described by the Hamiltonian matrix element H µ,ν = ⟨φ µ | Ĥ|φ ν ⟩, which, when multiplied by the density-of-states matrix, measures the bonding, anti-bonding or non-bonding character of the corresponding electronic states if it lowers, rises or does not change the band-structure energy, respectively. This simple real-space interpretation of otherwise abstract reciprocal space information contained in the band structure, can result in a useful descriptor to understand the physical and chemical mechanisms through which (high-T c ) superconductivity is realized in different hydrides.For our analysis, it is crucial to have an understanding of the chemical bonding.

        <p>Background. After Ashcroft's suggestion of possible high-temperature superconductivity in metallic hydrogen [7], the hope to induce or increase the superconducting critical temperature of metals through hydrogen alloying lead to the discovery of superconductivity in Th [398] and Pd [400,401] metal hydrides. Hydrogen in these systems is at a relatively high concentration so that these hydrides can be thought of as alloys in which hydrogen (guest) and metal (host) atoms are both embedded in a common metallic environment. Elemental palladium is a transition metal which is not superconducting at ambient pressure. Interestingly, its moderate e-ph interaction (λ = 0.36) and characteristic frequencies (ω log = 180K ), would lead to a small, but non-zero superconducting T c . However, superconductivity is suppressed by paramagnetic spin fluctuations, with a coupling constant λ SF comparable to the e-ph one [41,453].Background.

        <p>Indeed, the phase diagram of PdH x is quite complicated: the crystal is stable for x &gt; 0.03 and superconductivity appears at x ≃ 0.7 with T c ≃ 5 K and further increases up to 9 K with a seemingly linear dependence on the H content. The proper determination of the structure of the crystalline phase of PdH x at various concentrations is a crucial question. In Pd-fcc lattice, there are two inequivalent interstitial sites, the octahedral site (O) and the tetrahedral site (T ). While at x = 1 both neutron experiments and first-principles calculations indicate that the O site is stable [454][455][456], a substantial T occupation is likely to occur at lower H concentrations. The existence of two different tetrahedral or octahedral absorption sites for hydrogen can be related to early [457] and more recent [458] reports of superconducting phases in PdH with very high-T c (300 and 62 K, respectively). Given metastable superconducting phases recently observed for other hydrides, the small energy difference between O and T site occupations can be accessed via thermodynamic conditions. Perhaps, slow or rapid quenching from the high-T phase may stabilize different a phase with substantial tetrahedral occupations, and improved superconducting properties. However, recent first-principles calculations [459] indicate that a full occupation of tetrahedral sites is detrimental for superconductivity since it decreases the electron-phonon coupling with H-derived modes, which is at odds with previous studies.Indeed, the phase diagram of PdH x is quite complicated: the crystal is stable for x &gt; 0.03 and superconductivity appears at x ≃ 0.7 with T c ≃ 5 K and further increases up to 9 K with a seemingly linear dependence on the H content.

        <p>A quite peculiar aspect of PdH is the existence of an inverse isotope effect. The isotope substitution of H with deuterium results in an increase of T c up to 11 K in PdD [401]. The inverse isotope effect relates to a strong anharmonicity of the phonon modes, which is also supported by resistivity, photoemission, inelastic neutron scattering and tunneling experiments [460][461][462][463][464].A quite peculiar aspect of PdH is the existence of an inverse isotope effect.

        <p>Only recently the complicated physics of PdH was put on firm grounds by first-principles calculations of phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling which include the anharmonic phonon contributions non-perturbatively. These calculations permitted to reconcile severe discrepancies between theory and experiments in the structural stability and the superconducting properties [237]. In particular, the inclusion of anharmonic corrections on the phonon spectrum strongly renormalizes the frequencies of the optical branches, yielding a much better qualitative agreement with experiments and stabilizes the lowest acoustical branch, which is predicted to be unstable at the harmonic level. More importantly, anharmonicity correct the severe overestimation of the superconducting T c found by harmonic calculations; T c reduces from 47 K (harmonic) to 5.0 K for PdH and 6.5 K for PdD (anharmonic). Calculations including phonon anharmonicity correctly reproduce the anomalous inverse isotope effect observed by experiments, although the calculated value of the isotope coefficient, α = 0.38, is about 50% lower than the experimental one [237]. The remaining quantitative differences may be related to Coulomb effects, which in Ref. [237] are treated in the µ * c approximation, or to anharmonic effects in the deformation potential, which were also disregarded.Only recently the complicated physics of PdH was put on firm grounds by first-principles calculations of phonon frequencies and electron-phonon coupling which include the anharmonic phonon contributions non-perturbatively.

        <p>In Fig. 24, we report the atom-projected DFT band structure and COHP. As shown, palladium-derived bands dominate the region near the Fermi level. These are d-states octahedrally split into e g and t 2g manifolds; the latter can form σ -type bonds with hydrogen in the rocksalt structure. Indeed, we observe a precise splitting of Pd-H hybridized states into a bonding (≃-10 eV at the Γ -point) and an antibonding (≃10 eV at the Γ -point) manifold. Compared to pure Pd, in which states sit at the Fermi level, in Pd-H, due to the presence of an additional H electron, the Pd-d states are full, and hence the Fermi surface consists of a single Pd-H band, which also has additional Pd-sp character. Note that the filling of the d-bands compared to pure Pd has the additional effect of reducing the spin fluctuations, which in Pd suppress superconductivity [453]. In the top panel of Fig. 24, we present the COHP as a function of energy for two different types of interactions (Pd-Pd and Pd-H). In this plot, and in all COHP figures that follow, we plot the negative of the COHP, so that positive and negative peaks indicate bonding and antibonding interactions, respectively.In Fig. 24, we report the atom-projected DFT band structure and COHP.

Indeed, we observe a precise splitting of Pd-H hybridized states into a bonding (≃-10 eV at the Γ -point) and an antibonding (≃10 eV at the Γ -point) manifold. Compared to pure Pd, in which states sit at the Fermi level, in Pd-H, due to the presence of an additional H electron, the Pd-d states are full, and hence the Fermi surface consists of a single Pd-H band, which also has additional Pd-sp character. Note that the filling of the d-bands compared to pure Pd has the additional effect of reducing the spin fluctuations, which in Pd suppress superconductivity [453]. In the top panel of Fig. 24, we present the COHP as a function of energy for two different types of interactions (Pd-Pd and Pd-H). In this plot, and in all COHP figures that follow, we plot the negative of the COHP, so that positive and negative peaks indicate bonding and antibonding interactions, respectively.</p>
        <p>The bonding Pd-Pd interaction is evident from the (positive) peak at ≃-4.5 eV, while the antibonding (negative) peak at ≃-0.4 eV is filled due to electrons donated by hydrogen. The first dispersing band (from -10 to -6 eV) has Pd-H bonding character, and the corresponding antibonding region is located from -2 to 3 eV. Bands crossing at the Fermi energy are responsible for electron-phonon interaction and superconductivity and are antibonding states derived both from Pd-H (the most significant contribution), and Pd-Pd interactions. The hydrogenic fraction at the Fermi level is estimated to be of the order of 5%, a rather small but non-negligible value.The bonding Pd-Pd interaction is evident from the (positive) peak at ≃-4.5 eV, while the antibonding (negative) peak at ≃-0.4 eV is filled due to electrons donated by hydrogen.

        <p>The presence of hydrogenic states crossing the Fermi level implies that the corresponding phonon modes should provide, to some extent, a sizable deformation potential. This seems to be the case (see Table 1): the Hopfield ratio I 2 /M = 0.08 that accounts for the part of the coupling that is independent of the phonon energy and of the electronic DOS, is three times larger than that of niobium (T c = 9.3 K). That hydrogenic mode are responsible for a significant part of the coupling can also be seen from the Éliashberg function (Fig. 29) which is weighted towards high energies with ω log = 53 meV. However the total electron-phonon coupling has a very small value λ = 0.4 and the computed critical temperature is very low (2.7 K3 ). This highlights a small drawback of hydrogenic superconductivity: high-frequency phonon modes provide potentially a large energy scale for the phonons that provide scattering (prefactor of Eq. ( 99)). However, since the same phonon energies also affect the coupling strength (λ), according to Eq. ( 100), unless the deformation potential I is strong enough, superconductivity is killed by the sublinear dependence of T c at weak coupling (Fig. 15). One could also make a step further and use Eq. ( 100) to compute the optimal phonon energy that would maximize T c . The optimal T c for PdH would be as high as 40 K, if ω log could be reduced to 20 meV. The critical temperature of 2.7 K computed in Ref. [237] including anharmonic corrections is however quite off with respect to the experimental value of 9 K. This inaccuracy can be ascribed in part to the µ * c = 0.1 assumption and to the sensitivity of T c to the phonon energies, which are strongly affected by anharmonicity. It is, in fact, possible that anharmonic corrections to the phonon frequencies have been overestimated resulting in modes that are too stiff, or that corrections to the deformation potential, not included in the calculation of the Éliashberg function, are relevant. As mentioned in the previous section, this suggests that more accurate calculations of anharmonic e-ph coupling and Coulombic screening would be necessary to obtain quantitative agreement with experiments in PdH.The presence of hydrogenic states crossing the Fermi level implies that the corresponding phonon modes should provide, to some extent, a sizable deformation potential.

        <p>To summarize, the presence of hydrogen in PdH is crucial for superconductivity for several reasons: (i) Hydrogen efficiently incorporates in the fcc Pd matrix at large stoichiometries (x ≈ 1). (ii) The hybridization between H and Pd states is sufficiently large to promote an anti-bonding Pd-H band at the Fermi energy. (iii) This band couples with H-derived phonon modes showing significant anharmonic effects. (iv) The additional electrons donated by hydrogen fill the Pd-d bands suppressing spin fluctuations that would otherwise prohibit superconductivity. However, the coupling provided by hydrogen is relatively weak. λ is comparable to the one in elemental Pd due to the considerable (anharmonic) phonon energies, effectively limiting the coupling strength.To summarize, the presence of hydrogen in PdH is crucial for superconductivity for several reasons: (i) Hydrogen efficiently incorporates in the fcc Pd matrix at large stoichiometries (x ≈ 1).

        <p>Background. Less than one year after the H 3 S result, the Eremets' group reported the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in phosphines under pressure [184]. PH 3 (phosphine) molecules have already the same hydrogen to host-atom ratio as H 3 S. Experiments reported that a mixture of this gas and hydrogen, loaded in a diamond anvil cell, becomes metallic at 40 GPa and eventually superconducting at 23). Assuming that metastable phases may actually be stabilized in experiments, the authors of Refs.

        <p>Background. At ambient pressure, the sulfur hydride is a molecular solid formed by H 2 S molecules, with a relatively complex phase diagram [169]. When placed in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, H 2 S easily absorbs hydrogen. In 2015, experiments showed that at pressure higher than 90 GPa the H 2 S+H 2 mixture becomes metallic and at about 100 GPa superconductivity appears with a critical temperature reaching ≈8 K at p ≈ 150 GPa [1] (see Section 2 for details). Upon further increasing pressure, while measuring the resistance up to room temperature, (to obtain reliable results), experiments showed a rapid increase of the critical temperature up to ≈200 K at p ⪆ 170 GPa, indicating a new superconducting phase. The measured shift of the critical temperature with applied magnetic field from 0 to 7 T endorsed the superconducting nature of the phase transition and the measure of an isotope coefficient of α = 0.3 upon H/D substitution, its conventional (electron-phonon) origin. The initial interest in the sulfur-hydrogen system was motivated by a key theoretical prediction by Li and coworkers [169], pointing to metallization and superconductivity of H 2 S. While this work exposed the field, it was later discovered that in experiments a second phase with H 3 S stoichiometry formed, with an unexpectedly high T c .

        <p>The first predicted H 3 S phase, which is stable from 111 GPa up to 180 GPa, has a R3m symmetry. In this phase, sulfur atoms occupy the lattice points of a (rhombohedral distorted) conventionally bcc cell and each of them is surrounded by three hydrogens, forming isolated H 3 S units [171]. The formation of a H 3 S phase is supported experimentally because the predicted superconducting critical temperature for this phase is ≈160 K at 130 GPa and rapidly increases with pressure, exactly in line with the experimental evidence. Starting at 180 GPa another structural transition is predicted, towards a Im 3m (bcc) phase, characterized by the symmetrization of the bonds between sulfur and H atoms, thus not forming isolated H 3 S units anymore. In this structure, shown in Fig. 23, the H atoms are symmetrically placed between two S atoms resulting in the formation of hydrogen-shared SH 6 units. Interestingly, the calculated [181,323,466] T c for the Im 3m structure at 200 GPa is ≈200 K, making it a strong candidate to be the high-T c phase observed in the experiments.The first predicted H 3 S phase, which is stable from 111 GPa up to 180 GPa, has a R3m symmetry.

        <p>The vibrational properties of H 3 S are characterized by low-energy (⪅ 75 meV) S-derived modes, these are separated from H-derived modes which extend up to ≈ 250 meV, once anharmonic corrections are included [466]. The latter show a clear separation into bending modes, ranging from ≈100 to ≈200 meV, and high-energy stretching modes from ≈200 to ≈250 meV, which are the modes most strongly coupled to electrons at the Fermi energy [466]. Calculation including anharmonic corrections predicts an isotope effect α = 0.35, sensibly reduced to the BCS value and in good agreement with experiments [466]. The total electron-phonon coupling constant (see Fig. 29) is λ = 1.84, which results in a critical temperature of 194 K (using µ * c = 0.1) at 200 GPa which agrees with the experimentally reported critical temperature of 190 K [1]. The large T c is due to the key role played by hydrogen vibrational modes and electronic states. Hydrogen contributes to about 45% of the states at the Fermi level, slightly less than it does in PH 2 , but still quite significantly. The Fermi level is pinned at a peak in the density of states, although the Fermi DOS is similar to that of other hydrides and not significantly higher. Hydrogen-related vibrational modes spread to high energies (≈ 250 meV) and yet, despite these large scales, these high-energy modes show up in the Éliashberg function as a broad high peak (Fig. 29) overcoming the negative effect of the ω -1 factor in the electron-phonon coupling (Eq. ( 15)). One can disentangle the effect of phonon frequencies in the electron-phonon coupling considering the I 2 /M factor in Hopfield formula Eq. ( 100): for H 3 S one gets I 2 /M = 1.46 a tremendous value, one order of magnitude larger than in PH 2 and about 40% of that computed for pure hydrogen (See Table 1). In short, H 3 S is exceptional because, while hydrogen only accounts for 50% of the Fermi DOS, these hydrogens are fully covalently bound together with sulfur, forming a full 3D network of conductive bonds. Besides, one should also consider that sulfur itself provides extra coupling, as S modes significantly enhance λ. Notably, elemental sulfur is a superconductor in the high-pressure regime (see Fig. 1).The vibrational properties of H 3 S are characterized by low-energy (⪅ 75 meV) S-derived modes, these are separated from H-derived modes which extend up to ≈ 250 meV, once anharmonic corrections are included [466]. The latter show a clear separation into bending modes, ranging from ≈100 to ≈200 meV, and high-energy stretching modes from ≈200 to ≈250 meV, which are the modes most strongly coupled to electrons at the Fermi energy [466]. Calculation including anharmonic corrections predicts an isotope effect α = 0.35, sensibly reduced to the BCS value and in good agreement with experiments [466]. The total electron-phonon coupling constant (see Fig. 29) is λ = 1.84, which results in a critical temperature of 194 K (using µ * c = 0.1) at 200 GPa which agrees with the experimentally reported critical temperature of 190 K [1]. The large T c is due to the key role played by hydrogen vibrational modes and electronic states. Hydrogen contributes to about 45% of the states at the Fermi level, slightly less than it does in PH 2 , but still quite significantly. The Fermi level is pinned at a peak in the density of states, although the Fermi DOS is similar to that of other hydrides and not significantly higher. Hydrogen-related vibrational modes spread to high energies (≈ 250 meV) and yet, despite these large scales, these high-energy modes show up in the Éliashberg function as a broad high peak (Fig. 29) overcoming the negative effect of the ω -1 factor in the electron-phonon coupling (Eq. ( 15)). One can disentangle the effect of phonon frequencies in the electron-phonon coupling considering the I 2 /M factor in Hopfield formula Eq. ( 100): for H 3 S one gets I 2 /M = 1.46 a tremendous value, one order of magnitude larger than in PH 2 and about 40% of that computed for pure hydrogen (See Table 1). In short, H 3 S is exceptional because, while hydrogen only accounts for 50% of the Fermi DOS, these hydrogens are fully covalently bound together with sulfur, forming a full 3D network of conductive bonds. Besides, one should also consider that sulfur itself provides extra coupling, as S modes significantly enhance λ. Notably, elemental sulfur is a superconductor in the high-pressure regime (see Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>Background. LaH 10 currently (end of 2019) holds the record for the highest T c ever measured among all known superconductors (≈250 K). It is a superhydride, which forms upon laser heating of lanthanum in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, and belongs to a large class of clathrates-like structures [187,188].Background.

        <p>Everything started, two years ago when in 2017, the Argonne group reported the synthesis of lanthanum superhydrides under pressure, through laser heating of lanthanum in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere [200]. The hydrogen to lanthanum ratio was estimated to be x ∈ [9,12], based on the unit cell volume. Due to the small X-ray cross-section of hydrogen, it is not possible to resolve the H sublattice directly, but only the La one, which was indexed as a Fm 3m, fcc lattice. The high-T c , fcc phase of LaH 10 , for which Li et al. predicted a T c of 280 K at 210 GPa, was thus suggested as the most likely candidate for the observed high-T c phase [188]. The central structural motif of the structure is a cage of hydrogens enclosing central La atoms, linked together by direct H-H bonds, see Fig. 23.Everything started, two years ago when in 2017, the Argonne group reported the synthesis of lanthanum superhydrides under pressure, through laser heating of lanthanum in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere [200].

        <p>A year later, in 2018, two groups reported superconductivity measurements on lanthanum hydrides under pressure. The first group reported a maximum T c of 215 K, around 200 GPa [191]. The second set of measurements reported T c 's as high as 260 K, in samples heated up to 1000 K at 180 GPa [3]. Finally, the same authors as in Ref. [192] confirmed a few months later a T c as high as 250 K in LaH x samples, but also reported the existence of several phases with lower and distinct T c 's, depending on the synthesis conditions [192].A year later, in 2018, two groups reported superconductivity measurements on lanthanum hydrides under pressure.

        <p>The same study contains other measurements, which are crucial to establish superconductivity and its conventional nature in LaH 10 : isotope effect (hydrogen vs deuterium substitution) and measurements of T c under magnetic field. Due to the problematic synthesis conditions, the linear dimensions of the current samples of LaH 10 (10-20 µm) are much smaller than those of H 3 S (up to 100 µm ). This does not allow a proper measurement of the Meissner effect. However, the authors show that indeed magnetic field suppresses superconductivity.The same study contains other measurements, which are crucial to establish superconductivity and its conventional nature in LaH 10 : isotope effect (hydrogen vs deuterium substitution) and measurements of T c under magnetic field.

        <p>The dependence of the critical temperatures on pressure reported by the two studies are also conflicting: while the Argonne measurements report an abrupt increase in T c up to 290 K [3], Ref. [192] reports a dome-like shape of the T c vs p curves. All the observations above suggest that, depending on the synthesis conditions, different phases with different stoichiometries and crystal structures may be stabilized by laser heating. The electronic band structure of LaH 10 in the high-T c (fcc phase) at 300 GPa is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 27. As a confirmation of the general trend, the states at the Fermi level derive from both the H sublattice and the La sublattice, even if in this case there is a more precise separation between La-and H-derived Fermi surfaces.The dependence of the critical temperatures on pressure reported by the two studies are also conflicting: while the Argonne measurements report an abrupt increase in T c up to 290 K [3], Ref.

        <p>The Fermi surface comprises six distinct pockets, centered around the BZ center and boundaries, formed by H 1s and La states bands, which hybridize along some directions of the BZ. The hybridization is mainly due to the presence of low-lying f -states of La, centered around 5 eV above the Fermi level. The surprising presence of a non-negligible contribution of f electrons to the Fermi level was already pointed out by Liu et al. [188], who observed that in LaH 10 not only s and p La electrons contribute to the DOS at E F , but also the f electrons. We remark that these states, being strongly localized, are usually not well described by DFT-like methods, and hence this seems to cast doubts about the reliability of the DFT results on this system. On the other hand, the fact that the high-T c properties computed in this system are very similar to other hydrides which do not contain f electrons, indirectly confirms the reliability of existing predictions. As evident from the band structure, at the Γ -point an electron-like H-derived band crosses E F and two other bands, of mixed La and H character, form electron pockets. States with dominant La character form hole pockets at the zone boundary.

        <p>In this case, the COHP decomposition (see Fig. 27) turns out to be fundamental to analyze the bonding properties of the system, which are quite intricate. First, we consider the H-H interactions. In the system, there are two nonequivalent H-H bonds, the nearest-neighbor H-H (1.06 Å) connecting H atoms forming the hexagons, and the next-nearest neighbors H-H bonds (1.15 Å) among H atoms forming the squares (see Fig. 23). The former interaction is covalent with occupied bonding states well separated from the unoccupied antibonding states (brown curve). The next-nearest neighbors (1.15 Å, square bonds) H-H interaction is different, showing that the antibonding states are populated (this feature is similar to what observed in other hydrides). The bonding states between La and H (averaged between nearest and next-nearest neighbors) are located at very low energies (they extend only up to -10 eV), while at the Fermi level the (hybridized) states are mainly non-bonding (COHP is ≃0.0). The states derived from the direct La-La interaction have a non-bonding character at E F , with populated bonding and antibonding states.In this case, the COHP decomposition (see Fig. 27) turns out to be fundamental to analyze the bonding properties of the system, which are quite intricate.

        <p>Phonons and electron-phonon coupling. The phonon dispersion of LaH 10 extend up to ≈3000 cm -1 . Due to the very different phonon mass of La and hydrogen, La and H modes split into low-energy modes with distinct La character, and high-energy modes with H character. The e-ph coupling is quite uniformly spread over all phonon modes, resulting in λ = 1.8 and ω log = 1490 K (values at 300 GPa from Ref. [188]), which yields a T c of 215 K using the modified McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula or higher values solving Migdal-Éliashberg equations, assuming a standard value of µ * c (0.1-0.13). In principle, anisotropic effects and anomalous Coulomb screening could strongly modify the calculated T c values. A firstprinciples study by Heil et al. [478] on the closely-related YH 10 system seems to rule out both possibilities. A more recent study, Ref. [190], confirm that these effects for LaH 10 can be neglected.Phonons and electron-phonon coupling. The phonon dispersion of LaH 10 extend up to ≈3000 cm -1 .

        <p>An interesting issue is the dynamical stability of the high-T c , fcc structure. According to harmonic DFPT calculations, the sodalite-like structure, which is the most plausible candidate for superconductivity is only stable above 230 GPa, while experiments measure a finite T c already at 130 GPa. The two most likely explanations are that: either anharmonic effects stabilize the structure to lower pressures (by an almost 100 GPa !); or that this structure represents a metastable phase synthesized by peculiar thermodynamical conditions [479].An interesting issue is the dynamical stability of the high-T c , fcc structure.

        <p>Electron-phonon coupling calculations [188] are available for p = 300 GPa. Éliashberg spectral function and coupling parameters, reported in Fig. 29, picture a system that is quite similar to H 3 S. Like in H 3 S, λ is in the strong-coupling regime. Furthermore, hydrogen significantly contributes to high energy phonons. The scenario is illustrated by the Hopfield decomposition of λ and the use of the McMillan-Allen-Dyes equation for T c . Table 1 shows that LaH 10 is akin to H 3 S: comparable Fermi DOS, and hydrogenic fraction, as well as an almost identical deformation potential. The only difference between the two is that the coupling is slightly shifted towards lower energies (see Fig. 29), so that the coupling constant λ is larger, leading to an increase in T c to 234 K. From this argument, one is tempted to conclude that LaH 10 is a better superconductor than H 3 S because of a slightly better tuning of the phonon energy to coupling ratio. The calculation of the optimal ω log using the Hopfield formula in the McMillan equation would indicate for both H 3 S and LaH 10 value of about 100 meV.Electron-phonon coupling calculations [188] are available for p = 300 GPa.

        <p>However, one has to be careful because actual calculations refer to a pressure (of 300 GPa) that is way higher than the pressure at which the system is measured ≃160 GPa. At this pressure, LaH 10 results to be neither thermodynamically nor dynamically stable (harmonic phonons). It is safe to say that, unlike for H 3 S the physics of LaH 10 is not fully unveiled.

The paper also pointed out that ab initio classical calculations predict a set of distort structures yielding a complex energy landscape, while quantum fluctuations ''wash out'' all the landscape complexity.

        <p>Here, we study the β-Sn structure, which, according to first-principles calculations, should be the first atomic phase of metallic hydrogen, stable between 500 GPa and 1 TPa [10,293]. In the atomic phases of hydrogen, the 0.7 Å bond, typical in all molecular phases occurring at lower pressures, is broken. However, both the β-Sn and the next stable structure, the R 3m one are relatively open, and H forms bonds of different types and lengths. Only at very high pressures (≥ 3.0 TPa), hydrogen is predicted to form genuinely close-packed (bcc or hcp) phases.Here, we study the β-Sn structure, which, according to first-principles calculations, should be the first atomic phase of metallic hydrogen, stable between 500 GPa and 1 TPa [10,293].

        <p>The electronic structure at 500 GPa, is shown in Fig. 28. Hydrogen in the β-Sn structure has an enormous bandwidth (∼40 eV), reflecting a considerable electronic kinetic energy. The band dispersion is very close to the free-electron one, except for ≈5 eV gaps opening close to the zone boundaries due to the strong unscreened electron-ion potential, responsible for the e-ph interaction. The corresponding Fermi surface is an almost perfect Fermi sphere, refolded into the Brillouin zone, with strong H-s electronic character, which exhibits tubular deformations around the zone boundary. The COHP function is shown in Fig. 28, resolved into the 1st and 2nd nearest neighbors H-H contributions. The plot clearly shows that the bonding is characterized by filled bonding states for nearest neighbors H-H interactions, clearly separated at E F from the antibonding states. Antibonding states from next-nearest interactions are on the contrary occupied starting from -10 eV; the 3rd n.n. contribution is non-bonding (not shown). At 500 GPa, the phonon dispersion (from Ref. [481]) extends up to 370 meV, a range comparable to the frequencies calculated for clathrate hydrides at similar pressures. The Éliashberg function reported in Fig. 29, shows that the coupling is spread quite homogeneously over the entire frequency range. The logarithmic-averaged phonon frequency (ω log = 166 meV) is larger than in other hydrides, partially reflecting stronger bonds and the massive applied pressure. Despite this, the e-ph coupling constant λ is the same as in H 3 S, leading to a larger T c = 282 K. The reason why λ can be high notwithstanding the sizeable average phonon energy lies in the larger I 2 /M ratio. An analysis of the optimal ω log , as done for PdH and other hydrides, indicates a maximum achievable T c of 300 K if ω log cold be softened down to 140 meV (see Table 1).The electronic structure at 500 GPa, is shown in Fig. 28.

        <p>Even in this case, the T c of metallic-solid hydrogen would remain in the same ball-park as those predicted for the best clathrate hydrides. In order to increase T c further, the only possible way would be to increase pressure. McMahon and Ceperley extended the study of superconductivity of hydrogen in its β-Sn structure up to 1.5 TPa (1500 GPa) [146]. At those pressures, T c is predicted to increase up to 500 K at ≈700 GPa and then experience a sharp drop. T c 's up to 750 K (at 2 TPa) have been predicted for the next stable H polymorph, the R 3m phase, which is not discussed here.Even in this case, the T c of metallic-solid hydrogen would remain in the same ball-park as those predicted for the best clathrate hydrides.

        <p>We have shown on the previous sections that ab initio calculations closely reproduce the superconducting properties of the five representative hydrides that we have chosen as examples. These compounds are in many ways all realizations of the Aschcroft-Gilman's arguments, but with very different outcomes. In fact, the actual superconducting properties vary from being marginal (as in PdH) to astonishing high, as in H 3 S or LaH 10 , depending on specific aspects of electronic structure and coupling -see Table 1. PdH, our first example, is a prototypical metallic hydride, where H is incorporated in the original fcc-Pd matrix at a small stoichiometry (x ≈ 1). This amount of hydrogen is sufficient to promote an antibonding Pd-H band at the Fermi energy, yielding a small and non-negligible fraction of H states at the Fermi level. These states are coupled with H-derived phonon modes showing significant anharmonic effects. However, the hydrogen contribution is not large enough to lead to a substantial e-ph coupling. The Hopfield factor I 2 /M, which gives an estimate of the e-ph coupling fraction independent of the electronic DOS and phonon spectrum, is merely 0.08, as opposed to ≈1.5 in H 3 S and LaH 10 . The resulting e-ph coupling constant is relatively weak (λ = 0.4), comparable to that of elemental Pd (λ = 0.36). However, compared to elemental Pd, the presence of hydrogen increases the phonon energy scale and yields a finite T c . Furthermore, due to a Fig. 29.

In fact, the actual superconducting properties vary from being marginal (as in PdH) to astonishing high, as in H 3 S or LaH 10 , depending on specific aspects of electronic structure and coupling -see Table 1. PdH, our first example, is a prototypical metallic hydride, where H is incorporated in the original fcc-Pd matrix at a small stoichiometry (x ≈ 1). This amount of hydrogen is sufficient to promote an antibonding Pd-H band at the Fermi energy, yielding a small and non-negligible fraction of H states at the Fermi level. These states are coupled with H-derived phonon modes showing significant anharmonic effects. However, the hydrogen contribution is not large enough to lead to a substantial e-ph coupling. The Hopfield factor I 2 /M, which gives an estimate of the e-ph coupling fraction independent of the electronic DOS and phonon spectrum, is merely 0.08, as opposed to ≈1.5 in H 3 S and LaH 10 . The resulting e-ph coupling constant is relatively weak (λ = 0.4), comparable to that of elemental Pd (λ = 0.36). However, compared to elemental Pd, the presence of hydrogen increases the phonon energy scale and yields a finite T c . Furthermore, due to a Fig. 29. Éliashberg α 2 F function computed for selected hydrides: PdH (0 GPa) [237], PH 2 (120 GPa) [185], H 3 S (200 GPa) [466], LaH 10 (300 GPa) [477] and H 2 (500 GPa) [481]. A vertical shift is applied for plotting the functions. The value of the integrated coupling constant λ and other key parameters are computed and collected in Table 1.</p>

        <p>Hydrogen incorporation in a metal framework is very far from the idea of chemical precompression, which implies a rearrangement of bonds into a dense hydrogen sublattice, only possible by overcoming energy barriers in the megabar range. PH 2 represents an intermediate step towards this idea. With respect to phosphine, which at ambient pressure forms an open crystal of PH 3 pyramidal molecules, a significant rearrangement of bonds occurs. At high pressure, the new structural motif is characterized by a two-dimensional square lattice of linear PH 2 molecules linked together by P-P bonds, but not H-H bonds. Due to the relatively high concentration of hydrogen, H contributes around half of the electronic states at the Fermi level. However, the open 2D structure is very inefficient in terms of e-ph coupling, and the Hopfield factor, although twice as large as in PdH, is almost one order of magnitude smaller than in the two other high-pressure hydrides, H 3 S and LaH 10 .Hydrogen incorporation in a metal framework is very far from the idea of chemical precompression, which implies a rearrangement of bonds into a dense hydrogen sublattice, only possible by overcoming energy barriers in the megabar range.

        <p>In the high-T c phases of H 3 S and LaH 10 , the effect of megabar pressure on the crystal structure is dramatic. In both structures, hydrogen is embedded in a closely-packed metallic network held together by strong covalent bonds. The superconducting properties are comparable to those of solid hydrogen. The COHP analysis shows that the states at E F have an antibonding character. In H 3 S, where sulfur is incorporated in the hydrogen lattice, the dominant interaction is of S-H type, while in LaH 10 the geometry favors direct H-H interactions. One may argue that LaH 10 , where only hydrogen is involved in covalent bonding, is a better realization of the Ashcroft-Gilman concept than H 3 S, and hence should exhibit a higher T c . However, the presence of another atom involved in the bonding seems to be marginal in this sense. In both compounds, hydrogen contributes roughly 50% of the total DOS at E F and dominates the phonon spectrum. This yields very similar values for the Hopfield factor and ω log . A ∼10% difference in the superconducting properties comes from a better optimization of the phonon spectrum. Differences in T c of this order can be easily be compensated by other effects, such as doping or pressure.In the high-T c phases of H 3 S and LaH 10 , the effect of megabar pressure on the crystal structure is dramatic.

        <p>It is interesting to compare e-ph coupling values of H 3 S and LaH 10 with those of atomic hydrogen at 500 GPa -see Table 1. Indeed, in the latter, the Hopfield factor is about a factor of three larger, but since the shape of the phonon spectrum is not optimized and the electronic DOS is low, the superconducting properties do not improve appreciably. Significantly higher T c is found in hydrogen only at much higher pressures, where the H lattice is denser and fully symmetric.It is interesting to compare e-ph coupling values of H 3 S and LaH 10 with those of atomic hydrogen at 500 GPa -see Table 1.

This hints to the imminent possibility of reaching room temperature (300 K) superconductivity in the coming years. However, practical applications of this type of materials are clearly hindered by the high pressures needed to stabilize their crystal structure and stoichiometry.

        <p>The first question to ask is, how big is the chemical abundance of hydrides? This may give an order of magnitude on the number of potential candidates for superconductivity. Let us start with binary hydrides (X H), which have been studied extensively. A reasonable estimate is to consider that, for each element X , in a pressure range between 50 and 300 GPa at least five compositions would lie in the convex hull of stability. Assuming that 60 elements could form a stable hydride and show superconductivity (a generous estimate), this gives a safe upper limit of 300 binary hydrides that exist, are thermodynamically stable and superconduct.The first question to ask is, how big is the chemical abundance of hydrides?

        <p>Providing an equally meaningful estimate for ternaries is considerably complicated because, at the moment, the knowledge of their phase stability and energy landscape is very limited. As the number of elements increases, the number of possible configurations rapidly grows and, at the same time, the number of channels for structural decomposition also increases. In addition, it is plausible that the role of metastability will be more crucial than in binary hydrides, i.e. metastable phases will prevail in some regions of the phase diagram, as decomposition paths become more complex. A very crude estimate can be obtained (at a single pressure) by a mere combinatorial argument. Similarly to binaries, we assume that ternaries can be formed with 60 elements of the periodic table. At a single pressure, not considering alloying, the number of possible, stable ternary hydrides compounds is 1770. However, there is no sufficient data to estimate how many structures will be on the hull of stability in the 50 to 300 GPa range. It is even harder to provide a reasonable estimate for quaternary hydrides, but the same analysis yields 34,220 combinatorial compounds at a single pressure, neglecting alloying, metastability and configurational disorder. The number of conceivable structures in complex hydrides is large and grows rapidly with the number of elements involved. Arguably, any experimental attempt for synthesis without prior knowledge from computation or theory is bound to fail.Providing an equally meaningful estimate for ternaries is considerably complicated because, at the moment, the knowledge of their phase stability and energy landscape is very limited.

        <p>We report our estimated numbers in Fig. 30 where, in order to give a perspective on the size of this chemical landscape, we compare it to other interesting classes of compounds. For instance, perovskites that are one of the most versatile and chemically diverse families [482]. There are currently approximately 2000 known compositions, but the number of perovskites predicted to be stable is close to 90,000 [483,484] at ambient pressure. Nevertheless, the number of accessible structures could potentially be much larger, especially if we include hybrid metal-organic perovskites under pressure [485]. Two-dimensional (2D) materials, have emerged as promising candidates for nextgeneration electronics applications.

Inorganic 3D lattices contained in the ICSD are above 200,000. The AFLOW database (http://aflowlib.org/) lists ≈1600 binary systems, ≈30,000 ternaries and 150,000 quaternaries. Finally, the estimated chemical space for drug discovery comprises several million structures and compositions [489], and this shows that, put in perspective, the challenge we face for material discovery in hydrides is relatively accessible.We report our estimated numbers in Fig. 30 where, in order to give a perspective on the size of this chemical landscape, we compare it to other interesting classes of compounds.

        <p>• Selected ternary phases: Due to the vast chemical space of ternary hydrides, a systematic search can hardly be afforded, and thus only a few studies, in literature, explore selected phases and compositions. For example, one can focus on ternary compositions stable at ambient pressure or attempt substitutions in binary hydrides, based on concepts such as chemical substitutability [354,490], or electronic structure arguments. A good starting point is to consider ternary doping of existing high-T c binary hydrides, as done by several authors who investigated different strategies of doping for H 3 S. Heil and Boeri [491], studied isovalent substitution of sulfur in H 3 S, with chalcogens (O, S, Se, Te) using the virtual crystal approximation to identify trends that would affect the T c . They evidenced that isovalent substitution of sulfur with oxygen or selenium, for example, modifies the superconducting properties by acting on the bonding rather than on the Fermi level position, which hints towards a general trend in hydrides under pressure. In particular, the authors predicted that a moderate oxygen substitution in H 3 S might enhance the T c , while substitution with heavier elements should be detrimental to superconductivity. In 2018, Liu et al. [492] performed crystal structure prediction calculations at a fixed composition of S 0.5 Se 0.5 H 3 and found that the lowest-enthalpy structures indeed correspond to different decorations of the cubic SH 3 lattice. Based on their electron-phonon calculations, the superconducting temperature decreases when S is replaced by Se, which the authors attribute to a decreasing strength of the covalent H-S or H-Se bonds. More recent calculations of thermodynamical stability of H 3 S 1-x Se x compound by Amsler [340] revealed that, when stable, the mixed S/Se compositions does not show improved superconducting properties. A similar strategy applied to superhydrides, this time inspired by the discovery of LaH 10 brought to the prediction of superconductivity at 258 K in CaYH 12 under pressure [493,494].• Selected ternary phases: Due to the vast chemical space of ternary hydrides, a systematic search can hardly be afforded, and thus only a few studies, in literature, explore selected phases and compositions.

        <p>An obvious starting point is to perform charge doping of existing metallic phases at high pressure through partial replacement of guest atoms. This strategy can be used, for example, to optimally position the Fermi level in a region of high density of states, modify the shape of Fermi surfaces, or induce structural or electronic phase transitions which increase the electron-phonon coupling. However, high-pressure doping presents inherent experimental difficulties, and thus this possibility has been explored so far only by computational studies. For example, it has been shown that hole doping of H 3 S with 6.25% of phosphorus at 200 GPa increases T c from 189 to 212 K [499] due to the positive effect of the van Hove singularity. On the other hand, electron doping achieved by 6.25% chlorine doping reduces T c to 160 K but has a positive impact on the pressure, lowering the stabilization threshold for the Im 3m phase. In a similar spirit, Ge et al. [500] proposed doping H 3 S with elements from neighboring groups in the periodic table and concluded that a T c as high as 280 K could be reached at 250 GPa in S 0.925 P 0.075 H 3 . However, the stability of other phases on the ternary convex hull could hinder doping of binary phases -a still unexplored possibility.An obvious starting point is to perform charge doping of existing metallic phases at high pressure through partial replacement of guest atoms.

        <p>A viable strategy to use doping in the search for new superconducting hydrides is to induce metallicity in insulating crystals. It is well known that by introducing enough electron-or hole-donating impurities a semiconducting system can be made metallic and even superconducting [501][502][503]. As a matter of fact, the class of molecular crystals containing light elements like carbon and hydrogen has a huge potential. Following this idea, Flores-Livas et al. [504,505] studied H 2 O and polyethylene, identifying promising substitutions/dopants and showed that for realistic levels of doping at high pressure, these covalent phases might exhibit superconductivity with a critical temperature of about 60 K at moderate pressures. Given the vast number of hydrides that are covalently-bonded but remain insulating up to rather high pressures, this venue represents a very promising route to hunt for high-T c hydrides (see for instance Ref.

Their simulations showed evidence of metallization at moderate pressures realizing a so-called physical compression effect, which, together with chemical precompression, extends the possibilities to study materials at reduced pressures. Nanoscaffold structures such as nanotubes or fullerenes are ideal systems that could exert further pressure on tiny molecules confined in their interior. A word of caution is, of course, that the stability of nano-scale systems and encapsulation of molecules may be very challenging to achieve experimentally.• Mechanical precompression: nano scaffolds: Recently, Xia et al.

        <p>• Non-hydrostatic pressure: Although non-hydrostatic conditions are preferably avoided in high-pressure experiments, if controlled, these effects may also represent a viable route to tune the electronic and vibrational properties of hydrides. However, controlling hydrostatic conditions is very challenging: while it is known that the lack of a suitable pressure-transmitting medium in the region of 100-200 GPa can lead to conditions of inhomogeneous pressure, it is hard to control these conditions in a reproducible manner. In fact, non-hydrostatic conditions are highly material-, and sample-preparation dependent [512].• Non-hydrostatic pressure: Although non-hydrostatic conditions are preferably avoided in high-pressure experiments, if controlled, these effects may also represent a viable route to tune the electronic and vibrational properties of hydrides.

        <p>A recent computational work by Liu et al. [513] attempted to examine the effect of non-hydrostatic strain modulation on H 3 S. This paper pointed out that applied strain can effectively modify the electronic energy levels and the lattice vibrational frequencies, thereby allowing a sensitive control over T c . Another attractive possibility to exploit nonhydrostatic conditions is to access metastable phases, which offer a unique possibility to enhance the electronic structure and consequently the superconducting properties of materials under pressure. For example, in the recent experimental work on LaH x , non-hydrostaticity seems to play a role in favoring some metastable compositions and structures [2,3].A recent computational work by Liu et al.

        <p>• Metastability: A number of examples have been recently reported, in which metastability adds an extra dimension to the phase diagram of several systems. This was observed, for instance, in elemental phosphorus [83], barium [100] and gallium under pressure [514], tin-nitrides under pressure [515], PdH [458], PH 2 [185] and LaH x [3,192], as well as chargedensity-wave superconductors [516] and oxides [517,518]. These works showed that controlled heating and cooling cycles or pressure-hysteresis cycles permit to stabilize different metastable phases selectively.• Metastability: A number of examples have been recently reported, in which metastability adds an extra dimension to the phase diagram of several systems.

        <p>Likely, at least some of the high-T c phases observed in high-pressure hydrides are also metastable at lower pressures.

        <p>Presently the main candidates for room-temperature and pressure superconductivity are unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates or iron pnictides and chalcogenides, which currently hold the record for the highest T c at ambient pressure. These systems are still heavily investigated and reserve many surprises. However, a clear advantage of conventional superconductors is that theoretical and computational methods can be used to guide the experimental discovery. The same can hardly be said about materials where exotic pairing mechanisms mediate superconductivity, since, in this case, a fully ab initio description of the superconducting pairing is missing [250].Presently the main candidates for room-temperature and pressure superconductivity are unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates or iron pnictides and chalcogenides, which currently hold the record for the highest T c at ambient pressure.

These methods allow creating completely artificial materials (FeSe/FeTe on graphene, STO), in which it is possible to induce or tune superconductivity [521]. The realization of low-dimensional 1D/2D metallic structures with light covalently-bonded elements (carbon, boron, nitrogen) represents an attractive possibility to discover high-T c superconductors at ambient pressure. Note however that conceptually these approaches are orthogonal to those used at high pressure, where very little can be controlled, and thermodynamic conditions dictate the synthesis.• Reduced dimensionality: A modern achievement in condensed matter research is the design of materials at the atomic scale, employing techniques such as controlled sputtering deposition [519], growth of hetero-structures atom-byatom, exfoliation and strain engineering with molecular beam epitaxy [520].

        <p>• Indirect role of hydrogen: Due to its strong ionic potential and high mobility, it is difficult for hydrogen at ambient pressure to be stable in any other chemical configuration than a fully saturated covalent bond. However, due to its small atomic size, hydrogen may be incorporated into existing materials and act indirectly to induce or enhance superconductivity. This is for example the case of palladium hydride, where hydrogen improves the superconducting properties of elemental palladium suppressing spin fluctuations [525]. This approach may not fully benefit from the low-mass/highphonon frequency argument, but may be essential to achieve high-temperature conventional superconductivity. An indirect key role of hydrogen is clearly seen in high-T c doped graphane; here, hydrogen saturates the π bonds of graphene, and, as a result, states with large e-ph coupling are promoted close to the Fermi level. When these states are populated through hole-doping, superconductivity has been predicted to occur at temperatures as high as 100 K [526]. Following the same line of thought, and using a MgB 2 monolayer as a template material, Bekaert et al. [527] predicted an increased critical temperature in MgB 2 from 39 to 67 K.• Indirect role of hydrogen: Due to its strong ionic potential and high mobility, it is difficult for hydrogen at ambient pressure to be stable in any other chemical configuration than a fully saturated covalent bond.

        <p>• Chemical doping: Charge doping through alkali metal incorporation has led to the discovery of a superconducting phase in fullerenes (C 60 ) [528], where the current T c record is 40 K in Cs 3 C 60 . Endohedral doping of the cages is often regarded as the most efficient approach to induce superconductivity, but exohedreal doping could also be an attractive alternative [529]. In the same spirit, stable cages of the sodalite-type structure can be doped with elements of the V, VI, and VII columns of the periodic table [530]. More recently, theoretical calculations have also predicted superconductivity in doped cages of ZnO [531]. Superconductivity has also been observed in intercalated graphite superconductors, notably CaC 6 (T c = 11.5 K) and YbC 6 (T c = 11.5 K) [532]. Other intercalated systems showing superconductivity are layered binary silicides [533], where it has been shown that, through a high-pressure synthesis procedure, the stabilization of metastable sheets of silicon leads to an enhancement of almost 30% in T c [534]. Estimates of superconductivity in the high-doping limit were given for generic families of intercalated group 4 honeycomb lattices [535]. Other examples of superconductivity induced by chemical doping include potassium-doping of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons molecular crystals like picene [536][537][538], phenanthrene [539], dibenzopentacene [540] and terphenyl [541,542], which have also been reported to exhibit critical temperature as high as 100 K [541,542].• Chemical doping: Charge doping through alkali metal incorporation has led to the discovery of a superconducting phase in fullerenes (C 60 ) [528], where the current T c record is 40 K in Cs 3 C 60 .

        <p>• Doping by field-effect: Modern techniques based on liquid electrolytes permit to achieve doping levels as high as 10 15 carriers/cm 3 , corresponding to tenths of electrons/atom, roughly three orders of magnitude larger than standard solid-state techniques. However, field gating does not act by simply charging the system but, due to the intense fields involved, can also lead to permanent or long-lived chemical or structural transformations in the region near the surface of the 2D systems. A fascinating speculation is that, since electrolytes usually contain hydrogen or light-elements, field gating may induce a sizable migration of H + ions onto the gated system, leading to a metallic transition and possibly to superconductivity. Such an insulator-to-metal transition has been unequivocally seen in hydrogen-doped WO 3 [543], where claims of induced superconductivity at 120 K were reported [544].• Doping by field-effect: Modern techniques based on liquid electrolytes permit to achieve doping levels as high as 10 15 carriers/cm 3 , corresponding to tenths of electrons/atom, roughly three orders of magnitude larger than standard solid-state techniques.

        <p>In this Review, we offered an up-to-date perspective on the field of conventional superconductivity at high pressures. The field has been recently fueled by the experimental discovery of two record-breaking hydrides, H 3 S (2015, 200 K) and LaH 10 (2018, 250 K). These materials, which currently hold the record for the highest and second-highest T c , are different in almost every respect from what would have been considered an ideal superconductor a few years ago. They have a rather simple stoichiometry, highly-symmetric structures and are standard metals that obey a conventional mechanism for superconductivity. Given the extremely rapid progress over the last five years, it is a safe bet to predict that hydrides will be the first class of materials where room temperature superconductivity (300 K) will be achieved in the coming years.In this Review, we offered an up-to-date perspective on the field of conventional superconductivity at high pressures.

        <p>Hydrides, despite their apparent simplicity when compared to more complex unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates and Fe pnictides and chalcogenides, do possess one aspect which makes them unusual. These materials require pressures more than one million times larger than ambient pressure in order to exist and superconduct. Currently, only a handful of groups worldwide can perform the complex characterizations needed to detect superconductivity at these pressures. It is important to realize, however, that the fact that the number of groups currently performing these measurements is so small does not imply that the necessary set-ups are impossibly expensive or sophisticated. Counterintuitively, a HP set-up such as the diamond anvil cell is considerably more accessible than even the cheapest scanning electronic microscope or ultra-high-vacuum deposition chamber. Many groups have access to commercial diamond anvil cells and can routinely reach megabar pressures. The main additional difficulty in the study of high-pressure hydrides resides in the mastering of techniques needed to detect the properties of superconductors under pressure. The particular set of skills and instruments have been developed only by a few groups through many years of careful experimentation.Hydrides, despite their apparent simplicity when compared to more complex unconventional superconductors, such as cuprates and Fe pnictides and chalcogenides, do possess one aspect which makes them unusual.

        <p>Currently, the main drawback of superconducting hydrides lies in the impossibility for any practical application, which limits their near-future interest to the level of basic research. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that this field will increase considerably in size and flourish, possibly delivering futuristic applications. In order to push this field forward, it is highly desirable to determine whether high-temperature conventional superconductivity can be extended to other hydrides which exist in the solid-state and, in the long term, whether the pressure can be drastically decreased. The large portfolio of existing hydrides, which includes energy storage and active materials for lithiumion storage, contains many promising materials for achieving this goal. Another route to find better superconductors is to apply the same concepts and methods that led to the discovery of high-T c superconductivity in hydrides to other compounds.Currently, the main drawback of superconducting hydrides lies in the impossibility for any practical application, which limits their near-future interest to the level of basic research.

A few months after we completed the first version, several important papers have appeared, reporting the observation of superconductivity in yttrium hydride at 240 K [203,204], and in thorium hydride at 170 K [202], as well as the prediction of room temperature superconductivity in the Li 2 MgH 16 system [195,562]. Moreover, a thorough theoretical explanation of the open issues in LaH 10 has also been formulated [190]. For the revised version of this Review, January 2020, we updated the relevant references and figures, but not included an in-depth description of the results.</p>

        <p>Our estimation is lower than that in Ref.[237] because we have opted for a conventional value µ * c = 0.1. This choice was made to allow a comparison between all selected hydrides on the same ground.Our estimation is lower than that in Ref.[237] because we have opted for a conventional value µ * c = 0.1.

        <p>Note that the term hydride is an old concept and could have several definitions. For example, Gibbs used it to describe a compound in which there is a metal-to-hydrogen bond. Along this Review we treated hydride only as a combination of hydrogen and any other element. Under this definition, hydrides can be generally classified into four categories based on the nature of their hydrogen bonding: ionic or saline (i.e., hydrides of alkali and alkaline earth metals), covalent or volatile (i.e., hydrides of Group IIIA-VIIA elements), metallic (i.e., hydrides of transition metals), or vdW (i.e., hydrides of rare gas elements). It is clear that this classification does not offer a complete vision of hydrides as the nature of the hydrogen bond can be significantly altered by pressure. As such, for simplicity in the construction of periodic tables (Figs. 22 and1) we omit the naming of compounds accordingly to chemistry conventions. For example note that in the periodic table, H 3 S appears as SH 3 . It also neglects further distinctions such as superhydrides, which have unusually high hydrogen contents (e.g., LaH 10 ).Note that the term hydride is an old concept and could have several definitions.

        <p>In order to track the number of publications on the field (see Fig. 2) we used 
            <rs type="software">Google scholar</rs> engine together with searches and keywords such as -hydrides-followed by filtering options with -superconducting -over the selected interval. Needless to mention that these numbers are approximate, especially on decades when hydrides started to be explored on other domains such as energy materials.
