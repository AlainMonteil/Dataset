        <p>In natural ecosystems, the efficiency of energy transfer from resources to consumers determines the biomass structure of food webs. As a general rule, about 10% of the energy produced in one trophic level makes it up to the next 1-3 . Recent theory suggests this energy transfer could be further constrained if rising temperatures increase metabolic growth costs 4 , although experimental confirmation in whole ecosystems is lacking. We quantified nitrogen transfer efficiency (a proxy for overall energy transfer) in freshwater plankton in artificial ponds exposed to 7 years of experimental warming. We provide the first direct experimental evidence that, relative to ambient conditions, 4˚C of warming can decrease trophic transfer efficiency by up to 56%. In addition, both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass were lower in the warmed ponds, indicating major shifts in energy uptake, transformation and transfer 5,6 . These new findings reconcile observed warming-driven changes in individual-level growth costs and carbon-use efficiency across diverse taxa 4,7-10 with increases in the ratio of total respiration to gross primary production at the ecosystem level 11-13 . Our results imply that an increasing proportion of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis will be lost to the atmosphere as the planet warms, impairing energy flux through food chains, with negative implications for larger consumers and the functioning of entire ecosystems.In natural ecosystems, the efficiency of energy transfer from resources to consumers determines the biomass structure of food webs.

        <p>Energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels has been recognised as a key determinant of how biomass is distributed in ecosystems for more than a century [1][2][3][14][15][16][17] . More efficient energy transfer across short food chains can lead to higher standing biomass of upper trophic levels: for example, inverted biomass pyramids are often seen in aquatic food webs 18,19 , where consumer stocks outweigh those of the smaller producers, with much higher biomass turnover rates than their animal consumers. At the other extreme, inefficient energy transfer via long food chains can explain the relatively low biomass of apex predators in other ecosystems 16,20,21 .Energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels has been recognised as a key determinant of how biomass is distributed in ecosystems for more than a century [1][2][3][14][15][16][17] .

        <p>We established an outdoor, still-water mesocosm experiment in 2005 17 to address this gap, using twenty 1 m 3 artificial ponds, half of which have been warmed by 4˚C (e.g. in line with IPCC Scenario A1B 26 ) above ambient temperature since September 2006 (Extended Data Fig. 1). These ponds have been open to natural dispersal and colonisation from the regional species pool for hundreds of generations and have well-established, diverse communities 27 , allowing us to explore how warming alters ecological and evolutionary dynamics in whole ecosystems. In 2013, after 7 years of warming, we carried out a 15 N isotope tracer experiment 28 to track how long-term warming had altered the trophic transfer efficiency between phytoplankton and their zooplankton consumers.We established an outdoor, still-water mesocosm experiment in 2005 17 to address this gap, using twenty 1 m 3 artificial ponds, half of which have been warmed by 4˚C (e.g. in line with IPCC Scenario A1B 26 ) above ambient temperature since September 2006 (Extended Data Fig. 1).

        <p>On the 16 th July 2013, we added a trace amount (980 µmol) of K 15 NO 3 -hereafter the 15 Ntracer-to sixteen ponds over the course of 24 hours (Extended Data Fig. 1). The experiment was designed to trace the natural incorporation of nitrogen over time, but without perturbing the system by inducing a phytoplankton bloom due to an artificial fertilisation effect. The addition of the 15 N-tracer had no detectable influence on the concentration of total dissolved inorganic nitrogen, nor did it affect the daytime CO 2 influx to the ponds through net primary production (see Methods, Extended Data Figs. 2,3, Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figs.

We adapted a one-compartment, first-order absorption model previously employed to model isotope incorporation in insects 29 . Here, the dynamics of the tracer (i.e. incorporation up to the peak and decay after the peak) results from the balance between an absorption, κ a , and an elimination, κ e , rate (d -1 ).

        <p>We obtained posterior distributions of treatment-specific mean efficiencies of nitrogen transfer, ε, based on the treatment-specific Bayesian posterior distributions of κ a , κ e , and ϕ . ε ranged from 10-40% on average across treatments and groups (Fig. 2d), consistent with previous estimates from natural systems 2,3 . From the posterior draws of treatment-specific ε, we also obtained a distribution of the percentage decline in ε between ambient and warmed ponds, which was substantially reduced in the warmed ponds for both the phytoplankton (median decline = 56.4%; upper 95% C.I. = 27.5-87.8%) and zooplankton (38.1%; upper 95% C.I. = 3.6-81.3%) communities (Fig. 2d; Extended Data Fig. 6).

        <p>Our findings show that the structure and functioning of the ecosystems that have emerged after 7 years of experimental warming are characterised by markedly lower trophic transfer efficiency compared with those that have assembled under ambient temperature regimes. A wide range of interrelated and non-mutually exclusive physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms could provide causative explanations for these results, but such fine-grained processes cannot be disentangled in a field experiment with freely assembling ecosystems of the scale and complexity as presented in this study. Nevertheless, a number of lines of evidence provide important clues. For example, we have consistently observed that warming has shifted the phytoplankton communities towards larger species 17,27,36 (Supplementary Fig. S8) that are also potentially less palatable to zooplankton consumers. Such a shift in the edibility of the phytoplankton communities could at least partially explain the lower trophic transfer efficiency in the warmed ecosystems. In contrast, the metabolic balance quantifies the overall energy balance between photosynthesis (carbon fixation) and respiration (carbon remineralisation) at the ecosystem scale and throughout this long-term experiment we have observed that warming has increased the ratio of ecosystem respiration (ER) to gross primary production (GPP) 13,26 (see Supplementary Fig. S9). These results emphasise that despite shifts in taxonomic composition, the fundamental effect of warming in altering the carbon metabolism and energy balance of these ecosystems has remained consistent. Thus, whilst the structural elements of the ecosystems may have undergone reorganisation over time either via ecological change of the constituent taxa 17,27 or via evolutionary adaptation 37 , the thermodynamic impacts of warming on energy metabolism seem to ultimately constrain the effects of rising temperatures on ecosystem functioning. The findings in the present manuscript-that warming has decreased the efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels-appears to encapsulate yet another manifestation of the way in which warming has radically altered the metabolism and energy flows in these ecosystems. Together this body of evidence suggests that rising temperatures alter metabolism at the organism level which, in turn, reduces the amount of energy that can be transferred from one trophic level to the next. Ultimately this means that more of the carbon fixed by photosynthesis is respired and lost to the atmosphere as heat and CO 2 with less being retained in the ecosystem. If these findings are generally applicable-and there is good reason to believe they could be 22,23,25,38 -climate warming could cause major changes to the flux of energy and declines in the biomass of toppredators in the aquatic realm, which may impair the critical services that aquatic ecosystems deliver to society, including the provision of food from commercial fisheries.Our findings show that the structure and functioning of the ecosystems that have emerged after 7 years of experimental warming are characterised by markedly lower trophic transfer efficiency compared with those that have assembled under ambient temperature regimes.

        <p>The warming treatment has been continuously maintained until the present (May 2020). We categorise the duration of the experiment as "long-term" because it encompasses enough time for ecological, evolutionary and ecosystem successional dynamics to play out. Seven years (the duration of the experiment at the time of the tracer additions) encompasses many hundreds to thousands of generations for the planktonic organisms studied here. This means that the emergent outcomes we are measuring in these systems encompass both the immediate physiological impacts of warming, as well as the changes due to local extinctions and colonisation dynamics (ecological turnover) and genetic changes in the constituent taxa as they adapt (evolutionary dynamics) to the new environmental conditions imposed by the experimental treatments 17,27,36,37 .The warming treatment has been continuously maintained until the present (May 2020).

        <p>We used a 15 N-tracer to quantify material transfer between trophic levels in the plankton food web, assuming that our measurements of the efficiency of nitrogen transfer also reflect carbon and energy transfer between trophic levels. To verify this assumption, we first tested whether there were any within-pond temporal changes in C:N ratio in the ambient and warmed ponds by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical linear model to each group (phytoplankton and zooplankton). If over the duration of the 54 day experiment, which encompassed several turnovers in the shortlived phyto-and zooplankton communities, the C:N ratio remained constant while nitrogen was being assimilated, then we can conclude that carbon was being assimilated proportionately. We included a fixed-effect interaction between time (continuous: day) and treatment (categorical: ambient vs. warmed), and a pond-level random effect to account for repeated measures throughout the experiment. C:N ratios were calculated based on moles of carbon and nitrogen in each sample on each day. A time slope, β t , that is indistinguishable from 0 would be considered as evidence of no change in C:N ratio over the 15 N-tracer experiment, and our results support this assumption: C:N ratio did not change over time for both phytoplankton (β t for ambient treatment: -0.02; Bayesian 95% C.I. = -0.08-0.03; β t for warmed treatment: -0.03; 95% C.I.We used a 15 N-tracer to quantify material transfer between trophic levels in the plankton food web, assuming that our measurements of the efficiency of nitrogen transfer also reflect carbon and energy transfer between trophic levels.

        <p>We then tested whether there was a decline in plankton carbon biomass between ambient and warmed treatments (Fig. 3 in the main text) that would be consistent with a decline in the efficiency of energy transfer, by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical linear model to the biomass estimates for each group. We included treatment (ambient vs. warmed) as a fixed effect, and pond as a random effect to account for repeated measures throughout the experiment. Biomass data were normalised by applying a natural-logarithm transformation. One of the samples presented an unusually high carbon biomass of phytoplankton (10-fold higher than the mean; Fig. 3) and was therefore removed from the analysis. We used the posterior distribution of estimated parameters, β w (mean carbon biomass from warmed treatments) and β a (mean carbon biomass from ambi- ent treatments), to calculate a posterior distribution of between-treatment percentage decline for both groups: (1 -(β w / β a )) × 100. These distributions were overlaid on the percentage-decline posterior distributions obtained for the efficiency of nitrogen transfer described in the main text.We then tested whether there was a decline in plankton carbon biomass between ambient and warmed treatments (Fig. 3 in the main text) that would be consistent with a decline in the efficiency of energy transfer, by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical linear model to the biomass estimates for each group.

        <p>We tested whether other physico-chemical properties besides temperature could be affecting the variability in the tracer incorporation dynamics. To do so, we first calculated the mean posterior observation-level residuals from our main model for each taxonomic group (i.e. phytoplankton and zooplankton; Fig. 1; Extended Data Fig. 5; Extended Data Table 1). Then, for each group separately, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical model to investigate the relationship between the residuals from the original model and the dissolved inorganic nitrogen species (DIN = NO - 2 , NO - 3 , NH + 4 ) in the ponds. The model accounted for the repeated measurements at the pond level as hierarchical effects both on the intercept and slopes of DIN species. The model was fitted using the

Priors were uninformative (brms default), and fitting specifications (number of chains, warm-up period) and convergence criterion are the same as described above for equation 1. Results indicate that the DIN species could not explain any systematic variation in our main model residuals (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Figs. S11-13). That is, the main statistical analysis in our manuscript identifies a strong, main effect of temperature that is not improved by adding the effect of inorganic nutrients.
