        <p>We present a catalog of 536 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Project between 400 and 800 MHz from 2018 July 25 to 2019 July 1, including 62 bursts from 18 previously reported repeating sources. The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth.

        <p>Although the first fast radio burst (FRB) was discovered nearly a decade and a half ago (Lorimer et al. 2007), the nature of these sources remains a mystery. Now securely determined to originate from external galaxies, generally from cosmological distances (e.g., Tendulkar et al. 2017;Macquart et al. 2020), FRBs inhabit a unique and extreme portion of radio luminosity/ timescale phase space (e.g., Cordes &amp; Chatterjee 2019) compared to other radio transients and hence are of great interest. Moreover, all-sky rates of ∼10 3 day -1 (Bhandari et al. 2018) indicate that the phenomenon is ubiquitous. The mystery of FRBs therefore signals a common cosmic phenomenon borne from extreme, unknown environments.Although the first fast radio burst (FRB) was discovered nearly a decade and a half ago (Lorimer et al. 2007), the nature of these sources remains a mystery.

        <p>One major clue regarding the nature of FRBs is that some repeat (Spitler et al. 2016), with periodic activity observed in two sources (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a; Rajwade et al. 2020). Repetition rules out cataclysmic models for at least the repeating FRB sources, though it remains unclear whether all FRBs are repeating sources that come with vastly different waiting times between repetitions (Ravi 2019; James et al. 2020). Evidence for distinct emission phenomena has come from repeat bursts being wider than those from apparent nonrepeaters (Scholz et al. 2016;CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a;Fonseca et al. 2020). Additionally, the two localized repeating FRBs whose hosts have measured properties (Chatterjee et al. 2017;Marcote et al. 2020) are in late-type galaxies that have star formation, whereas localizations of apparent nonrepeaters indicate that the latter sources can sometimes reside in galaxies with modest or little star formation (Bhandari et al. 2020). To date, one Galactic magnetar has shown both repeated X-ray bursts and a radio burst of luminosity close to the FRB range (Bochenek et al. 2020;CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b). This suggests that repeaters may be young, active magnetars, a scenario consistent with localizations of repeating FRBs to star-forming locations (Chatterjee et al. 2017;Marcote et al. 2020). Volumetric rate comparisons between FRBs and giant magnetar flares have been used to support the magnetar scenario (e.g., CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b); however, uncertainties in current rate estimates are large, being dominated by either small number statistics or systematics from including multiple different surveys having distinct biases. Detailed studies of a larger sample of FRBs from a single survey, repeating or not, are clearly of great value.One major clue regarding the nature of FRBs is that some repeat (Spitler et al. 2016), with periodic activity observed in two sources (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a; Rajwade et al. 2020).

        <p>A detailed study of large numbers of FRBs, in a single homogeneous survey with a well-measured instrument selection function, is desirable for many additional reasons. A wide-field survey of many FRBs could be used to probe large-scale structure through spatial correlations (Masui &amp; Sigurdson 2015), or combined with galaxy surveys to search for correlations and variations with redshift (e.g., Rafiei-Ravandi et al. 2020).A detailed study of large numbers of FRBs, in a single homogeneous survey with a well-measured instrument selection function, is desirable for many additional reasons.

        <p>Furthermore, the FRB sky distribution can be correlated with Galactic direction to investigate claims of Galactic plane avoidance (Burke-Spolaor &amp; Bannister 2014; Petroff et al. 2014;Keane &amp; Petroff 2015). Large FRB samples in different frequency ranges can help elucidate the population's average spectrum (e.g., Karastergiou et al. 2015;Chawla et al. 2017) or effects of FRB radio wave propagation in local environments (Cordes et al. 2017). Moreover, a large sample of FRBs can be used to determine the population's energy distribution function (Vedantham et al. 2016;Lawrence et al. 2017;James et al. 2019;Hashimoto et al. 2020;James et al. 2021aJames et al. , 2021b)), which contains evidence of the redshift distribution of FRB sources, as well as their detectability as a function of survey sensitivity for a given telescope. Analyses of dispersion measure (DM) distributions, especially comparing repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, can reveal different source class locations and environments, as could searches for differences in scattering times or bandwidths. Additionally, correlations among parameters can be investigated with a large enough sample; for example, a DM-scattering correlation could signal either that the local environment contributes to both measures (Qiu et al. 2020) or that galaxy halos along the line of sight cause radio wave scattering (Vedantham &amp; Phinney 2019). Alternatively, a width-DM correlation is expected owing to Hubble expansion if DM is indeed a faithful proxy for cosmic distance as recent studies suggest (Macquart et al. 2020). However, all previous and current surveys have limited fields of view, sensitivity, survey durations, and/or processing capabilities, rendering them incapable of detecting sufficiently large numbers of FRBs to address many or all of the above possibilities. Past efforts have required the combination of the results from several individual surveys to boost statistical power, but these surveys have different and largely undetermined instrumental transfer functions, which result in strong biases in their data sets (Connor 2019). The detection of a large number of events with a single instrument, for which a well-defined selection function can be robustly determined, can therefore enable significant progress in the field.Furthermore, the FRB sky distribution can be correlated with Galactic direction to investigate claims of Galactic plane avoidance (Burke-Spolaor &amp; Bannister 2014; Petroff et al. 2014;Keane &amp; Petroff 2015).

        <p>The CHIME/FRB Project (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018) uses the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) to detect FRBs in the 400-800 MHz band. CHIME's large collecting area and wide field of view make it an excellent FRB detector. Indeed, during a few initial weeks of pre-commissioning, CHIME/FRB detected over a dozen new FRBs, demonstrating that the phenomenon exists down to 400 MHz, the lowest known frequency at that time (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019b). CHIME/FRB also detected the second known source to emit repeat bursts (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019c). Since then, CHIME/FRB has discovered an additional 17 repeaters (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a;Fonseca et al. 2020), as well as one that repeats regularly (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020a). These repeating sources, published rapidly to allow the community to assist with localization efforts (e.g., Marcote et al. 2020), are part of a larger number of FRBs detected by CHIME/FRB during its first year of operation. Here we present the first FRB Catalog released by CHIME/FRB, hereafter referred to as "Catalog 1." We include 536 bursts detected between 2018 July 25 and 2019 July 1, including all bursts from repeating sources previously published in other works.

        <p>This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the observing parameters, including a brief synopsis of the instrument, pipeline, and overall methodologies used, as well as our sky exposure, sensitivity thresholds, and our determination of instrumental biases. In Section 3, we describe the contents of our catalog and how they were determined, including burst localizations and properties, along with relevant tables and figures. Section 4 describes our method for injecting synthetic signals into our detection pipeline for calibrating selection biases. In Section 5, we compare parameter distributions for repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, in order to identify differences between these types of sources. In Section 6, we show parameter distributions corrected for instrumental biases and deduce cosmic distributions for many key FRB parameters, including the FRB fluence distribution. In Section 7 we discuss these results in the context of other FRB findings in the literature and briefly describe contemporaneous analyses of these same data that are presented in accompanying papers. We present our conclusions in Section 8.This paper is organized as follows.

        <p>The CHIME telescope, its FRB detection instrument, and its real-time pipeline have been described in detail elsewhere (see Table 1; CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018). Briefly, the telescope is located on the grounds of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) near Penticton, British Columbia, Canada, and consists of four 20 × 100 m cylindrical paraboloid reflectors oriented N-S, with each cylinder axis populated by 256 equispaced dual-linear-polarization antennas sensitive in the frequency range 400-800 MHz. CHIME has no moving parts. The CHIME/FRB detector views the entire sky north of decl. -11°(a configurable choice; see below) every day as it transits overhead. Sources northward of decl. +70°are visible twice per day, on opposite sides of the north celestial pole. The 2048 antenna signals are amplified, conditioned, digitized, and split into 1024 frequency channels at 2.56 μs time resolution by the portion of CHIME's correlator called the "F-Engine," which uses 128 custom-built field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based "ICE" motherboards (Bandura et al. 2016) housed in two radio frequency interference (RFI) shielded shipping containers located under the reflectors. The signals are then sent to the "X-engine," which consists of 256 liquid-cooled GPU-based compute nodes located in two custom RFI-shielded shipping containers located adjacent to the reflectors. Within the X-engine, the spatial correlation is performed and polarizations are summed, forming 1024 independent total-intensity sky beams along the N-S primary beam (256 N-S × 4 E-W; Ng et al. 2017), as well as upchannelization to the 16k frequency channels at 0.983 ms time resolution used in the real-time FRB search. Formed beams are spaced evenly in q sin N-S from θ = -60°to θ = +60°, where θ is the angle from zenith along the meridian.

        <p>Each beam's data are searched in real time for FRBs using a custom-developed triggering software pipeline consisting of four stages termed L0, L1, L2/L3, and L4 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018). Briefly, L0 is effectively the spatial correlation, beamforming, and up-channelization stage described above. L1 is the primary search workhorse, with initial cleaning of RFI (of either anthropogenic or solar origin), followed by a highly optimized tree-style dedispersion, spectral-weighting, and peak-search algorithm (called "bonsai"). L1 is executed on a dedicated cluster of 128 CPU-based nodes located in a third, custom-built shipping container adjacent to the telescope. L1 nodes are constantly buffering intensity data, which can be saved upon detection of a candidate FRB event. L2/L3 combines results from all beams and groups detections to identify likely unique events, as well as further reject RFI, identify known sources, and verify a source's extragalactic nature via its DM combined with the NE2001 (Cordes &amp; Lazio 2002) and YMW16 (Yao et al. 2017) models of the maximum Milky Way DM. Metadata headers (containing detection beam locations, initial DM, pulse width, and signal-strength estimates) for FRB candidates are stored in the L4 database, and raw intensity data buffered by L1 are saved to disk for off-line analysis.Each beam's data are searched in real time for FRBs using a custom-developed triggering software pipeline consisting of four stages termed L0, L1, L2/L3, and L4 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018).

        <p>A significant change to the pipeline as described in CHIME/ FRB Collaboration et al. (2018) was made to the event classification in L2/L3 in 2019 February, where a high signalto-noise ratio (S/N) classification bypass was added in response to a number of very high S/N events being misclassified as RFI. After the change, any event with S/N &gt; 100 bypasses automatic classification and proceeds directly to human classification.A significant change to the pipeline as described in CHIME/ FRB Collaboration et al.

A description of the baseband portion of the CHIME/FRB instrument, as well as its analysis pipeline, is presented elsewhere (Mckinven et al. 2021;Michilli et al. 2021), and the analysis and results of the baseband data for the 153 events in Catalog 1 for which they were captured will be presented in a future work.Note that as of 2018 December the CHIME/FRB real-time pipeline also triggers the recording of raw telescope baseband from CHIME's 1024 antennas (which is buffered in memory ∼34 s on the X-engine) upon detection of a bright FRB candidate.

        <p>Throughout our analysis, including when evaluating the exposure and sensitivity and when injecting synthetic events, we rely on a model of the CHIME/FRB's beam, including the primary beam of an individual antenna element, and the interferometric synthesized beams formed digitally in the X-engine.Throughout our analysis, including when evaluating the exposure and sensitivity and when injecting synthetic events, we rely on a model of the CHIME/FRB's beam, including the primary beam of an individual antenna element, and the interferometric synthesized beams formed digitally in the X-engine.</p>
        <p>The CHIME primary beam, owing to its N-S-oriented cylindrical reflectors, is narrow in the E-W direction and wide in the N-S direction. The primary beam is the response of a single feed over the cylinder, modulated by reflections off the ground plane and interactions between neighboring feeds. These interactions impart characteristic spatial and spectral features to the primary beam.The CHIME primary beam, owing to its N-S-oriented cylindrical reflectors, is narrow in the E-W direction and wide in the N-S direction.

        <p>A preliminary model is used for the primary beam in the analyses presented here, constructed from an outer product of independent estimates of the E-W and N-S profiles of the beam. We term this our v0 beam model, which will be described in detail in future work. Reduced dimensionality representations of the beam are shown in Figures 2 and3. In brief, we define the beam model in telescope coordinates x and y, which are two Cartesian coordinate components of sky locations on the unit sphere, where the z-axis lies at the telescope zenith and the y-axis points to the horizon in the direction of local celestial north. The E-W (x) profile is measured by tracking Taurus A with the 26 m John A. Galt Telescope at DRAO, equipped with a CHIME feed, as the source transits across the CHIME primary beam, while correlating the 26 m signal with the signal from each of the 1024 CHIME feeds (see Berger et al. 2016). This yields a high-S/N measurement of the E-W profile along the source track. Since the Galt telescope uses an equatorial mount, the polarization angle of the source can be kept fixed with respect to its feed. The profile used for the beam model in this work is an average of multiple observations of Taurus A, translated across all declinations, and stacked over all CHIME feeds separately for each polarization and frequency.A preliminary model is used for the primary beam in the analyses presented here, constructed from an outer product of independent estimates of the E-W and N-S profiles of the beam.

The profile used for the beam model in this work is an average of multiple observations of Taurus A, translated across all declinations, and stacked over all CHIME feeds separately for each polarization and frequency.</p>
        <p>The N-S (y) profile provides the normalization to the peak beam response at each declination. This profile is estimated via a model that has been developed to describe the cross talk between feeds on the focal line, referred to as the coupling response. Cross talk can occur through several paths, e.g., radiation broadcast by a feed being directly picked up by nearby feeds (direct path), or radiation being reflected by the cylinder and reaching other feeds (one-bounce path). Each of these coupling paths introduces a delayed copy of the broadcast radiation, and a superposition of multiple such copies gives rise to the coupling response. This model has a number of free parameters associated with the coupling strength for each path as a function of spectral frequency. We fit these parameters using observations of 37 bright radio point sources at different declinations. This provides an estimate of the N-S profile spanning all declinations and frequencies. By internal convention, the primary beam model is scaled such that Cygnus A (our most reliable calibrator) has unit response (1 Jy/Jy) at each spectral frequency when transiting the meridian. While we have not accounted for variability in these point sources, we have checked that consistent results are obtained using data collected 6 months apart.The N-S (y) profile provides the normalization to the peak beam response at each declination.

        <p>The power responses for the two-antenna polarization are averaged, meaning that our beam model applies best to unpolarized sources. While FRBs are typically strongly polarized, they also typically have significant Faraday rotation, which rotates the polarization angle several times over the band. As such, we expect the unpolarized beam response to be reasonably applicable when averaged over the band.The power responses for the two-antenna polarization are averaged, meaning that our beam model applies best to unpolarized sources.

        <p>To validate this primary beam model, we use CHIME's intensity mapping data stream to observe the Sun, which allows a range of declinations to be measured with a single source. We employ baselines shorter than 10 m while beamforming to avoid resolving out the Sun. The primary beam measurements were carried out over 2019-2020, which is a known period of solar minimum. Over this span, the daily flux variability of the Sun is recorded to be 10% in the CHIME frequency band (D. Wulf et al. 2021, in preparation). The comparisons are shown in Figure 3. In the region probed, we find 10% agreement between the measurements and our model for the primary beam. The low decl. of the Sun compared to the CHIME latitude means that we probe relatively low elevations, where the beam model is constrained by few point-source observations. As such, we consider this comparison to be the most pessimistic case for the beam model performance.To validate this primary beam model, we use CHIME's intensity mapping data stream to observe the Sun, which allows a range of declinations to be measured with a single source.

        <p>The response of the FFT synthesized beams is precisely known, as they are synthesized digitally (Ng et al. 2017). We have measured the antenna-to-antenna phase variations from either calibration errors or the primary beams to be at or below the 0.01 rad level. Phase variations at this level have been shown to be negligible (Masui et al. 2019). Antenna-to-antenna amplitude variations are dominated by variations in the primary beam and exist at the 10% level. These are expected to induce percent-level perturbations to the synthesized beam. Observations of bright sources such as Cygnus A and Taurus A using the CHIME/FRB back end have been used to evaluate the composite beam model, and in particular the FFT synthesized beams since the primary beam is well characterized at these declinations. These observations match expectations at the few percent level, implying that our overall uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the antenna-mean primary beam.The response of the FFT synthesized beams is precisely known, as they are synthesized digitally (Ng et al. 2017).

        <p>CHIME is an N-S-oriented transit telescope with cylindrical reflectors that yield a long ∼120°N-S primary beam on the sky. The telescope operates nominally 24 hr per day. As such, CHIME/FRB's exposure to the sky is effectively uniform in R.A., but not in decl. Additionally, during the survey period, CHIME was not fully operational 100% of the time; there were occasional shut-offs for maintenance or software upgrades, or for unexpected occurrences like sudden power outages. Even when operational, the nature of CHIME's infrastructure means that portions may be off-line. For example, a temporarily nonfunctional GPU node in the X-engine results in a portion of the bandwidth (1 part in 256, or 64 out of 16,384 channels) being unavailable. A temporarily nonfunctional CPU node in the FRB cluster results in eight sky beams not being processed. To quantify the exposure and sensitivity of the telescope to FRBs, these effects must be accounted for. Metrics of all computing systems relevant to CHIME/FRB are recorded for this purpose. Metrics for the L1 nodes are recorded whenever an event (astrophysical or RFI) is detected by the real-time pipeline. Maximum temporal separation between events, and thus L1 metrics, when the real-time pipeline is functioning nominally, is of the order of a few minutes. Monitoring of the L2/L3 and L4 stages was manual, with the system being checked every few hours. The exposure on the sky for each detected FRB presented here can thus be determined, as can the exposure for any position on the sky.CHIME is an N-S-oriented transit telescope with cylindrical reflectors that yield a long ∼120°N-S primary beam on the sky.

        <p>For the purpose of computing exposure, we consider a sky location as being detectable if it is within the FWHM region of a synthesized beam at 600 MHz and the CPU node designated for processing data for that beam is operational. We evaluate the exposure for daily transits of all sky locations with decl. δ &gt; -11°by querying the recorded system metrics. We exclude transits observed in the pre-commissioning period (2018 July 25-August 27), as the telescope was operating with a different beam configuration, resulting in the sensitivity to a given sky location being significantly different from that for the current configuration. Additionally, we excise transits during which the system was not operating at nominal sensitivity.For the purpose of computing exposure, we consider a sky location as being detectable if it is within the FWHM region of a synthesized beam at 600 MHz and the CPU node designated for processing data for that beam is operational.

        <p>System sensitivity variations arise owing to changes in gain calibration and RFI environment and are characterized by analyzing distributions of S/N values for CHIME/FRB detections of Galactic radio pulsars, as described in detail by Josephy et al. (2019) and Fonseca et al. (2020). A transit is excised if it occurs on a sidereal day for which the rms noise derived from pulsar detections exceeds the mean rms noise in the period used for the exposure calculation by more than 1σ. On average, 7% of all transits were excised for each sky location. This is lower than the expected excision fraction for a one-sided 1σ cut (16%), as the distribution of daily rms noise values is not perfectly Gaussian. A total of 23 FRB events from excised periods are not included in population distributions and analyses, as their selection function and rate statistics cannot be well characterized.System sensitivity variations arise owing to changes in gain calibration and RFI environment and are characterized by analyzing distributions of S/N values for CHIME/FRB detections of Galactic radio pulsars, as described in detail by Josephy et al.

We do not combine the exposure for both transits, as the primary and synthesized beam response varies significantly between the two. The aforementioned sky map is then used to compute the exposure for all detected FRBs. For each source, we calculate the weighted average and standard deviation of the exposure over a uniform grid of positions within its 90% confidence localization region with the weights equal to the sky-position probability maps (see Section 3.2). The exposures for all sources with the corresponding uncertainties are provided in Catalog 1 and shown in Figure 5.An all-sky map of the total exposure is shown in Figure 4, with the circumpolar sky locations (δ &gt; 70°) having the two transits, upper and lower, plotted separately.

        <p>We follow the fluence threshold methods detailed by Josephy et al. (2019) and CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2019a). To estimate a sensitivity threshold across the quoted exposure, we account for three sources of sensitivity variation by generating a large number of detection scenarios in a Monte Carlo simulation. Day-to-day variation is captured with detections of known pulsars, variation as the source transits through the formed beams is computed using the beam model, and spectral sensitivity variation is estimated by combining simulated spectral profiles with the bandpass, which is obtained for each burst during the fluence measurement process, where steadysource transits provide a mapping between beamformer units and janskys.

For this reason, we used the called-back, total-intensity data saved from our L1 buffers to determine an improved DM via maximization of the S/N of the burst using off-line algorithms that also provide a determination of burst time of arrival (t arr ) prior to downstream model fitting. However, even the S/N-optimizing DM can be significantly biased owing to chromatic pulse broadening (DM smearing and scattering) or chromatic complex burst morphology.The initial determination of DM provided by bonsai in the L1 real-time detection pipeline is only approximate owing to the limited resolution with which it is reported (see CHIME/ FRB Collaboration et al. 2018).

A second model was generated assuming zero scattering, in which case the function T(DM, t arr,i , w i , τ = 0) in Equation (2) is replaced with a Gaussian function of standard deviation w i that reflects the full temporal width of profile component i. The χ 2 values for both models were then compared through an Ftest for model selection, and a p-value threshold of 0.1% was used to declare the significance of τ. In cases where scattering is not significant, we quote an upper limit on τ of 2 × w. In cases where the fit of the width-scattering model is highly degenerate (i.e., when the covariance matrix after least-squares optimization is singular), we default to the no-scattering model as the superior description. Simulations have shown that CHIME/FRB total-intensity data can be used to robustly measure values of w and τ larger than 100 μs only; for cases where the fitted value is smaller than this, we quote 100 μs as an upper limit.We generated two models with fitburst for each CHIME/ FRB event and compared best-fit statistics in order to determine the significance of multipath scattering in spectra.

        <p>In Catalog 1, our ability to determine burst fluences is limited by the uncertainty of our burst localization combined with CHIME's complex and rapidly varying beam pattern. In particular, the spectral structure of the beam pattern and overall beam response can change significantly over the extent of the header localization region obtained for each burst, making it difficult to reliably correct fluence measurements for beam attenuation. Localization uncertainty, and to a lesser extent beam model uncertainty, introduces an unknown primary beam response that is a strong function of a burst's uncertain hour angle (see Figure 6). As such, we assume that each burst was detected along the meridian of the primary beam (at the peak )), spans 1°in decl., and is centered at the beam with the strongest detection. Localization is performed as a grid-search χ 2 minimization, where confidence intervals are obtained from contours of constant Δχ 2 . The color scale encodes these intervals, such that the area enclosed by a given color defines the corresponding confidence interval. The 68% and 95% intervals are shown with solid and dashed contours, respectively. Note that the common three-region pattern reflects the chromatically smeared sidelobes of the formed beams.

        <p>Transit observations of steady sources with known spectral properties are used to sample the conversion from CHIME/ FRB beamformer units to janskys as a function of frequency across the primary beam. We pair each burst with the calibration spectrum of the nearest steady-source transit, closest first in decl., then in time. We assume N-S beam symmetry, so that sources on both sides of zenith can be used for each event. By applying the calibration spectrum to the total-intensity data for each burst, we derive a dynamic spectrum in physical units roughly corrected for N-S primary beam variations. The fluence is then derived by integrating the burst extent in the band-averaged time series, while the peak flux is the maximum value within the burst extent (at 0.98304 ms resolution).Transit observations of steady sources with known spectral properties are used to sample the conversion from CHIME/ FRB beamformer units to janskys as a function of frequency across the primary beam.

        <p>The error due to differences in the primary beam between the calibrator and the assumed FRB location along the meridian is estimated by using steady sources from a single day to calibrate each other and measuring the average fractional error compared to known flux values. This contributes a relative error on the order of 20% to the flux measurements. The error due to temporal variation in the calculated beamformer unit to jansky conversion spectra is determined by measuring the rms variation over a period of roughly 2 weeks surrounding the burst arrival. This also captures uncertainty due to calibrator source variability on that timescale and contributes a relative error on the order of 13% to the flux measurements, depending on the calibrator used. These two errors are also combined with the rms of the off-pulse in the band-averaged time series to form the overall errors presented in Catalog 1.

        <p>As for any astrophysical instrument, 
            <rs type="software">CHIME</rs>/FRB has a transfer function, introduces selection biases, and adds noise due to both the nature of the telescope and the software detection pipeline. These instrument characteristics need to be carefully characterized so that they can be accounted for in any population analysis of FRB events and their distributions, as is performed in Section 6 below. We account for these biases through careful measurements of the telescope beam, calibration, and noise properties and by probing the selection function using Monte Carlo techniques with synthetic events injected into the 
            <rs type="software">CHIME</rs>/FRB software system. This strategy mimics the Monte Carlo event generator techniques used in particle physics, with the exception that real-time telescope noise and the RFI environment are incorporated by injecting the events in situ while the telescope is operating. The Monte Carlo injection system was designed to allow synthetic FRBs to be injected into the real-time pipeline with user-defined properties. Injected pulses (hereafter "injections") are suitably flagged to ensure that none are mistaken as genuine astrophysical signals.

        <p>Here we describe how we generate a population of FRBs for injecting into the CHIME/FRB real-time detection pipeline using the system described in Section 4. We start by sampling locations in the sky where we will evaluate our beam model and place simulated FRBs. We randomly sample 10 6 locations uniformly distributed on the celestial sphere in telescope coordinates. Of these, we discard all locations that are below the horizon, for which the band-averaged primary beam response is less than 10 -2 in beam model units (see Section 2.1), and for which the band-averaged response does not reach 10 -3 in any of the 1024 synthesized beams. As such, we are not injecting bursts into the far sidelobes; however, this does not incur a bias since such events are cut from the catalog for population inferences. The fraction of sky locations surviving these cuts is f sky = 0.0277. Note that this "forwardmodeling" method of accounting for the telescope's beam response is distinct from the simpler analyses done in other rate estimations; it is important in our case because of the complex CHIME beam.Here we describe how we generate a population of FRBs for injecting into the CHIME/FRB real-time detection pipeline using the system described in Section 4.

The FRB properties in these distributions are uncorrelated except for γ and r. These distributions are described in more detail in Section 6 and Appendix C. After drawing from the initial distributions, we perform a cut of events that have little chance of being detected based on the FRB properties, our beam model, and a conservative noise model. This left 96,942 events scheduled for injection. Due to overlapping sensitivity, true FRBs can be detected in multiple beams simultaneously.

The injection system does not currently support multibeam injections; instead, we inject a given event into the beam with the highest predicted S/N based on the noise and beam model.</p>
        <p>One of the 128 L1 nodes has been outfitted as a "receiver node" (L1′) for the purposes of injections. L1′ receives a stream of duplicated data for four N-S adjacent intensity beams. These data are processed using the same software as the rest of the L1 nodes. Synthetic pulses are injected into the duplicated data through an interfacing server. This server manages beam duplication and is capable of selecting which set of four beams are being streamed to L1′ in the live system. Careful flagging of injected events in the duplicated data streams ensures that none of the injected signals are misclassified as true astrophysical events.One of the 128 L1 nodes has been outfitted as a "receiver node" (L1′) for the purposes of injections.

        <p>The injection system injects FRB signals using user-defined parameters. The FRBs to be injected are grouped by the beams in which they are expected to have the highest S/N based on the beam model. A module known as the injection driver chooses a set of four consecutive beams at random from the 1024 CHIME/FRB intensity beams and requests the injection server to start the duplication of these four beams to the L1′ receiver node. The injection system then waits for 300 s for the running estimates of the noise properties used in L1 to achieve steady state. The injection signals prescribed for these beams are generated and injected with a minimum interval of 1 s. However, the typical interval is 2-3 s, the actual time required to generate and inject an FRB.The injection system injects FRB signals using user-defined parameters.

        <p>Every injection successfully injected into the data stream without software failure is noted in a database, and a unique ID is generated. An "injection snatching" module in the L2/L3 pipeline is provided with a list of "active" injections that are expected in the near future, along with their unique IDs, expected DM, expected arrival time, and beam number. An FRB trigger that is detected at the same time and DM (within a threshold based on the size of the bonsai DM bins) and from the same beam number is marked as an identified injection, and the detection parameters are reported to the injection database tagged with the unique ID.Every injection successfully injected into the data stream without software failure is noted in a database, and a unique ID is generated.

        <p>Of the 96,942 events scheduled for injection, we were able to inject 84,697 for an injection efficiency of ò inj = 0.874. Failures to inject events were due to system errors and affect an essentially random subset of injections. We injected into the predicted maximum-S/N beam during a campaign in 2020 August. Of these, 39,638 events were detected and assigned a bonsai S/N. The sensitivity of the telescope during the injection campaign in 2020 August is not perfectly representative of the sensitivity during the catalog period 1-2 yr earlier. Based on the detection S/Ns of pulsars (tabulated daily), we estimate that our noise levels have improved by 6% since the beginning of the survey and 3% since the midpoint of the survey period. These changes are accounted for in our population analysis and systematic error budget as described in Appendix D. Furthermore, several periods of low sensitivity or differing instrument configurations (including the pre-commissioning period over which our first 13 bursts were discovered) are not well represented by the injection campaign. These periods, and the bursts discovered therein, are thus excised from further analyses that rely on injections. Finally, numerous tweaks to the operations of the instrument have occurred over and since the observation period. These tweaks mostly served to streamline observations and to increase the instrument uptime (for which we have a separate accounting) and have caused only small changes in our completeness. However, since our observations occurred prior to the availability of the injection system, changes in our completeness over time are difficult to quantify. Such effects should be better quantified in future data releases where injections can be performed throughout the observations.Of the 96,942 events scheduled for injection, we were able to inject 84,697 for an injection efficiency of ò inj = 0.874.

        <p>This catalog represents by far the largest number of FRBs collected in a uniform manner using a single telescope and detection pipeline. This uniformity is helpful for studying FRB property distributions, as past analyses have been complicated by using FRBs from multiple surveys having very different survey parameters (e.g., Lawrence et al. 2017).This catalog represents by far the largest number of FRBs collected in a uniform manner using a single telescope and detection pipeline.

        <p>The central challenge in studying the FRB population from our data set is compensating for selection effects (e.g., it is more difficult to measure a narrow intrinsic burst width in the presence of strong scattering) and instrument-induced biases (e.g., it is more difficult to measure narrow intrinsic burst widths due to our finite time resolution) in event reconstruction. For some FRB properties (e.g., fluence, scattering), selection effects are strong and our fractional completeness varies by orders of magnitude across the range of detected values for the property. For other properties (e.g., DM), selection effects are at the factor-of-two level.The central challenge in studying the FRB population from our data set is compensating for selection effects (e.g., it is more difficult to measure a narrow intrinsic burst width in the presence of strong scattering) and instrument-induced biases (e.g., it is more difficult to measure narrow intrinsic burst widths due to our finite time resolution) in event reconstruction.

        <p>We use two strategies for dealing with these selection effects. In this section, we compare repeater burst properties to those of apparent nonrepeaters, under the reasonable assumption that both suffer the same selection biases, subject to minor caveats discussed below. In this way we can deduce in a direct way differences in properties between the two observational classes. However, this comparative method does not permit an absolute measurement of the characteristics of either population, for example, the fluence distribution or overall sky rate. In contrast, in Section 6 we explicitly measure and compensate for selection effects using injections, but only for the total population for which we have the best statistics.We use two strategies for dealing with these selection effects.

It also reduces any dependence our results may have on the poorly understood systematic errors associated with the Galactic DM models. 3. Events detected in far sidelobes are rejected, as our primary beam is poorly understood in this regime. These far sidelobe events have visually identified "spiky" signatures in the burst spectrum (e.g., CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2020b).1.

        <p>The assumption of identical biases for nonrepeaters and repeaters is certainly untrue since we reduce our trigger threshold for the directions and DMs of previously detected FRBs, to be additionally sensitive to repeat bursts. For this reason, unless specified otherwise, we compare only the firstdetected repeater events for each repeating source, since that event's trigger threshold was at the nominal value, thereby eliminating any possible disparity and avoiding statistical complications of having multiple events per source. More subtly, the assumption of identical biases for repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, even with identical thresholds, is also likely untrue given the differences in burst widths and bandwidths shown below and described in detail by Pleunis et al. (2021) and previously reported (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019a;Fonseca et al. 2020), coupled with the fact that selection effects are correlated (as discussed in detail in Section 6). Nevertheless, in this analysis we are only sensitive to differences in the selection-induced correlations between the two subpopulations, and while we have not explored this effect in detail, we expect it to be small and unlikely to affect the conclusions of our comparison. Note that although we consider only Catalog 1 events with S/N 12, we have verified that all conclusions below hold when all catalog events, regardless of S/N, are included.The assumption of identical biases for nonrepeaters and repeaters is certainly untrue since we reduce our trigger threshold for the directions and DMs of previously detected FRBs, to be additionally sensitive to repeat bursts.

        <p>For all distribution comparisons, we report probabilities from both Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, where a p-value &lt;0.01 implies &gt;99% confidence that the two samples are drawn from different underlying distributions.For all distribution comparisons, we report probabilities from both Anderson-Darling (AD) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, where a p-value &lt;0.01 implies &gt;99% confidence that the two samples are drawn from different underlying distributions.</p>
        <p>First, we compare the sky distributions of repeaters and nonrepeaters, specifically their R.A. and decl. distributions (see Figure 10). For R.A., we find no difference in the distributions (p AD = 0.22, p K-S = 0.24), with both consistent with a uniform distribution when including bursts at all declinations. Similarly for decl., the two distributions are statistically consistent (p AD = 0.55, p K-S = 0.49). Note that the decl. distributions in Figure 10 are not corrected for exposure and sensitivity, but such corrections affect both repeaters and nonrepeaters similarly. One caveat is that near the north celestial pole, our source density is high owing to the long exposure (see Figure 4), which results in confusion that makes repeater identification more difficult than at lower declinations. Ignoring the polar region only strengthens the conclusions that the decl. distributions of repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters are statistically consistent with arising from the same sky distribution. We note that the apparent peak in the decl. distribution of nonrepeating FRBs at ∼28°is consistent within 2σ with the remainder of the distribution. Separately, we have performed detailed analyses of the sky distribution of our Catalog 1 sources. Specifically, Josephy et al. (2021) search for evidence of correlation with Galactic latitude as has been previously claimed (Burke-Spolaor &amp; Bannister 2014; Petroff et al. 2014;Macquart &amp; Johnston 2015;Bhandari et al. 2018). We also report on a search for correlation with large-scale structure in future work.First, we compare the sky distributions of repeaters and nonrepeaters, specifically their R.A. and decl. distributions (see Figure 10).

        <p>Next, we consider the observed and extragalactic DMs of apparent nonrepeaters and first-detected repeater events from Catalog 1, where extragalactic DM is defined as the observed DM minus the maximal line-of-sight component predicted by NE2001; see Figure 11. We find that the distributions are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying distribution for DM (p AD = 0.35, p K-S = 0.33) and for extragalactic DM (p AD = 0.34, p K-S = 0.24).Next, we consider the observed and extragalactic DMs of apparent nonrepeaters and first-detected repeater events from Catalog 1, where extragalactic DM is defined as the observed DM minus the maximal line-of-sight component predicted by NE2001; see Figure 11.

        <p>Next, we compare direct measures of signal strength, S/N, as measured by the initial trigger S/N from our real-time FRB search code bonsai (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018) and also by our intensity data burst code, fitburst (see Section 3.3). Note that neither of these two S/N measurements is a faithful representation of the true signal strength at the telescope aperture because of the complex, frequency-dependent CHIME beam response. Moreover, bonsai S/N is corrupted by RFI mitigation (clipping) for very bright bursts, an effect with complex behavior in time and spectral frequency. The repeater and nonrepeater samples could be differentially affected by the beam, clipping, or other effects, since the two populations have intrinsically different spectro-temporal properties (studied in detail below). Even so, the comparison is interesting since an observed difference is indicative of an intrinsic difference in the populations, even if it might be indirect through correlated observational effects. The distributions are shown in Figure 12. The repeater and apparent nonrepeater distributions are consistent with being drawn from the same population for both S/N measures (p AD = 0.65, p K-S = 0.44 for bonsai S/N and p AD = 0.08, p K-S = 0.26 for fitburst S/N).Next, we compare direct measures of signal strength, S/N, as measured by the initial trigger S/N from our real-time FRB search code bonsai (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2018) and also by our intensity data burst code, fitburst (see Section 3.3).

        <p>We can also compare signal-strength distributions using calibrated fluence and flux, noting, however, that our values have substantial uncertainties and are biased low, mainly due to the unknown location of each event within the detection beam (see Section 3.4). The distributions are shown in Figure 13. The fluence distributions are consistent with being drawn from the same underlying sample, (p AD = 0.070, p K-S = 0.066), as are the flux distributions, though with lower p-values (p AD = 0.028, p K-S = 0.068). A possible origin for this putative, slight difference is the broader widths for repeaters (see below). We note that also including Catalog 1 events with S/N 12 results in similarly low but still inconclusive p-values (p AD = 0.028, p K-S = 0.021 for fluence and p AD = 0.040, p K-S = 0.044 for flux), so it does not lend additional support to the distributions being different.We can also compare signal-strength distributions using calibrated fluence and flux, noting, however, that our values have substantial uncertainties and are biased low, mainly due to the unknown location of each event within the detection beam (see Section 3.4).

        <p>A possible fluence or flux anticorrelation with extragalactic DM is expected since more distant sources should, on average, be fainter. A simple observed anticorrelation (as we are aware is present in our data for flux vs. extragalactic DM) is insufficient to address this question owing to the significant instrumental biases (see Section 6.1). However, one can ask whether any naive correlation seen among apparent nonrepeaters is seen for repeaters, since both would suffer similar biases. To do this, we compare the 2D fluence versus extragalactic DM distributions of apparent nonrepeaters and first-detected repeaters using the 2D K-S test30 described by Peacock (1983) and refined by Fasano &amp; Franceschini (1987). We do the same for the 2D flux versus extragalactic DM distributions. In both cases, the 2D distributions for apparent nonrepeaters and for repeaters are consistent with originating from the same underlying distribution (p 2DK-S = 0.099 for fluence and p 2DK-S = 0.43 for flux). However, the sample size for first-detected repeaters is small, and relatively minor differences in either fluence or flux distributions may not be detectable. Inclusion of S/N &lt; 12 events yields lower p-values: p 2DK-S = 0.015 for fluence and p 2DK-S = 0.051 for flux, still not significant at the &gt;99% level, but possibly noteworthy. Whether the population as a whole exhibits such an anticorrelation, once selection biases are accounted for, is discussed in detail in Section 6.A possible fluence or flux anticorrelation with extragalactic DM is expected since more distant sources should, on average, be fainter.

        <p>Next, we look at distributions of burst intrinsic widths. Figure 14 shows the distributions of measured widths (i.e., no upper limits, with scattering and DM smearing from the finite frequency channel size omitted) for first-detected repeater events and apparent nonrepeaters. For multicomponent bursts, we have plotted the mean of each component width, unless one subcomponent width is an upper limit (two cases), in which case we plot the width of the first subcomponent for which it is measurable. The distributions are statistically extremely Because the mean of the widths of individual subcomponents in multicomponent bursts does not necessarily reflect the overall burst length in those cases, we also show distributions of boxcar widths in Figure 14. Every Catalog 1 event has a measured boxcar width, i.e., there are no upper limits. These widths include intrachannel dispersion smearing and scattering and so are not robust proxies for burst intrinsic width, but they are equally nonrobust for both repeaters and nonrepeaters. Again, the difference in distributions is highly significant (p AD = 1.5 × 10 -4 , p K-S = 2.2 × 10 -4 ). Pleunis et al. (2021) present a more detailed analysis of the morphological properties of our Catalog 1 bursts.Next, we look at distributions of burst intrinsic widths.

        <p>The Catalog 1 values are uncorrected for instrumental bandpass response, however. Under the reasonable assumption that, on average, the correction is the same for nonrepeaters and repeater bursts, we can compare the bandwidth distributions for the two groups. This is shown in Figure 15 (left). A substantial difference in distributions is apparent by eye and confirmed statistically (p AD = 1.3 × 10 -4 , p K-S = 2.3 × 10 -4 ).

        <p>We can also compare distributions of scattering times for apparent nonrepeaters and repeaters in Catalog 1. A difference might be expected if the local source environment between repeaters and nonrepeaters differed, and if scattering in the local environment dominated over other sources of scattering. Figure 15 (right) shows measured scattering times (ignoring upper limits) for the repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters. For repeaters, the scattering time plotted is the most constraining from all of the sources' repeat bursts. Our statistical tests indicate no evidence for the distributions being from different underlying populations (p AD = 0.42, p K-S = 0.32). We also verified this result using the log-rank test and the modified Gehan-Wilcoxon test. Both tests yielded p-values indicating consistent underlying populations, with p = 0.1 and 0.3, respectively.We can also compare distributions of scattering times for apparent nonrepeaters and repeaters in Catalog 1.

        <p>A correlation between scattering times and extragalactic DMs might be expected if scattering is dominated by a component in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and extragalactic DMs are not dominated by host contributions, or conversely if both scattering and extragalactic DM are dominated locally at the source. Any correlation detected in Catalog 1 requires correction due to instrumental biases as discussed below (Section 6.1). However, such biases should be the same for nonrepeaters and repeaters, so it is fair to ask here whether similar correlations exist for both groups. To investigate, we compared the 2D scattering time versus extragalactic DM distributions for apparent nonrepeaters and for first-detected repeaters using the 2D K-S test and found that they are consistent with the distributions originating from the same underlying population (p 2DK-S = 0.10). However, the sample size for first-detected repeaters is small, and minor distribution differences might be yet undetectable. Inclusion of S/N &lt; 12 events yields no interesting difference. We will report on a more detailed analysis of this possible correlation in future work, but we discuss it briefly in Section 7.3.A correlation between scattering times and extragalactic DMs might be expected if scattering is dominated by a component in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and extragalactic DMs are not dominated by host contributions, or conversely if both scattering and extragalactic DM are dominated locally at the source.

        <p>Here we infer the properties of the intrinsic FRB population from the observed CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 data. The central challenge is to account for selection biases, i.e., the fact that the probability to detect an FRB depends on its properties in a complicated way, and to account for instrument-induced errors in the measured quantities. To correct the observed property distributions for these effects, we use the injection system described in Section 4. Here we give a brief overview of the methods used to account for selection effects. A more detailed description of our FRB inference pipeline, including additional methods used for cross-checks, will be described elsewhere.

        <p>For the present population analysis, we will consider six FRB properties: fluence (F), DM, scattering timescale (τ), intrinsic width (w), spectral index (γ), and spectral running (r). Using injections to compensate for selection effects is complicated by the fact that both the selection effects and the intrinsic FRB population may be correlated in the high-dimensional phase space of FRB properties. For instance, we expect a selection bias against high-DM bursts because DM smearing dilutes the burst signal in time. However, this bias is weaker if FRBs have a wider intrinsic pulse profile since the smearing would then have a smaller relative effect. It is also weaker if FRBs have flatter spectra, since a larger fraction of the signal would come from higher frequencies, where the effect of smearing is reduced. There is also an interplay with signal loss from our data filtering and flagging, which more adversely affects low-DM events. Thus, in principle, the distributions of all three of these properties (and in fact all FRB properties) should be modeled and fit simultaneously to be fully consistent.For the present population analysis, we will consider six FRB properties: fluence (F), DM, scattering timescale (τ), intrinsic width (w), spectral index (γ), and spectral running (r).

        <p>We instead make a number of simplifying assumptions and defer a full multidimensional intrinsic correlation analysis to future work. To simplify the analysis, we study FRB properties one or two at a time, holding the distributions for the rest of the properties fixed at a fiducial population model that provides a reasonable overall description of the data.

        <p>First, we set up our formalism and outline our procedure. We wish to make inferences about the intrinsic property rate function of these FRBs: R(F, DM, τ, w, γ, r). However, observational effects mean that not all regions of property space are observed with the same efficiency. We define the observation function to be P(S/N|F, DM, τ, w, γ, r), which describes the stochastic mapping from event properties to S/N (the stochastic mapping is because of a burst's random location in the beam and occurrence relative to time-variable effects such as RFI). In our usage, the observation function is averaged over time and sky location and is affected by the beam, system sensitivity, detection pipeline efficiency, RFI, and other effects.First, we set up our formalism and outline our procedure.

        <p>property. 32 Rigorously testing this assumption is beyond the scope of this paper and will be deferred to future work, except for F and DM, which we study briefly in Section 6.2. Given the limited statistical power of our sample of ∼250 events, we expect such correlations to have a small impact on our results. We do, however, check for intrinsic correlations through a series of jackknife tests described in Section C.3, finding some evidence that such correlations may exist. One complication is that the fluence we measure for a given event is a highly uncertain estimate of the true fluence (due primarily to the uncertain localization and beam sensitivity; see Section 3.4). In addition, we do not currently have the ability to robustly forward model the fluence measurement processes using the injection system. For these reasons, we do not use fluence measurements for our inferences. We can nonetheless make inferences about the intrinsic fluence distribution since the detection S/N (which is robustly modeled using injections) strongly correlates with fluence.

However, if P (S/N|F, DM, τ, w, γ, r) factorizes into separate functions of the FRB properties, this dependence vanishes. In practice, we expect that most selection effects induce correlations in the observed sample at the 10% level, although we defer a detailed study of these correlations to future work.

        <p>We find that, due to a strong selection bias against highly scattered events, the population with scattering time above 10 ms is very poorly constrained. In order for this part of the population to not dominate uncertainties, we cut them from further analysis except for the measurement of s(τ), which is independent of P(τ). In addition, at low τ and w, there is significant measurement uncertainty in these properties, with many measurements in the ∼1 ms range being upper limits. We deal with this uncertainty by using wider 0.5 ms bins below 2 ms and assigning a value of half the 2σ upper limit where these occur (24 events for w and 257 events for τ, before cuts). This treatment is far from ideal but is likely sufficient since the purpose of the fiducial model is only to roughly describe the property distributions for dealing with correlations in the selection effects.We find that, due to a strong selection bias against highly scattered events, the population with scattering time above 10 ms is very poorly constrained.

        <p>In cases where intrinsic correlations might be expected, it is instructive to plot events in property subspaces. Motivated by the jackknife tests in Appendix C.3, we show a number of these subspaces in Figure 19. Note that when viewed in this way, intrinsic correlations (as opposed to correlated selection effects) should manifest as discrepancies between the catalog sample and the intrinsically uncorrelated fiducial model (which may have selection-induced correlations). Our ability to measure the properties of catalog bursts complicates this comparison, although no such correlations are visually obvious. The exception might be S/N and DM, for which there is a deficit of events at high DM and high S/N compared to the fiducial model. We study this in more detail in Section 6.2.In cases where intrinsic correlations might be expected, it is instructive to plot events in property subspaces.

        <p>As mentioned above, the spectral index (γ) and spectral running (r) parameters are observed to be strongly correlated, and due to the observed complexity in this space, we do not attempt to fit a functional form to P(γ, r). Instead, we use kernel density estimation directly on the catalog measurements. Here, there is potential for a large mismatch between the observations and the fiducial model once accounting for selection biases using injections. Indeed, in the left panel of Figure 20, the catalog spans a larger space of spectral parameters than the detected injections. Fortuitously, forward modeling the measurement process of the spectral properties of the detected injections makes them a better match to the catalog. Each injected burst has an associated "intrinsic" spectral parameter. After going through the injection system, the fluence spectrum gets modulated by the beam model and "measured" spectral properties γ and r are fit.

        <p>Here we perform a detailed study of the fluence distribution of FRBs, including a measurement of the absolute rate on the sky. We parameterize the fluence distribution by α, the power-law index for the cumulative distribution such that the number of events occurring above some fluence threshold is N(&gt;F) ∝ F α . We study our population in the property space of fluence and DM (with S/N as the observable proxy for fluence). This is motivated by the fact that we expect DM to be strongly correlated with distance, as in the Macquart relation (Macquart et al. 2020), which should in turn induce intrinsic correlations between DM and fluence. Our data are thus the number of counts N ij in the 2D histogram of the catalog (including 265 events after cuts) in S/N bins labeled by index i and DM bins labeled by index j.Here we perform a detailed study of the fluence distribution of FRBs, including a measurement of the absolute rate on the sky.

The lognormal fit for the fiducial model is a marginal match to the data, although the data are affected by observational uncertainties and the large portion of events for which we measure only upper limits. We find that there is severe selection bias against events with scattering time larger than 10 ms, and the handful of highly scattered events we observed imply that there may be a substantial unobserved population of highly scattered FRBs.To events for which only an upper limit on scattering is measured, we assign a value of 1/2 the 2σ upper limit.

In these tests, we use initial distributions instead of fiducial distributions in Equation (9) since the scattering, widths, and spectral parameters of the injections are drawn from these initial distributions. In all trials we are able to recover the injected fluence distribution (for which α = -1) within statistical uncertainties.

        <p>To understand our rate measurement, it is instructive to determine a rough expectation based on our injection-calibrated completeness shown in Figure 21. This expectation is a strong function of both the fluence of the burst and the S/N threshold for inclusion in the sample. We see that even for very bright bursts with fluence ∼100 Jy ms, our completeness is below 1%. This result is not surprising since CHIME/FRB's field of view is about 0.3% of the sky. For our chosen S/N threshold of 12, the completeness is sharply rising at a fluence of ∼5 Jy ms, so we are mainly sensitive to bursts above this level. If we take c(F = 10 Jyms) ∼ 1 × 10 -3 as a representative value, we obtain a rate of N/(Δt c) ∼ 1200 sky -1 day -1 , above a fluence of 5 Jy ms, close to the value obtained from the full analysis.To understand our rate measurement, it is instructive to determine a rough expectation based on our injection-calibrated completeness shown in Figure 21.

        <p>Properly accounting for the observation function P(S/N|F, DM) is critical to making this measurement and is shown in Figure 24. It can be seen that the S/N distribution of the catalog events is not strikingly different for the low-DM and high-DM samples. However, the low-DM events have a shallower mapping from fluence to S/N. This is somewhat expected since our wideband RFI mitigation clips significant signal from very bright events, an effect that is substantially stronger at low DM.Properly accounting for the observation function P(S/N|F, DM) is critical to making this measurement and is shown in Figure 24.

        <p>Our first CHIME/FRB catalog presents 536 FRB events, detected over a 371 day period, of which 492 are unique sources and 18 are repeating sources. This is the largest catalog of FRBs detected by a single instrument, allowing their characterization in the context of a single set of carefully studied selection biases. We have measured burst properties in a systematic, uniform way. As such, the catalog represents a unique resource for studying the FRB population, such as statistical comparisons between repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters, and the determination of the fluence distribution and rate of FRBs, as presented in this work. Additional analyses of the catalog data are ongoing, including a study of repetition statistics, as well as a volumetric rate analysis. We also have archived complex voltage data on many of the FRBs in this catalog; the analysis of these data is ongoing and beyond the scope of this paper, but it will permit polarimetry, high timeand frequency-resolution studies of burst morphology, and improved localizations for the relevant bursts.Our first CHIME/FRB catalog presents 536 FRB events, detected over a 371 day period, of which 492 are unique sources and 18 are repeating sources.

        <p>Conversely, a single population can have sources of vastly different observational emission properties. For example, the Sun itself produces many different types of radio bursts (see, e.g., Kahler 1992). Perhaps more energetically relevant, radio pulsars exhibit a variety of radio pulse phenomenology, ranging from mode changing and nulling to giant pulses (see, e.g., Manchester &amp; Taylor 1977;Lorimer &amp; Kramer 2012). Emission properties in neutron stars can vary with age as well, with young magnetars being highly X-ray and gamma-ray active, but perhaps subsequently evolving to more stable, fainter "isolated neutron stars" (Kaspi 2010), though in this case differing local environments would be expected.Conversely, a single population can have sources of vastly different observational emission properties.

        <p>Thus, although we have found strong evidence for differing types of emission when comparing repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters (see Pleunis et al. 2021, for further details), it is merely suggestive, but not proof, of different source populations, particularly noting the otherwise-similar property distributions.Thus, although we have found strong evidence for differing types of emission when comparing repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters (see Pleunis et al. 2021, for further details), it is merely suggestive, but not proof, of different source populations, particularly noting the otherwise-similar property distributions.</p>
        <p>Through an extensive program of signal injections (see Section 4), we have characterized the selection effects in our FRB survey, as described in Section 6.1. So far, we have only injected events using a relatively simple signal model. As such, events with complex pulse shapes or spectral structure may not be adequately characterized. In addition, event properties may be correlated, due to either intrinsic correlations in the population or correlated selection effects. We have mitigated the latter by matching to a fiducial model, such that the observed statistics of the injected sample are a good match to those of the catalog. However, we have explicitly ignored most intrinsic correlations. Another area for concern is that we have assumed a lognormal functional form for the DM, width, and scattering distributions and only roughly modeled the distributions of the spectral parameters using a kernel density The low DM range is 100-500 pc cm -3 , and the high DM range is above 500 pc cm -3 . Not included is a systematic uncertainty of - + 0.085 0.030 pc cm -3 , which is shared among DM ranges. When considering nearly the full range of DM detectable by CHIME/FRB, the fluence distribution is consistent with being Euclidean, as expected for a population dominated by source redshifts less than z = 1. However, α is significantly steeper for high-DM events than for low-DM events. This is consistent with the expectation that high-DM events are more distant, and we thus preferentially sample the high end of the luminosity function, which, if well behaved, must be steeper than the low end (see Section 7.4).Through an extensive program of signal injections (see Section 4), we have characterized the selection effects in our FRB survey, as described in Section 6.1.

Not included is a systematic uncertainty of - + 0.085 0.030 pc cm -3 , which is shared among DM ranges. When considering nearly the full range of DM detectable by CHIME/FRB, the fluence distribution is consistent with being Euclidean, as expected for a population dominated by source redshifts less than z = 1. However, α is significantly steeper for high-DM events than for low-DM events. This is consistent with the expectation that high-DM events are more distant, and we thus preferentially sample the high end of the luminosity function, which, if well behaved, must be steeper than the low end (see Section 7.4).</p>

        <p>The methods for accounting for selection bias through Monte Carlo-style real-time injections described here are relatively new. Gupta et al. (2021) have implemented an injection system analogous to that used here, although they do not attempt to model the effects of the telescope beam and have not yet propagated their measured selection effects to detailed population inferences. The most complete treatment of FRB selection effects to date was performed by James et al. (2021aJames et al. ( , 2021b)), who follow an equivalent statistical formalism to that employed here but construct a model for the observation function rather than calibrating it through injections. A failure to account for selection effects will, for any sizable FRB sample, result in incorrect assertions about population distributions. As such, our methods are an important outcome of this work, together with the data presented.The methods for accounting for selection bias through Monte Carlo-style real-time injections described here are relatively new.

        <p>From Figure 16, it is clear that the selection effects in DM are modest and that, at least naively, we appear to be detecting the full range of DMs represented in the population detectable at CHIME/FRB's sensitivity. On one hand, a lognormal distribution peaking at ∼500 pc cm -3 with tails extending to ∼3000 pc cm -3 is a good fit; on the other hand, this should be interpreted in the context of our assumption of negligible intrinsic property correlations. The observed DM distribution could be skewed by a correlation between scattering and DM (which is physically well motivated) or fluence and DM (which we have demonstrated to be present). The latter is of particular concern, since at a lower fluence scale we expect to detect more distant FRBs, having higher DMs.From Figure 16, it is clear that the selection effects in DM are modest and that, at least naively, we appear to be detecting the full range of DMs represented in the population detectable at CHIME/FRB's sensitivity.

        <p>Interpreting the DM distribution with respect to the Macquart relation (Macquart et al. 2020) taken at face value, roughly half of CHIME/FRB-detected FRB sources have a redshift less than 0.5 with a tail extending to ∼2. However, it is possible that the high-DM tail is dominated by host/source-local plasma and that the maximum redshift probed by our data is considerably lower. Regardless, what is clear is that CHIME/FRB is not detecting many z &gt; 3 sources and so may not be helpful for studies requiring such objects (e.g., Beniamini et al. 2021).

        <p>Unsurprisingly, selection effects in the distribution of intrinsic widths are strong: temporally broad events have a more diluted signal, and many of our RFI mitigation strategies have the effect of filtering out signals with long timescales from our data. As such, the median width of the population increases by a factor of two once selection effects are accounted for. Nonetheless, even accounting for selection effects, the rate of events with width in the 10-20 ms range is small compared to those below 10 ms, and it appears to be falling as width increases further (although statistical errors are large in this highly selection-attenuated region). As such, it seems unlikely that there are a large number of FRBs that are undetectable owing to large intrinsic width. We urge some caution when making interpretations here, as intrinsic width is the parameter that is most likely to be affected by the limitations of an injection campaign that used only simple burst morphologies. Our inferences about the width distribution are particularly dependent on our assumption that it is uncorrelated with fluence, rather than uncorrelated with intrinsic peak flux (which is proportional to F/w). Either assumption is astrophysically well motivated, and the choice of one over the other depends further on whether FRB emission is an energy-limited or timelimited process. This in itself is an important question that our data should be able to address; however, we defer such an investigation to future work.Unsurprisingly, selection effects in the distribution of intrinsic widths are strong: temporally broad events have a more diluted signal, and many of our RFI mitigation strategies have the effect of filtering out signals with long timescales from our data.

        <p>In contrast, correcting for selection effects in scattering indicates that there is a substantial population of FRBs with very high scattering that are challenging for CHIME/FRB to observe. In particular, we detected two events35 with scattering time &gt;50 ms, and our injections indicate that for these to have been observed, a huge number of highly scattered events must have gone undetected. Indeed, in Figure 17 we do not see much evidence that the event rate is falling in the 10-100 ms range, and there could be a large population beyond 100 ms that is essentially unconstrained by our data owing to the difficulty of detecting these events. A population synthesis analysis based on the first 13 CHIME-detected FRBs, all of which exhibited scattering timescales &lt;10 ms, suggested that FRBs must be located in environments with stronger scattering properties than the Milky Way ISM (CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2019b).

        <p>Highly scattered events are easier to detect at higher frequencies owing to the steep power-law dependence of scattering time on observing frequency. Scattering timescales have been measured for 18 of the 71 FRBs observed at gigahertz frequencies. 36 Eight of these FRBs have measured scattering times that scale to &gt;100 ms at 600 MHz, assuming a power-law index of -4 for the frequency dependence. Observations of FRBs at frequencies above 1 GHz are thus consistent with the existence of a large population of highly scattered events. We note that the observed number of highly scattered events could also be the result of intrinsic correlations in the population. For instance, if there were a strong correlation between fluence and scattering, we might observe these highly scattered events without their population being particularly large. However, astrophysically, such a correlation seems unlikely since there is no particular reason that fluence, an intrinsic property, should be related to scattering, an extrinsic propagation effect.Highly scattered events are easier to detect at higher frequencies owing to the steep power-law dependence of scattering time on observing frequency.

        <p>A correlation between scattering time and extragalactic DM might be expected, as discussed in Section 5, and would contradict our assumption of independence of these variables (see Section 6). We note that such a correlation is present in the catalog events prior to correction for instrumental biases, though it does not appear strong. As discussed in Appendix C.3, our jackknife tests also hint at a correlation between DM and scattering time after compensating for selection effects. The investigation of the degree of correlation after correction for instrumental biases is beyond the scope of this paper, but it will be discussed in future work.A correlation between scattering time and extragalactic DM might be expected, as discussed in Section 5, and would contradict our assumption of independence of these variables (see Section 6).

        <p>There have been a number of measurements of the FRB fluence distribution (Oppermann et al. 2016;Vedantham et al. 2016;Amiri et al. 2017;Lawrence et al. 2017;Bhandari et al. 2018;Shannon et al. 2018;Patel et al. 2018), the most recent of which have been consistent with α = -3/2, with some exceptions (James et al. 2019;Agarwal et al. 2020). Agarwal et al.

They found α = -0.91 ± 0.34, a nearly 2σ disagreement with the Euclidean expectation. A central challenge of meta-analyses of this type is the comparison of samples from different instruments and surveys. In particular, the effects of beam model errors tend to cancel in the measurement of α so long as the sample is detected through a single beam (Connor 2019). James et al.

        <p>Recently, Lu &amp; Piro (2019) analyzed an ASKAP-detected sample, modeling the FRB energy distribution function and redshift evolution of the volumetric rate and assuming a one-toone DM-distance relation. In such models, α is a derived quantity that cannot deviate strongly from the Euclidean value except in extreme regions of parameter space or for populations much more distant than the ASKAP sample. Thus, their analysis is not completely comparable to direct fits for α, although it does better incorporate the astrophysical effects. However, they do find their model to be consistent with the ASKAP fluences once they account for completeness. Likewise, James et al. (2021aJames et al.

        <p>Because CHIME/FRB observes at significantly lower frequencies than the 1.4 GHz surveys, it is nontrivial to compare the fluence scales of the populations seen at Parkes and ASKAP to that of CHIME/FRB. Nonetheless, given that the median DM of the Parkes sample is ∼900 pc cm -3 compared to ∼500 pc cm -3 for CHIME/FRB, it is plausible that Parkes is seeing a more distant population than is CHIME/ FRB, and is thus seeing cosmological and/or evolutionary effects that flatten the fluence distribution. Indeed, this is the interpretation given by James et al. (2019) and James et al. (2021aJames et al. ( , 2021b)). However, ASKAP is significantly less sensitive than Parkes and sees a sample with median DM ∼400 pc cm -3 , and yet the James et al. (2019) measurement of α is apparently more discrepant from -3/2. Thus, strong departures from the Euclidean value seem difficult to explain for that sample. We note that the α = -3/2 expectation holds only after aggregating over FRBs with all DM values and for samples that are complete in DM. We have shown that the DM completeness of our catalog increases by more than a factor of 2 between 100 and 1000 pc cm -3 , an effect for which we have compensated. In addition, the nonlinear and stochastic mapping between fluence and S/N had to be carefully calibrated for our measurement. The other analyses listed above have not compensated for either effect, and it is unknown whether these effects are strong for the search pipelines at Parkes and ASKAP, although James et al. (2021b) assert them to be negligible.Because CHIME/FRB observes at significantly lower frequencies than the 1.4 GHz surveys, it is nontrivial to compare the fluence scales of the populations seen at Parkes and ASKAP to that of CHIME/FRB.

It is promising that we can now detect the DM dependence of the fluence distribution without the complication of comparing heterogeneous surveys.Our findings are qualitatively consistent with those of Shannon et al.

We note, however, that we have determined our rate using methods that are quite different from how other rates in literature were estimated, specifically in our forward modeling of the multidimensional selection function (determined using injected bursts; see Section 4), including our complex beam response. Direct comparison with other reported rates is therefore dangerous, since other rate measurements did not account for instrumental effects with the same methods. Nevertheless, we proceed with such a comparison, first considering the implications of a simple, naive comparison of published rates, but ultimately recognizing that rate disparities may be a result of different measurement methods and can guide future work on the subject.In this section we compare our measured sky rate to others published in the literature.

(2016). This constraint was obtained assuming that scattering is important from sources other than the Milky Way and IGM, which seems consistent with our preliminary simulation analyses, to be described in future work. Note that the GBNCC spectral index constraint was not altered by the recent detection of GBNCC's first FRB (Parent et al. 2020). In contrast, Macquart et al.

(2019) argue that either ASKAP-derived spectral index is too steep given the low inferred rate from the UTMOST telescope, which operates at 843 MHz, or perhaps there is a spectral turnover below ∼1 GHz. Furthermore, nondetections of bright ASPA FRBs at the Murchison Widefield Array yielded a constraint g -1 ¯ (Sokolowski et al. 2018), also somewhat flatter than the ASKAP value. Here we will start by assuming a simple flat spectral index (g = 0 ¯) in the absence of strong evidence otherwise.where R 5 n is the rate above 5 Jy ms at radio frequency f n . Chawla et al. (2017) constrained the spectral index to be g &gt; -0.3 ¯, fairly flat, using the lack of detections in the 300-400 MHz band from the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) survey and the 1.4 GHz rate from Crawford et al. (2016). This constraint was obtained assuming that scattering is important from sources other than the Milky Way and IGM, which seems consistent with our preliminary simulation analyses, to be described in future work. Note that the GBNCC spectral index constraint was not altered by the recent detection of GBNCC's first FRB (Parent et al. 2020). In contrast, Macquart et al. (2019) report a much steeper spectral index, g = -- + 1.5 0.3 0.2 ¯, based on spectral analysis of 23 ASKAP bursts detected at 1.4 GHz. However, Farah et al.

The fit model for the low-DM events appears to be steeper than that for the high-DM events, despite being derived from a fit value of α ∼ -1 compared to α ∼ -2. The apparent inconsistency is due to a DM-dependent probabilistic mapping from fluence to S/N, which we have calibrated from injections. This is illustrated in the right panel, which shows the S/N and fluence of 200 injected and subsequently detected events in each of two DM ranges, drawn from otherwise-identical property distributions. It can be seen that our detection system has a shallower mapping from fluence to S/N for low-DM events compared to high-DM events, with very few low-DM events achieving an S/N above 100. The latter effect is likely due to our wideband RFI mitigation strategies, which preferentially remove signal from bright, low-DM events. The CHIME/FRB and GBNCC rates are consistent, though the uncertainty on the latter is large. Interestingly, the CHIME/ FRB and UTMOST rates appear to be inconsistent, in spite of the latter's band being close to the high end of CHIME's. We note that the cylindrical Molonglo telescope has a complicated beam structure that would require detailed beam mapping and forward modeling with injections in order to be directly comparable to the instrument-corrected rates presented here for CHIME Catalog 1. Another important issue in comparing these rates lies in the vast bandwidth difference between the two surveys; UTMOST is less likely to see highly band-limited events relative to CHIME/FRB. On the other hand, the majority of CHIME/FRB events are fairly broadband (see Catalog 1 and Figure 15), suggesting that they should be detectable in UTMOST's band.

        <p>Most interestingly, the CHIME/FRB rate is naively consistent within uncertainties with that of Parkes, and only mildly inconsistent with that of ASKAP,37 differing by &lt;2.2σ. This supports our assumption of a flat spectral index and argues against a spectral turnover below 1 GHz as suggested by Farah et al. (2019). On the other hand, if the small difference in CHIME/FRB and ASKAP rates is fully attributable to a spectral index, we find g = -  0.71 0.37 ¯, flatter than reported by Macquart et al. (2019) at the 1.7σ level. However, such a conclusion ignores the possible influence of a large, highly scattered population undetected by CHIME/FRB; for g = 0 ¯, the proximity of the CHIME/FRB and 1.4 GHz rates suggests that such a population is small, as otherwise the 1.4 GHz rate would be higher than that at 600 MHz. If such a population is large, the spectral index is likely steeper than inferred above. In this case, it would have to be a coincidence that the effects of scattering and spectral index nearly cancel each other out in the relevant frequency range. As emphasized above, a detailed and conclusive comparison requires more uniform consideration of selection biases for the various measurements, as well as additional forward modeling to account for yet-unmodeled population properties such as bandwidth and frequency distributions.Most interestingly, the CHIME/FRB rate is naively consistent within uncertainties with that of Parkes, and only mildly inconsistent with that of ASKAP,37 differing by &lt;2.2σ.

However, the cut events have weights that are systematically different from a typical event, especially for τ, where the cut events are upweighted by the fitting procedure because of the low selection function. A precise accounting for the expected statistical fluctuation in each jackknife is beyond the scope of this paper. The standard deviation of the random jackknives nonetheless gives a rough sense for how much we expect parameters to vary, and the tests are valuable to search for strong biases and strong property correlations of the type that might invalidate conclusions drawn from our analysis.The results of the iterative model fitting for these jackknives are quoted in Table 4.

        <p>Shifting the S/N cut does produce a shift in α of ∼0.1, which is larger than one might expect given the modest change in event numbers. This may be an indication of residual bias from human classification, although this explanation is at odds with the fact that the shift in α is in the same direction when either raising or lowering the threshold. There would also seem to be a significant change in the width scale parameter. This might indicate a negative correlation between fluence (which is correlated with S/N) and width, although we find this to be physically implausible. Another explanation is that this is a measurement effect, with narrow widths difficult to measure to low-S/N events, yielding upper limits that may be significantly higher than their true values. We note that our analysis fully compensates for completeness as a function of properties such as w, but not in errors in the measurement of the properties themselves.Shifting the S/N cut does produce a shift in α of ∼0.1, which is larger than one might expect given the modest change in event numbers.

        <p>Jackknives in DM, w, or τ all result in changes in the α parameters. For DM, this change in α is studied in detail in Section 6.2. The shift for the w jackknife is not particularly significant compared to the random jackknives. Interpreting the shift for the τ jackknife is complicated by the highly nonuniform weighting of events as a function of τ, making the expected statistical fluctuation difficult to calculate.Jackknives in DM, w, or τ all result in changes in the α parameters.

        <p>These jackknives also result in shifts in the DM, w, or τ scale parameters consistent with order-unity correlations between these properties. In particular, we see hints of a positive DM-τ correlation, from both the change in DM scale in the τ jackknife and the change in the τ scale in the DM jackknife. Such a correlation is well motivated physically and will be studied in detail in future work. Likewise, there is evidence for a w-τ correlation, although this is likely a measurement effect since these properties are particularly hard to disentangle observationally.These jackknives also result in shifts in the DM, w, or τ scale parameters consistent with order-unity correlations between these properties.

        <p>There are several sources of systematic errors in our measurements. Obtaining the sky rate requires an absolute accounting of the survey duration Δt. As described in Section 2.2, our effective survey duration is 214.8 days. Note that periods where the system was operating well below nominal sensitivity have been excluded from this figure and any bursts discovered during these periods have been excluded from the population analysis.There are several sources of systematic errors in our measurements.

        <p>Nonetheless, our measurement of the overall rate depends on the sensitivity during the injection campaign (which occurred in 2020 August) being representative of the full Catalog 1 period. Between the beginning of the survey and the injection campaign, we estimate that our noise levels have improved by 6%, based on daily observations of the S/Ns of pulsar singlepulse detections. The change since the midpoint of the survey period was 3%. To compensate for this, we reduce our effective survey duration by |α| × 3%, using α = -3/2, which is the value for a stationary universe and is consistent with our measurement in Section 6.2. We allow for a corresponding systematic error in our rate measurement of |α| × 3% = 4.5%. Another source of systematic error in the rate is incompleteness in Catalog 1 not accounted for by injections. Injected events are only processed by our automated pipeline and lack a final human classification step required for true events. However, our human classification should be complete above an L1 S/N of 12. There are 28 cases where an FRB candidate was successfully classified by the automated pipeline, but due to a system error, no intensity data were saved. Of these, 16 events would have passed our cuts on S/N and occurred during periods where the system was otherwise operating nominally. For such events, we have no way of knowing whether they would have survived human classification or our other various data cuts. This leads to an additional, one-sided systematic error in the rate of +16/265 = +6.0%.Nonetheless, our measurement of the overall rate depends on the sensitivity during the injection campaign (which occurred in 2020 August) being representative of the full Catalog 1 period.

        <p>A large source of uncertainty in our analysis is the telescope beam. The CHIME beam model used for injections is described in Section 4. This model was verified by comparing to measurements of the Sun over the decl. range ±23°.4, as well as holographic measurements of bright persistent sources for a few specific declinations (see Section 2.1). The discrepancy between these measurements and our primary beam model, in units of the peak power response at the decl. of Cygnus A, is of order 0.1 in the main lobe and 0.01 in the near sidelobes. These discrepancies vary in magnitude and sign as a function of both frequency and declination. As such, we expect a high degree of cancellation in averages over frequencies and beams. Nonetheless, to conservatively account for errors in the main-lobe response, we assign a systematic uncertainty in our rate measurement of |α| × 10% = 15%. We are insensitive to beam model errors in the sidelobes since we are able to identify sidelobe FRB detections from their spectral characteristics and have cut them from our analysis. However, some possibility of sidelobe contamination from narrowband bursts does exist.A large source of uncertainty in our analysis is the telescope beam.

        <p>In our α measurement, we do not account for systematic error from the beam, which should be small because our analysis uses S/N as our observable rather than fluence directly. It has been shown that the S/N distribution power-law index is unaffected by the telescope beam (Oppermann et al. 2016;Connor 2019;James et al. 2019), provided that FRB fluences are distributed as a single power law, the instrumental S/N is linear in the FRB fluence, and chromatic effects are ignored. All three of these assumptions are violated; however, we account for these in our primary analysis, relying on them only at the level of the beam model uncertainty. The effect on our α measurement is thus second order (an error on an error) and can be neglected.In our α measurement, we do not account for systematic error from the beam, which should be small because our analysis uses S/N as our observable rather than fluence directly.

        <p>To avoid a high-dimensional fitting problem and to make best use of our finite injection sample, we have opted to study FRBs in the property space of fluence and DM, fixing the other properties at their fiducial distributions. This treatment can induce errors that are not accounted for in the statistical uncertainty in two ways. First, even if our model without intrinsic correlations were correct, not fitting simultaneously would mean that we neglect correlated statistical errors in the distribution parameters. For instance, a 1σ fluctuation in the scattering scale parameter would shift the scattering distribution to a region with more or less selection bias, resulting in a different inferred overall rate. Second, our model where the FRB properties are intrinsically uncorrelated could be incorrect. Indeed, Table 4 contains evidence for correlations among fluence, DM, width, and scattering. As an estimate for how large these errors could be, we perturb the scale parameters for both width and scattering. We perturb by ±1 ms for the scattering scale and by ±0.3 ms for the width scale, inspired by the magnitude of deviation we see in Table 4. The perturbation in scattering scale has the larger effect, resulting in changes in α of ±0.03 and in the overall rate of - + 20%To avoid a high-dimensional fitting problem and to make best use of our finite injection sample, we have opted to study FRBs in the property space of fluence and DM, fixing the other properties at their fiducial distributions.

        <p>As previously discussed, another concern is incompleteness in Catalog 1 from human classification that is not reflected in the injections. Shifting our S/N cut from 12 to 16 changes α by -0.08 and the rate by +10%. While these changes are largely within the expectation for statistical fluctuations from the number of cut events, they are in the direction one would expect for residual incompleteness at low S/N. We thus conservatively include these figures in our systematic error budget.As previously discussed, another concern is incompleteness in Catalog 1 from human classification that is not reflected in the injections.

        <p>Prior to the addition of the RFI classification bypass for high-S/N events described in Section 2, there were three events with S/N  100 that were likely to have been astrophysical but are not included in Catalog 1, as they were classified as RFI, and thus their data were not retained. Including these events in the population analysis shifts α by + 0.05 (which we include in our error budget) but has a negligible effect on the rate.Prior to the addition of the RFI classification bypass for high-S/N events described in Section 2, there were three events with S/N  100 that were likely to have been astrophysical but are not included in Catalog 1, as they were classified as RFI, and thus their data were not retained.

        <p>During the Catalog 1 period and between then and the injection period, there have been a number of other changes to our detection pipeline, including changes to the RFI cleaning and the addition of automated classifiers employing machine learning. In addition, there have been changes in the RFI environment at the telescope site. While these changes are difficult to quantify, they should be an overall small effect above our relatively high S/N cutoff for statistical analysis of 12. The assessment of the effect of changing the S/N cutoff in the previous paragraph also partially accounts for this effect, as does our tracking of the overall telescope sensitivity using pulsar pulses.During the Catalog 1 period and between then and the injection period, there have been a number of other changes to our detection pipeline, including changes to the RFI cleaning and the addition of automated classifiers employing machine learning.

        <p>Here we detail the procedure for finding a fiducial model for the property distributions P(F), P(DM), P(τ), P(w), and P(γ, r), as introduced in Section 6. The purpose of the fiducial model is to provide not a precise description of the true property distributions but a rough one, such that correlated selection effects are accounted for when performing deeper analyses in property subspaces.Here we detail the procedure for finding a fiducial model for the property distributions P(F), P(DM), P(τ), P(w), and P(γ, r), as introduced in Section 6.

        <p>3. For the spectral index γ and running r, we fit a kernel density estimator to their joint observed distribution and equate it to the intrinsic distribution without compensating for selection effects. However, we do verify that, once accounting for measurement effects from the beam, the final population model provides a reasonable description of the catalog data (see Figure 20).3.

        <p>Rather than performing a joint fit to the parameters of all property distributions simultaneously, we use an iterative fitting scheme, where we optimize the parameters of each population factor P(ξ) independently while keeping the other parameters fixed. This method is possible because of our assumption that the rate function factorizes, and it is necessary because of our limited injection sample-we do not have enough injections to fully determine the 7D observation function P(S/N|F, DM, τ, w, γ, r); however, we can determine certain integrals thereof. We are currently exploring the use of machine learning to fully determine the observation function.Rather than performing a joint fit to the parameters of all property distributions simultaneously, we use an iterative fitting scheme, where we optimize the parameters of each population factor P(ξ) independently while keeping the other parameters fixed.

On each iteration i, and for each property ξ in (F, DM, τ, w), form the selection function s i (ξ) = P obs,i (ξ)/P i (ξ), obtaining the observed distribution from the injection system. 3. Fit a model P obs (ξ) = s i (ξ)P i+1 (ξ) to the catalog data. 4. Iterate steps 2 and 3 until convergence. The converged result is the fiducial model.1.

        <p>The initial pdf's P init (ξ) are the same as those used for the injection population described in Section 4.1.2 and are designed to both fully sample the range of observed properties and more densely sample parts of phase space populated by the catalog. We take care to apply the same cuts to the injected events as we did to the catalog, including automated RFI classification, and cuts on galactic DM. Less than half of the 84,697 detected injections survive these cuts, with most of the attrition coming from the S/N &gt; 12 requirement for population analysis.

        <p>Our injection sample was drawn from R init (F, DM, τ, w, γ, r), providing corresponding samples of / S N, DM, obs,init (  t g w r , , , ) after injection. These can be converted to estimates of P init (ξ) and P obs,init (ξ) by accumulating these samples from the full and detected injections into histograms, respectively.

        <p>Accumulating the FRB injection sample into histograms, counting each event with weight W then provides estimates of P(ξ) (for the full injection sample) and P obs (ξ) (for the detected events) for the new model rather than the initial model. P obs (ξ) is thus our prediction for the catalog, to which we fit the underlying parameters by optimizing a likelihood analogous to Equation (13) (holding the distributions of properties other than ξ fixed on a given iteration).Accumulating the FRB injection sample into histograms, counting each event with weight W then provides estimates of P(ξ) (for the full injection sample) and P obs (ξ) (for the detected events) for the new model rather than the initial model.

        <p>Jackknife tests provide a way to search for inconsistencies in the data by splitting the sample by some criteria and comparing the changes in the analysis results to those expected statistically from the cut. A full study of the uncertainty in the fiducial model (either statistical or systematic) is beyond the scope of this work, since it is only used as a starting point for further analysis. However, we can use our procedure for finding the fiducial model to search for systematic errors, as well as test our strongest assumption: that the FRB properties are intrinsically uncorrelated. We note that we do perform an accounting of uncertainties for our final α and sky-rate measurements in Appendix D, much of which is informed by the jackknife tests presented here.Jackknife tests provide a way to search for inconsistencies in the data by splitting the sample by some criteria and comparing the changes in the analysis results to those expected statistically from the cut.
