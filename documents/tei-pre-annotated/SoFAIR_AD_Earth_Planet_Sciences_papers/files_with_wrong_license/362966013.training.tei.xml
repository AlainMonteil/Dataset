        <p>Ocean acidification (OA) along the US West Coast is intensifying faster than observed in the global ocean. This is particularly true in nearshore regions (&lt; 200 m) that experience a lower buffering capacity while at the same time providing important habitats for ecologically and economically significant species. While the literature on the effects of OA from laboratory experiments is voluminous, there is little understanding of present-day OA in-situ effects on marine life. Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) is perennially one of the most valuable commercial and recreational fisheries. We focused on establishing OA-related vulnerability of larval crustacean based on mineralogical and elemental carapace to external and internal carapace dissolution by using a combination of different methods ranging from scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental mapping and X-ray diffraction. By integrating carapace features with the chemical observations and biogeochemical model hindcast, we identify the occurrence of external carapace dissolution related to the steepest calcite gradients ( cal,60 ) in the water column. Dissolution features are observed across the carapace, pereopods (legs), and around the calcified areas surrounding neuritic canals of mechanoreceptors. The carapace dissolution is the most extensive in the coastal habitats under prolonged (1-month) long exposure, as demonstrated by the use of the model hindcast. Such dissolution has a potential to destabilize mechanoreceptors with important sensory and behavioral functions, a pathway of sensitivity to OA. Carapace dissolution is negatively related to crab larval width, demonstrating a basis for energetic trade-offs. Using a retrospective prediction from a regression models, we estimate an 8.3% increase in external carapace dissolution over the last two decades and identified a set of affected OA-related sublethal pathways to inform future risk assessment studies of Dungeness crabs.Ocean acidification (OA) along the US West Coast is intensifying faster than observed in the global ocean.

        <p>Since the pre-industrial era, anthropogenic CO 2 uptake along the US West Coast have resulted in rapid intensification OA rate on a global scale (Chavez et al., 2017;Feely et al., 2016), resulting in lower carbonate conditions compared to the pre-industrial times. This is because of the low regional buffering capacity, which contributes to low pH and carbonate ara cal ) (Feely et al., 2018). These changes in carbonate chemistry have resulted in in substantially reduced habitat suitability for marine calcifiers ( 2014;Somero et al., 2015). These findings are supported by the field and synthesis work along the North American Pacific demonstrating that calcifying invertebrates will be the ones most impacted by progressive OA ( 2017;Busch &amp; McElhany, 2016). Apart from evidence of OA impacts on pteropods and other calcifiers caused by the low ara conditions in upwelling systems ( 2014,2017) and around CO 2 vent seeps and sites (Manno et al., 2019;Tunnicliffe et al., 2009), there is limited understanding of present-day OA effects on marine life in situ. That is especially relevant for the crustaceans since they were considered less sensitive to OA parameters (like pCO 2 or pH) after studies demonstrated their capacity to abate initial hypercapnia and to buffer extracellular acidbase disturbances (Melzner et al., 2009;Pane and Barry, 2007) with limited or no change in aerobic metabolism (Paganini et al., 2014). However, restoring internal pH to sustain physiological and biogeochemical processes (Somero, 1986), typically requires activation of buffering, which is energetically expensive process (Cameron, 1985;Michaelidis et al., 2005).Since the pre-industrial era, anthropogenic CO 2 uptake along the US West Coast have resulted in rapid intensification OA rate on a global scale (Chavez et al., 2017;Feely et al., 2016), resulting in lower carbonate conditions compared to the pre-industrial times.

        <p>Recent experimental findings have demonstrated increased sensitivity to OA-related stressors in crustaceans, especially in the early life stages that can be regarded as a potential bottleneck for the population level responses (Schiffer et al., 2014;Small et al., 2015). Regardless of the habitats that different species inhabit, the studies investigating OA effect on larval stages reported lower growth and decreased survival of blue crab (Giltz and Taylor, 2017), delayed metamorphosis in the stone crab (Gravinese et al., 2018), changes in exoskeleton composition (Page et al., 2016) and decreased metabolisms in Tanner crabs (Long et al., 2016) and increased energetic costs in the porcelain crab (Carter et al., 2013), while the pre-larval of the Dungeness crab showed reduced survival and slower progression through the development (Miller et al., 2016). With annual revenues up to $220 million (Hodgson et al., 2018;Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, 2019), the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) is one of the most valuable and recreational fisheries in the US coastal waters. Terminal stage of pelagic Dungeness crab larvae (megalopae) undergoes long distance transport along the north Pacific coast of North America before settling in suitable benthic settlement site (Shanks, 1995;Sinclair, 1988). Given their diel vertical migration extends down to 60 m depth (Hobbs et al., 1992), megalopae encounter steep vertical pH, cal gradients in coastal habitats; however, the duration and magnitude of their exposure to these conditions remains largely unknown despite the exposure history notably impacting organismal responses (sensu Bednar ek et al. (2017).Recent experimental findings have demonstrated increased sensitivity to OA-related stressors in crustaceans, especially in the early life stages that can be regarded as a potential bottleneck for the population level responses (Schiffer et al., 2014;Small et al., 2015).

        <p>To start addressing potential OA vulnerability of the pelagic Dungeness larvae in situ, their spatial distribution must be paired with in situ exposure history (as defined in al., 2017), understanding of their physiological susceptibility and their structural and mineralogical features. In regards to the later, surprisingly little is known about these features that can predispose an individual to extensive exoskeleton dissolution if the conditions in the external environment are conducive for it. In addition, for detecting environmental clues, the decapod exoskeleton contains elongated hair-like structures called setae, which are important chemo-and mechanoreceptors involved in sensory and behavioral responses. While the lipoproteic epicuticle-covered exoskeleton consists of two cuticular mineral carbonate layers (Chen et al., 2008) (i.e., the outer exocuticle and the inner endocuticle) in the Dungeness crab adults such structure or its composition is completely unknown for the larvae.To start addressing potential OA vulnerability of the pelagic Dungeness larvae in situ, their spatial distribution must be paired with in situ exposure history (as defined in al., 2017), understanding of their physiological susceptibility and their structural and mineralogical features.

        <p>This interdisciplinary study integrates physical, geochemical, biological, and modelling components across the individual and population-level parameters. Identification of the carapace crystalline mineralogical and elemental composition provided an understanding behind the extensive exoskeleton dissolution and mechanoreceptor damage. The latter was linked with the chemical observations made along the North American West Coast to identify the drivers and OA hotspots of in situ megalopae vulnerability. The biogeochemical model hindcast was used to determine the impact of in situ exposure history in the coastal habitats.This interdisciplinary study integrates physical, geochemical, biological, and modelling components across the individual and population-level parameters.

Data on the conductivity, temperature, and pressure of seawater (CTD) were collected along cross-shelf transects, accompanied by biological stations with vertical sections of temperature (T), salinity, nutrients, oxygen, chlorophyll-a (chl-a), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), spectrophotometric pH (measured at 25°C and corrected to in situ temperatures, and expressed on the total pH scale, subsequently expressed pH T ). pCO 2 and calcite saturation state ( cal ) were calculated using CO2SYS as described by Feely et al.

Larvae were collected using Neuston and B , which were deployed in an oblique manner at 10 stations during the night in the upper surface waters, an area that encompasses the nocturnal vertical habitat of larval Dungeness crabs of the upper 60 m (Hobbs et al., 1992;Morgan, 1985), with the following environmental parameters along the vertical habitat (Table S1). The duration of tows was 15 20 min.

        <p>Using SEM methods to detect and evaluate carapace dissolution Megalopae carapaces were investigated using a combination of different methods: 1) scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi Phenom, USA) to determine potential structural changes on the cuticular surface; 2) energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS at the University of Washington) for mineralogical composition; 3) elemental mapping; and X-ray diffraction (University of Washington and Max Planck Institute) for elemental content across mostly lipoproteic carapace (Figure S1, Fig. 1). Here, we define exoskeleton as the cuticle covering the dorsal part of the carapace of the larval crab, and five pereopods, with chelae. The carapace epicuticle, which otherwise overlies the crystalline layer and makes dissolution observations impossible, was removed from each megalopa prior to analysis. This was accomplished using sodium hypochlorite, which efficiently removes the epicuticle but does not damage the crystalline layers underneath, even at high concentrations ( , 2012). On the samples with no hypochlorite treatment, the epicuticle covered the crystalline layer so no investigation of dissolution was possible. Therefore, we tested different concentrations and duration of hypochlorite treatment on the individuals from the same station to ensure that we fully removed the epicuticle, without triggering dissolution of the calcite crystalline layers beneath it. The combination of 1 and 3 % sodium hypochlorite with 15, 30, and 120 min treatments only partially removed the epicuticle, , while 6% hypochlorite treatments for 4 and 6 hours were effective in epicuticle removal, without inducing additional dissolution at the longer duration.Using SEM methods to detect and evaluate carapace dissolution Megalopae carapaces were investigated using a combination of different methods: 1) scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi Phenom, USA) to determine potential structural changes on the cuticular surface; 2) energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS at the University of Washington) for mineralogical composition; 3) elemental mapping; and X-ray diffraction (University of Washington and Max Planck Institute) for elemental content across mostly lipoproteic carapace (Figure S1, Fig. 1).

        <p>To determine the treatment does not induce any damage, we have tested the individuals from the same stations with different combination of treatments. We assumed the similarity of exposure history of individuals within the same stations (see modelling section). The results of no difference in dissolution under the different combination of concentration/duration of treatment combination was a confirmation that the treatment did not induce any additional damage, and thus did not confound our field observations.To determine the treatment does not induce any damage, we have tested the individuals from the same stations with different combination of treatments.

        <p>We determined 6% hypochlorite for 3-4 h to be an efficient and effective treatment, similar to the treatment previously described for the removal of the periostracum in pteropods ( et al., 2012). After soaking in sodium hypochlorite, samples were rinsed several times in Millipore water to remove any organic matter remaining on the surface of the exoskeleton. It is important to note that when examining the presence of setae within the neuritic canals, we did not use any treatment in order to avoid any methodological artifacts. When examining the internal area of the cuticle, we avoided examining the proximity of the gills given that dissolution could be impacted by the processes around. To quantify the dissolution of internal carapace cuticle, the pereopods and soft tissue of larvae were gently removed from the rest of the body and washed in Millipore water to remove any remaining tissue or organics before treatment with sodium hypochlorite. Each of the five pereopod cuticle was examined across the proximal and distal ends, with particular focus on chelae (Figure S2). SEM was used to evaluate the extent and severity of dissolution. We focused on three distinct features: ridging structures, dissolution around setae, and exposed calcite crystals (Figure S2,S3).We determined 6% hypochlorite for 3-4 h to be an efficient and effective treatment, similar to the treatment previously described for the removal of the periostracum in pteropods ( et al., 2012).

        <p>For estimating the various body parameter change (in mm) of larvae across various vertical OA gradients, we have measured carapace length (CL), total length from rostrum to telson (TL), length from rostrum to dorsal carapace spine (R-DCS), and carapace width (CW).For estimating the various body parameter change (in mm) of larvae across various vertical OA gradients, we have measured carapace length (CL), total length from rostrum to telson (TL), length from rostrum to dorsal carapace spine (R-DCS), and carapace width (CW).</p>
        <p>The CW is the most commonly used parameter by various US federal agencies along the US West Coast to regulate crab management catch efforts (Davis et al., 2017). Here, we assume that all the larvae were released at the same time to allow for body parameter comparisons across different stations. Using the methodology to characterize the megalopae stages by González-Gordillo et al. (2004), we determined that all megalopae were in the intermolt stage, except for those from Station 115, which were transitioning into the premolt stage. We excluded the results of the internal dissolution observations from this station in case promoting process changed any features on the internal side that could bias accurate dissolution assessment.The CW is the most commonly used parameter by various US federal agencies along the US West Coast to regulate crab management catch efforts (Davis et al., 2017).

        <p>Approximately 10 20 SEM images were produced per individual on the external and internal sides, with the images being manually examined to detect any signs of dissolution. For crystal exposure characterization, the same categorization of dissolution conditions as previously described in pteropods was used ( , 2012).

        <p>Figure S1; Table S2). These features differentiated damaged surfaces from the intact surfaces (Table S2). The cuticular surface of the carapace and the pereopods under high cal in situ conditions had a smooth, sleek appearance (Figure S2; Stage 0).

Signs of dissolution tended to be more prevalent and more severe on the surface immediately surrounding setae pores.Figure S1; Table S2).

        <p>Consequently, areas around the setae were considered separately from the rest of the exoskeleton. From these observations, a semi-quantitative scoring metric was developed based on previous work on pteropods and used to score the remainder of the samples. For each sample, the three separate features (presence and depth of ridge structures, exposure of individual calcite crystals, and the prevalence of dissolution features around setae pores) were each assigned a score. The features were scored on a scale of 0 to 1 based on the severity of dissolution: intact exoskeleton with no dissolution received a score of 0; moderate dissolution received a score of 0.5; and substantial dissolution of all examined features was scored 1 (Figures S1 S3). Since the crab exoskeleton of the carapace and pereopod differ in their chemical composition, these three areas were assigned separate scores. Because of the surface analyses required separately for the external and internal dissolution, both types of analyses could not be conducted on the same individual. All three features displayed similar trends, so the scores were averaged to unitless Observation of setae presence/absence was included in the exoskeleton observation under SEM on intact specimen before any preparation treatments were conducted to eliminate the possibility of preparation steps affecting setae presence or outrooting them from the carapace.Consequently, areas around the setae were considered separately from the rest of the exoskeleton.

        <p>The mineralogy of selected megalopae was characterized using X-ray diffraction (D8 Discover 2D; University of Washington, Seattle). Prior to analysis, carapaces from five megalopae at each site were coarsely crushed and treated for 10 min using a dilute (3%) sodium hypochlorite solution to minimize interference from organic matter but without compromising mineralized structures. Samples were dried completely and then ground to a fine homogenous powder representing the aggregate of the five individuals from each location. Resulting diffractograms were compared to a catalog of mineral-specific patterns to constrain the primary mineralogy of each sample.The mineralogy of selected megalopae was characterized using X-ray diffraction (D8 Discover 2D; University of Washington, Seattle).

This measurement characterized the relative cal gradients with increasing depth and accounted for differences in the relative magnitudes of cal between stations. Chlorophyll-a observations were highly skewed and so were log-transformed prior to analysis.Biological measurements from Dungeness megalopae collected at 10 stations along the North American Pacific Coast (Figure 2) were paired with synoptic environmental data from CTD profiles.

        <p>Biological responses included dissolution, body parameter, and abundance with various environmental vertical gradients to identify significant associations using generalized linear models.

Finally, all variables were evaluated together to identify pairwise associations using Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) to characterize how the biological response measures were jointly explained by the environmental variables. For the latter analysis, all input data were standardized to range from 0 to 1 to account for differences in scale between variables. The

        <p>For selected predictors, additional models were developed to evaluate the additive effects of two predictors on dissolution. Backward model selection was used to identify the most parsimonious model by sequentially dropping individual predictors and comparing Akaike Information Criterion values (AIC) (Akaike, 1973;Fox and Weisberg, 2011). This allowed us to determine if there was any additional power in combining predictors to explain dissolution, or consequently, if dissolution could be sufficiently explained using only one predictor. For example, the ability of both cal and chlorophyll to explain dissolution were evaluated to better understand the relative effects of both.For selected predictors, additional models were developed to evaluate the additive effects of two predictors on dissolution.

        <p>The compilation of our results demonstrate that the carapace is highly mineralized and precipitated into a chitin-proteinaceous matrix. XRD identify calcite as a primary polymorph in the carapace. The mineralized exoskeleton of the megalopae intermolt stages consists of the thinner exocuticle on the surface that is less than 2 3 µm thick, and the thicker and more compact endocuticle underneath (Figure 1) of approximately 6 7 µm, with the combined thickness up to 10 µm. The carapace surface is extensively covered with setae that are rooted in the calcified neuritic canals each with an average of about 5 µm surface opening (Figures S2 andS3). EDXS investigations characterized detailed elemental structure with average Ca 2+ content of 28 % in the carapace and pereopods, with much higher Ca 2+ found within in the mid layer and the endocuticle (higher than 50%) compared to less than 20% found in the exocuticle (Figure 1).The compilation of our results demonstrate that the carapace is highly mineralized and precipitated into a chitin-proteinaceous matrix.

The percentage of different dissolution features is similar between the carapace and the pereopods, however with much less variation in all elements between the carapace and pereopods (Figure S1). This elemental composition indicates that other crystalline forms of carbonate could be precipitated into a chitin-proteinaceous matrix, such as an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) crystalline layer, but the methods used were not suitable for ACC detection.

        <p>At sites with a small cal,60 , the external surface of the carapace was characterized by predominantly smooth surfaces, the absence of dissolution, and the presence of setae (Figures 7 andS2). Ridging features were present on all examined carapaces but significantly increased at the stations with the greatest cal,60 difference (Figures 4 and5). This presence of ridging features co-occurred with the increased occurrence of crystal exposure, ranging from increased porosity (Stage 1) to exposed crystals (Stage 2) at the sites with cal,60 difference, and deeper-protruding dissolution at the sites with cal,60 difference (Stage 2). Using image analysis, the depth of ridging structures was estimated at approximately 2 µm, around 25% of the cuticle thickness. Given the exocuticle thickness of 2 3µm, the dissolution extended into the endocuticle (Figure 6). The extent of dissolution on pereopod exoskeleton was comparable with the external dissolution, especially at the higher dissolution values (Figure S5; R 2 = 0.65; p = 0.0047, slope = 0.901), indicating that both features were reliable metrics for dissolution assessment.At sites with a small cal,60 , the external surface of the carapace was characterized by predominantly smooth surfaces, the absence of dissolution, and the presence of setae (Figures 7 andS2).

        <p>There was a distinct pattern of severe dissolution specifically developed around the calcified neuritic canals (Figure 6). In megalopae collected at inshore stations (&lt; 200 m bottom depth), the carapace surface around the neuritic canals was markedly dissolved (Stage 2), and mechanoreceptors were often absent. Dissolution around the neuritic canals appeared to alter the morphology of the setae (Figure 6). Setae edges were partially collapsed at the places where the mechanoreceptors are anchored in, with the initial ridging features around the canals degenerated cal,60 values (Figure 6). On the megalopae from offshore stations with a smaller cal,60 the mechanoreceptors were present with no damage around the neuritic canals and less severe dissolution. Within the region of altered setae, dissolution up to 2 3 µm around the setae (Figure S4) was accompanied by significant canal deformation. This deformation appears to destabilize the attachment of the setae anchor, calcified neuritic canals, we noted the absence of setae but have not yet quantified the frequency of this occurrence.There was a distinct pattern of severe dissolution specifically developed around the calcified neuritic canals (Figure 6).

        <p>To our knowledge this is the first time that OA-related dissolution of calcite structures in situ has been demonstrated for crustaceans. Our results indicate that it is the exposure to both parameters, cal,60 (i.e. the difference in calcite saturation depth between the surface and 60 m depth) and pCO 2 , set up by as well as prolonged (&lt;1 month) retention in the coastal waters that characterizes the suite of in situ parameters determining the larval crab vulnerability. This primarily demonstrates that it is not just the mean state OA conditions, but also the vertical difference in the water column that can induce negative biological responses. Using a retrospective prediction from a regression model (Figure 5a), we estimate an 8.3% increase in the extent of external carapace dissolution over the last two decades. This postchanges of 0.02 unit per decade (Carter et al., 2018), comparing current average with the extent of dissolution predicted from our regression model based on the in situ observations (Figure 5a with the equation in the figure content) by using the estimated pH conditions two decades prior.To our knowledge this is the first time that OA-related dissolution of calcite structures in situ has been demonstrated for crustaceans.

        <p>What makes this OA-dependent dissolution of megalopae particularly relevant is that the crab samples originated in the supersaturated conditions with respect to calcite (the lowest calc =1.41). Since the dissolution reported in other calcifiers has been demonstrated above ara of 1.4 1.5 ( and Ohman, 2015;et al., 2016), we conclude that exoskeleton dissolution is initiated at higher cal,60 than predicted based on thermodynamic principles alone.What makes this OA-dependent dissolution of megalopae particularly relevant is that the crab samples originated in the supersaturated conditions with respect to calcite (the lowest calc =1.41).

        <p>Furthermore, using exposure metrics based on the biogeochemical model output demonstrates that 1-month long exposure in coastal habitats with large cal,60 values can result in significantly more dissolution than predicted based on snap-shot observational data. In comparison with the chemical observations, particle tracking model output indicates prolonged severity of exposure to the coastal low OA conditions, allowing for more extensive exoskeleton dissolution and reduced larval width in those habitats. It is worth noting that dissolution could be viewed as a physiological strategy to compensate against unfavorable external conditions.Furthermore, using exposure metrics based on the biogeochemical model output demonstrates that 1-month long exposure in coastal habitats with large cal,60 values can result in significantly more dissolution than predicted based on snap-shot observational data.

        <p>Dissolution of the outer calcite layer could increase the release of the bicarbonate and hydroxyl ions, raising pH, and providing a rapid alkalinization of the superficial layer (Kunkel et al., 2012). This alkaline layer could then provide an additional local protection from exposure to a large cal,60 conditions by blocking protons from continuously invading the internal fluid However, as the larvae live in highly dynamic environments, such a layer would be continuously disrupted, explaining the high extent of external dissolution.Dissolution of the outer calcite layer could increase the release of the bicarbonate and hydroxyl ions, raising pH, and providing a rapid alkalinization of the superficial layer (Kunkel et al., 2012).

        <p>Species with a developed capacity for ion exchange to maintain extracellular acid-base balance, are able to compensate for the effects of exposure to high pCO 2 waters and restore extracellular pH values optimal for physiological and biogeochemical processes (Somero, 1986). They do so via energetically expensive buffering of intra-and extracellular compartments achieved through various mechanisms, such as buffering by seawater-derived bicarbonate sources (Truchot, 1979), and increased respiratory activity to reduce CO 2 loading of the extracellular fluid and nonbicarbonate buffering (Cameron, 1985;Hans et al., 2014;Michaelidis et al., 2005).Species with a developed capacity for ion exchange to maintain extracellular acid-base balance, are able to compensate for the effects of exposure to high pCO 2 waters and restore extracellular pH values optimal for physiological and biogeochemical processes (Somero, 1986).

        <p>However, the downside to the well-established extracellular acid-base control is an energetically demanding process (Hans et al., 2014;Michaelidis et al., 2005;Pane and Barry, 2007;Trigg et al., 2019). Therefore, we hypothesize that the internal carapace dissolution we observed in our study could be a part of a passive ability to buffer reductions in extracellular pH, a feature found in a variety of marine invertebrates including bivalves, echinoderms, and crustaceans (Cameron, 1985;Henry et al., 1981;Lindinger et al., 1984;Spicer and Taylor, 1987;Spicer et al., 2007).However, the downside to the well-established extracellular acid-base control is an energetically demanding process (Hans et al., 2014;Michaelidis et al., 2005;Pane and Barry, 2007;Trigg et al., 2019).

        <p>The narrow neuritic canals around the mechanoreceptors allow communication through secretion across the internal-external cuticle layers (Kunkel et al., 2012).While we currently have no information on the acid-base balance within these larval crabs under prolonged exposure to steep pCO 2 vertical gradients because no controlled experiments have been conducted, we propose future studies to examine if internal dissolution could provide some level of bicarbonate ions for buffering at comparatively low cost.The narrow neuritic canals around the mechanoreceptors allow communication through secretion across the internal-external cuticle layers (Kunkel et al., 2012).While we currently have no information on the acid-base balance within these larval crabs under prolonged exposure to steep pCO 2 vertical gradients because no controlled experiments have been conducted, we propose future studies to examine if internal dissolution could provide some level of bicarbonate ions for buffering at comparatively low cost.</p>
        <p>Alternative hypothesis for explaining internal dissolution might be based on the severity of external dissolution extending much deeper (Figure S4) to initiate the endocuticle dissolution.Alternative hypothesis for explaining internal dissolution might be based on the severity of external dissolution extending much deeper (Figure S4) to initiate the endocuticle dissolution.</p>
        <p>Once the dissolution of the external carapace dissolution is initiated, the mineralogical-elemental structure of the mid-and endocuticle can allow for more rapid progression. The presence of high-Mg 2+ content in the endocuticle can cause more rapid dissolution (Andersson et al., 2008), while comparatively lower Ca 2+ content on the outward side presumably results in a weaker carapace (Chen et al., 2008). In addition, chitin-proteinaceous matrix, such as an amorphous crystalline layer might be present, which could importantly contribute to additional dissolution.Once the dissolution of the external carapace dissolution is initiated, the mineralogical-elemental structure of the mid-and endocuticle can allow for more rapid progression.

        <p>Furthermore, while the internal solubility extent may be compensated by phosphorus, it can increase hardness, thereby preventing propagation of fractures, and Sr 2+ because it can replace Ca 2+ in the mineralization process (Dodd, 1964). In contrast, the observation of less internal dissolution on the endocuticle side compared to the external dissolution could be due to a difference in biomineral composition. For instance, intermixing calcite in the endocuticle with organic polymers would create a durable, protective covering, which may prevent the more soluble high-Mg calcite in the endocuticle from dissolving (Chen et al., 2008). However, we have no observations of dissolution penetration all the way from the external to the internal side, we thus propose an acid-base balance strategy to be more feasible explanation for the internal dissolution.Furthermore, while the internal solubility extent may be compensated by phosphorus, it can increase hardness, thereby preventing propagation of fractures, and Sr 2+ because it can replace Ca 2+ in the mineralization process (Dodd, 1964).

        <p>We suggest that the dissolution-length linkage could be explained by two different hypotheses:We suggest that the dissolution-length linkage could be explained by two different hypotheses:</p>
        <p>first, pronounced dissolution cal,60 vertical gradients results in dissolution rate outpacing calcification rate. In this mismatch of rates of two different processes, calcification rate cannot fully compensate for dissolution and results in overall smaller width ( the mismatch hypothesis).

In this form of the hypothesis, an organism expends additional energy to increase calcification to counteract dissolution, thus resulting in an energetic trade-off that potentially compromises organismal growth trade-off hypothesis).first, pronounced dissolution cal,60 vertical gradients results in dissolution rate outpacing calcification rate.

        <p>Furthermore, for early Dungeness crab life stages in the near-future, the prediction of more frequent and prolonged exposures to more severe cal,60 gradients (Turi et al., 2016) could have potentially deleterious consequences in terms of behavioral and sensory impairments and chelae function. First, dissolution-affected thinner structures may become too weak to retain their integrity, particularly under more severe conditions and continuous water flow, resulting in ridged, puffed surfaces. Morphological changes may in turn negatively impact larval survival by altering swimming behaviors and competence, including the ability to regulate buoyancy, maintain vertical position, and avoid predators (Morgan, 1989;Sulkin, 1984). Similar morphological structures as those observed in our study were noted in the larval form of the European lobster (Agnalt et al., 2013), which under prolonged exposure to OA conditions led to irreparable carapace deformities, and these could lead to an increase in molt-related mortalities (Small et al.,2016). Second, dissolution on both sides of carapace and pereopod exoskeleton will inevitably limit the effectiveness of the exoskeleton in providing support for muscles contraction and defense from predators, aiding homeostatic functions, and enabling feeding functions. Third, calcified neuritic canals appear to be one of the dissolution hotspots compromising setae function. Compared with undamaged setae at undissolved surfaces (Figures 6 andS2, S3), dissolved areas may not provide sufficient structural integrity for the setae (Figure 6), potentially impairing their functionality. Given the role of setae as mechanoreceptors directly involved in supporting crustacean sensory and behavior processes, we hypothesize that the absence or damage of setae within their neuritic canals may in part provide a mechanistic understanding for potential aberrant behavioral patterns found across various crustacean species under low OA conditions, such as slower movement, less tactile recognition, and prolonged searching time, as well as impaired swimming (Alenius and Munguia, 2012;Dissanayake and Ishimatsu, 2011) and behavioral choice (de la Haye et al., 2011). These changes can result in impaired competitiveness and altered predator-prey relationships for crabs (de la Haye et al., 2012;Dodd et al., 2015;Landes and Zimmer, 2012;Wang et al., 2018). Fourth, it is currently unknown whether external dissolution in megalopae could carry over into later life stages, including the reproductively active adult stage, and what the potential consequences may be for the population dynamics.Furthermore, for early Dungeness crab life stages in the near-future, the prediction of more frequent and prolonged exposures to more severe cal,60 gradients (Turi et al., 2016) could have potentially deleterious consequences in terms of behavioral and sensory impairments and chelae function.

        <p>However, reduced calcification could result in poor mineralization through the intermolt period that would be especially devastating for larval crabs because of potentially smaller sizes at maturity, as well as increased vulnerability to predation during their most sensitive molting stage.However, reduced calcification could result in poor mineralization through the intermolt period that would be especially devastating for larval crabs because of potentially smaller sizes at maturity, as well as increased vulnerability to predation during their most sensitive molting stage.</p>
        <p>While OA parameters largely affect observed biominerological and organismal responses, population-level responses (i.e. abundances) are driven by food availability, with a lesser role for temperature in the near-shore conditions. Although biological responses at different levels of biological organization appear to be decoupled and responded to different drivers across temporal and spatial scales that need to be taken into account to improve biological forecasts and predictions. The only driver that seem to resonate across individual and population level, at least marginally, is the temperature, which might have an opposite effect on both levels. While warmer temperature negatively affects abundances, it also reduces internal dissolution, although the latter is only a marginally significant.While OA parameters largely affect observed biominerological and organismal responses, population-level responses (i.e. abundances) are driven by food availability, with a lesser role for temperature in the near-shore conditions.

        <p>To more accurately predict large-scale vulnerability, it is important to consider population connectivity, related to essential population vital rates and affected by dispersal (Lowe and Allendorf, 2010). This can be partitioned into genetic connectivity and demographic connectivity, with our model outputs demonstrating onshore-offshore connectivity along the shelf-coastal and in the northern-southern directions. This implies prolonged exposure to less suitable habitats characterized by low cal,60 in the nearshore areas that can exacerbate negative biological effects but some of them could be counteracted by higher food availability. With respect to genetic connectivity, the status of Dungeness crab as a high gene-flow species with low genetic differentiation along the US West Coast and the lack of significant adaptation patterns (Jackson and , 2017;Jackson et al., 2018;O'Malley et al., 2017) implies that the genetic pool that might allow for adaptation under future climate scenario will be limited.To more accurately predict large-scale vulnerability, it is important to consider population connectivity, related to essential population vital rates and affected by dispersal (Lowe and Allendorf, 2010).

        <p>Like dissolution in pteropods, larval dissolution observed in Dungeness crab is clear evidence that marine invertebrates are damaged by extended exposure to strong present-day OA-related vertical gradients in their natural environment. The unexplored aspect of OA impacts related to the damaged mechanoreceptors and potentially impaired sensory functions needs to be explored further. Namely, if the sensory functions are impaired, the transitioning from the larval to juvenile stage in their coastal habitat might be compromised under predicted scenarios of steeper pH cal,60 gradients (Gruber et al., 2012;Turi et al., 2016). Multiple pathways of larval vulnerability should be studied in the context of carry-over effects to the next juvenile benthic stage to explore whether crustacean molting can offset some of the detrimental effects. Such findings should be integrated into a population demographic and exposure history model that could eventually lead to improved management of Dungeness crab stocks (Fernandes et al., 2017;Lam et al., 2016).Like dissolution in pteropods, larval dissolution observed in Dungeness crab is clear evidence that marine invertebrates are damaged by extended exposure to strong present-day OA-related vertical gradients in their natural environment.
