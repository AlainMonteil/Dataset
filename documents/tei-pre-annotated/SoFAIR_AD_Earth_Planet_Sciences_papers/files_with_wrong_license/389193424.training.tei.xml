        <p>We use Planck 2018 data to constrain the simplest models of scalar-tensor theories characterized by a coupling to the Ricci scalar of the type F (σ)R with F (σ) = N 2 pl + ξσ 2 . We update our results with previous Planck and BAO data releases obtaining the tightest constraints to date on the coupling parameters, that is ξ &lt; 5.5 × 10 -4 for N pl = 0 (induced gravity or equivalently extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke) and (N pl √ 8πG) -1 &lt; 1.8 × 10 -5 for ξ = -1/6 (conformal coupling), both at 95% CL. Because of a modified expansion history after radiation-matter equality compared to the ΛCDM model, all these dynamical models accommodate a higher value for H 0 and therefore alleviate the tension between Planck /BAO and distance-ladder measurement from SNe Ia data from 4.4σ at best to 2.7-3.2σ with CMB alone and 3.5-3.6σ including BAO data. We show that all these results are robust to changes in the neutrino physics. In comparison to the ΛCDM model, partial degeneracies between</p>
        <p>The distance-ladder measurement of the Hubble constant from supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) [1,2] and from strong-lensing time delays [3][4][5] disagrees with the value inferred from the fit of the cosmic microwaves background (CMB) anisotropies [6,7]. In particular, the value inferred using the Planck legacy data for a flat ΛCDM cosmological model, H 0 = (67.36 ± 0.54) km s -1 Mpc -1 [7], is in a 4.4σ tension with the most recent measurement from the SH0ES team [8], that is H 0 = (74.03 ± 1.42) km s -1 Mpc -1 , determined using Cepheidcalibrated SNe Ia with new parallax measurements from HST spatial scanning [2] and from Gaia DR2 [9], in a 3.2σ tension with the strong-lensing time delay determination from the H0LiCOW collaboration [5], that is H 0 = 73.3 +1. 7 -1.8 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and in a 5.3σ tension with the combined SH0ES + H0LiCOW value H 0 = (73.8 ± 1.1) km s -1 Mpc -1 [5].</p>
        <p>Although it does not seem possible to completely solve the discrepancy between CMB and local measurements by considering unaccounted systematic effects [10][11][12], revisions of the determination of the Hubble rate based on the Cepheid calibration [13][14][15], and from SNe Ia calibrated using the tip of the red giant branch method [16] point to values which are still higher than the Planck measurements, i.e. ∼ 70 km s -1 Mpc -1 , but to a smaller extent (see however [17][18][19][20][21] for more recent developments).</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the H 0 tension can be addressed by evoking new physics beyond the ΛCDM concordance model, either in the late or early time Universe [22,23]. Late-time modifications include a phantom-like dark energy (DE) component [24][25][26], a vacuum phase JCAP10(2020)044 transition [27][28][29][30][31], interacting dark energy [32][33][34][35][36], or quintessence in a non-flat Universe [37]. However, these models are tightly constrained [1,25,33,38] by late-time observational data, especially those from baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) [39][40][41].</p>
        <p>With the highly precisely determined angular scale of the last-scattering surface (LSS) [42], it has been suggested that a smaller value of the comoving sound horizon at baryon drag r s can provide a higher value of H 0 without spoiling the CMB angular power spectrum measurements and without changing the BAO observables [23,43]. An example of such an early-time modification is the extension to additional light relics, eventually interacting with hidden dark sectors [44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51]. Another promising early-time solution, is an exotic early dark energy (EDE) component that remains subdominant for the majority of the cosmological evolution of the Universe and injects a small amount of energy in a very narrow redshift window [52][53][54][55][56][57]. Note that features in the primordial power spectrum [58,59] and modifications of the recombination history [60,61] are not able to increase H 0 .</p>
        <p>Another interesting possibility is to alleviate the H 0 tension through a modification of General Relativity (GR) [62][63][64][65][66][67][68][69][70][71], which can include early-and late-time modifications of the expansion history with respect to ΛCDM. Scalar-tensor theories of gravity that involve a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar naturally change the effective relativistic degrees of freedom in the radiation-dominated epoch and the background expansion history from ΛCDM, thus leading to a higher CMB-inferred H 0 [62,63,66]. This has been shown for the extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke (eJBD) model in refs. [62,63] where the cosmological parameters estimation has been carried out using data from the Planck 2013 and 2015 release respectively. The robustness of a higher H 0 in these theories has been proved in ref. [66], where a more general form of the non-minimal coupling (NMC) to gravity has been considered. In this paper, we confirm earlier results for the particular cases of eJBD and a conformally coupled (CC) scalar field using the most recent cosmological data.</p>
        <p>Since the mechanism that drives a higher inferred H 0 relies on the radiation-like behavior of the scalar field at early times, it is interesting to investigate to what extent these simple scalar-tensor theories are degenerate with effective number of relativistic species due to neutrinos and to any additional massless particles produced well before recombination N eff . The current tight constraints from the latest Planck 2018 data N eff = 2.89 ± 0.19 (N eff = 2.99 ± 0.17 including BAO) at 68% CL [7] can be changed in modified gravity theories as previously shown in the context of f (R) gravity in [72,73].</p>
        <p>While changing N eff can lead to a higher value for H 0 compared with the value inferred in the ΛCDM model from the CMB anisotropies measurements, in the extension of ΛCDM model with non-zero total neutrino mass m ν , lower values of H 0 correspond to higher values of m ν and higher values of H 0 correspond to lower m ν . For instance, the constraint from Planck 2018 data in combination with BAO data is m ν &lt; 0.12 eV at 95% CL [7,74] and combining with the measurement from the SH0ES team the limit further tightens to m ν &lt; 0.076 eV [75]. In scalar-tensor theories of gravity, it is possible to keep fixed the angular diameter distance at decoupling or even increase it in order to recover a higher H 0 while increasing the total neutrino mass value [76]. Given that neutrino oscillations are the only laboratory evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics [77], it is natural to ask ourselves either how the cosmological constraints on neutrino physics can be relaxed in these simple models of scalar-tensor theories compared to the ΛCDM concordance model and how much constraints become larger in the NMC models including the neutrino parameters.</p>
        <p>Future CMB experiments, such as the Simons Observatoryfoot_0 [78], CMB-S4foot_1 [79], and future LSS surveys from DESIfoot_2 [80], Euclidfoot_3 [81,82], LSST 5 [83], SKA 6 [84, 85] will help to improve the constraints on these extended cosmologies [86][87][88] and limit the degeneracy of neutrino parameters N eff and m ν with scalar-tensor theories [89].</p>
        <p>The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to a description of the models considered. We describe the datasets considered in section 3. In in section 4, we start by discussing the updated constraints on the eJBD and CC model in light of new CMB and BAO data, then we discuss the combination with the distance-ladder measure of H 0 from SNe Ia in section 5. We further improve the analysis by extending the cosmological parameters to the ones describing the neutrino sector in sections 6.1-6.2-6.3. We draw our conclusions in section 7. In appendix A, we collect all the tables with the constraints on the cosmological parameters obtained with our MCMC analysis.</p>
        <p>As far as cosmological tests are concerned, one of workhorse models to test deviations from GR is the eJBD [90,91] theory, which has been extensively studied [62,63,67,[92][93][94][95][96][97]. NMC eJBD theory is perhaps the simplest extension to GR within the more general Horndeski theory [98]:</p>
        <p>where F (σ) = N 2 pl + ξσ 2 , R is the Ricci scalar, and L m is the Lagrangian density for matter fields. As in [66], we do not consider a quintessence-like inverse power-law potential (see for instance [99][100][101][102][103]), but we restrict ourselves to a potential of the type V (σ) = λF 2 (σ)/4 for which the scalar field is effectively massless. Our choice reduces to eJBD theory after the redefinition σ 2 = φ/(8πξ), ξ = 1/(4ω BD ), and setting N pl = 0.</p>
        <p>For a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe with ds 2 = -dt 2 + a 2 (t)dx 2 , the background Friedmann equations in the Jordan frame are [104]:</p>
        <p>These equations are supplemented by the Klein-Gordon equation that governs the evolution of the scalar field:</p>
        <p>The coupling between gravity and the scalar degree of freedom induces a time varying Newton's gravitational constant G N , which is given by G N = 1/(8πF ). This quantity is usually denoted by the cosmological Newton's gravitational constant, as opposed to the one that is actually measured in laboratory Cavendish-type experiments which is rather given by [104]:</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>(2.5)</p>
        <p>Deviations from GR for a theory of gravitation are parameterized by the so called post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the metric [105]. In such an expansion, the line element can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>where we have retained only the two non-null contributions to the PN expansion in the case of NMC theories, that is [104]</p>
        <p>(2.7)</p>
        <p>Solar-system experiments agree with GR preditions, for which both γ PN and β PN are identically equal to unity, at a very precise level. Measurements of the perihelion shift of Mercury constrain β PN -1 = (4.1 ± 7.8) × 10 -5 at 68% CL [105] and Shapiro time delay constrains</p>
        <p>3) × 10 -5 at 68% CL [106].</p>
        <p>In this paper we restrict ourselves to two simple models, both of which only contain one extra parameter with respect to the ΛCDM model: induced gravity (IG) described by N pl = 0 and ξ &gt; 0, and a conformally coupled scalar field (CC) for which ξ = -1/6 and the free parameter is N pl &gt; M pl . For both models, the effective value of the Newton's gravitational constant G N decreases with time, whereas the scalar field σ increases for ξ &gt; 0, e.g. for IG, and it decreases for ξ &lt; 0, e.g. for CC. 7 We have γ PN &lt; 1 and β PN ≤ 1 for ξ &gt; 0 (β PN = 1 for IG), whereas γ PN &lt; 1 and β PN &gt; 1 for ξ &lt; 0.</p>
        <p>In order to connect the present value of the field σ 0 ≡ σ(z = 0) to the gravitational constant, we impose the condition G eff (σ 0 ) = G, where G = 6.67 × 10 -foot_7 cm 3 g -1 s -2 is the gravitational constant measured in a Cavendish-type experiment. This corresponds to</p>
        <p>for IG and</p>
        <p>for the CC case. For simplicity, we denote quantities normalized to M pl ≡ 1/ √ 8πG with a tilde.</p>
        <p>In order to derive the constraints on the cosmological parameters we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis by using the publicly available code 
            <rs type="software">MontePython</rs>
            <rs type="version">8</rs> [108,109] connected to our modified version of the code 
            <rs type="software">CLASSfoot_8</rs> [110,111], i.e. CLASSig [62]. Mean values and uncertainties on the parameters reported, as well as the contours plotted, have been obtained using 
            <rs type="software">GetDistfoot_9</rs> [112]. We use adiabatic initial conditions for the scalar field perturbations [66,113].
        </p>
        <p>As baseline, we vary the six cosmological parameters for a flat ΛCDM concordance model, i.e. ω b , ω c , H 0 , τ , ln 10 10 A s , n s , plus one extra parameter related to the coupling to the Ricci curvature. For IG (N pl = 0, ξ &gt; 0), we sample on the quantity ζ IG ≡ ln (1 + 4ξ), according to [62,63,96] in the prior range [0, 0.039]. For CC (N pl &gt; M pl , ξ = -1/6), we sample on ∆ Ñpl ≡ Ñpl -1, according to [66], with prior range [0, 0.5]. In our updated analysis in section 4 we assume 3 massless neutrino with N eff = 3.046, but a more general neutrino sector is considered in the rest of the paper.</p>
        <p>We quote constraints on the variation of the Newton's gravitational constant between the radiation era and the present time δG N /G N , and its derivative at present time ĠN /G N . Defining the effective cosmological gravitational strength [95]:</p>
        <p>we have</p>
        <p>ĠN</p>
        <p>for IG and</p>
        <p>ĠN</p>
        <p>for the CC case, where δG N /G N , ĠN /G N = 0 and G N /G = 1 correspond to the predictions in GR. We also list the ∆χ 2 ≡ χ 2χ 2 ΛCDM , where negative values indicate a better-fit to the datasets with respect to the ΛCDM model.</p>
        <p>We constrain the cosmological parameters using several combination of datasets. Our CMB measurements are those from the Planck 2018 legacy release (hereafter P18) on temperature, polarization, and weak lensing CMB anisotropies angular power spectra [114,115]. The high-multipoles likelihood ≥ 30 is based on Plik likelihood. We use the low-likelihood combination at 2 ≤ &lt; 30: temperature-only Commander likelihood plus the SimAll EE-only likelihood. For the Planck CMB lensing likelihood, we consider the conservative multipoles range, i.e. 8 ≤ ≤ 400. We marginalize over foreground and calibration nuisance parameters of the Planck likelihoods [114,115] which are also varied together with the cosmological ones.</p>
        <p>Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from galaxy redshift surveys are used as primary astrophysical dataset to constraint these class of theories providing a complementary late-time information to the CMB anisotropies. We use the Baryon Spectroscopic</p>

Right panel: marginalized joint 68% and 95% CL regions 2D parameter space using P18 (gray) in combination with BAO (blue) and BAO + R19 (red) for the IG model.</p>
        <p>Survey (BOSS) DR12 [41] consensus results on BAOs in three redshift slices with effective redshifts z eff = 0.38, 0.51, 0.61 [116][117][118], in combination with measure from 6dF [39] at z eff = 0.106 and the one from SDSS DR7 [40] at z eff = 0.15. Finally, we consider the combination with a Gaussian likelihood based on the determination of the Hubble constant from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations (hereafter R19), i.e. H 0 = (74.03 ± 1.42) km s -1 Mpc -1 [8].</p>
        <p>The results in this section update those obtained in ref. [63] for IG and in ref. [66] for CC, based on the Planck 2015 data (P15) [119,120] in combination with an older compilation of BAO data, i.e. DR10-DR11 [39,40,122].</p>
        <p>First, we discuss the IG case. We find that the constraint on the coupling parameter ξ obtained from the CMB alone is almost half of the bound obtained with P15 which was ξ &lt; 0.0017 at 95% CL. With the full high-polarization information and the new determination of τ we obtain ξ &lt; 0.00098 at 95% CL. Adding the BAO data, we obtain ξ &lt; 0.00055 at 95% CL, which is 25% tighter compared to the limit obtained with P15 in combination with BAO DR10-11, i.e. ξ &lt; 0.00075 and half of the one obtained with P13 in combination with BAO DR10-11, i.e. ξ &lt; 0.0012, see the left panel of figure 1. As we can see from table 1, BAO data strongly constrain the model and are useful to break the degeneracy in the H 0ξ parameter space.</p>
        <p>We now discuss the CC case. The coupling to gravity is constrained to N pl &lt; 1.000028 M pl at 95% CL for P18 and N pl &lt; 1.000018 M pl at 95% CL in combination with BAO data. These constraints update the ones obtained with P15 in combination with D10-DR11 BAO N pl &lt; 1.000038 M pl at 95% CL in ref. [66]. As in the IG case, we still have a degeneracy between H 0 and the coupling to gravity N pl as visible from figure 2. For these NMC models we recover the same cosmological parameters and uncertainties if we allow ξ JCAP10(2020)044 to vary, with prior range [0, 0.1] and [-0.1, 0], together with N pl . We find for the positive branch (N pl &lt; M pl , ξ &gt; 0) of the coupling:</p>
        <p>both at 95% CL and H 0 = 68.78 +0.56 -0.84 km s -1 Mpc -1 (70.14 +0.86 -0.72 km s -1 Mpc -1 ) with P18+BAO (P18+BAO+R19). The constraints for the negative branch (N pl &gt; M pl , ξ &lt; 0) are:</p>
        <p>both at 95% CL and H 0 = 68.76 +0.54 -0.78 km s -1 Mpc -1 (69.74 ± 0.75 km s -1 Mpc -1 ) with P18+BAO (P18+BAO+R19).</p>
        <p>Consistently with the constraints on the coupling parameters ξ and N pl , we find also tighter limits on the variation of the Newton's gravitational constant (3.2)-(3.5) and its derivative (3.3)-(3.6) at present time. For IG, we have:</p>
        <p>for P18 + BAO at 95% CL, updating those obtained in ref. [63] with P15 + BAO DR10-11, i.e.</p>
        <p>For CC, we obtain the following 95% CL bounds for P18 + BAO:</p>
        <p>Note that whereas the constraints on δG N /G N (z = 0) hardly change for different coupling F (σ), the limits on ĠN /G N (z = 0) strongly depend on the details of the model, 11</p>
        <p>Figure 3. Left panel: marginalized joint 68% and 95% CL regions 2D parameter space H 0ξ using P18 + BAO data for IG with V (σ) = λF (σ) 2 /4 (red) and V (σ) = Λ (blue). Right panel: marginalized joint 68% and 95% CL regions 2D parameter space H 0 -N pl using P18 + BAO data for CC with</p>
        <p>anyway much tighter than those obtained by the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment [121]. Table 1 also reports the values of the post-Newtonian parameters as derived parameters from our samples: whereas for IG γ PN O(10 -3 ), for CC the bounds we derive on γ PN , β PN are now tighter than those in the Solar System. We note that the value of the initial (final) scalar field is small and sub-Planckian σ ini = (0.22 ± 0.10) M pl (σ 0 = (0.0089 ± 0.0040) M pl ) as opposed to the IG case where the evolution is super-Planckian.</p>
        <p>We have tested that our results are stable when we switch to a flat potential V (σ) = Λ for both IG and CC. We show in figure 3 the consistency of the posterior distributions for H 0 , ξ, and N pl with current cosmological data (P18 + BAO). The comparison with V (σ) = Λ for IG updates the results obtained in [63] with Planck 2015 which showed that the cosmological parameters were stable when varying the index n of a power-law potential V (σ) = λσ n /4 with n ≥ 0. The stability of the results for the CC case when switching to V (σ) = Λ is a new result, although, in analogy with what happens in IG, not totally unexpected since our data constrains the deviations O(σ 2 /N 2 pl ) of F 2 from a flat potential. We refer the interested reader to ref. [71] for an extended analysis of</p>
        <p>] with n = 2, 4 with flat priors on σ ini . 125 Implications for the H 0 tension and combination with R19 data</p>
        <p>We find a higher value for the Hubble parameter for IG, i.e. H 0 = 69.6 +0.8 -1.7 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and for CC, i.e. H 0 = 69.0 +0.7 -1.2 km s -1 Mpc -1 , compared to the ΛCDM case, i.e. H 0 = (67.36 ± 0.54) km s -1 Mpc -1 , for P18.</p>
        <p>The addition of BAO drives the value for H 0 to lower values, for IG to H 0 = 68.78 +0.53 -0.78 km s -1 Mpc -1 and for CC to H 0 = 68.62 +0.47 -0.66 km s -1 Mpc -1 . Note however that these values are larger than the corresponding ΛCDM value, i.e. H 0 = (67.66 ± 0.42) km s -1 Mpc -1 . Once we include R19, we obtain H 0 = (70.1 ± 0.8) km s -1 Mpc -1 at 68% CL, ξ = 0.00051 +0.00043 -0.00046 at 95% CL for IG, H 0 = 69.64 +0.65 -0.73 km s -1 Mpc -1 at 68% CL, N pl &lt; 1.000031 M pl at 95% CL for CC. Figure 1 shows how the degeneracy between H 0 and ξ can easily accommodate for larger H 0 value with respect to the ΛCDM concordance model reducing the H 0 tension from 4.4σ to 2.7σ (3.2σ) for P18 and 3.5σ (3.6σ) including BAO for IG (CC). The reduction of the tension is due to the combination of having an higher mean and larger uncertainties on H 0 compared to the ΛCDM model. We find that H 0 is about ∼ 0.5 km s -1 Mpc -1 higher in the IG compared to the CC case for every choice of datasets combination.</p>
        <p>Note that the models considered in our paper can produce a values of H 0 in complete agreement with the local value of H 0 measured using red giants [16], though not that measured using SNe Ia [8].</p>
        <p>6 Degeneracy with the neutrino sector</p>
        <p>The presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the Universe increases the expansion rate during the radiation-dominated era and shifts the epoch of matter-radiation equality, the shape of the matter power spectrum, and the history of recombination (see refs. [123,124] for a review). The extra radiation is usually parameterized by ∆N eff ≡ N eff -3.046 which takes into account that neutrino decoupling was not quite complete when e + e -annihilation began [125][126][127][128].</p>
        <p>In the context of the H 0 tension, a larger value of N eff can attenuate the discrepancy on the H 0 value and reduce the comoving sound horizon at baryon drag. However, the tension is only reduced (∼ 2σ) and it appears again when BAO data is included [7,43].</p>
        <p>There is an interplay (negative correlation) between the contribution of extra radiation with respect to the standard ΛCDM scenario from the N eff and from the scalar field cou-JCAP10(2020)044 pling 13 which acts as an additional source of radiation in the early Universe. Decreasing the effective number of extra relativistic species to N eff = 2.846 we obtain deviations of the CMB anisotropies angular power spectra to the ΛCDM model of the same order of the ones obtained with ξ halved and N eff = 3.046, see figure 4. We see that, preferring lower values of N eff , the dataset allows for larger values for ξ compared to the case with N eff = 3.046 fixed. We go from ξ &lt; 0.00098 to ξ &lt; 0.0019 at 95% CL with P18 alone and from ξ &lt; 0.00055 to ξ &lt; 0.00078 once we include BAO, see table 3.</p>
        <p>The mean of N eff moves around 1σ toward lower values with respect to the ΛCDM case with a similar error. For IG, we get at 68% CL N eff = 2.79 ± 0.20 for P18 compared to N eff = 2.89 ± 0.19 in ΛCDM and N eff = 2.85 ± 0.17 in combination with BAO compared to N eff = 2.99 ± 0.17 in ΛCDM. In figure 5 (central panel), we show the enlarged H 0 -N eff parameter space in IG compared to the ΛCDM concordance model (green contours) where it is possible to reach higher value of H 0 without increasing N eff in presence of a modification of gravity.</p>
        <p>In the CC model, an analogous correlation in the N eff -N pl parameter space is found, see figure 6. The constraints on N pl are larger, from N pl &lt; 1.000028 M pl to N pl &lt; 1.000057</p>
        <p>M pl at 95% CL with P18 alone and from N pl &lt; 1.000018 M pl to N pl &lt; 1.000019 M pl at 95% CL once we include BAO, see table 4.</p>
        <p>While for the combination P18 + BAO we find a higher value for the Hubble parameter for IG, i.e. H 0 = 68.78 +0. 53 -0.78 km s -1 Mpc -1 , and for CC, i.e. H 0 = 68.62 +0.47 -0.66 km s -1 Mpc -1 , compared to the ΛCDM+N eff case, i.e. H 0 = (67.3 ± 1.1) km s -1 Mpc -1 , the addition of R19 data leads to a closer posterior distribution for H 0 among the three cases, i.e. (70.1 ± 0.8) km s -1 Mpc -1 for IG, (69.6 ± 0.7) km s -1 Mpc -1 for CC, and H 0 = (70.0 ± 0.9) km s -1 Mpc -1 for ΛCDM+N eff . We find a similar posterior distribution also for IG+N eff (CC+N eff ), i.e. (70.3 ± 0.9) km s -1 Mpc -1 ((70.1 ± 0.9) km s -1 Mpc -1 ), see figure 5.</p>
        <p>The addition of BAO data reduces the degeneracy H 0ξ (-N pl ) increasing the one between N effξ (-N pl ) and H 0 -N eff . In order to reduce comoving sound horizon to accommodate a larger value of H 0 , in this case N eff is moved towards larger values, i.e. 3.11 ± 0.19 for IG and 3.16 ± 0.19 for CC, see table 3.</p>
        <p>The changes in the background evolution caused by neutrino mass, under standard assumptions and for a fixed set of standard cosmological parameters, are confined to late times. In particular, the neutrino mass impact the angular diameter distance and z Λ (the redshift of matter-to-cosmological-constant equality) (see refs. [123,124,[129][130][131][132][133] for a review on neutrino mass in cosmology).</p>
        <p>In the standard ΛCDM scenario, a larger value of m ν results in a lower Hubble rate inferred from the CMB, exacerbating the H 0 tension. However, there is partial correlation between the equation of state of dark energy (DE) w and the total neutrino mass m ν , as first noticed by [130]. When m ν is increased (or more generally Ω ν ), Ω m can be kept unchanged, by simultaneously decreasing w, in order to keep the angular diameter distance at decoupling fixed. In this case, the impact of neutrino mass on the background is confined to variations of z Λ and of the late-time ISW effect.</p>
        <p>Cosmological bounds on the neutrino masses can therefore be relaxed by using a DE component rather than a cosmological constant. Vice versa, cosmological constraints on the DE parameters become larger in comparison to cosmologies with massless neutrinos or with the standard minimal assumption of m ν = 0.06 eV. The same conclusions have been obtained in the context of Galileon gravity [76].</p>
        <p>We show in figure 7 the combined effect on the CMB anisotropies of varying both ξ and m ν in the IG model. For a fixed value of the coupling parameter ξ = 0.0008, the differences with respect to the ΛCDM concordance model are reduced by increasing the value of the neutrino mass m ν from 0.1 eV to 0.3 eV. On the late-time observables, i.e. the weak lensing CMB anisotropies and the linear matter power spectrum, the partial degeneracy between modified gravity and the neutrino mass is still present but with differences concentrated on small scales, see figure 8.</p>
        <p>In this case the constraints on the coupling parameter ξ become tighter compared to the case with m ν = 0, i.e. from ξ &lt; 0.00098 to ξ &lt; 0.00094 at 95% CL for P18. 14 The CMB anisotropies data prefer to relax the upper bound on the neutrino mass which becomes m ν &lt; 0.31 eV at 95% CL for P18 29% larger to the ΛCDM case m ν &lt; 0.24 eV. Including the BAO data, the total neutrino mass is constrained to m ν &lt; 0.17 eV at 95% CL, 42% larger to the ΛCDM case m ν &lt; 0.12 eV, and we find ξ &lt; 0.00076 at 95% CL, see table 5. The JCAP10(2020)044 addition of R19 data leads to H 0 = (70.1 ± 0.8) km s -1 Mpc -1 with an upper bound on the total neutrino mass m ν &lt; 0.19 eV at 95% CL, 2.5 times larger than the limit based on the ΛCDM model, with a 2σ detection of the coupling parameter ξ = 0.00065 ± 0.00057 at 95% CL, see figure 9.</p>
        <p>Analogously, for CC the constraint on N pl becomes tighter compared to the case with m ν = 0, i.e. N pl &lt; 1.000026 M pl for P18 and N pl &lt; 1.000024 M pl for P18 + BAO at 95% CL, see figure 10. Also, for this model, the upper bound on the neutrino mass becomes 30% larger compared to the ΛCDM case, see table Figure 10. Marginalized joint 68% and CL regions 2D parameter space using P18 (gray) in combination with BAO (blue) and BAO + R19 (red) for the CC+m ν model.</p>
        <p>Finally, we consider the case where both N eff and m ν are allowed to vary. Despite the larger parameter space and the larger limits on the parameters, the models do not accommodate higher values of the Hubble parameter compared to the 7-and 8-parameters case analysed before, see figures 11-12. Moreover, the total neutrino mass is almost uncorrelated with the Hubble parameter. In this case, the modified gravity parameters ξ and N pl are always compatible at 2σ with the GR limit due to the larger parameter space and are given by (see tables 7-8): for the CC case. Adding also R19, we obtain ξ &lt; 0.0013 (95% CL) , N eff = 3.08 ± 0.20 , m ν &lt; 0.19 eV (95% CL)</p>
        <p>for IG and</p>
        <p>for the CC case.</p>
        <p>We have studied the simplest class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity where Newton's constant is allowed to vary in time and space. These non-minimally coupled theories are characterized by a coupling to the Ricci scalar R of the type F (σ) = N 2 pl + ξσ 2 , which contain the induced gravity [138][139][140] model for N pl = 0 and ξ &gt; 0, and the conformal coupling model [66] for ξ = -1/6. These models contribute to the radiation density budget in the JCAP10(2020)044 radiation-dominated epoch and change the background expansion history compared to the ΛCDM concordance model naturally alleviating the H 0 tension.</p>
        <p>Compared to previous constraints [63,66], the improvement of Planck 2018 polarization data lead to tighter results, i.e. ξ &lt; 0.00098 and N pl &lt; 1.000028 M pl both at 95% CL. When BAO data from BOSS DR12 are added, we obtain tighter limits, i.e. ξ &lt; 0.00055 and N pl &lt; 1.000018 M pl . For ξ = -1/6, P18 and BAO data lead to constraints on the post-Newtonian parameters which are tighter than those derived within the Solar System.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that for CMB and BAO data these models allow for values of H 0 larger than ΛCDM. Using P18 data, we find H 0 = 69.6 +0.8 -1.7 km s -1 Mpc -1 (H 0 = 69.0 +0.7 -1.2 km s -1 Mpc -1 ) for the IG (CC) case compared to H 0 = (67.36 ± 0.54) km s -1 Mpc -1 for ΛCDM, alleviating the tension from 4.4σ to 2.7σ (3.2σ) for P18 and 3.5σ (3.6σ) including BAO for IG (CC).</p>
        <p>Including BAO and R19, we obtain H 0 = (70.06 ± 0.81) km s -1 Mpc -1 (H 0 = 69.64 +0. 65 -0.73 km s -1 Mpc -1 ) for IG (for CC). The value for H 0 we find is similar to what can be obtained in other models which aim to solve the H 0 tension, but the models considered here have just one extra parameter as ΛCDM+N eff . Similar valus of H 0 can also be found for NMC beyond the IG and CC cases considered here [71].</p>
        <p>We have extended our analysis to a general neutrino sector by allowing the effective number of relativistic species N eff and the neutrino mass m ν to vary. Both N eff and m ν are partially degenerate with the deviations from GR, as happens in other modified gravity models [72,73,76]. Whereas N eff and the scalar field act as an additional source of radiation in the early Universe, at late times the background contribution to Ω m due to m ν can be compensated from the scalar field in order to keep the angular diameter distance at decoupling fixed, see figures 4-7-8. We have shown however that these are only partial degeneracies which could be broken by combination of observations at different redshifts.</p>
        <p>In case with N eff (section 6.1) the limit on ξ becomes ∼ 94% (∼ 42%) larger with P18 (P18+BAO) while the mean on the number of neutrinos moves around 1σ towards lower values compared to the ΛCDM case without significantly degrading its uncertainty, i.e. N eff = 2.79±0.20 (N eff = 2.85±0.17). For CC the limit on N pl becomes ∼ 104% (∼ 6%) larger with P18 (P18+BAO) and analogously to IG we find N eff = 2.73 +0. 25 -0.22 (N eff = 2.81 ± 0.19). The upper bound on the neutrino mass (section 6.2) is ∼ 29% (∼ 42%) is also degraded with P18 (P18+BAO) compared to the ΛCDM case, i.e. m ν &lt; 0.31 eV (m ν &lt; 0.17 eV), whereas the constraint on ξ is slightly tighter with CMB data alone in order to relax the constraint on m ν . Analogously, for CC the limit on the neutrino mass is ∼ 17% (∼ 33%) larger with P18 (P18+BAO) compared to the ΛCDM case. When both N eff and m ν are allowed to vary, we see that the constraints on ξ and N pl degrade by a factor two compared to the case with N eff = 3.046 and m ν = 0 eV also in presence of BAO data, i.e. ξ &lt; 0.0012 and N pl &lt; 1.000042 M pl at 95% CL. For the data used, the combination of the modification to gravity in our models to non-standard neutrino physics does not lead to higher values of H 0 compared to the case with standard assumptions in the neutrino sector.</p>
