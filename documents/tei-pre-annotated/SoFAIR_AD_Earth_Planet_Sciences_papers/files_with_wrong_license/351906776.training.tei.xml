        <p>The dynamics of magma deep in the Earth's crust are difficult to capture by geophysical monitoring. Since May 2018, a seismically quiet area offshore of Mayotte, in the Comoros archipelago, has been affected by a complex seismic sequence, including long-duration, very long period signals recorded globally. A large surface deflation has also been recorded by GNSS stations on Mayotte. Here we systematically analyse regional and global seismic and deformation data to provide a one year long detailed picture of a deep, rare magmatic process. We identify about 7000 volcano-tectonic earthquakes and 407 very long period signals. Early earthquakes migrated upward in response to a magmatic dyke propagating from Moho depth to the surface, while later events marked the progressive failure of the roof of a magma reservoir, triggering its resonance. An analysis of the very long period seismicity and deformation suggests that a 25-35 km deep reservoir of 10-15 km diameter has lost at least 1.3 km 3 of magma. We demonstrate that such deep offshore magmatic activity can be captured without any on-site monitoring.The dynamics of magma deep in the Earth's crust are difficult to capture by geophysical monitoring.

        <p>In May-June 2018, global earthquake monitoring agencies detected a series of large earthquakes in an otherwise relatively quiet area ~35 km east of the island of Mayotte. A peak M W 5.9 1 earthquake occurred on 15 May 2018, the largest ever recorded in the region. In November 2018 long-duration (~20 minutes) very long period seismic signals (VLPs) with periods of ~16 s were discovered in global seismic recordings 1 , triggering the curiosity of the scientific community. The origin of the VLPs was traced back in the vicinity of the swarm activity close to Mayotte. Most often, VLP signals 2 are recorded in volcanic areas 3 suggesting a magmatic origin for the sequence.In May-June 2018, global earthquake monitoring agencies detected a series of large earthquakes in an otherwise relatively quiet area ~35 km east of the island of Mayotte.

        <p>Mayotte is one of the four principal volcanic islands in the Comoros archipelago and home to a population of ~256,000 (2017). The island belongs to a 250 km long NW-SE chain of basaltic volcanoes located between Africa and Madagascar (Fig. 1). The region has been affected by multiple tectonic processes 4, 5 including an episode of NE-SW trend rifting during the Permo-Triassic, associated with the fragmentation of Gondwana 6, 7 and the formation of the Somali and Mozambique oceanic basins, during which Madagascar drifted southwards [8][9][10][11][12] . Proposed sources of volcanism include hotspot 13 , passive magma ascent through lithospheric discontinuities 14 or rifting coeval to rifting in Southern East Africa 15 . Volcanism at Mayotte started at about 10-20 Ma [15][16] and subsequently migrated to produce the other islands. Mayotte last erupted 4000±500 years ago 15 . The nature of the crust and its thickness beneath the Comoro Islands is debated [14][15] . Only a few M &gt; 4 earthquakes have been recorded in this area, including the 1993 Mb 5.2 event, which caused ~1.7 M Euros of damage in Mayotte, and the 2011 Mb 4.9 16 .

        <p>We use seismic data at regional and teleseismic distances (ABKAR seismic array, Kazakhstan) and test different velocity models (Fig. S2, Tables S1-S4) to perform full waveform moment tensor (MT) inversions and depth phase analysis, thereby retrieving focal mechanisms, centroid locations (Figs. S3-S5) and depths (Figs. S6-S8) for the most energetic VTs 19 . Additionally, we take advantage of seismic station YTMZ, deployed over the full study period on Mayotte, to produce an enhanced catalogue 19 of relative locations of weaker VTs (Fig. S9). We detect 6990 VTs and locate 1904 of them (Fig. 1) by retrieving their origin direction and distance (Figs. S10-S11; see Supplementary Information, SI). The VTs are classified into families of events (colour-coded in Figs. 1 and2a-c) with similar waveforms and distance to station YTMZ (Fig. S12). We design a detection tool to scan the broadband data at four regional seismic stations for monochromatic, lowfrequency signals, thereby detecting 407 long-duration VLPs 19 (Fig. S13). We also develop an algorithm to invert for the centroid MT of the VLPs and resolve the damping constant and dominant frequency of a damped linear oscillator as the source time function, obtaining high-quality solutions for 22 VLPs 19 (Fig. 3).

        <p>We have identified four phases of the volcano-seismic crisis. During Phase I (10 May -7 June 2018) the most energetic VT burst of the sequence (11 Mw &gt; 5 events between 15 and 20 May) occurred ~35 km East of Mayotte (Fig. 2a). We find a depth of 22 km for the largest Mw 5.9 earthquake. Between 31 May -7 June 2018, the seismicity migrated upward, as confirmed by the centroid depth estimations and array beam analysis (Figs. 2c, S7-S8).

A consistent expansionrelated isotropic component, increasing gradually up to 20% of the total moment, is found during the upward migration and in Phase II (Figs. S5-S6).

        <p>Few M w &gt; 4.5 VTs (Fig. 2a) occurred in Phase III (28 June -17 September 2018), while VLPs became dominant. Phase IV (17 September, 2018 -March 2019) started with an increasing VLP rate, this time accompanied by a new type of VTs (Fig. 2c,d). The dominant period of VLPs increased smoothly from ~15.2 s (June 2018) to a maximum of ~15.6 s (October 2018), before decreasing again to ~15.3 s (February 2019; Fig. 2e,S13). The VLP MTs are similar (Fig. 1), with a predominance of alternating positive and negative vertical Compensated Linear Vector Dipole (CLVD) (Fig. 3). The vertically axisymmetric MTs suggest a subhorizontal crack, dipping slightly to the West. Centroid locations are the same within errors and depths are at 37±11 km. The largest VLP occurred on 11 November, 2018, with an estimated surface wave magnitude of M S 5.1. The damping of the VLP source (quality factor, Q) is in the range 72±6, which is higher than in other cases [21][22] but not unique 23 . VLPs onsets are often quasisimultaneous to one or multiple weak VTs, as observed previously 23 . Due to the emergent nature of VLP signals, it is difficult to judge whether VTs precede or follow VLPs, but some VLPs respond to VTs with abrupt signal amplitude changes, depending on whether the successive VTs are in or out of phase with the resonating VLP source (Fig. 4a). This observation suggests that VTs act as repeated forcing, contributing to the exceptionally long duration of some VLPs. The VLP spectra (Fig. 4b) reveal higher modes including non-integer ratios between them. Geodetic data from Mayotte Island reveal a steady, long-lasting subsidence and eastward displacement at four GNSS stations. The length of the displacement vector from July 2018 through April 2019 is 18 cm. Early ground deformation is weak, and grows clearly from July onward. We constrain the location, depth, aspect ratio and volume change by inverting these GNSS data for the time interval 1 July, 2018 -31 March, 2019. An isotropic source of pressure is unable to simultaneously fit the ratio of horizontal to vertical displacement and the vectors' orientation 1 . We use generalised point-source deformation models [24][25] , first assuming a vertical ellipsoidal source 26 and investigating the effect of layering on the inferred source shape (Figs. S14-S15). The best fit is given by a large negative isotropic plus a small positive vertical CLVD source 12±4 km East of Petit Terre at a depth of 32±3 km, volume change is here -1.7±0.4 km 3 . We also test nonaxisymmetric generalised point sources in a homogenous medium 24 , obtaining a laterally contracting vertical dislocation as the best-fit deformation mechanism at a depth of 23 km and expelled magma volume (potency) of -1.3 km 3 with 99% confidence bounds of (20, 27) km and (-2.8, -1.2) km 3 , respectively. This is a lower bound of the source potency since all GNSS stations are grouped on one side of the source, so that the network has no sensitivity to NS source contraction.Few M w &gt; 4.5 VTs (Fig. 2a) occurred in Phase III (28 June -17 September 2018), while VLPs became dominant.

        <p>Both analyses indicate that vertical shrinking of the source is negligible, suggesting that the shrinking source does not coincide with the source of the VLPs.Both analyses indicate that vertical shrinking of the source is negligible, suggesting that the shrinking source does not coincide with the source of the VLPs.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have identified two main stages of the unrest (Fig. 5). The first stage (Phases I-II), with the migration of an energetic seismic swarm from deep to shallow depth, is consistent with the propagation of a magmatic dyke through the whole crust. The second stage (Phases III-IV), with simultaneous VLP and VT activity and large deflation, suggests the evacuation of a sub-Moho, large reservoir and a multifaceted interaction between magma and host rock.In summary, we have identified two main stages of the unrest (Fig. 5).

        <p>The energetic seismic swarms in Phase I marks, to our knowledge, the first case of vertical propagation of a dyke traced for &gt;25 km from a deep magma reservoir to the surface, although dykes have been observed to propagate horizontally for longer distances [27][28] . Dyke-induced swarms of this magnitude are rare and attributed to large intruded volumes, which scale with the moment of induced events as a power law 29 . According to this model, the cumulative moment of Phases I-II, M 0 = 2•10 18 Nm, would correspond to a dyke volume of 5•10 -2 km 3 . Strike-slip focal mechanisms have been observed for other propagating dykes 28,[30][31][32][33] . Phase II involves a lateral dyke propagation, with VTs migrating 10-20 km towards South and reaching the seamount location 20 . The relative VT quiescence in Phase III is consistent with the establishment of an open pathway to the surface.The energetic seismic swarms in Phase I marks, to our knowledge, the first case of vertical propagation of a dyke traced for &gt;25 km from a deep magma reservoir to the surface, although dykes have been observed to propagate horizontally for longer distances [27][28] .

        <p>Taken together, these observations suggest that the end of Phase II may mark the onset of the submarine eruption. During Phase IV, VTs, VLPs and ground deformation appear interlinked mechanically. VTs plausibly trigger VLPs and accompany the slow evacuation of the magma reservoir (Fig. 2d,f). VLPs may have different causes, but ringing events such as those observed at Mayotte have previously been explained by the resonance caused by slow standing waves trapped at the fluid-solid interface of a fluid-filled crack or conduit 2,[35][36] . Here, their period and duration are especially long, which may be explained by the large size of the crack 20 , the stronger host rock because of the depth and basalt as the fluid filling the crack 3 . We use analytical formulas 37 to constrain crack geometry based on the dominant VLP period, which we assume is the fundamental resonance mode.Taken together, these observations suggest that the end of Phase II may mark the onset of the submarine eruption.

        <p>Fundamental periods of 15.2-15.6 s are possible for a wide range of lengths and thicknesses (Fig. 6). However, cracks with L &lt; 8 km have too little volume to expel more than 1.5 km 3 of magma. A crack with L &gt; 15 km is unlikely, given the distribution of seismicity (Fig. 1). Smooth dominant period changes from 15.2 to 15.6 s and back may result first from the crack predominantly thinning and next shortening (Fig. 6). For example, path for L = 12 km carries a volume loss of 1.6 km 3 .Fundamental periods of 15.2-15.6 s are possible for a wide range of lengths and thicknesses (Fig. 6).

        <p>For example, VLPs occurred before and during the 2000 caldera collapse at Miyakejima, Japan, both with oscillating signals 39 and 20-50 s single pulse source time functions 38,40 . With a maximum duration of ~60 s they were considerably shorter than those at Mayotte; their modelled source mechanism also had a different geometry [38][39][40] . They were interpreted as the resonance of an axially symmetric structure in response to a shallower trigger 39 or as resulting from the intermittent sinking of a vertical piston into the magmatic chamber, causing its sudden volumetric change 38,40 . At Piton de la Fournaise, La Reunion island, 0.02-0.50 Hz VLPs have been attributed to repeated piston-like collapse 42 . The thrust mechanisms of typical VTs in Phase IV, inconsistent with the NE-SW transtensional background stress regime, require a strong stress perturbation, likely provided by the evacuation of the magma reservoir. Steep outward dipping faults are typically formed in the early stage of reservoir roof failure upon depletion [43][44] . They occur on newly formed, distributed faults (as suggested by their small magnitude and existence of several families), rather than on a ring fault, confirming that the faulting is weakening the overlying material rather than representing the slip of a coherent block. As they are close above the reservoir, they may exert an efficient pressure pulse and trigger waves at the fluid-solid interface travelling towards the opposite edge of the reservoir and back, thereby producing a ringing signal 3 . The observed anti-correlated VT pairs (Fig. 4c) may be explained by the reverse motion on a fault, similar to observations during collapse events at calderas 45 . The January 2018 VLP, observed before the dyke had formed, suggests that the oscillator is a portion of the deep reservoir rather than the feeder dyke, and that the reservoir then had a similar size and shape.For example, VLPs occurred before and during the 2000 caldera collapse at Miyakejima, Japan, both with oscillating signals 39 and 20-50 s single pulse source time functions 38,40 .

At Piton de la Fournaise, La Reunion island, 0.02-0.50 Hz VLPs have been attributed to repeated piston-like collapse 42 . The thrust mechanisms of typical VTs in Phase IV, inconsistent with the NE-SW transtensional background stress regime, require a strong stress perturbation, likely provided by the evacuation of the magma reservoir. Steep outward dipping faults are typically formed in the early stage of reservoir roof failure upon depletion [43][44] . They occur on newly formed, distributed faults (as suggested by their small magnitude and existence of several families), rather than on a ring fault, confirming that the faulting is weakening the overlying material rather than representing the slip of a coherent block. As they are close above the reservoir, they may exert an efficient pressure pulse and trigger waves at the fluid-solid interface travelling towards the opposite edge of the reservoir and back, thereby producing a ringing signal 3 . The observed anti-correlated VT pairs (Fig. 4c) may be explained by the reverse motion on a fault, similar to observations during collapse events at calderas 45 . The January 2018 VLP, observed before the dyke had formed, suggests that the oscillator is a portion of the deep reservoir rather than the feeder dyke, and that the reservoir then had a similar size and shape.</p>
        <p>Our deformation models locate a volume loss of at least 1.3 km 3 at 25-35 km depth below the point where the four GNSS displacement vectors converge, which coincides spatially with the downsag seismicity and whose size is consistent with the variations of the VLP dominant period. A simple hypothesis is that the easternmost edge of the reservoir corresponds with the location of the earliest seismicity burst, later seen to migrate upwards. Thus, two questions remain: assuming a 15 km long reservoir, why is volume loss at the western edge and not the centre of the crack, and why is the shrinking horizontal rather than vertical? Reconciling the evidence suggest that a dipping sillshaped reservoir loosing buoyant magma would shrink at its deeper portion, here to the West, and one-sided drainage coupled mechanically with the reservoir's failing roof may explain the observed horizontal shrinking pattern. Alternatively, a more complex sill shape, with a vertical westernmost portion, could account for the crustal deformation pattern. Superposition of outward dipping thrust faulting are equivalent to a vertical positive CLVD 46 , which may explain the model derived from the geodetic data.Our deformation models locate a volume loss of at least 1.3 km 3 at 25-35 km depth below the point where the four GNSS displacement vectors converge, which coincides spatially with the downsag seismicity and whose size is consistent with the variations of the VLP dominant period.

The mechanical processes activated offshore Mayotte represent a scaled-up version of a caldera formation process at its nucleating, downsag stage 43 . Phase IV, currently in progress, involves the growth of deep faults at the western edge of the emptying reservoir. Observations and modeling of reservoir depletion 43 suggest that, should it continue, fault growth will affect a progressively wider area and become shallower. A particular hazard is posed by a scenario where the outward dipping faults reach the ocean floor causing the entire block to collapse abruptly, and new normal faults begin to propagate upward, reaching closer to Mayotte. We estimate the volume evacuation threshold needed to trigger such a collapse, V min , based on an equation developed for calderas 47 :Preliminary estimates suggest that more than 3.4 km 3 of magma effused at the seafloor 20 , making it also the largest geophysically monitored submarine eruption to date.

        <p>Sensor orientations were verified using a Rayleigh wave polarization analysis [7][8][9] , considering a set of more than 25 teleseismic events with a homogeneous azimuthal distribution at each station. For each event and station the cross-correlation between the Hilbert-transformed R component and the Z component in the time window containing Rayleigh waves are computed while rotating the horizontal components in 1 degree steps. A maximum cross-correlation obtained for zero rotation implies that the horizontal components of a sensor are correctly oriented. Amplitude gains of P phases were compared to synthetic data and among all stations to avoid problems arising from incorrect gain factors in the response functions or from unexpected site amplifications. Large timing errors on the order of several seconds were ruled out by assessing arrival times of teleseismic P phases across the network. Finally, power spectra computed from observed and synthetic data were compared as an additional check of gain levels and of reliable frequency ranges for MT inversion 7 . Synthetic traces and the power spectra were computed using the python based seismology environment

This probabilistic optimization assesses the earthquake source parameters as non-parametric posterior distribution in the form of a solution ensemble.

The number of usable stations varies from one event to the other, depending on the signal-to-noise ratios. For the forward modelling, synthetic seismograms were computed using Green's functions for different velocity models, resembling continental and oceanic crusts.

        <p>Here, we combined independent observations of teleseismic body-wave and regional surface-wave observations with information from different approaches. In particular, we complemented the MT inversion analysis, in which we inverted also for the centroid depth, with an analysis of teleseismic depth phases. This approach helped to tightly constrain the source depth based on the relative arrival times of waves traveling vertically upward and downward around the source. A correct estimate of the focal mechanism from regional data helped avoid misinterpretations of the detected depth phase (pP instead of sP). The overall good coherence among our results that was obtained using different datasets and approaches guarantees that our findings regarding the relative depth variations with time are robust.Here, we combined independent observations of teleseismic body-wave and regional surface-wave observations with information from different approaches.

        <p>Our estimates of centroid depths and their uncertainties for the 67 VTs in the strongVT regional catalogue, based on centroid MT inversion, showed that VTs migrated upward at the end of Phase I, between end of May and 7 June 2018 (Sec. 2.1 and Fig. S4). According to these estimates, seismicity migrates from ~30 km to less than 10 km depth, possibly eventually approaching the sea floor. This result confirms and extends previous findings 21 , based on local and regional data, that also identified a rough ascent of seismicity between ~35 -40 km and ~10 -15 km in the same time period.Our estimates of centroid depths and their uncertainties for the 67 VTs in the strongVT regional catalogue, based on centroid MT inversion, showed that VTs migrated upward at the end of Phase I, between end of May and 7 June 2018 (Sec. 2.1 and Fig. S4).

        <p>We used this approach to estimate the depth of the largest VTs and track the temporal variation of the average depth during the swarm, as follows. Assuming location and origin time from the reference catalogue for each Mw4+ event, and using the AK135 velocity model, we estimated the theoretical arrival time of the direct P wave at the ABKAR array. Continuous vertical component seismic data were downloaded for all chosen events and array stations, with a time window beginning 40 s before the theoretical P onsets and ending 100 s after. Raw data were then bandpass filtered between 0.8 and 2.5 Hz, and beamformed to have one single trace (beam) per event. The 0.8-2.5 Hz band was chosen here since teleseismic body wave arrivals were reliably detected in this frequency band and as a compromise between high mantle attenuation above 1 Hz and source radiation usually with higher energy above 0.5-1 Hz for moderate magnitudes events (M 4-5). We also tested higher and lower frequency bands, which resulted in a poorer resolution of pP phases.We used this approach to estimate the depth of the largest VTs and track the temporal variation of the average depth during the swarm, as follows.

        <p>The direct P wave was manually picked for each trace; events without a clear P arrival were rejected. Beams were aligned according to the picked P-arrival time.

        <p>Finally, to better identify the temporal variation of reflected wave delays, a normalized average envelope was computed every 3 hours, using the envelopes of all events occurring in a 4-day time window, starting 2 days before T i and ending 2 days after. Results are shown as function of time in Fig. S7. ). An absolute depth estimate was required to discriminate if the observed depth phases were pP/ pwP or sP. pP/pwP were more likely to be detected, given the expected radiation pattern for the focal mechanism of the main events. The reflected waves were identified as pP and sP (pwP water multiples may be present as well). A decrease in reflected waves' arrival times was apparent at the end of May, supporting the upward migration of VT seismicity at the end of Phase I. Thus, the upward migration of the largest VTs would be from about 25 to 10 km depth, and possibly reaching an even shallower depth by mid-June. Again, given the debated crustal structure at Mayotte, we tested three very different velocity models (P2017, P2017B, CRUST1), to check the stability of our results (Fig. S8). While the absolute depth values can be shifted (up to 8 km) depending on the chosen velocity model, the relative variations were similar for all tested models. These results support a clear upward migration at the end of Phase I, and a slightly shallower depth in Phase III-IV (sagging) with respect to the VTs in the early stage of Phase I (unrest at the reservoir). Beside the effect of the velocity model, a second source of uncertainty in the depth estimation concerns phase picking. Repeating the picking procedure for other frequency bands (1.5-3.0 Hz and 0.5-1.5 Hz) and consequently the depth estimation, we found an average difference of -0.5±1.1 km and 0.4±2.3 km, respectively. Furthermore, we found 4 repeaters, identified with the regional stations ABPO and YTMZ, for which we had picked pP arrivals at the ABKAR array in Kazakhsthan. For these events, the depth estimations are in the range 23.1±1.7 km, although the waveform similarity at regional distances suggest a similar depth for all them. The variability can be attributed to the pP picking procedure. In conclusion, both tests suggest that depth uncertainties due to the pP pickings can be estimated in about +-2km, thus much smaller compared to those due to the velocity model.Finally, to better identify the temporal variation of reflected wave delays, a normalized average envelope was computed every 3 hours, using the envelopes of all events occurring in a 4-day time window, starting 2 days before T i and ending 2 days after.

While the absolute depth values can be shifted (up to 8 km) depending on the chosen velocity model, the relative variations were similar for all tested models. These results support a clear upward migration at the end of Phase I, and a slightly shallower depth in Phase III-IV (sagging) with respect to the VTs in the early stage of Phase I (unrest at the reservoir). Beside the effect of the velocity model, a second source of uncertainty in the depth estimation concerns phase picking. Repeating the picking procedure for other frequency bands (1.5-3.0 Hz and 0.5-1.5 Hz) and consequently the depth estimation, we found an average difference of -0.5±1.1 km and 0.4±2.3 km, respectively. Furthermore, we found 4 repeaters, identified with the regional stations ABPO and YTMZ, for which we had picked pP arrivals at the ABKAR array in Kazakhsthan. For these events, the depth estimations are in the range 23.1±1.7 km, although the waveform similarity at regional distances suggest a similar depth for all them. The variability can be attributed to the pP picking procedure. In conclusion, both tests suggest that depth uncertainties due to the pP pickings can be estimated in about +-2km, thus much smaller compared to those due to the velocity model.</p>

        <p>To distinguish different families of earthquakes, we applied a waveform-based clustering technique, combining information from the waveform similarity and the differential S-P times, which reflect the distance to Mayotte. We first computed the 3-component cross-correlation at station YTMZ for each events pair, using a 12 s time window of raw waveforms starting 1 s before the P onset and bandpass filtered between 0.25 and 2.0 Hz. The cross-correlation was transformed into a distance value by mapping cross-correlation values between 1 (correlation) to -1 (anti-correlation) to distances between 0 (highest similarity) and 1 (lowest similarity). The distribution of the differential S-P times shows a clear minimum at 5.15 s, which separates two major groups of VT seismicity based on the distance to Mayotte. We attributed one group to dike propagation and the other group to sagging above the depleting reservoir (Fig. S11a). To force the separation between these two main families, we additionally fixed the distance value to 1 (i.e. dissimilar events) whenever the event pair include one VT associated with dike and one to sagging. Finally, we used a density-based seismicity clustering algorithm 30 to create a cluster whenever for one VT there were at least 19 others (1% of the dataset) with a distance below 0.15. Results are illustrated in Fig. S12 which shows the distance matrices, sorted chronologically and after the clustering. Since the density-based algorithm allowed for unclustered events, we finalized the process by assigning each of the unclustered VTs to one of the defined clusters, depending on its mean similarity to those in each cluster.To distinguish different families of earthquakes, we applied a waveform-based clustering technique, combining information from the waveform similarity and the differential S-P times, which reflect the distance to Mayotte.

Continuous times series envelopes in the 10 -20 s frequency band were fitted with those from the largest VLP event, which occurred on November 11, 2018. Potential new VLP detections were checked manually, picked, and either validated or rejected, by looking at their spectrograms. The checking procedure allowed for the rejection of a few false detections, mostly associated with regional earthquakes with long coda and narrow spectral content.

        <p>The surface wave magnitude uncertainty depends on the quality of the amplitude measurements for the considered period (T = 15.5 s). The monochromatic characteristic of the VLPs allowed these amplitudes to be easily picked. The standard deviation for the Ms estimations among the 4 used seismic stations was in the order of ~0.4 magnitude units. We computed ratios among different magnitude estimates obtained using data from different stations. A deviation from a magnitude ratio of ~1 can be attributed to the source radiation pattern. When the ratio among magnitude estimations (Ms) of different stations remained constant over time, the VLPs had a similar radiation pattern and the relative magnitude uncertainties were assumed to be small. The main limitation of our relative Ms estimation resulted from instrumental response problems occurring on LSZ and FURI stations.The surface wave magnitude uncertainty depends on the quality of the amplitude measurements for the considered period (T = 15.5 s).

        <p>We found that an isotropic source model in a homogeneous half-space cannot adequately represent the observations and overestimates the vertical displacements. To make use of more realistic dislocation source models, we designed a constrained MT-based point-source model. This source model represents a vertically elongated, deflating ellipsoid, similar to the point compound dislocation model 34 or an ellipsoidal cavity 35 .We found that an isotropic source model in a homogeneous half-space cannot adequately represent the observations and overestimates the vertical displacements.

        <p>The combination of an isotropic volume source model with a vertical compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) together with perturbed gradient elasticity models provides a better physical representation of the measured surface displacements.The combination of an isotropic volume source model with a vertical compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) together with perturbed gradient elasticity models provides a better physical representation of the measured surface displacements.</p>
