        <p>Scientists and engineers have observed for some time that tidal amplitudes at many locations are shifting considerably due to nonastronomical factors. Here we review comprehensively these important changes in tidal properties, many of which remain poorly understood. Over long geological time scales, tectonic processes drive variations in basin size, depth, and shape and hence the resonant properties of ocean basins. On shorter geological time scales, changes in oceanic tidal properties are dominated by variations in water depth. A growing number of studies have identified widespread, sometimes regionally coherent, positive, and negative trends in tidal constituents and levels during the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. Determining the causes is challenging because a tide measured at a coastal gauge integrates the effects of local, regional, and oceanic changes. Here, we highlight six main factors that can cause changes in measured tidal statistics on local scales and a further eight possible regional/global driving mechanisms. Since only a few studies have combined observations and models, or modeled at a temporal/spatial resolution capable of resolving both ultralocal and large-scale global changes, the individual contributions from local and regional mechanisms remain uncertain. Nonetheless, modeling studies project that sea level rise and climate change will continue to alter tides over the next several centuries, with regionally coherent modes of change caused by alterations to coastal morphology and ice sheet extent. Hence, a better understanding of the causes and consequences of tidal variations is needed to help assess the implications for coastal defense, risk assessment, and ecological change.Scientists and engineers have observed for some time that tidal amplitudes at many locations are shifting considerably due to nonastronomical factors.

        <p>Plain Language Summary Tides are one of the most persistent and dominant forces that shape our planet. The regular and predictable daily, fortnightly, monthly, annual, interannual, and longer-term changes in tides, driven by astronomical forces, are well understood. However, scientists and engineers have observed for some time that tides at many locations are shifting considerably due to nonastronomical factors. Here, we carry out a review of these important changes in tides, many of which remain poorly understood. We highlight that over long geological time scales, changes in tides are driven by tectonic processes, which alter the size, depth, and shape of the ocean. Over shorter geological time scales, changes in tides are mainly driven by changes in water depth. In recent decades, a growing number of studies have identified widespread, and sometimes regionally coherent, changes in tides during the last 150 years. However, determining exactly what has caused these more recent changes in tides has proven difficult. We discuss the local and regional/global mechanisms that might be responsible for the observed changes.Plain Language Summary Tides are one of the most persistent and dominant forces that shape our planet.

        <p>Tides remain one of the most persistent and dominant forces that shape our planet. They exert a crucial physical control on the coastal zone, shelf seas, and open ocean. At the coast, tides impact the timing and magnitude of storm surges and waves (Horsburgh &amp; Wilson, 2007;Prandle &amp; Wolf, 1978) and therefore modulate high sea levels and strongly influence coastal flooding and erosion (Pugh &amp; Woodworth, 2014). Navigation to and from ports is constrained by tidal stage, currents, and swell steepened by tidal currents (e.g., Akan et al., 2017), while tidal range largely determines the vertical zonation of species in coastal intertidal ecosystems (Stumpf &amp; Haines, 1998). In estuaries, the interplay between tidal currents, tidal mixing, and river flow helps to determine the extent of salinity intrusion (Jay, 1991;Geyer &amp; MacCready, 2014), impacts sediment transport, sets system morphology, and overall is a determining factor in the mass, momentum, and energy budgets of the river/estuary/shelf continuum (Burchard et al., 2018;Jay, 1991). In shelf seas, tidal currents control sediment transport (Simpson &amp; Sharples, 2012) and tidal renewable energy potential (Robins et al., 2015). Vigorous tidal currents produce coherent turbulent structures and surface boils (Nimmo-Smith et al., 1999;Talke et al., 2013), leading to the small-scale mixing and energy dissipation necessary for air/water gas exchange (Talke et al., 2013;Zappa et al., 2007), which impacts the drawdown of atmospheric CO 2 (Thomas et al., 2004) and alters the oxygenation of hypoxic waters (Talke et al., 2009). Tidal currents affect the formation and evolution of river plumes (Horner-Devine et al., 2009) and help to determine the dynamics of shelf sea fronts, therefore influencing primary productivity and fisheries (Simpson &amp; Hunter, 1974). In the open-ocean, tidal dissipation affects the large-scale circulation and vertical mixing (Green et al., 2009;Munk, 1966;Wunsch &amp; Ferrari, 2004). Furthermore, tidal levels (relative to chart datum) provide the physical basis for many national and international boundaries and, historically at least, geodetic systems (Shalowitz, 1962(Shalowitz, , 1964)). Changes to tidal levels and tidal currents, therefore, have wide-ranging and important scientific and practical implications.Tides remain one of the most persistent and dominant forces that shape our planet.

        <p>Tidal levels (e.g., mean high and low water), tidal range (i.e., the vertical difference between a tidal high and the following low water), and tidal currents vary on regular daily, fortnightly, monthly, annual, interannual, and longer-term time scales, driven by astronomical variations in the orbits and relative positions of the Sun, Moon, and Earth (Pugh &amp; Woodworth, 2014). Because planetary orbital motions are stable and predictable, the astronomical forcing of tidal motions is well characterized and tide predictions can be made far into the future (Cartwright, 1985). Due to their repeatability and importance for navigation, the study of tides is the oldest branch of physical oceanography (Cartwright, 1999). Perhaps because of the reliability of tide predictions, casual observers might assume that tidal prediction is a solved problem and that tidal constituents are stationary over time. Nonetheless, both scientists and engineers have long observed that tidal levels in many locations change considerably due to nonastronomical factors over seasonal, decadal, and secular time scales (e.g., Doodson, 1924).Tidal levels (e.g., mean high and low water), tidal range (i.e., the vertical difference between a tidal high and the following low water), and tidal currents vary on regular daily, fortnightly, monthly, annual, interannual, and longer-term time scales, driven by astronomical variations in the orbits and relative positions of the Sun, Moon, and Earth (Pugh &amp; Woodworth, 2014).

        <p>Our review of scientific literature indicates that changes in tides due to nonastronomical factors have primarily been noted at local scales over the past two centuries. For example, in rivers and estuaries, it has long been known that tides are greatly influenced by seasonal changes to river flow, with tidal motion completely disappearing in fluvial reaches during flood conditions (Powell, 1884). Similarly, engineers in Germany used theory and/or physical models to determine that building a weir on the Ems Estuary would amplify tides, due to increased reflection and local resonance (Keller, 1901). Engineering changes to the River Thames similarly had a big impact on its tidal history: the tidal range at London increased from 2 m during Roman times to 7-8 m during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Amin, 1983;Reidy, 2008). Scientifically, studies such as Doodson (1924), Schureman (1934), and Marmer (1935) observed that tides can vary significantly, most obviously due to harbor modifications and dredging. However, detailed explanations were usually lacking. Moreover, there was an apparent historical reluctance to explore methods for analysis of nonstationary time series in order to investigate these changes further. Part of this conservatism might be assigned to the stationarity assumption inherent in the harmonic analysis methodology that originated at the end of the nineteenth century (e.g., Darwin, 1898), although later pioneering works on tides such as Cartwright (1968) did recognize nonstationary behavior related to nonastronomical forcing.Our review of scientific literature indicates that changes in tides due to nonastronomical factors have primarily been noted at local scales over the past two centuries.

        <p>We start in section 2 by reviewing the modeling and observational studies that have investigated past changes in tides on (1) paleo-time scales from deep time to the Year 1800 (section 2.1) and ( 2) for the instrumental period from 1800 to present (section 2.4). We then go on in section 3 to evaluate and discuss our current understanding of the range of different mechanisms causing changes in tides over varying time scales, first at a local (e.g., estuary) scale (section 3.1) and then regionally and globally (section 3.3). We follow this in section 4 with a review of the modeling studies that have predicted future changes in tides (section 4.1) and then discuss important implications of these potential changes (section 4.2). Finally, we end in section 5 with conclusions and highlight key knowledge gaps and future research challenges.We start in section 2 by reviewing the modeling and observational studies that have investigated past changes in tides on (1) paleo-time scales from deep time to the Year 1800 (section 2.1) and ( 2) for the instrumental period from 1800 to present (section 2.4).

        <p>Studies of paleotides are generally model based (see, e.g., Arbic et al., 2004;Egbert et al., 2004;Green et al., 2017;Kagan &amp; Sundermann, 1996;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014, and references below) because of a lack of direct proxies for tides, and the proxies that do exist often lack spatial and/or temporal detail. Here, we give a brief overview of the methods that have been applied to infer past tidal conditions. Numerous studies have used cyclical sedimentary sequences, morphosedimentary data (e.g., coastline structure), salt marsh sedimentary deposits, and ecological indicators (e.g., species ranges across the intertidal zone) to classify paleoenvironments as microtidal, mesotidal, or macrotidal regimes (see Hinton, 1996, and references therein for a detailed overview of sedimentary records used for reconstruction of tidal environments). However, all rely on adequate preservation of the paleoenvironment, which is often hampered (Middleton, 1991). For example, using sublittoral sediment sequences Amos and Zaitlin (1985) and Amos et al. (1991) inferred that transitions in tidal regimes and tidal range changes had occurred throughout the deglaciation and Holocene in Chigneto Bay in the Bay of Fundy. Tidal laminations (rythmites), which are formed by varying amounts and types of sediment deposited on the flood and the ebb tide (e.g., Dalrymple, 1992), can be used to infer tidal components and longer-term variations but are highly localized in time and space and can give a range of potential tidal amplitudes (e.g., Tanavsuu-Milkeviciene &amp; Plink-Bjorklund, 2009;Williams, 2000). Attempts have also been made to reconstruct tidal dynamics by linking sea bed sediment types from sediments cores to bed shear stress in order to infer tidal current strength (Ward et al., 2015) but were hampered by limitations of the sedimentary records. Studies reconstructing changes in stratification in paleo-shelf seas from plankton assemblages (e.g., Scourse et al., 2002;Woods et al., 2019) can provide an indication of the strength of tidal currents by tracking tidal mixing fronts but again only provide an indication of regional tidal conditions. In the late twentieth century, a number of studies highlighted the possibility of using tidally driven microgrowth patterns in bivalve shells to reconstruct paleo-tidal dynamics (e.g., Pannella, 1976)-this method has been used to infer Late Pleistocene tides in Osaka Bay (Japan) (Ohno, 1989;Tojo et al., 1999) but has not been widely applied since. Other approaches, again based on cyclicity in sediments, constrain global dissipation rates through the lunar effects on Milankovitch cycle (e.g., Waltham, 2015), but this can introduce large errors in the recession rate if care is not taken. For example, Zeeden et al. (2014) concluded that the globally integrated dissipation rate 11 Ma must have been either within 10% or half of the present rate (the latter is the most likely one; Green et al., 2017). To date, however, no single method has been applied over a geographically wide range and proved to be a reliable method for reconstructing paleotides.Studies of paleotides are generally model based (see, e.g., Arbic et al., 2004;Egbert et al., 2004;Green et al., 2017;Kagan &amp; Sundermann, 1996;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014, and references below) because of a lack of direct proxies for tides, and the proxies that do exist often lack spatial and/or temporal detail.

        <p>Global MSL has generally been much higher than today over the past 500 Myr because of an absence of ice sheets, greenhouse climates, and younger (and hence lighter) tectonic plates (e.g., Hallam, 1984). The exception is the late Triassic (~200 Ma), when sea level was at a low-stand 50 m below present day (Haq, 2018). Over the past 2 Myr, however, MSL has fluctuated rapidly (in geological terms) by up to 130 m between glaciations and interglacial warm periods (e.g., Peltier, 2004). The present-day North Atlantic tides are large because the basin is near resonant (e.g., Arbic et al., 2004Arbic et al., , 2008Arbic et al., , 2009;;Arbic &amp; Garrett, 2010;Egbert et al., 2004;Green, 2010;Griffiths &amp; Peltier, 2008, 2009;Müller, 2007;Platzman, 1978;Platzman et al., 1981)-see section 3.3 for further details. Consequently, it can be argued that on shorter geological time scales, up to 2 Myr, changes in tides were mainly due to changes in MSL and ocean stratification (Egbert et al., 2004;Schmittner et al., 2015;Müller, 2012 gives a nice description of how changes in stratification in coastal areas can change tides), because continental drift is a very slow process (the average drift speed at present is ~5-6 cm/year; e.g., Müller et al., 2008). Further back in time, however, MSL becomes a second-order effect, because large-scale tectonic changes affected basin size, and hence the resonant properties, more than a high stand in MSL did (see Green &amp; Huber, 2013, for simulations of the sensitivity of present-day tides to largescale changes in bathymetry and MSL). Further back in time, beyond ~250 Ma, both tectonics and changes in the Earth's rotation rate control the resonant properties of the tide and need to be explicitly accounted for in numerical model experiments (e.g., Green et al., 2019;Kagan, 1997;Webb, 1982).Global MSL has generally been much higher than today over the past 500 Myr because of an absence of ice sheets, greenhouse climates, and younger (and hence lighter) tectonic plates (e.g., Hallam, 1984).

        <p>An early attempt to simulate the tidal evolution over the past 570 Myr was done by Kagan and Sundermann (1996), but at a resolution we today know is too coarse to accurately simulate basic tidal processes (Egbert et al., 2004). Their study also excluded tidal conversion, that is, the transfer of energy from the barotropic to the baroclinic tide, which is a crucial dissipation process in the global ocean (e.g., Egbert &amp; Ray, 2001;Green &amp; Nycander, 2013). Due to recent advances in tectonic modeling, and hence in the accuracy and resolution of the reconstructions (e.g., Matthews et al., 2016), Green and Huber (2013) and Green et al. (2017) revisited the subject and performed the first deep-time simulations with improved accuracy. Going back to the Permian-Triassic boundary, 252 Myr BP, and then simulating a further five slices (118,55,25,and 2 Myr), it was shown that tides are currently very large, and for most of the past 252-Myr tidal dissipation rates have been less than half of the present rates. This makes sense dynamically: There is no reason to have large tides during a supercontinental gathering, because basins are too large to be resonant. Also, sensitivity simulations in Green et al. (2017) indicated that with higher MSL, the tides became even less energetic, something Wilmes et al. (2017) also note.An early attempt to simulate the tidal evolution over the past 570 Myr was done by Kagan and Sundermann (1996), but at a resolution we today know is too coarse to accurately simulate basic tidal processes (Egbert et al., 2004).

        <p>From 2 Myr onward, on the other hand, MSL changes dominate long-term changes in the tides. The continental configuration over this period is virtually the same as today, at least at the resolution used in many paleotidal simulations (typically (1/4)°-(1/8)°, plates have moved ~100 km over the past 2 Myr). The tides at 2 Myr BP were still smaller than at present, however, because MSL was some 25 m higher than today (Green et al., 2017). This is an interesting result, because we would then expect the tides in the future to be smaller than today if MSL keeps rising. It also indicates that interglacial periods over the past 2 Myr may have had reduced tides, because they are associated with high MSL.From 2 Myr onward, on the other hand, MSL changes dominate long-term changes in the tides.

        <p>During the Last Glacial Maximum (26.5-19 kyr BP;henceforth LGM;Clark et al., 2009;Peltier et al., 2015) large parts of the Northern Hemisphere land masses were covered by extensive ice sheets which lowered global MSL by 120-130 m, which led to the exposure of most continental shelves. The MSL decrease and associated ocean basin shape change is thought to have shifted tidal dissipation from the shelf seas into the open ocean, thus profoundly altering the tides during this period. At the present, the largest tidal amplitudes are found in the shallow continental shelf seas, and analysis of satellite-constrained tide models has shown that out of a global total of 3.5 TW tidal energy dissipation, 1 TW (30%) of energy is lost to the internal tide in the abyssal ocean (Egbert &amp; Ray, 2001;Munk &amp; Wunsch, 1998;Nycander, 2005). Modeling of the global LGM tides (Arbic et al., 2004;Arbic et al., 2008;Egbert et al., 2004;Green, 2010;Griffiths &amp; Peltier, 2008, 2009;Thomas &amp; Sündermann, 1999;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014) suggests that the principal semidiurnal M 2 tide was especially sensitive to the LGM bathymetry changes. In the North Atlantic, M 2 amplitudes increased by several meters and reached amplitudes of over 6 m in some areas in the Labrador Sea (see Figures 1a and1b). Increases can also be seen for the South Atlantic, the Gulf of,Mexico and New Zealand. For K 1 , the open-ocean amplitudes show little change but certain regions experience larger diurnal tides such as the margins of Antarctica, the South China Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk (Griffiths &amp; Peltier, 2008, 2009;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). These estimates are somewhat sensitive to the abyssal stratification adopted (Arbic et al., 2008;Egbert et al., 2004;Griffiths &amp; Peltier, 2009), the sea level model used (Arbic et al., 2008) and, relating to the latter, local ice sheet extent. For example, the margins of the Antarctic Basin and in the Weddell and Ross Sea may have experienced megatides during the LGM. However, their amplitude is strongly sensitive to ice sheet extent and grounding line location (Griffiths &amp; Peltier, 2008, 2009) with local ice extent changes showing basin-wide tide effects (Rosier et al., 2014;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). Globally integrated dissipation for M 2 increased by around 1.5 TW to around 4 TW and energy losses in the abyssal ocean increased by a factor of 2-3 to 1.5-3 TW (Egbert et al., 2004;Green, 2010;Griffiths &amp; Peltier, 2009;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). The increases in amplitudes and dissipation during the LGM can be explained with the help of a damped harmonic oscillator model (Egbert et al., 2004), as discussed in section 3.3.3.During the Last Glacial Maximum (26.5-19 kyr BP;henceforth LGM;Clark et al., 2009;Peltier et al., 2015) large parts of the Northern Hemisphere land masses were covered by extensive ice sheets which lowered global MSL by 120-130 m, which led to the exposure of most continental shelves.

        <p>At the onset of the deglacial period (19-16 kyr BP) MSL increased by ~5 m/kyr (Peltier et al., 2015), and corresponding shelf area changes were initially small (see Figure 1c). As a consequence, amplitude changes were restricted to the edges of the European shelf, so that open-ocean dissipation remained high and close to LGM values (Figure 1d; Egbert et al., 2004;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). Between 16-and 8-kyr global MSL increased at rates of up to 15 m/kyr (Stanford et al., 2011), leading to the flooding of all major shelf seas. As an example, tides in the southern North Sea shifted from mesotidal to macrotidal between 8,000 and 6,000 years ago, as the land bridge to England was flooded and the system approached resonance (van der Molen &amp; de Swart, 2001). Large tidal amplitudes can be seen on the emerging European Shelf and Patagonian Shelf, while open Atlantic Ocean amplitudes remained enhanced during the middeglaciation period. M 2 dissipation began to shift from the open ocean into the shelf seas (Egbert et al., 2004;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). Large drops in open-ocean amplitudes and dissipation can be seen between 10 and 8 kyr, corresponding with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and opening of Hudson Bay and Strait (Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). For example, around this time regional deglacial enhancements in near-coastal tidal amplitudes can be seen across the European Shelf (Uehara et al., 2006;Ward et al., 2016), the northwest coast of the United States (Hill et al., 2011), and the western central Labrador Sea (Arbic et al., 2008).At the onset of the deglacial period (19-16 kyr BP) MSL increased by ~5 m/kyr (Peltier et al., 2015), and corresponding shelf area changes were initially small (see Figure 1c).

        <p>Throughout the remainder of the Holocene (7 kyr to present) MSL adjustments were small and supraregional amplitudes and dissipation closely reflected the present-day state (Egbert et al., 2004;Hill et al., 2011;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014). However, numerous studies have shown that local changes took place during the mid-Holocene across the European Shelf (Austin, 1991;Hinton, 1995Hinton, , 1996;;Shennan et al., 2000;Shennan &amp; Horton, 2002), along the east coast of America (Hall et al., 2013;Hill et al., 2011;Leorri et al., 2011), in the Bay of Fundy (Gehrels et al., 1995;Scott &amp; Greenberg, 1983) and in the China Sea (Uehara, 2001), but these are generally smaller than the changes experienced during the deglacial period and early Holocene.Throughout the remainder of the Holocene (7 kyr to present) MSL adjustments were small and supraregional amplitudes and dissipation closely reflected the present-day state (Egbert et al., 2004;Hill et al., 2011;Uehara et al., 2006;Wilmes &amp; Green, 2014).

        <p>Changes in the tides over the last ~220 years have generally been studied using long tide gauge records. Only a small number of records are available with start dates during the first half of the nineteenth century; Brest (Pouvreau et al., 2006), Marseille (Wöppelmann et al., 2014), New York (Talke et al., 2014), and Boston (Talke et al., 2018) are notable examples from Europe and North America, respectively. Automatic tide gauges became more reliable and common during the second half of the nineteenth century (e.g., Talke &amp; Jay, 2013), and such gauges were increasingly installed in many ports during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Many of the data collected before the advent and adoption of digital recorders in the 1970s to 1990s remain in analog format (see, e.g., Talke &amp; Jay, 2013, 2017), and, as a consequence, one is often constrained to using information from approximately the last half-century to assess and interpret global trends (e.g., Mawdsley et al., 2015;Woodworth, 2010). Multiple projects are in progress to improve the historical data set (known as "data archaeology," see, e.g., Bradshaw et al., 2015;Haigh et al., 2009;Talke &amp; Jay, 2017).Changes in the tides over the last ~220 years have generally been studied using long tide gauge records.

        <p>Two questions arise prior to the analysis of any long tidal record. The first is whether there have been any changes in the tide gauge location or changes in instrument type that could introduce discontinuities or spurious trends in tides at that location (see section 3.2.5 for a discussion). The second is whether there have been local changes to the hydrological regime, bathymetry, and related processes (e.g., sedimentation rates), in the vicinity of the tide gauge (see sections 3.2 to 3.2.4 for a detailed review of local mechanisms). This is a particular concern for gauges installed in rivers and estuaries, where many ports are located, or in coastal lagoons. These two concerns can be addressed by having information from as many stations as possible along the same coastline. Consistency of findings provides confidence that one is observing a genuine regional ocean process. Interpretation is more difficult along an irregular coastline with many rivers (e.g., NW Europe or SE Asia) and at isolated locations such as remote ocean islands.Two questions arise prior to the analysis of any long tidal record.

        <p>Most tide gauge data from the nineteenth century comprise tabulations of heights and times of high and low waters, with the difference between monthly or annual Mean High Water and Mean Low Water being mean tidal range (MTR). Even after automatic tide gauges were introduced in the 1830s (Matthäus, 1972), tidal charts at many ports were simply used to note the highs and lows. The full digitization of the charts to provide time series of typically hourly heights throughout the tidal curve became routine later, alongside the increasing use of the harmonic analysis of tide gauge data (Cartwright, 1999;Talke &amp; Jay, 2017). Consequently, the two types of data commonly employed in studies of changes in the tide are records of MTR or of harmonic constituents derived from the hourly time series. In areas of predominantly semidiurnal tides, MTR is approximately twice the amplitude of the M 2 constituent, although all other constituents also contribute to some extent (see appendices in Woodworth et al., 1991). Studies that have used MTR instead of harmonic constituents to explore changes in the tide include Flick et al. (2003) and Mawdsley et al. (2015).Most tide gauge data from the nineteenth century comprise tabulations of heights and times of high and low waters, with the difference between monthly or annual Mean High Water and Mean Low Water being mean tidal range (MTR).

        <p>Both continuous tide gauge time series and short sets of measurements taken some years apart provide an opportunity to examine possible long-term tidal changes. For example, Cartwright (1971) used short sets of data collected in 1761 and 1969 from St. Helena in the South Atlantic, finding little change in the dominant semidiurnal tide but apparent changes in diurnal phase lag. Cartwright (1972a) performed a similar study of historical data from Brest, finding a significant decrease in semidiurnal amplitude of order 1% per century between 1771 and 1936 (see also Cartwright, 1972b). Pouvreau et al. (2006) updated that work, concluding that the amplitude of the semidiurnal tide had increased in recent years from its smallest values around 1960 and that the tide had been smaller than average prior to 1880, indicating some kind of cyclic variation. Wöppelmann et al. (2014) found little change in the small (decimetric) tide at Marseille since the 1840s, other than those which can be explained by instrumental effects (see section 3.2.5). In New York Harbor, measurements suggest that tide amplitudes decreased slightly from the 1840s to the early 1900s and increased thereafter by 5-10%, depending on location (Chant et al., 2018;Talke et al., 2014). In Boston, Talke et al. (2018) discussed, in the contexts of both local engineering changes and wider regional tidal changes, a large (~5.5%) decrease in MTR during the nineteenth century, after which it was relatively stable and even increased slightly after 1930 (see also Ray &amp; Foster, 2016) Woodworth (2010) and Müller et al. (2011). In most cases the changes in amplitudes, both positive and negative, are of order several percent per century and in most cases tend to be statistically significant.Both continuous tide gauge time series and short sets of measurements taken some years apart provide an opportunity to examine possible long-term tidal changes.

        <p>For the reasons given above, it is hard to make firm conclusions from individual station records regarding the validity of the findings, let alone determine the reasons for them. To do better, it is necessary to take a wider perspective and test for tidal changes in denser networks.For the reasons given above, it is hard to make firm conclusions from individual station records regarding the validity of the findings, let alone determine the reasons for them.

        <p>A number of regional investigations have been made over the past decade. One example concerns the Gulf of Maine for which changes in the tide have been suspected for many years (Doodson, 1924;Godin, 1995). Ray (2006) concluded that M 2 amplitudes had been increasing at stations in the Gulf of Maine for most of the twentieth century, at rates ranging from 43 mm per century (Boston) to 133 mm per century (Eastport). More recently, Ray and Talke (2019) showed that the secular change in Gulf of Maine tides does not extend into the nineteenth century. Greenberg et al. (2012) determined that trends in M 2 amplitude after 1982 at Portland, Eastport, and Saint John were essentially half of those observed previously due to an apparent regime shift, which was also reflected in changes in trend in MSL. This reduction was accompanied by a positive trend in tidal phase throughout the entire North Atlantic (Müller, 2011). In addition, Ray (2009) found S 2 amplitude to have reduced along the entire east coast of North America, and at Bermuda, over the period 1935-2005. These S 2 amplitude changes were enormous (order of 10% per century) and are considered as the largest and most coherent changes of ocean tides on supraregional scales.A number of regional investigations have been made over the past decade.

        <p>The tides of the west coast of North America contain much larger diurnal components than on the east coast, so both species can contribute to significant changes in high and low water levels. Jay (2009) used 34 records with lengths more than 44 years, concluding that diurnal (K 1 ) and semidiurnal (M 2 ) amplitudes had increased by ~2% per century since the midtwentieth century. The Ray (2009) and Jay (2009) findings are important indicators that ocean tides are changing faster than expected. Confidence in this conclusion comes from the large number of stations along the tested coastlines, the regional coherence in the findings, and the fact that the tide gauge data in North America are among the best quality in the world.The tides of the west coast of North America contain much larger diurnal components than on the east coast, so both species can contribute to significant changes in high and low water levels.

        <p>Attempts to achieve a global understanding of tides have a long history, dating back to just after the invention of the recording tide gauge in the early 1830s. The first global survey was carried out by British authorities in June 1835 under the direction of William Whewell, with the cooperation of the United States and other powers, a total of nine countries (Reidy, 2008;Whewell, 1836). Up to 2 weeks of data were collected at 15-min intervals at some 700 stations, an astonishing logistical feat for the time given the many competing national interests. Determination of the basic properties of tides globally was the priority, and no consideration was given at that time to the idea that tides might change over the years. Further data archaeology of Whewell's 1835 tidal information, before the large-scale development of many harbors, might well prove valuable.Attempts to achieve a global understanding of tides have a long history, dating back to just after the invention of the recording tide gauge in the early 1830s.

        <p>Comprehensive recent compilations of tide gauge data by the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (https:// uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/) and the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis project (Woodworth et al., 2017; https:// www.gesla.org) have enabled quasi-global studies of changes in tides (Müller et al., 2011;Woodworth, 2010). These surveys confirmed results of Ray (2009) and Jay (2009) for North America and identified robust features of tidal evolution in other areas (Figure 2). Positive changes in M 2 amplitude were found in the eastern North Sea and Norway, while estimated trends appeared to be spatially more variable around the United Kingdom and the southern European Atlantic coastline. Increasing amplitudes for S 2 , K 1 , and O 1 were also found on eastern North Sea coasts, whereas both the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes have increased at most Australian locations and decreased at most northern Japanese stations. This is consistent with the results in Rasheed and Chua (2014). The signals at Pacific Ocean islands were more spatially variable, although stations in the Hawaiian Islands analyzed by both Woodworth (2010) and Müller et al. (2011) indicated increasing amplitudes. Mawdsley et al. (2015) made use of MTR data instead of harmonic constants, and came to similar conclusions regarding regional changes, for example, in the NE Pacific, German Bight, and Australasia.Comprehensive recent compilations of tide gauge data by the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (https:// uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/) and the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis project (Woodworth et al., 2017; https:// www.gesla.org) have enabled quasi-global studies of changes in tides (Müller et al., 2011;Woodworth, 2010). These surveys confirmed results of Ray (2009) and Jay (2009) for North America and identified robust features of tidal evolution in other areas (Figure 2). Positive changes in M 2 amplitude were found in the eastern North Sea and Norway, while estimated trends appeared to be spatially more variable around the United Kingdom and the southern European Atlantic coastline. Increasing amplitudes for S 2 , K 1 , and O 1 were also found on eastern North Sea coasts, whereas both the diurnal and semidiurnal amplitudes have increased at most Australian locations and decreased at most northern Japanese stations. This is consistent with the results in Rasheed and Chua (2014).

        <p>This body of work has demonstrated that regionally coherent changes in the tide have occurred along particular coastlines. However, the tides have changed differently in different regions, thereby preventing overall conclusions on common forcing factors. Regressions of tidal estimates against the low-frequency components of MSL from sea level records suggest some degree of association between perturbations in water depth and the tide; see, for example, the analysis of UK MTR data (Woodworth et al., 1991) and more recent largerscale studies (Devlin, Jay, Talke, et al., 2017;Devlin, Jay, Zaron, et al., 2017;Devlin et al., 2018;Schindelegger et al., 2018). Moreover, recent papers have attempted to include changes in phase as well as amplitude, to provide a more complete picture of the response of tides to potential forcing factors. On the other hand, Mawdsley et al. (2015) did not find such an association in a composite regression of MTR versus MSL trend estimates from a fully global in situ network, and areas of pronounced MSL rise did not exhibit unusually large tidal variations. Therefore, links between changes in tides and changes in MSL (which is discussed in detail in section 3.3.3) will only be partial at best.This body of work has demonstrated that regionally coherent changes in the tide have occurred along particular coastlines.

        <p>Another question is whether the observed regional tidal changes are purely coastal ones or also occur across the shelf and in the neighboring deep ocean. An "open-ocean" island sites analysis such as that of Zaron and Jay (2014) for 30 gauges at Pacific island sites provides one way of addressing this question. They found that statistically significant increases in M 2 and K 1 amplitudes were occurring at 12 and 4 stations respectively, with decreases at only one and two stations, respectively. However, another conclusion was that instrumental improvements in tide gauge recording at most of the same sites could have contributed to an apparent increase in M 2 tidal amplitudes and were dominant for four sites. Even at remote island locations, harbor modifications have occurred and were dominant at two stations. This provides a further warning that the combination of historical and modern data can introduce biases in an analysis. In principle, long records of precise altimeter data could contribute to elucidating the spatial extent of changes in tides.

        <p>The synthesis above points to both local and regionally coherent changes in the tide over large portions of the world coastline. In this section we review the range of mechanisms that can cause these changes in tides, first at local scales (section 3.1) and then at regional/global scales (section 3.3), with most of the emphasis given to the instrumental period of the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries. Tidal variability induced by gravitational forces warrants a prior mention, as the astronomical tide-generating potential undergoes modulations on a multitude of time scales, from intra-annual, to interannual (the 4.4-and 8.8-year perigean and 18.6-year nodal cycles; Haigh et al., 2011) to the 21,000-year cycle in the longitude of solar perigee (Pugh &amp; Woodworth, 2014). As an example, the recession of the Moon from the Earth must be explicitly accounted for in deep-time tidal simulations; Green et al. (2017) state the lunar distance at 252 Ma was 96% of the present, leading to an increase of the tide-generating potential of some 13%. However, secular rates of tidal potential coefficients in modern catalogues (e.g., Hartmann &amp; Wenzel, 1995) are miniscule, typically 0.02% per century or less for leading semidiurnal constituents and somewhat larger (0.1% per century) for declinational tides (i.e., K 2 and Mf) that are affected by the current decrease of the Earth's obliquity (Cartwright &amp; Tayler, 1971). Hence, on nongeological time scales and over the era of instrumental measurements, gravitational forcing is usually considered stationary.The synthesis above points to both local and regionally coherent changes in the tide over large portions of the world coastline.

        <p>Worldwide, the most dramatic recent changes in tidal properties have occurred in estuaries and tidal rivers (Talke &amp; Jay, 2020;Winterwerp, 2013). For example, tidal ranges have more than doubled since the late nineteenth century in the upper reaches of the Hudson and Ems Rivers (Ralston et al., 2019;Schureman, 1934;Talke &amp; Jay, 2013;Winterwerp, 2013) and the Cape Fear River at Wilmington (Familkhalili &amp; Talke, 2016). Tidal ranges have similarly doubled for high flows (above 10,000 m 3 /s) in the tidal river part of the Columbia River estuary (Jay et al., 2011). By contrast, a sharp reduction in tidal range in some Dutch estuaries has occurred, apparently due to changes in resonance associated with port development (Vellinga et al., 2014). Tidal trends are often larger at estuary stations (order 5-10% per century) than nearby coastal stations (Jay, 2009). Why are estuary and tidal rivers so sensitive to changing conditions?

        <p>Within estuaries and rivers, tides are affected to leading order by frictional damping, which tends to reduce tidal amplitudes, and bathymetric funneling, which tends to amplify tides (Friedrichs &amp; Aubrey, 1994;Jay, 1991). Hence, any change to frictional resistance alters this balance. To understand how frictional damping can change, one needs to examine the turbulent mixing characteristics of the system, because turbulence extracts energy from the mean flow and is eventually dissipated by the action of viscosity (e.g., Tennekes &amp; Lumley, 1990).Within estuaries and rivers, tides are affected to leading order by frictional damping, which tends to reduce tidal amplitudes, and bathymetric funneling, which tends to amplify tides (Friedrichs &amp; Aubrey, 1994;Jay, 1991).

In addition, geometric features such as islands and channel bifurcation cause chaotic mixing (Zimmerman, 1986), by producing 2-D eddies with vertical vorticity that serve to distribute both scalars and momentum and (by necessity) are influenced by bottom friction. Particularly at the estuary mouth but also on intertidal flats, wave-current interactions greatly influence the bed stress (e.g., Talke &amp; Stacey, 2003. Changes to any of these small-scale (relative to the tidal wavelength) factors affect the G/J ratio and have the potential to alter tidal properties. In the Ems River, the formation of a 30-to 40-km-long blanket of fluid mud (de Jonge et al., 2014;Talke et al., 2009) reduced hydraulic roughness and inhibited turbulence (Winterwerp, 2013), thereby contributing to increased tidal range. Similarly, episodic sediment transport events linked to river floods in the Guadalquivir Estuary, Spain temporarily amplified the tidal range in the upper part of a tidal river; as fluid mud concentrations decreased, tides returned to normal (Losada et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2014). In California, shoaling and very high concentrations of coarse sediment caused by hydraulic mining eliminated tides in the landward part of the Sacramento River Delta in the late nineteenth century (Gilbert, 1917;Moftakhari et al., 2015), with tidal influence returning as the sediment pulse worked its way through the system. More recently, sediment supply has decreased sharply (Schoellhamer, 2011) and changes to the dune field in the ebb-tidal delta have been implicated as one of the reasons for increasing tide range in San Francisco Bay (Rodríguez-Padilla &amp; Ortiz, 2017). Tides (and storm surge) are also affected by changes to wetland and intertidal fauna and biota, since the effective drag is increased by features such as oyster reefs and marsh plants (e.g., Orton et al., 2015). Other factors such as changes in sediment supply, dredging, and altered circulation patterns can alter dune fields and, therefore, bed roughness.

        <p>Multiple analytical, field, and numerical studies have now established that depth changes can change estuary tides, primarily through the frictional term in the momentum balance (Chernetsky et al., 2010;DiLorenzo et al., 1993;Familkhalili &amp; Talke, 2016). Over long time scales, channel deepening for shipping has shifted tidal processes in multiple estuaries (de Jonge et al., 2014;DiLorenzo et al., 1993;Jay et al., 2011) and is a primary factor for the long-term changes to estuary tides.

Adding "retention basins" to a tide model (effectively a momentum sink) generally causes a reduction in tide amplitudes (Li et al., 2016). By contrast, an increase in tidal high water (and thus tide range) appears to have been caused by massive flooding of the Dollard subbasin in the Middle Ages, followed by a decrease when about two thirds of the Dollard was reclaimed and surface area decreased (Freund &amp; Streif, 2000;Talke &amp; de Swart, 2006). This suggests that the balance of channel convergence and friction can be modified by resonance and reflection, especially in short estuaries.Reviews of Geophysics amplified tides in the Cape Fear Estuary.

        <p>The reflection of a tide wave at a river boundary, and the partial reflection that occurs due to abrupt changes in width and depth, tends to cause local amplification in tides (Chernetsky et al., 2010;Jay, 1991). Estuaries that are about a quarter of a wavelength long are particularly susceptible to amplification. The usual quarter wave argument is simplistic, however, in that it neglects friction. In the absence of friction, resonance is infinitely sharp, and even a very small deviation of the actual length from the quarter wavelength criterion would essentially eliminate resonance. Thus, friction plays a dual role (Dronkers, 1964). On the one hand, some friction is needed to broaden the resonant peak (in terms of estuary length) such that resonance can actually occur. On the other, very strong friction will eliminate resonance because of the rapid damping of the tide toward the head of the estuary. In practice, strongly resonant systems almost always exhibit a convergent geometry (which increases tidal amplitude by funneling of the wave energy) and are deep enough Year Year that tidal currents are not too strong. Two criteria are usually cited in identifying resonance: (a) an increase in tidal amplitude toward the head of an estuary and (b) a 90°phase difference between elevation and current. However, these criteria also describe the behavior of a single incident wave in a strongly and uniformly convergent channel with weak to moderate friction. Moreover, Godin (1993) showed that the actual criteria for resonance is rather more complex than the quarter wave rule, due to interaction of the tide in the estuary with the rest of the ocean. The system is not truly resonant unless there is an amphidrome within the system.The reflection of a tide wave at a river boundary, and the partial reflection that occurs due to abrupt changes in width and depth, tends to cause local amplification in tides (Chernetsky et al., 2010;Jay, 1991).

        <p>Leaving aside these dynamical complexities, changes to either length or depth of an estuary can alter tidal amplification. As discussed in Talke and Jay (2020), the largest changes occur in systems that were highly damped historically but have been significantly deepened. For example, construction of a weir in 1900 altered the length of the Ems estuary and produced an amplification in upriver tides (Chernetsky et al., 2010;Keller, 1901;Talke &amp; Jay, 2013). Progressive deepening has further moved the system toward resonance (de Jonge et al., 2014). In the Columbia River, a bathymetric constriction caused locally amplified tides (Giese &amp; Jay, 1989) and may contribute to the secular increase in tides at Astoria (OR). Similarly, a partial reflection was noted by Familkhalili and Talke (2016) at the end of the shipping channel in the Cape Fear estuary. Tides in the resonant Long Island Sound have amplified over secular time scales, likely due to MSL rise (Kemp et al., 2017). Tides in the Guadalquivir estuary in Spain are also affected by reflection (Dıez-Minguito et al., 2012).Leaving aside these dynamical complexities, changes to either length or depth of an estuary can alter tidal amplification. As discussed in Talke and Jay (2020), the largest changes occur in systems that were highly damped historically but have been significantly deepened. For example, construction of a weir in 1900 altered the length of the Ems estuary and produced an amplification in upriver tides (Chernetsky et al., 2010;Keller, 1901;Talke &amp; Jay, 2013). Progressive deepening has further moved the system toward resonance (de Jonge et al., 2014).

        <p>River flow interacts nonlinearly with tides and increases the effective frictional damping (Godin, 1986(Godin, , 1991(Godin, , 1999;;Jay, 1991) particularly in tidal rivers, where river flow is typically strong (Hoitink &amp; Jay, 2016). The interaction is quantitative, in the sense that it can be used to estimate river flow from tidal records (Cai et al., 2014;Moftakahri et al., 2013Moftakahri et al., , 2016)). Over long time scales, alteration in river flow can produce a secular trend in tides, particularly in upstream locations far from the coast. In both San Francisco Bay (Moftakahri et al., 2013;Rodríguez-Padilla &amp; Ortiz, 2017) and the Columbia River estuary (Jay et al., 2011;Naik &amp; Jay, 2011), long-term decreases in river inflow are a factor contributing to growth in the M 2 tide. It is important to distinguish, however, between changes in tidal amplitude related to changing river flow and changes in tidal amplitude for a given (fixed) river flow. In fact, both have occurred in the Columbia, due to an increase in hydraulic efficiency related to navigational development. The nearly linear astronomical tidal constituents are not the only components of the tide affected by river flow and changes therein. Looking landward in a river estuary, overtides typically first increase, due to frictional interactions of the main tidal constituents with each other and with river flow (e.g., Gallo &amp; Vinzon, 2005;Godin, 1999;Guo et al., 2015;Jay &amp; Flinchem, 1997). They then decrease, as the main tidal constituents become too small to maintain overtide generation, and frictional dissipation of the overtides increases, due to the landward increase in river flow velocity. Nonlinear fortnightly variability is typically maximal further landward in a tidal river than the overtides and may persist beyond the point where the main tidal constituents are extinguished (Buschman et al., 2009;Jay et al., 2015;Leblond, 1979), in part due to the long wavelength of this oscillation (much longer than the estuary-tidal river; Hoitink &amp; Jay, 2016).River flow interacts nonlinearly with tides and increases the effective frictional damping (Godin, 1986(Godin, , 1991(Godin, , 1999;;Jay, 1991) particularly in tidal rivers, where river flow is typically strong (Hoitink &amp; Jay, 2016).

        <p>The five factors considered above lead to real changes in tides at a local scale. However, water levels and tidal constituents can erroneously appear to have changed for a number of technical reasons associated with the sea level measurements (Woodworth, 2010). These include (i) an undocumented change of the tide gauge location, (ii) a change in tide gauge technology, and/or (iii) errors caused by timing problems or calibration errors. For example, recording at Liverpool on the west coast of England prior to the 1990s took place at a location 3 miles (4.83 km) south of where the current tide gauge is operated now. Although the tide is similar at the two locations, there are small differences in all tidal constituents (Lane, 2004), which could be reported as a secular change in the tide by an analyst of Liverpool data unaware of the move. A change in location can also mean that a gauge is exposed to a different wave regime, and, given that waves can bias the measurement of sea level by some types of gauge (Pugh &amp; Woodworth, 2014), this can result in an inhomogeneous data set. Another concern is whether recording has been made by the same type of gauge (float, pressure, acoustic, and radar) as each technique has its own biases, and so a change in technology can again result in subtle changes to the data. Finally, timing errors, the symptoms of which are discussed by Zaron and Jay (2014), are often evident in sea level measurements digitized from historic tidal charts and can result in spurious changes in 10.1029/2018RG000636The five factors considered above lead to real changes in tides at a local scale.

        <p>Reviews of Geophysics calculated tidal statistics. Timing problems can be caused by clock errors or sedimentation of the stilling well (e.g., Agnew, 1986) or could occur when tidal charts were placed on the rotating drum by the operator without accurately resetting the drum offset to zero (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, 1985). Before the use of digital computers for processing tide records, a tide "computer" (a person with a pencil) could only make very simple corrections for time and elevation errors in records, and reprocessing from the original paper record may allow for improvement in these corrections (e.g., Talke &amp; Jay, 2013, 2017). The inaccurate clocks used in the first generation of "digital" gauges (those without paper records) in the 1960s to the 1980s were also subject to timing errors, which may be larger than occurred in the "marigram" period, when a paper record was used (e.g., Talke et al., 2018). The latter problem was exacerbated by the reduction in human gauge checks that accompanied the transition to digital instruments. It is therefore vital, particularly when conducting assessments of changes in tides over regional scales, that the possibility of instrument errors be considered.Reviews of Geophysics calculated tidal statistics.

        <p>Spatially coherent variations observed in both tidal levels and constituents over the last century cannot be explained by the above-mentioned local mechanisms alone. Instead, at regional and global scales, the following range of possible driving mechanisms has been proposed to explain long-term secular changes in the tides (e.g., Müller, 2012;Müller et al., 2011;Woodworth, 2010): (1) tectonics and continental drift, ( 2) water depth, (3) shoreline position, (4) extent of (sea)ice coverage, (5) seabed roughness, (6) ocean stratification and internal tides, (7) nonlinear interactions (frictional or triad), and (8) radiational forcing.Spatially coherent variations observed in both tidal levels and constituents over the last century cannot be explained by the above-mentioned local mechanisms alone.

        <p>As discussed previously (section 2.1), it can be argued that to first order the tidal properties of a basin are set by the tectonic configuration. This is because it is the length scale of a basin, along with its depth, that determines the resonant periods, and the shape of a basin is largely set by the tectonically controlled distribution of continents and ocean. Because of the motion of the Earth's tectonic plates, it is thus expected that regions go in and out of resonance at all scales-from small inlets to ocean basins (Green et al., 2017(Green et al., , 2018)depending on the tectonic configuration. Indeed, Green et al. (2018) identified a supertidal cycle that is linked to the tectonic supercontinent cycle; during a period of supercontinent aggregation, tides are very weak-close to equilibrium tides-except for isolated small inlets where local resonances can act. The reason for the overall weak tide is simply that the large horizontal scale of the ocean external to the supercontinent is out of resonance and thus not supporting a large tide. Consequently, there is no forcing in the deep ocean for large tides in local or regional basins either, although local resonances can of course still occur and lead to amplifications of up to a factor 10 (e.g., Balbus, 2014 for some theoretical considerations). As continents drift apart, basins may go in and out of resonance, thus enabling large local and regional tides. These can be generated both locally, because the basin itself is resonant (cf. the present-day Bay of Fundy), and remotely, because the regional basin is near resonant, thus allowing for a larger tidal forcing at the boundary of a region (cf. the present-day North Atlantic allowing large tides on the European shelf).As discussed previously (section 2.1), it can be argued that to first order the tidal properties of a basin are set by the tectonic configuration.

        <p>Changes in water depth due to geocentric (or absolute) MSL rise or geological processes such as the crust's glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) have been explored as one of the main drivers of changes in tide at the regional/global scale (Arns et al., 2015;Flather et al., 2001;Greenberg et al., 2012;Kemp et al., 2017;Müller et al., 2011;Pickering et al., 2017;Ross et al., 2017;Schindelegger et al., 2018).

        <p>The first mechanism is that of resonance: Large tidal amplitudes and dissipation occur when the tidal forcing frequency lies close to the natural period of an ocean basin. Therefore, increases in water depth could push an ocean basin, shelf sea, or embayment closer to resonance, increasing the tidal range, or it may be moved away from resonance, reducing the tidal range (e.g., Green, 2010; (Green et al., 2009;Montenegro et al., 2007;Schmittner et al., 2015;Wunsch, 2003); however, the consequences of increased tides for the LGM meridional overturning circulation (MOC) remain debated (Green et al., 2009;Montenegro et al., 2007;Schmittner et al., 2015). Furthermore, the hypothesis has been put forth that the megatides in the Labrador Sea during the last glacial period may have had decreased Laurentide Ice Sheet stability and possibly contributed to periodic ice stream instabilities (Arbic et al., 2004(Arbic et al., , 2008)). Arbic et al. (2009) and Arbic and Garrett (2010) The second mechanism is that a change in water depth alters the propagation speed of the tidal wave and causes a spatial reorganization amphidromes (Figure 5). In a semienclosed basin, MSL rise and thus increasing water depth causes the amphidromic point to shift toward the open boundary, leading to an increase in tidal range at the dissipative end of the basin (Taylor, 1922).

        <p>amphidrome alters the spatial distribution of tidal currents and therefore the spatial pattern of energy dissipation, which is dependent on U 3 /H (Garrett et al., 1978;Simpson &amp; Hunter, 1974); where U is velocity and H is water depth. If greater tidal range at the dissipative end is associated with larger currents, the greater amount of energy lost to friction may counteract the depth effects. This in turn would shift the amphidrome to the left of the direction of propagation of the tidal wave in the Northern Hemisphere. This would increase the tidal range on one side of the basin while reducing it on the other. The increase in tidal range would also decrease the proportion of tidal energy reflected by the dissipative boundary, leading to a further displacement of the amphidrome. Taylor (1922) investigated these processes using simple analytical solutions. The shifting locations of all amphidromic points on the European Shelf with MSL rise and the associated increases or decreases in the M 2 tide are mapped in Figure 4 of Pickering et al. (2012). Idier et al.

        <p>Another factor influencing tide changes is the shoreline position or the horizontal extension and surface area of the water body. Such changes imply variations in the dissipation and modifications of the natural period of oscillation of the basin. These changes can be related to water depth changes (section 3.3.2), extent of ice cover (section 3.3.4), and also shoreline dynamics (retreat, accretion) or changes in coastal defense structures. The effect of the shoreline dynamics on tide changes at a regional or global scale has not yet been investigated, except for studies of paleotides when the continents and/or ice sheets were organized differently (see section 2.1).Another factor influencing tide changes is the shoreline position or the horizontal extension and surface area of the water body.

        <p>Coastal defense structures and flood defenses influence not only the MSL rise itself but also the landward spread of the tide and potentially the tide at the regional scale and global scale (Pelling, Green, et al., 2013;Pelling, Uehara, et al., 2013;Pelling &amp; Green, 2014;Pickering, 2014;Pickering et al., 2017). Increasing the landward propagation of a tide wave implies an increase in the dissipation and modifications of the natural period of oscillation of the basin. For example, using a numerical experiment approach, Pelling et al. (2013) show that the tide response (to MSL rise) of the Irish Sea is controlled by the flooding of estuaries, increasing open-water tidal amplitudes through the increased dissipation in the newly flooded areas, as explained by the damped harmonic oscillator (Arbic et al., 2009). Similarly, Pelling, Green, et al. (2013), Pelling, Uehara, et al. (2013) show that the changes in the North Sea are dominated by the flooding of the Dutch coast (assuming present-day defenses are not maintained), which shifts the areas of tidal energy dissipation from the present coastline to the new flooded areas and thus moves the amphidromic points toward the coast. The same happens at the global scale (see section 4.1), where the changes in tide caused by inundation of land in tidal simulations with large-scale MSL are of the same order of magnitude as the tide changes induced by the water depth increase alone (Pickering, 2014;Pickering et al., 2017).Coastal defense structures and flood defenses influence not only the MSL rise itself but also the landward spread of the tide and potentially the tide at the regional scale and global scale (Pelling, Green, et al., 2013;Pelling, Uehara, et al., 2013;Pelling &amp; Green, 2014;Pickering, 2014;Pickering et al., 2017).

        <p>The interaction between sea ice and surface tidal currents can induce tidal variability, which has been, so far, mainly observed on seasonal time scales. This interactive process is described by the insulation of the ocean surface from wind forcing and the frictional effect between ocean surface currents and sea ice (Prinsenberg, 1988;St-Laurent et al., 2008). Müller et al. (2014) showed, using a coupled ocean circulation, tide, and sea ice model, and a comparison with observations, that sea ice is an important driver of seasonal variation of highlatitude tides. In the Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait, where seasonal variations in tidal amplitude can be up to 0.1 m, the amount of energy dissipated by underice friction is 21 GW, or about 10% of the bottom drag dissipation in the region.The interaction between sea ice and surface tidal currents can induce tidal variability, which has been, so far, mainly observed on seasonal time scales.

        <p>In addition, varying sea ice cover in polar regions can drive tide changes through several of the above factors, for example, water depth (section 3.3.2) and shoreline position (section 3.3.3). Godin and Barber (1980) and Godin (1986) observed some correlation locally between tide changes and ice cover. The numerical experiment of Georgas (2011) shows that the winter ice field (and the associated friction) is an explanation for sudden tide changes in the Hudson River, both at the ice front and further afield (where reflection from the ice front may be important).In addition, varying sea ice cover in polar regions can drive tide changes through several of the above factors, for example, water depth (section 3.3.2) and shoreline position (section 3.3.3).

        <p>Apart from sea ice cover, ocean tide properties may also respond to variations in the geometric configuration of marine ice sheet margins, particularly the extensive ice shelves surrounding the Antarctic ice sheet. Specifically, if an ice shelf is perturbed in such a way as to alter its areal extent, thickness, and grounding line, this would affect the tide by changing local water column thickness and the position of lateral boundaries. Using a regional barotropic tide model for the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and the southern Weddell Sea, Padman et al. (2018) showed that tidal currents near the Ronne ice front will decrease substantially if the ice shelf thins, with an approximate slowdown of 0.1 m/s for a hypothetical 100 m loss of vertical ice extent. In a range of sensitivity experiments, Rosier et al. (2014) modeled perturbations of tidal amplitude in an ocean domain south of 60°S for several scenarios of ice sheet evolution, including projected shifts in grounding line up to the Year 2500 as constrained by external ice sheet models. K 1 amplitudes were found to respond to this ice shelf retreat with increases of a few decimeters in both the Ross and Weddell Seas, whereas M 2 mainly changed under the Filcher-Ronne Ice Shelf as a result of ice thickness reduction. Both Rosier et al. (2014) and Padman et al. (2018) highlight the role of tides and their variations in modulating the low-frequency dynamics of ice sheets, for example, through feedbacks on basal melt rates and ice stream velocities. However, the effect of actual (and not projected) changes of Antarctic cavity geometry on tides themselves, especially on global scales, remains unexplored.Apart from sea ice cover, ocean tide properties may also respond to variations in the geometric configuration of marine ice sheet margins, particularly the extensive ice shelves surrounding the Antarctic ice sheet. Specifically, if an ice shelf is perturbed in such a way as to alter its areal extent, thickness, and grounding line, this would affect the tide by changing local water column thickness and the position of lateral boundaries. Using a regional barotropic tide model for the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and the southern Weddell Sea, Padman et al. (2018) showed that tidal currents near the Ronne ice front will decrease substantially if the ice shelf thins, with an approximate slowdown of 0.1 m/s for a hypothetical 100 m loss of vertical ice extent. In a range of sensitivity experiments, Rosier et al. (2014) modeled perturbations of tidal amplitude in an ocean domain south of 60°S for several scenarios of ice sheet evolution, including projected shifts in grounding line up to the Year 2500 as constrained by external ice sheet models. K 1 amplitudes were found to respond to this ice shelf retreat with increases of a few decimeters in both the Ross and Weddell Seas, whereas M 2 mainly changed under the Filcher-Ronne Ice Shelf as a result of ice thickness reduction.

        <p>The character of the sea bed can be changed over time by many natural (e.g., including waves and tidal currents; Idier &amp; Astruc, 2003) and human processes (e.g., trawling; Aldridge et al., 2015). Beam trawling, in particular, the process by which heavy chains and a large net attached to a beam are dragged across the sea bed, has been reported to lead to flattening of the bottom, causing a reduction in bottom friction (e.g., Schwinghamer et al., 1996). It has been suggested that changes in seabed roughness could therefore induce changes in tides. Further research in this area is therefore needed.The character of the sea bed can be changed over time by many natural (e.g., including waves and tidal currents; Idier &amp; Astruc, 2003) and human processes (e.g., trawling; Aldridge et al., 2015).

        <p>Changes in ocean stratification can have multiple effects on tidal dynamics. First, they can change the tidal conversion rate, that is, the transfer of energy from barotropic to baroclinic tides, as well as the surface expression of the internal tide. The effect on the barotropic tide through changes in the internal tide field at regional or global scales has not been well explored beyond sensitivity tests on long time scales (i.e., millennia, see Egbert et al., 2004 andWilmes &amp;Green, 2014). It has been shown, however, that the surface expression of internal tides can vary on seasonal time scales due to variations in the stratification and ocean currents (e.g., Müller et al., 2012). A local analysis of the tide-gauge record from Honolulu, Hawaii by Colosi and Munk (2006) attributes the recorded secular increase of the M 2 surface tide amplitude of 16.1 to 16.9 cm between 1915 and 2000 to a 28°phase change of the internal tide, induced by time-variable density stratification along the wave propagation path to the measurement site (see also Mitchum &amp; Chiswell, 2000). Nonlinear mechanisms can also be involved. At stations around the Solomon Islands, strong connection between semidiurnal tidal anomaly trends and changes in thermocline depth, overtide generation, and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have been observed. As shown by Devlin et al. (2014), this correlation could result from the changes in nonlinear triad resonance of barotropic (M 2 ) and internal tides (K 1 and O 1 ) associated with changes in stratification.Changes in ocean stratification can have multiple effects on tidal dynamics.

        <p>Another effect of varying stratification on tides is by means of changes in the vertical eddy viscosity profile, which is important in shallow waters. In principle, eddy viscosity can cover orders of magnitude by transitions from stable-stratified to well-mixed conditions, thereby affecting tidal current profiles. Müller et al. (2012) showed, using analytical and numerical models, that stratification changes between winter and summer can modify the tidal transport by 5% and that a deepening of the mixed-layer depth by only 10 m can induce a transport change of 1-2%, which might be relevant to understand secular trends of tides in a warming ocean. On seasonal time scales this effect has been observed in tidal current profiles (e.g., Howarth, 1998) and evoked in explanations of seasonal changes of around 6% in the M 2 surface tide in the North Sea and Yellow and East China Sea (Kang et al., 2002;Müller et al., 2014).Another effect of varying stratification on tides is by means of changes in the vertical eddy viscosity profile, which is important in shallow waters.

        <p>Nonlinear interactions between tidal constituents and between tides and nontidal processes can lead to significant variations in tides. Regarding the former, at many locations it has been found that the 18.6-year nodal cycle variations in tidal amplitude is smaller than the 3.7% one would expect for M 2 in the tidal potential. This can be explained by the nonlinear frictional tide-tide interactions (Ku et al., 1985); for example, Ray and Foster (2016) showed that the M 2 tide in Boston (U.S. Atlantic coast) varies by 2.9% over the 18.6-year nodal cycle. Smaller variations for M 2 have also been found around the United Kingdom by Amin (1983Amin ( , 1985) ) and Woodworth et al. (1991), around the west coast of Australia (Amin, 1993), as well as in the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine (Ku et al., 1985;Müller, 2011;Ray, 2006;Ray &amp; Talke, 2019). Feng et al. (2015) found differences from equilibrium nodal expectations for variations in both semidiurnal and diurnal tides along the coast of China. Jay et al. (2015) found that the S 2 /M 2 ratio varied along an estuary-fluvial river continuum. There are two likely causes: (i) the primacy of the M 2 -river flow interaction (no other constituent is as much affected by river flow as M 2 ) and (ii) the fact that tidal energy propagation depends on the square of tidal amplitude, while dissipation depends on its cube.

Thus, changes in the nonlinear tide-tide interactions at other time scales than the nodal cycle have been observed by Gräwe et al.

Given these observations, any factor that alters tide-tide interaction (such as altered bed friction) can produce a trend in one or more tidal constituents; however, extracting these (usually small) factors remains a challenging signal processing task, except when changes to nonlinear interaction are large.

        <p>Variations in tides caused by interactions between the tide and nontidal processes include a large spectrum of phenomena, ranging from storm events to interannual and decadal-scale variability. Examples include storm surge effects (e.g., Horsburgh &amp; Wilson, 2007;Idier et al., 2012;Prandle &amp; Wolf, 1978;Zhang et al., 2010), seasonal variations of mean currents and winds (e.g., Devlin, Jay, Talke, et al., 2017;Devlin et al., 2018;Müller, 2012), and climate variations such as ENSO (e.g., Devlin et al., 2014). The tide changes manifest themselves as variations in tidal constituents from year to year and can result in a long-term trend in tidal parameters if a corresponding trend exists in the nontidal forcing. Without discriminating between the sources of the sea level fluctuations, Devlin, Jay, Talke, et al. (2017), Devlin, Jay, Zaron, et al. (2017) investigated tide gauge records in the Pacific Ocean, and their results suggest that interannual tidal variability is correlated to sea level variability at most (92%) of tide gauges in the Pacific, with statistically significant rates between ±1% and ±50% of the MSL rise observed. However, the correlations of the multiple mechanisms inducing tide and sea level variability make it challenging to discern the individual causes of observed variability. For instance, Devlin et al. (2018) suggest that seasonal variability of tides in Gulf of Thailand and near Singapore could arise from monsoon-related changes in winds. Tidal current and tidal water level interact directly with wind and pressure, through the advection term in the shallow-water theory (the water depth enters in the denominator of the friction term in the shallow-water equations) and nonlinear friction term related to velocity interactions (Flather, 2001;Haigh et al., 2010a;Horsburgh &amp; Wilson, 2007;Zhang et al., 2010). Wind-induced waves, in addition to superelevation of water, can also alter tide magnitudes during storms (e.g., Arns et al., 2017). In many cases, the dominant tide-surge interaction term comes from the friction term. Depending on the event and location, the tide-surge interaction can have a significant effect on water level at the event scale (several tens of centimeters; Idier et al., 2012). However, the long-term effect on the tidal constituents is smaller, since it would require a long-term trend in the frequency and/or magnitude of storms.Variations in tides caused by interactions between the tide and nontidal processes include a large spectrum of phenomena, ranging from storm events to interannual and decadal-scale variability.

        <p>The term "radiational potential" was introduced by Walter Munk to account for motions of a tidal nature, which are caused, directly or indirectly, by the Sun's radiation, instead of being of astronomical tidal origin due to the Moon or Sun (Cartwright &amp; Tayler, 1971;Munk &amp; Cartwright, 1966). Such radiational (or "meteorological") oscillations dominate the tides of the atmosphere, through absorption and differential heating processes, and are also important as components of the ocean tide. Relative to their astronomical counterparts, the largest radiational tides in the ocean occur due to the annual and semiannual variation in air pressure, and the ocean's subsequent response via the inverse barometer effect, and due to Sun-synchronous meteorological changes at the diurnal S 1 frequency. These meteorological forcings include diurnal variations in air pressure and also small-scale contributions from land-sea breezes (Ray &amp; Egbert, 2004;Rosenfeld, 1988). Numerical modeling (e.g., Ray &amp; Egbert, 2004;Schindelegger et al., 2016) shows that the radiational part of the S 1 ocean tide can have amplitudes of a few centimeters in some regions (Arabian Sea, eastern Indian Ocean, and Okhotsk Sea) and that it dominates the solar diurnal gravitational component by an approximate factor of 5 throughout the ocean. Pugh and Woodworth (2014) also point to possible spurious manifestations of S 1 in tide gauge measurements, related, for example, to the daily heating and cooling of thermally sensitive instruments.The term "radiational potential" was introduced by Walter Munk to account for motions of a tidal nature, which are caused, directly or indirectly, by the Sun's radiation, instead of being of astronomical tidal origin due to the Moon or Sun (Cartwright &amp; Tayler, 1971;Munk &amp; Cartwright, 1966).

        <p>Radiational contributions to the solar semidiurnal ocean tide S 2 are smaller than gravitational S 2 oscillations but nonetheless important. In the tropics, air pressure tends to be a maximum near 10:00 and 22:00 local time, with amplitudes that vary approximately as 125cos 3 ϕ Pa, where ϕ is latitude (e.g., Haurwitz &amp; Cowley, 1973). Modeling of the ocean's dynamic response to this semidiurnal pressure loading suggests that the radiational component of S 2 is about 15% of gravitational S 2 on average (Arbic, 2005).

        <p>If radiational forcings vary from year to year or with a secular component, the ocean's response will change. In fact, large-scale modulations of the diurnal pressure cycle (~20 Pa) and concomitant changes in the S 1 ocean tide occur during extreme phases of ENSO (Schindelegger et al., 2017) but are restricted to time scales of less than a year. Ray (2009) summarizes reports of secular changes in the atmospheric S 2 tide, none of which points to overly large trends in available barometric records. Given the ocean's dynamic response at the S 2 frequency, secular changes seen in tide gauge data might come from pressure loading in any place, including areas of scarce meteorological observations. Hence, the relevance of radiational forcing for changes in tides remains to be confirmed by future research.If radiational forcings vary from year to year or with a secular component, the ocean's response will change.

        <p>As discussed in section 2.1, on short geological time scales up to 2 Myr ago, large-scale changes in tides were mainly due to changes in water depth and to a lesser extent shoreline position and ice extent. Further back in time, however, water depth becomes a second-order effect, because large-scale tectonic changes affected basin size, and hence the resonant properties, more than water depth. Over the instrumental period of the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries it is much more difficult to attribute observed changes in the tide, because tide gauge measurements are affected not only by the above regional mechanisms but also by local processes (section 3.1). Overall, it has been difficult to produce unequivocal evidence of the effects of the individual local and regional mechanisms, because (i) most changes in observed tides are modestly correlated with multiple forcing factors (Devlin et al., 2014), (ii) correlation does not imply causation, and (iii) extensive modeling studies (numerical or analytical) are needed to verify any one mechanism for any location or region.As discussed in section 2.1, on short geological time scales up to 2 Myr ago, large-scale changes in tides were mainly due to changes in water depth and to a lesser extent shoreline position and ice extent.

        <p>In classical tide models, effects of geocentric MSL rise and vertical land movement are explored in a comparatively simple manner through modifications of bathymetry. Müller et al. (2011) performed M 2 simulations at low ((1/2)°) and high ((1/8)°) horizontal resolution, with trend patterns from GIA models and altimetric sea levels scaled to represent water depth changes over the past 100 years. These simulations demonstrated peak sensitivities of the tide in the North Atlantic to GIA-related crustal subsidence and increases in MSL, the former accounting for 30-40% of the magnitude of measured M 2 trends on a basinwide average. However, spatial patterns, and thus the sign of simulated M 2 changes, did not agree well with those inferred from observations. Schindelegger et al. (2018) revisited the issue with a high-resolution ((1/ 12)°) global tide model, in which uncertainties related to the self-attraction and loading term (the "iteration jitters" encountered by Müller et al., 2011) were greatly mitigated using an exact spectral decomposition of tidal elevations at each time step. With water depths adjusted for GIA and geocentric MSL changes, the model could reproduce the sign of the observed M 2 amplitude trends at 36 out of 45 analyzed tide gauge stations in Europe and Australia (Figure 6), and at the North Atlantic American coasts (Figure 7). Schindelegger et al. (2018) additionally reported success in capturing large fractions (order 50% or more) of the magnitude in measured M 2 changes, primarily in shallow seas dominated by frictional effects, for example, the Gulf of Mexico, the German Bight, the Northwest Australian Shelf, and the Chesapeake-Delaware Bay system; see also Ross et al. (2017) for a comparison of tide gauge data with modeling results in the latter area. Yet changes in water depth alone appear inadequate to explain some of the very large trends seen in tidal amplitude on the European Shelf (e.g., the English Channel and the Irish Sea) as well as the Gulf of Maine. In a calibration experiment, Greenberg et al. (2012) showed that an inordinate depression of ~2 m per century at the western North Atlantic shelf break would be necessary to mimic the M 2 changes observed at coastal stations in the Gulf of Maine. Hence, the twentieth century trends of the tide in that area remain a vexing signal, possibly related to a small change of the Atlantic tide at the gulf's mouth being amplified by the resonant nature of the basin (Ray, 2006).In classical tide models, effects of geocentric MSL rise and vertical land movement are explored in a comparatively simple manner through modifications of bathymetry.

Another frequently cited, although yet unproven, hypothesis is that the significant decrease of the S 2 constituent in the western North Atlantic Ocean relates to large changes in the semidiurnal atmospheric pressure tide (Ray, 2009), which might undergo modifications in a warming climate with altered stratospheric absorption characteristics (Covey et al., 2014). However, a very large (~40% per century) change in the air tide would be required to induce the observed S 2 trends, and similar amplitude decreases evidently occur in the K 2 constituent, which has only minor radiational component.

        <p>As Hill (2016) points out, paleo-time scales have occupied much of the attention of past modeling work on large-scale changes in tides (section 2.1), while navigational impacts over the last few centuries have been a primary focus of local modeling and data analysis (section 3.1). However, recent studies have been increasingly geared toward prediction of future changes in tides over the 21st century and beyond, motivated by concerns regarding climate change, particularly MSL rise (e.g., Holleman &amp; Stacey, 2014) and changes in coastal flooding (see section 4.2). Climate-induced relative MSL rise will lead to increases in water depth, which will alter tidal dynamics via a range of mechanisms (section 3.3). However, studies have also assessed how tides may change in the future with large-scale land reclamation (Pelling, Green, et al., 2013) and natural and anthropogenic changes in coastal morphology (de Boer et al., 2011;Passeri et al., 2016), variations in ice sheet extent (e.g., Pickering, 2014;Rosier et al., 2014;Wilmes et al., 2017), changes in ocean warming (Carless et al., 2016), which influences tides via variations in vertical stratification (Müller, 2012) and with the introduction of tidal power stations (e.g., Ward et al., 2012).As Hill (2016) points out, paleo-time scales have occupied much of the attention of past modeling work on large-scale changes in tides (section 2.1), while navigational impacts over the last few centuries have been a primary focus of local modeling and data analysis (section 3.1).

The majority of modeling studies have used finite difference grids. The different studies have used a wide range of numerical software, boundary conditions, and configuration settings, with model grids of varying horizontal resolution (Hill, 2016).

Studies have considered a wide range of future projections, with MSL varying from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change typical range by 2100 (i.e., up to 1 m; Church et al., 2013) to the low probability but high impact end of the scale by 2100 (~2.5 m; Lowe et al., 2009), to very high values of 10 m out to 2300 and beyond (which would require significantly ice loss from Greenland and/or Antarctic; DeConto &amp; Pollard, 2016). Studies have also modeled future conditions in different ways, with some authors using simple spatially constant increases in water depth (equal to assumed MSL rise), while others have accounted for some assumed spatial variability in sea level change and vertical land movements (e.g., associated with GIA and other processes, such as subsidence caused by withdrawal of groundwater).

        <p>Many studies have investigated future changes in tides on the NW European Shelf and specific areas within this domain. Results from earlier studies of the NW European Shelf tides (e.g., de Ronde, 1989;Hinton, 1996;Kauker, 1998;Flather &amp; Williams, 2000;Flather et al., 2001;Howard et al., 2010;Kauker &amp; Langenberg, 2000;Lowe &amp; Gregory, 2005;Lowe et al., 2009;Plüß, 2004;Sterl et al., 2009;Vellinga et al., 2009) suggest that changes in tidal amplitudes and levels would only be a few centimeters under 0.5-2-m MSL rise. However, more dedicated explorations of future tides in this region provide evidence that changes in the M 2 amplitudes might be up to 0.1 m per meter of change in MSL. For example, Pickering et al. (2012) found significant (up to 30 cm) increases in the M 2 tidal amplitude with 2 m of MSL rise in parts of the European shelf and also areas on the shelf where the sign of the changes was reversed (up to -40 cm). Interestingly, Ward et al. (2012) obtained results with opposite signs of the amplitude changes in some regions to Pickering et al. (2012) in certain areas. Pelling, Green, et al. (2013) and Pelling and Green (2014) used numerical tidal models alongside classic tidal theory to explore why there were significant differences in the tidal changes predicted by Pickering et al. (2012) and Ward et al. (2012). They showed that the way in which MSL rise is implemented highly influences the modeled tidal response (Figure 9). When vertical walls are assumed at the present-day coastline (as in Pickering et al., 2012), predicted changes in tides due to increased water depth differ from the case where coastal areas are flooded (as Ward et al., 2012 did) and the response is largely controlled by dissipation in the newly introduced wet grid cells. Pelling and Green (2014) found that the largest changes in tides with MSL rise occurred, somewhat surprisingly, when flood defenses were accounted for (where they exist) allowing only part of the coastline (currently not protected) to flood. Idier et al. ( 2017) considered a greater number of tidal constituents and also nonuniform MSL rise 2017), they found that predicted changes in tidal levels were not especially sensitive to how the coastline was implemented, for the southern part of the coastline in this area. This was because the coastline south of 40°S is mostly characterized by high cliffs and due to the fact that the tide propagates northward. However, north of 40°S, where the coastline is dominated by beaches and wetlands, the response was more highly affected by added dissipation in the inundated cells. Carless et al. (2016) investigated how tides on the Patagonian Shelf might respond to various levels of nonuniform MSL change and considering different grid resolutions. They also assessed the effects of ocean warming over the area, as tides can be influenced by the strength of vertical stratification (see section 3.3.6). They predicted a decrease in tidal amplitudes along the coast as a result of a possibly more stable water column, if the surface layer heats up more than deeper waters. Rosier et al. ( 2014) ran hypothetical numerical simulations to assess the effect that removal or reduction in the extent and/or thickness of the Ross and Ronne-Filchner ice shelves would have on tides around Antarctica. With the removal/reduction in ice shelves changes in the M 2 amplitude of up to 50 cm in the Weddell Sea were found. These could potentially lead to tidally induced feedbacks on ice shelf/sheet dynamics which in turn would influence global MSL (as proposed in Pickering, 2014).Many studies have investigated future changes in tides on the NW European Shelf and specific areas within this domain.

        <p>On the scales of large bays and estuaries, Greenberg et al. (2012) showed that the combined effects of MSL rise (partly attributed to post glacial rebound) and increasing tidal range in the Bay of Fundy could produce a significant increase in the high water levels, much greater than those seen when considering MSL rise in isolation. Pelling, Uehara, et al. (2013) investigated changes in the tidal regime in the Bohai Sea, China over the last 35 years and for the future with 1, 2, and 3 m of MSL rise. They found significant changes in the tidal regime in the Bohai Sea over the last 35 years, with M 2 amplitudes changing by up to 20 cm in some parts, due to rapid coastline changes resulting from natural developments of the Yellow River delta and large-scale anthropogenic land reclamation. In this region, their results suggested that predicted future changes in tides were sensitive to whether the coastal areas are allowed to flood, or not, in the model. They also found that changes in tidal amplitudes were not proportional to the magnitude of MSL rise. respectively. Recently, Feng et al. (2019) investigated tidal changes in the Yellow Sea. They found a notable decrease in tidal range occurs in the northern shelf, and the tide increases mainly in the southern shelf, with MSL rise.On the scales of large bays and estuaries, Greenberg et al.

        <p>Many other studies have predicted changes in tides with MSL change for smaller estuaries around the world (e.g., Cai et al., 2012;Valentim et al., 2013) and idealized estuaries (e.g., Du et al., 2018). The results of these are hard to generalize. Du et al. (2018) demonstrated that tidal response to MSL rise is spatially uneven and differs depending upon estuary length, bathymetry, and geometry. 4.1.3. Global-Scale Studies Using a relatively coarse ((1/6)°) global tidal model, Green (2010) simulated changes in the M 2 and K 1 constituents with a uniform MSL rise of 5 and 60 m (akin to an almost complete melting of polar ice sheets). He found increases in tidal amplitude in many of the mixed and diurnal areas, suggesting that these areas would move closer to resonance as MSL increases. The extreme case of a 60-m MSL rise resulted in weaker global tides, as the larger shelf seas gives rise to increased tidal dampening-a result supported by sensitivity simulations of the present day tide in Green and Huber (2013). Pickering (2010) investigated uniform MSL rise scenarios of 1, 2, and 10 m with a fixed coastline and drew a similar conclusion of a sensitivity of global shelf sea tides to MSL rise, with a change in the global pattern being similar at 1-and 2-m MSL rise but differed between the 2-and 10-m scenarios.Many other studies have predicted changes in tides with MSL change for smaller estuaries around the world (e.g., Cai et al., 2012;Valentim et al., 2013) and idealized estuaries (e.g., Du et al., 2018).

        <p>Pickering (2014) and Pickering et al. (2017) used a fully global (1/8)°forward tidal model to assess changes in the four primary tidal constituents for MSL rise scenarios ranging from 0.5 to 10 m. With fixed coastlines, they found that tidal amplitudes responded strongly in shelf seas globally, whereas simulations with coastal recession tended to result in reductions in tidal range. Therefore, coastal management strategies could potentially influence the sign of the tidal amplitude change. With 0.5-, 1-, and 2-m MSL rise, around 10% of the 136 largest coastal cities analyzed experience changes in mean high water in excess of ±10% of the MSL change imposed (Pickering et al., 2017).Pickering (2014) and Pickering et al.

        <p>The majority of these studies have used a spatially homogeneous MSL change. When Pickering et al. (2017) introduced a spatially varying MSL change, induced by large-scale ice sheet melt of Greenland and/or West Antarctic, they found only modestly altered tidal response in low latitudes but greater differences at high latitudes. Wilmes et al. (2017) assessed how the M 2 tide responds to nonuniform sea level changes induced by complete collapses of the West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. Aside from large heterogeneous changes in tides along coastlines, these simulations point to a sensitivity of the North Atlantic tides to the West Antarctic ice sheet extent. Schindelegger et al. (2018) analyzed more modest future changes in the M 2 tidal constituent on a global scale with GIA-induced crustal motion and altimetric MSL trend patterns averaging 2 m. Again, they found that when allowing for flooding of new areas, M 2 amplitudes decreased in many basins. In contrast to Luz Clara et al. (2015) and Carless et al. (2016), their flooding run exhibited considerably larger sensitivity to water depth change than simulations with unaltered present-day coastlines for the Patagonian Shelf. This hints at feedback effects between shelf and basin tides which are difficult to account for in models configured for regional domains, in agreement with Arbic et al. (2009). These simulations indicate that changes in tidal amplitude occur particularly in shelf seas with increases of up to 15%. A key benefit of global model simulations is their inclusion of changes in coastal tides on the shelf, in deep water and the coupled interaction between the two (and a finite element approach may be the most effective way to further examine these interactions). 4.1.4. Deep-Time Future Investigations On long time scales, MSL changes become a secondary effect in controlling future tides, as is the case for the past (see section 2.1 and Green et al., 2018). The reason MSL changes evoke large responses in today's ocean is the near-resonant state of the North Atlantic-a property largely set by tectonics. MSL changes can influence the resonant properties by drying or flooding shallow shelf seas. This effectively modulates the damping of the tidal wave, with potentially large implications for the tidal system (see Arbic &amp; Garrett, 2010;Egbert et al., 2004;Green, 2010, for discussions). When large regions of ocean are not in a (near) resonant state, changes in MSL will have limited ability to influence the tides, and any effects are mainly local. However, the present resonant state of the North Atlantic is expected to remain for the next 25 Myr, and investigating the influence of even moderate MSL rise on tides is therefore justified.The majority of these studies have used a spatially homogeneous MSL change.

        <p>The influence of tides is pervasive on many aspects of human activity from commerce to coastal protection to ecosystem services. As mankind moves into an era of adaptation to our changing climate, we should consider changes to tides as another factor to plan for in our adaptation strategies. We consider implications in five main areas: (1) coastal flooding, (2) energy, (3) sediment transport, (4) tidal mixing fronts, and (5) intertidal habitats. 4.2.1. Coastal Flooding Both trends and variations in tidal levels influence extreme sea levels and thus coastal flooding and erosion (e.g., Talke et al., 2018). Globally, up to 310 million people are at risk of coastal flooding today (Hinkel et al., 2014).The influence of tides is pervasive on many aspects of human activity from commerce to coastal protection to ecosystem services.

        <p>Coastal flooding is already a growing threat due to MSL rise (Church et al., 2013), and changes in tidal levels will affect flood risk: Tidal range, in addition to changes in MSL (Figure 10) determines extreme sea levels so tidal range amplification will increase extreme sea levels further, exacerbating flood risk (Figure 10b), while tidal range reduction will reduce it (Figure 10c). Therefore, tidal changes must be incorporated into future flood risk assessments (i.e., tidal changes should not be treated as negligible), in areas where the changes are likely large. There are two methods of including future tidal changes into estimates of extreme sea levels. The simplest is to make a linear offset to the present-day return periods in line with the projected tidal change, in the same way as is currently done to include MSL rise itself (e.g., Haigh et al., 2010b). This method assumes the surge climatology remains unaltered by the changing tide, which is a reasonable assumption (Mawdsley &amp; Haigh, 2016;Williams et al., 2016) but may not be correct for all coasts. The second method is to simulate the tide, surge, and MSL rise in a single model so that MSL-tide, tide-surge, and MSL-surge interactions are all included, for example, as done by Arns et al. (2015Arns et al. ( , 2017) ) for the German Bight. Future national flood assessments should include at least the first method, but it is only through downscaling from global tidal models, via the shelf, to estuarine models that estuarine tidal changes can be properly quantified. Tidal changes are very sensitive to coastal management practices along low-lying coasts, based on model scenarios that maintain fixed model coastlines or allow coastal recession with MSL rise (Pelling, Green, et al., 2013;Pelling, Uehara, et al., 2013;Pickering, 2014;Pickering et al., 2017). Methods to project coastline change on 100-year time scales are therefore required; studies such as Passeri et al. (2016) are making progress on this at regional scales using Bayesian Networks and decision-making trees, and others consider both geophysical and human factors influencing accommodation space with MSL rise (Schuerch et al., 2018).Coastal flooding is already a growing threat due to MSL rise (Church et al., 2013), and changes in tidal levels will affect flood risk: Tidal range, in addition to changes in MSL (Figure 10) determines extreme sea levels so tidal range amplification will increase extreme sea levels further, exacerbating flood risk (Figure 10b), while tidal range reduction will reduce it (Figure 10c). Therefore, tidal changes must be incorporated into future flood risk assessments (i.e., tidal changes should not be treated as negligible), in areas where the changes are likely large. There are two methods of including future tidal changes into estimates of extreme sea levels. The simplest is to make a linear offset to the present-day return periods in line with the projected tidal change, in the same way as is currently done to include MSL rise itself (e.g., Haigh et al., 2010b). This method assumes the surge climatology remains unaltered by the changing tide, which is a reasonable assumption (Mawdsley &amp; Haigh, 2016;Williams et al., 2016) but may not be correct for all coasts. The second method is to simulate the tide, surge, and MSL rise in a single model so that MSL-tide, tide-surge, and MSL-surge interactions are all included, for example, as done by Arns et al. (2015Arns et al. ( , 2017) ) for the German Bight. Future national flood assessments should include at least the first method, but it is only through downscaling from global tidal models, via the shelf, to estuarine models that estuarine tidal changes can be properly quantified. Tidal changes are very sensitive to coastal management practices along low-lying coasts, based on model scenarios that maintain fixed model coastlines or allow coastal recession with MSL rise (Pelling, Green, et al., 2013;Pelling, Uehara, et al., 2013;Pickering, 2014;Pickering et al., 2017). Methods to project coastline change on 100-year time scales are therefore required; studies such as Passeri et al. (2016) are making progress on this at regional scales using Bayesian Networks and decision-making trees, and others consider both geophysical and human factors influencing accommodation space with MSL rise (Schuerch et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Changes in tides will have important implications for thermal power plants and for tidal renewable energy schemes. Thermal power plants (which make up 82% of current global electricity generation) require a continuous water supply for "wet cooling" purposes. Therefore, tidal range increases could lead to the exposure of the existing intakes at low water. Further analysis of future tidal levels is required to establish how significant these range changes are in terms of maintaining a consistent supply of cooling water to power stations: in most cases increases in the maximum range are less than the MSL rise itself and extension of intake pipes into deeper water is usually straightforward. (Pickering et al., 2017). For tidal stream power, the cubic relationship between current velocity and tidal hydraulic power density (Hardisty, 2008), would lead to a 9% reduction in power generation. For tidal barrage power, owing to the quadratic relationship between tidal amplitude and hydraulic power density (MacKay, 2008), this would lead to a 19% reduction in power generation. Clearly sites with macrotidal conditions are particularly attractive for tidal barrage energy generation projects; these large amplitudes often occur where tides in estuaries are close to resonance. However, it is these resonant locations that are especially sensitive to tidal change. Tidal stream sites, on the other hand, tend to be between islands and around headlands where tides are strong but not necessarily resonant; tides in these locations may be less sensitive to nonastronomic changes. This along with the typically shorter lifespan of tidal stream sites means they may be less affected economically by tidal change than tidal barrages.Changes in tides will have important implications for thermal power plants and for tidal renewable energy schemes.

        <p>Temporal variability of tides could lead to changes in sediment transport, with a potential to influence coastal morphology in estuaries, and therefore shipping. The magnitude of sedimentation and erosion rates is correlated to the bed shear stress and hence the square of the tidal velocity (Gerritsen &amp; Berentsen, 1998).Temporal variability of tides could lead to changes in sediment transport, with a potential to influence coastal morphology in estuaries, and therefore shipping.

        <p>Consequently, even small changes in tidal range and tidal current velocities can influence coastal morphology (e.g., Chernetsky et al., 2010;Idier et al., 2017). For example, Gerritsen and Berentsen (1998) found that the MSL rise from -15 and -5 m to present day MSL reduced the erosion in the southern North Sea and increased it in the German Bight due to altered tidal dynamics. Investigations of future effects of MSL and changes in tides come to similar conclusions; see, for example, Jensen and Mudersbach (2005) and Masselink and Russell (2013). In estuaries (Bolle et al., 2010) and coastal lagoons (Araújo et al., 2008), changes to tidal asymmetry (flood-ebb dominance) could lead to associated changes in the sediment import or export. The link between increased tidal range and increased suspended sediment concentrations has been demonstrated for the Humber Estuary by Morris and Mitchell (2013). Also, depth changes in estuary may not be as large as the MSL rise itself because sediment may be imported or retained (rather than exported), depending on the local sediment supply. Failure of the sediment supply to match the rate of MSL rise would cause the estuary to "drown" (van Goor et al., 2003) as saltmarshes and spits recede or disappear as the morphology adjusts (Masselink &amp; Russell, 2013). Furthermore, changes to the tidal range in estuaries will alter the tidal prism, that is, volume of water exchanged between the estuary and the coastal waters, with effects of the residence time for pollutants in the estuary (e.g., Dyer, 1977).Consequently, even small changes in tidal range and tidal current velocities can influence coastal morphology (e.g., Chernetsky et al., 2010;Idier et al., 2017).

        <p>Many estuaries are critical arteries for the passage of shipping to major ports, stimulating local and national economies. Changes to tidal levels and to sedimentation have implications for both dredging operations and for navigation. For example, in Germany, navigation on the River Elbe is particularly dependent on water levels, with extended periods of low water (LW) reducing the length of the tidal cycle suitable for passage of deep draft vessels (Müller-Navarra &amp; Bork, 2011). Plans to manage the sediment transport patterns in the Elbe could be hampered by increased tidal ranges (von Storch &amp; Woth, 2008). Winterwerp et al. (2013) examined the tidal range evolution over the last century at five European ports with long narrow channels, where dredging and canalization has led to substantial (order of meters) increases in tidal range. These increased tidal ranges have caused problems with salt water intrusion, water quality, and increased turbidity, causing catastrophic changes in the local ecology (Winterwerp et al., 2013). A further deepening of an estuary could further exacerbate ecological problems. Many ports, such as Amsterdam in the Netherlands, are dependent on extensive lock systems as well as discharge sluices and pumping stations to create safe passage for shipping and to manage the landward water levels (Swinkels et al., 2010). Some docks have very narrow tolerances for vessel draft over the dock sills or limited clearance under bridges. Consequently, changes to tidal range, on top of a change in MSL, could change the length of the window of opportunity where safe passage could be made to the ports, as well as affecting the volume of water able to be discharged through sluices.Many estuaries are critical arteries for the passage of shipping to major ports, stimulating local and national economies.

        <p>Changes in tides could affect processes in shelf seas, which will influence primary production and fishers. Primary productivity is high in the seasonally stratified areas of shallow shelf seas due to the vertical mixing induced by (internal) tides (e.g., Sharples et al., 2007). The stratification of the water column in shelf seas plays an important role in primary productivity and hence draw down of atmospheric CO 2 through the biological carbon pump (Thomas et al., 2004). The position of tidal mixing fronts, which separate stratified and well-mixed waters, can be determined by the Simpson and Hunter criteria (1974):c = H/U 3 . Fronts in temperate shelf seas tend to sit on contours of c = 500, and even small changes in tidal current amplitudes thus have the potential to alter the position of tidal mixing fronts (Carless et al., 2016;Pickering, 2014;Wilmes et al., 2017), although to some extent small increases in U may be offset by the increased water depth. In areas with high freshwater runoff, changes to tidal mixing will also influence the buoyancy-stirring competition that determines regions of freshwater influence; future stratification will depend on alterations to estuarine discharge of freshwater (due to increased precipitation) and changes to the tidal and wind mixing. Changes in stratification also directly affect primary production in coastal seas (Sharples, 2008), which may have implications for higher trophic levels such as fish and apex predators that depend on seasonal phytoplankton blooms (Embling et al., 2012;Scott et al., 2010Scott et al., , 2013)). For example, some species of crustacean are extremely sensitive to the position of tidal mixing fronts: the Norwegian Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) exhibits larval retention over an area of muddy substrate for settlement and during the postlarval stage for burrowing (Hill et al., 1996). Any change in the baroclinic flows that retain the larvae could have a detrimental effect on the stocks of Nephrops which have an estimated value of £10 million per year to the Irish economies (Seafish, 2007) and £84 million to the Scottish economy (Scottish Government, 2012).Changes in tides could affect processes in shelf seas, which will influence primary production and fishers.

        <p>Another consequence of altered tides is that changes in the tidal driven mixing, especially in the abyssal ocean, has the potential to modify the strength of the global MOC with ramifications for global climate (e.g., Green et al., 2009). However, no investigations have yet shown a link between future change in tides and changes to the MOC, but large-scale changes of paleotides have possibly influenced the MOC (e.g., Green &amp; Huber, 2013;Munk &amp; Bills, 2007;Schmittner et al., 2015). 4.2.5. Intertidal Habitats Coastal habitats on rocky shores, estuaries, and saltmarshes are all strongly influenced by tidal conditions (Pugh, 1987), and changes in the MSL and MTR may therefore have implications for species that live in the intertidal zone. MSL rise will shift the intertidal zone inshore and changes in MTR will alter the spatial extent of the littoral zone, the current speeds, the bed type, the emersion/submersion curves, and the position of areas exposed during daylight. The natural response of estuaries to MSL rise is landward migration, and although coastal defenses may temporarily prevent this, the seaward edge of marshes and lower part of the intertidal zone would still erode, leading to a narrowing of the intertidal zone known as coastal squeeze (Masselink &amp; Russell, 2013). In such cases, managed realignment of the coastal flood defenses will be required if the intertidal habitat is to be maintained (Schuerch et al., 2018). Coastal squeeze will become a particular problem along coastlines with hard engineering schemes. For example, the Dutch and German Wadden Sea is a Ramsar wetland of international importance (1987) and a UNESCO world heritage site (2009). Substantial changes to the MSL and tidal range could have large impacts on these flat intertidal habitats, which are home to over 10,000 species of flora and fauna and a haven for 10-12 million migratory birds every year. The importance of tidal range in coastal marshes for feeding of wading birds is well established (Piersma et al., 2005). Coastal squeeze and reduced tidal range could also lead to the removal of nursery habitats in high velocity environments for macrobenthic fauna such as juvenile flatfish (Rabaut et al., 2013).Another consequence of altered tides is that changes in the tidal driven mixing, especially in the abyssal ocean, has the potential to modify the strength of the global MOC with ramifications for global climate (e.g., Green et al., 2009).

        <p>Other diverse habitats, such as mangroves, saltmarshes, and corals, which are all engineered by their inhabitants (Bertness &amp; Silliman, 2008), could be negatively impacted if MSL rise and tidal changes occurs faster than the biology can keep pace. The settling and survival of mangrove and saltmarsh seedlings depends on short, disturbance-free periods in order for roots to develop. Altered tidal dynamics could change the duration of these windows of opportunity. Seedling establishment at lower intertidal elevations is dependent on there being inundation-free periods, which would also be reduced by MSL rise and reduced tidal range (Balke et al., 2013). An additional implication of habitat loss in the coastal zone (e.g., mangroves) is the loss of their natural contribution to coastal flood defenses, and beaches where landward migration or increased erosion occurs may lead to mitigation attempts through beach nourishment programs, resulting in steeper beach slopes and loss of subtidal and intertidal habitats.Other diverse habitats, such as mangroves, saltmarshes, and corals, which are all engineered by their inhabitants (Bertness &amp; Silliman, 2008), could be negatively impacted if MSL rise and tidal changes occurs faster than the biology can keep pace.

        <p>This review has highlighted the considerable evidence that tidal amplitudes have changed and are continuing to change, due to nonastronomical factors. Over longer geological time scales it has been argued that variations in tides were driven by tectonic changes, which affected basin size and shape and hence the resonant properties of the basins. On shorter geological time scales, however, changes in tides were mainly due to variations in water depth, driven by large MSL fluctuations associated with glacial and interglacial cycles, and due to the extent of ice sheets. Over the 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, changes in tides are evident from water level records, with measured rates exceeding by far predictions related to orbital mechanics. Initially, these changes were observed at individual tide gauge sites and were thought to have arisen as a result of local natural and anthropogenic factors. However, a growing number of studies over the last decade have identified widespread, sometimes regionally coherent, positive, and negative trends in tidal constituents and levels that cannot be attributed to local mechanisms alone.This review has highlighted the considerable evidence that tidal amplitudes have changed and are continuing to change, due to nonastronomical factors.

However, since only a few studies have combined observations and models, or modeled at a temporal/spatial resolution capable of resolving both ultralocal and large-scale global changes, the individual contributions from local and regional mechanisms remain uncertain. It is thought that changes in water depth, due to climate-related MSL rise and isostatic crustal adjustments, does contribute to the recent observed change in tides. However, any link between tidal variability and MSL is far from a one-to-one correspondence, and local factors such as navigational development are clearly dominant in many ports. One might hope that progress in understanding tidal changes at seasonal and other time scales might lead also to greater understanding of longer-term changes, but the relationship between MSL variations and tidal fluctuations is often dependent on time scale. For instance, tidal range and MSL at San Francisco both show positive, century-scale trends (not necessarily causally related), while the two are negatively correlated on seasonal scales (Devlin, Jay, Talke, et al., 2017). This example emphasizes the importance of determining whether MSL and tidal trends are causally or incidentally related.

        <p>Over the last decade, modeling studies have presented projections of future tidal changes over the 21st century and beyond with changes in water depth, driven by MSL rise, and other factors (e.g., ice sheet extent and, to some extent, ocean warming). This body of work demonstrates that regionally coherent increases/decreases in the tide are likely to occur, over the next centuries in response to MSL rise, changes in coastal morphology, and variations in ice sheet extents. These tidal changes will particularly affect shelf seas and coastal waters. Changes are likely to be smaller than ±15% of MSL rise along most coastlines; however, at specific (often resonant) locations they can be larger.Over the last decade, modeling studies have presented projections of future tidal changes over the 21st century and beyond with changes in water depth, driven by MSL rise, and other factors (e.g., ice sheet extent and, to some extent, ocean warming).

Decisions about boundary conditions (e.g., river flow/buoyancy input) are also likely important. More modeling studies in these areas are clearly warranted.Efforts to directly compare and contrast modeling studies on future tidal characteristics are complicated by differences in numerical software across studies, boundary conditions, configuration settings, horizontal resolutions, forcing tidal constituents, MSL rise scenarios, and analytical tidal metrics.

        <p>: tidal waves which propagate at density differences within the ocean. They travel slowly compared with surface gravity waves and have wavelengths of only a few tens of kilometers, but they can have amplitudes at depth of tens of meters. Their sea surface height signals are smaller, typically of order 1-5 cm. The associated internal currents are termed baroclinic motions.: tidal waves which propagate at density differences within the ocean.
