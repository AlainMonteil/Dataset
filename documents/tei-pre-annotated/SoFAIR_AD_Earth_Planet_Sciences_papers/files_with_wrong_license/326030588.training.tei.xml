        <p>The rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) in tropical and subtropical locations is projected to accelerate from current trends of ~3.4 mm yr -1 to a mean estimate of ~5 mm yr -1 under lowemissions scenarios and ~10 mm yr -1 under high emissions scenarios by 2100 (1,2). Modelling of feedbacks between RSLR, vertical accretion, root mass formation, and tidal marsh and mangrove vulnerability under sustained high rates of RSLR is vital for the survival of these ecologically and economically important coastal environments (2). Some tidal marshes have been projected to survive RSLR of over 10 mm yr -1 where supported by high available suspended sediment concentrations (3), based on accretion data that span annual to decadal timescales.The rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR) in tropical and subtropical locations is projected to accelerate from current trends of ~3.4 mm yr -1 to a mean estimate of ~5 mm yr -1 under lowemissions scenarios and ~10 mm yr -1 under high emissions scenarios by 2100 (1,2).

        <p>Mangrove forests have initiated and drowned in association with variability in the rate of RSLR following the onset of deglaciation ~26,000 to 20,000 years ago (8). Prior to the Holocene, longterm RSLR rates of &gt;12mm yr -1 (8) exceeded the capacity of mangroves to maintain position insitu through vertical accretion, and mangroves were displaced landward (9), with few exceptions (10,11). During the early to mid Holocene, RSLR slowed in association with the final phase of deglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet (12). The rate of RSLR varied across the globe due to glacio-isostatic adjustment, the response of the solid Earth and gravity field to ice mass redistribution during a glacial cycle (13). Far-field sites, those distal from regions of former ice sheet extent and incorporating most of the tropics, exhibit a decline in the rate of RSLR (14) from from 10,000 to 7,000 years ago (Phase 1 in Fig. 1A), followed by stable or falling sea level to near current position from ~6000 years ago to present (Phase 2 in Fig. 1A). In contrast, at intermediate-field sites closer to centres of glaciation (for example, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean), sea level rose continuously throughout the Holocene due to isostatic response to melting of the Laurentide ice sheet. These coastlines have experienced a decelerating rate of RSLR from 10,000 years ago to the present (Fig. 1B and Figs. S5 andS6).Mangrove forests have initiated and drowned in association with variability in the rate of RSLR following the onset of deglaciation ~26,000 to 20,000 years ago (8).

        <p>The spatially-variable deceleration of RSLR from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago across tropical and subtropical latitudes coincided with the initiation of vertically continuous, organic-rich mangrove sediments several metres thick, as rising seas flooded shallow continental shelves (Phase 1 in Fig. 1A,B) (15). This deceleration provides an opportunity to explore whether: (i) the rate of mangrove vertical accretion responds to changes in RSLR; (ii) ice-sheet proximity (intermediate vs far field), geomorphic setting or tidal range constrain the capacity of mangroves to accrete in relation to RSLR; (iii) upper thresholds of mangrove vertical accretion can be detected; and (iv) mangrove development and vertical accretion correspond in timing to changes in the global atmospheric carbon budget.The spatially-variable deceleration of RSLR from 10,000 to 8,000 years ago across tropical and subtropical latitudes coincided with the initiation of vertically continuous, organic-rich mangrove sediments several metres thick, as rising seas flooded shallow continental shelves (Phase 1 in Fig. 1A,B) (15).

        <p>Slowing RSLR during the early to mid Holocene coincided with the initiation of extensive mangrove forests (Fig 1A, Phase 1; Fig. 3A,B). Our analysis suggests that sustained mangrove vertical accretion began across far-field regions (Africa, Asia, Australasia, South America) at ~10,000-8,000 years ago, and intermediate-field regions (Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico) at ~8,000-6,000 years ago (Fig. 3 and Figs. S1 andS2). Data were discriminated on the basis of ice-sheet proximity, geomorphic setting, and differentiated by tidal regime to explore differences in the timing of initiation and rates of vertical accretion (14). The intermediate-and far-field classifications, defined as a function of a location's proximity to areas of major ice sheet retreat during the last deglaciation, act as a surrogate variable for the temporal pattern of RSLR rates through the Holocene, which in turn influences the availability of accommodation space within which mangroves can accrete vertically. In a generalised linear model of several variables, only the proximity to former ice sheets proved to have a significant relationship with accretion rates (14).Slowing RSLR during the early to mid Holocene coincided with the initiation of extensive mangrove forests (Fig 1A, Phase 1; Fig. 3A,B).

        <p>We found a strong relationship (p&lt;0.001) between rates of mangrove vertical accretion and RSLR rate across all sites (51% of the variation in the accretion rate can be explained by the RSLR variation; Fig. 3). Mangrove vertical accretion first initiated at ~9,800 years ago in the Ganges-Brahmaputra River Delta, as RSLR reduced from ~9 mm yr-1 to ~6 mm yr -1 , and continued for ~650 years at high rates until replaced by subtidal deposits as RSLR increased again to &gt;7 mm yr -1 (14). Elsewhere in far-field locations, mangrove vertical accretion initiated as RSLR declined below ~7 mm yr -1 starting 8,800 years ago (Fig. 3). Rates of vertical accretion of &gt;6 mm yr -1 were sustained for over 1,000 years in mangrove forests in Australia, Africa, South America, Central America, and Asia (Fig. 2, Data S1), irrespective of geomorphic setting (Fig. S1).We found a strong relationship (p&lt;0.001) between rates of mangrove vertical accretion and RSLR rate across all sites (51% of the variation in the accretion rate can be explained by the RSLR variation; Fig. 3).

        <p>Mangrove vertical accretion initiated in intermediate-field regions later than in far-field locations, first in Belize ~7,800 years ago as RSLR fell below ~5mm yr -1 and in other Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico sites between 7,500 and 6,000 years ago (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and Table S1).Mangrove vertical accretion initiated in intermediate-field regions later than in far-field locations, first in Belize ~7,800 years ago as RSLR fell below ~5mm yr -1 and in other Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico sites between 7,500 and 6,000 years ago (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 and Table S1).</p>
        <p>This later initiation, in comparison to far-field regions, may be related to the limited allochthonous sediment supply available in the carbonate (reef) settings, although in Belize rates of accretion of over 6 mm yr -1 were observed at two sites (Data S1), driven by strong authochthonous inputs.This later initiation, in comparison to far-field regions, may be related to the limited allochthonous sediment supply available in the carbonate (reef) settings, although in Belize rates of accretion of over 6 mm yr -1 were observed at two sites (Data S1), driven by strong authochthonous inputs.</p>
        <p>We use a Bayesian framework to estimate the probability of initiation of mangrove accretion conditional upon rates of RSLR within the Holocene dataset (14). The empirical Holocene data (Data S1), which span a wide range of geomorphic settings and tidal regimes (Fig. S2), suggest that when RSLR rates exceed 6.1 mm yr -1 and 7.6 mm yr -1 , respectively, mangroves are very likely (&gt;90% probability) and extremely likely (&gt;95% probability) to be unable to initiate sustained accretion.

        <p>In most far-field locations (30 of 50), accretion and progrodation of the fluvial delta led to the replacement of mangrove by saltmarsh (characteristic of upper intertidal elevations), freshwater wetland, or terrestrial forest, often by the mid-Holocene when relative sea level stabilised (Data S1; Fig 1A Phase 2). For this reason, contemporary mangrove extent is highly contracted compared to the early-and mid-Holocene mangrove development in many major river deltas such as the Ord River, Australia, the Red River, Vietnam, and the Mekong River, Vietnam and Cambodia (15,(18)(19)(20). Mangrove accretion persisted significantly longer at intermediate-field locations (Fig. S2) because accommodation space was enhanced by glacio-isostatic adjustment.In most far-field locations (30 of 50), accretion and progrodation of the fluvial delta led to the replacement of mangrove by saltmarsh (characteristic of upper intertidal elevations), freshwater wetland, or terrestrial forest, often by the mid-Holocene when relative sea level stabilised (Data S1; Fig 1A Phase 2).

        <p>The extensive development of mangrove environments under RSLR has exerted a significant influence on global carbon cycles over geologic timescales (21) including, we suggest, during the early to mid Holocene (Fig. 4). Carbon balance modelling based on stable carbon isotope signatures suggests that the 5 p.p.m.v reduction in atmospheric CO2 in the early-Holocene was driven by increases in the uptake of carbon by the land biosphere on the order of 290 Pg C (22,23) prior to 7,000 years ago. The timing and volume of this uptake has been attributed to the northward expansion of boreal vegetation following ice-sheet retreat (~110 Pg C (24)), and organic soil development (180 Pg C ( 23)), of which circumarctic peatlands may have sequestered 20-60 Pg C based on the depth of peat formation at the time (24). We conservatively estimate a somewhat larger contribution (~85 Pg C) from mangrove carbon sequestration and burial over the period 8,600 to 6,000 years ago (14). The extensive development of mangrove forests over this period largely replaced methanogenic environments (freshwater wetlands and floodplains (Data S1; 25)) and corresponds to a declining rates of methane emission, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere (26). The  13 CH4 signals in the Southern Hemisphere for this period show a 1.5‰ depletion consistent with a replacement of vegetation utilising the C4 photosynthetic pathway (tropical grasslands and saltmarsh adapted to low atmospheric CO2) with mangroves utilising the C3 pathway (26,27).The extensive development of mangrove environments under RSLR has exerted a significant influence on global carbon cycles over geologic timescales (21) including, we suggest, during the early to mid Holocene (Fig. 4).

        <p>As RSLR increases in the 21 st century, an increase in the rate of mangrove vertical accretion, coupled with landward expansion as sea level rises can be expected to drive increases in the rate of carbon sequestration and preservation in mangroves environments, providing a negative feedback on radiative forcing, as suggested more broadly for coastal wetlands (7). While our results demonstrate that accretion in mangroves increases in response to RSLR, we found it was very likely (&gt;90% probability) that mangroves were unable to initiate sustained accretion when RSLR rates exceeded 6.1 mm yr -1 in any but the most sediment-laden settings. RSLR is projected to remain below 5 mm yr -1 under low emissions scenarios (RCP 2.6) throughout the 21 st century (1). However, RSLR is expected to exceed 5 mm yr -1 by 2030 and 7 mm yr -1 by 2050 under high emissions scenario RCP8.5 in low-latitude mangrove settings where rates of RSLR are expected to be higher than the global average (1,2).As RSLR increases in the 21 st century, an increase in the rate of mangrove vertical accretion, coupled with landward expansion as sea level rises can be expected to drive increases in the rate of carbon sequestration and preservation in mangroves environments, providing a negative feedback on radiative forcing, as suggested more broadly for coastal wetlands (7).

        <p>Where a deficit commences between vertical accretion and RSLR, time to submergence will be a function of the position of the mangrove within the tidal frame. In settings of low tidal range mangroves are more likely to be situated at elevations close to the threshold of submergence from the outset. In settings of high tidal range, mangroves are more likely to be situated at elevations well above this threshold, and tolerate a deficit between the rates of accretion and RSLR for decades to centuries (5). Geomorphic setting will also influence vulnerability to submergence, as allochthonous sediment contributions in tide-and river-dominated estuaries may provide an elevation subsidy not available in environments receiving low sediment supply, such as coral reefs. In this context, sediment retention in catchments impacted by water resource development (i.e., trapped behind dams) and local sediment controls may decrease mangrove resilience to RSLR in river estuaries (5). The natural response of mangrove encroachment across flooded coastal lowlands is therefore the main determinant of future extent (28), although this is already significantly impeded by coastal developments along many coastlines (29). Our findings therefore emphasise the importance of (i) mitigating the magnitude of rapid RSLR, and (ii) The dotted line shows the RSLR rate at which there is a 10% probability that mangroves can initiate accretion, and/or conversely that there is a 90% probability they are unable to initiate accretion.

        <p>We previously demonstrated that spatial and temporal variations in RSLR over the mid-to late-Holocene act as a global control on persistence of organic matter in coastal wetlands substrates (7). We hypothesise therefore that the duration of mangrove growth (as evidenced by continuous mangrove substrate within a given core) will vary between intermediate-field and far-field locations, with longer persistence in intermediate-field zones relative to far-field locations where RSLR stabilised several millennia earlier (NB Mangroves do not grow in near-field locations).We previously demonstrated that spatial and temporal variations in RSLR over the mid-to late-Holocene act as a global control on persistence of organic matter in coastal wetlands substrates (7).

        <p>The statistical analysis of RSLR is based on the glacio-isostatic adjustment modelling described above. We linearly interpolate relative sea level heights between the spatial and temporal predictions at sites and dates from the mangrove data using 
            <rs type="software">scipy</rs>'s interpolate package (39). We calculate RSLR rates using a linear transformation and approximate the rate distribution using kernel density estimation with sklearn.neighbors.kde (40,41) enabling the estimation of a cumulative distribution function (cdf) for each set of rates. We split all sites of mangrove accretion into two categories (intermediate-and far-field sites), based on their proximity to the former Laurentide Ice Sheet. Using 300-year average rates estimated every 100 years, we estimate RSLR during accretion times for far-field and intermediate-field sites by averaging RSLR at all sites where mangrove is within an accretion period (between the 95 th percentile of the beginning of accretion through the 5 th percentile of termination) (Fig. 3).

        <p>Most of the papers dealing with early to mid Holocene mangrove development in far field locations comment on a substantially greater mangrove aerial extent at this time compared to current distribution. These include major river deltas of Southeast Asia: the Song (20); the Mekong (72,76); the Malay-Thai Peninsula (69); west coast India (71); the macrotidal estuaries of northern Australia, reviewed in (15), and including the Ord (57), the Fitzroy (55), the South Alligator (59); mesotidal estuaries on the Australian east coast (52-54); the Ivory coast, Africa (82), Bragança Peninsula, Brazil (84), and the coastal plain of Suriname (93) and Venezuela (94). Mangrove extent contracted with infilling, to a degree difficult to constrain with the limited spread of point measures from the early Holocene. For this reason, and our limited understanding of Holocene distribution outside of these major deltaic systems, we have refrained from estimating early Holocene global mangrove extent. For our estimates of carbon sequestration from this time, we use the conservative value of current mangrove extent.Most of the papers dealing with early to mid Holocene mangrove development in far field locations comment on a substantially greater mangrove aerial extent at this time compared to current distribution.

        <p>We do not anticipate appreciable loss of carbon with depth in most of these settings during the transgressive phase. Carbon is efficiently retained in soils subject to rapid sea-level rise (7). This is because the depth of oxygen penetration in saturated soils is 1-10mm (21).

The deuterium stable isotope ratio (D-Es) of ice-core CH4 during the period suggests shifts in CH4 emissions to be dominated by tropical wetlands rather than geological emissions (45), consistent with local sea-level stabilisation forcing increases in the extent of freshwater wetland in Indonesia (46) and other large tropical systems (45). This corresponds to a period in which tropical mangroves were replaced by methanogenic wetlands (freshwater sedges) and rainforest following the stabilisation of sea levels in the Southern Hemisphere and the Indo-Pacific (Data S1).
