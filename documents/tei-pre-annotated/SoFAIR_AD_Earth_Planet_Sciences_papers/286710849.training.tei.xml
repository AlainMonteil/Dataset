        <p>Vegetation can contribute to coastal defence by damping incoming waves. However, prior studies have shown that attenuation varies greatly among plant species. Plant flexibility is a mechanical property that is commonly omitted, but varies considerably between shrubs and grasses on salt marshes. Therefore, we present an experimental study in a laboratory wave flume with artificial vegetation that differs in flexibility only. We measured wave attenuation and water particle velocities around rigid and flexible salt marsh vegetation. Waves were measured using a series of gauges and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure spatio-temporal variations of water particle velocities in the x-z plane around the vegetation. Our results show that flexible vegetation attenuates waves up to 70% less than rigid vegetation due to swaying of flexible plants. Furthermore, we find that rigid vegetation modifies the velocity structure, whereas flexible vegetation does not. Specifically, a mean current in the direction of wave propagation develops around the canopy and the horizontal particle velocities are amplified directly above the canopy. These results indicate that plant flexibility is a key parameter in the wave-vegetation interaction that controls wave damping and velocity structure.Vegetation can contribute to coastal defence by damping incoming waves.

        <p>Nature-based coastal defences in the form of vegetated foreshores are increasingly common in coastal protection schemes. The vegetation reduces the wave impact on natural beaches and coastal defence structures (Leonardi et al., 2018;M€ oller et al., 2014;Temmerman et al., 2013) and mitigates the impacts of storm surges (Wamsley et al., 2009). At the same time, they enhance natural habitats (Nordstrom, 2014), provide recreational opportunities (Foster et al., 2013), and act as a grazing area for cattle (Davidson et al., 2017).Nature-based coastal defences in the form of vegetated foreshores are increasingly common in coastal protection schemes.

        <p>Salt marshes are vegetated tidal wetlands that can be part of a nature-based coastal defence solution. The potential of their vegetation to damp waves has been shown in the field (Jadhav et al., 2013) and in large-scale experiments (Losada et al., 2016;M€ oller et al., 2014). Furthermore, they capture and bind sediments (Fagherazzi et al., 2012), which contributes to coastal stability (Bouma et al., 2014) and provides adaptation to sea level rise (French, 1993).Salt marshes are vegetated tidal wetlands that can be part of a nature-based coastal defence solution.

        <p>In an attempt to quantify the impact of vegetation on wave attenuation, computational modellers have proposed different approaches. Price et al. (1968) used a high viscous layer to model the impact of submerged seaweed. This approach was later extended by Mork (1996), who also included form drag from the canopy and near the substrate. Alternatively, Camfield (1983) studied the impact of vegetation on wind-driven wave growth via an enhanced bottom drag coefficient. Recent modelling studies have used this simple approach to simulate vegetation impacts on waves and storm surges (Stark et al., 2016;Wamsley et al., 2009). However, both approaches require additional formulations to relate plant properties to viscosity and bottom drag respectively.In an attempt to quantify the impact of vegetation on wave attenuation, computational modellers have proposed different approaches.

        <p>Using an alternative approach, Dalrymple et al. (1984) developed a direct relationship for wave attenuation as a function of wave and vegetation parameters. By simplifying the plant geometry to rigid cylinders and assuming the validity of linear wave theory (see e.g. Dean and Dalrymple, 1991 for details), a uniform bed and monochromatic wave trains, they quantified losses in wave energy due to work done by the drag force on the vegetation. Ultimately, they showed that this resulted in a reciprocal decay in wave height over a vegetation field. Mendez and Losada (2004) expanded on Dalrymple et al. (1984) by introducing new relations for random sea states and bed slope effects. Furthermore, they validated their work with kelp experiments by Dubi (1997). They showed that the bulk drag coefficient C D , hereinafter referred to as drag coefficient, is key in predicting wave attenuation by vegetation, because it is the only parameter that cannot be readily measured in the field and depends on the hydrodynamic conditions. It was shown that its value was inversely related to the Keulegan Carpenter number (KC; Mendez and Losada, 2004). Yet, the results cannot be easily expanded to other studies, because the drag coefficient also acts as a calibration parameter that compensates for the assumptions made, such as the simplification of the plant geometry.Using an alternative approach, Dalrymple et al.

        <p>The framework as set out by Dalrymple et al. (1984) and Mendez and Losada (2004) has been successfully applied in experiments with artificial and real salt marsh vegetation to obtain additional relations for the drag coefficient. For example, Jadhav et al. (2013) confirmed an inverse relation between the KC number and the drag coefficient based on measurements on a Spartina Alterniflora marsh. Alternatively, the drag coefficient has been related to the vegetation Reynolds number Re in experimental studies. This includes experiments with vegetation mimics, using a variety of materials, plant shapes and plant dimensions (Anderson and Smith, 2014;Augustin et al., 2009;Chen et al., 2018;Hu et al., 2014;Koftis et al., 2013;Ozeren et al., 2014;Phan et al., 2019), as well as experiments with real vegetation such as Puccinellia Maritima and Elymus Athericus (M€ oller et al., 2014) and Puccinellia Maritima and Spartina Anglica (Lara et al., 2016;Losada et al., 2016). Regardless of whether KC or Re is used, all studies found a reduction in drag coefficient for increased orbital wave particle velocities which are associated with higher waves.The framework as set out by Dalrymple et al.

        <p>However, a comparison by Vuik et al. (2016) revealed that for hydrodynamic conditions typical for a salt marsh, drag coefficients ranged from 0.13 to 5.75, which differ by a factor of 44. This indicates that hydrodynamic conditions are not a sufficient predictor for the drag coefficient. Submergence ratio (Anderson and Smith, 2014;Garzon et al., 2019;Mendez and Losada, 2004) and biomass (Maza et al., 2015) have been studied, but results are not consistent among experiments and both parameters are accounted for in the framework by Dalrymple et al. (1984) and Mendez and Losada (2004). This suggests that other parameters may be important.However, a comparison by Vuik et al.

        <p>Recently, Paul et al. (2016) have shown that plant flexibility may affect the potential of vegetation to attenuate waves, particularly when orbital velocities are low. Although their results have been obtained using a small quantity (max 8) of rectangular Lexaan strips instead of a full vegetation meadow, it has drawn attention to the potential importance of flexibility which varies greatly among plant species (Chatagnier, 2012). These observations are supported by the low drag coefficients reported in studies with flexible grasses (e.g. M€ oller et al., 2014). Furthermore, numerical modelling exercises have shown that plant swaying reduces the drag forces on flexible vegetation (Luhar and Nepf, 2016;M� endez et al., 1999;Mullarney and Henderson, 2010). However, Augustin et al. (2009) found no difference between rigid and flexible mimics. Therefore, additional research is needed on how plant flexibility affects wave attenuation.Recently, Paul et al.

        <p>Experimental results have also challenged the assumption that the velocity structure follows linear wave theory in the presence of vegetation. For instance, the orbital velocities were preferentially attenuated within meadows of wide rigid cylinders (Lowe et al., 2005;Pujol et al., 2013) and flexible vegetation (Luhar et al., 2010;Rupprecht et al., 2017). Furthermore, wave-averaged net currents were observed around artificial rigid (Abdolahpour et al., 2017;Hu et al., 2014;Pujol et al., 2013) and flexible (Abdolahpour et al., 2017;Luhar et al., 2010) vegetation patches. These modifications in the velocity structure directly impact the magnitude of the drag force and the work done by it.Experimental results have also challenged the assumption that the velocity structure follows linear wave theory in the presence of vegetation.

        <p>However, the magnitude of velocity attenuation and the direction and position of net currents differ between rigid and flexible vegetation. In an experiment with artificial rigid and flexible vegetation under equal wave conditions, Pujol et al. (2013) identified velocity attenuation by rigid vegetation only. Furthermore, rigid vegetation induces net currents in the direction of wave propagation through the top of the vegetation (Pujol et al., 2013) and flexible vegetation near the bottom (Luhar et al., 2010;Rupprecht et al., 2017).However, the magnitude of velocity attenuation and the direction and position of net currents differ between rigid and flexible vegetation.

        <p>Thus, plant flexibility may also be a key predictor for changes in wave-driven velocities, but much remains unclear in the absence of high-quality comparative data. Rigid and flexible vegetation with identical shapes have not yet been tested. Cylinders were used to mimic rigid vegetation (Abdolahpour et al., 2017;Hu et al., 2014;Lowe et al., 2005;Pujol et al., 2013) as opposed to blades (Abdolahpour et al., 2017;Luhar et al., 2010;Pujol et al., 2013) or real grasses (Rupprecht et al., 2017) for flexible vegetation. Furthermore, measurements have been restricted to points (Hu et al., 2014;Rupprecht et al., 2017) or cross-sections (Abdolahpour et al., 2017;Lowe et al., 2005;Luhar et al., 2010;Pujol et al., 2013).

        <p>Therefore, we tested wave attenuation by and the velocity structure around rigid and flexible vegetation meadows that differ in flexibility only. Plant parameters and wave conditions were directly derived from salt marshes in South Wales, UK to mimic realistic plant properties for this study. The salt marshes in South Wales exhibit diverse vegetation with large variation in plant stem flexibility, which is important to this study. As a further key element, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to measure the velocity structure in the x-z plane around vegetation.Therefore, we tested wave attenuation by and the velocity structure around rigid and flexible vegetation meadows that differ in flexibility only.

        <p>Let us define a coordinate system (Fig. 1), where the x-axis is in the direction of wave propagation with x ¼ 0 at the front edge and x ¼ L v at the back edge of the vegetation. Furthermore, the z-axis describes the vertical position with respect to the water column such that z ¼ 0 depicts the still water surface and z ¼ h the bed level. Herein, waves travel over a flat bottom with a vegetation field. Following Dalrymple et al.

Furthermore, sinusoidal waves with height HðxÞ and period T are imposed on the domain.Let us define a coordinate system (Fig. 1), where the x-axis is in the direction of wave propagation with x ¼ 0 at the front edge and x ¼ L v at the back edge of the vegetation.

It is assumed that the orbital water particle motion within this gap will not differ from its surroundings, which is validated by repeating each run without a gap in the vegetation.The vegetation plates were attached to the flume floor by suction cups at the plate centres, corners and edge centres.

        <p>Despite the presence of a wave damper at the end of the flume, the impact from wave reflection was significant. Therefore, only the time window unaffected by reflected waves was used in the data analysis. This was defined as the period between full wave development and the return of the first reflected wave to WG3 (M€ oller et al., 2014). Waves were considered fully developed when the water level reached 95% of the incident wave amplitude and at least five waves had passed. The return time was derived from shallow water wave theory. Four to eleven waves fell within the curtailed frame, depending on wave period and water depth. Therefore, each condition was run three times to obtain sufficient data: two times with a gap in the vegetation and one run without a gap.Despite the presence of a wave damper at the end of the flume, the impact from wave reflection was significant.

        <p>The rigid and flexible vegetation patches were subjected to 24 regular wave conditions (Table 1). Specifically, the wave height varied between 0.08 and 0.20 m, the wave period between 1.4 and 2.0 s, and the water depth between 0.60 and 0.30 m. A velocity scale, U; is defined as the maximum orbital velocity at stem centre (z ¼ h þ 1=2h v ) in front of the vegetation (x ¼ 0) based on linear wave theory. Each condition was run three times for both vegetation types. Finally, control runs without vegetation were conducted for cases R3, R13, R23 and R33.

        <p>Third, the hydrodynamics around salt marsh plants are controlled by the wake structures induced by the vegetation, expressed by vegetation Reynolds Number Re ¼ Ub v =ν (e.g. Nepf, 1999), in which ν is the kinematic viscosity. Alternatively, the Keulegan-Carpenter number KC ¼ UT=b v , which is effectively a ratio between wave excursion and stem diameter, has been identified as a predictor for the drag coefficient on cylinders (Keulegan and Carpenter, 1958). Re and KC fall within the range of field conditions (Table 2).

        <p>Fourth, plant swaying is induced by wave forcing on flexible vegetation. Luhar and Nepf (2016) showed that plant swaying under vegetation is controlled by the Cauchy Number Ca ¼ ρb v U 2 h 3 v =EI as the ratio of drag force over restoring forces due to stiffness, and the excursion ratio L ¼ h v =A w as the ratio between stem length over water particle excursion A w ¼ UT=ð2πÞ. Buoyancy may delay the onset of plant bending but is not expected to affect wave dynamics when wave forcing is significant (large Ca) (Henderson, 2019;Luhar et al., 2017;Luhar andNepf, 2016, 2011). The Cauchy numbers of rigid (Ca ¼ 0.04-0.20) and flexible (Ca ¼ 200-1000) mimics cover the range of real vegetation in South Wales (Ca ¼ 1.55-103) and those reported in the literature (e.g. Rupprecht et al., 2017 reported Ca ¼ 0.3-1000 for E.

        <p>The wave attenuation parameter β is obtained from the energy spectra that are derived from wave gauges in front of (WG1), halfway (WG2), and after (WG3) the artificial vegetation patch (Fig. 2a). Measured water surface elevation time series were curtailed to the maximum number of fully developed waves within the timeframe unaffected by reflection. We corrected for phase differences between each gauge in this process to obtain equivalent time series. These were used to calculate the wave energy spectra and, subsequently, zeroth spectral moment wave height H m;0 at each gauge.The wave attenuation parameter β is obtained from the energy spectra that are derived from wave gauges in front of (WG1), halfway (WG2), and after (WG3) the artificial vegetation patch (Fig. 2a).

As the observed wave motion predominantly behaved as a third-order stokes wave due to the limited water depth (Le M� ehaut� e, 1976), the particle velocity time series at each point in the x-z plane are derived using the three primary harmonics: the natural frequency and the first and second order higher harmonics (following e.g. Luhar and Nepf, 2016).

The gradient in the velocity field without vegetation indicates that u 0 slightly overpredicts bottom velocities (U * � 0:9 at the bottom). Therefore, both the normalized velocity amplitude and the no vegetation cases were used as velocity references. The velocity fields are averaged over tests with identical submergence ratios to generalize results. They are compared along transects T1 (x * ¼ 0:9), T2 (x * ¼ 1:1) and T3 (z * ¼ 1:05), which are strategically located inside, upstream of, and over the vegetation. As swaying of flexible vegetation prevented measurements inside the canopy, T1 is evaluated for rigid and no vegetation only.Fig. 9 displays the full normalized velocity field U * for case R13 with rigid, flexible and no vegetation.

        <p>Transect T1 highlights the impact of submerged rigid vegetation (α &lt; 1) on the vertical velocity structure with an amplification of orbital velocities above the canopy and attenuation within (Fig. 10a). A layer with increased velocity develops directly above the canopy with its peak where z * 2 ½1:0; 1:2� and diminishes further above the vegetation. Conversely, the velocity amplitude is reduced inside the vegetation patch. This reduction is the strongest in the layer directly below the canopy where z * 2 ½0:8; 1:0� and decreases near the bottom. However, an exception is the deep submerged case α ¼ 0:50 for which velocities are diminished strongly over the full vegetation column. The impact of emergent rigid vegetation is lower than submerged vegetation. The normalized velocity amplitude displays a gradient over the vegetation column, with higher velocities near the canopy and lower velocities near the bottom. This may be related to wave crests that still elevate above the canopy for given conditions.Transect T1 highlights the impact of submerged rigid vegetation (α &lt; 1) on the vertical velocity structure with an amplification of orbital velocities above the canopy and attenuation within (Fig. 10a).

        <p>The plant submergence ratio α appears to be a key parameter in quantifying the velocity structure, because it controls whether an amplified layer develops and the magnitude of the velocities therein.

Furthermore, the standard deviation of the normalized horizontal velocity structure is low (σ ¼ 0:02 0:08) at any given water depth despite variations in wave period and height.

        <p>Furthermore, we find that rigid vegetation can induce two types of flow circulation depending on the submergence ratio. A net downstream current develops around z * ¼ 1 for both submerged and emergent vegetation at transect T1 (Fig. 13a). This is compensated by an upstream current high above the canopy for deep submerged vegetation (α � 0:60) or within the vegetation for emergent and near-emergent vegetation (α � 0:75). The former results in a counter-clockwise circulation above the vegetation and the latter in a clockwise circulation through the vegetation.Furthermore, we find that rigid vegetation can induce two types of flow circulation depending on the submergence ratio.

The decrease in net horizontal velocities at transect T2 for rigid vegetation comes with an increase of net vertical velocities consistent with the rotational motion (Fig. 13c). A net upward velocity develops for deeper submerged rigid vegetation cases, which is associated with counter-clockwise motion. Alternatively, net downward currents develop below the canopy for the near-emergent case, which are consistent with clockwise rotation through the vegetation.

        <p>Stem flexural rigidity appears to be a key parameter for determining the drag coefficient for wave attenuation. Our results show that the drag coefficient of flexible vegetation is up to 70% lower than rigid vegetation under identical hydrodynamic conditions (Fig. 7). This decrease is of the same order as has been estimated previously. Mullarney and Henderson (2010) and Maza et al. (2013) studied the impact of plant swaying on drag force using numerical models. They found 70% and 50% reductions in drag coefficients respectively. Alternatively, Riffe et al. (2011) find 50% reduction in drag force for flexible vegetation in a field study. The magnitudes of the reductions in wave damping by flexible vegetation are in the same order of magnitude despite differences in plant morphology (cylindrical versus blades), wave conditions, and flexural rigidity of the flexible vegetation.Stem flexural rigidity appears to be a key parameter for determining the drag coefficient for wave attenuation.

        <p>The reduced wave damping capacity of flexible vegetation has been attributed to vegetation swaying. The physical explanation is two-fold. First, swaying of the vegetation reduces the frontal area of the vegetation. This reduces the total work that can be exercised by the drag force and, consequently, directly reduces the energy lost in a wave travelling over vegetation (Dalrymple et al., 1984). Secondly, the relative velocity between water and vegetation reduces when vegetation sways with the flow (M� endez et al., 1999). These effects are not accounted for in Eq. ( 5) and will thus lead to a lower calibrated drag coefficient.The reduced wave damping capacity of flexible vegetation has been attributed to vegetation swaying.

First, we found that drag coefficient for flexible vegetation correlated equally well to predictors that related to wave conditions only, whereas the drag coefficient for rigid vegetation only related well to predictors that did include stem diameter (Fig. 8). This indicates that flexible vegetation follows flow and rigid vegetation controls flow. Furthermore, M€ oller et al. ( 2014) found low drag coefficients for plants with low flexural rigidities. Also, they were observed to sway significantly (Rupprecht et al., 2017). In a separate study on a limited number of plant mimics, Paul et al. (2016) also identified the reduction in stem frontal area via stem bending as a key parameter in the prediction of the drag coefficient.The negative impact of plant swaying on wave attenuation is supported by our experimental results and literature.

        <p>Wave-averaged velocity fields from our experiment show that the mean currents drive a circulation over or through rigid vegetation, depending on the submergence ratio (Fig. 14). Like prior studies (Abdolahpour et al., 2017;Pujol et al., 2013), we find a mean current in the direction of wave propagation around the canopy. This net downstream current has been associated with boundary layer streaming, which follows from the shear stresses at the top of the vegetation (Luhar et al., 2010;Pujol et al., 2013). As the flume is a closed system, a mean current in the direction of wave propagation must be compensated for by a return flow. Under sufficiently submerged conditions (α � 0:60), the return flow occurs in the region between the top of the vegetation canopy and free surface. However, as a vegetation-free region is not available under shallow conditions (α � 0:75), the return flow passes through vegetation itself. This results in an anti-clockwise circulation, when current returns above the canopy (Fig. 14, top row) or a clockwise circulation through the vegetation, when the current returns inside the canopy (Fig. 14, middle row).Wave-averaged velocity fields from our experiment show that the mean currents drive a circulation over or through rigid vegetation, depending on the submergence ratio (Fig. 14).

        <p>Disagreements may be related to the difference in the geometry of vegetation used in the two studies. Luhar et al. (2010) used blades instead of stems where six blades were attached to a single point in the flume bottom. Therefore, the stem spacing can be wider near the bottom than in the canopy, which may promote convergence of the current in this area. Also, the higher frontal area for blades (up to λ f ¼ 4:2) as opposed to cylinders (λ f ¼ 1:7) may have contributed to the different observations (Abdolahpour et al., 2017). Differences between rigid and flexible vegetation are consistent with Abdolahpour et al. (2017). They developed an empirical relation for the magnitude of wave-driven currents as function of the vertical particle excursion, plant dimensions and drag coefficient. Specifically, the drag coefficient correlates positively to the magnitude of the wave-driven currents. Our results show that rigid vegetation has a higher drag coefficient than flexible vegetation and will therefore develop significant net currents at lower vegetation densities and wave heights.Disagreements may be related to the difference in the geometry of vegetation used in the two studies.

        <p>The presence of flow circulations around vegetation implies that the wave-current field is not uniform and irrotational. The vegetation patch acts, from a hydrodynamic perspective, as a source of vorticity. This may affect wave shape and, thereby, Equations (1)-( 5) which assume a sinusoidal wave shape (Dalrymple et al., 1984). A detailed analysis of the wave shape and its implications is beyond the scope of this study, but it may have affected the drag coefficient which acts as calibration parameter.The presence of flow circulations around vegetation implies that the wave-current field is not uniform and irrotational.

In this study, U=ωS v ¼ Oð10 2 Þ and S v =b v ¼ 6 relate to inertia dominated flow with large stem spacing. Both contribute to low velocity attenuation within the canopy. For example, Lowe et al.

        <p>We propose that water layers with the amplified/diminished velocities above and below the canopy, which were observed in detail for the first time in this study, follow from an unsteady wave-induced net current (Section 5.2). This is shown by analysing horizontal particle velocity differences between run R13 with rigid vegetation and without vegetation for five wave cycles (Fig. 15). The net current that results from the wave-vegetation interaction can be clearly identified by the red colour around the canopy (black dashed line). This current flows above and below the canopy over a wave cycle. Specifically, the current acts above the canopy when a wave crest passes and below when a trough passes. Thus, it appears at a constant relative depth such that the mean depth is at the vegetation canopy.We propose that water layers with the amplified/diminished velocities above and below the canopy, which were observed in detail for the first time in this study, follow from an unsteady wave-induced net current (Section 5.2).

        <p>As the mean current is in the direction of wave propagation, it is aligned with the horizontal orbital velocities at wave crests, leading to velocity amplification directly above the canopy.

The observed attenuation is around 20% (Fig. 10a) and C D ∝U 3 when derived through wave height measurements (Eqs. ( 1), ( 3) and ( 5)). Therefore, we estimate</p>
        <p>At KC ¼ 133 which is the conservative limit of our range, C SD ¼ 1:63. Furthermore, λ f ¼ 1:67 and λ p ¼ 0:022. We find that L D � 0:22m and L v =L D ¼ 6:9 (in-canopy velocity measurements at 6:2L D ). Lowe et al. (2005) find that the adjustment length is 3L D -5L D which is satisfied by our experimental conditions. Our experimental results the along horizontal transect T3 (Fig. 12) also suggest the velocity structure has adjusted to the presence of vegetation as the velocity amplitude remains constant over the back section of the vegetation which has been the focus of our measurements. Finally, we note that the observed wave damping over the vegetation field is significant as it ranges between 2% and 25% depending on vegetation and wave conditions.At KC ¼ 133 which is the conservative limit of our range, C SD ¼ 1:63.

        <p>Most natural salt marsh vegetation exhibits a mix of rigid shrubs and flexible grasses. These mixed marshes are not only beneficial for biodiversity, but combined rigid and flexible vegetation is complementary to coastal protection. While both attenuate wave energy, the damping capacity of rigid vegetation exceeds that of flexible vegetation. Foreshores with rigid vegetation can be up to 70% thinner than foreshores with flexible vegetation to provide the same level of protection. It is expected that the level of protection that semi-flexible vegetation provides will be between the limits of rigid and flexible vegetation. Furthermore, the wave-induced currents in rigid vegetation patches can promote sediment transport to the higher marshes, potentially increasing marsh accretion. This may enable marshes to increase elevation to combat potential impacts of sea level rise and can act as a buffer against extreme events. Alternatively, swaying of flexible plants can prevent stem breaking (Rupprecht et al., 2017;Vuik et al., 2018). Therefore, flexible species can be expected to remain effective during higher wave energy conditions. However, the differences in plant flexibility have to be considered when modelling the impact of mixed vegetation salt marshes on hydrodynamics and wave height. Much research effort has been invested in finding single relations to predict a drag coefficient for salt marshes (e.g. Losada et al., 2016;M€ oller et al., 2014). While these have led to useful relationships and have proven the capacity to model wave attenuation, the relations may only be applicable for a specific set of species, or rather a specific combination of plant flexibilities used in such experiment.Most natural salt marsh vegetation exhibits a mix of rigid shrubs and flexible grasses.

        <p>In contrast, this study has identified different wave-vegetation interactions between the rigid and flexible limits and provides drag coefficients associated with these limits. Although the mimics have been based on the South Wales salt marshes, the results show wave attenuation to be a function of plant flexibility. The range of flexural rigidities in South Wales is wide and also covers, for instance, the species in US salt marshes (Chatagnier, 2012;Feagin et al., 2011). Therefore, our results have a wider application.In contrast, this study has identified different wave-vegetation interactions between the rigid and flexible limits and provides drag coefficients associated with these limits.

        <p>A laboratory study under controlled conditions using artificial rigid and flexible vegetation has provided us with the opportunity to study the impact of plant flexibility on the drag coefficient and the velocity structure. For the first time, we test mimics that differ in flexural rigidity only under conditions that have been directly derived from the field. We have selected rigid and flexible vegetation mimics that represent a wide range of plant flexibilities found in typical South Wales salt marshes. Drag coefficients were derived from measured wave attenuation and, as a further novelty, we have measured the velocity field in and around the vegetation using PIV.A laboratory study under controlled conditions using artificial rigid and flexible vegetation has provided us with the opportunity to study the impact of plant flexibility on the drag coefficient and the velocity structure.

        <p>Our results show that both rigid and flexible vegetation damp waves, but rigid vegetation provides superior damping. This is expressed via a drag coefficient; i.e. a higher drag coefficient means stronger damping. We find that the drag coefficient for flexible vegetation is up to 70% lower than for rigid vegetation. Plant swaying of flexible vegetation reduces the plant frontal area and the relative velocity difference between plants and water. Both have a negative effect on the drag forces and associated energy losses. As a result, swaying flexible plants will Fig. 15.

        <p>Furthermore, we find that rigid vegetation alters the velocity structure, while flexible vegetation does not. Specifically, the interaction between waves and rigid vegetation induces a current in the direction of wave propagation through the top of the vegetation. This current propagates above and below the canopy in phase with the water surface. For submerged vegetation, this results in amplified horizontal particle velocities above the vegetation canopy and reduced velocities within the vegetation. The magnitude of the current and the amplification depend on submergence ratio. A stronger current and amplification develop for higher submergence ratios. Finally, a return current develops high in the water column when the vegetation is sufficiently submerged or, otherwise, through the meadow.Furthermore, we find that rigid vegetation alters the velocity structure, while flexible vegetation does not.

        <p>Based on these outcomes, it can be concluded that different salt marshes may provide different levels of protection against wave action, depending on the flexibility of established species. A single drag coefficient for salt marshes may not exist. Plant flexibility appears to be a key control parameter when defining a drag coefficient for a given salt marsh. This study has set out the limits and impacts of the latter, but additional research is required to further quantify the impact of plant flexibility and associated swaying to predict drag coefficients for a wide range of habitats. The next step would be to search for a governing relation between drag coefficient and plant flexibility, which will be addressed in a follow-on study.Based on these outcomes, it can be concluded that different salt marshes may provide different levels of protection against wave action, depending on the flexibility of established species.

        <p>Salt marshes in South Wales are generally sheltered and exhibit a mix of shrubby and grassy species, among which Atriplex Portulacoides, Spartina Anglica, Festuca Rubra, Puccinellia Maritima, and Aster Tripolium are most common. Data for these species has been obtained from field campaigns in the Taf (August 2017) and Neath (April 2018) estuaries. These two estuaries are typical of small, macro-tidal estuaries found in Wales, UK which contain a substantial expanse of salt marshes. Plant density was measured in the field and at least 9 samples of each specie were brought to the lab for further analysis from both sites (Table A1).Salt marshes in South Wales are generally sheltered and exhibit a mix of shrubby and grassy species, among which Atriplex Portulacoides, Spartina Anglica, Festuca Rubra, Puccinellia Maritima, and Aster Tripolium are most common.
