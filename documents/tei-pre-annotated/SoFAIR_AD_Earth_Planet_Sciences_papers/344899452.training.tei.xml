        <p>The effective implementation of preventive conservation approaches demands the employment of standardized and robust tools able to integrate the data coming from multiple sources, inspection and diagnosis techniques, as well as to ensure the proper information transfer between expert and non-expert users. Aiming to make a step forward in the state of the art of current conservation approaches, a cutting edge Web-GIS technology resorting to the intuitiveness of 360° panoramas and 3D point clouds in combination with the Internet of Things is presented in this work, demonstrating how physical and digital worlds can be linked for proper documentation and management of cultural heritage. To validate such a pioneering approach, one of the most representative and complex heritage buildings of Spain is used as a case study: the General Historical Library of Salamanca.The effective implementation of preventive conservation approaches demands the employment of standardized and robust tools able to integrate the data coming from multiple sources, inspection and diagnosis techniques, as well as to ensure the proper information transfer between expert and non-expert users.

        <p>Preventive conservation can be considered as the most efficient approach for maintaining and protecting heritage buildings and sites [1][2][3]. Unlike remedial approaches, this strategy is able to save between 40% and 70% of the total maintenance costs by avoiding major interventions and promoting systematic inspections and monitoring routines [2]. However, its effective implementation entails different challenges [3], demanding the use of standardized and integrated workflows for documentation, registration and management of the information along with proper communication protocols between technicians (expert users) and buildings' owners/managers (non-expert users) [4]. In the light of these considerations, and given the absence of a systematic policy, the European project HeritageCare (Monitoring and preventive conservation of historic and cultural heritage, ref. SOE1/P5/P0258) has been promoting the implementation of a hierarchical digital-based preventive conservation system in South-West Europe. This system draws inspiration from the Flemish Monumentenwacht [5,6] -a public organization which influences daily maintenance practices in The Netherlands and Flanders -but introduces new substantial developments in the form of digital tools to keep abreast of the times and enhance the quality of the services provided [4]. The HeritageCare system relies on three complementary levels of services, whose main pillar is a systematic inspection and monitoring process supported by the latest advances in digitization and smart technologies (e.g. photogrammetry, drones, laser scanning or Building Information Modelling, among others [7]). Service Level 1 (SL1 or StandardCare) aims at providing a feasible, low-cost and rapid condition assessment of the heritage buildings; Service Level 2 (SL2 or PlusCare) is devoted to integrating the information collected during SL1 with an in-depth condition assessment of the building and its indoor assets, including the monitoring of the most relevant physical and mechanical parameters; finally, Service Level 3 (SL3 or TotalCare) integrates and manages all data gathered from SL1 and SL2Preventive conservation can be considered as the most efficient approach for maintaining and protecting heritage buildings and sites [1][2][3].

        <p>The integration of information from different inspection and diagnosis techniques, core of the PlusCare protocol, is reached through the geoinformatics [8]. This discipline, which includes data acquisition methods such as photogrammetry, laser scanning or remote sensing, promotes the use of geoinformation approaches, for preserving cultural heritage, like Geographical Information Systems (GIS) or Building Information Models (BIM) [8]. The former are rooted in the employment of a geospatial database that is able to store a great variety of alphanumeric information as well as raster and vectorial products, all of them properly geolocalized [9]. Thanks to this ability, there are plenty of applications that use GIS for heritage preservation at city [10,11] and building levels [12][13][14] in which the information can be filtered according to different criteria.The integration of information from different inspection and diagnosis techniques, core of the PlusCare protocol, is reached through the geoinformatics [8].

        <p>Complementary to GIS and BIM, several authors have proposed in the last few years the use of virtual tours as potential tools for integrating information related with the valorisation and conservation of heritage [18][19][20]. The main advantages of these tools are the intuitiveness of the output -obtained by means of 360° spherical projections -and its low-cost, requiring only the use of digital cameras equipped with fisheye lenses or even as-built 360° cameras [18][19][20]. This way, the information contained within the heritage system is statically loaded through the software used for generating the virtual tour. Among these applications, it is worth highlighting the work carried out by Sánchez Aparicio et al.

        <p>Taking into consideration these developments, the HeritageCare project aimed to make a step forward towards the systematic implementation of a digital-based preventive conservation system for the historical and cultural heritage in Southwestern Europe. To this end, a new WEB-GIS tool was developed to exploit the potentialities offered by the geoinformatics through the combination of the latest advances in virtualization, Internet of Things (IoT) -i.e. monitoring networks, and interoperability protocols. All these technologies are blended into a unique web platform called 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs> system, integral part of the HeritageCare platform. The system is complemented by a robust geospatial database that allows for advanced queries in order to improve the user experience through immersive virtual tours across the heritage.

        <p>After describing the main goals of the PlusCare protocol in Section 2, together with the methods and materials used to develop and implement it, Section 3 discusses the application of this tool to the General Historical Library of the University of Salamanca, one of the most relevant heritage structures within the Spanish territory. Thereafter, Section 4 describes the user experience using the PlusCare system.

        <p>As highlighted in the introduction, the main goal of this work is to show in detail the development phase of the PlusCare protocol, which corresponds to the second service level (SL2) of the HeritageCare method. This level is conceived to increase the knowledge of the inspected heritage buildings and related indoor assets, integrating and complementing the information collected in SL1. The protocol includes two similar workflows depending on the existence or not of a previous SL2 inspection (Figure 1). In either case, the application of the PlusCare protocol depends upon the execution of a prior SL1 inspection and it is a mandatory stage for the application of the subsequent inspection level (SL3).As highlighted in the introduction, the main goal of this work is to show in detail the development phase of the PlusCare protocol, which corresponds to the second service level (SL2) of the HeritageCare method.

        <p>The selection of the service level depends on the conservation needs of the building as well as on the owner's requirements/financial availability. For a thorough description of the workflow and tools required to implement the first and third levels of service (SL1 and SL3), the reader is referred to Masciotta et al. [4].The selection of the service level depends on the conservation needs of the building as well as on the owner's requirements/financial availability.

        <p>The efficient implementation of the 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs> protocol required the development of a tool able not only to integrate different data sources (including the IoT), but also to provide an intuitive environment from which buildings' owners and managers (non-expert users) could access all the significant information for the effective preventive conservation of their heritage. To make this possible, a novel Web-GIS system was created: 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs>. Such a tool combines the latest advances in geodatabase models, interoperability protocols and digitalization strategies, to enable the proactive conservation of historical constructions. Figure 2 shows the flowchart of the system as well as its main engines. As schematized, the 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs> system converges into a dual web environment: i) one for expert users; ii) another for non-expert users. Both environments will be detailed in the following sections.
        </p>
        <p>The main functionality of the expert-user environment is to store all the technical information collected prior, during and after HeritageCare inspections with the aim of better addressing the specific needs of the buildings and designing proper preventive conservation plans. This environment was developed with different web-based languages, such as PHP and JavaScript (programming language), HTML (markup language) and CSS (design language), among others.The main functionality of the expert-user environment is to store all the technical information collected prior, during and after HeritageCare inspections with the aim of better addressing the specific needs of the buildings and designing proper preventive conservation plans.

        <p>Due to the multiple and heterogeneous information progressively gathered through the application of the HeritageCare method, the platform was conceived to include several tabs according to the nature of each information source. With specific reference to the PlusCare system, after inserting a few general data about the inspection (e.g. date, duration, tools and methodologies, etc.), specific information is demanded (Figure 3): i) assets; ii) panorama photos; iii) monitoring data; iv) point This paper can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103304 clouds; v) data records; vi) damages. The right body of the environment shows all the fields that the expert user needs to fill in depending on the tab selected on the left sidebar. It is worth recalling that SL2 fields can only be filled upon completion of the SL1 inspection report of the building under consideration, namely after the application of the StandardCare protocol to that building. This 'restriction' is intrinsic to the HeritageCare method, as the system consists of three sequential service levels, where each level includes the previous one and adds new information for a more extended knowledge of the heritage ensemble. Further details in this regard can be found in Ramos et al. [21] and Morais et al. [7].Due to the multiple and heterogeneous information progressively gathered through the application of the HeritageCare method, the platform was conceived to include several tabs according to the nature of each information source.

        <p>The proper execution of the PlusCare level involves an in-depth evaluation of the conservation state of the assets found within the heritage building/site. Based on a common cataloguing framework, assets are classified into four different groups: i) main integrated objects; ii) exceptional integrated objects; iii) main movable objects; iv) exceptional movable objects. Each of these groups includes a total of twelve categories, as exposed by Masciotta et al. [4].The proper execution of the PlusCare level involves an in-depth evaluation of the conservation state of the assets found within the heritage building/site.

        <p>• Asset identification: this first part includes all the general metadata related to the inspected object, such as the asset name or the asset category, among others.

        <p>• Environmental assessment: this section comprises a few key information related to the environmental conditions at the moment of the asset inspection: i) main bioclimate indicators: luminosity, temperature and relative humidity; ii) environmental condition classification; iii) specific comments for the owner; and iv) possible consequences if the condition is not maintained.

To this end, the platform is linked to the HeritageCare Damage Atlas, which represents a fundamental supporting tool for the preliminary diagnosis of the observed pathologies during inspection activities as well as for the identification of appropriate mitigation actions (Figure 5b). For more details about the Damage Atlas, refer to Masciotta et al. [4]. For each identified damage, the technician has to report information related to its severity and risk, as well as a short description of the damage with complementary images and further comments on possible consequences, if no action is undertaken, or recommendations to prevent the damage progression.• Assessment of the conservation state: this section includes the damage affecting the assets.

        <p>The form entitled Panorama photos is devoted to the storage of 360° images for the generation of the virtual tour of the heritage building/site (Figure 4b). The technician only needs to upload the panoramic photos in one of the most common formats, such as .JPG, .PNG or .TIFF, together with the location in which each panoramic image was taken, and a short description of the protocol used for data acquisition and data processing.The form entitled Panorama photos is devoted to the storage of 360° images for the generation of the virtual tour of the heritage building/site (Figure 4b).

        <p>The virtual tour is generated in the external low-cost solution Pano2VR®. In order to adapt this software to the requirements of the platform, the in-house plugin HeritageCare4Pano2VR was created (Figure 6a). Some extra features were added for preventive conservation purposes, namely a menu integrating a direct link to the SL1 inspection report as well as to the 3D point cloud of the building/site, and the possibility of creating hotspots of damages, assets, monitoring points and data records linked to the corresponding information stored in the HeritageCare database.The virtual tour is generated in the external low-cost solution Pano2VR®.

        <p>It is worth mentioning that each time the technician uploads new information to the platform and fills the fields corresponding with its spatial location, the platform creates a new hotspot inside the virtual tour which is directly linked to a HTML page containing all the relevant information concerning that specific hotspot. The damages detected during SL1 inspection can be also georeferenced by adding their coordinates to the corresponding label (Figure 6b).It is worth mentioning that each time the technician uploads new information to the platform and fills the fields corresponding with its spatial location, the platform creates a new hotspot inside the virtual tour which is directly linked to a HTML page containing all the relevant information concerning that specific hotspot.

        <p>Hence, the PlusCare system includes a specific tab to store and manage all the information associated to the monitoring sensor network installed in the inspected heritage building. In this regard, the technician needs to specify (Figure 7a): i) the identification number of the nodes composing the network; ii) the monitored parameters measured by each node; iii) the date of installation; iv) the main technical characteristics of the sensor; v) the type of connection; vi) the weight and dimensions of the nodes; vii) the maintenance requirements. Regarding the second label, i.e. the monitored quantities, the current version of the PlusCare system offers a total of 27 different parameters, including bioclimate (e.g. temperature, CO2, luminosity or relative humidity), structural (e.g. inclination, crack width or maximum acceleration) and biological (e.g. presence of xylophagous) parameters.Hence, the PlusCare system includes a specific tab to store and manage all the information associated to the monitoring sensor network installed in the inspected heritage building.

        <p>To obtain the information associated with the periodic or continuous measurements recorded by the sensors, the PlusCare system implements a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) communication protocol between the platform itself and the server that stores the monitoring data [22]. In this file, the information demanded by the platform concerns the node identification number, the measured parameters, the values captured by the different sensors placed within the same node, and the sensor status. This latter is used to apply a specific colour grade to each monitored parameter in the non-expert user environment. To this end, the PlusCare protocol resorts to the use of key-performance indicators (KPIs) in order to define different threshold ranges for which the structural behaviour of the building or its environmental conditions can be considered good, acceptable or non-acceptable [23][24][25]. These KPIs are defined within the monitoring server, which sends this information in the form of integer values to the PlusCare system. These values range from 0 to 2 according to the detected degree of risk/acceptability: 0 for a good status; 1 if a potential risk exists; and 2 if the risk is high.To obtain the information associated with the periodic or continuous measurements recorded by the sensors, the PlusCare system implements a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) communication protocol between the platform itself and the server that stores the monitoring data [22].

        <p>This form is conceived for the inspector to upload the whole 3D point cloud of the heritage building/site.

        <p>The current version of the 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs> system implements the 
            <rs type="software">Potree</rs> library [26], since it allows to render large point clouds through the use of an Octree visualization system.

Besides, 
            <rs type="software">Potree viewer</rs> is able to integrate, by means of the so-called annotations, graphical and text information within the point cloud [26]. This feature is used by the system to plot relevant information on the 3D point cloud, thus creating a dynamic 3D model.
        </p>
        <p>According to what exposed hitherto, the inspector needs to upload the point cloud and then the platform automatically computes the Octree structure. For documentation and management purposes, the technician is also required to insert information about the name of the place digitalized, its location, the date of collection as well as a short description about the capturing and processing of data (Figure 7b).According to what exposed hitherto, the inspector needs to upload the point cloud and then the platform automatically computes the Octree structure.

        <p>As highlighted in the introduction, the success of any preventive conservation plan passes through the proper and fluid communication between the technician(s) and the owner or manager of the heritage building/site. In order to facilitate this transfer of information, the 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs> system includes a non-expert user environment that allows to consult all essential data reflecting the This paper can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103304 conservation state of the inspected historical artefact in a friendly way. The intuitiveness of this environment originates from the use of 360° photos and a 3-colour grading scale that automatically rates the acceptability and degree of risk of the monitored values. This imagery input is enclosed into an improved virtual tour with a geospatial database that enables to access the information related to the inspections carried out by the technicians. Accordingly, the interface integrates two main sections (Figure 9): i) a left sidebar showing all the information accessible from the database; ii) a right section including the virtual tour composed by 360° panoramic images in spherical projection with pre-defined hotspots associated with the assets, monitoring nodes, data records and damages created by the inspector in the expert-user environment. This graphical user interface is complemented by a bottom navigation bar that allows to consult the 3D point cloud of the site and the SL1 condition report (Figure 10a). As shown in Figure 9, this navigation bar includes nine different groups of buttons (from left to right): i) button a to show/hide the map; ii) button b to enable/disable the gyroscope app; iii) button c to visualize the environment in full-screen mode; iv) button d to see or hide the hotspots of the virtual tour; v) group of buttons e to move the panoramas up, down, left and right; vi) button f to load the SL1 condition report; vii) button g to connect the virtual tour with the 3D point cloud viewer; viii) button h to define the language; and ix) button i to hide/unhide the sidebar menu. It is worth mentioning that the platform includes a specific library for reading the data coming from the inertial units of mobile devices (tablets/smartphones). The use of this library makes possible to generate an augmented reality system since it lets synchronize the real point of view of the user with the virtual point of view of the platform.

        <p>Complementarily, the platform stores in hidden fields the associated spatial data, namely: i) number of panoramas; ii) pan and tilt angles. These data permit, by means of a JavaScript order, to place the point of view of the virtual tour directly in the area to which the information belongs (e.g. if users click on node 1, the platform places the point of view of the virtual tour in the area where node 1 is located). This information is showed in a 360° environment through the so-called hotspots. Each hotspot includes information about a particular asset, damage, test record or monitoring node, generally in the form of a simple and easy-to-read report (Figure 10b and Table 1). Additionally, each hotspot has a direct link to the 3D point cloud viewer where pertinent data about the consulted item are shown.Complementarily, the platform stores in hidden fields the associated spatial data, namely: i) number of panoramas; ii) pan and tilt angles.

        <p>During the project, the HeritageCare method and its related tools were successfully tested across a considerable number of heritage buildings in Southwestern Europe. Particularly, the PlusCare system was first validated in Spain with the General Historical Library of the University of Salamanca. This building belongs to the well-known Escuelas Mayores, declared a Place of Cultural Interest in 1931 (Figure 12a). It is located in the historical centre of Salamanca and dates from the 15 th century. The construction suffered several alterations along the history. Nowadays, its main façade is considered the best piece of Spanish artworks executed in Plateresque style (Figure 12b), being the symbol of the third oldest university still in operation in the world, as well as the oldest university in Spain. The General Historical Library stands behind this remarkable façade. It features a squared plan with a length of 41 m and a width of about 11.5 m (Figure 13).During the project, the HeritageCare method and its related tools were successfully tested across a considerable number of heritage buildings in Southwestern Europe.

        <p>Its current appearance dates back to 1749 as a result of the restoration works carried out by Manuel de Lara Churriguera (Figure 14). The inner space of the library is covered with a vaulted system This paper can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103304 20 characterized by ten lunettes, four half pointed arches and polygonal vaults at the extremes, hiding the ceramic tiled roof above supported by timber trusses.

        <p>The Library was first inspected by an equipped team of HeritageCare professionals who applied the StandardCare protocol foreseen for SL1. This protocol allows a rapid condition screening of the conservation status and uses a 4-colour grading scale to associate a degree of severity to each observed damage [4]. This modus operandi permits to rank the overall building condition based on the average grade scored by each inspected building item, thus assisting in the definition of priorities of intervention or, alternatively, additional inspection and diagnosis works (Figure 10a and Figure 15) [4].

        <p>With respect to the case study analysed, one full working day was necessary to perform the onsite inspection of the Library. To guarantee a real-time digitization of the inspection process and speed up reporting times, the inspection team resorted to a tablet equipped with a specific application developed within the HeritageCare project. Based on the SL1 outcome, the state of conservation of the Library was deemed acceptable. However, a detailed technical inspection of the roof covering as well as the control of bioclimate parameters were recommended to prevent possible degradation processes. As a result, a higher inspection level was implemented by applying the PlusCare protocol, thus involving the stages detailed in Section 2.1.With respect to the case study analysed, one full working day was necessary to perform the onsite inspection of the Library.

        <p>To obtain high-resolution information about the geometry and onsite conditions of the Library, a digitalization campaign was carried out to collect panoramic images and capture 3D point clouds.To obtain high-resolution information about the geometry and onsite conditions of the Library, a digitalization campaign was carried out to collect panoramic images and capture 3D point clouds.</p>
        <p>The former were acquired by means of the Canon 700D® DLRS camera. This DLRS camera has a 22.3 x 14.9 mm CMOS sensor with 18 MPx resolution (5196 x 3463 px), a pixel size of 4.29 µm and a crop factor of 1.61. This device was equipped with a Sigma 8 mm circular fisheye lens with a maximum aperture of f/3.5 and a focus engine. Each station required a total of seven shots with 60% of overlap between them. As for the present campaign, 13 equirectangular panoramas were taken (Figure 16): i) 1 to digitalize the main façade; ii) 4 to capture the outdoor space of the inner cloister; iii) 2 for representing the hall of the inner cloister next to the Library; iv) 6 for the digitalization of the Library. The different shots were stitched with the open-source software 
            <rs type="software">Hugin</rs>®. It is noted that each panorama was captured in the same position as the laser scanner station aiming at colouring the TLS point clouds. This was possible thanks to the use of the platform designed by Del Pozo et al. [28] (Figure 16b). Afterwards, the "basic" virtual tour was created in Pano2VR® with the assistance of the plugin HeritageCare4Pano2VR. The 3D digitalization of the Historical Library was performed by means of the light-weight TLS Faro Focus 120®. This laser scanner is based on the phase shift physical principle with a measurement range from 0.6 to 120 m, a capture rate from 122,000 to 976,00 points per second and a nominal accuracy of 2 mm at 25 m in normal conditions of illumination and reflectivity. As a result, 6 scan stations were needed to record the Historical Library. All these scan stations were registered in a common coordinate system using to this end the Iterative Closest Points algorithm [29] by applying the strategy defined by Sánchez Aparicio et al. [30]. The final error after the alignment of the different point clouds was 3 ± 2 mm. The huge amount of captured data, with a total of 140,070,904 points, required an optimization stage that comprised the use of a spatial decimation filter with a threshold of 0.005 m. This allowed to obtain a reduced 3D representation of the Historical Library consisting of 18,209,138 points, namely 13% as compared to the original point cloud (Figure 16). Finally, this point cloud was uploaded to the PlusCare system in .LAZ format in order to be converted by the Potree script for visualization purposes (Figure 16b). The time spent for the complete digitalization process, including data capturing and processing, required two working days by a group of 2 inspectors.

        <p>Basically, three colour grades are used to automatically rate the different variables captured by the monitoring network, being possible to check in real-time whether each parameter falls outside the established tolerance range and could promote material degradation. To define this range, the implementation of proper Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is required. For the present case study, the KPI definition by Corgnati et al. [25] is adopted. Generally, a KPI identifies the percentage of measurements in which the monitored parameter lies within a required range. This way, if the 90% or more of the measurements lies within the pre-established range, the Sensor Status throws a value of 0; if this percentage ranges between 85% and 90% the Sensor Status throws a value of 1; otherwise, for a percentage under 85%, the Sensor Status is set as 2. This concept is extended to all the monitoring network with the exception of the xylophagous detectors, for which only two Sensor Status are defined: i) 0, if the sensor does not detect any xylophagous This paper can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2020.103304 activity, and ii) 2, if the sensor detects the presence of xylophagous activity within the wood.Basically, three colour grades are used to automatically rate the different variables captured by the monitoring network, being possible to check in real-time whether each parameter falls outside the established tolerance range and could promote material degradation.

        <p>First, a visual inspection was carried out with the aid of the HeritageCare damage atlas in order to identify possible deterioration processes, but no remarkable damage was observed. Regarding the environmental assessment, several in-situ measures were taken for the most relevant bioclimate parameters: humidity, temperature and luminosity. The captured values were considered acceptable at the time of the inspection. However, the monitoring data allowed to track some period of the year in which the luminosity values exceeded the recommended ones.First, a visual inspection was carried out with the aid of the HeritageCare damage atlas in order to identify possible deterioration processes, but no remarkable damage was observed.

        <p>To finalize the PlusCare inspection of the Library, a re-compilation of the main results obtained during the experimental campaign was included in the tab Test records. In particular, the information from both the digitalization campaign and the geometrical survey of the library was uploaded to the platform using the standardized PDF template available for download (Figure 18).

        <p>The PlusCare system also features an intuitive environment for non-expert users. The potential of this environment can be measured by the ease in which the multiple and heterogeneous information generated by the expert user is transferred to the non-expert user during the virtual tour, which represents the main output of the PlusCare protocol.The PlusCare system also features an intuitive environment for non-expert users.

        <p>All essential information for the primary conservation needs and ordinary maintenance of the building is condensed into a simple and clear report which can be easily accessed by the end-user while navigating through the virtual tour just by clicking on the heart icon (button f) of the bottom navigation bar of the graphical interface (Figure 9a). Across the document, the information appears in different colours. Building items in good conservation state are highlighted in green, implying that no immediate preventive action is required; those in fair or poor conditions are highlighted in yellow and orange, respectively, where the former colour suggests medium-term preventive actions and the latter short-term measures; finally, building items in bad condition are reported in red, meaning that urgent repair actions are necessary to prevent further decay (Figure 19a). Thanks to this graphical system the owner/manager can perceive at a glance which priority of intervention should be considered if some building items do not appear in good condition. This eye-catching content is then complemented with useful information about the possible consequences for the building.All essential information for the primary conservation needs and ordinary maintenance of the building is condensed into a simple and clear report which can be easily accessed by the end-user while navigating through the virtual tour just by clicking on the heart icon (button f) of the bottom navigation bar of the graphical interface (Figure 9a).

        <p>The 3D icon of the bottom navigation bar of the PlusCare interface gives the user the possibility to access and browse through the tridimensional high-resolution survey of the heritage site.

        <p>The rest of the information stored by the inspectors into the PlusCare database, such as the assets condition, the damages or any additional record (see Section 2.2.1.5), is plotted in the non-expert user environment by means of pre-defined hotspots inserted within the pertinent 360° photos that compose the virtual tours. The full list of hotspots among which the user can navigate is available in the left sidebar, grouped by category (Figure 20a andb). The optimal connection between the database and the virtual tour ensures a quick browsing among the different objects directly from the sidebar menu of the interface, and regardless of the filter applied for the advanced search. In this way, if the user does look for a specific asset and selects its name, the platform automatically places the user's point of view in the area where the selected asset is located (Figure 20b). Furthermore, if the user clicks on that object hotspot, a window pops up allowing to consult both the asset inspection report (Figure 20b) and its location within the 3D model (Figure 20c). The transfer of information associated with damage and test record hotspots is plotted in the same way.

        <p>Like damages, assets and test records, also monitoring data can be consulted directly by the nonexpert user just by clicking on the corresponding hotspots. Each of these hotspots gives access to real-time updates of the parameters measured by the sensors along with their location within the 3D point cloud. The environment uses the Sensor Status variable described in Section 3.4 to plot colour-based warnings of the monitored quantities through a pop-up window: i) green icon, when the variable has a value of 0, thus the monitored parameter is within the acceptable tolerance range; ii) yellow icon, if it has a value of 1, meaning that the monitored parameter is not always within the defined thresholds; and iii) red icon, if the sensor status is 2, which indicates that the value of the considered parameter deviates from the acceptable limits. By means of this visual grading scale the user can get a quick idea about the microclimate conditions existing within his building (Figure 22a). Moreover, thanks to the advanced search options featured by the 
            <rs type="software">PlusCare</rs> system, the user can easily filter the nodes of the monitoring network and get to know immediately which sensors are providing values out of the recommended tolerances. The way to consult this information is substantially improved when using the gyroscope values of the smartphone or tablet (Figure 21b). Information about the monitoring data is also shown on the 3D point cloud of the building (Figure 22b).

        <p>• The exploitation of pyramidal loading schemes for both the 3D point clouds and the 360° images enables to optimize the computational requirements. Additionally, according to the tests carried out to evaluate the time response of the platform, when using an ordinary PC, the average response time of the platform is just 1.8 seconds for loading the main interface; 0.5 seconds for loading the results of the advanced search; and 4.1 seconds for loading the whole 3D point cloud (lower Octree level). Instead, if the platform is loaded in a standard smartphone, the average response time is 4.0 seconds for the main interface; 0.5 seconds for loading the results of the advanced search and an instantaneous response of the gyroscopes when this feature is activated; 8.2 seconds for rendering the whole 3D point cloud with the lower Octree level. These results can be considered more than acceptable to guarantee a good user experience.• The exploitation of pyramidal loading schemes for both the 3D point clouds and the 360° images enables to optimize the computational requirements.

        <p>Metric and morphologic values are equally important, and they can be profitably exploited to cross-check and describe accurately the quantitative information that an HBIM-based model should contain. Moreover, the final output of the PlusCare system is much more user-friendly and accessible by non-expert users. Indeed, PlusCare has been conceived as a preparatory level to TotalCare, the last of the three service levels of the HeritageCare methodology, whose focus is the integration and management of all information collected from previous service levels through an intelligent digital model built in BIM environment. Future works will be focused on integrating new features into the system. On the one hand, it is planned to improve the uploading process of the expert user environment. This will enable to add new information (e.g. assets, damages, monitoring nodes) directly onsite with a mobile device, thereby reducing the back-office work. On the other hand, efforts will be made to achieve a complete integration between the new digitalization approaches, e.g. back-pack mobile mapping systems, and the as-built 360° cameras in order to speed up the data acquisition.Metric and morphologic values are equally important, and they can be profitably exploited to cross-check and describe accurately the quantitative information that an HBIM-based model should contain.
