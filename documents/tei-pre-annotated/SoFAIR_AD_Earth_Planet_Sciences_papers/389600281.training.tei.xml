        <p>Individual differences in the access to deep soil water pools may explain the differential damage among coexisting, conspecific trees as a consequence of drought-induced dieback. We addressed this issue by comparing the responses to a severe drought of three Mediterranean oak species with different drought tolerance: Quercus pubescens and Quercus frainetto, mainly thriving at xeric and mesic sites respectively, and Quercus cerris, which dominates at intermediate sites. For each species we compared coexisting declining (D) and non-declining (ND) trees. The stable isotope composition (δ 2 H, δ 18 O) of xylem and soil water was used to infer a differential use of soil water sources. We also measured tree size and radial growth to quantify the long-term divergence of wood production between D and ND trees, and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in sapwood to evaluate if D trees presented lower NSC values.Individual differences in the access to deep soil water pools may explain the differential damage among coexisting, conspecific trees as a consequence of drought-induced dieback.

        <p>ND trees had access to deeper soil water than D trees except in Q. frainetto, as indicated by significantly more depleted xylem water values. However, a strong δ 2 H offset between soil and xylem water isotopes observed in peak summer could suggest that both tree types were not physiologically active under extreme drought conditions.ND trees had access to deeper soil water than D trees except in Q. frainetto, as indicated by significantly more depleted xylem water values.

        <p>Tree height and recent (last 15-25 years) growth rates in all species studied were lower in D than in ND trees by 22% and 44%, respectively. Lastly, there was not a consistent pattern on NSC sapwood concentration, showing that in Q. pubescens was higher in ND trees, while in Q. frainetto the D trees were the ones exhibiting the higher NSC concentration. We conclude that the vulnerability to drought among conspecific Mediterranean oaks depends on the differential access to deep soil water pools, which may be related to differences in rooting depth, tree size and growth rate.Tree height and recent (last 15-25 years) growth rates in all species studied were lower in D than in ND trees by 22% and 44%, respectively.

        <p>Drought-induced dieback is a global phenomenon affecting all forest biomes (Allen et al. 2015). However, neither all tree species in a community nor all tree individuals in a population are similarly affected by drought. Several studies have evidenced a diverse vulnerability to drought damage among coexisting individuals of different or the same species as a function of site features (dryness, drought intensity) or tree structural (e.g. height), hydraulic (e.g. conduit size, loss of hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic conductance) and functional characteristics (e.g., deciduousness, leaf size and density, sapwood density, root depth, gas exchange rates) (Adams et al. 2017, Greenwood et al. 2017, Martin-StPaul et al. 2017, Choat et al. 2018, Johnson et al. 2018, Olson et al. 2018, Liu et al. 2019). These studies have attempted to link such features to the major mechanisms underlying forest dieback, namely hydraulic failure and carbon starvation (McDowell et al. 2008).Drought-induced dieback is a global phenomenon affecting all forest biomes (Allen et al. 2015).

        <p>Measures of drought damage such as growth decline, leaf shedding, canopy dieback or high mortality rates have been associated to traits as xylem vulnerability to cavitation or low wood density (Nardini et al. 2013). Tree species with dense wood and low specific leaf area tend to show lower post-drought mortality rates than species with the reverse characteristics (Greenwood et al. 2017). Hydraulic traits account for part of the variability in drought vulnerability across tree species, despite their potentially different importance for angiosperms and gymnosperms (Anderegg et al. 2016). For instance, tall gymnosperms are forecasted to be more prone to die due to water shortage than short-stature, hydraulically more efficient angiosperms (McDowell and Allen 2015). A similar reasoning has been applied at the community level in a way that the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/treephys/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/treephys/tpaa026/5775608 by A*STAR c/o NUS Central Library user on 16 March 2020 diversity in species hydraulic traits in temperate and boreal forests explained part of the ecosystem carbon fluxes after a drought (Anderegg et al. 2018). Yet within a particular forest, predicting which tree species and individuals are most likely to die or survive after a severe drought remains a challenge. Individual tree predispositions due to either differential plastic responses or constitutive genetic differences for functional traits related to drought resistance could buffer damage due to drought stress (Voltas et al. 2013).Measures of drought damage such as growth decline, leaf shedding, canopy dieback or high mortality rates have been associated to traits as xylem vulnerability to cavitation or low wood density (Nardini et al. 2013).

        <p>At stand level, variability in traits related to drought resistance is expected to show a wider range between than within species. Therefore, understanding and quantifying the vulnerability to drought within a species is a first step towards predicting the probability of individual survival. Growth trends (tree-ring-width data) have been related to crown dieback and used as early-warning signals to identify and characterize declining and, therefore, more vulnerable individuals within a species (Camarero et al. 2015). However, this approach seems feasible in some species, for instance in some conifers whose susceptible individuals show long periods (&gt;20 yrs.) of growth decline, but not in others as oaks which show shorter periods (5-20 yrs.) of growth reduction (Cailleret et al. 2018). This may be due to the fact that oaks display an anisohydric behavior with pronounced declines in leaf midday water potential during drought and may be prone to xylem cavitation and hydraulic failure, whereas isohydric conifers rapidly close stomata as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) rises (Klein 2014). In the case of ring-porous Mediterranean oak species, hotter droughts may enhance atmospheric evaporative demand shifting VPD towards a critical threshold, surpassing their limit of hydraulic safety (Tognetti et al. 1998, Colangelo et al. 2017a).At stand level, variability in traits related to drought resistance is expected to show a wider range between than within species.

        <p>Consequently, hydraulic failure could be a plausible mechanism of drought-induced dieback in Mediterranean oaks. Drought-tolerance mechanisms are diverse and not restricted to resistance to xylem cavitation, stomatal control of water use or increased carbon storage (Pinheiro et al. 2005). These mechanisms also include different access to soil water pools, with shallow-and deep-rooted species often showing high and low drought damage levels, respectively (Padilla and Puignaire 2007, Hasselquist et al. 2010, Pivovaroff et al. 2016, Antunes et al. 2018, Chitra-Tarak et al. 2018). Drought stress often acts as a major driver of dieback, usually linked to site-specific soil conditions, such as the characteristics of soil parent material that inhibits root development or access to groundwater (Costa et al. 2010). Indeed, large belowground losses of hydraulic conductance and shallow rooting depths are often associated with species that exhibit greater mortality after severe droughts (Johnson et al. 2018). According to stable isotope evidence, roots may take up deep soil water during dry periods which allow trees to buffer drought effects (Ehleringer andDawson1992, Barbeta andPeñuelas, 2017). Coexisting species may show different water isotopic signals corresponding to contrasting -and highly dynamic -water-use strategies during drought as observed in Mediterranean forests (Moreno-Gutierrez et al. 2012, Del Castillo et al. 2016, Dubbert et al. 2019, Dubbert and Werner 2019). However, tree species may tap increasingly deep sources of soil water as drought intensifies (Meinzer et al. 1999, Voltas et al. 2015). The access to deep water reservoirs could buffer the predicted negative impacts of hotter droughts on forests (Sánchez-Salguero et al. 2017) and allow trees to survive and recover in hydrologic refugia where groundwater is available throughout the year (McLaughlin et al. 2017).Consequently, hydraulic failure could be a plausible mechanism of drought-induced dieback in Mediterranean oaks.

        <p>Here we test the idea that tree-to-tree differences in the use of deep soil water may explain the differential damage of coexisting, conspecific oak individuals due to drought-induced dieback. For this purpose, we use information of the stable isotope Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/treephys/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/treephys/tpaa026/5775608 by A*STAR c/o NUS Central Library user on 16 March 2020 composition (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) of soil and xylem water obtained at the peak of summer drought. We also quantify changes in radial growth and in the sapwood concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of conspecific trees showing different vulnerability to drought. We expect that non-declining, asymptomatic trees will be able to extract water from deeper soil water pools than declining, symptomatic trees. We also expect this difference to be magnified in the species occupying the most xeric sites (Q. pubescens), subjected to frequent and intense episodes of water shortage, compared with the species typical of mesic sites (Q. frainetto), which grows more, depends on shallower soil water and has a lower root-to-shoot ratio (Ledo et al. 2018). Lastly, we hypothesize that declining trees will show a lower sapwood NSC concentration than non-declining trees.Here we test the idea that tree-to-tree differences in the use of deep soil water may explain the differential damage of coexisting, conspecific oak individuals due to drought-induced dieback.

        <p>We studied three Mediterranean, deciduous, ring-porous oak species in southern Italy: two species (Quercus pubescens L., Quercus cerris L.) were sampled in different stands located at the Gorgoglione municipality (40° 21' 51'' N, 16° 10' 34''E, 825 m a.s.l.), and the third species (Quercus frainetto Ten.) was sampled in a stand near San Paolo Albanese (40° 01' 20'' N, 16° 20' 46'' E, 950 m a.s.l.). Q. pubescens is widely distributed across southern Europe, Q. cerris is found in the Italian and Balkan Peninsulas, Asia Minor, central Europe and France, and Q. frainetto is found across the Western Mediterranean Basin (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2016). These species often coexist (and hybridize) in sites with mean annual temperature (MAT) of 6-18 ºC and annual precipitation (MAP) of 500-1300 mm. In the study areas climate is Mediterranean, characterised by dry and warm summers that have become particularly noticeable during the last decade (Fig. 1). At San Paolo Albanese, total June to August precipitation is 79 mm and winters are wet and mild. At this site, MAT is 16.4 °C andMAP is 742 mm (data from Oriolo station, 40° 03'11''N, 16° 26' 47'' E, 445 m a.s.l., 1950-2016 period). At Gorgoglione, total June to August precipitation is 93 mm and winters are wet and mild.

        <p>To assess long-term climate trends we used the E-OBS 0.25º-gridded climate dataset considering the 1950-2017 period (Cornes et al. 2018). We downloaded annual and monthly temperature and precipitation data for the grid with coordinates 16.00-16.25º W and 40.00-40.25º N using the climate explorer webpage (https://climexp.knmi.nl).To assess long-term climate trends we used the E-OBS 0.25º-gridded climate dataset considering the 1950-2017 period (Cornes et al. 2018).

        <p>We also estimated drought severity using the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (hereafter PDSI) based on the gridded monthly precipitation and temperature data (Wells et al. 2004). We calculated the summer PDSI (from June to August) to quantify summer drought severity. Soils are sandy-loam textured with a mean pH of 7.5 and mostly shallow (i.e. ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 m depth). They rest on a soft sedimentary fractured bedrock consisting of an alternation of sandstones, pelites and conglomerates layers (Gorgoglione Flysch Formation), which typify part of the Apennines chain.We also estimated drought severity using the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (hereafter PDSI) based on the gridded monthly precipitation and temperature data (Wells et al. 2004).

        <p>In the study area, the three species coexist but Q. pubescens preferentially occupies the most xeric sites (e.g., steep slopes with southern aspect and shallow soils), Q. frainetto is found in mesic sites (e.g., gentle slopes with northern aspect and relatively deep soils), and Q. cerris abounds in intermediate locations (Gentilesca et al. 2017). In San Paolo Albanese, the vegetation is formed by a pure high forest of Q. frainetto for a density of 348 trees ha -1 , whilst in Gorgoglione the stand is a mixed high forest with a mean density of 600 trees ha -1 dominated by Quercus cerris L. (71%), followed by Quercus pubescens L. (25%) and other broadleaf species (4%). These oak forests were formerly managed as coppices with livestock grazing.In the study area, the three species coexist but Q. pubescens preferentially occupies the most xeric sites (e.g., steep slopes with southern aspect and shallow soils), Q. frainetto is found in mesic sites (e.g., gentle slopes with northern aspect and relatively deep soils), and Q. cerris abounds in intermediate locations (Gentilesca et al. 2017).

        <p>All species have shown symptoms corresponding to drought-induced dieback since the turn of this century, specifically canopy dieback, leaf loss and withering, growth decline, and high mortality (Colangelo et al. 2017a(Colangelo et al. , 2017b)). In the most affected stands, more than 50% of mature specimens showed dieback symptoms and 15% recently died (Colangelo et al. 2018).All species have shown symptoms corresponding to drought-induced dieback since the turn of this century, specifically canopy dieback, leaf loss and withering, growth decline, and high mortality (Colangelo et al. 2017a(Colangelo et al. , 2017b)).

        <p>To characterize stand structure (density, basal area) and assess the degree of dieback damage we followed a similar procedure as in Colangelo et al. (2017a). Seven circular plots (radius of 15 m) were randomly located in each site and in areas where each species was dominant. Within each plot, dieback of all mature oak trees was characterized by a visual assessment of crown transparency made by two independent observations of the same tree (Camarero et al. 2016). Declining oaks (hereafter D trees) were considered those with crown transparency higher than 50%, whereas nondeclining oaks (hereafter ND trees) were considered those with transparency lower than 50%. The size (diameter at 1.3 m, total height) of all trees was measured.To characterize stand structure (density, basal area) and assess the degree of dieback damage we followed a similar procedure as in Colangelo et al.

        <p>For each species, we selected 12-21 paired trees of different vigour, i.e. neighbouring ND and D oaks located 10-15 m apart at maximum.

        <p>The transversal surface of cores was cut using a sledge microtome to differentiate the annual tree rings (Gärtner and Nievergelt 2010). Rings were visually cross-dated and measured with precision of 0.01 mm using a binocular microscope coupled to a computer with the

        <p>The 
            <rs type="software">COFECHA</rs> program (Holmes 1983) was used to evaluate the visual cross-dating of tree-ring width data. To quantify growth trends and to partially avoid the age-/ sizerelated decrease in tree-ring width, we transformed these data into annual basal area increment (BAI) assuming a circular shape of stems. Tree age at 1.3 m was estimated from increment cores that either included the pith or were close to it (the arc of the innermost rings was visible). In the second case, we followed Duncan (1989) and fitted a template of concentric circles to the curve of the innermost rings to estimate the number of missing rings.

        <p>The soil and stem xylem sampling took place in August 2017 during an exceptionally hot and dry period, with a monthly temperature over 2 ºC higher and precipitation about 40 mm lower than long-term averages for the region (22.8 C and 56 mm). This resulted in the most severe drought occurring over the last 70 years (Fig. 1). Information on the use of soil water sources for each species and tree type (D, ND) was obtained using measurements of water isotope ratios (oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition, δ 18 O and δ 2 H) for different soil depths as well as for xylem water (Martín-Gómez et al. 2015, Grossiord et al. 2017). Xylem samples were obtained from 11:00 to 13:00 h solar time from twelve D and twelve ND trees per species at Gorgoglione (August 23 rd ) and San Paolo Albanese (August 24 th ). Two branches were sampled from the upper third crown of each tree at north-and south-facing sides using telescopic loppers. Sampled branches were ca. 1.5-3.0 cm thick and shoot segments (5-7 cm long) were cut and then bark-peeled, placed immediately into glass vials and frozen in dry ice to avoid evaporation. Soil samples were collected for the same days at two depths (0-15 cm and 15-40 cm, that is, until reaching the bedrock) using a straight tube probe carefully cleaned between consecutive samplings. From 07:00 to 09:00 h solar time, samples were taken from soil pits located at intermediate positions between pairs of sampled D and ND individuals for each species. The soil extracted was placed rapidly into glass vials and frozen in dry ice. All samples were kept frozen until processing and analysis.The soil and stem xylem sampling took place in August 2017 during an exceptionally hot and dry period, with a monthly temperature over 2 ºC higher and precipitation about 40 mm lower than long-term averages for the region (22.8 C and 56 mm). This resulted in the most severe drought occurring over the last 70 years (Fig. 1). Information on the use of soil water sources for each species and tree type (D, ND) was obtained using measurements of water isotope ratios (oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition, δ 18 O and δ 2 H) for different soil depths as well as for xylem water (Martín-Gómez et al. 2015, Grossiord et al. 2017).

        <p>Xylem and soil water was extracted by cryogenic vacuum distillation (Martín-Gómez et al. 2015). Sample tubes were placed in a heated silicone oil bath (110-120°C), and connected with Ultra-Torr unions (Swagelok Co., Solon, OH, USA) to a vacuum system for a constant vacuum pressure of ca. 10 -2 mbar, including U-shaped water traps in series that were refrigerated with liquid N 2 . The extraction time was 90 min for xylem and 120 min for soil samples. Using exactly the same extraction device, this extraction time has been previously shown to be enough to extract all available water from similar soil and xylem samples (i.e., involving sub-mediterranean oaks) to those of our study (Martín-Gómez et al. 2017). Captured water was then transferred into cap-crimp 2-ml vials, and stored at 4°C until analysis. Gravimetric soil water content (GWC) was assessed for each sample using the sample weight before and after water extraction.

        <p>The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition ( 18 O and  2 H, respectively) of water was determined by isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy (IRIS) using a Picarro L2120-i coupled to an A0211 high-precision vaporizer (Picarro Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The estimated precision, based on the repeated analysis of four reference water samples, was 0.10‰for  18 O and 0.40‰ for  2 H. Residual organic contaminants in the distilled water can hamper the interpretation of plant and soil water isotopic composition conducted with IRIS (Martín-Gómez et al., 2015).

        <p>The local meteoric water line (LMWL) was obtained from rainfall isotope data collected in the Mt. Vulture volcano (40º 57' N, 15º 38' E), southern Italy, for the period 2002-2004(Paternoster et al. 2008)). LMWL was described as  2 H = 3.72 + 6.44× 18 O (R 2 =0.99). For groundwater, two alternative estimates were used: the weighted average of monthly isotopic signatures of precipitation from October to April (considered as the soil recharge period in the Mediterranean) at Mt. Vulture (within a 80-km radius from the experimental sites) over the same period using an available dataset built about 15 year ago (method 1), and the average of samples of water collected from seven (Gorgoglione) or five (San Paolo Albanese) nearby fountains or wells located within a 5-km radius of the sampled stands (method 2). These water samples were obtained at the end of June 2019. The results were as follows: -9.6 ± 0.94‰ (mean ± standard deviation) and -58.8 ± 9.17‰ (method 1), -7.7 ± 0.23‰ and -47.5 ± 1.21‰ (method 2, Gorgoglione), and -8.5 ± 0.17‰ and -51.8 ± 0.84‰ (method 2, San Paolo Albanese) for  18 O and  2 H, respectively.

        <p>Evaporative enrichment of xylem water, which has a disproportionately greater effect on  18 O than on  2 H (Craig, 1961), was quantified through the concept of the soil water line-conditioned excess (SW-excess), as proposed by Barbeta et al. (2019). The SW-excess describes the potential offset of xylem water samples relative to their soil water line, and represents a modification of the line-conditioned excess (Landwehr and Coplen 2006), which in turn describes an offset of water samples relative to the LMWL.Evaporative enrichment of xylem water, which has a disproportionately greater effect on  18 O than on  2 H (Craig, 1961), was quantified through the concept of the soil water line-conditioned excess (SW-excess), as proposed by Barbeta et al.

        <p>To assess the carbon status of coexisting ND and D trees we quantified sapwood NSC concentrations. We selected five trees per vigour class and sampled their sapwood at 1.3 m using Pressler increment borers (see Colangelo et al. 2017a). The sapwood was visually distinguished in the field and separated using a razor blade. Sapwood samples were collected in summer 2018, transported in a portable cooler to the laboratory, and stored at -20 °C until freeze-dried. Then, they were weighed and milled to a homogeneous powder in a ball mill (Retsch Mixer MM301, Leeds, UK). Soluble sugars were extracted with 80% (v/v) ethanol and their concentration was colorimetrically determined using the phenol-sulfuric method (Buysse and Merckx 1993). Starch and complex sugars remaining after ethanol extraction were enzymatically digested as described in Colangelo et al. (2017a). NSCs measured after ethanol extractions are referred to as soluble sugars (SS), and NSCs after enzymatic digestion are referred to as starch.

        <p>Mediterranean oaks can keep their physiological activity during summer by relying on water reservoirs like groundwater or deep soil layers (Del Castillo et al. 2016, Martín-Gómez et al. 2017). A strong dependence of deciduous oaks on rainfall recharge during autumn and winter has been observed in the western Mediterranean basin through the analysis of stable oxygen isotopes in wood cellulose (Shestakova et al. 2014). In this regard, the differences between declining and non-declining trees were only evident for the more xeric species, which reinforces the importance of the reliance on deep soil water pools of oaks for survival under progressively hotter droughts. However, we observed a clear isotopic offset between soil and xylem water isotopes in peak summer regardless of the species. For this reason, we could not quantify the relative contribution of different soil depths as water sources for declining and nondeclining trees using a mixing model (e.g. Voltas et al. 2015).Mediterranean oaks can keep their physiological activity during summer by relying on water reservoirs like groundwater or deep soil layers (Del Castillo et al. 2016, Martín-Gómez et al. 2017).

        <p>In fact, the xylem samples were placed along an alternative evaporation line of soil water that may correspond to previous months of the growing season, as previously reported for Q. ilex subjected to an acute drought (Del Castillo et al. 2016). This might indicate that both tree types were not actively taking up water in peak summer, therefore ceasing their physiological activity (i.e. transpiration) during the extreme summer drought of 2017. This is feasible taking into account that there was 0 mm of precipitation in July and August 2017, and the precipitation for the first half of the year was only 61% of a normal year. The low soil GWC also points in this direction. The analysis of seasonal dynamics of root access to different water pools would provide additional clues on the physiological performance of healthy and declining oak trees, as demonstrated for understanding differences among functional types in drought-prone environments (Barbeta et al. 2015;Martín-Gómez et al. 2017;Antunes et al. 2018).In fact, the xylem samples were placed along an alternative evaporation line of soil water that may correspond to previous months of the growing season, as previously reported for Q. ilex subjected to an acute drought (Del Castillo et al. 2016). This might indicate that both tree types were not actively taking up water in peak summer, therefore ceasing their physiological activity (i.e. transpiration) during the extreme summer drought of 2017.

        <p>The isotopic offset between xylem and soil water samples, however, does not necessarily indicates an older age of water kept by the trees in peak summer. Indeed, there is a growing body of literature reporting on deuterium fractionation in controlled experiments (Vargas et al. 2017) process becoming progressively more important as soil dries out (Vargas et al. 2017, Barbeta et al. 2019). This challenges the general assumption of lack of fractionation during root water uptake (Lin and Sternberg 1993). Also, spatial heterogeneity in the stable isotopic composition of soil water with different mobility may also impact on xylem isotopic signatures (Orlowski et al. 2018, Dubbert et al. 2019, Oerter and Bowen 2019), thereby complicating tree water source identification. Deuterium fractionation has also been reported between xylem sap and root or stem tissue water in drylands (Zhao et al. 2016), and water cycling, storage and exchange is known to be more common than previously assumed in plants, which together could change xylem isotopic composition. We can neither discard the influence of cavitation processes for anisohydric species, such as oaks, on the explanation of the offset in xylem isotopic composition. In fact, xylem water sampling took place at noon solar time during peak summer, which may have increased the risk of cavitation and hydraulic failure in the sampled trees, thereby mediating the water exchange between phloem and xylem due to embolism repair and, hence, the observed xylem offset (Nardini et al. 2011, Pfautsch et al. 2015). The rock permeability of the area, which can create differences in exchangeable water held in weathered bedrock, has been also postulated as an alternative source of water for plants that might explain isotopic offsets (Palacio et al. 2014, Oshun et al. 2015, Barbeta &amp; Peñuelas 2017, Rempe &amp; Dietrich 2018).The isotopic offset between xylem and soil water samples, however, does not necessarily indicates an older age of water kept by the trees in peak summer.

        <p>A role of mycorrhizal fungi on the preferential uptake of the light hydrogen isotope by plants has been also proposed (Poca et al. 2019), again questioning the fractionation-free assumption during root water uptake. Since free-living fungi and mycorrhizal species are negatively affected by drought (Castaño et al. 2018), the extent of root discrimination against the heavier 2 H is expected to be relatively more important under optimal soil water conditions. In fact, the stand most affected by drought (Q. pubescens) showed a significantly higher (i.e., less negative) SW-excess, which suggests potential effects of soil fungi on tree water uptake being more important in less water-limited sites (Rempe and Dietrich 2018). Regardless of the relative magnitude of deuterium fractionation processes, the closer values of xylem water to groundwater in non-declining trees of Q. cerris and Q. pubescens point to a preferential access to deep water reservoirs for healthy individuals of these species.A role of mycorrhizal fungi on the preferential uptake of the light hydrogen isotope by plants has been also proposed (Poca et al. 2019), again questioning the fractionation-free assumption during root water uptake.

        <p>Only declining trees of Q. pubescens, the species dominant under the most xeric conditions of our study and which better tolerates drought (Tognetti et al. 1998), presented a lower NSC concentration than non-declining trees.

In this species, declining trees, which also showed lower recent growth rates than non-declining trees, may be storing carbon not used for producing stem wood as sapwood NSCs, in agreement with previous theoretical (Tardieu et al. 2011, Körner 2013) and empirical evidences (Muller et al. 2011). These studies emphasize that carbon sinks (e.g., cambium and leaf growth) are much more sensitive to water deficit (i.e., their activity is restricted earlier or at lower levels of drought stress) than carbon sources (e.g., photosynthesis rate).frainetto, declining trees showed a significantly higher total NSC concentration than non-declining individuals (Colangelo et al. 2017a).

        <p>Furthermore, the higher concentrations of soluble sugars in declining trees of Q. cerris and Q. frainetto could be due to their role as osmolytes or to impaired phloem functioning which prevents access to carbohydrate reserves (Sala et al. 2012).Furthermore, the higher concentrations of soluble sugars in declining trees of Q. cerris and Q. frainetto could be due to their role as osmolytes or to impaired phloem functioning which prevents access to carbohydrate reserves (Sala et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>However, these measured differences in NSC pools between declining and nondeclining trees in Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto may have been also affected by different water availability in summer across years. Indeed the tree-ring width data show that the differences between declining and non-declining trees arose much before the sampling date, especially in Q. pubescens. Of course, these prior (chronic) differences in growth may be due to several reasons (i.e. previous dieback episodes, disturbances, selective dead of trees with lowest growth rates, etc.), and may have differently predisposed trees to the 2010s droughts. However, non-declining and declining trees showed similar growth rates during dry periods (Fig. 2), whereas nondeclining trees grew more than declining trees during wet years, except for Q. frainetto where declining trees displayed a higher BAI than non-declining trees around 1960s.However, these measured differences in NSC pools between declining and nondeclining trees in Q. pubescens and Q. frainetto may have been also affected by different water availability in summer across years.

        <p>These shifting responses indicate a reduced responsiveness to water shortage during that cool period which could explain the higher growth rate of declining trees. However, we cannot discard other potential drivers explaining the differences in growth rates including management, pests, fire or other climatic events (e.g., frosts, etc.). Such different growth responsiveness to drought and temperature variation can predispose trees to show decline in response to recent droughts and reconcile observations made at decadal to annual scales.These shifting responses indicate a reduced responsiveness to water shortage during that cool period which could explain the higher growth rate of declining trees.

        <p>As previously observed (Colangelo et al. 2017b), declining trees were shorter than non-declining trees, regardless of species. This difference cannot be fully explained by changes in tree-to-tree competition intensity. Recently, declining trees also showed lower radial growth rates, thus reducing their sapwood cross-sectional area which would disproportionally affect their leaf and root production (Magnani et al. 2000). This could have magnified the disparity in scaling strategies between declining and non-declining trees leading to an irreversible drought-induced reduction in radial growth, hydraulic conductivity and carbon uptake. How successive and hotter droughts contribute to sharp growth reductions and increased differences in vulnerability within a tree species is still unclear.As previously observed (Colangelo et al. 2017b), declining trees were shorter than non-declining trees, regardless of species.

        <p>Tree-to-tree size variability could be connected to the observed differences in access to deep water pools since shorter declining trees could form shallower or less efficient root systems, thus relying more on superficial soil water than taller, deeprooted, non-declining trees. Such allometric or scaling relationships (cf. Ledo et al. 2018) are understudied in the case of drought-induced dieback, and demand further research to assess how allocation patterns (i.e., root to shoot ratio) drive access to soil water and if these relationships are related to drought damage at the intra-specific level.Tree-to-tree size variability could be connected to the observed differences in access to deep water pools since shorter declining trees could form shallower or less efficient root systems, thus relying more on superficial soil water than taller, deeprooted, non-declining trees.

        <p>Similar approaches have been carried out for interspecific comparisons (Olson et al. 2018). For example, large trees might form more extensive and deeper root systems or have a higher hydraulic capacitance (Bucci et al. 2005), and thus show a better capacity to tolerate drought stress. The assignment of such differences to adaptive variation in the responses to drought should also consider confounding factors as microsite differences (e.g., topography-mediated hydrologic refugia) or climate-driven changes in root to shoot ratios (e.g., Camarero et al. 2016Camarero et al. , 2018)).Similar approaches have been carried out for interspecific comparisons (Olson et al. 2018).

        <p>The idea that declining trees may be less able to access to deep water pools than non-declining trees is supported by empirical studies. In an experimental setting where dry and warm conditions were induced, drought led to deeper water uptake in stressed trees relative to ambient, unstressed trees (Grossiord et al. 2017). Such shift in water uptake depth can be linked to a higher carbon allocation to deep roots under conditions of soil water depletion or elevated VPD during the dry summer (Bréda et al. 2006). This seasonal shift can disappear when precipitation increases and water sources from shallower soil layers become fully available (Voltas et al. 2015). In addition, the ability of roots to uptake increasing amounts of groundwater with extended and hotter droughts is limited (Markewitz et al. 2010, Barbeta et al. 2015), and high soil temperature may restrain root activity and water and nutrients uptake in species with shallow roots or amplify soil hydrophobicity (Williams and Ehleringer 2000). Local factors like the differential access to deep water sources should be included in models to produce more realistic forecasts of forest dieback. Soil factors could explain why drought triggers dieback in sites where that was not an a priori expectation (Gazol et al. 2018).The idea that declining trees may be less able to access to deep water pools than non-declining trees is supported by empirical studies.
