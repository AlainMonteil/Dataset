        <p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), produced via incomplete combustion of organics, convey signatures of vegetation burned in the geologic past. New and published burn experiments reveal how the quantity, distributions, and isotopic abundances of fire-derived PAHs were influenced by fuel types, burn conditions, and also phase. PAH concentrations were higher in burn residues from moderate burn temperatures (400-500 ºC), and significantly lower in residues from cooler (&lt;300ºC) or hotter (&gt;600ºC) conditions, especially when oxygen was limited. PAH forms tended to be smaller in smoke samples and larger in residues, consistent with molecular physical and chemical properties. Plant functional types were distinguished by relative amounts of retene and dimethyl phenanthrene isomers. Isotopically distinct photosynthetic pathways of the burned material were reflected in the δ 13 C values of PAHs, which faithfully captured biomass signatures as well as the ~12‰ offset between C3 and C4 plant types. PAH size, alkylation, and isotope characteristics can differentiate combusted plant types and distinguish between air-borne and sedimentary transport mechanisms. New proxy approaches using PAH amounts, distributions, and isotope signatures can aid and refine interpretations of paleofire ecology in the geologic record.</p>
        <p>Human activities are changing wildfire patterns both regionally and globally (Bowman et al., 2009;Archibald et al., 2017). Earth history offers many potential insights into how wildfire dynamics responded to large climate perturbations in the past and their consequences for the carbon cycle (Daniau et al., 2012;Denis et al., 2017). Rising global temperatures and pCO2 are fast approaching levels not experienced in the last 30 Myr (Burke et al., 2018). As a result, reconstructions of paleo-fire regimes during the Holocene, Pliocene, and Eocene will continue to grow in importance for predicting future changes in wildfires (Daniau and Brücher, 2016;Burke et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>The main variables of interest when reconstructing paleofire are changes in fire occurrence, intensity, area and vegetation community burned. Common proxies for reconstructing ancient fire include abundances of microscopic and macroscopic charcoal and bulk black carbon (Conedera et al., 2009;Thevenon et al., 2010). The reflectance, size, shape, and isotopic composition of charcoal preserve information about fuel source, burn severity, and burn area (Umbanhowar and McGrath, 1998;Duffin et al., 2008;Leys et al., 2017). However, charcoal production and preservation tends to bias towards woody fuels, high temperature burns, and fires proximal to sedimentary records (Umbanhowar and McGrath, 1998;Conedera et al., 2009;Hudspith and Belcher, 2017;Doerr et al., 2018). Molecular proxies for fire complement these bulk parameters, as they have different biases, preservation potential and transport pathways, and preserve additional information in their chemical structures, distributions, and isotopic compositions (Denis et al., 2012;Schneider et al., 2013;Kirchgeorg et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can result from incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels (Richter and Howard, 2000;Marynowski and Simoneit, 2009) and are increasingly used as a proxy for vegetation burning in sedimentary records (Denis et al., 2017;Miller et al., 2017;Argiriadis et al., 2018;Callegaro et al., 2018;Karp et al., 2018;Vachula et al., 2019). Changes in PAH concentrations in geologic archives are commonly interpreted to reflect changes in fire occurrence via a combination of changes in fire frequency and intensity (Denis et al., 2012). Biomass burned, high temperatures and low O2 content have all been linked to higher quantities of PAHs generated during biomass combustion (McGrath et al., 2003;Lu et al., 2009;Kappenberg et al., 2019). Additionally, many paleofire studies interpret changes in PAH size distribution as changes in fire intensity based mainly on the observation that aromaticity in bulk burn products increases with temperature (McGrath et al., 2003;McBeath et al., 2011;Denis et al., 2012). However, many of these interpretations are based on observations from a limited set of burn conditions, and there are strong indications that PAHs behave differently than other pyrogenic parameters in both experimental and environmental settings (Wiedemeier et al., 2015b;Wiedemeier et al., 2015a;Hanke et al., 2016;Santín et al., 2017). Comparisons of PAHs produced under a wide variety of observational and experimental conditions will constrain the relative influence of temperature, O2 content, burn phase partitioning and fuel source to strengthen interpretations of PAH characteristics.</p>
        <p>The fate of PAHs in the environment are linked to their physiochemical properties. PAH molecular size and shape determine their aqueous solubility (Cw sat ), affinity for organics (Kow) and volatility (Vp) ( Miller et al., 1985;Mackay, 1998;Lima et al., 2005). Smaller compounds have higher vapor pressures and are preferentially emitted with the gaseous phase during biomass combustion (Mackay, 1998;Lima et al., 2005). Larger compounds have lower aqueous solubility and tend to partition more strongly into organic coatings and particles (Mackay, 1998;Lima et al., 2005). In addition, low aqueous solubility hinders biodegradation of PAHs with four or more rings (Mackay, 1998;Lima et al., 2005). Differential partitioning of PAHs between burn phases may impact their preservation, transport, and ultimate fate in soils and sediments. While many studies have examined PAH partitioning between vapor and particulate burn phases in a plume (e.g., Jenkins et al., 1996;Lima et al., 2005;Shen et al., 2011), few have compared PAH distributions between char residues and smoke aerosol burn phases (Kappenberg et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Modern environmental studies of PAH characteristics tend to focus on differentiating anthropogenic pollutant sources (i.e., residential wood combustion, fossil fuel combustion, and petroleum; (Yunker et al., 2002;Lima et al., 2005;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015). Parent PAHs (structures without any alkyl-substitutions) are preferentially produced under fast, hightemperature combustion conditions, while structures with one or more alkyl-substitutions are preferentially produced under slow, low-temperature thermogenic reactions (Blumer and Youngblood, 1975;Budzinski et al., 1995). Thus, the relative amounts of alkylated PAHs provide fingerprints of fire-derived vs. fossil fuel derived sources (Yunker et al., 2002;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015;Denis, 2016;Rocha and Palma, 2019). However, there are still uncertainties in how these distributions vary within a set of pyrogenic samples (e.g., Keiluweit et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Wildfire-derived PAHs may preserve additional information about the type of plant community that burned. Previous work has suggested certain alkylated PAH structures and carbon isotopes of PAHs can distinguish between different plant types (Grice et al., 2009;Nabbefeld et al., 2010;Holman and Grice, 2018). Several parameters, such as dimethyl phenanthrene (DMP) ratios, are used as proxies for changes in burned plant community (Yunker et al., 2002;Kappenberg et al., 2019). However, plant-specific PAH distributions and carbon isotopes have been measured far less often than other plant biomarkers (i.e., leaf waxes, terpenoids; Diefendorf and Freimuth, 2017;Nakamura, 2019). The lack of PAH measurements on modern burned plants make it challenging to use these tools to quantitatively reconstruct changes in burned plant communities.</p>
        <p>The aim of this study was to improve the use of PAHs in studies of paleofire based on a better understanding of their quantities, distributions, and isotope signatures from controlled burn experiments. We evaluated different fuel, burn conditions and phase to learn which of these factors: 1) might bias PAH quantity as a proxy for fire occurrence 2) can be distinguished by characteristic PAH distributions, and 3) potentially limit the fidelity of carbon isotope signatures for fuels representing different plant groups.</p>
        <p>We examined relationships between burn conditions and the concentrations, distributions, and carbon isotope values of PAHs from 10 burn experiments on seven different plant taxa. PAH data generated from these experiments were combined with data from six published studies that burned an additional twenty-five taxa. This work presents statistical analyses of a suite of 13 PAHs (Fig. 1) from 32 plant taxa, representing a total of 56 samples generated under different experimental conditions (Table 1; Table EA1). We examined molecular ratio parameters derived from the literature and based on statistical patterns that emerged from the dataset (Table 2).</p>
        <p>Experimental conditions and vegetation samples for burn experiments were described by Vitzthum von Eckstaedt et al. (2012). Briefly, dead, dry plant material (a mix of leaves, duff, branches, twigs, and bark) was combusted inside a ventilated tent with an air blower to maintain sufficient ambient O2 (Vitzthum von Eckstaedt et al. 2012). Ten experiments were conducted with seven different Australian taxa, including two C4 grasses (Spinifex spp. and Themeda triandra), one C3 grass (Triticum spp.), two eucalypts (Corymbia calophylla and Eucalyptus diversicolor), and two gymnosperms (Ginkgo biloba, and Cycas spp). The two C4 grasses each were burned twice at slightly different temperatures, while the rest of the plants were each burned once.</p>
        <p>Temperatures were monitored throughout each experiment as per Vitzthum von Eckstaedt et al.</p>
        <p>(2012) and maximum recorded temperatures were assigned to each sample. Burn residues were collected and stored in a cool, dry location in glass jars.</p>
        <p>Organics were extracted from burn residues via Soxhlet extraction (72 hrs) with a 9:1 azeotrope of dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol (MeOH). Approximately 2-10 mg of the extracted bitumen was separated into aliphatic, aromatic, and polar fractions by small-scale silica gel liquid chromatography (Maslen et al., 2011). PAHs were identified and quantified using an Agilent 7890B Gas Chromatograph coupled to a 5977B Mass-Selective detector (GC-MS). The aromatic fraction was injected via split-splitless injector (280 °C) operating in splitless mode onto a DB-5ms 60-m column (0.25-mm internal diameter, 0.25-µm film thickness). The oven was held at 60 °C for 2 min, ramped at 4 °C/min to 310 °C and then held for 35 minutes. Samples were run in selective ion monitoring (SIM)/scan mode, which alternates between SIM and full scan modes during a single run (SIM method details in Table A1). Compounds were identified in SIM and full scan mode via mass spectra and retention time comparison to authentic standards. PAHs were quantified using selected ions (Table A1) and response factors determined using a 5-pt calibration curve from the same standard PAH suite.</p>
        <p>Compound-specific carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) measurements were made with a Thermo Scientific Trace GC Ultra, connected to a Thermo Scientific Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer (irMS) via a GC Isolink and Conflo IV. The aromatic fraction was injected into a split-splitless injector operating in splitless mode, held at 280 °C. The same GC conditions used above for GC-MS analyses were used for CSIA. Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.5 mL/min. GC column outflow passed through the GC Isolink combustion reactor (copper oxide and nickel oxide, held at 1000 °C). When concentrations allowed, samples were run in triplicate, and sample standard deviations were generally &lt;0.3‰ (1σ). The δ 13 C values were expressed in parts permil (‰) relative to the International Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard. Every 2-5 sample measurements, a mixture of standards with known δ 13 C values (an in-house mixture of n-alkanes from C11 to C25, calibrated to the VPDB scale using isotopic reference materials purchased from Arndt Schimmelmann, Indiana University) was analyzed in order to ensure instrument accuracy (0.2‰, 1σ, n=42) and precision (0.2‰, 1σ, n=42). Bulk organic carbon isotope measurements on burned and unburned plant material were made with a Thermo Delta V IRMS coupled to a Thermo Elemental Analyzer Flash 1112 via Conflo IV at the Western Australia Biogeochemistry Centre. Samples were run in duplicate and standard deviations were &lt;0.1‰ (1σ).</p>
        <p>Concentrations of 13 PAHs (Fig. 1) generated from burned biomass were compiled from published studies (6 reports;25 taxa;46 samples;Oros and Simoneit, 2001a;Oros and Simoneit, 2001b;Oros et al., 2006;Wiesenberg et al., 2009;Keiluweit et al., 2012;Santín et al., 2017) and combined with new data (this report; 7 taxa; 10 samples) as described above (Table 1).</p>
        <p>Additionally, of these studies, 4 reported concentrations of alkylated phenanthrenes, and these were compiled with new data to form a subset of 36 samples to examine alkylated distributions (Table 1). In the last 30 years, there have been many studies measuring PAHs generated from biomass burned under various conditions, and only those samples with the following properties were included in the compilation: 1) Concentrations of all 13 PAH compounds were measured via GC-MS and reported separately for each compound.</p>
        <p>2) Samples were derived from a single plant (i.e., not a community or cellulose), using whole biomass (i.e., not a selected tissue like wood), and the taxon was identified 3) Highest heating temperature (HTT) was reported (measured or estimated) 4) Studies that simulated wood stove burning, rather than vegetation burning, were excluded because these studies used economic wood, which is not representative of wildfires Several studies did not meet one or more of these criteria and thus their results were not included in our analysis (i.e., O' Malley and Burke, 1997;Iinuma et al., 2007;Lu et al., 2009;Wang et al., 2009;Guillon et al., 2013;Wiedemeier et al., 2015b). Even so, our compiled dataset covers a wide variety of plant types (32 taxa) and burn conditions, and allows for statistical analyses to examine potential controls on pyrogenic PAH distributions.</p>
        <p>Carbon isotope values of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene were compiled from two published studies (n=30; O' Malley and Burke, 1997;Guillon et al., 2013), as these compounds tend to dominate parent PAH distributions from biomass combustion(Table 1; Simoneit, 2002). Previous reports found temperature did not exert a significant influence on δ 13 C values of PAHs (O'Malley et al., 1994;O' Malley and Burke, 1997). As a result, we focused on the influence of plant functional type on δ 13 C values of PAHs.</p>
        <p>Authors used different experimental approaches to create burn conditions and capture products. Five studies set fire to vegetation under open atmospheric conditions meant to simulate natural fires (Oros andSimoneit, 2001b, 2001a;Oros et al., 2006;Santín et al., 2017;this study).</p>
        <p>Three studies charred samples using a muffle furnace (Wiesenberg et al., 2009;Keiluweit et al., 2012;Santín et al., 2017). Studies that provided isotope data employed either a fireplace (Guillon et al., 2013) or a combustion furnace (O' Malley and Burke, 1997). O2 conditions were designated based on reports of experimental setup. Studies that burned under open atmosphere or ventilation were designated "atmospheric" (This study; O' Malley and Burke, 1997;Oros and Simoneit, 2001a;Oros and Simoneit, 2001b;Oros et al., 2006;Guillon et al., 2013;Santín et al., 2017) and studies which noted that samples were burned under O2-limited conditions were designated as "O2-limited" (Wiesenberg et al., 2009;Keiluweit et al., 2012;Santín et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>None of the studies specified packing or arrangement of the fuel beds. Physiochemical properties (such as porosity and aromaticity) of burn products can differ between natural and laboratory conditions (Santín et al., 2017). In previous individual reports, PAH concentrations and distributions appeared to be less influenced by experimental apparatus and were more dependent on fuel type and temperature (Santín et al., 2017). We assessed this with our larger compilation of new and published data representing molecular and isotopic properties of PAHs under a wide variety of experimental conditions (Table 1).</p>
        <p>Samples were collected as either smoke (including air-borne gases, aerosols, and particles) from burn emissions or as solid residues. Smoke samples were collected via filtration or condensation (O' Malley and Burke, 1997;Oros and Simoneit, 2001b;Oros and Simoneit, 2001a;Oros et al., 2006;Guillon et al., 2013). Residue samples included all charred material left behind after combustion (this study; Wiesenberg et al., 2009;Keiluweit et al., 2012;Santín et al., 2017). Residues are typically dominated by larger charcoal and ash particles (µm-mm), while smoke samples tend to include mostly small soot and black carbon particles (2-50 µm; Masiello, 2004).</p>
        <p>All statistical analyses were conducted in the programing environment of 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">R Core Team</rs>, 2019). Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to evaluate if concentrations differed under different burn conditions (Hollander and Wolfe, 1973). This metric was chosen because concentration data spanned several orders of magnitude, thus the normal distribution assumption of an ANOVA test would be invalid. Kruskal-Wallis tests assume homoscedasticity, that is, all groups have equal variances (Hollander and Wolfe, 1973). Levene's test (Levene, 1960) revealed all conditions had p-values &gt;0.01, confirming both homogeneity in variances and that Kruskal-Wallis tests could be used for this dataset.
        </p>
        <p>Multiple linear regression (MLR) was conducted to examine which of the burn conditions had the greatest effect on the residue PAH concentrations. Concentration data was log transformed in order to resemble a normal distribution. Regression was conducted with the burn temperature, O2 content, and growth form using the 'GLM' function. Since growth form and plant functional type are dependent, plant functional type was excluded from the analysis.</p>
        <p>Categorical variables were converted to factors for this analysis. Unstandardized coefficients were compared to examine the relative effect of each variable.</p>
        <p>Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to examine the main influences on the distributions of PAHs. NMDS is an iterative method that maximizes rank-order correlations in ordination space based on a distance metric (Kruskal, 1964). Many samples had PAHs below detection limits and therefore the datasets are not normally distributed. These "zero" abundance values can distort results in methods that assume normally distributed data (i.e., PCA) but not for parametric methods that use sample rankings (i.e., NMDS;(McCune and Grace, 2002).</p>
        <p>Prior to NMDS, PAH abundances were logarithmically transformed and individual PAH concentrations were then normalized to the sum total of all PAHs in a sample. NMDS was performed with the Bray Curtis dissimilarity metric and the 'metaMDS' function from the package 'vegan' (Oksanen et al., 2018). Stress was minimized to 0.118, with two convergent solutions after 20 tries. Stress of &lt;0.15 is considered reliable (McCune and Grace, 2002). R 2 values between ordination distance and dissimilarity were 0.95 for a linear fit and 0.99 for a nonmetric fit, indicating the method maximized dissimilarity in the dataset. The function 'envfit' from the package 'vegan' was used to interpret the NMDS by testing correlations between the measured experimental conditions and the ordination of samples in multiple dimensions (Oksanen et al., 2018). Additionally, Spearman's rank correlations (ρ) were conducted between NMDS axis scores and each variable to examine which experimental conditions correlated with each axis. The significance of these correlations was evaluated using a repeated permutation test (n=1000; Oksanen et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>We evaluated the utility of indices and molecular ratios based on published studies and also proposed new molecular indices based on patterns that emerged from statistical analyses of data in this study. Because the data used in these metrics are relatively straightforward to determine by GC-MS analyses, they offer potentially useful ways to assess sources of PAHs in sedimentary records.</p>
        <p>Alkylated homologs of phenanthrene are widely used to distinguish PAH petrogenic inputs (Laflamme and Hites, 1978;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015;Rocha and Palma, 2019).</p>
        <p>Generally, authors use normalized distributions that do not take all of the information from a full distribution into account (i.e., Pyrogenic Index, MP/P; Wang et al., 1999;Yunker et al., 2002;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015;Rocha and Palma, 2019). Typically, the number of methyl groups decreases for pyrogenic samples, yielding a convex-up shape, while alkylated forms in petrogenic samples define a rising, concave-up curve (Blumer and Youngblood, 1975;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015). Here, the zero-to tri-methylated phenanthrene distributions were fit to a parabolic function. The function direction and shape are described using its first (ƒ'(x)) and second derivatives (ƒ''(x)), respectively. For a parabolic curve:</p>
        <p>Alkylated PAH Derivative Index (APDI) takes into account both shape and direction of the profiles for zero-to-three methylated phenanthrenes (Table 2):</p>
        <p>APDI values are negative for petrogenic samples (concave, increasing) and positive for pyrogenic profiles (convex, decreasing). APDI can also be applied to other alkylated homologs (i.e., pyrene, and chrysene).</p>
        <p>Dimethyl phenanthrenes (DMP) originate from degradation of softwoods (conifers), hardwoods (angiosperm trees), and grasses (Simoneit, 1986;Benner et al., 1995;Kappenberg et al., 2019). To evaluate DMP products for the plant types and experimental conditions in this study, we used the two ratios reported in Table 2 ( Kappenberg et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>PAHs molecule size aligned strongly along NMDS 1 (Fig. 2a), with the largest PAHs (6 rings) to the smallest (3 rings) running from negative to positive values on this axis. Based on this strong gradient, we defined the ratio LMW/Total (Table 2), and evaluated how well this potential proxy captured the influence of burn phase and other conditions on molecular size distributions.</p>
        <p>The alkylated three-ringed PAH, retene, is a known gymnosperm burn product. It strongly separated out from other 3-ringed PAHs on the NMDS 2 axis (Fig. 2a). Based on this pattern, we defined the ratio Ret/3-ring (Table 2), and evaluated its utility as a source proxy for gymnosperm burn products.</p>
        <p>Two quantitative measures of PAH abundances are found in published studies: fire scientists report burn products as emission factors, while organic geochemists report compounds relative to the mass of extracted material. In the published data compiled for this study, PAHs in residues were reported relative to the burned material (ng/g material extracted; Wiesenberg et al., 2009;Keiluweit et al., 2012), while those in smoke were expressed relative to the initial biomass (ng/g material combusted; Oros and Simoneit, 2001a). Thus, we treated mass-normalized compound quantities in each phase separately (Fig. 3; discussed below) and compared prominent compounds normalized to total PAHs in each phase (Section 3.2.1). More speculatively, we estimated emission factors for residue PAH for comparison with published smoke data (discussed in Section 4.1.3).</p>
        <p>In residues, total parent PAH concentrations spanned five orders of magnitude (10-10,000 ng/g extracted) and averaged 2203 ng/g, with a median of 442 ng/g (Fig. 3a). Abundances were most strongly influenced by burn temperature p&lt;0.001; MLR, coefficient=0.89; Fig. 4b), followed by oxygen limitation p&lt;0.05; MLR, coefficient=0.69; Fig. 3c). Residues from burns at temperatures between 300-600°C contained an order of magnitude higher PAH concentrations (500-5000 ng/g) than residues from cooler (&lt;300°C; 50-500 ng/g) or hotter (600°C; 10-100 ng/g) burns (Fig. 2b; Fig. 3). PAH concentrations (log values) had a quadratic relationship with temperature (R 2 = 0.26, p&lt;0.005) and a maximum (10 4 ) at 500 °C (Fig. 3b). The influence of temperature persisted for different fuel types (woody or grassy) and for O2 limited conditions (Fig. 4d; Fig. 4e; Fig. 4f), although correlations were no longer statistically significant due to a reduction in sample size. Notably, the influence of temperature was not present for burns under atmospheric O2 conditions (Fig. 4c).</p>
        <p>In smoke samples, parent PAH concentrations spanned five orders of magnitude (10-10,000 ng/g combusted), averaged 7451 ng/g (Fig. 3a), with a median of 5242 ng/g (Fig. 3a). Fuel type had a significant (p&lt;0.001) effect on PAHs concentrations (Fig. 4. Woody smoke samples contained an order of magnitude (5000-10,000 ng/g) more PAHs than grass samples (500-1000 ng/g; Fig. 3d).</p>
        <p>Quantities of each compound were normalized to the total 13 compounds targeted for study. Phenanthrene was the most abundant compound in about half of the angiosperm samples, and either pyrene or fluoranthene were most abundant in the other half (Fig. A1). Gymnosperm samples were dominated mostly (50%) by retene and sometimes (35%) by phenanthrene (Fig. A1).</p>
        <p>NMDS analysis revealed robust patterns among individual PAHs and samples. Plant functional type, burn phase, and O2 conditions all correlated with PAH distributions (r 2 = 0.37, p&lt;0.001; r 2 = 0.24; p&lt;0.001; r 2 = 0.20, p&lt;0.01), while highest temperature of the burn (HTT) did not (r 2 = 0.08, p=0.152). In addition to the strong gradient in PAH size along NMDS-1, values on this axis also significantly correlated with sample burn phase (ρ = -0.48, p&lt;0.001; Fig. 2), with the largest PAHs prevalent in residues and the smallest in smoke. Oxygen levels also correlated with NMDS-1 values (ρ = -0.52, p&lt;0.001). Retene had a distinctively negative NMDS 2 score.</p>
        <p>Notably, plant functional type significantly correlated to NMDS 2 (ρ = -0.66 p&lt;0.001; Fig. 2), and woody gymnosperm samples all fell on the negative side of NMDS 2 (Fig. 2). We reevaluated the NMDS after removing retene to test for PAH distributions that may have been masked by the strength of its signal (Fig. A5). Similar to previous studies (Simoneit, 2002;Guillon et al., 2013), when retene was excluded, plant functional type no longer correlated well to parent PAH distributions (r 2 = 0.11, p &gt; 0.06).</p>
        <p>As all samples in this study were produced by combustion of plants, they were expected to display the distinctive "staircase" distributions of declining abundance from 0-to 3-methyl groups (Blumer and Youngblood, 1975;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015) and positive values of the alkylated PAH derivative index (APDI). This was the case for over 75% of the samples (Fig. 5a; Fig. 5c). Interestingly, ~25% of the samples did not display the typical pyrogenic pattern (Fig. 5b). Anomalous alkylation patterns were not related to temperature, oxygen, or burn phase, and were mostly associated with woody gymnosperm samples (conifers; Fig. 5b). We caution that burns fueled by conifers can produce alkylation patterns and APDI values that appear "petrogenic".</p>
        <p>δ 13 C values of individual PAHs ranged between -32.0‰ and -14.1‰ (Fig. 6a) and differed as expected for C4 and C3 plants (~12‰; Fig. 6). Values for PAHs derived from C4 plants ranged between -14.1‰ and -17.5‰. Among the C3 plant samples, PAH from grasses were generally the most 13 C-depleted (-30‰), woody plants were intermediate, and those from C3 shrubs the most enriched (-26‰; Fig. 6b; Fig. 6c; Fig. 6d). PAHs from C3 woody angiosperms were generally more depleted in 13 C than those from C3 woody gymnosperms (Fig. 6). There were no isotopic trends among the 3-ring and 4-ring PAHs within samples (Fig. 6).</p>
        <p>Fractionation factors (εPAH-Plant, ‰) were calculated to determine the isotopic difference between unburnt biomass and individual compounds (Coplen, 2011; Fig. 7):</p>
        <p>PAHs produced from burned C3 woody samples were enriched relative to biomass (εave = 3.9‰), while PAHs from C3 and C4 non-woody fuels differed little from biomass values (εave = -0.1 ‰; Fig. 7). There were no systematic trends related to ring size (Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>Here, we discuss how the results of this analysis may improve interpretations of PAHs in the sedimentary record. We address the aims of this study by identifying which burn conditions may bias PAH production (4.1), how fuel source and transport processes imprint information on molecular distributions (4.2), and if burn process fractionation impacts the fuel source signals preserved in PAH carbon isotope values (4.3).</p>
        <p>PAH production in residues, particularly for O2-limited burns, is maximized between 400-500 °C (Fig. 3b; Fig. 4). In contrast, temperature did not significantly affect PAH concentrations for samples burned exclusively under atmospheric conditions (Fig. 4c), presumably because O2 was readily available and combustion more efficient.</p>
        <p>The temperature sensitivity observed in our study is consistent with previous observations (e.g., Keiluweit et al., 2012;McGrath et al., 2003) that PAHs are formed via different pathways along a temperature continuum. At low temperatures (&lt; 400 o C), dehydration dominates small PAH formation (Simoneit, 1998;Keiluweit et al., 2012), while at higher temperatures (&gt;500 o C) free radical condensation dominates (Simoneit, 1998;McGrath et al., 2003;Lima et al., 2005). These processes produce a thermal "sweet spot." At low temperatures, PAH yield is low because small (≤ 2 ring) PAHs are not fully condensed, and at high temperatures, PAHs are either incorporated into larger aromatic particles (&gt;8 rings) or fully combusted. At 500 °C, both processes likely take place and form an amorphous char consisting mostly of mid-sized PAHs (3-7 rings) and other dehydrated alteration products, thus maximizing PAH yields (Keiluweit et al., 2010;Keiluweit et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>PAH concentrations in sedimentary records are potentially biased toward average wildfire temperatures, which typically occur between 300 and 600 °C (mid-range; Wright and Bailey, 1982;Wolf et al., 2013). Fires that burn at either extremely low (&lt;300 °C) or high (&gt;600 °C) temperatures are likely underrepresented in molecular archives.</p>
        <p>Production bias may result from large shifts in fire type (Scott, 2000). For example, decreased PAH concentrations may reflect a transition from predominately flaming forest fires to smoldering peat fires, rather than less fire occurrence. The use of a fire temperature proxy, such as inertinite reflectance in charcoal or benzene polycarboxylic acid ratios may be one way to identify if a paleofire burned at an extreme low or high temperatures that could have biased PAH production (Conedera et al., 2009;Kappenberg et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Burns of woody vegetation produced an order of magnitude more PAHs in smoke than grassy vegetation (Fig. 3; Fig. 4d). Further, woody ecosystems produce significantly more aboveground biomass than grasslands (Whittaker and Likens, 1973), even though grassland systems generally burn much more (10-100x) frequently than most forest biomes (Archibald et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>Normalizing PAH concentrations to a plant biomarker (e.g., n-alkanes or terpenoids) can help partially account for this PAH production bias (Denis et al., 2017;Karp et al., 2018), assuming the plant biomarker reasonably represents burned biomass.</p>
        <p>Plant biomarkers are subject to transport and production biases. For example, certain leaf waxes are preferentially produced by different plant types (Freeman and Pancost, 2014; Diefendorf and Freimuth, 2017) and differential transport between PAHs and biomarkers can have additional effects (Denis et al., 2017). Future core-top calibration studies could help constrain these considerations for both fire and plant biomarkers, particularly if combined with data for plant communities and fire histories.</p>
        <p>Despite remaining uncertainties, PAH-plant biomarker normalization was successfully used in studies that examined fire ecology changes during the Neogene. PAH amounts normalized to a plant biomarker increased by an order of magnitude and were highly correlated with evidence for C4 grass inputs (Karp et al., 2018). These results suggest the PAH production bias between wood-smoke and grass-smoke does not impede grass fire records when normalized and integrated over deep timescales and for major ecosystem transitions.</p>
        <p>The potential for wood smoke inputs to obscure a grass-associated increase in fire occurrence likely depends on the duration of time integrated in a record. Higher-resolution temporal records may be more susceptible to source-related production bias, as they include fewer individual fire events. Plant-biomarker-normalized PAH concentrations may be particularly useful for reconstructing grassland fires, as charcoal from grass tends to be underrepresented in sedimentary records (Hilscher and Knicker, 2011;Leys et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Available data for PAH abundances were normalized differently for smoke and for solid burn residues, which prevented direct comparison between the two phases. To get around this challenge, we estimated PAH residue emission factors (ng/material combusted) using some simple assumptions and mass loss constraints published in the literature (Czimczik et al., 2002;Collura et al., 2005).</p>
        <p>Based on the burn temperature and plant functional type for each sample, we assigned a % mass loss relative to the initial unburnt fuel using thermogravimetric data from experimentally burned softwood (Czimczik et al., 2002), hardwood (Czimczik et al., 2002), and grass (Collura et al., 2005) chars. The loss term was converted to a mass ratio of residue/total unburnt biomass, which was then multiplied by measured PAH concentrations normalized to material extracted (ng/g). This converted PAH concentrations into units of ng/g unburnt material, which approximates estimated emission factors for residue samples so they can be compared with smoke data.</p>
        <p>Parent PAH concentrations in the residues had significantly lower emission factors than smoke (&lt;0.001; Fig. 8). Residue parent PAH concentrations averaged 1214 ng/g material combusted, which is 7x less than the average for smoke (7451 ng/g material combusted). If this difference in emission factors is representative for natural burns, then PAH records mostly represent smoke inputs relative to char residues. This inference is consistent with environmental studies that found PAHs and other char parameters were decoupled in recent sedimentary records (Denis et al., 2012;Hanke et al., 2016;Hanke et al., 2017), and that PAH concentrations were more strongly associated with soot than chars (Han et al., 2015). We caution field observations may be influenced by fossil fuel combustion (Hanke et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Future studies in regions not impacted by anthropogenic air pollution will strengthen our understanding of the degree to which regional signals are recorded by smoke-derived PAHs, and local fire patterns are recorded by charcoal in the same sedimentary record (Hanke et al., 2017;Miller et al., 2017). We recommend future studies directly compare PAH emission factors (ng/g biomass burned) for both smoke and residues. This normalization is particularly useful for paleoproxy comparisons that normalize PAH concentrations to proxies for plant biomass.</p>
        <p>Previous authors have suggested fire temperature (McGrath et al., 2003;McBeath et al., 2011;Wiedemeier et al., 2015b) and O2 content (Lima et al., 2005) significantly determine PAH molecular distribution patterns. Changes in sedimentary PAH size distributions have been attributed to changes in fire temperature and intensity (Denis et al., 2012). However, this interpretation is not supported by this or previous studies (Lima et al., 2005) in which PAH distribution patterns were most strongly linked to the burn phase (residue or smoke; Fig. 2). The pronounced PAH size difference between smoke and residues provides a useful means to estimate which burn phase contributed PAHs to a sedimentary record. Further, size sorting of either waterborne or air-borne smoke and char particles has potential to imprint on PAH distributions as they are transported and deposited in sediments.</p>
        <p>PAHs in smoke can persist in the gas phase, although larger forms will sorb to particles (Dachs and Eisenreich, 2000;Han et al., 2010;Jenkins et al., 1996;Shen et al., 2011). In contrast, solid residues include a full range of PAH structures including condensed high-molecular-weight PAHs (McGrath et al., 2003;Lima et al., 2005). Larger PAHs (with low Vp, Cw sat , and high Kow) will sorb primarily to organic residues in the solid phase and are less likely to volatilize and subsequently sorb to airborne particles.</p>
        <p>Because they mostly reflect molecular size, molecule NMDS 1 scores had strong loglinear relationships with Kow, Vp, and Cw sat values (Fig. 9). This suggests NMDS 1 scores reflect these physical properties, rather than simply size of the molecule. For example, NMDS 1 scores break between two pairs of 4-ringed compounds: the more condensed pyrene and fluoranthene (Py, Flu; MW 202) and the more linear-shaped benz[a]anthracene and chrysene (Chry, BaA; MW 228). Chemical properties for the two pairs of structures strongly differ: three orders of magnitude in Vp, two orders of magnitude in Cw sat , and an order of magnitude in KOW (Fig. 9).</p>
        <p>Many studies sort PAHs by numbers of rings (e.g., Dong et al., 2012;Han et al., 2015;Callegaro et al., 2018;Rocha and Palma, 2019), even though physical properties dictate PAH solubility, volatility, and other behaviors in the environment (Fraser et al., 1998;Lima et al., 2005). We recommend proxy tools involving PAH are based on solubility and other physical or chemical properties rather than on the number of rings. For example, due to their different shapes (which set both molecule surface areas and molecular volumes), the physicochemical properties of Flu and Pyr are similar to 3-ring PAHs, and those of Chry and BaA are similar to 5-ring PAHs (Fig. 9). So, while Flu and Pyr were prominent in smoke along with other 4-ring forms (Fig, A2), Chry dominated PAH in residues (Fig. A2).</p>
        <p>We suggest the LMW/Total ratio in sedimentary archives can potentially distinguish relative smoke and char inputs and incorporate the influence of transport. Based on NMDS results, we defined the LMW/total ratio (Table 2) to represent PAH with masses ≤202 AMU relative to total parent PAHs (Fig. 1 for abbreviations), similar other studies (Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015). The ratio ranged between 1.00 and 0.75 (µ=0.85) in smoke samples and was lower in residues, ranging between 0.40 and 0.80 (µ=0.64; Fig. 10a). Calculated LMW/Total for environmental data reported in the literature (Olivella et al., 2006;Alves et al., 2011;Vicente et al., 2011;Vicente et al., 2012;Harper et al., 2019) for smoke (µ=0.75, n=6) and residues (µ=0.65, n=9) fell within ranges observed in this study.</p>
        <p>Smoke particles are emitted into the troposphere, aerially transported, and travel far from the source (Ferrare et al., 1990). Char can also be emitted into the troposphere, where transport distances depend on the particle size and shape (Peters and Higuera, 2007;Vachula and Richter, 2017). Char residues are subject to secondary transport via wind, water, or soil processes, or they can be stored in soils before being remobilized to downstream sediment archives (Conedera et al., 2009;Santín et al., 2016;Hanke et al., 2017). While uncertainties remain in constraining charcoal transport and incorporation into sedimentary archives (Conedera et al., 2009;Vachula and Richter, 2017), char residues generally remain closer to the site of production (Bird et al., 2015), and record more localized fire events (Conedera et al., 2009).</p>
        <p>Due to size differences between char particles (10-100s µm) and fine aerosol particles (&lt;2.5 µm) in smoke, char particles are typically transported several orders of magnitude shorter distances (10 -2 -10 km; Peters and Higuera, 2007;Vachula and Richter, 2017) than smoke aerosols (10 2 -10 4 km; e.g., Wu et al., 2018;Sicard et al., 2019). In the environment, volatile LMW PAHs are deposited further from a combustion source while particle-associated HMW PAHs are deposited closer to the source (Halsall et al., 2001;Ma et al., 2013). In soils, HMW PAHs are present in higher concentrations closer to point pollution sources as indicated by their correlation with black carbon deposition (Nam et al., 2008;Nam et al., 2009;Han et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>The biodegradation rate of PAHs in the environment is controlled by aqueous solubility, , and LMW PAHs are highly susceptible to loss (Fig. 9a; Fig. 9c; Lima et al., 2005;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015;González-Gaya et al., 2019). Alkylated forms are less susceptible to biodegradation (Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015;Kang et al., 2016) because they are less soluble than parent PAHs and the methyl sites hinder biodegradation initiated by ring hydroxylation (Mallick et al., 2011). Biodegradation will therefore increase the LMW/total ratio and shift the APDI metric toward more negative values. Although more studies are needed, anomalous APDI values may help identify the influence of degradation on PAH size distributions, while complimentary sedimentary (i.e., mineralogical and grain size analyses) and bulk black carbon (i.e., size and concentration measurements) data can also strengthen interpretations of LMW/Total as an indicator of changing smoke and residue inputs.</p>
        <p>Unlike parent PAH distributions (Lima et al., 2005;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015), retene can serve as an indicator of plant type burned in a fire. A degradation product of abietic acid, retene is a marker of burn products from conifers (Simoneit, 1977;Wakeham et al., 1980;Oros and Simoneit, 2001a). We defined Ret/3-ring to highlight this source signal by accounting for the potential influence of burn phase, transport, and biodegradation. Angiosperm samples had consistently low Ret/3-ring values (&lt;0.1), while gymnosperm values were higher, but ranged widely (0.2-0.8; Fig. 10b). We suggest low Ret/3-ring values generally identify burned plant communities in which conifers were rare. Interpretations may be checked by cross plotting or calculating correlation coefficients of Ret/3-ring with other proxies for gymnosperms relative to angiosperms, such as the diterpenoid to n-alkane ratio (Diefendorf et al., 2014) or pollen analyses.</p>
        <p>In this study, as in previous reports, dimethyl phenanthrenes (DMP) highly correlated with plant functional types, consistent with their known origin as degradation products of softwoods (conifers), hardwoods (angiosperm trees), and grasses (Fig. 11;Simoneit, 1986;Benner et al., 1995;Kappenberg et al., 2019). DMP isomers associated with softwoods are usually sourced from Pinaceae, rather than gymnosperms more generally (Yunker et al., 2002;Kappenberg et al., 2019). Consistent with this, both DMP ratios for Ginkgo biloba sorted with the hardwood samples, even though it is a cone-producing gymnosperm (Fig. 11). Ratios for Triticum spp. were lower than reported by Kappenberg et al. (2019) and plotted with the hardwood samples (Fig. 11). Additionally, the DMP-x ratio for one eucalypt plotted with the grass samples (Fig. 11). DMP-x ratios between 0.55 and 0.7 may reflect mixed hardwood and grass inputs.</p>
        <p>These differences from the initial ranges suggested in Kappenberg et al. (2019) highlight the need for additional studies with more diverse plant types to improve classifications from these ratios.</p>
        <p>Regardless, DMP-x, DMP-y, and Ret/3-ring ratios are promising tools to track combusted plant communities in sedimentary records.</p>
        <p>While most samples in this study had the expected pyrogenic distributions for alkylated phenanthrenes (Fig. 5a), several conifers did not (Fig. 5b). Conifers produce triterpenoids that share the 3-ring structure of phenanthrene, such as abiatanes, pimaranes and tetracyclics (Simoneit, 1986;Diefendorf et al., 2019). Degradation products such as 1,7dimethylphenanthrene and 1,2,8-trimethylphenanthrene have been attributed to the alteration of pimarane and phyllocladane (Simoneit, 1977;Simoneit, 1986;Budzinski et al., 1995;Benner et al., 1995;Grice et al., 2001;Oros and Simoneit, 2001a;Yunker et al., 2002;Stogiannidis and Laane, 2015). We suggest anomalously elevated alkyl phenanthrene distributions (negative APDI values) can reflect a conifer source rather than petrogenic PAHs, and can be checked using the Ret/3-ring ratio.</p>
        <p>PAH carbon isotope values strongly reflected their burned plant sources, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 6; O' Malley et al., 1994;O' Malley and Burke, 1997). C3 plants display a broad range of carbon isotope values (Deines, 1980;Farquhar et al., 1989;Tipple and Pagani, 2007;Diefendorf and Freimuth, 2017), reflecting the influence of environmental (i.e., water availability, pCO2, light) and biological (i.e., taxonomy) variables (Diefendorf et al., 2010;Graham et al., 2014). Similarly, C3-derived PAHs varied by ~8‰, while C4-derived PAHs fell within a narrow range (~3‰). PAHs from woody angiosperms were 1-3‰ more depleted in 13 C than those from woody gymnosperms (Fig. 6), consistent with isotope differences observed for these plant groups (Leavitt and Newberry, 1992;Diefendorf et al., 2010). PAHs from C3 grass were the most depleted in 13 C among all C3 plant types (Fig. 6), consistent with C3 grass biomass values (Arens et al., 2000).</p>
        <p>Fractionation factors enabled us to compared δ 13 C measurements between individual molecules and plant material used in the burns. The εPAH-plant values for PAHs from from all plants analyzed in this study were generally within plus or minus one permil (±1‰; Fig. 7), with no systematic direction. We note that because mostly leaves were archived, bulk biomass isotope values from woody plants underrepresent carbon from wood. There is little difference between leaf and wood for most plants, although this is not true for Eucalypts, for which wood is ~3‰ more enriched than leaves (Schulze et al., 2006). Thus, epsilon values for Eucalypts were corrected assuming a wood-to-leaf mass ratio of 9:1 (Ribeiro et al., 2015). When this correction was applied, εPAH-plant values for all PAHs were ± ~1‰ (Fig. 7). C4 non-woody pyrene was the only exception, with a slightly greater εPAH-plant value (1.6‰; Fig. 7). PAHs form through radical reactions and condensation of organic fragments at high temperatures (Richter and Howard, 2000). The close isotopic relationship between biomass and PAHs indicate that the molecular fragments were not derived from an isotopically distinct compound class or fractionated during condensation.</p>
        <p>In contrast to our finding for residue samples, O'Malley and Burke (1997) observed PAHs in smoke were ~2‰ depleted relative to plant biomass (Fig. 7) and proposed that PAHs were preferentially sourced from lignin. In published studies, δ 13 C values of bulk residues were similar to plant biomass (&lt;1‰), while values for bulk aerosol carbon were variable (1-7‰), particularly for C4 plants (Turekian et al., 1995;Turekian et al., 1998). Preferential volatilization of 13 C-depleted, labile components (Turekian et al., 1998) or as originally suggested, isotopic distinctions among the sources (such as lignin) for radicals that form PAHs in the smoke phase potentially account for isotopic depletion in smoke PAHs observed by O' Malley and Burke (1997).</p>
        <p>Surveys of bulk carbon isotope work on pyrogenic carbon also indicate that O2 content and temperature may impact the magnitude of fractionation due to differential loss of 13 C enriched cellulose (Bird and Ascough, 2012 and references herein). While environmental studies suggest O2 and temperature do not influence PAH δ 13 C values (O'Malley et al., 1994;Holman and Grice, 2018), more work is needed, given only two studies to date (this study and O' Malley and Burke, 1997) have measured δ 13 C of both PAHs and the unburnt plant material.</p>
        <p>Isotopic records of bulk pyrogenic carbon phases are widely used to reconstruct changes in plant community burning (e.g., Shen et al., 2018;Bird et al., 2019), but this technique is complicated by preferential loss, heterogeneity, transport, and preservation (Turekian et al., 1998;Bird and Ascough, 2012;Saiz et al., 2015). While compound-specific isotope measurements are more analytically intensive, they eliminate some of the uncertainties associated with mixed bulk isotope measurements (Freeman and Pancost, 2014). The large differences between PAHs derived from C3 and C4 plant biomass and low fractionation between PAHs and unburned biomass indicate that PAHs have great potential to serve as a proxy for burned vegetation in sedimentary records.</p>
        <p>However, because of production biases, it is not straightforward to use PAH isotope abundances to estimate relative contribution of C3 woody and C3 grass fuels to paleo wildfires.</p>
        <p>Wood-derived smoke contains a higher abundance of PAHs (Fig. 3; Fig. 4d), while PAHs from grass ecosystems can be elevated because they burn more frequently than forests. Additionally, C3 grasses had more negative δ 13 C values than woody plants, which may negatively skew C3 endmembers. General, large-scale shifts in C3 and C4 burning through time can be derived with carbon isotope measurements of PAHs in sediments. Isotope data can be compared with alkylated PAH ratios, such as DMP-y, as well as to source-specific plant biomarkers (based on lignin monomers, alkane distributions or terpenoid biomarkers; Freeman and Pancost, 2014) to help constrain plant sources. Uncertainties in relative production is a problem that many paleo proxies (i.e., n-alkanes, pollen) must address in order to translate into quantitative estimates of plant types on a landscape.</p>
        <p>This work evaluated the amounts, distributions, and isotopic signatures of PAHs produced from burned plant samples. Relative to burned biomass, estimated emission factors for PAHs in smoke are many times greater than for char, such that inputs to the sedimentary record are biased toward smoke-borne compounds. PAH molecular distributions reflect both plant sources and burn phase, but not burn temperatures. PAH size distributions quantified in NMDS analyses and by LMW/Total ratios reflected structure-specific chemical-physical properties that dictate partitioning between solid residue and smoke burn phases. We caution size distributions can be influenced by particle sorting during transport of burn phases or biodegradation. Alkylated PAHs reflect plant types consistent with previous work. In particular, retene and dimethyl phenanthrene ratios distinguished gymnosperms from angiosperms, and woody angiosperms from grasses and woody gymnosperms. δ 13 C values of PAHs were not fractionated relative to plant biomass values, and reflected plant function types and their photosynthetic pathway.</p>
        <p>Overall, both relative abundances and carbon isotopes of PAHs in the sedimentary record can record burned plant communities, while size patterns reflect burned particle phase and transport (Fig. 12). To reconstruct fire occurrence and account for production biases, sedimentary PAHs abundances in sediment records should be normalized to a plant biomarkers. The framework presented here improves the interpretability of PAHs as a proxy for changes in paleofire regimes.</p>
