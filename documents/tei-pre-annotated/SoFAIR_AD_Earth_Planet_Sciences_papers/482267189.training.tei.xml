        <p>Concept-based orogenic gold exploration requires a scale-integrated approach using a robust mineral system model. Most genetic hypotheses for orogenic gold deposits that involve near-surface or magmatic-hydrothermal fluids are now negated in terms of a global mineral system model. Plausible models involve metamorphic fluids, but the fluid source has been equivocal. Crustal metamorphic-fluid models are most widely-accepted but there are serious problems for Archean deposits, and numerous Chinese provinces, including Jiaodong, where the only feasible fluid source is sub-crustal. If all orogenic gold deposits define a coherent mineral system, there are only two realistic sources of fluid and gold, based on their syn-mineralization geodynamic settings. These are from devolatilization of a subducted oceanic slab with its overlying gold-bearing sulfide-rich sedimentary package, or release from mantle lithosphere that was metasomatized and fertilized during a subduction event, particularly adjacent to craton margins. In this model, CO 2 is generated during decarbonation and S and ore-related elements released from transformation of pyrite to pyrrhotite at about 500 C. This orogenic gold mineral system can be applied to conceptual exploration by first identifying the required settings at geodynamic to deposit scales. Within these settings, it is then possible to define the critical gold mineralization processes in the system: fertility, architecture, and preservation. The geological parameters that define these processes, and the geological, geophysical and geochemical proxies and responses for these critical parameters can then be identified. At the geodynamic to province scales, critical processes include a tectonic thermal engine and deep, effective, fluid plumbing system driven by seismic swarms up lithosphere-scale faults in an oblique-slip regime during uplift late in the orogenic cycle of a convergent margin. At the district to deposit scale, the important processes are fluid focussing into regions of complex structural geometry adjacent to crustal-scale plumbing systems, with gold deposition in trap sites involving complex conjugations of competent and/or reactive rock sequences and structural or lithological fluid caps. Critical indirect responses to defined parameters change from those generated by geophysics to those generated by geochemistry with reduction in scale of the mineral system-driven conceptual exploration.Concept-based orogenic gold exploration requires a scale-integrated approach using a robust mineral system model.

        <p>There are broadly two types of mineral exploration, commonly termed brownfield and greenfield exploration. Brownfield exploration involves exploration within, or in close proximity to, existing mineral deposits. Such exploration has the potential to provide continued production into the immediate to foreseeable future. For example, a very good case is mounted by Vearncombe and Phillips (2019) for the gold deposits of the Yilgarn Block of Western Australia. However, in the longer term, greenfield exploration is required to replenish depleted resources and maintain long-term production. This may be carried out distant from already-discovered deposits in known well-endowed mineral provinces (McCuaig et al., 2010), or in new exploration spaces with limited pre-competitive data (Joly et al., 2010). Unfortunately, mineral exploration, particularly in greenfields, is currently an inefficient process with discovery rates, particularly for gold, slowing significantly in the 21st Century (Schodde, 2017). This is despite increased exploration expenditure, as explorers are increasingly required to explore under regolith cover in available exploration spaces.There are broadly two types of mineral exploration, commonly termed brownfield and greenfield exploration.

        <p>As Hronsky and Groves (2008) discuss, conceptual geological targeting is required as an initial step to focus exploration into the most prospective districts within potentially well-endowed terranes or provinces. As a crucial first step, this requires the establishment of superior predictive geological models for the deposit type that is sought by the greenfield exploration program. This paper seeks to establish such a holistic model, via a mineral systems approach, for orogenic gold deposits. This is followed by discussion of the geological, geophysical and geochemical proxies for the various parameters required to adapt the conceptual model into a pragmatic exploration targeting model. The paper does not discuss the various methodologies that attempt to provide a quantitative measure of the endowment of any particular orogenic gold province (see Davies et al., 2018Davies et al., , 2019 and references therein for a recent review of a specific belt). It rather discusses the proxies for critical conceptual parameters that should drive identification of prospective orogenic gold provinces and geoscientific exploration within them.As Hronsky and Groves (2008) discuss, conceptual geological targeting is required as an initial step to focus exploration into the most prospective districts within potentially well-endowed terranes or provinces.

        <p>Research into genetic models for mineralization systems has gradually evolved over time from purely deposit-based models to more holistic models that view the mineralization processes in a hierarchical manner from geodynamic setting through province-through district-to depositscale. This mineral systems concept was first formulated by Wyborn et al. (1994) and championed by Knox-Robinson and Wyborn (1997) and Hronsky and Groves (2008), but it is only in the last decade that it has reached prominence as a critical approach in conceptual targeting (McCuaig et al., 2010;McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014;Hagemann et al., 2016;Huston et al., 2016;Wyman et al., 2016). The mineral systems model requires a fertile ore-component source in a suitable geodynamic setting with favourable linked lithosphere and crustal architecture for ore-fluid migration to a trap site, with suitable post-mineralization tectonic processes to ensure preservation (McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014). It is the multiplication effect of the conjunction of essential components of the mineral system (Fig. 1) that determines if an ore body forms and dictates its size and economic value (Megill, 1988). Based on these concepts and the evidence that ore-forming systems, like earthquakes, are rare events that have power-law distributions, Hronsky (2011) introduced the concept that large mineral deposits are examples of self-organised critical systems involving transfer of anomalously high energy and fluid fluxes into the crust. Wyman et al. (2016) and Hronsky (2019) have aligned this concept into the field of orogenic gold deposits, as discussed further below.Research into genetic models for mineralization systems has gradually evolved over time from purely deposit-based models to more holistic models that view the mineralization processes in a hierarchical manner from geodynamic setting through province-through district-to depositscale.

        <p>The term orogenic gold deposit was defined by Groves et al. (1998), following Gebre-Mariam et al. (1995), as a coherent group of vertically-extensive, gold-only deposits that formed in broad thermal equilibrium with their wall-rocks from low-salinity H 2 O-CO 2 ore fluids at crustal depths from 2 km to 15 km, and arguably up to 20 km (Groves, 1993;Kolb and Meyer, 2002;Kolb et al., 2005aKolb et al., , 2005bKolb et al., , 2015)). Although this term is widely accepted (Goldfarb et al., 2001(Goldfarb et al., , 2005(Goldfarb et al., , 2014a;;Bierlein et al., 2006), there is ongoing debate on the genesis of this deposit group. Goldfarb and Groves (2015) provide an exhaustive review of these genetic models and the various geological, geochemical, isotopic and fluid-inclusion constraints on the component ore fluids and gold-related metals that formed orogenic gold deposits. All models depicted schematically in Fig. 2 are described and assessed in detail by Goldfarb and Groves (2015), who also provide exhaustive references to numerous individual examples.The term orogenic gold deposit was defined by Groves et al.

        <p>The models (Fig. 2a) shown to be less-viable by Goldfarb and Groves (2015) include early syngenetic-exhalative models which are inconsistent with field evidence that shows the deposits are structurally-controlled, syn-to late-metamorphic deposits with stratiform to stratabound BIF-hosted deposits formed by sulfidation of magnetite (Phillips et al., 1984). Similarly, meteoric fluid models are shown to be untenable because they are based on H and O isotope data largely derived from extraction of measured components from mixed primary and secondary fluid inclusions.The models (Fig. 2a) shown to be less-viable by Goldfarb and Groves (2015) include early syngenetic-exhalative models which are inconsistent with field evidence that shows the deposits are structurally-controlled, syn-to late-metamorphic deposits with stratiform to stratabound BIF-hosted deposits formed by sulfidation of magnetite (Phillips et al., 1984).

        <p>Early 20th century magmatic-hydrothermal models were reemphasized for orogenic gold deposits by a number of authors (Fig. 2b). However, globally, granitic intrusions may be pre-, syn-or postgold in the same terranes, or even absent in some, for example in the Otago gold province of New Zealand and in the Yukon. Where robust geochronological studies have been conducted, the gold deposits and proposed fertile granitic intrusions are not the same age, as summarized by Goldfarb and Groves (2015). In addition, the proposed parent granitic rocks have no consistent composition or oxidation state within or between terranes in contrast to other gold-bearing deposits (e.g., reduced IRGDs; Baker, 2002: oxidized porphyry Cu-Au;Hedenquist and Lowenstern, 1994). In some cases, lamprophyres and other more mafic intrusions have a similar age to the gold deposits (Vielreicher et al., 2010), but are volumetrically too minor to have provided the large volumes of fluids required to form the gold deposits. Therefore, magmatic-hydrothermal processes cannot explain the genesis of individual deposits let alone provide a universal mineral system model for orogenic gold formation, as eloquently argued by Wyman et al. (2016).Early 20th century magmatic-hydrothermal models were reemphasized for orogenic gold deposits by a number of authors (Fig. 2b).

        <p>The exclusion of the above models leaves metamorphic models as the only viable possibilities if a universal or near-universal model is sought for the genesis of orogenic gold deposits.The exclusion of the above models leaves metamorphic models as the only viable possibilities if a universal or near-universal model is sought for the genesis of orogenic gold deposits.</p>
        <p>As Goldfarb and Groves (2015) argue, lateral secretion models (Boyle, 1979) are invalid due to the limited volume of metamorphic fluid and metals that could be generated together with the unlikely dominance of lateral flow. Models involving advection of mantle CO 2 through the lower crust to generate granulites and a CO 2 -rich pseudo-metamorphic fluid are invalidated by lack of universal associations between granulites and gold, too low CO 2 contents of fluid inclusions, and available carbon isotope data.As Goldfarb and Groves (2015) argue, lateral secretion models (Boyle, 1979) are invalid due to the limited volume of metamorphic fluid and metals that could be generated together with the unlikely dominance of lateral flow.

        <p>Such logical arguments have led to general acceptance of a model that promotes metamorphic devolatilization of largely supracrustal rocks within the continental mid crust under greenschist-to amphibolite-facies conditions. This model emphasises gross upwards advection of resultant metamorphic fluid and metals to the depositional site of orogenic gold mineralization at higher crustal levels (summarized by Goldfarb et al., 2005;Phillips and Powell, 2010;Tomkins, 2010;among many others). This crustal metamorphic model is the only one of those discussed above for mesozonal to epizonal (terminology of Gebre-Marium et al., 1995) Fig. 1. Critical elements of a mineral system, with emphasis on orogenic gold. Adapted from McCuaig and Hronsky (2014). orogenic gold deposits that potentially could provide a universal model to explain their extraordinary longevity throughout Earth history (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Its main strengths are that it requires no specific association with host rock units, as most are mineralized in gold provinces globally, nor with any specific intrusion type. It also complies with the broadly late-metamorphic and late-deformational timing of gold deposition for most deposits, and the stable and radiogenic isotope data that are internally ambiguous but collectively suggest long and complex continental fluid pathways (Ridley and Diamond, 2000). The typical low-salinity H 2 O-CO 2 (AE CH 4 , N 2 ) fluid is also that expected from metamorphic devolatilization of supracrustal rocks (Fyfe et al., 1978).Such logical arguments have led to general acceptance of a model that promotes metamorphic devolatilization of largely supracrustal rocks within the continental mid crust under greenschist-to amphibolite-facies conditions.

        <p>In such a metamorphic model, gold rich fluids would have to been derived from different source rocks at different times in Earth history (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015) within different tectonic terranes where anomalous heat flow and consequent regional metamorphism was caused by a variety of crustal-to mantle-related processes (Goldfarb et al., 1986).In such a metamorphic model, gold rich fluids would have to been derived from different source rocks at different times in Earth history (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015) within different tectonic terranes where anomalous heat flow and consequent regional metamorphism was caused by a variety of crustal-to mantle-related processes (Goldfarb et al., 1986).</p>
        <p>Despite such high variability, it is important to recognise that gold deposition globally appears to be broadly coincident with a short-duration change in far field stress. This resulted in a transition in deformation from compression to transpression, more rarely transtension, during accretion (Goldfarb et al., 1988) with concomitant uplift and lowering of lithostatic pressure (Groves et al., 1987;White et al., 2015).Despite such high variability, it is important to recognise that gold deposition globally appears to be broadly coincident with a short-duration change in far field stress.

        <p>Despite the obvious strengths of many aspects of the crustal metamorphic model, there are several weaknesses, most obviously for Precambrian deposits, but also for an increasing number of Phanerozoic deposits, particularly in China. These are outlined in detail by Groves et al. (2019) and are only briefly summarized here.Despite the obvious strengths of many aspects of the crustal metamorphic model, there are several weaknesses, most obviously for Precambrian deposits, but also for an increasing number of Phanerozoic deposits, particularly in China.

        <p>The most obvious, potentially insurmountable, problem for the crustal metamorphic model as applied to Precambrian, particularly Archean, terranes is the occurrence of a significant number of deposits world-wide in mid-to upper-amphibolite facies domains, as demonstrated by Kolb et al. (2015) among others. Importantly, these hypozonal deposits have alteration assemblages that formed under similar P-T conditions to the metamorphosed host rocks (Colvine et al., 1988;Knight et al., 1993;McCuaig et al., 1993;Neumayr et al., 1993;Bloem et al., 1994;Miller and Adams, 2013) with structural style varying in sympathy with the P-T conditions of alteration assemblages (Groves, 1993, Fig. 3). Hence, the fluid source must have been deeper than the 15 km (possibly up to 20 km) depth of deepest orogenic gold deposit formation, not from devolatilization during amphibolite-facies metamorphism as proposed in the crustal metamorphic model. Additional evidence for a deep source is also provided by lead isotope evidence from the giant Neoarchean Eastern Goldfields Province of the Yilgarn Craton gold province of Western Australia (Browning et al., 1987;McNaughton et al., 1993).The most obvious, potentially insurmountable, problem for the crustal metamorphic model as applied to Precambrian, particularly Archean, terranes is the occurrence of a significant number of deposits world-wide in mid-to upper-amphibolite facies domains, as demonstrated by Kolb et al.

        <p>Here, lead isotope ratios from the orogenic gold deposits reflect the age and composition of the basement rocks to the supracrustal greenstone belts, implicating a deep source for the auriferous ore fluids. In addition, it is also uncertain whether the dominantly mafic rocks of most Precambrian greenstone belts can be a source for all gold-related metals during their metamorphic devolatilization (Pitcairn et al., 2015).Here, lead isotope ratios from the orogenic gold deposits reflect the age and composition of the basement rocks to the supracrustal greenstone belts, implicating a deep source for the auriferous ore fluids.

        <p>Finally, recent research on multiple sulfur isotopic compositions of Neoarchean orogenic gold deposits in Western Australia (Fig. 4) demonstrates that neither local supracrustal rocks nor granitic intrusions can have supply the majority of sulfur for deposition of gold-related sulfides in the deposits. The data from Selvajara et al. ( 2017) and LaFlamme et al. (2018) show that the sulfur for the auriferous fluids was derived from a reservoir that was homogenized a depth and contained recycled MIF-S that was sourced from an Archean sediment reservoir other than that in the greenstone belts themselves: that is, a sub-crustal source.Finally, recent research on multiple sulfur isotopic compositions of Neoarchean orogenic gold deposits in Western Australia (Fig. 4) demonstrates that neither local supracrustal rocks nor granitic intrusions can have supply the majority of sulfur for deposition of gold-related sulfides in the deposits.

        <p>Phanerozoic orogenic gold deposits in general fit the crustal metamorphic model well in that the majority of significant mesozonal to epizonal deposits are recorded to be in greenschist-facies domains, mainly in turbidite sequences (Goldfarb et al., 2005). Pitcairn et al. (2006) demonstrate it is feasible to release significant Au, As, Bi, Sb, Te and W, the major ore elements, from such sequences during greenschistto amphibolite-facies metamorphism. However, there are exceptions as for Precambrian equivalents (Fig. 5).Phanerozoic orogenic gold deposits in general fit the crustal metamorphic model well in that the majority of significant mesozonal to epizonal deposits are recorded to be in greenschist-facies domains, mainly in turbidite sequences (Goldfarb et al., 2005).

        <p>For example, the late Carboniferous to early Permian (315-285 Ma) gold deposits of the Variscan belt in the Massif Central of France (Goldfarb et al., 2001) include hypozonal deposits in the amphibolite-facies domains of the Saligne (4 Moz gold) and St-Yreix (1.3 Moz gold) districts (Bouchot et al., 2005).For example, the late Carboniferous to early Permian (315-285 Ma) gold deposits of the Variscan belt in the Massif Central of France (Goldfarb et al., 2001) include hypozonal deposits in the amphibolite-facies domains of the Saligne (4 Moz gold) and St-Yreix (1.3 Moz gold) districts (Bouchot et al., 2005).</p>
        <p>Other exceptions include some ~370 Ma lode gold deposits hosted in turbidite sequences in the Paleozoic Meguma Group, Nova Scotia, Canada (Kontak et al., 1990;Ryan and Smith, 1998). Although most gold deposits are sited in greenschist-facies domains, several, including Beaver Dam and Cochrane Hill, are located in amphibolite-facies domains and are interpreted by Kontak et al. (1990) to be derived from a sub-crustal fluid source released during regional doming.Other exceptions include some ~370 Ma lode gold deposits hosted in turbidite sequences in the Paleozoic Meguma Group, Nova Scotia, Canada (Kontak et al., 1990;Ryan and Smith, 1998).

        <p>The recently recognized hypozonal orogenic gold deposit at Danba (Zhang et al., 2018) is located in a poorly-documented gold province on the north-western margin of the Yangtze Block, China (Fig. 5), which is dominated by a &gt;1000 km Mesozoic domal domain along the Longmenshan thrust nappe belt. It is clearly a hypozonal orogenic gold deposit hosted in a broadly strata-bound ductile-brittle shear zone with high-T proximal alteration assemblages of biotite-amphibole-plagioclase and ore assemblages dominated by pyrrhotite, but with a strong association between gold and bismuth tellurides.

        <p>In conjunction with the issues discussed above, recent interest and documentation of Chinese gold deposits, particularly those close to the margins of the North China and Yangtze Blocks, has effectively seen the demise of the crustal metamorphism as a universally viable process for generation of orogenic gold deposits.In conjunction with the issues discussed above, recent interest and documentation of Chinese gold deposits, particularly those close to the margins of the North China and Yangtze Blocks, has effectively seen the demise of the crustal metamorphism as a universally viable process for generation of orogenic gold deposits.</p>
        <p>The giant Jiaodong gold province (Fig. 5) in the eastern half of the North China Block (Deng et al., 2003;L. Li et al., 2015;N. Li et al., 2015aN. Li et al., , 2015b;;Song et al., 2015;Yang et al., 2015Yang et al., , 2016;;Yang andSantosh, 2015, 2020) has been the major game changer in the search for a universal model. It represents a region of major lithospheric erosion of originally thick buoyant Archean SCLM (Griffin et al., 1998;Santosh, 2010aSantosh, , 2010b)), caused by anomalously complex Mesozoic slab subduction pene-contemporaneously from the north, south, and east. This led to slab devolatilization, consequent melting, and associated voluminous granitic magmatism (Windley et al., 2010). The associated Yanshanian Fig. 3.

Pyrite dominates in low metamorphic grade domains whereas pyrrhotite and loellingite dominate in higher metamorphic grade domains. Simplified from Groves (1993). (Jurassic-Cretaceous) orogeny, that occurred within the de-cratonized North China Block, was typified by basement uplift, regional extension, ca. 165-90 Ma granite intrusion, and ca. 120 Ma gold formation (Zhang et al., 2020) within the eastern margins of this highly modified cratonic basement (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014;Yang and Santosh, 2014). The timing of gold mineralization (Zhang et al., 2020) argues against a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid model, and the Precambrian high-grade metamorphism of the basement rocks clearly invalidates a crustal metamorphic-devolatilization model for the gold event. Despite this, the widespread gold episode correlates with changing far-field stresses and plate reorganizations and the Jiaodong deposits have generally been classified as orogenic gold deposits (Wang et al., 1998;Goldfarb et al., 2001Goldfarb et al., , 2005;;Yang et al., 2015aYang et al., , 2016a)). They show a clear structural control along regional faults (Deng et al., 2018(Deng et al., , 2019)), and ore and wallrock-alteration mineralogy, fluid inclusion compositions and stable isotope chemistry are similar to more typical orogenic gold deposits, particularly of epizonal type (Yang et al., 2015(Yang et al., , 2016)).The giant Jiaodong gold province (Fig. 5) in the eastern half of the North China Block (Deng et al., 2003;L.

        <p>Other Chinese gold deposits on the margins of the North China and Yangtze Blocks present similar, although more subtle, problems. For example, Goldfarb and Groves (2015) indicate significant timing problems for a crustal metamorphic model to form the mesozonal to epizonal orogenic gold deposits in the potentially giant Triassic Qinling gold province (Chen et al., 2008). This region marks the closure of the northernmost paleo-Tethys sea and the tectonic suturing of the Yangtze and North China Blocks (L. Li et al., 2015;N. Li et al., 2015a, b;Dong and Santosh, 2016). Recent research on the large Yangshan, Mian-Lue-Ning and Manaoke orogenic gold districts in the province (Li et al., 2018) confirm that, at the time of regional metamorphism, there were no previously un-metamorphosed voluminous source rocks that could have experienced fluid and metal liberation during amphibolite facies metamorphism, implicating an external deeply-sourced fluid.Other Chinese gold deposits on the margins of the North China and Yangtze Blocks present similar, although more subtle, problems.

        <p>The Huangjindong goldfield, hosted in Neoproterozoic slate, formed in a transpressional regime with deposits linked to the crustal-scale Chang-Ping Fault in the Jiangnan Orogen, Hunan Province, China. The mesozonal orogenic gold deposits are dominated by structurallycontrolled auriferous arsenopyrite-pyrite-quartz-(scheelite) veins and quartz-rich breccias that overprint earlier barren quartz veins (Zhang et al., 2019a). Geological and isotopic data indicate that the ore-forming components had a metamorphic source. Importantly, however, the host Neoproterozoic slate exposed over the entire province has only undergone greenschist-facies metamorphism, and so cannot be an effective, dominant source of crustal metamorphic ore fluid or metal (Zhang et al., 2018), again implicating a deeper, external source.The Huangjindong goldfield, hosted in Neoproterozoic slate, formed in a transpressional regime with deposits linked to the crustal-scale Chang-Ping Fault in the Jiangnan Orogen, Hunan Province, China.

Paleomagnetic data from mineralized rocks indicate a very late timing of gold mineralization following termination of the dominant shearing and fault displacement at ca. 21 Ma, arguing against a crustal source of metamorphic ore-fluid (Gao et al., 2018). Integration of C-O and He-Ar isotope compositions from ore-related carbonates and pyrites, respectively, in the deposits indicate a fluid source with both mantle and crustal components, and timing incompatible with regional metamorphism, suggests a deep sub-crustal source for the Ailaoshan deposits (Wang et al., 2019).A series of Upper Oligocene and Lower Miocene orogenic gold deposits, including the mesozonal lode-type Daping and epizonal disseminated-style Chang'an, Zhenyuan and Jinchang gold deposits, are distributed along the western margin of the NNW-trending Ailaoshan shear zone between the South China and Indochina Blocks in southeastern Tibet (Deng and Wang, 2016).

        <p>From the discussion presented above and those developed by Wyman et al. (2016), there are an increasing number of orogenic gold deposits that cannot be derived from magmatic-hydrothermal or crustal metamorphic fluid sources. Hence, for a coherent model, the fertility parameter of the mineral system must be represented by a sub-crustal H₂O-CO₂ S-bearing fluid containing dissolved Au and associated metals such as Ag, As, Bi, Sb, Te and W. The question then arises as to the nature of the sub-crustal source. As discussed in detail by Goldfarb and Groves (2015), there are few unequivocal indications of this precise fluid or metal source from fluid inclusion, stable isotope or radiogenic isotope data. This is because most data do not represent the original fluid and metal source, but rather the modification of that source by reactions along the long crustal pathways traversed by the fluids as they migrate towards gold depositional sites (Ridley and Diamond, 2000). The only obvious universal constraints are that the original fluid was almost certainly near-neutral and reduced (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015), although S isotope ratios of ore-related sulfides can, in some instances, discriminate between alternative sources (Wang et al., 2019). Thus, the ultimate sub-crustal source of fluid and metals must largely be deduced, as discussed below, through logical interpretation of geological constraints based on factors such as geodynamic setting and tectonic timing.From the discussion presented above and those developed by Wyman et al.

        <p>To resolve this question, the nature of geodynamic setting, the second component of the mineral system (Fig. 1), must be addressed. It is widely accepted that orogenic gold deposits are inevitably formed in accretionary or, less commonly, collisional tectonic environments related to subduction (Goldfarb et al., 2001(Goldfarb et al., , 2005)), and not in other types of metamorphic belts, indicating that convergent margins are the critical dynamic setting. Such a geodynamic environment can explain the conjunction of apparent late-to post-metamorphic timing in host sequences precisely at the time that a change in far-field stresses promoted a change from compression, as represented by the structures and metamorphic fabrics in the host rocks, to transpression or transtension, as demonstrated by the geometry of the orogenic gold ore-bodies (Groves and Santosh, 2015). This implicates a fundamental relationship to a change in plate motion on the whole-Earth scale. As discussed by Seno and Kirby (2014), this might be brought about by the cessation of subduction, perhaps due to collision with a basement block, such as the Selwyn Block in the Victorian Goldfields of eastern Australia (Moresi et al., 2014), or stalling of the slab during subduction, particularly flat subduction (Wyman et al., 2008;Wyman and Kerrich, 2010). These tectonic processes could result in a change of stress regime as plates were reorganised with subsequent switchover from compression to transpression.To resolve this question, the nature of geodynamic setting, the second component of the mineral system (Fig. 1), must be addressed.

        <p>In this geodynamic setting, the only conceivable sub-crustal source of fluid and metals is subducted oceanic crust and an overlying sediment wedge (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014;Goldfarb and Groves, 2015;Groves and Santosh, 2016;Wyman et al., 2016). Devolatilization of a subducted slab can result in extensive upward fluid-flux along slab-mantle boundaries (Sibson, 2004;Peacock et al., 2011;Katayama et al., 2012) into fore-arc or accreting terrane margins. At this stage, the oceanic slab will devolatilize, together with its overlying pyrite-bearing oceanic sediment wedge. The latter is important because gold and related elements such as Ag, As, Bi, Sb and Te can be released to the fluid via breakdown of sedimentary pyrite to pyrrhotite (Large et al., 2009(Large et al., , 2011;;Steadman et al., 2013). Such fluids can be then transported from the mantle to crustal levels in lithosphere-to crustal-scale fault zones as shown by radiogenic isotope, halogen and noble gas data from the San Andreas Fault system (Kennedy and van Soest, 2007;Pili et al., 2011) and the Karakorum Fault zone (Klemperer et al., 2013).In this geodynamic setting, the only conceivable sub-crustal source of fluid and metals is subducted oceanic crust and an overlying sediment wedge (Goldfarb and Santosh, 2014;Goldfarb and Groves, 2015;Groves and Santosh, 2016;Wyman et al., 2016).

A schematic model, adapted from the Goldfarb and Santosh (2014) and Groves et al.

        <p>This model can also elegantly explain the sympathetic relationship between the S isotope compositions of gold-related sulfides and the S isotope composition of seawater sulfate at the period of formation of most gold deposits (Fig. 7). This is because sediments transported down the subduction zone would have been derived via reduction of seawater sulfate. In addition, the richness of Neoarchean orogenic gold deposits could at least be partly explained by the occurrence of the most goldenriched sedimentary/diagenetic pyrites at this time in Earth history (Large et al., 2014). The higher CO 2 content of the Archean ore fluids could also be explained by a greater degree of carbonation in Archean oceanic rocks due to a combination of more-susceptible high-MgO basalts and lack of CO 2 sinks (Groves and Santosh, 2016: fig. 4).This model can also elegantly explain the sympathetic relationship between the S isotope compositions of gold-related sulfides and the S isotope composition of seawater sulfate at the period of formation of most gold deposits (Fig. 7).

        <p>Several of the Chinese orogenic gold provinces are sited on the margins of, or adjacent to, the continental North China and Yangtze Blocks. In their geodynamic model for the well-documented Jiaodong deposits, Goldfarb and Santosh (2014) suggested that the auriferous fluids could be either derived directly from the subduction zone, as implied in Fig. 6, or indirectly from the mantle lithosphere wedge that had been fertilized and metasomatized by fluids derived from that subduction zone. Subsequent geochemical and isotopic syntheses by Deng et al. (2019) have not only supported the latter model but shown, particularly on the basis of discrepant Neoproterozoic S isotope compositions of gold-related sulfides, that mantle-lithosphere metasomatism was related to a much earlier subduction event.Several of the Chinese orogenic gold provinces are sited on the margins of, or adjacent to, the continental North China and Yangtze Blocks.

        <p>As discussed above, the timing of generation of gold mineralization for the Danba hypozonal orogenic gold deposit (Zhang et al., 2018) and for the Ailaoshan mesozonal to epizonal orogenic gold belt (Wang et al., 2019) is incompatible with direct derivation from devolatilization of subduction-related sediment wedges. The belts hosting both groups of deposits are anomalous in terms of their tectonic history and zones of metamorphic core complexes, suggesting anomalous crustal heating and extension. In both cases, there is evidence of underlying mantle-lithosphere that was metasomatized during devolatilization related to an earlier subduction event (Zhou et al., 2002;Zhao and Zhou, 2008). As for the Jiaodong deposits, this has now been confirmed for Danba from geochemical and isotopic data on the gold ores, particularly the S isotope compositions that are incompatible with derivation from sedimentary sulfides subducted at the time of gold mineralization (Wang et al., 2019). Gold enrichment is also confirmed by studies of mantle xenoliths which show enrichment up to three times greater than elsewhere for mantle lithosphere beneath the North China Craton (Saunders et al., 2018). The only viable model for ore-fluid generation is devolatilization of this metasomatized mantle lithosphere by thermal anomalies channelled towards craton or other lithosphere margins (Begg et al., 2009), with subsequent advection up crustal-scale faults adjacent to the gold districts, as shown schematically in models in Deng et al.

        <p>The mechanisms for migration into the crust by such anomalous fluids created through devolatilization of metasomatized mantle lithosphere have been rarely addressed (Kennedy et al., 1997;Burnard and Polya, 2004;Finlay et al., 2010;Klemperer et al., 2013), with seismic pumping along crustal-scale faults as one logical mechanism (Cox, 2016). Rapid passage of such deeply-sourced ore fluid through faults with zones of local water saturation may be the mechanism to prevent the ore fluids from being consumed through partial melting to produce magmas in a more normal scenario (Schrauder and Navon, 1994;Bureau and Keppler, 1999;Klein-BenDavid et al., 2011;Rospab e et al., 2017).The mechanisms for migration into the crust by such anomalous fluids created through devolatilization of metasomatized mantle lithosphere have been rarely addressed (Kennedy et al., 1997;Burnard and Polya, 2004;Finlay et al., 2010;Klemperer et al., 2013), with seismic pumping along crustal-scale faults as one logical mechanism (Cox, 2016).

In agreement, most authors (see summaries in Groves et al., 2000;Goldfarb et al., 2005;Robert et al., 2005), agree that the first-order control on world-class orogenic gold districts is their location adjacent to crustal-to lithospheric-scale fault or shear zones at the province scale (Fig. 2). These structures are commonly marked by anomalous concentrations of lithosphere-sourced lamprophyre dykes or felsic-intermediate intrusions with mantle source components (Witt et al., 2013) that indicate a deep lithospheric connection for fluid conduits (Perring et al., 1987;Rock et al., 1989). The first-order faults are most highly endowed where they are intersected by high-angle accommodation structures (Hronsky et al., 2012;Goldfarb and Groves, 2015;Groves et al., 2016;Groves and Santosh, 2016;Wyman et al., 2016 and earlier references within). Less-endowed orogenic gold provinces (e.g., Zimbabwe gold provinces; Klondike province; Seward Peninsula of Alaska) lack these first-order structures and associated lamprophyres.For the mineral system orogenic-gold model(s) defined above, a favourable whole-lithospheric architecture is required, particularly to allow for focused propagation of auriferous fluids to the surface (McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014).

        <p>The distribution of gold mineralization proximal to major lithosphere-scale conduits is predominantly controlled by second-order, belt-scale structures that act to focus fluid flow. These generally propagate along lines of weakness, such as pre-existing reactivated thrust faults or contacts between lithological units with high competency contrasts. Mineralization at the deposit scale is focussed by third-order, physical throttles and host rocks that act as physical and chemical traps to promote the precipitation of minerals from auriferous fluids (Joly et al., 2010;McCuaig et al., 2010;McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014;Hagemann et al., 2016). Common structural traps include tight, faulted antiforms, intersections between strike-extensive shear zones and high-angle fault corridors, commonly at jogs in the former, irregular sheared margins of small granite or other intrusions and triple-point junctions between adjacent intrusions (Groves et al., 2018). Important chemical traps include fractured iron-rich host rocks and carbonaceous sedimentary units (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015).The distribution of gold mineralization proximal to major lithosphere-scale conduits is predominantly controlled by second-order, belt-scale structures that act to focus fluid flow.

        <p>There is also the requirement for a cap on the hydrothermal system to effectively impound fluid flux within the permeable trap zone. For Archean and Paleoproterozoic orogenic gold systems in particular, this is normally provided by relatively impermeable metasedimentary sequences that overlie more-permeable fractured volcanic sequences in greenstone belts (Groves et al., 2003). For younger systems, the controls may be more subtle variations in the thickness and/or rock strength of turbidite sequences, or thrusts that emplace less permeable sequences over trap rocks, as for example in Nevada for Carlin-type deposits (Cline et al., 2005).There is also the requirement for a cap on the hydrothermal system to effectively impound fluid flux within the permeable trap zone.

        <p>The critical components of the mineral-system orogenic-gold model (Fig. 1) are discussed in logical order from Geodynamics to Fertility to Architecture to Preservation and summarized in a series of tables. For the orogenic model, Fertility is intimately linked to Geodynamics, so these are grouped together in Table 1. The geodynamic setting can be identified by critical parameters, most of which, in practise, can only be recognized via geological proxies and geophysical responses. Architecture can be viewed pragmatically at province and district to deposit scales, as shown on Tables 2 and3, respectively.

        <p>As discussed above, the critical fertility factor is related to the subduction of an oceanic slab and overlying sediment wedge that can provide fluid, sulfur, gold and other ore metals to the orogenic gold system (Figs. 6 and8). As subduction is effectively linked to convergent margin geodynamic settings, these must be identified as crucial terranes or provinces within which to target gold exploration. A caveat is that Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic terranes are likely to be poorly endowed relative to all other periods of Earth history. Many convergent margin terranes will have their fertility marked by significant gold occurrences as gold prospecting has been a global occupation for centuries. However, a consistent assessment of past convergent margin settings may open up new exploration spaces in more remote regions.As discussed above, the critical fertility factor is related to the subduction of an oceanic slab and overlying sediment wedge that can provide fluid, sulfur, gold and other ore metals to the orogenic gold system (Figs. 6 and8).

        <p>In this context, it is useful to consider the modern concepts on convergent margins and related processes, particularly since oceanic subduction along convergent margins is the major site of building and recycling continental crust (Stern, 2011;Straub and Zhellmer, 2012). Convergent margin processes exert a significant control over the nature and style of metallogeny (Groves et al., 2019). The evolution and preservation of continents and their mineral resources through time are largely controlled by the processes of creation and destruction of continental crust in subduction zones. Tectonic erosion along convergent margins by down-going oceanic plates, including arc subduction and sediment subduction, results in the destruction of continental crust, erosion of craton roots, and modification of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle, thus significantly influencing the geochemical cycle of the Earth in general (Yamamoto et al., 2009;Vannucchi et al., 2016). Deep subducted material accumulates at the mantle transition zone or over the core-mantle boundary which is recycled and incorporated into rising plumes, representing major pipes that transfer elements and volatiles to higher levels in the crust (Santosh et al., 2009). The magmatic, metamorphic and metasomatic 'factories' operating in subduction zones provide potential and diverse pathways for element transfer (Maruyama et al., 2009), building deep-seated archives of metals which contribute to the formation of major mineral deposits (Yang and Santosh, 2020).In this context, it is useful to consider the modern concepts on convergent margins and related processes, particularly since oceanic subduction along convergent margins is the major site of building and recycling continental crust (Stern, 2011;Straub and Zhellmer, 2012).

        <p>Convergent margin tectonics is considered to be responsible for building the major global types of orogenic belts that are termed accretionary and collisional orogens (also known as Pacific-type and Himalayan-type; Maruyama et al., 1996;Cawood et al., 2009;Santosh et al., 2009). The major components resulting from the two types of orogeny are distinct. The hallmark of accretionary-type orogeny is an accretionary complex comprising oceanic materials such as MORB, seamounts, Ocean Island Basalt (OIB), carbonates and deep-sea sediments. Commonly, an extensive batholith belt forms on the continental side and fore-arc basins are formed in between. In collisional-type orogens, passive continental-margin sequences dominate, with the orogenic core composed of regional metamorphic belts, and a collisional suture zone which preserves the remnants of oceanic rock sequences. Accretionary orogens have been further grouped into retreating and advancing types (Cawood et al., 2009). The modern western Pacific provides an example of a retreating orogen with a characteristic back-arc basin, whereas the Andes with its foreland fold and thrust belt, with crustal thickening, is considered to be an advancing orogen. Accretionary orogens mark the major sites of consumption and reworking of continental crust, and are therefore important in understanding the evolution of continental crust and its resources. Since collisional orogens are the end product of accretionary orogeny, involving extensive subduction of oceanic lithosphere, the Himalayan-type collisional orogens also commonly incorporate the imprints of accretionary-type sequences. One of the best examples of a protracted history of subduction and accretion leading to final collision is provided by the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, considered as the world's largest Phanerozoic accretionary orogen, where diverse types of precious-and base-metal mineral deposits and major metallogenic belts were created during the multiple subduction-accretion-collision cycle (Goldfarb et al., 2014;Xiao et al., 2015).Convergent margin tectonics is considered to be responsible for building the major global types of orogenic belts that are termed accretionary and collisional orogens (also known as Pacific-type and Himalayan-type; Maruyama et al., 1996;Cawood et al., 2009;Santosh et al., 2009).

        <p>One of the useful geological tools to distinguish extinct convergent margins from surface geology is the recognition of Ocean Plate Stratigraphy (OPS). The OPS has been defined as the original composite stratigraphic succession of the ocean floor which is incorporated in an accretionary complex and can be considered as the travelogue of an oceanic plate from mid oceanic ridge to subduction zone (Matsuda and Isozaki, 1991;Safonova et al., 2009;Santosh, 2010aSantosh, , 2010b)). A typical OPS sequence, accreted on to land, would thus be a sequence of MORB, chert, OIB and trench sediment (Isozaki et al., 2010). Identification of OPS has been also described from Precambrian terranes in recent studies (Kawai et al., 2009), including evidence from major suture zones associated with the assembly of Proterozoic supercontinents (Santosh et al., 2009).

Archean and Paleozoic convergent margins comprise more mafic-ultramafic sequences, resulting in the common terminology of greenstone belts, but arc-type volcanic rocks and turbidites are also present (Kawai et al., 2009). The high thermal flux in these settings is represented by voluminous granite batholiths and plutons, which dominate the preserved Archean and Paleoproterozoic convergent margin terranes. In a classic preserved sequence, these range from M-through I-to S-and A-type granites from the oceanic to continental margins of the convergent margins (L. Li et al., 2015;N.

        <p>From a geophysical viewpoint, these terranes are normally marked by quite subtle aeromagnetic and gravity signatures that are commonly dominated by contrasts with less-or more-magnetic and lower-gravity granite intrusions. In Fig. 10, the granite-greenstone terrane of the Yilgarn Block shows such a regional gravity pattern. The figure also clearly shows the craton-scale architecture of which the Yilgarn Block is part. It is only where there are Fe-rich lithostratigraphic units such as BIF units (Precambrian) or Fe-rich sills, at metamorphic-facies boundaries, or major boundaries between suspect terranes that there are strong magnetic contrasts within the supracrustal sequences. The major terranebounding faults or shear zones are normally clearly defined as lineaments on combined gravity-aeromagnetic images (Fig. 11). In terranes with superior pre-competitive geophysical data, that is available publicly from government sources, regional gravity surveys can better define the crustal architecture and highlight the deeper structures using multiscale edge analysis of potential field data or "worming" (Archibald et al., 1999).

        <p>Where the convergent margin assemblages have undergone collisional tectonics or other tectonic interaction with craton or other lithosphere margins, the geological proxies are more complicated. There are commonly shelf-facies with carbonate units together with sandstone and shale sequences that overlie the more typical convergent margin assemblages (Fig. 9). There may be high metamorphic -grade basement juxtaposed against lower metamorphic-grade supracrustal sequences, commonly with complex fold-thrust interactions, and metamorphic core complexes developed in extreme cases (Zhang et al., 2018). The critical presence of metasomatized mantle lithosphere is indirectly detected by an anomalous abundance of hybrid (mixed mantle-crust derived) mafic to felsic intrusions (Mair et al., 2011), or directly detected by metasomatized mantle xenoliths within alkaline intrusions (Saunders et al., 2018). From a geophysical viewpoint, a combination of gravity, seismic and magneto-telluric data provide 2D to 3D representations of the complex structural geometry over the fragmented craton margin, but it is the aeromagnetic lineaments that normally best define the critical permeable fault zones up which sub-crustal auriferous fluids can migrate upwards into the crust as other geophysical data are commonly absent.Where the convergent margin assemblages have undergone collisional tectonics or other tectonic interaction with craton or other lithosphere margins, the geological proxies are more complicated.

        <p>At the province or terrane scale (Table 2), the architecture parameter of the mineral system model is closely linked to the geodynamics and fertility factors. The key architecture factor at this scale is provision of major permeable structures that extend to the Moho and can deliver high thermal and seismically-driven fluid flux from lithosphere to the crust (Fig. 8). As discussed above, for well-endowed gold provinces these are the first-order faults and shear zones that are marked by distinct aeromagnetic lineaments and commonly control the distribution of lamprophyres and related intrusions. Although seismic reflection sections are commonly used to portray the extent of these faults with depth, the faults are normally interpreted as shallowing thrusts (Owen et al., 1991: fig. 12), contrary to geological observations of these faults at varying depths along strike. It is the magneto-telluric sections (Dentith et al., 2013) that most clearly mark the vertical extent of these lineaments (Fig. 13). They conform to geological constraints that the aeromagnetic lineaments parallel or cross-cut metamorphic domain boundaries without deflection and all first-order structures from sub-greenschist-facies to upper-amphibolite-facies domains (&lt;3 km to &gt;15 km crustal depth) are steeply-dipping, as in the case of the Yilgarn Block of Western Australia.At the province or terrane scale (Table 2), the architecture parameter of the mineral system model is closely linked to the geodynamics and fertility factors.

        <p>Terranes with low-strain low-permeability sequences, indicated by preservation of primary structures and textures, with widely-spaced high-strain high-permeability shear zones provide greater opportunity for formation of world-class to giant mineral systems. This is because high fluid flux is focussed into a relatively small volume within the terrane, and is a major reason why Precambrian greenstone belts are so well endowed with orogenic gold (Groves et al., 2000). These first-order structures may also be marked by multi-element geochemical anomalism, as for example from geochemical surveys of laterites in the largely covered greenstone terranes of the Yilgarn Block in Western Australia (Butt and Zeegers, 1992).Terranes with low-strain low-permeability sequences, indicated by preservation of primary structures and textures, with widely-spaced high-strain high-permeability shear zones provide greater opportunity for formation of world-class to giant mineral systems.

        <p>More rapid uplift pene-contemporaneous with gold mineralization may also be an important regional factor. Giant gold districts, particularly Neoarchean examples, are commonly in districts where late conglomerate basins are juxtaposed against lower volcanic sequences (Abitibi Belt, Canada: Colvine et al., 1984;Norseman-Wiluna Belt, Western Australia: Tripp, 2014), with marked contrasts in magnetic intensity. Regional geophysical data for the western Capricorn Orogen with 2.5 km bouguer anomaly gravity data (colour) draped over 300-500 m line-spaced TMI aeromagnetic data (black and white). The location of the structural-metamorphic zone boundaries of the Gascoyne Province, major fault and mineral deposits is also shown. From Johnson et al.

        <p>These are interpreted to signify sites of anomalously rapid uplift rates along the first-order structures. Such rapid uplift lowers lithostatic pressures in interconnecting faults enhancing hydro-fracturing, inducing extreme pressure fluctuations, and leading to effective gold deposition through fluid un-mixing episodes (Groves et al., 1987). The same appears to hold for younger terranes in southern Alaska, where gold deposition is interpreted to have occurred on the retrograde limb of a clockwise Barrovian metamorphic P-T path as host rocks were rapidly uplifted (Goldfarb et al., 1986).These are interpreted to signify sites of anomalously rapid uplift rates along the first-order structures.

        <p>Those repetitive structural geometries that control the location of many orogenic gold deposits are described and discussed in considerable detail by Groves et al. (2018). They are briefly summarized below with reference to Table 3 and Fig. 14 and more extensive figures in Groves et al. (2018) where appropriate, with more emphasis here on the geological, geophysical and/or geochemical responses to critical geological parameters that have exploration significance. Where crustal-to lithospheric-scale faults and shear zones are very linear with essentially the mean regional strike, they have no major damage zones and are consequently poorly gold-endowed. It is only along the curvilinear segments or jogs on these first-order structures that are 10 -25 off the mean trend (Groves et al., 2018: figs. 2 and 3), that the larger orogenic gold districts such as Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and Muruntau in Uzbekistan are sited (Weinberg et al., 2004). These districts are commonly spaced at intervals of ~30-35 km, broadly equivalent to depth to Moho, particularly where they host world-class deposits (Doutre, 2019, personal communication). It is also significant that some jogs, such as at Kalgoorlie (Weinberg et al., 2004) coincide with large-scale anticlinal structures, one of the most robust associations with orogenic gold, as discussed below.Those repetitive structural geometries that control the location of many orogenic gold deposits are described and discussed in considerable detail by Groves et al.

        <p>At the district to deposit scale, orogenic gold deposits that are sited adjacent to these jogs may be hosted by a variety of faults or shear zones that pre-date gold mineralization: D₁ and D₂, less commonly D₃, structures as evident in most published D₁ to D₄ structural sequences (Vielreicher et al., 2016). However, subparallel arrays of obliquely cross-cutting faults that develop where there are flexures or jogs on the first-order faults, in many instances, provide the most important structural geometries in terms of predictive exploration (Groves et al., 2000(Groves et al., , 2018: figs. 4-6): figs. 4-6). Worldwide, such accommodation fault arrays tend to be at ~70 to the local trend of the first-order structures and rock sequences, and are readily interpreted from arrays of aeromagnetic linear features oblique to the major aeromagnetic lineaments, with no mutual displacement. Groves et al. (2018) provide a variety of lines of evidence that these fault arrays control the location of gold deposits rather than post-date them, as suggested, for example at Kalgoorlie by Boulter et al. (1987), Mueller et al. (1988), Bateman and Hagemann (2004) and Weinberg et al. (2006). In many cases, the gold deposits are located in pre-gold structures between two of these accommodation faults that have the same sense of motion. Examples from Western Australia include Mt Charlotte and the Golden Mile at Kalgoorlie and Kundana (Groves et al., 2018: figs. 4 and 5) and from China include Huangjindong (Zhang et al., 2018(Zhang et al., , 2019a)).At the district to deposit scale, orogenic gold deposits that are sited adjacent to these jogs may be hosted by a variety of faults or shear zones that pre-date gold mineralization: D₁ and D₂, less commonly D₃, structures as evident in most published D₁ to D₄ structural sequences (Vielreicher et al., 2016).

        <p>Insights into the structural mechanisms that lead to such controls can be gained from research in non-mineralized terranes in California (Nicholson et al., 1986;Jackson and Molnar, 1990) and in Alaska (Page et al., 1995). These studies describe rotation and torsional strain within the blocks between pairs of kinematically-compatible faults with the same sense of movement (Groves et al., 2018: fig. 7). This rotation of fault blocks and their internal pre-existing structures, due to the opposite fault motion on either side of the bounding paired faults, causes reactivation of, and inhomogeneous strain within, those internal structures. This leads to focussed fluid flux into dilation and other damage zones along suitably-aligned pre-existing structures and deposition of high-grade gold ores within those structures and more disseminated mineralization and alteration zones adjacent to them. There may be distinctive multi-element geochemical anomalies (Au, As, Sb, Te, and W) and distinct changes in the hyperspectral signature of alteration micas (Wang et al., 2017) at these intersection points.Insights into the structural mechanisms that lead to such controls can be gained from research in non-mineralized terranes in California (Nicholson et al., 1986;Jackson and Molnar, 1990) and in Alaska (Page et al., 1995).

        <p>Many authors have designated anticlines, or antiforms, the most robust fluid traps for orogenic gold deposits at the district to deposit scale (Goldfarb et al., 2005). Cox et al. (1991) showed that turbidite-hosted deposits now termed orogenic gold deposits formed when folds became 'locked up', with faulting and fracturing replacing flexural folding as the predominant deformation mechanism. The locked-up folds tend to be asymmetrical folds with apical angles of approximately 30 and overturned back limbs, modified by thrusts and fracture arrays that promote focussed fluid flux and resultant gold deposition (Leader et al., 2010). As shown by Groves et al. (2018: fig. 8b-h), these fold characteristics are common to a wide range of orogenic gold deposits of different age and host sequences globally.Many authors have designated anticlines, or antiforms, the most robust fluid traps for orogenic gold deposits at the district to deposit scale (Goldfarb et al., 2005).

        <p>It is evident that district-to deposit-scale anticlinal or antiformal folds with ~30 apical angles, commonly with associated thrusts, are a predictable and repetitive characteristic of many orogenic gold deposits of all ages. They have highly variable geophysical signatures (Table 3) dependant on their host sequences. Related thrust or oblique-slip duplexes may be detected via complex aeromagnetic signatures and gravity gradients. The two giant Archean orogenic gold deposits at the Golden Mile, Kalgoorlie and Timmins, Abitibi Belt, formed within complex, duplicated (Golden Mile) antiformal structures due to folding of preexisting thrust faults (Groves et al., 2000: fig. 5).It is evident that district-to deposit-scale anticlinal or antiformal folds with ~30 apical angles, commonly with associated thrusts, are a predictable and repetitive characteristic of many orogenic gold deposits of all ages.

        <p>The important exploration aspects of the mineral system architecture parameter discussed above deal exclusively with structures confined to the convergent margin volcano-sedimentary sequences in orogenic gold provinces. Granite intrusions are a common component in orogenic gold provinces as a reflection of high thermal gradients related to subductionrelated orogenesis (Goldfarb et al., 2005). They may be pre-gold, relatively rare syn-gold, or post-gold intrusions, with no consistent spatial or genetic relationship to the orogenic gold deposits (Goldfarb and Groves, 2015). However, in some gold provinces, particularly in Archean and Paleoproterozoic granite-dominated terranes, pre-to syn-gold intrusions may play an important structural role for the location of both gold districts or camps and individual gold deposits. This is discussed below, with emphasis on the district scale.The important exploration aspects of the mineral system architecture parameter discussed above deal exclusively with structures confined to the convergent margin volcano-sedimentary sequences in orogenic gold provinces.

        <p>As shown somewhat schematically in Fig. 14c andd, individual rigid granitic intrusions, whether having sheared or complex intrusive contacts with volcano-sedimentary sequences, can cause significant variations in the orientation of local principal maximum stress relative to the externally-imposed regional stress. These may cause anomalously-low minimum stress zones on a deposit scale related to variations in the geometry of the immediate contact zones (Granny Smith in Western Australia: Ojala et al., 1993) or on a district scale related to complexities in the regional geometry of the intrusion contact (Coolgardie Goldfield, Western Australia: Knight et al., 1993). These low minimum-stress zones can localise fluid flux and become the loci of gold mineralization (Ridley, 1993).As shown somewhat schematically in Fig. 14c andd, individual rigid granitic intrusions, whether having sheared or complex intrusive contacts with volcano-sedimentary sequences, can cause significant variations in the orientation of local principal maximum stress relative to the externally-imposed regional stress.

In these settings, significant gold deposits are normally located in thrust or oblique-slip duplexes within V-shaped neck zones that represent strain gradients between the compressional high-strain zone of thinning between the adjacent granite intrusions and the low strain supracrustal sequences distal to the intrusions. Fluid flux is directed to these zones of heterogeneous stress with gold deposits deposited in structural sites within them.Complexities in structural geometry compound where two or more adjacent rigid granite intrusions impinge on more ductile volcanosedimentary sequences, as in the Barberton Goldfield of South Africa (Groves et al., 2018: fig. 10).

        <p>More complex structural geometries are developed at triple-point junctions between three granitic bodies that impinge on the volcanosedimentary sequences.

        <p>From an exploration viewpoint, these triple-and even quadruplepoint junctions are evident on available aeromagnetic images (Fig. 15) and are commonly on gravity gradients due to magnetic susceptibility and density contrasts between granite intrusions and supracrustal sequences, particularly in Precambrian greenstone belts.From an exploration viewpoint, these triple-and even quadruplepoint junctions are evident on available aeromagnetic images (Fig. 15) and are commonly on gravity gradients due to magnetic susceptibility and density contrasts between granite intrusions and supracrustal sequences, particularly in Precambrian greenstone belts.</p>
        <p>As discussed in more detail by Groves et al. (2018), such triple point junctions have also been identified as potential sites for gold mineralization on a geodynamic scale in recent studies such as those in the North China Craton. For example, Li and Santosh (2017) identified that most of the major gold deposits, including the giant Jiaodong gold province, associated with the Mesozoic giant metallogenic provinces in the North China Craton are located along the zones of amalgamation of two or three paleo micro-blocks, making such zones important targets for terrane-scale exploration.As discussed in more detail by Groves et al.

        <p>Structure clearly plays the major role in focussing large volumes of auriferous fluid into small volumes of rock and forming high-grade veintype gold deposits. However, the nature of the rock sequences plays the major role in the formation of bulk-tonnage lower-grade disseminated orebodies suitable for modern mining. As noted in Table 3, both rheology and geochemistry of the potential host rocks play a major role. There must be a favourable fluid pathway to the rheologically or geochemically prospective rocks (Hronsky, 2019).Structure clearly plays the major role in focussing large volumes of auriferous fluid into small volumes of rock and forming high-grade veintype gold deposits.

        <p>Rheological contrasts between rock types in the potential host sequences play an important role in selective failure of more competent units to provide specific permeability channels for fluid migration and fluid-rock reaction. Decreases from supralithostatic to hydrostatic pressure related to such hydraulic fracturing (Sibson, 1992;Cox et al., 2001) leads to fluid immiscibility and direct gold precipitation (Loucks and Mavrogenes, 1999). Fluid reaction with Fe-rich rocks such as BIFs, basalts, dolerites and diorites, that have high magnetic susceptibility, also leads to gold deposition via sulfidation reactions (Phillips et al., 1984;Bohlke, 1988) and other wallrock reactions (Evans et al., 2006). Carbonaceous material may play a role in fluid reduction and gold deposition in carbon-rich sedimentary host rocks (Wilson et al., 2013), which may be defined by IP or TEM anomalism. A schematic plot of rheology vs reactivity in Fig. 16 demonstrates how potential host rocks for orogenic gold deposits might be assessed with basic knowledge of litho-stratigraphic successions and igneous intrusions.Rheological contrasts between rock types in the potential host sequences play an important role in selective failure of more competent units to provide specific permeability channels for fluid migration and fluid-rock reaction.

        <p>It is also important that the auriferous fluid is impounded within the depositional site and not be able to readily exit the hydrothermal system. Such caps are normally provided by rheology contrasts between the gold system and overlying units. For Precambrian deposits, the cap is commonly provided by more ductile sedimentary units that overly more competent volcanic-dominated sequences (Groves et al., 2000), but the cap may be more subtle in Phanerozoic deposits in dominantly sedimentary sequences. There will inevitably be some fluid outflow potentially defined by anomalous but metal-poor carbonate-mica alteration zones that could appear as magnetic lows if destruction of Fe-rich minerals was involved in alteration.It is also important that the auriferous fluid is impounded within the depositional site and not be able to readily exit the hydrothermal system.

        <p>As noted above, orogenic gold systems are anomalous in that they can form at deep crustal levels and may individually extend to &gt; 2 km down dip or plunge, explaining their distribution throughout most of geologic time (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Whether they are exposed at or close to the surface depends on exhumation and erosion. The degree of exhumation for any terrane can be accurately deduced from thermo-chronological studies (Zhang et al., 2019b), However, from a more practical viewpoint, the geologically deduced level of erosion of known deposits can be a good exploration guide. As discussed above, the structural and alteration characteristics, combined with their metal associations, can be used to group them into epizonal, mesozonal and hypozonal groups (Gebre-Mariam et al., 1995). A terrane having mostly epizonal Au-Sb deposits, for example, clearly has the potential to host deeper mesozonal deposits, either beneath epizonal deposits, or elsewhere in the terrane. In contrast, a terrane dominated by hypozonal deposits has more limited future potential, although orebodies in the giant Kolar hypozonal deposit did extend for more than 2 km depth below surface (Radhakrishna and Curtis, 1999;Sarma et al., 2011).As noted above, orogenic gold systems are anomalous in that they can form at deep crustal levels and may individually extend to &gt; 2 km down dip or plunge, explaining their distribution throughout most of geologic time (Goldfarb et al., 2001).

        <p>Any mineral system has to be anchored by the fundamental Earth processes incorporated in geodynamics, fertility, architecture and preservation. For orogenic gold systems, fertility is inexorably linked to subduction, so that geodynamics and fertility parameters are both related to convergent margin tectonics. Fertile gold fluids are either directly related to devolatilization of the subducted slab and overlying sediment wedge, or indirectly related to reactivated mantle lithosphere previously metasomatized by such fertile subduction-related fluids. The first-order components of the orogenic gold system architecture are lithosphereto-crust-scale faults or shear zones capable of delivering a focussed flux of auriferous fluid to the crust during seismic activity, preferably to crustal levels equivalent to the ductile-brittle transition. Within the crust, fluid is further focussed into spaced damage zones, normally jogs or flexures in the first-order fluid channels via injection-driven swarm seismology. Here, the fluid migrates along pressure gradients to lowerorder, interconnected structures with repetitive architectures, related to critical controls such as fault arrays, locked-up anticlinal hinges, or anomalous configurations of igneous intrusions. Conjunctions of these parameters produce the world-class to giant deposits. At these structural sites, depositional traps and caps connected to favourable fluid pathways are controlled by rheology and geochemical contrasts between rock units in the host rock sequences. The deposits normally survive exhumation and erosion because of their deep crustal formation and extensive vertical extent, and, in the case of Precambrian deposits, the formation of thick buoyant lithosphere soon after gold mineralization. It is only the period from the Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic that is largely devoid or orogenic gold deposits.Any mineral system has to be anchored by the fundamental Earth processes incorporated in geodynamics, fertility, architecture and preservation.

        <p>From an exploration viewpoint, the orogenic gold system model provides a hierarchical framework for target generation. Ancient convergent margins can first be recognized from a number of geological and geophysical proxies outlined above. Strike-extensive faults that extend to the Moho can be best identified as aeromagnetic lineaments in poorly-explored terranes, or as magneto-telluric anomalous zones in more mature terranes. They may also have deeply-sourced intrusions, such as lamprophyre dykes along them. The wide range of structural and stratigraphic traps related to interconnected lower-order structures can be recognized by repetitive structural geometries derived from both geological and geophysical data. Gravity "worms" and gradients may be particularly diagnostic. Locations within these geometries that comprise rock sequences with the required rheological and geochemical characteristics to represent traps and caps can then be identified as specific exploration targets. These are likely to have a multi-element geochemical footprint if a significant deposit exists at the target site.From an exploration viewpoint, the orogenic gold system model provides a hierarchical framework for target generation.

Strike-extensive faults that extend to the Moho can be best identified as aeromagnetic lineaments in poorly-explored terranes, or as magneto-telluric anomalous zones in more mature terranes. They may also have deeply-sourced intrusions, such as lamprophyre dykes along them. The wide range of structural and stratigraphic traps related to interconnected lower-order structures can be recognized by repetitive structural geometries derived from both geological and geophysical data. Gravity "worms" and gradients may be particularly diagnostic. Locations within these geometries that comprise rock sequences with the required rheological and geochemical characteristics to represent traps and caps can then be identified as specific exploration targets. These are likely to have a multi-element geochemical footprint if a significant deposit exists at the target site.</p>
