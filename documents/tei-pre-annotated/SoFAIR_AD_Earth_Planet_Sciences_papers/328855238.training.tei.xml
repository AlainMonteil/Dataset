        <p>Information on land use and land cover (LULC) including forest cover is important for the development of strategies for land planning and management. Satellite remotely sensed data of varying resolutions have been an unmatched source of such information that can be used to produce estimates with a greater degree of confidence than traditional inventory estimates. However, use of these data has always been a challenge in tropical regions owing to the complexity of the biophysical environment, clouds, and haze, and atmospheric moisture content, all of which impede accurate LULC classification. We tested a parametric classifier (logistic regression) and three non-parametric machine learning classifiers (improved k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machine) for classification of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery into LULC categories in Dak Nong province, Vietnam. A total of 446 images, 235 from the year 2017 and 211 from the year 2018, were pre-processed to gain high quality images for mapping LULC in the 6516 km 2 study area. The Sentinel 2 images were tested and classified separately for four temporal periods: (i) dry season, (ii) rainy season, (iii) the entirety of the year 2017, and (iv) the combination of dry and rainy seasons. Eleven different LULC classes were discriminated of which five were forest classes. For each combination of temporal image set and classifier, a confusion matrix was constructed using independent reference data and pixel classifications, and the area on the ground of each class was estimated. For overall temporal periods and classifiers, overall accuracy ranged from 63.9% to 80.3%, and the Kappa coefficient ranged from 0.611 to 0.813. Area estimates for individual classes ranged from 70 km 2 (1% of the study area) to 2200 km 2 (34% of the study area) with greater uncertainties for smaller classes.Information on land use and land cover (LULC) including forest cover is important for the development of strategies for land planning and management.

        <p>Most Vietnamese forests are classified as tropical with natural forest accounting for more than 70% of the total forest area [1]. Dak Nong province has the most abundant natural forest resources in Vietnam. The great diversity of this resource is primarily owing to a wide variety of environmental and climatic factors, most of which are governed by latitude and topography [2]. However, Dak Nong's natural forests are being lost at an alarming rate owing to factors that include expanding agriculture, conversion to commercial and plantation forest types, and increasing human population. For many years, the Highland Plateau, which includes Dak Nong, has been a major "hot spot" for conversion of forest to agriculture in Vietnam. During the 1990s and early 2000s, forest was lost at an average annual rate of 15,000 ha per year [3], with forest cover declining from 75% in 1985 to 60% in 2009. During this time, the annual rate of deforestation in the Highland Plateau was the greatest of all regions, accounting for 46.3% of the entire national forest area lost.Most Vietnamese forests are classified as tropical with natural forest accounting for more than 70% of the total forest area [1].

        <p>The Highland Plateau is characterized by a complex topography with mountains, highlands, valleys, deltas, and diversified soil types. Approximately 1.3 million ha are fertile soils, rich in organic matter and nutrients, that facilitate development of high value industrial perennial crops such as coffee, rubber, pepper, cashew, and fruit trees. Additionally, the distinct rainy and dry seasons in the south of Vietnam cause differences in the rates of plant growth. Finally, climatic differences from north to south in Vietnam cause vegetation to vary in physiognomy and lead to morphological differences among land cover types, particularly between semi-evergreen and deciduous Dipterocarp forests.The Highland Plateau is characterized by a complex topography with mountains, highlands, valleys, deltas, and diversified soil types.

        <p>Current, accurate, and detailed land cover information that reflects these unique topographic and climatic conditions, particularly for natural forest types, is crucial for land managers, decision makers, and policy makers tasked with developing forest management strategies and policies [4][5][6]. Forest resource decision-making is characterized by a large degree of uncertainty regarding the outcomes of alternative choices. The result is a wide variety of opinions regarding the different options that impedes agreement on a clear way forward. Although there is usually agreement on general objectives such as sustainable forest use, biodiversity conservation, and the alleviation of rural poverty, conflicts among stakeholders over the best course of action for achieving these objectives almost always arise. New issues or new actors may appear and influence discussions, external events may unexpectedly require the revision of agreed policy proposals, and deadlocks can exist for long periods, all continuing until pressing circumstances lead to settlements and decisions [7].Current, accurate, and detailed land cover information that reflects these unique topographic and climatic conditions, particularly for natural forest types, is crucial for land managers, decision makers, and policy makers tasked with developing forest management strategies and policies [4][5][6].

        <p>Remote sensing offers a unique environmental capability for monitoring extensive geographical areas in a cost-efficient manner, while simultaneously producing information related to the Earth's land, atmosphere, and oceans [8]. Land cover mapping represents one of the most common uses of remotely sensed data [9][10][11], with satellite imagery serving as one of the most important data sources [11].Remote sensing offers a unique environmental capability for monitoring extensive geographical areas in a cost-efficient manner, while simultaneously producing information related to the Earth's land, atmosphere, and oceans [8].

        <p>As previously, Dak Nong presents unique challenges for the construction of accurate remote sensing-based land use land cover (LULC) maps [12]. The variation in vegetation owing to the rainy/dry seasonal variation affects the spectral reflectance properties of vegetation. For example, deciduous dipterocarp forests have spectral properties in the dry season that are similar to those of other cover types such as industrial coffee and rubber crops, whereas the respective spectral properties are quite different in the rainy season. Only a few studies have accommodated this kind of seasonal variation when constructing satellite image-based land cover classifications. Sothe et al. (2017) [13] combined multi-spectral fall and spring season images when mapping land cover with Landsat-8 data and found that the inclusion of additional band data considerably improved classifications when compared with the use of fall spectral bands alone. For both classifiers used by Sothe et al. (2017) [13], there were meaningful increases in classification accuracy, by 4.8% and 2.9% for the random forests and support vector machine classifiers, respectively, when the "spring" spectral bands were added. Dak Nong's seasonal growth variation, varying vegetation spectral signatures, and varying topography suggest that Sentinel-2 satellite spectral data, with its fine spatial resolution (10-60 m), fine temporal resolution (five days), and fine spectral resolution (13 spectral bands), may be particularly well-suited for land cover classification purposes in the province. Although data from the Sentinel-2 sensor have been investigated for a variety of vegetation monitoring [14,15], terrestrial monitoring [16], and forest classification [16] applications, only a few studies have used Sentinel-2 for land cover mapping [17][18][19]. Therefore, additional studies that evaluate the utility of this imagery for land cover classification for regions with extremely diverse conditions such as those in Dak Nong are well-justified [20].As previously, Dak Nong presents unique challenges for the construction of accurate remote sensing-based land use land cover (LULC) maps [12].

        <p>Factors that affect classification accuracy include sensor type, sources of training and accuracy assessment data, the number of classes, and the classification method [21][22][23]. Of these factors, the selection of a suitable algorithm that achieves acceptable classification accuracy with minimal processing time can be crucial [24]. Many methods have been proposed for constructing satellite image-based land cover maps [25,26], including both unsupervised and supervised methods and both parametric and non-parametric methods. Although unsupervised algorithms such as 
            <rs type="software">IsoData</rs> and K-Means clustering have been widely used for many years, general purpose clustering algorithms are cumbersome and difficult to develop [27]. Parametric supervised algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis [28][29][30][31] and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) have also been broadly used [32,33] and are often considered standards for comparison purposes [29,30,34]. In the last decade, non-parametric methods including support vector machine (SVM) [35][36][37], k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) [38,39], and random forests (RF) [40][41][42] have gained attention for remote sensing-based land cover classification. However, both SVM and RF require the selection of values for multiple parameters that affect their efficacy, and both are computationally intensive [6,35]. For k-NN, Naidoo et al. (2012) [43] reported difficulty in selecting the optimal value of k and that the genetic algorithms recommended for optimization can be computationally intensive [44,45]. Finally, object-based classification has been shown to be an effective method for classifying fine resolution imagery [46,47]. Object-based methods have been used with both fuzzy sets [48,49] and neural networks [48,50] to map land cover using satellite imagery. Although object-based classification methods have been shown to increase accuracy for some land cover mapping applications, fine spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery remains the most frequently used data source for these applications [51].

        <p>Because of the unique features of each study and study area including definitions, sample sizes, and numbers and characteristics of the classes, comparisons of methods with respect to accuracy among studies is difficult. Even so, not much effort has been committed to comparing methods with respect to accuracy for diverse tropical forest regions such as Dak Nong. Meyfroidt et al., 2013 [52] used MLR with Landsat data to assess classes of forest change and reported land cover classification accuracies of 0.64 to 0.69. Use of RF for land cover classification has been reported for multiple studies in Vietnam. Bourgoin et al. (in press) [53] used RF with both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for multiple land cover and land cover change classes and reported an overall accuracy of 0.81. Nguyen et al. (2018) [6] used RF and Landsat data for 10 classes including multiple forest classes in Vietnam. Overall accuracy was approximately 0.90. Ha et al. (2018) [54] used RF and Landsat data for seven land cover classes including forest land and reported overall accuracies greater than 0.90. Finally, Phan and Kappas (2018) [20] reported that SVM was more accurate than RF for classifying six types of land cover types including one forest class in the North of Vietnam (Red River Delta) using Sentinel-2 data. In summary, although only a few studies using only a few methods have been used for the classification of forest land in Vietnam, the reported accuracies are relatively large. Thus, there is merit in a more comprehensive evaluation of classification methods, particularly for diverse tropical regions such as in Dak Nong province, Vietnam, with their distinct seasonal effects.Because of the unique features of each study and study area including definitions, sample sizes, and numbers and characteristics of the classes, comparisons of methods with respect to accuracy among studies is difficult.

The spectrum characteristics of the Sentinel 2 images are described in Table 1. The difference in solar illumination geometry during image acquisition between the two seasons was considered in the present study. Although vegetation in the study area presents reduced climatic and phonological seasonality, the observed reflectance varies by season owing to changes in the solar illumination geometry caused by the Earth's translation movement [13]. Therefore, seasonal image datasets were separately classified to evaluate these influences. Accordingly, the scenes of interest included the following: (i) a collection of Sentinel-2 MSI scenes in the study area during the dry season of 2017 and 2018 (1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017, and 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2018), designated imagery 1 (IMG 1) (Table 2); (ii) a collection of Sentinel-2 MSI scenes during the rainy season of 2017 and 2018 (from 1 April 2017 to 30 November 2017 and 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018), designated IMG 2; (iii) a collection of Sentinel 2 MSI scenes for all months of 2017 (from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017), designated IMG 3; and (iv) a combination of all bands for the dry and rainy seasons (combination of IMG 1 and IMG 2, designated IMG 4. The different seasonal image datasets represented for each season were considered for the analyses based on the median value of the collection. The multi-spectral bands in the study included Blue (B2), Green (B3), Red (B4), Red Edge 1 (B5), Red Edge 2 (B6), Red Edge 3 (B7), near infrared (NIR) (B8), Red Edge 4 (B8A), short-wave infrared (SWIR) 1 (B11), and SWIR 2 (B12). In addition to these spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital elevation model (DEM) were added to the seasonal image data (IMG 1-4) with the objective of increasing classification accuracy, as reported from previous studies [22,57]. These bands, including NDVI [58,59] and DEM, were resampled at 10 m resolution.

Accordingly, the scenes of interest included the following: (i) a collection of Sentinel-2 MSI scenes in the study area during the dry season of 2017 and 2018 (1 January 2017 to 31 March 2017, and 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2018), designated imagery 1 (IMG 1) (Table 2); (ii) a collection of Sentinel-2 MSI scenes during the rainy season of 2017 and 2018 (from 1 April 2017 to 30 November 2017 and 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018), designated IMG 2; (iii) a collection of Sentinel 2 MSI scenes for all months of 2017 (from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017), designated IMG 3; and (iv) a combination of all bands for the dry and rainy seasons (combination of IMG 1 and IMG 2, designated IMG 4. The different seasonal image datasets represented for each season were considered for the analyses based on the median value of the collection. The multi-spectral bands in the study included Blue (B2), Green (B3), Red (B4), Red Edge 1 (B5), Red Edge 2 (B6), Red Edge 3 (B7), near infrared (NIR) (B8), Red Edge 4 (B8A), short-wave infrared (SWIR) 1 (B11), and SWIR 2 (B12). In addition to these spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a digital elevation model (DEM) were added to the seasonal image data (IMG 1-4) with the objective of increasing classification accuracy, as reported from previous studies [22,57]. These bands, including NDVI [58,59] and DEM, were resampled at 10 m resolution. Image information is described in Table 2 below.</p>
        <p>To conduct the analyses, the JavaScript API Code Editor in the 
            <rs type="software">Google Earth Engine (GEE)</rs> was used to collect data for a large number of images. GEE provides most freely available image data and an application programming interface (API) to analyze and visualize the data [60,61]. Surface reflectance (SR) images for 2017 were not available, and for 2018 images, approximately 50% of the study area was covered by clouds. Hence, a top of atmosphere (TOA) dataset acquired for 2017 and 2018 was used for the study. The set of collected images was pre-processed to reduce the effects of topography and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). At the same time, cloud areas were masked out and shadows were removed during this process.
        </p>
        <p>All images underwent pixel-wise cloud and cloud shadow masking using the Google cloudScore algorithm for cloud masking and temporal dark outlier mask (TDOM) for cloud shadows, both of which built on ideas from Landsat TDOM and cloudScore algorithm. The original concept was written by Carson Stam, adapted by Ian Housman, currently documented in [60], and described and evaluated in a forthcoming paper [62]. This study implemented the correction of reflectance spectral values by BRDF based on the method described by Roy et al. 2017a,b [63,64]. Topographic correction is the process to account for diffuse atmospheric irradiance caused by slope, aspect, and elevation effects. The sun-canopy-sensor + C (SCSc) correction method based on the C-correction, as described by Soenen et al. [65], was applied for topographic correction in this study. The median function was then applied to create an image object (single image) representing the median value of all images in the filtered collection [66,67]. The median lies closer to the majority of values and is insensitive to extreme values and has exactly half the values smaller and half the values greater than the median, as elaborately applied by [68]. The post-processed images were then resampled to a spatial resolution of 10 m using the nearest neighbor method [69], and subsetted to the study area. The entire pre-processing was implemented on GEE based on the

        <p>Within the study area, 11 LULC classes were distinguished: (1) dense evergreen broadleaved forest (the forest has been slightly impacted); (2) open evergreen broadleaved forest (the forest has been moderately to heavily disturbed); (3) semi-evergreen forest (the forest that consists of a mixture of evergreen and deciduous dipterocarp tree species); (4) deciduous dipterocarp forest; (5) plantation forest; (6) mature rubber (≥3 years old); (7) perennial industrial plants; (8) croplands (annual crop land); (9) residential area; (10) water surface; and (11) other lands including, but not limited to, other types of grassland, shrubs, bare land, and abandoned land.Within the study area, 11 LULC classes were distinguished: (1) dense evergreen broadleaved forest (the forest has been slightly impacted); (2) open evergreen broadleaved forest (the forest has been moderately to heavily disturbed); (3) semi-evergreen forest (the forest that consists of a mixture of evergreen and deciduous dipterocarp tree species); (4) deciduous dipterocarp forest; (5) plantation forest; (6) mature rubber (≥3 years old); (7) perennial industrial plants; (8) croplands (annual crop land); (9) residential area; (10) water surface; and (11) other lands including, but not limited to, other types of grassland, shrubs, bare land, and abandoned land.</p>
        <p>Acquiring adequate training and validation data is often challenging in tropical regions. Sothe et al., 2017 [13] and Teluguntla et al., 2018 [71] both obtained good results using sample data from a combination of sources including field investigations, very fine spatial resolution Google Earth imagery, current Landsat and Sentinel imagery, and other sources such as maps. A similar approach was used for this study for which three sets of sample data were acquired in 2017 and 2018: (1) field observations for a purposive sample of size 232; (2) visual interpretations of fine and very fine resolution imagery from sources that included 
            <rs type="software">Google Earth</rs> for a purposive sample size of 214; and (3) visual interpretations of fine and very fine resolution imagery from sources that included 
            <rs type="software">Google Earth</rs> and Sentinel-2A imagery for a simple random sample size of 800. For the latter sample dataset, field observations and data from the 2016 Dak Nong Forest Inventory Map were used to clarify and refine interpretations for the LULC classes such as semi-evergreen forest, plantation forest, and some perennial industrial crops that were difficult to distinguish in the imagery.

Therefore, selection of the kernel function and appropriate values for corresponding kernel parameters, referred to as the kernel configuration, can affect the performance of the SVM.According to Huang et al.

        <p>The radial basis function kernel (RBF kernel) is one of the most popular kernels used to implement the support vector machine algorithm and was used for this study. The squared Euclidean distance metric was used to construct completely non-linear hyperplanes. The RBF kernel of the SVM classifier is commonly used and has performed well. Polynomial kernels, especially high-order kernels, took far more time to train than RBF kernels [35]. Meyer et al. (2002) [76] stated that, for classification tasks, C-classification is most likely used with the RBF kernel because of its good general performance and the small number of parameters (only two, C and γ). Therefore, the two parameters that must be defined for this classification algorithm are the cost parameter (C) and the kernel width parameter (γ). According to Knorn et al. (2009) [77] (p.960), C is a regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the training error. C is a preset penalty value for misclassification errors, while γ describes the kernel width, which affects the smoothing of the shape of the class-dividing hyperplane.The radial basis function kernel (RBF kernel) is one of the most popular kernels used to implement the support vector machine algorithm and was used for this study.

        <p>The authors of LIBSVM suggest trying small and large values for C, such as 1 to 1000, then using cross-validation to decide which is optimal for the data, and finally trying several γ's for the optimal C's. A small C-value tends to emphasize the margin while ignoring the outliers in the training data, while a large C-value may overfit the training data [77] (p.960). Optimal selection of C and γ parameters was done by testing C parameters in the range 2 -1 to 2 8 and γ parameters in the range 0.1 to 2.0.The authors of LIBSVM suggest trying small and large values for C, such as 1 to 1000, then using cross-validation to decide which is optimal for the data, and finally trying several γ's for the optimal C's.

        <p>The RF classifier developed by Breiman (2001) [78] requires selection of three parameters: ntree (number of trees to grow), mtry (the number of variables to split each node), and variable importance (the number of variables/bands influences model performance). Liaw &amp; Wiener (2002) [79] recommend using the square root of the number of input variables as the default value for mtry. A large value for ntree produces a stable result for variable importance, which is estimated using two indicators: (i) mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and ii) mean decrease gini (MDG). MDA is the accuracy associated with each predictor variable based on the out-of-bag error rate (OOB). Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly labeled if it is randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. For this study, MDA values were investigated to determine the importance of variables. Nguyen et al. (2018) [6] indicated that within the range 1 ≤ ntree ≤ 500, ntree = 300 produced the best fit. In addition, Breiman (2001) [78] stated that using more than the required number of trees may be unnecessary, albeit not harmful, because the relationship between accuracy and ntree is asymptotic.

        <p>Accuracy assessment is an important step before accepting a classification result [21]. The classification accuracy of a map product is estimated by constructing a confusion matrix between reference and classified pixels. Classification accuracy was assessed using criteria such as overall accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient (K), producer's accuracy (PA), and user's accuracy (UA). Congalton and Green (1999) [80] assert that analysis of the causes of differences in the confusion matrix can be one of the most important and interesting steps in the construction of a map from remotely sensed data.Accuracy assessment is an important step before accepting a classification result [21].

The log-likelihood stabilized after 100 iterations. The importance of the variables was quite similar among different Sentinel-2 datasets. For the dry season image (IMG 1) and for the all-month image (IMG 3), the most important variables were Blue and SWIR 2, otherwise, the variable importance values were approximately the same. For the rainy season image (IMG 2), the results were also similar, although the Blue and SWIR 2 importance values were slightly less than for IMG 1 and IMG 3. Differences among importance values were small for the two-season image (IMG 4).

The algorithm assesses the importance of each variable in the classification process by means of a specific measure. 'Importance()' and 'varImplot()' functions were used to determine the MDA values and to select the potential variables that were actually needed for the optimal RF models. Figure 4 shows the variable importance ranked in the direction of decreasing MDA from right to left for the four seasonal images. The selection of variables was based on MDA using the backward selection method [85]. With this method, the algorithm starts with all predictor variables and then sequentially removes some variables until the greatest accuracy is achieved. Accordingly, the least MDAs were attributed to two bands of IMG 1, 2, and 3: specifically, B6 and B8 for IMG 1 and B6 and B7 for both IMG 2 and IMG 3. For IMG 4, the five bands were included: B5a, B2a, B2b, B7a, and B8b. In addition, the NIR band reduced the accuracy for all images. For the IMG 2-SVM combination and the IMG 4-SVM combination, the optimal C of 2 3 and Gamma of 0.1 produced classification errors of 0.2283 and 0.1525, respectively, while for the IMG 1-SVM and IMG 3-SVM combinations, the optimal C of 2 5 and 2 6 , both with Gamma of 0.1, produced classification errors of 0.2212 and 0.2145, respectively.The three RF parameters, ntree, mtry, and variable importance, play important roles in classification.

        <p>Indeed, many studies have been conducted to select the most accurate classifier, either among those simultaneously evaluated or with classifiers evaluated in other studies. Such works reach no consensus, because the performance of a classifier always depends on the specific site characteristics, on the type and quality of the remotely sensed data, and also on the number and general aspects of the classes of interest [13]. Using the RF, SVM, maximum likelihood, and neural network classification algorithms to discriminate among four individual land cover classes based on two Landsat-8 OLI scenes, Lowe and Kulkarni (2015) [40] reported overall classification accuracies of 96.25%, 86.88%, 83.13%, and 76.87%, respectively. Kennedy et al. (2015) [41] used RF to classify Landsat time-series data from 1198 training patches for four classes (agriculture, forest, urbanization, and stream) and reported OA greater than 80%, but most successfully for the numerically well-represented forest management class. Meanwhile, Franco-Lopez (2001) [38] used k-NN to map 13 types of land cover using Landsat TM and achieved OA = 64%. Tomppo et al. (2008) [92] reported OA between 70% and 80% for classifying dominant tree species in one boreal forest test site in Finland when using two adjacent Landsat 7 ETM+ scenes and the ik-NN method. Pelletier et al. ( 2016) [18] used RF and SVM algorithms to classify SPOT-4 imagery and Landsat-8 HR-SITS images in southern France. The authors reported an OA of 83.3% for RF and 77.1% for SVM. Research by Phan and Kappas (2017) [20] showed different results among RF, SVM, and k-NN classifiers used to discriminate six types of LULC using Sentinel-2 image data in the Red River Delta of Vietnam. This research reported that SVM produced the greatest OA (95.29%) with the least sensitivity to the training sample sizes, followed consecutively by RF (94.44%) and k-NN (94.13%). These results indicate that no standard of accuracy is appropriate for all cases, because accuracy relevance depends on both the objective and the user.Indeed, many studies have been conducted to select the most accurate classifier, either among those simultaneously evaluated or with classifiers evaluated in other studies.

        <p>Spatial information including remotely sensed data has been an excellent source of information for decision makers in forest management, albeit in conjunction with an understanding of classification uncertainties, whereby the probabilities of non-optimal and infeasible decisions are reduced. For this study, OA ranged from 63.9% to 80.3% (Figure 7) when using Sentinel 2 data to classify 11 LULC classes, with SVM producing the greatest accuracies. The difference between accuracies for the most accurate SVM classifier and the least accurate MLR classifier was approximately 14.4%. Although the results for SVM and RF were relatively similar, some authors recommend RF because training is less time-consuming and parameter selection is easier [18], a recommendation that was confirmed in our study.Spatial information including remotely sensed data has been an excellent source of information for decision makers in forest management, albeit in conjunction with an understanding of classification uncertainties, whereby the probabilities of non-optimal and infeasible decisions are reduced.

        <p>Producer's and user's accuracies among the 11 LULC classes differed considerably (Figure 9). In general, the open evergreen forest classes were confused more than the other forest cover classes. This result is attributed to the heterogeneous conditions of natural tropical forests. In addition, forests in the study area have been disturbed to different degrees [21]. Among the forest classes, deciduous dipterocarp and semi-evergreen forest are considered the most challenging for remote sensing classification because of the seasonal deciduous characteristics of these forest types in the dry season [93]. However, this problem may be solved by using the combination of dry and rainy season images, as investigated in the present study.Producer's and user's accuracies among the 11 LULC classes differed considerably (Figure 9).

        <p>The Sentinel-2 images acquired for different seasons (plant growth stages) produced different results. The greatest accuracies were for the composite rainy and dry season IMG 4; by contrast, the lowest accuracies were for the rainy season IMG 2. The observed reflectance varied by season owing to changes in the solar illumination geometry caused by the Earth's translation movement. In addition, the vegetation in the study area varies depending on the season, owing to the substantial rainfall differences for the two seasons. Sothe et al. (2017) [13] assert that differences in classification accuracies for the dry and rainy seasons can be attributed to the differences in solar illumination geometry between the two seasons. For images acquired in the dry season, the incident sun radiation arrives in a more perpendicular direction to the Earth's surface, thus reducing the shadow effect caused by topography and variations in the forest canopy height, and leading to greater pixel illumination. For the current study, there was a substantial increase in classification accuracies when using a composite of dry and rainy Sentinel 2 images (IMG 4). For the ik-NN, RF, and SVM classifiers, the greatest accuracies were obtained for the combined rainy and dry IMG 4 relative to the rainy or dry season alone (Table 6). The accuracy increase for the composite image may be explained by the fact that different seasons contain different information for the same kind of land cover (e.g., dipterocarp forest is deciduous in dry seasons and green in rainy seasons). Combining the two season's image bands captures additional information on land cover. Among all combinations of images, classification algorithms, and land classes, the smallest SE for area estimates was for the water surface class owing to its stability, whereas the largest SE was for the industrial plant class. In fact, because cultivation characteristics of industrial plants in the study area are quite complex with a variety of species such as coffee, pepper, and cashew, all with uneven ages, large SEs are inevitable. This complexity also explains the large difference among area estimates for this class, ranging from 1643.45 km 2 to 2223.87 km 2 , or from 25% to 34% of the total area (Figure 10).The Sentinel-2 images acquired for different seasons (plant growth stages) produced different results. The greatest accuracies were for the composite rainy and dry season IMG 4; by contrast, the lowest accuracies were for the rainy season IMG 2. The observed reflectance varied by season owing to changes in the solar illumination geometry caused by the Earth's translation movement.

        <p>Although classification accuracies for vegetation classes were not particularly large, the classifications are still useful for complex tropical rain forests that have been disturbed to different degrees such as in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The area estimates and spatial distributions of the LULC classes produced from the current study will assist local authorities, managers, and other stakeholders in decision-making and planning regarding forest land cover and uses. The usual practice is for the Institution of Forest inventory and Planning (FIPI) to conduct a forest inventory and construct a forest map every five years. Local forest units such as Dak Nong receive the maps and update them manually. However, the accuracy of the map has usually not been announced, and inaccuracies and errors have been detected only by local forest staff when patrolling in the field. Moreover, LULC changes, particularly for industrial land, occur quickly and easily owing to factors such as unstable crop markets and increasing population resulting from migration. Thus, the results of this study will not only provide authorities with updated information on current conditions, but will also serve as a recommendation regarding methods for proactively updating LULC maps in a timely and costly manner. Specifically, timely and updated maps assist authorities by serving as a basis for formulating suitable solutions and policies for managing LULC including forest cover.Although classification accuracies for vegetation classes were not particularly large, the classifications are still useful for complex tropical rain forests that have been disturbed to different degrees such as in the Central Highlands of Vietnam.

        <p>This research showed the utility of combining Sentinel-2, multi-spectral, and dry and rainy season band data when mapping LULCs in Dak Nong Province, Vietnam. The greatest accuracies were achieved for the composite IMG 4 obtained by combining dry and rainy season image sets using the SVM classifier.This research showed the utility of combining Sentinel-2, multi-spectral, and dry and rainy season band data when mapping LULCs in Dak Nong Province, Vietnam.

        <p>Among the classifiers, SVM produced the greatest accuracies, although RF, which had similar accuracies, was simpler to train and apply, and was less computationally intensive. For IMG 4, the greatest accuracies with SVM were OA = 80.3% and Kappa index = 0.813; for RF, the greatest accuracies were OA = 80.0% and K = 0.802. Thus, the combination of dry and rainy season imagery used with the SVM or RF may contribute to potentially new ways for classifying the complex tropical forest of Vietnam and similar areas. The area estimates and spatial distributions of the LULC classes produced from the current study will assist local authorities, managers, and other stakeholders in decision-making and planning regarding forest land cover and uses.Among the classifiers, SVM produced the greatest accuracies, although RF, which had similar accuracies, was simpler to train and apply, and was less computationally intensive.

        <p>In conclusion, the two-season, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images provided useful data for classifying LULC classes in areas with substantial fragmentation, especially for natural forests that have been disturbed and degraded at different levels such as in Dak Nong, Vietnam. The SVM and RF machine learning algorithms were both accurate classifiers when used with the Sentinel 2 imagery. The methods developed for this study are applicable to boreal and temporal forests with different classes in addition to the tropical forests for the current study. However, the model parameters always need to be re-estimated for each application.In conclusion, the two-season, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images provided useful data for classifying LULC classes in areas with substantial fragmentation, especially for natural forests that have been disturbed and degraded at different levels such as in Dak Nong, Vietnam.
