        <p>The modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV), traditionally defined as statistical patterns of variance, reflect to first order the ocean's integration (i.e., reddening) of atmospheric forcing that arises from both a shift and a change in strength of the climatological (time-mean) atmospheric circulation. While these patterns concisely describe PDV, they do not distinguish among the key dynamical processes driving the evolution of PDV anomalies, including atmospheric and ocean teleconnections and coupled feedbacks with similar spatial structures that operate on different timescales. In this review, we synthesize past analysis using an empirical dynamical model constructed from monthly ocean surface anomalies drawn from several reanalysis products, showing that the PDV modes of variance result from two fundamental low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes: the North Pacific-central Pacific (NP-CP) and Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) modes. Both eigenmodes highlight how two-way tropical-extratropical teleconnection dynamics are the primary mechanisms energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale footprint of PDV. While the NP-CP mode captures interannual-to decadal-scale variability, the KOE mode is linked to the basin-scale expression of PDV on decadal to multidecadal timescales, including contributions from the South Pacific.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the low-frequency variability of the climate system has been described in terms of modes of decadal variability, sometimes called oscillations due to their spatial (seesaw-like) structure, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Mantua et al. 1997), the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008), the South Pacific Decadal Oscillation (SPDO) (Hsu &amp; Chen 2011), and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) (Power et al. 1999). However, most of the named modes do not exhibit a preferred timescale of variability (specifically, they are not periodic), since they are designed to capture statistical patterns that efficiently represent strong low-frequency variance on interannual to multidecadal timescales, rather than low-frequency dynamical modes of the Pacific climate system (Monahan et al. 2009). Nevertheless, modulations of these patterns are linked to significant impacts on weather and extremes of the Americas and Asia (Alexander 2010, Deser et al. 2010, Dai 2013, Wei et al. 2021, Xu et al. 2021) and to large-amplitude transitions in marine ecosystems (Mantua et al. 1997, Hare et al. 1999, Bograd et al. 2019, Yati et al. 2020, van der Sleen et al. 2022). Recent examples of these modes impacting extremes include marine heatwaves and droughts over North America in 2013-2015and 2019(Swain 2015, Amaya et al. 2016, Di Lorenzo &amp; Mantua 2016, Seager &amp; Henderson 2016, Capotondi et al. 2019, Holbrook et al. 2019, Xu et al. 2021) and tropical storms (Chu &amp; Clark 1999).</p>
        <p>Building on a previous review focused on the predictability of the Pacific climate modes (Liu &amp; Di Lorenzo 2018), this article focuses on discussing significant advances in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms, including global-and basin-scale teleconnection dynamics, that act to energize the temporal and spatial structures of the dynamical modes of Pacific decadal-scale variability (PDV). To this end, this review is organized as follows. We begin by reviewing the dominant statistical modes of observed ocean and atmosphere variability of the Pacific basin (Section 2) and provide a first-order understanding of how these patterns are forced in the extratropics and how they are related to the tropics. We then outline an empirical dynamical modeling approach (Section 3) that helps identify the dynamical modes of the Pacific system and provides insight into the mechanisms that energize the low-frequency climate variance. These mechanisms are then analyzed in detail (Section 4) to review our current hypotheses of the role of basin-scale teleconnections and tropical-extratropical coupling dynamics. Given that most of our understanding is constrained by one realization of the observed world, we discuss (Section 3) how robust and stable the mechanisms of PDV are when considering an ensemble view of climate where the same world can lead to different realizations of the patterns and mechanisms of Pacific climate. We close with a summary of the main mechanisms and future challenges (Section 5).</p>
        <p>The global decadal-scale variability of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) shows that the tropical and North Pacific, together with the North Atlantic, are the most energetic regions of lowfrequency (e.g., 8-year low pass) variability. Previous analyses of global SSTa have documented that several modes of PDV are main contributors to both global climate variability (Messie &amp; Chavez 2011) and fluctuations of the global warming trend, such as the 1998-2013 hiatus (Meehl et al. 2011, Kosaka &amp; Xie 2013, Watanabe et al. 2013, England et al. 2014). These results are evident by decomposing the variance of the global 8-year low-pass SSTa into its first two empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). The first decadal global mode (Figure 1a), explaining 34% of the total decadal variance, shows loading in the Pacific basin that resembles the classical El Niño-like pattern of decadal variability (Zhang et al. 1997). The second global mode (Figure 1b) is characterized by strong loading in both the northeast Pacific and the central tropical Pacific, where tropical Pacific decadal-scale variability (TPDV) is typically a maximum (Power et al. 2021). Together, these two global modes capture the different flavors of PDV. This can be visualized and quantified by defining a PDV mode that is equal to the sum of global mode 1 and global mode 2 (i.e., a rotation in the plane of the first two EOFs). The resulting pattern (Figure 1c) is now dominated entirely by the Pacific basin, and the temporal evolution of the PDV mode is strongly and significantly correlated with the IPO (R = 0.96) (Figure 1e) and all other indices of the major named modes of Pacific climate variability. In fact, we can reconstruct each of the Pacific climate modes' indices as a simple linear combination of the two global mode time series as a • global mode 1 + b • global mode 2 (Figure 1e), where the coefficients a and b represent the relative weighting of the two modes.</p>
        <p>We also show the pattern arising from taking the difference between the two global modes (Figure 1d), which recovers an interhemispheric mode of opposite signs whose corresponding time series is strongly correlated with that of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (R = 0.9) (Knight et al. 2006, Deser et al. 2010, Levine et al. 2017) and its Pacific footprint (Y.-M. Yang et al. 2020). Regardless of how we combine these global modes, it is clear that PDV plays a major role in global low-frequency climate variability. We also note that similar results are obtained from a Pacific-only analysis-that is, one based on recomputing the two leading EOFs from the 8-year low-pass SSTa only within the Pacific basin between 62°S and 62°N (Figure 1a,b). This similarity indicates that this variance decomposition is robust in the Pacific sector and suggests that PDV is linked to the dynamics of other basins, as is evident from the spatial expressions of the PDV global modes in the North Atlantic (e.g., the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation pattern) (Kucharski et al. 2016, Screen &amp; Francis 2016, Levine et al. 2017, Deepa et al. 2019, Nigam et al. 2020, X.-Y. Yang et al. 2020). 1960 1970 1980 1990</p>
        <p>To provide a first-order understanding of the origin of the dominant patterns of PDV in the extratropics, we also need to consider the mean circulation of the atmosphere and its variability. Over the Pacific basin, the time-mean sea level pressure (Figure 2a) is characterized by the presence of large-scale pressure systems, such as the winter Aleutian Low (AL) and summer North Pacific High in the Northern Hemisphere and the South Pacific High in the Southern Hemisphere. These pressure systems undergo modulations in their positions and strength on all timescales, whose variability can be quantified by the EOF modes. Specifically in the North Pacific, the leading EOF mode of sea level pressure anomalies captures a change in the position and strength of the AL (Trenberth &amp; Hurrell 1994, Chhak et al. 2009) (Figure 2b), while the second mode tracks changes in the strength of the mean North Pacific circulation, with a dipolar structure (Figure 2c) colocated over the centers of action of the North Pacific High and AL. This second leading atmospheric mode has been named the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) (Rogers 1981, Linkin &amp; Nigam 2008). Similarly, in the South Pacific, the leading mode of variability in atmospheric sea level pressure anomalies, excluding the Antarctic region south of 50°S, captures changes in the mean circulation of the South Pacific High (Figure 2d) and is referred to as the South Pacific Oscillation (SPO) (You &amp; Furtado 2017).</p>
        <p>The atmospheric modes described above (Figure 2) have an oceanic footprint in SSTa and other physical-biological variables, since they drive an ocean response through changes in surface winds and heat fluxes that project onto the dominant modes of extratropical ocean decadal variability. Specifically, in the North Pacific, the AL mode drives the largest fraction of variance in the SSTa pattern of the PDO (first EOF of SSTa) (Mantua et al. 1997, Zhang et al. 1997) (Figure 2e). Similarly, the NPO drives the NPGO, which is defined as the second EOF of sea surface height in the northeast Pacific (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008) and closely tracks the second EOF of SSTa-also referred to as the Victoria mode (Bond et al. 2003) (Figure 2f ). Additionally, the boreal winter ( January-March) expression of the NPGO tracks the SSTa footprint of the North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) (Chiang &amp; Vimont 2004, Amaya 2019). In the South Pacific, the SPO drives the dominant mode of SSTa, the SPDO (Chen &amp; Wallace 2015, Lou et al. 2019) (Figure 2g). However, in contrast to the North Pacific, the SPO undergoes substantial seasonal fluctuations, and during boreal spring (February-April), the oceanic footprint of this atmospheric mode consists of a different SSTa pattern that emerges as the second mode of SSTa variability and is referred to as the South Pacific quadrupole pattern (Zheng &amp; Wang 2017, Lou et al. 2021) or the South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM) (Zhang et al. 2014, Larson et al. 2018, Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo 2020) (Figure 2h).</p>
        <p>(Caption appears on following page) Atmospheric variability is largely on daily through seasonal timescales, so it may be approximated with a white power spectrum on the decadal timescales of interest here. The ocean, however, integrates and thereby reddens this atmospheric forcing (Newman et al. 2003, Rudnick &amp; Davis 2003, Schneider &amp; Cornuelle 2005, Vimont 2005, Deser et al. 2010)-that is, the ability of the ocean to integrate over time the high-frequency variability of the atmosphere and essentially act as a low-pass filter. This process helps drive low-frequency (i.e., red power spectrum) variability in the oceanic PDV modes. The timescale over which the ocean can accumulate the atmospheric forcing is set by the internal memory of oceanic dynamics, including the ability of the mixed layer to store heat, oceanic wave adjustments to wind perturbations, and other longer-timescale memory dynamics, such as reemergence (Deser et al. 2003, Namias &amp; Born 1974) and the subduction of heat anomalies in the ocean subsurface (Schneider et al. 1999;Taguchi &amp; Schneider 2014;Pozo Buil &amp; Di Lorenzo 2015, 2017).</p>
        <p>A fundamental model used to explain oceanic reddening was first introduced by Hasselmann (1976) in a one-dimensional equation:</p>
        <p>where the rate of change of the anomalies of an oceanic variable O(t) on the left-hand side is driven by atmospheric anomalies A(t) scaled by a conversion factor α, and where the oceanic anomaly exponentially decays with a timescale of τ , representing the memory of the oceanic variable being considered. When discretized into a difference equation, this model is equivalent to an autoregressive model of order 1 (AR-1), which is a known low-frequency filter. Using this simple model, one can reconstruct the time series of the PDO, NPGO, and SPDO by simply forcing Equation 1with the atmospheric time series of the AL, NPO, and SPO modes, respectively, and using τ = 8-12 months, which is the typical decay rate of SSTa in the extratropics (Chhak et al. 2009, Di Lorenzo et al. 2013). By correlating the output of Equation 1 with basin-scale SSTa, we recover the global footprints of the PDV modes (e.g., Figure 2e-h).</p>
        <p>Although the simple one-dimensional model in Equation 1 works very well in recovering the oceanic modes and providing a simple explanation of the emergence of these patterns, it is important to recognize that it does not allow us to separate and understand the large-scale dynamics that energize the variance of the atmospheric modes, including feedbacks from the extratropical and tropical oceans captured in the oceanic modes themselves. Consequently, several studies have aimed to identify different drivers of the PDO, NPGO, and SPDO by separating the atmospheric variable on the right-hand side of Equation 1 into its extratropical and tropical teleconnection components (Schneider &amp; Cornuelle 2005, Shakun &amp; Shaman 2009, Lou et al. 2019, Zhao et al. 2021b). In fact, as we discuss in more depth in Section 4, teleconnection dynamics to and from the tropics play a major role in shaping the low-frequency variability of the Pacific basin and its extratropical decadal modes.</p>
        <p>Most of the dominant modes of Pacific SSTa (e.g., the PDO and SPDO; Figure 2e,g) show a clear signal in the tropics, highlighting their links to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and TPDV (Power et al. 2021). ENSO is the dominant phenomenon of tropical Pacific variability on seasonal to interannual timescales, and its teleconnections to the extratropics impact oceanatmosphere and ecosystem variability across the entire Pacific basin (Bjerknes 1968, Alexander et al. 2002). Moreover, ENSO can both influence and be influenced by extratropical variability (Chang et al. 2007, Larson &amp; Kirtman 2014, Zhang et al. 2014, Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo 2020, Capotondi &amp; Ricciardulli 2021, Lou et al. 2021). In fact, the effects of these teleconnections (further described in Section 4.1) are also reddened by extratropical oceanic memory into ENSO-like decadal variability (Di Lorenzo et al. 2015), which is captured in the PDV pattern (Figure 1c). This ENSO-like SSTa pattern emerges in the low-frequency expression of the PDO, NPGO, SPDO, and IPO and is consistent with the TPDV (Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo 2020), defined as the leading EOF of the 8-year low-pass SSTa over the tropical Pacific between 5°S and 5°N. Consistent with this finding, the time series of the TPDV mode is highly correlated with the 8-year low-pass indices of all the major statistical modes of Pacific climate (Figure 1e).</p>
        <p>These simple analyses indicate that the statistical modes of low-frequency Pacific variability capture different flavors of basin-wide and local-scale decadal variability (e.g., Zhang et al. 2018). Practically, while the modes and patterns of variance defined from EOFs provide important hints of the key mechanisms of PDV, these modes do not track individual processes but are the result of several dynamical mechanisms that rely on tropical or extratropical teleconnections with ENSO and ocean-atmosphere coupling.</p>
        <p>While the statistical modes of PDV provide a useful description of Pacific low-frequency climate variability and are routinely used to identify and predict how climate variability impacts biogeochemical cycles, marine ecosystems, weather, and climate extremes (Mantua et al. 1997, Hare &amp; Mantua 2000, Yati et al. 2020), the objective of this review is to identify and understand the physical mechanisms of the dynamical modes of Pacific climate variability. The computation of climate modes through EOFs imposes an orthogonality constraint in the spatial patterns and temporal evolution of the modes. However, as noted above, in the low-frequency regime, these modes converge to similar patterns of variability (e.g., ENSO-like) and are spatially nonorthogonal outside the geographical regions where the modes are defined (see, e.g., the PDO and SPDO in Figure 2e,g). This finding indicates that the orthogonality constraint is an artifact of the definition and not a physical constraint. Moreover, eigenmodes of physical dynamical systems are typically not orthogonal (e.g., Monahan et al. 2009), due to asymmetries both in space (such as differing regions of strong or weak gradients) and between variables (such as when one variable appears in the tendency equation of a second variable but not vice versa). In fact, strong evidence exists that the modes obtained with statistical approaches, such as ENSO and the PDO, result from the constructive superposition of several nonorthogonal dynamical modes (Farrell 1988, Penland &amp; Sardeshmukh 1995). Unfortunately, computing the dynamical modes of the Pacific climate system is nontrivial and relies on our ability to perform an eigenmode analysis of the true dynamical operator controlling the evolution of this system. While a full knowledge of such an operator is hard to obtain apart from very simplified physical models, it is possible to use empirical approaches to approximate this operator from observations, in an inverse sense, and determine its eigenmodes. Here, we use one such empirical dynamical model of Pacific SSTa to examine the spatial and temporal variability of observed dynamical modes.</p>
        <p>In Section 1, we introduced a simple one-dimensional AR-1 model (Equation 1) to illustrate how the ocean can integrate the atmospheric forcing and filter the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere. We can more generally extend this model to a multivariate formulation to approximate the evolution of a suitably averaged climate anomaly state vector x(t ) as dx dt = Lx + ξ 2. (Hasselmann 1976, Penland &amp; Sardeshmukh 1995), where L is a linear dynamical operator and ξ is a vector of temporally white noise. Although linear, this model can accommodate the nonlinear portion of climate dynamics through the noise term under the assumption that the temporal evolutions decorrelate much faster than the linear dynamics. For example, nonlinear forcing of the ocean by weather occurs on timescales that are typically much shorter than oceanic memory timescales and may therefore by approximated by a linear feedback term plus a white noise remainder (Frankignoul &amp; Hasselmann 1977), an approximation that may also be extended to include advection by strong oceanic currents (Frankignoul &amp; Reynolds 1983).</p>
        <p>From Equation 2, the most likely solution of the state of x at t + τ is given by the ensemble average evolution,</p>
        <p>with the noise terms providing the ensemble spread about this mean (i.e., less likely outcomes).</p>
        <p>Equations 2 and 3 are commonly referred to as a linear inverse model (LIM) (Penland &amp; Matrosova 1994, Penland &amp; Sardeshmukh 1995), which has been widely used to predict and simulate Pacific climate variability (e.g., Newman et al. 2011, Capotondi &amp; Sardeshmukh 2017, Lou et al. 2020, Xu et al. 2021, Capotondi et al. 2022). In Equation 3, the propagator G(τ ) can be determined empirically from the observed instantaneous and lag covariances as G(τ ) = C τ C -1 0 and has a direct relationship to the dynamical operator L = logm(G)/τ . Thus, the eigenvectors of L capture lagged feedbacks among the different components of the state vector, both locally and teleconnected, and not simply patterns maximizing the lag 0 covariances, as in traditional EOFs and principal component analysis. The eigenmodes of L constitute an empirical approximation of the dynamical modes of the system,</p>
        <p>where U is the matrix of eigenvectors [whose spatial patterns (u i ) are the ith column of U] and is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues (λ i ). Then the modes may be sorted by their decay time,</p>
        <p>The corresponding time series of each mode requires additional determination of V, the eigenvectors of L's adjoint. These are determined by V H = U -1 , such that L H V = V * , where a superscript H denotes the conjugate transpose and an asterisk denotes the conjugate. The time series is then</p>
        <p>, where v i is the ith column of V. That is, the time series of each eigenmode is obtained by projecting the data on that eigenmode's adjoint, rather than by projecting the data on the eigenmode itself, as is done when determining the time series corresponding to an EOF. Note also that, while the eigenmodes are not orthogonal, they remain independent of each other; that is, the climate state anomaly x(t ) can be reconstructed from the sum of the individual modal contributions, α i (t )u i . However, due to the modal nonorthogonality, the variance of x(t ) cannot be reconstructed as the sum of the variances of the eigenmodes, again in contrast to EOFs.</p>
        <p>For this review, we computed the eigenmodes of L using a state vector x(t ) constructed from SSTa over the Pacific region (60°E-70°W, 70°S-62°N) from three reanalysis data sets: Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) (Rayner et al. 2003), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 3b (NOAA ERSST v3b) (1950-2019) (Smith et al. 2008), and Ocean Reanalysis System 4 (ORAS4) (Balmaseda et al. 2013). Given that the computation of these eigenmodes is done through an empirical approach, the use of different data sets allows us to identify which modes are robust and how sensitive they are to the spatial and temporal resolution of the data sets and to methods used in the reanalysis. Typically, in LIM construction, data are first prefiltered to remove some noise that may impact the robustness of the computation; here, we prefilter SSTa to retain its leading 25 EOFs, defined within the specified region, and their corresponding principal component time series. Prior to the EOF, we also apply a 3-month running mean to the SSTa. For all the data sets considered, this reconstructed SSTa explains approximately 89% of the original variance:</p>
        <p>where e(s, k) represents the EOF pattern for each mode k, s is the spatial coordinate, and x(k, t ) = x(t ) is the kth principal component. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that SSTa LIMs, sometimes also augmented with sea surface height information, are generally a good forecast model on subseasonal to interannual timescales and can be used to diagnose predictability, both of itself and of operational climate global circulation models (e.g., Newman 2007Newman , 2013;;Alexander et al. 2008;Newman &amp; Sardeshmukh 2017). As a dynamical model, the LIM quantifies the impact of different processes on the system state's evolution (Newman et al. 2011).</p>
        <p>We now inspect the dominant low-frequency dynamical eigenmodes of Pacific SSTa, u i , and their temporal evolution α(t ) ordered by their e-folding timescale. Table 1 presents the decay timescales and periodicities of the eigenmodes computed from the different reanalysis products, including (Smith et al. 2008), and ORAS4. The modes are labeled 1-6 in the legend column and have been named based on their spatial expressions and color-coded in the table. Note that the actual order of the modes is not consistent in all of the data sets, and the modes were identified through correlation analysis of the spatial and temporal evolution of the modes across the data sets. Also, the modes with a finite period have conjugate pairs, which have been omitted from the an analysis of HadISST, which uses a subset of the temporal data from between 1950 and 2017 to examine the sensitivity of the modes to shorter temporal samples. After careful inspection and comparison of eigenmode structures across the data sets, we identified six robust dynamical modes, which are shown in Figure 3 by averaging the spatial structures of the modes reconstructed in each data set.</p>
        <p>The first mode captures the warming trend (Figure 3a) over the Pacific basin and is also referred to as the least damped mode (see also Frankignoul et al. 2017) since it is a stationary (i.e., nonpropagating) eigenmode with the longest decay timescale (e.g., infinite in this case). Mode 2 captures a multidecadal timescale that has projections globally (Figure 3b) and exhibits one of its centers of actions in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE). For the purposes of this review, we refer to this as the KOE eigenmode because some of the dynamics of this mode track the KOE global-scale teleconnections of PDV. Mode 3 has a decadal timescale and exhibits heavy loading in the North Pacific-central Pacific (NP-CP) regions (Figure 3c). This recurrent pattern of PDV was recently discussed as influential for the development of northeast Pacific marine heatwaves and was termed the NP-CP eigenmode because of its centers of action (Capotondi et al. 2022). Earlier, it was identified as an important contributor both to the PDO (Newman et al. 2016) and to optimal development of ENSO anomalies (Penland &amp; Sardeshmukh 1995, Newman et al. 2011, Capotondi et al. 2022). It captures the spatial expression of the two-way coupling between the tropics and extratropics (Di Lorenzo et al. 2015, Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo 2020).</p>
        <p>Next, we identified a series of higher eigenmodes that (along with the NP-CP eigenmode) track ENSO diversity: an eastern Pacific expression (EP-ENSO) (Figure 3d) with a periodicity ranging from 3 to 6 years and a central Pacific expression (CP-ENSO) (Figure 3e) with a shorter biennial periodicity that is consistent across all the data sets and in agreement with the dominant observed CP-ENSO timescale (Penland &amp; Sardeshmukh 1995, Newman et al. 2011, Capotondi et al. 2021) (see Table 1). The time series of these modes from HadISST, which has the longest coverage, are shown in Figure 3g and reveal the multidecadal nature of the KOE eigenmode, the decadal variability of the NP-CP eigenmode, and the interannual timescale of the EP-ENSO, with prominent peaks during the 1982 and 1997 El Niño events. We also found another robust eigenmode that emerges in all of the data sets, which we refer to here as the ENSO decay mode (Figure 3f ). Although this mode has not been previously described in the literature, its spatial expression is characterized by the typical projection patterns of ENSO teleconnections in the extratropics during peak El Niño events (Ashok et al. 2007, Liu &amp; Alexander 2007, Deser et al. 2017, Wang et al. 2017), suggesting that it is linked to the adjustment dynamics of the extratropics after an ENSO perturbation. The decay timescale of this mode is approximately 8 months.</p>
        <p>A close inspection of the low-frequency PDV eigenmodes that emerge from the LIM eigenanalysis reveals that the KOE and NP-CP modes very closely track the two leading global EOFs of the 8-year low-pass SSTa shown in Figure 1. This similarity provides further evidence that the KOE and NP-CP modes are the fundamental constituents of PDV. Indeed, we showed in Section 1 how a linear combination of the time series of the two global EOF modes can reconstruct much of the low-frequency variability of the IPO, NPGO, PDO, SPDO, and TPDV patterns (Figure 1e). Here, we use an alternative approach to quantify the role of the dynamical PDV eigenmodes in contributing to the patterns of the statistical modes (i.e., the IPO, PDO, SPDO, and TPDV). We used the LIM to remove (i.e., dynamically filter) the KOE and NP-CP modes and analyzed the residual variance, following the approach originally developed by Penland &amp; Matrosova (2006). Specifically, we reconstructed the SSTa field after removing the first three eigenmodes of Pacific SST, corresponding to the warming trend (i = 1), KOE (i = 2), and NP-CP (i = 3) modes, as</p>
        <p>and quantified how much of the variance of the statistical modes remains in the dynamically filtered SSTa filtered by computing regression maps of these fields with the indices of the IPO, PDO, SPDO, and TPDV (Figure 4). In Equation 6, the k index refers to the EOF structures that are used to project the eigenmodes i back into physical space s. Also note that while we refer to the KOE and NP-CP modes as i = 2 and i = 3, respectively, all of these are propagating modes that come as conjugate pairs that need to be filtered out together. With just these three PDV eigenmodes removed, the IPO standard deviation spatial structure is reduced to almost zero loading throughout the basin (Figure 4). For the TPDV pattern, the basin-scale and central tropical Pacific loadings are also significantly reduced, with most of the residual decadal variance in the tropical Pacific found in a narrow, tropically confined EP-ENSO expression. In the case of the PDO and SPDO patterns, a strong EP-ENSO expression emerges in the filtered SSTa, consistent with previous studies showing that ENSO is a key dynamical process contributing to the interannual power of these climate indices (e.g., Newman et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>While these eigenmodes emerge as the fundamental constituents of PDV, the relative importance of each eigenmode in explaining the patterns of the IPO, PDO, and SPDO can change due to internal noise and external forcing of the Pacific climate system. For example, using a stochastic numerical integration of the LIM (Equation 2) with different realizations of white noise ξ(t ) derived from the spatial structure of the noise covariance matrix ξξ T dt = -(LC 0 + C 0 L), we can easily generate O(10,000) years of SSTa, spanning the phase space of SST evolution more completely than more limited and computationally expensive Earth system model ensembles (methods described in Penland &amp; Matrosova 1994). Even within the same unforced world, there can be significant internal variability in the character and dynamical constituents of climate patterns like the PDO from one 60-year period to the next (Figure 4; the reconstruction approach is explained in Newman et al. 2016). For example, some realizations show that the PDO variance is dominated by the EP-ENSO, while in others, the KOE or NP-CP becomes more dominant, including extremes where one of the mode's expression is almost absent. Quantifying and understanding this range is key for comparing the PDV processes across Earth system models (Furtado et al. 2011, Zhao et al. 2021a). As part of this review, we are also releasing the

            <rs type="url">http://pdv-tools.org)</rs>, which was used to compute the data shown in the figures in this review (e.g., the eigenmode decomposition in Figure 3 and the dynamic filtering and stochastic simulation in Figure 4), to allow future studies to examine and compare the PDV modes across different observational and Earth system model data sets.
        </p>
        <p>In Section 3, we identified that the fundamental dynamical constituents of PDV are linked to the KOE and NP-CP modes (Figure 3b,c). We now explore the mechanisms that are important for supporting the spatial and temporal evolution of these dynamical modes.</p>
        <p>Both PDV modes (i.e., KOE and NP-CP) show that the interactions between the extratropics and the tropical Pacific play a dominant role in the basin-scale low-frequency variability. Therefore, we introduce the relevant Pacific-wide teleconnections that are mediated by the tropical Pacific and that are important for energizing and synchronizing the basin-scale PDV. We have reviewed how the spatial pattern of TPDV (Figure 4) extends beyond the tropical Pacific with a clear basinscale pattern. The primary mechanisms by which the tropical variance is exported over the Pacific basin are the ENSO teleconnections to the extratropics via atmospheric Rossby waves (e.g., the atmospheric bridge) (Hoskins &amp; Karoly 1981, Sardeshmukh &amp; Hoskins 1988, Alexander et al. 2002, Taschetto et al. 2020) and oceanic Kelvin waves (Schwing et al. 2002) along the eastern boundaries. Both teleconnection mechanisms are strongest in the boreal fall and winter, when the ENSO cycle is at its peak. Their projections on the North and South Pacific energize the basin-scale pattern of TPDV (Figure 5; the oceanic teleconnections are not represented in this schematic, and their impacts are more confined to the boundaries). While these one-way teleconnections out of the tropics have been widely documented (see also Hoerling et al. 1997, Deser et al. 2004), recent studies suggest that a two-way coupling between tropics and extratropics associated with ENSO extratropical precursors is critical for explaining PDV (Di Lorenzo et al. 2015, Stuecker 2018, Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo 2020, Lou et al. 2021).</p>
        <p>Extratropical ENSO precursor dynamics are activated by anomalies in the off-equatorial trade winds in both the South and North Pacific. The first precursors are the meridional modes (Chiang &amp; Vimont 2004, Zhang et al. 2014). First described in the context of the North Pacific seasonal footprinting mechanism (Vimont et al. 2001(Vimont et al. , 2003)), the meridional modes are associated with a reduction in the off-equatorial trades that, through the so-called wind-evaporation-SST thermodynamic feedback (Xie 1999), result in coupled ocean-atmosphere anomalies that propagate into the tropics during their growth cycle and favor ENSO conditions (Vimont et al. 2009, Vimont 2010, Martinez-Villalobos &amp; Vimont 2017). Meridional modes have been documented from both the North Pacific (Chiang &amp; Vimont 2004, Chang et al. 2007) and South Pacific (Zhang et al. 2014), appearing to act independently between the two hemispheres (Ding et al. 2015(Ding et al. , 2017;;Min et al. 2017) (Figure 5) and potentially contributing to different types of ENSO-like variability (Anderson et al. 2013a, Vimont et al. 2014, Meehl et al. 2017, You &amp; Furtado 2018, Liguori &amp; Di Lorenzo 2019). A second type of extratropical ENSO precursor is linked to modulations in the strength of the subtropical cells (Capotondi et al. 2005) and meridional heat transport into the equatorial thermocline (Anderson 2007)-a mechanism termed the trade wind-induced charging (Anderson et al. 2013b, Anderson &amp; Perez 2015). The last type of ENSO precursor is linked to the trade wind excitation of off-equatorial Rossby waves (Knutson &amp; Manabe 1998), which propagate thermocline anomalies to the equatorial western boundary. The reflection of these waves as eastward Kelvin waves along the equator is known to trigger ENSO feedbacks by modulating upwelling (e.g., the thermocline feedback) [see review by Wang (2018)].</p>
        <p>The dynamic sequence initiated by ENSO precursors (extratropics) → ENSO (tropics) → ENSO teleconnections (extratropics) (summarized in Figure 5) has been proposed as a fundamental null-hypothesis mechanism for reddening Pacific stochastic perturbations into the pattern of PDV (Di Lorenzo et al. 2015) (e.g., Figure 1d). More specifically, Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo (2020) illustrated that independent stochastic seasonal forcings of the North and South Pacific extratropical precursors, which show different patterns in the SSTa (Figure 5a, e.g., the NPMM and NPGO; Figure 5b, the SPMM), are integrated through this sequence into successor patterns (Figure 5c,d), which now exhibit the same tropically symmetric structure of the PDV pattern. In summary, this mechanism allows transferring stochastic variability from one hemisphere to the other through the ENSO bridge and projecting onto the canonical structure of the PDV pattern. This sequence mostly explains the meridional hemispherically symmetric fraction of PDV that is connected to the ENSO bridge and captures a large fraction of the TPDV in observations (∼65%) and climate models (Zhao &amp; Di Lorenzo 2020, Zhao et al. 2021a). However, TPDV has important contributions from several other sources internal to the tropics, including stochastic forcing, such as westerly wind bursts (Figure 5), teleconnections with the tropical Atlantic, and anthropogenic forcing [see review by Power et al. (2021)]. These sources also contribute to reddening the extratropics through ENSO teleconnections.</p>
        <p>Building on the two-way coupling dynamics between the tropical and extratropical Pacific, we now examine in more depth the dynamics of the NP-CP eigenmode (Figure 3c) and its contribution to the statistical patterns of variance of the known Pacific climate modes. We begin by noting that the nature of oceanic and atmospheric ENSO teleconnections from the tropics to the extratropics may depend on ENSO diversity (Capotondi et al. 2015). For example, the EP-ENSO teleconnections energize the AL and PDO patterns in the North Pacific on seasonal to interannual timescales (Newman et al. 2003, Schneider &amp; Cornuelle 2005, Vimont 2005) through the atmospheric bridge (Alexander et al. 2002) (Figure 6a, arrow 1 ) and project onto the spatial expression of the SPDO in the South Pacific (Chen &amp; Wallace 2015, Lou et al. 2019). Similarly, tropical atmospheric teleconnections associated with the CP-ENSO energize the NPO (atmosphere) and NPGO (ocean) patterns (Di Lorenzo et al. 2010) (Figure 6a, arrow 2 ) and act on the PDO on somewhat longer timescales (Newman et al. 2016, Zhao et al. 2021b).</p>
        <p>In the North Pacific, NPO variability is linked to anomalous off-equatorial trade winds, activating the extratropical precursor dynamics discussed in Section 4.1 (e.g., Knutson &amp; Manabe 1998, Vimont et al. 2001, Anderson 2003, Anderson et al. 2013b) (Figure 6a, arrow 3 ). We hypothesize that the linkages captured by the sequence NPO/NPGO/NPMM (extratropics) → CP-ENSO (tropics) → NPO/NPGO/NPMM (extratropics) (Furtado et al. 2012, Stuecker 2018) are connected to the dynamics driving the evolution of the NP-CP eigenmode. In fact, recent studies suggest that this two-way coupling between the tropical Pacific and the North Pacific is an important mechanism for supporting multiyear ENSO (Ding et al. 2022) via the sequence NPO → CP-ENSO → NPO → CP-ENSO (Figure 6a, loop 3 -2 ). Note that to the extent that these dynamics are represented by the NP-CP eigenmode, its roughly one-year memory timescale limits the predictability of this coupling process. Furthermore, given that the NPO precedes both the CPand EP-ENSO flavors, the teleconnection sequence NPO/NPGO → EP-ENSO → AL/PDO has been invoked as a key mechanism for explaining the one-year lag correlation between the expressions of the NPGO and PDO ( Joh &amp; Di Lorenzo 2017) and the persistence of multiyear climate extremes of the North Pacific such as the 2013-2015 marine heatwaves and droughts over North America (Anderson et al. 2016, Di Lorenzo &amp; Mantua 2016, Capotondi et al. 2019, Xu et al. 2021). Other studies show that the NP-CP eigenmode may be impacted by climate change, as the links between the NPO and the tropics could be intensifying under greenhouse warming (Liguori &amp; Di Lorenzo 2018) and thereby enhancing ENSO variability and amplitude ( Jia et al. 2021).</p>
        <p>Turning to the KOE eigenmode (Figure 3b), we first note that the characteristic pattern of this mode has substantial similarity to that of the NP-CP eigenmode, even though it exhibits higher loading in the KOE and South Pacific. This is again a consequence of the nonorthogonality of the dynamical eigenmodes. Indeed, despite the independence of the KOE and NP-CP modes, their time series are significantly correlated (R = 0.61, &gt;95% significance) (Figure 3g), partly due to the spatial structure of their noise forcing. In other words, these eigenmodes evolve separately on seasonal to decadal timescales but could still be linked by much faster dynamical processes, which in the LIM are approximated as white noise. To understand how the interference between these two modes contributes to PDV, we first review the large-scale climate teleconnections to and from the KOE. The oceanic adjustment of sea surface height anomalies to North Pacific basin atmospheric forcing (e.g., the AL) excites long oceanic Rossby waves that propagate into the KOE region on timescales of 2-4 years (Schneider &amp; Miller 2001, Qiu 2003, Sasaki &amp; Schneider 2011) (Figure 6b, arrow 4 ), which contribute to the PDO signal there (Newman et al. 2016). The arrival of these waves exerts a primary control on the low-frequency meridional displacement of the KOE axis (Taguchi et al. 2007). Similarly, the NPGO sea surface height anomalies propagate to the western boundary and drive low-frequency changes that project onto modulations in the KOE circulation strength (Ceballos et al. 2009, Anderson 2019) (Figure 6b, arrow 5 ). Together, the fluctuations of the KOE axis and intensity capture more than 60% of the western North Pacific PDV. Moreover, they are linked to changes in the mesoscale structure of the KOE (Qiu &amp; Chen 2005, Qiu et al. 2014), which may have important implications for large-scale air-sea interactions [see review by Kwon et al. (2010)]. Given that a fraction of the variability of the PDO and NPGO patterns is linked to the tropical Pacific (Figure 6b, arrows 1 -3 ), the lagged ocean wave teleconnection to the KOE provides a mechanism for explaining the basin-scale expression of the KOE eigenmode in the tropical Pacific.</p>
        <p>While large-scale processes drive the low-frequency variability of the KOE, the KOE in turn can drive large-scale atmospheric teleconnections that impact basin-scale variability. For example, several observationally based studies use lead/lag statistics between the KOE and the North Pacific atmosphere to suggest that low-frequency changes in the KOE can feed back into Pacific climate by triggering downstream atmospheric teleconnections in the central and eastern North Pacific (Frankignoul et al. 2011, Qiu et al. 2014, Na et al. 2018, Anderson 2019). Specifically, decadal changes in KOE oceanic forcing associated with oceanic heat content variability and changes in gyre circulations possibly alter the position and intensity of the atmospheric boundary layer (e.g., extratropical storm track) and drive the corresponding atmospheric response over the North Pacific. The reported downstream atmospheric response pattern to the Kuroshio decadal changes reveals a strong consistency across different oceanic variables of the KOE (summarized in figure 2 in Joh &amp; Di Lorenzo 2019). These feedback dynamics have been reproduced in some coupled ocean-atmosphere model experiments with sufficiently high resolution to resolve mesoscale airsea coupling in the KOE (Figure 7a) and are linked to significant changes in precipitation over North America (Smirnov et al. 2015, Ma et al. 2017, Siqueira et al. 2021) (Figure 7b).</p>
        <p>The dynamics associated with the two-way coupling in the North Pacific between the KOE and the central and eastern North Pacific (Figure 6b, arrows 4 -6 ) could energize preferred decadal timescales of variability (Qiu 2003;Qiu et al. 2007Qiu et al. , 2014) ) and may also be linked to a quasi-decadal progression of atmospheric pressure anomalies and SSTa around the North Pacific termed the Pacific Decadal Precession (Anderson et al. 2016(Anderson et al. , 2017;;Anderson 2019). A closer examination of the sea level pressure, wind stress curl, and Ekman pumping anomalies driven by the KOE atmospheric downstream response reveals that these anomalies have a strong projection on the NPO (Figure 7a) and the region of excitation of the North Pacific ENSO precursors (e.g., the and5 ). This sequence better explains the quasi-decadal timescale of the KOE/CP-ENSO spectrum that is also reported in long-term paleo-proxy observations (Nurhati et al. 2011).</p>
        <p>To better visualize the coupling between the KOE and NP-CP modes, we examine the evolution of the KOE-driven forcing sequence KOE → NPO → CP-ENSO discussed by Joh &amp; Di Lorenzo (2019) So far, we have discussed the KOE eigenmode in terms of its two-way teleconnections with the North Pacific and tropical Pacific. However, this eigenmode also has a clear expression in the South Pacific. While this expression is explained partly by the reddening of the KOE forcing through its connections to the ENSO system, the South Pacific can also act as a forcing of this pattern through the ENSO bridge on low-frequency timescales (Garreaud &amp; Battisti 1999).</p>
        <p>We have already discussed that the SPMM dynamics triggered by the SPO wind anomalies can energize the ENSO system and TPDV pattern. Some studies suggest that the SPMM has stronger influences on the tropical Pacific on decadal versus interannual timescales. Sensitivity simulations with an ensemble of coupled climate models suggest that while the NPMM energizes the CP-ENSO pattern on interannual timescales, the SPMM energizes the decadal variance of the EP-ENSO (Liguori &amp; Di Lorenzo 2019). Furthermore, other studies have pointed out that the off-equatorial winds from the South Pacific also have a direct path to the eastern tropical Pacific and can lead to ocean low-frequency variance through a simple integration (i.e., the AR-1 model shown in Equation 1) of the atmospheric variability (Okumura 2013). Collectively, these processes from the South Pacific may energize the KOE eigenmode.</p>
        <p>This review has highlighted evidence for a modified paradigm of the interactions of various modes of PDV and how the important mechanisms at play in the ocean-atmosphere system basin-wide may yield this variability. The dominant statistical modes of basin-scale PDV, such as the IPO and TPDV, are linked and explain a large fraction of the global low-frequency variability in SSTa (Section 2; Figure 1). The extratropical SSTa patterns of PDV over the North and South Pacific, variously defined as the PDO, SPDO, NPGO, NPMM, and SPMM, are also linked to the global SSTa decadal-scale variability. Their patterns can be explained to first order by a reddening of the atmospheric forcing that arises from a shift and/or intensification and weakening of the atmospheric mean circulation's pressure systems (Section 2.1; Figure 2). At low frequencies, all statistical modes of Pacific climate converge to an ENSO-like pattern of TPDV (Section 2.2), highlighting the important role of ENSO dynamics as a bridge to establish the basin-scale PDV.</p>
        <p>While the description of PDV from the statistical modes is useful to track the state of Pacific climate and its impacts on weather and marine ecosystems, it does not explicitly resolve the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections or the coupled feedbacks, which are important for understanding PDV. For this reason, we used the LIM Climate Diagnostic Toolbox for PDV (developed for this review and available at http://pdv-tools.org) to empirically reconstruct the dynamical operator of Pacific climate and its eigenmodes using a reduced observation space (Section 3.1). After extracting the leading LIM eigenmodes from three reanalysis products-HadISST, NOAA ERSST v3b, and ORAS4 (Sections 3.2 and 3.3; Figure 3; Table 1)-we showed that the spatial patterns of variance of PDV (e.g., the IPO, PDO, and TPDV) result from the interaction of the two lowest-frequency dynamical eigenmodes, the KOE and NP-CP eigenmodes (Figure 4). The spatial structure of these two eigenmodes is basin-scale and depicts that two-way teleconnection dynamics between the tropics and extratropics associated with the sequence ENSO precursors (extratropics) → ENSO (tropics) → ENSO teleconnections (extratropics) (Section 4.1; Figure 5) are the fundamental mechanisms to energize and synchronize the basin-scale footprint of PDV. More specifically, the NP-CP eigenmode captures interannual-to decadal-scale variability and energizes the variance of the NPO/NPGO (extratropics) → CP-ENSO (tropics) → NPO/NPGO (extratropics) sequence (Section 4.2; Figure 6). The KOE eigenmode exhibits a basin-scale structure that resembles the IPO and is characterized by decadal to multidecadal timescales. It tracks the two-way teleconnections of the KOE with the central and eastern North Pacific associated with the propagation of Rossby ocean waves into the KOE and the air-sea feedback response of the KOE onto the downstream atmospheric circulation of the North Pacific. This downstream response couples the KOE eigenmode to the NP-CP by activating the ENSO extratropical precursors and leads to a multiannual preferred timescale of variability linked to the sequence KOE → NPO → CP-ENSO → NPO/NPGO → KOE (Section 4.3; Figure 6).</p>
        <p>Although the NP-CP mode emerges as an oscillatory eigenmode, its period is much longer than its decay timescale (Table 1). This implies that it is unlikely that a sustained oscillation of this eigenmode will ever be observed. Therefore, while the eigenmode captures the dynamical sequences summarized here, these sequences will only be predictable over some finite period until they eventually become entirely obscured by noise events that are largely unpredictable.</p>
        <p>While this synthesis has highlighted some of the dynamical modes and mechanisms of PDV across various reanalysis products, we must recognize that these observational sources are still relatively short in total period of record, which introduces some uncertainties in our ability to cleanly resolve the modes and diagnose their mechanisms. It also remains unclear how nonstationarity in the data and in the projections for future climate influences the expression of the dynamical modes. Furthermore, we have shown through stochastic simulations of the LIM (Section 3.4) that different realizations of Pacific climate from the same dynamical operator can lead to substantial differences in the relative importance that each mode plays in explaining the statistical patterns of PDV, such as the PDO. Acknowledging and quantifying this range of uncertainty is critical for analyzing and comparing Earth system models and assessing the significance of changes in the PDV dynamics related to anthropogenic forcing, which we have not addressed in this review. Future studies may want to use the LIM diagnostic approach to explore PDV in a changing climate.</p>
