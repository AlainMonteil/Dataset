        <p>Ensemble flood forecasting has gained significant momentum over the past decade due to the growth of ensemble numerical weather and climate prediction, expansion in high performance computing, growing interest in shifting from deterministic to risk-based decision-making that accounts for forecast uncertainty, and the efforts of communities such as the international Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX), which focuses on advancing relevant ensemble forecasting capabilities and fostering its adoption. With this shift, comes the need to understand the current state of ensemble flood forecasting, in order to provide insights into current capabilities and areas for improvement, thus identifying future research opportunities to allow for better allocation of research resources. In this paper, we provide an overview of current research activities in ensemble flood forecasting and discuss knowledge gaps and future research opportunities, based on a review of 70 papers focussing on various aspects of ensemble flood forecasting around the globe. Future research directions include opportunities to improve technical aspects of ensemble flood forecasting, such as data assimilation techniques and methods to account for more sources of uncertainty, and developing ensemble forecasts for more variables, for example flood inundation, by applying techniques such as machine learning. Further to this, we conclude that there is a need to not only improve technical aspects of flood forecasting, but also to bridge the gap between scientific research and hydro-meteorological model development, and real-world flood management using probabilistic ensemble forecasts, especially through effective communication.Ensemble flood forecasting has gained significant momentum over the past decade due to the growth of ensemble numerical weather and climate prediction, expansion in high performance computing, growing interest in shifting from deterministic to risk-based decision-making that accounts for forecast uncertainty, and the efforts of communities such as the international Hydrologic Ensemble Prediction Experiment (HEPEX), which focuses on advancing relevant ensemble forecasting capabilities and fostering its adoption.

        <p>Flood modelling and forecasting is key to managing and preparing for extreme flood events. According to the international disaster database, flooding occurs more frequently than all other types of natural hazards across the globe, and accounts for 39% of all disasters arising from natural hazards since 2000, with &gt;94 million people affected worldwide every year (Guha-Sapir et al., 2018). The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) estimates that while economic losses caused by flooding have increased over the past fifty years, loss of life has significantly decreased due to improved monitoring and forecasting of hydro-meteorological hazards (WMO, 2015).Flood modelling and forecasting is key to managing and preparing for extreme flood events.

        <p>There exists a wide range of techniques used for forecasting flood events, the majority of which use precipitation data as input, be this from upstream observations, or precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems or rain field extrapolations. Precipitation and temperature forecasts are key in predicting river flow and flooding , particularly for lead times of more than 1-2 days (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009). Many of the flood forecasting approaches, however, provide a deterministic forecast, i.e. a single forecast scenario of the future state, with little or no defensible estimate of the uncertainty in the forecast. Over the past 2 -3 decades, meteorological NWP has moved from deterministic forecasting to probabilistic forecasting using ensemble prediction systems (EPS), and in the past decade, ensemble forecasting has also become increasingly available for hydrometeorological flood forecasting purposes across the globe (Emerton et al., 2016;Pappenberger et al., 2016). Ensemble flood forecasts can provide an indication of the potential of upcoming extreme events, and the risk of damages associated with them. Despite a range of scientific and institutional challenges associated with moving to operational ensemble forecasting for flood management (Arnal et al., 2019), the benefits of ensemble forecasts over deterministic forecasts have been argued by a number of recent analyses (Rossa et al., 2011;Siddique et al. 2017;Verkada and Werner, 2011;Pappenberger et al., 2015).There exists a wide range of techniques used for forecasting flood events, the majority of which use precipitation data as input, be this from upstream observations, or precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems or rain field extrapolations.

        <p>In hydrological forecasting, the four key sources of uncertainty are the input data, model structure, model parameters and evaluation data for model validation (Kauffeldt, A., 2014;Shaw et al., 2011;Wood and Lettenmaier, 2008;Pagano et al., 2013), and their superposition (Zappa et al., 2011). For forecasts beyond 2-3 days ahead, the largest uncertainty stems from the meteorological forecast input (He et al., 2009;Emerton et al., 2016) (except for special circumstances, such as seasonal forecast involving snow melting). Ensemble forecasts allow for representation of the forecast uncertainty by producing a range (or ensemble) of possible forecast outcomes, each of which is equally probable. This is done by applying small perturbations to the initial state of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Due to the chaotic nature of the atmosphere (Lorenz 1963), these small perturbations lead to significantly varying outcomes with increasing lead time. In addition, many forecasting centres include stochastic physics in their EPS, applying perturbations to the parameterised physical processes, to additionally represent the uncertainty associated with these parameterisations (Buizza et al., 1999).In hydrological forecasting, the four key sources of uncertainty are the input data, model structure, model parameters and evaluation data for model validation (Kauffeldt, A., 2014;Shaw et al., 2011;Wood and Lettenmaier, 2008;Pagano et al., 2013), and their superposition (Zappa et al., 2011).

        <p>In flood forecasting, probabilistic river flow predictions are typically produced by using an ensemble precipitation forecast to force a hydrological model (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009;Pagano et al., 2013;Clark and Hay, 2004;Cloke et al., 2013). The ensemble nature of the forecast provides usable probabilistic information about flood events on much longer lead times than has previously been possible for deterministic forecasts (Emerton et al, 2016), and is useful in catchments where no other input data is available (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009). Even so, many the latest operational ensemble flood forecasting systems do not additionally account for uncertainty in the hydrological model; as such, the spread of the forecasts is typically under-dispersive (Wang et al., 2009), not accounting for the full range of uncertainty throughout the modelling chain. This remains a grand challenge in ensemble flood forecasting and an active area of current research. Cloke and Pappenberger (2009) investigated the scientific and technical drivers behind the shift from deterministic to ensemble flood forecasting, and highlighted seven challenges in this shift, from computing resources and limited sample sizes of extreme events to communicating uncertainty. As ensemble prediction systems have continued to increase in both number and quality, and decisionmaking for flood events has begun to move from deterministic to probabilistic (Hall et al., 2008;Bruen et al., 2010), we discuss current research activities in the area of ensemble flood forecasting and their evolution over the past decade. We further highlight current knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research in order to improve ensemble flood forecasting and its use in water management.In flood forecasting, probabilistic river flow predictions are typically produced by using an ensemble precipitation forecast to force a hydrological model (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009;Pagano et al., 2013;Clark and Hay, 2004;Cloke et al., 2013).

        <p>The publication years of the selected papers are summarised in Figure B1 and the origins of these studies are summarised in Figure B2. There is an remarkable increase in publications in the research field over the past decade. The first publication fitting the search criteria appeared in 2001. In the following five years, there was only one publication in 2003. Since 2007 however, the number of papers published started to increase. Although varied across the years, the general increasing trend in the number of publications is evident. This observation agrees with the increasing awareness of flood risk and the needs to consider uncertainty in flood forecasting in recent years (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009;Rossa et al., 2011) and the fact that many countries started to provide global ensemble NWP products around that time (Pappenberger et al., 2016). Despite the overall increase in the number of studies over the years, most of these studies were conducted in countries located in the northern hemisphere or in the developed world. European countries account for nearly half of the papers reviewed, followed by Asia and North America; while there is no study from Africa. This is generally in line with the origins of NWP ensemble products, which are the ultimate input for ensemble flood forecasting models.The publication years of the selected papers are summarised in Figure B1 and the origins of these studies are summarised in Figure B2.

        <p>The study focus of the papers was reviewed and the papers were categorised into those focusing on ensemble modelling, ensemble utilisation, and ensemble application, as shown in Figure 1. Over half of the studies focus on the application of ensemble input for flood modelling (using either climate or hydrological models), including the development of ensemble flood models, the comparison of different ensemble products and feasibility studies examining the suitability of specific EPS to be used at specific locations of interest. This is especially the case for papers published during the early half of the review period (i.e. prior to 2010), when there are only 2 papers on technical topics related to ensemble modelling (i.e. data assimilation) and 3 papers on the application of ensemble forecasts to solve realworld problems (i.e. developing flood warning systems). During the second half of the review period, the overall number of papers in the field has increased significantly, especially on ensemble modelling and application. During this period, papers focusing on topics related to ensemble modelling have extended to cover ensemble generation and post-processing of ensemble forecasts; while the number of papers focusing on ensemble flood forecasting for the development of flood warning systems has increased from 3 to 10, and the application topics have been extended to cover reservoir operation and flood risk analysis.The study focus of the papers was reviewed and the papers were categorised into those focusing on ensemble modelling, ensemble utilisation, and ensemble application, as shown in Figure 1.

        <p>As can be seen in Figure 2, prior to 2010 most of the case study systems are from the northern hemisphere, including 9 (or 53%) from Europe and 6 (35%) from Asia. There is one case study system (6%) each from Africa and Oceania during this period. Although still dominated by the northern hemisphere, the geographic distribution of the case study systems changed in the second half of the study period, with Asia leading with a total of 22 systems (41%) being investigated, followed by 17 case studies (31%) from Europe and 11 (20%) from North America. Further to this, there are also case studies from South America, and a global study. During the early stages of research on ensemble flood forecasting, most of the studies focused on floods in rural catchments, as shown in Figure 3, with rural flood events accounting for 94% of those investigated between 2001 and 2010. More recently, the scope of ensemble flood forecasting has extended to include other types of floods, such as flooding in urban areas (an increase from one case study between 2001 and 2010 to 11 between 2011 and 2019), flash floods (an increase from zero to 14) and compound floods (defined as a flood caused by a combination of events, such as tidal flooding and intense rainfall") (an increase from zero to 2). The increase in the flash flood studies is likely to be related to a special issue on the topic published in 2016 (Braud et al., 2016) The change in the types of flood investigated also resulted in changes in the spatial scale of flooding investigated. As shown in Figure 4, although floods occurring on catchment or basin scale are the focus in both time periods, floods on a local scale have become more popular in the past decade. This is mainly due to increased research on urban floods, which affect a relatively small area. It should also be noted that one of the studies on catchment/basin-scale floods during the second half of the review period investigated river basins from around the world, (Figure 2). In addition, compound floods were not considered until more recently, beginning in 2017, due to increased awareness of compound events in recent years (Leonard et al., 2014;Zscheischler et al., 2018); this is also an emerging area for flood modelling.As can be seen in Figure 2, prior to 2010 most of the case study systems are from the northern hemisphere, including 9 (or 53%) from Europe and 6 (35%) from Asia.

        <p>Compared to the types and spatial scales of floods investigated, there are less significant changes in the temporal resolution of the flood events (i.e. the frequency of flood forecasts produced) investigated over the years. For both time periods before and after 2010, sub-daily flood data (e.g. hourly, 3-hourly or 6hourly) were used in most of the studies (compared to daily flood data). There is a slight shift from daily data to sub-daily flood data after 2010, which is probably again due to the shift in the types of floods investigated and improved data availability in recent years. Urban floods have a relatively shorter duration (i.e. the length of the flood event) and event onset time (i.e. the response time between the storm and the beginning of the flood event) and therefore lead time (some are classified as flash floods with a lead time less than 6 hours). As a result, urban floods are often investigated with sub-daily data. In addition, very short (i.e. lead time less than 24 hours) to medium range (i.e. lead time of 3-15 days) flood forecasts are the focus of ensemble flood forecasting for both pre-and post-2010 periods, as shown in Figure 6. Only 5 studies considered lead time longer than two weeks, with 4 of these studies were conducted after 2010.Compared to the types and spatial scales of floods investigated, there are less significant changes in the temporal resolution of the flood events (i.e. the frequency of flood forecasts produced) investigated over the years.

        <p>Various flood models have been used in the studies to forecast different types of flood variables, as summarised in Figures 7 and8. Hydrological models simulating rainfall-runoff relationships are the most commonly used flood models in the studies investigated, especially during the first half of the review period with hydrological models accounting for 76% of the studies reviewed. Consequently, river flow is the most common flood variable predicted (Figure 8). During the second half of the review period, although hydrological modelling is still a popular approach, a variety of other flood models were also considered, such as hydraulic models and data-driven models. This also related to the increase in the type of flood variables being considered, -with flood water levels, rainfall (as a surrogate of flood severity) and flood inundation area. Fluvial or pluvial flooding driven by rainfall are the most common flood processes considered during both review periods (Figure 9). In the second review period, research was extended to include other flood driving mechanisms, including ocean processes such as storm tide and storm surge, and meteorological conditions such as temperature, air pressure, humidity and wind, which are typically used in machine-learning models to forecast floods affected by these variables (e.g. snow melt driven floods), and catastrophic events such as dam failure. The ocean process is often included using a hydraulic model; whereas meteorological conditions are often incorporated through a numerical weather model or a data-driven modelling approach. It should be noted that in the papers reviewed, there is only one study that considered floods caused by dam failure, and floods due to groundwater events or glacial lake are not considered.Various flood models have been used in the studies to forecast different types of flood variables, as summarised in Figures 7 and8.

        <p>As discussed previously, ensemble forecasts can be generated using a variety of different methods. In the studies reviewed, four key methods were typically used, including multi-model-based ensembles, initial/boundary condition perturbations, parameterisation of models, and statistical approaches to account for error, as shown in Figure 10. Initial or boundary condition perturbation is the most commonly-used method for ensemble generation. This is due to the use of ensemble NWP products, many of which are generated using this method, in order to account for the chaotic nature of the atmosphere (Lorenz, 1963).As discussed previously, ensemble forecasts can be generated using a variety of different methods.

        <p>Research focussing on evaluation of ensemble forecasts adopts a variety of methods, as shown in Figure 11. Ad hoc methods based on visual inspection or the ensemble mean are the most commonly used methods, followed by threshold-based methods such as estimating the probability of detection compared to observed data. Whereas distribution-based methods accounting for all ensemble members were only used in 3 studies before 2010. Although this number has increased to 22 for the period after 2010, ad hoc methods are still the dominant methods used in the second half of the review period. In a small number of studies (4 for pre-2010 and 11 for post-2010 periods) only ad hoc methods were used.Research focussing on evaluation of ensemble forecasts adopts a variety of methods, as shown in Figure 11.

        <p>In both review periods, the majority of studies were based on ensemble forecasts using ensemble sizes ranging from 10 ensemble members to 100, as shown in Figure 12. This is directly related to the ensemble NWP products used. There are, in total, 4 studies using forecasts with over 100 ensemble members. All of these studies focused on analysis of input uncertainty, with two studies also considering uncertainty from inputs generated using different climate models. In the second half of the review period, the number of ensemble members was not mentioned in 10 studies. In summary, the review has highlighted that there are an increasing number of studies investigating ensemble flood forecasting. The majority studies have focussed on ensemble forecasting of flooding associated with fluvial processes at the catchment-scale for lead times of up to 15 days. There is considerable emphasis in the reviewed studies on forecasting river flows using hydrological models and ensemble members generated using perturbed forcing. Emerging areas of research tend to focus on extending ensemble forecasting methods to predict a wider range of variables, different types of events and to longer lead times, and the use of ensemble forecasts. These emerging research areas are identifying numerous challenges and research opportunities. Technical challenges are related to extending ensemble forecasting methods include the additional data and computational requirements, and the need for innovative modelling, ensemble generation and forecast evaluation approaches. There are also outstanding challenges related to how ensemble forecasts can be used to inform real-world management of and responses to flooding.

        <p>From the review outcomes discussed, we can see that although the overall number of studies on ensemble flood forecasting has increased significantly in the last decade, this increase is not uniform across the different categories reviewed. For example, it varies with the geographic focus of the study, types of floods forecast, and ensemble modelling and evaluation methods used. This is partially due to the quality and availability of observational data. It is also because ensemble forecasting is a relatively new concept in flood-related management applications, although it has been a research focus over the past 2-3 decades in hydro-meteorological modelling. In the following section, we summarise some of the areas for future focus and consideration in the ensemble flood forecasting research and practise communities, including:From the review outcomes discussed, we can see that although the overall number of studies on ensemble flood forecasting has increased significantly in the last decade, this increase is not uniform across the different categories reviewed.

        <p>All forecasts, whether ensemble or deterministic, are dependent on observational data of high quality for all parts of the flood forecasting chain. Data acquisition for forecasts has undergone rapid and fundamental changes in recent decades with the rise of remote sensing and new types of data, but has at the same time confronted a decline of traditional observations (Dutra et al., 2014). This poses new opportunities as well as new challenges for the forecasting systems with regards to having the best possible input for hydrometeorological forecasting.All forecasts, whether ensemble or deterministic, are dependent on observational data of high quality for all parts of the flood forecasting chain.

        <p>There are three main sources for observational data used in hydrometeorological forecasting around the globe; 1) observations from ground-based gauges, 2) remote sensing and 3) modelled reanalysis (Michaelides, 2009). For some areas, ground-based radar can also be used for some variables, such as wind speed and precipitation.There are three main sources for observational data used in hydrometeorological forecasting around the globe; 1) observations from ground-based gauges, 2) remote sensing and 3) modelled reanalysis (Michaelides, 2009).

        <p>Conventional observational data from in situ measurement stations are still the backbone to use in model construction, calibration and validation of hydrometeorological forecasts when they are available and of sufficient quality. However, the global decrease in the number of observational measuring stations in the last decade (Lins, 2008) is especially troublesome when it comes to non-stationarity in observations due to climate change, and the ability to calibrate and validate hydrological models.Conventional observational data from in situ measurement stations are still the backbone to use in model construction, calibration and validation of hydrometeorological forecasts when they are available and of sufficient quality.

        <p>Another major challenge for observational data is the lack of metadata (i.e. information about the data), which hinders the assessments of uncertainty. Location, measuring method, type of instrumentation are all variables that contributes to the uncertainty. Further, variables such as river discharge are very often derived from another primary variable, which in effect adds to the uncertainty of the observation.Another major challenge for observational data is the lack of metadata (i.e. information about the data), which hinders the assessments of uncertainty.

        <p>A problem that is not related to the uncertainty in the actual observation, is the representativity of the data point. Hydrological modelling most often requires spatial fields of forcing data, and these fields are interpolated to continuous fields from point observations with the assumptions of being spatially coherent. This is a problem especially for precipitation, which is highly variable in space and time, also with regards to the field correlation in space and time.A problem that is not related to the uncertainty in the actual observation, is the representativity of the data point.

        <p>Conventional observation stations are declining in numbers (Lins, 2008). However, automation means that the data collected is available in real-time and with a lot more metadata compared to manually managed stations. An important aspect of observational data collection is to agree on standards for preserving metadata, such as European Commissions INSPIRE directive, which started in 2007(INSPIRE, 2019). Making sure that all the available information about the data is preserved is time-consuming. Protocols for data exchange, thereby homogenizing data formats, is critical to sharing data across geographical regions and technical platforms. While updating measuring stations is expensive, and could lead to a sparser network of observations, the higher quality of data obtained could mean that the data is more useful for forecasting. It is worth noting that the majority of these observation stations are located in the developed world; whereas the large parts of the developing world are rarely covered. How to improve observational data collection globally remains a critical challenge.Conventional observation stations are declining in numbers (Lins, 2008).

        <p>Remotely sensed data, mainly from satellites, has become more and more important as source of information in hydrology (McCabe, 2017). The main advantage is that it contains an abundance of information, but it needs to be calibrated, thinned and quality controlled before it can be used in applications. This often requires observational data of good quality for calibration and validation of the remotely sensed data, therefore this is not independent of ground-based observational point data.Remotely sensed data, mainly from satellites, has become more and more important as source of information in hydrology (McCabe, 2017).

        <p>Drawbacks of satellite data are that they are sometimes blocked, the coarse spatial resolution, the blocking and the intermittent fly-over of polar-orbiting satellites. However, recent years have seen an increase in small, cheap satellites to complement the larger programmes, making more data available (McCabe, 2017). Ground-based weather radars have proven to give very good spatial coverage of precipitation and can, through calibration, be used for both near-real-time observations and nowcasting (Ross et al. 2011).Drawbacks of satellite data are that they are sometimes blocked, the coarse spatial resolution, the blocking and the intermittent fly-over of polar-orbiting satellites.

        <p>As the output is model-generated, it will suffer from model biases and drifts over time, and the water budget may not be closed (Kauffeld et al., 2015).

These short comings can be adjusted for through post-processing (Maraun et al, 2010), however this also requires good quality observational data(C3S, 2017).As the output is model-generated, it will suffer from model biases and drifts over time, and the water budget may not be closed (Kauffeld et al., 2015).

        <p>Opportunities for the future lie in developing hybrid systems, mixing conventional observational data, delivering high quality, high frequency data, with remotely sensed data (Beck et al, 2017a). In a sense, this is what is being done in a reanalysis product, but the drawback of using these systems in operational forecasting has been the low resolution and model bias. However, using the uncertainty inherent in the observations and models can also open the door to ensemble methods in initial conditions of hydrometeorological forecasts.Opportunities for the future lie in developing hybrid systems, mixing conventional observational data, delivering high quality, high frequency data, with remotely sensed data (Beck et al, 2017a).

        <p>The majority of flood forecasting systems reviewed here predict river flows within defined river channels. Systems either display little hydrological regulation (Liechti et al., 2013) or neglect the effects of regulation times of flooding (Ushiyama et al., 2014;Yu et al., 2018). The studies generally focus on meso-scale catchments where the interactions between antecedent catchment conditions and forecast weather are both important and there are multiple different methods of producing forecasts with similar performance. At the centre of most of these systems is a model that transforms rainfall to river flow, but the characteristics of these models vary widely from physically based and conceptual hydrological models (Thiemig et al., 2015;Verbunt et al., 2007) to machine learning methods (Kimura et al., 2016;Tiwari and Chatterjee, 2010).The majority of flood forecasting systems reviewed here predict river flows within defined river channels.

        <p>Reducing errors in riverine flood forecasts has been an ongoing research challenge since the advent of hydrological forecasting (O'Connell and Clarke, 1981) and remains outstanding. Errors in flood forecasts are most commonly reduced by assimilating streamflow data to update state variables (Srikanthan et al., 2008) or applying a statistical method to post-process predictions (Yu et al., 2015). Increasingly, studies are investigating the assimilation of remotely sensed observations, such as soil moisture, to update model state variables in flood forecasting models and reduce forecast errors (Li et al., 2016). The advantage of assimilating observations of variables other than streamflow is that they can provide additional information on the partitioning updates between the different state variables and potentially improve the skill of forecasts at long lead times. However, there are outstanding research challenges in how best to relate remotely sensed observations to the state variables of hydrological models and the most effective strategy for assimilation (Li et al., 2016).Reducing errors in riverine flood forecasts has been an ongoing research challenge since the advent of hydrological forecasting (O'Connell and Clarke, 1981) and remains outstanding.

        <p>More recent studies report on forecasting of flash floods. Various definitions of flash flooding exist (Hapuarachchi et al., 2011), but common to all definitions is a short time lag between intense rainfall and a flood peak. Flash floods occur when river flow reacts very rapidly to intense rainfall. They typically occur over limited spatial extents, in areas of steep slopes, and shallow or saturated soils (Liechti et al., 2013). Many of the flash flood forecasting studies reported extend riverine forecasting methods by introducing more accurate precipitation nowcasts (Marty et al., 2013) or some form of improved data assimilation (Chen et al., 2013). However, flash flooding also occurs in urban areas (Einfalt et al., 2009) and in rural landscapes away from riverine channels, but ensemble forecasting methods of these types of floods are not widely reported. This may be due to limitations on the availability of data or that methods for generating flash flood forecasts need to be refined to reflect the dominant processes involved.More recent studies report on forecasting of flash floods.

        <p>Accurately forecasting flash flooding is an intrinsically difficult problem requiring the prediction of high rainfall intensities in the precise location where it occurs.

        <p>While flash flooding predominantly is a pluvial process, the land surface hydrology can modulate the transformation of precipitation to runoff and hence the extend of flooding. To represent the effects of land surface hydrology on flash floods, hydrological modelling needs to be undertaken at fine spatial resolutions to better represent the processes that lead to flash flooding (Antonetti et al., 2019). There are many outstanding research challenges with hyper-resolution hydrological modelling, particularly with respect to the characterisation of hydrological process, availability of high-resolution observations and growth in computational requirements as model resolution increases (Bierkens et al., 2015).While flash flooding predominantly is a pluvial process, the land surface hydrology can modulate the transformation of precipitation to runoff and hence the extend of flooding.

        <p>The majority of flood forecasting systems reviewed here predict river flow as their main output variable, yet there are an increasing number of studies describing models predicting other flood variables, such as inundation and water levels. Typically, producing forecasts of inundation and water levels requires the use of a hydraulic model in addition to a rainfall-runoff model. This adds another layer of uncertainty to the forecasting chain, due to localised variations in river channels and floodplain geometry that must be parameterised using observed data, which can be limited (Boelee et al. 2017). A key challenge and limitation in terms of providing robust forecasts of flood inundation that appropriately represent the forecast uncertainty, is the computer power required to run multiple simulations of both a hydrological and hydraulic model (Pappenberger et al. 2005), alongside the accuracy of the rainfall forecasts used as input to the models. Teng et al. (2017) state that "despite active research in the field, rapid and accurate flood modelling at high spatial-temporal resolutions remains a significant challenge in hydrologic and hydraulic studies". While significant progress has been made, with current state-of-the-art 2D and 3D hydrodynamic models able to accurately simulate flood inundation, alongside velocity and water level, these require extensive computing resources and are typically only run for small catchments, particularly at high resolutions.

Simplified, often 1D, versions are less computationally expensive, but have limitations in the simulation of flood waves and the representation of topography (Teng et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>There exists a huge range of flood inundation models, from those using empirical methods to physicallybased hydrodynamic models, and various studies (Neels and Pender, 2013; Teng et al., 2017) have indicated that the differences in the predictions from these various approaches only serves to highlight the significant uncertainty we still face in flood prediction, and the importance of employing ensemble prediction techniques.There exists a huge range of flood inundation models, from those using empirical methods to physicallybased hydrodynamic models, and various studies (Neels and Pender, 2013; Teng et al., 2017) have indicated that the differences in the predictions from these various approaches only serves to highlight the significant uncertainty we still face in flood prediction, and the importance of employing ensemble prediction techniques.</p>
        <p>While a key challenge in ensemble forecasts of flood inundation lies in the computer power required, which imposes limits on producing ensemble inundation forecasts in real-time, recent research (e.g. Chu et al., 2019) has begun to evaluate the use of emulation models, including those developed using machine learning techniques, for flood inundation forecasting. The application of such techniques to flood inundation forecasting is a recent and developing area of research. While challenges still remain (Chu et al.,2019), there is potential for such models to be used in real-time forecasting by significantly reducing computation time.While a key challenge in ensemble forecasts of flood inundation lies in the computer power required, which imposes limits on producing ensemble inundation forecasts in real-time, recent research (e.g. Chu et al., 2019) has begun to evaluate the use of emulation models, including those developed using machine learning techniques, for flood inundation forecasting.

        <p>An important recent advance and ongoing area of research is the use of remote sensing techniques to improve the accuracy of flood models (Li et al., 2016;Li et al., 2018). Remote sensing data can be used to calibrate and validate flood inundation models (Dasgupta et al., 2019), and in future will likely be integrated into the modelling chain. One key way to incorporate and benefit from new, real-time datasets is through data assimilation, which is commonly used in meteorological ensemble forecasting, but currently less frequently used within hydrological (or hydraulic) modelling (Emerton et al., 2016).An important recent advance and ongoing area of research is the use of remote sensing techniques to improve the accuracy of flood models (Li et al., 2016;Li et al., 2018).

        <p>Recent advances in hydrodynamic modelling alongside computing (e.g. parallel computing, open source code) have led to vast improvements in flood inundation modelling. With ongoing research and model development it will become more common for variables beyond river flow, such as inundation and water level, which are directly related to flood impacts, to be included in ensemble flood forecasts (Cooten et al., 2011;Georgas et al., 2016;Gomez et al., 2019). This is particularly promising in the near future with forecasting services worldwide moving more and more towards the provision of impactbased forecasts (WMO, 2018). Ensemble forecasts of flood inundation would allow for a better representation of uncertainty when considering exposure, vulnerability and risk associated with a forecasted event.Recent advances in hydrodynamic modelling alongside computing (e.g. parallel computing, open source code) have led to vast improvements in flood inundation modelling.

        <p>The papers reviewed in this study have mostly focused on short-to medium-range ensemble forecasts of flood events. However, earlier indications of potential flood events, many weeks or even months in advance, could provide crucial information for flood preparedness and disaster risk reduction. A key area of ongoing and future research in hydrological ensemble prediction is that of extending the lead time of flood forecasts to sub-seasonal scales (Bennett et al., 2014). Many operational forecasting centres produce seasonal forecasts of meteorological variables, which are often averaged into "seasonal-mean" estimates of climate, such as whether the coming season will be warmer or cooler than usual (Weisheimer and Palmer, 2014). The equivalent long-range forecasts for hydrological variables can also provide crucial information for flood preparedness and mitigation (Yuan et al., 2015a). Indeed, the use of seasonal probabilistic and ensemble hydro-meteorological forecasting systems for water management has a long history. The first seasonal-scale ensemble streamflow forecasts were introduced in the mid-1970s (Wood et al, 2016;Day, 1985), and were used to support seasonal volumetric inflows and daily sequences for managing reservoirs. These forecasts are currently implemented operationally at regional to national scales in numerous countries. Improving seasonal forecasts remains an active and ongoing area of research, from local (Mendoza et al, 2017) to regional (Bell et al., 2017;Bennett et al., 2016;Crochemore et al., 2016;Meißner et al., 2017;Mo et al., 2014;Prudhomme et al., 2017;Wood et al., 2002Wood et al., , 2005;;Yuan et al., 2013) and global (Candogan Yossef et al., 2017;Yuan et al., 2015b) scales.The papers reviewed in this study have mostly focused on short-to medium-range ensemble forecasts of flood events.

        <p>In recent years, several operational continental-scale seasonal hydro-meteorological forecasting systems have been launched, using meteorological forecasts as input to hydrological models to produce seasonal forecasts of hydrological variables. Some examples of operational seasonal forecasts of hydrological variables include: the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) European Flood Awareness System (EFAS; Arnal et al., 2018;Cloke et al., 2013) and Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS, Emerton et al., 2018), the European Service for Water Indicators in Climate Change Adaptation (SWICCA; Copernicus, 2018), the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts (Bennett et al., 2017;BoM, 2018) and the USA's Advanced Hydrological Prediction Service (AHPS; McEnery et al, 2005) and Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast Service (HEFS; Demargne et al., 2014;Emerton et al., 2016).In recent years, several operational continental-scale seasonal hydro-meteorological forecasting systems have been launched, using meteorological forecasts as input to hydrological models to produce seasonal forecasts of hydrological variables.

        <p>Despite the chaotic nature of the atmosphere (Lorenz, 1963), which introduces a limit of weather event predictability, seasonal climate predictions are possible as they rely on components that vary on longer timescales, known as "second type predictability" (Lorenz, 1993). In the seasonal hydrological forecasting context, predictability comes from the inertia or climatological evolution of initial conditions and a lesser amount of predictability arising from large-scale modes of climate variability (Emerton et al., 2018;Wood and Lettenmaier, 2008). Various patterns of climate variability, and their associated teleconnections, influence river flow and flooding across the globe, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Chiew and McMahon, 2002;Emerton et al., 2017;Guimarães Nobre et al., 2017;Ward et al., 2014aWard et al., , 2014bWard et al., , 2016)), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Southern Oscillation (SOI), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Yuan et al., 2015b). As such, they are able to contribute to the seasonal predictability of hydrological variables. Coupled atmosphere-ocean-land or earth system models (ESMs) "are key in representing these large-scale modes of climate variability in order to produce seasonal hydro-meteorological forecasts" (Emerton et al., 2018), along with empirical forecast models relating climate system states to surface climate, and in recent years, hybrid approach combining dynamical and empirical approaches (e.g. Weisheimer and Palmer, 2014).Despite the chaotic nature of the atmosphere (Lorenz, 1963), which introduces a limit of weather event predictability, seasonal climate predictions are possible as they rely on components that vary on longer timescales, known as "second type predictability" (Lorenz, 1993).

        <p>Another way to extend forecast lead time is to use seamless forecasting, which was first introduced by Palmer and Webster (1993), and aims to provide added predictability and lead time through integration of short-and medium-range forecasts with monthly-and seasonal-range forecasts. Seamless forecasting is based on the idea that "short-lived phenomena under certain conditions may persist and increase predictability at longer timescales" (Wetterhall and Di Guiseppe, 2018). Currently, in both meteorological and hydrological forecasting, systems producing medium-range and seasonal forecasts are typically distinct, and provide separate forecast products. In meteorological forecasting, ECMWF produces an extended-range forecast, which extends the medium-range forecasts out to monthly timescales (Vitart et al., 2008) using a seamless forecasting approach, and the UK Met Office Unified Model is designed to work across multiple timescales (Brown et al., 2012). So far, there is only limited application of this approach in operational hydrological and flood forecasting. Its application could be expanded to benefit operations by providing earlier indications of anomalous conditions. A recent study by Wetterhall and Di Giueseppe (2018) used an experimental configuration of EFAS, merging ECMWF's extended-range and seasonal forecasts before using them as input to a hydrological model, and showed that this seamless approach was able to provide more skilful forecasts --up to 7 weeks ahead --than forecasts using only the seasonal meteorological forecasts as input. The practice of merging short range NWP with longer range meteorological forecasts has long been an operational approach used in the US NWS, although until the advent of HEFS, the short-range forecast component was deterministic.Another way to extend forecast lead time is to use seamless forecasting, which was first introduced by Palmer and Webster (1993), and aims to provide added predictability and lead time through integration of short-and medium-range forecasts with monthly-and seasonal-range forecasts.

        <p>In future, we are likely to see more extended-range and seamless forecasts of hydrological variables, particularly as earth-system models continue to be developed and improved, allowing decision-makers to benefit from the combination of earlier indications of anomalous events, and shorter-range forecasts of specific flood events.In future, we are likely to see more extended-range and seamless forecasts of hydrological variables, particularly as earth-system models continue to be developed and improved, allowing decision-makers to benefit from the combination of earlier indications of anomalous events, and shorter-range forecasts of specific flood events.</p>
        <p>Current practice in ensemble flood forecasting is mostly based on generating ensemble forecasts from different meteorological inputs, different initial conditions, multiple hydrological models, or multiple parameter sets, or a combination of above (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009;Duan et al., 2019;Roundy et al., 2019). The most common approach to ensemble flood forecasting is to generate flood forecasts by perturbed initial conditions for either NWP models, the output of which are used as forcing inputs to drive a hydrological model(s), or for the hydrological models themselves (Moradkhani et al., 2019). For the former approach, raw ensemble precipitation forecasts must be post-processed via some type of statistical techniques to remove the systematic and spread biases inherent in those forecasts (Li et al., 2017).Current practice in ensemble flood forecasting is mostly based on generating ensemble forecasts from different meteorological inputs, different initial conditions, multiple hydrological models, or multiple parameter sets, or a combination of above (Cloke and Pappenberger, 2009;Duan et al., 2019;Roundy et al., 2019).

        <p>There are different types of post-processors, i.e., the statistical models relating raw forecasts to corresponding observations. There are numerous methods for characterising the raw forecast/observation dependence relationships. A popular method is to use various regression techniques, including multi-variate linear regression (not suited for precipitation forecasts, Glann and Lowry, 1992), nonlinear regression (Wilks and Hamill, 2007;Scheurer, 2014;Baran and Nemoda, 2016), logistic regression (Wilks, 2009), and quantile regression (Weerts et al., 2010). Another commonly used method is to construct joint probability models of raw forecasts and observations (Krzysztofowicz and Maranzano, 2006;Schaake et al., 2007;Wang et al., 2009). Other types of post-processors include analogs (van den Dool, 1994;Hamill and Whitaker, 2006;Todini, 2013), ensemble dressing (Pagano et al., 2013), multi-model averaging methods (Krishnamurti et al., 1999;Berrocal et al., 2008), among others. Reforecast data (i.e. the hindcasts of meteorological variables generated using a current meteorological model) covering a sufficiently long period of time (i.e. 20-30 years) are essential to constructing robust post-processors (Hamill et al., 2004). As ensemble precipitation forecast skill varies with lead times, separate post-processors for events of different lead-times need to be developed. For example, the statistical model relating the first day forecasts and observations would be different from the one relating the fifth day forecasts and observations as their statistical dependence structure would change. Once post-processors for different events covering the entire forecast horizon are constructed, it is then necessary to find ways to create ensemble space-time precipitation series needed to drive a hydrological model. The Schaake shuffle method has been a widely used method for creating space-time series of meteorological variables from post-processors of different events (Clark et al., 2004).There are different types of post-processors, i.e., the statistical models relating raw forecasts to corresponding observations.

        <p>For the latter approach, where the ensemble flood forecasts area generated by directly running a hydrological model(s) using perturbed initial conditions (Moradkhani et al., 2019), numerous methods can be used. The simplest way is to assume a certain distribution of the initial conditions and employ a Monte Carlo approach to sample the distribution to initiate the forecasts. More sophisticated way is to use ensemble data assimilation methods such as Ensemble Kalman Filter (Chen, et al., 2011) or some variational data assimilation methods (Lee et al., 2011) to merge model state variables and appropriate observations. It has been argued that the skill derived from model initial conditions can exceed that from the meteorological forecasts, especially at seasonal time scale (Maurer and Lettenmaier, 2003;Wood and Lettenmaier, 2008;Shukla and Lettenmaier, 2011;Shukla et al., 2013).For the latter approach, where the ensemble flood forecasts area generated by directly running a hydrological model(s) using perturbed initial conditions (Moradkhani et al., 2019), numerous methods can be used.

        <p>As all models are based on abstraction of real-world processes and are not expected to perform well under all conditions, ensemble forecasts based on multi-model methods have gained traction over the recent years (Ziehmann, 2000;Georgakakos et al., 2004;Ajami et al., 2006;Duan et al., 2006) and have also been used in many of the studies reviewed. Multi-model ensemble methods can be as simple as the poorman's ensemble, which treats all model predictions as equally good (Ebert, 2001), to more sophisticated methods such as super-ensemble approach (Krishnamurti et al., 1999) and the Bayesian Model Averaging method (Raftery, 2005), which weigh model predictions based on how well the predictions match the observations. Multi-model predictions have shown to have more skills than single model predictions in many studies (Ajami et al., 2006;Ajami, 2007;Duan et al., 2007;Madadgar and Moradkhani, 2014) and could be a promising approach to consider uncertainty in ensemble flood forecasting for flood management.As all models are based on abstraction of real-world processes and are not expected to perform well under all conditions, ensemble forecasts based on multi-model methods have gained traction over the recent years (Ziehmann, 2000;Georgakakos et al., 2004;Ajami et al., 2006;Duan et al., 2006) and have also been used in many of the studies reviewed.

        <p>Hydrological models generally contain a large number of parameters that vary with local conditions and are not directly observable. They must be inferred based on the fitness of model predictions with observations. Due to various uncertainties such as model initial conditions, model structure and the data used to calibrate the model, there is no unique set of parameters that are always the best for a particular application (Beven and Binley, 1992;Kuczera, 1983). Therefore, generating ensemble flood forecasts based on multi-parameter sets has been promoted by many researchers (Bates and Campbell, 2002;Ajami et al., 2007) and have also be employed in a number of the studies reviewed.Hydrological models generally contain a large number of parameters that vary with local conditions and are not directly observable.

        <p>Traditional verification measures of forecast skills such as root-mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), or correlation coefficient are no longer adequate to verify probabilistic forecasts when used in isolation, even though they have been used to verify the ensemble means in many of the studies reviewed. Other measures suited for probabilistic forecasts should be used. Good ensemble forecasts embody three traits: (1) the probability distribution is sharp, (2) forecasts do equally well for events of different magnitudes, and (3) forecast probability is consistent with observational frequency. There are a number of measures that have been developed for verification of ensemble forecast performance (Anctil and Ramos, 2019), including Brier scores (BS), continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), ranked histograms (RH), reliability diagrams (RD), and relative operating characteristics (ROC). A summary of the verification measures can be found in Brown et al. (2010). For comparison purpose, some of those verification metrics have been scaled to certain bench marks to yield skill scores. The benchmarks used are usually based on climatology or skill score of the raw forecasts.Traditional verification measures of forecast skills such as root-mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), or correlation coefficient are no longer adequate to verify probabilistic forecasts when used in isolation, even though they have been used to verify the ensemble means in many of the studies reviewed.

        <p>In addition, in the majority of the studies reviewed, between 10 and 100 ensemble members were used. This is consistent with most of the NWP products, the outputs of which are ultimate inputs for flood models. In a few studies, less than 10 ensemble members were used. Although depending on the specific cases, such a small number of ensemble members would be difficult to represent any type of uncertainty that needs to be quantified for a flood system. In 10 studies in the second review period, the number of ensemble members used was not mentioned, and as such, it is difficult for readers to understand the level of uncertainty considered and potentially undermines the credibility of the findings presented. Even with over 100 members (that are used in 4 studies), it would be difficult to represent extreme events with an occurrence probability of 1% or less. This issue could be exacerbated when the extreme flood events are caused by multiple (sometimes dependent) processes, such as such as coastal floods caused by extreme rainfall and storm surge, due to the increased risk (and rareness) of these flood events (Wu et. al, 2018). However, increasing ensemble members will increase computational effort significantly. Therefore, strategies for adequately representing uncertainty in compound floods using ensembles forecasts within a feasible computational budget remain a future research challenge.In addition, in the majority of the studies reviewed, between 10 and 100 ensemble members were used.

This issue could be exacerbated when the extreme flood events are caused by multiple (sometimes dependent) processes, such as such as coastal floods caused by extreme rainfall and storm surge, due to the increased risk (and rareness) of these flood events (Wu et. al, 2018). However, increasing ensemble members will increase computational effort significantly. Therefore, strategies for adequately representing uncertainty in compound floods using ensembles forecasts within a feasible computational budget remain a future research challenge.</p>
        <p>The past 15 years have marked significant accomplishments in the development and operational adoption of strategies for ensemble flood forecasting. When HEPEX (A global community in hydrological ensemble prediction) was initiated in 2004, ensemble flood forecasting was virtually unheard of in official practice, yet initial research was underway toward understanding the ramifications of using ensemble datasets and methods in hydrologic prediction (Franz et al, 2005;Schaake et al, 2006). Since then, a coherent view of the critical scientific challenges in ensemble flood forecasting has emerged, and hundreds of studies (many of which are reviewed in this article), have been published to shed light on theoretical and practical aspects of challenges such as hydrologic ensemble data assimilation, ensemble forecast post-processing, meteorological ensemble forecast downscaling, and ensemble forecast verification. In addition, a HEPEX-led Handbook of Hydrometeorological Ensemble Forecasting (Duan et al., 2019) was written to discuss not only the relevant challenges and existing strategies, but also the details of numerous real-world case studies. Complementary advances have also been made in hydrologic model development and parameter estimation, which represent further critical challenges (Clark et al, 2017). This progress has enabled a number of countries to implement operational ensemble flood forecasting systems (Addor et al., 2011;Pappenberger et al., 2016, and references therein;Emerton et al, 2016, and references therein), even if these still generally run in parallel to their legacy deterministic flood forecasting systems. There are by now many clear operational examples of ensemble forecasts that are used to support decision-making, with many examples to choose from, such as the New York City Department of Environmental Protection's Operations Support Tool, a state-of-the-art decision support system for the city's water supply system (NASEM, 2018), in the Sonoma County Water Authority Lake Mendocino system operations (Delaney et al, 2019), for navigation scheduling operations in Germany (Hemri and Klein, 2017;Meißner and Klein, 2015;Meißner et al, 2017), and in many private sector operations, particularly those related to hydropower.The past 15 years have marked significant accomplishments in the development and operational adoption of strategies for ensemble flood forecasting.

        <p>The development and adoption of ensemble flood forecasts in risk mitigation for humanitarian objectives have also expanded, with recent examples including the application of global-domain ensemble flood forecasts from systems such as GLOFAS. Though partnerships with the International Red Cross, for instance, the operational GLOFAS ensemble forecasts support strategic decisions in the staging of emergency resources ahead of and during flooding events in Africa and South America (ECMWF, 2020;GloFAS , 2020;RCCC, 2019).The development and adoption of ensemble flood forecasts in risk mitigation for humanitarian objectives have also expanded, with recent examples including the application of global-domain ensemble flood forecasts from systems such as GLOFAS.

        <p>The new ensemble forecasting systems are diverse but not ubiquitous, and this current landscape indicates that despite substantial theoretical progress, operational ensemble flood forecasting has yet to become the standard. Note that the history of operational ensemble NWP, which has moved along at least a decade or more relative to ensemble numerical hydrological prediction (NHP), suggests that both deterministic and ensemble NHP are likely to co-exist for the foreseeable future, with some centres or stakeholders favouring products generated via more complex systems that are computationally infeasible in ensemble contexts. To the extent that the two enterprises compete for resources, and may involve different development and operations groups, this parallel path may be counterproductive even while it may best serve a broad range of stakeholders.The new ensemble forecasting systems are diverse but not ubiquitous, and this current landscape indicates that despite substantial theoretical progress, operational ensemble flood forecasting has yet to become the standard.

        <p>The challenges currently facing the expansion of ensemble flood forecasting into operations, and further into the decision workflows of water and emergency management and related sectoral uses can be broadly grouped into several major categories: (1) scientific hurdles, (2) the operational readiness of the forecasting community, (3) communication and outreach to users, and (4) the operational capacity of the decision-making sector. Several additional, critical difficulties affect both traditional deterministic forecasting as well as ensemble forecasting, including the sufficiency of observational networks, the need for effective approaches to parameter estimation, and the lack of reliable hydrologic data assimilation (DA) methods, all of which are exacerbated in regional or larger scale applications.The challenges currently facing the expansion of ensemble flood forecasting into operations, and further into the decision workflows of water and emergency management and related sectoral uses can be broadly grouped into several major categories: (1) scientific hurdles, (2) the operational readiness of the forecasting community, (3) communication and outreach to users, and (4) the operational capacity of the decision-making sector.

        <p>In general, such unmet scientific challenges are manifest in poor forecast quality, which impedes their acceptance and stakeholder perceptions of usability. Perhaps the most critical scientific need for ensemble forecasting is a reliable DA implementation, which particularly affects ensemble systems because they tend to be automated (versus interactive, as with many deterministic systems). Many systems, and especially regional to global ones, lack DA at present and consequently their outputs can be unusable. While operational flood forecasting is a long-standing practice, flood forecast production centres often lack a detailed understanding of what is involved in producing a skilful, automated, reliable ensemble forecast, including the aforementioned DA methods, as well as NWP ensemble pre-processing, streamflow ensemble post-processing, verification practices, the value of hindcasting, and even intuitive product formation. Operational centres in hydrology often lack a strong connection to the research community, and may be unaware of beneficial advances. The existing operational data and computing systems may be unready to expand to accommodate an ensemble workflow, especially if it must compete for resources and attention with a well-accepted deterministic workflow. Forecast staff also require training and support, and such resources take time to prepare, to resource, and to standardize throughout an organization. For instance, the deployment of HEFS in the US took years, which included not only data and forecast systems but also such human resources capacity building. Recently, innovative methods have also been developed to highlight the complex decision-making involved in flood management. One example is the IMPREX serious game, called "Pathways to running a flood forecasting centre: an adventure game", developed by Arnal et al. (2017;www.imprex.arctik.tech) as part of the Horizon 2020 IMPREX project. The project aims to draw attention to the role forecasts can play in managing extreme weather, with the example of protecting a city from floods using ensemble forecasts and problem-solving skills. This is just one of a range of serious games that have been developed around ensemble hydrological forecasting (Arnal et al., 2017;HEPEX, 2020).In general, such unmet scientific challenges are manifest in poor forecast quality, which impedes their acceptance and stakeholder perceptions of usability.

        <p>At the last HEPEX international Workshop (Melbourne, Australia, February 2016), a poll of participants revealed that the highest ranked priorities for HEPEX involved communication related topics. Participants from forecast user groups questioned the costs versus benefits of shifting to using an ensemble forecast, as well as the practical mechanics of how such forecasts might be used for decision-making. This value proposition is being supported by researchers (Zappa et al. 2013) and demonstrated episodically, by groups that have become early adopters (such as Germany's BfG forecasting agency, which assessed the marginal economic benefits of ensemble forecasts for navigation), but not communicated uniformly throughout the potential stakeholder community. Stakeholders with strong incentives to use forecast information (such as hydropower companies, which can translate improved or expanded information into economic gains) are relatively advanced in understanding such questions, but such stakeholders may not openly share their practices with the community.At the last HEPEX international Workshop (Melbourne, Australia, February 2016), a poll of participants revealed that the highest ranked priorities for HEPEX involved communication related topics.

        <p>A related challenge is that the operational capacity to ingest and incorporate ensemble forecasts into decision support systems (DSS) for water management may be lacking. DSS such as water management models may be designed to simulate a single inflow scenario, and require manual input from reservoir managers to determine release schedules, meaning that a significant upgrade and change to a more automated paradigm would be needed to shift to using ensemble forecasts. Optimal rules for making risk-based decisions may also be unknown, and require time and experience for development. Any aspects of operations that require expert input or judgement, or interaction with multiple parties, can be a hurdle to reliance on ensemble-based information. While sophisticated optimal control system approaches have long existed (e.g. the use of stochastic dynamic programming in reservoir operations) in some parts of the water management sector (and particularly in private or hydropower-related entities), these are by far not the standard, particularly for publicly owned systems.A related challenge is that the operational capacity to ingest and incorporate ensemble forecasts into decision support systems (DSS) for water management may be lacking.

        <p>Although ensemble flood forecasting has been a research focus for 2-3 decades, the majority of the research activities focus on hydro-meteorological forecasting. This is evident from the review outcome that rainfall and flow are predicted (via climate and hydrological modelling) in over 80% of the cases investigated and only a few studies considered flood inundation levels or extent, which are directly related to flood impact. This is also reflected in the review outcome that most of the flood events considered occurred on a catchment or basin scale, with less than 20% of studies considering floods on local scales, which mostly relate to urban or flash floods. The strong focus of the studies on catchment hydrological processes is directly related to data availability. Conventional observational data are commonly collected for rural catchments and very few urban catchments are gauged. However, this situation may change as new data sources, such as remote sensing and reanalysis data, become more accessible and the quality of these data further improve. In addition, computing resources requirement is another limiting factor for the consideration of flood inundation variables. Most commonly used flood inundation models are 2D hydrodynamic models, which are computationally expensive, making it difficult to consider uncertainty using ensemble forecasting techniques. Furthermore, the disconnect between the hydro-metrological and hydraulic modelling research communities further exacerbates the situation.Although ensemble flood forecasting has been a research focus for 2-3 decades, the majority of the research activities focus on hydro-meteorological forecasting.

        <p>In the papers reviewed, only more recent studies reported on flash floods, which have a very short lead time (i.e. less than 6 hours). This is not only due to limitations on data availability, but also the high requirement on the precision of the prediction of both rainfall intensity and location. Improving the forecast accuracy of flood location requires high resolution NWP models and hydrological models (if a pluvial process is involved), both of which are outstanding challenges. In addition, very few papers considered compound floods, which are caused by multiple (often dependent) driving mechanisms, such as coastal floods caused by extreme rainfall and sea levels. Compound extreme flooding is an emerging topic for flood management due to the growing awareness (and publicity) of such events from increased intensity of extreme weather events giving arise to them, such as Tropical Cyclone Yasi in Australia in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in the US in 2012, both caused extensive flooding and devastating consequences in coastal areas. The reason behind the lack of consideration of uncertainty using ensemble techniques in compound flood forecasting is also multi-fold. First, it is more difficult to generate/collect data of multiple dependent flood drivers during the same time period. There are only limited locations where such observational data may exist. This situation cannot be improved easily with new emerging data sources, such as satellite observations, due to the extreme rareness of compound floods. Different compound flood drivers, such as rainfall and sea levels, are commonly studied by different research communities, which creates another barrier for data exchange. In addition, integrated climate-ocean-land modelling (especially on a local scale) is still a challenging task.In the papers reviewed, only more recent studies reported on flash floods, which have a very short lead time (i.e. less than 6 hours).

        <p>Finally, most of the papers reviewed focus on answering research questions, either related to modelling techniques (e.g. ensemble model studies) or how to use ensemble modelling techniques to simulate past flood events or assess flood risk in specific locations (e.g. ensemble utilisation studies). The application of ensemble flood forecasting to solve a real-world problem was only considered in less than 30% of the studies, most of which are from the more recent review period. The increasing trend in application related studies is a promising sign that more flood practitioners are taking up ensemble forecast as a useful technique. However, the current scope of applications is quite limited, with a focus on flood warning, risk analysis and reservoir operation. The papers reviewed did not include studies on the use of ensemble forecasting in other emerging application areas, such as evacuation planning in emergency management and risk mitigation for humanitarian actions.Finally, most of the papers reviewed focus on answering research questions, either related to modelling techniques (e.g. ensemble model studies) or how to use ensemble modelling techniques to simulate past flood events or assess flood risk in specific locations (e.g. ensemble utilisation studies).

        <p>Challenges lie ahead to make ensemble flood forecasting a common tool used for flood management or water management in general. First, forecast flood variables need to be extended to include flood inundation depth and extent which are directly related to flood impact and commonly used in the water industry for flood risk/hazard evaluation, as discussed above. Second, forecast lead time needs to be extended to cater for various types of water management tasks. For example, environmental flood allocation in the Murray Darlings Basin in Australia often requires information up to 3 months ahead, necessitating the extension of flood forecasts lead time to sub-seasonal and seasonal scales (i.e. very long range). Long-range forecasts will also improve flood preparedness and mitigation. In addition, effective communication of ensemble forecasting to both scientific and non-scientific communities who are not familiar with the concept is key to encourage the uptake of ensemble flood forecasting in water management, through improved exchange of data, techniques and ideas.Challenges lie ahead to make ensemble flood forecasting a common tool used for flood management or water management in general.

        <p>We conclude that in order to encourage the uptake of ensemble flood forecasting in flood management or water management in general, there is a need to not only improve technical aspects of flood forecasting, but also to bridge the gap between different scientific research communities, as well as between the scientific community and flood forecasters and managers. We hope this paper has contributed towards achieving this goal.We conclude that in order to encourage the uptake of ensemble flood forecasting in flood management or water management in general, there is a need to not only improve technical aspects of flood forecasting, but also to bridge the gap between different scientific research communities, as well as between the scientific community and flood forecasters and managers.

        <p>Although there are many technical aspects ensemble modelling focused studies could investigate, the reviewed papers mainly focused on three aspects of ensemble modelling, including data assimilation, ensemble generation and post-processing. Ensemble utilisation focused studies can be categorised into three categories, including the development of methods for ensemble flood forecasting, the comparison or evaluation of different ensemble forecasting products, and feasibility studies examining if certain ensemble products (e.g. NWP) can be used for flood forecasts in specific areas. The application focused studies mainly considered application of ensemble flood forecasts in flood warning, reservoir operation (for flood control or navigation) and flood risk analysis.Although there are many technical aspects ensemble modelling focused studies could investigate, the reviewed papers mainly focused on three aspects of ensemble modelling, including data assimilation, ensemble generation and post-processing.

The types of flood considered include floods from rural or urban catchments, flash floods that have a typical onset time of less than six hours (e.g. within a rainfall event) (Hapuarachchi et al., 2011) and compound floods that are caused by multiple flood driving processes (Zscheischler et al., 2018). The spatial scale of the floods can be divided into local floods, which impact a relatively small local area (e.g. &lt; 100 km 2 ), basin or catchment scale (e.g. between 100 km 2 and 2,000 km 2 ) and regional scale (e.g. &gt; 2,000 km 2 ) that affect a relatively large area that could be across multiple countries or catchments. The temporal resolution investigated includes the frequency of the flood data predicted (e.g. sub-daily or daily). In addition, the lead time of flood forecasted is also examined, which is divided into very short range (i.e. less than 24 hours), short range (i.e. one to two days), medium range (i.e. three to 15 days), long range (i.e. 15 to 30 days) and very long range (i.e. longer than 30 days). Since it is possible for more than one system to be investigated in one paper, the review was conducted based on the number of times each case study falls into each defined category.The case studies investigated in the papers were analysed based on the geographic locations of the case study systems, the type(s) of flood considered, the spatial scale and temporal resolution of the case studies, including forecast lead time considered.

        <p>The flood modelling aspect of the papers was investigated to understand the types of flood models used, flood variables predicted and flood driving processes considered. The types of models used in the papers reviewed include numerical weather prediction models (predicting weather variables, such as rainfall), hydrological models (simulating rainfall-runoff processes), hydraulic models (1D, 2D, 3D or conceptual models simulating flood levels or inundation) and data driven models, ranging from simple regression models to machine-learning techniques (simulating various flood variables). Flood variables predicted are directly related to flood models used and include rainfall intensity (as surrogate of intensity of floods), stream flow, flood inundation levels and area. Flood driving processes considered include precipitation (i.e. through a pluvial process), riverine floods (i.e. through a fluvial process), ocean processes such as high astronomical tide or storm surge, other meteorological conditions such as temperature, pressure, wind and humidity, as well as catastrophic events, such as dam failure or glacial lake outburst floods. It should be noted that more than one type of flood model, flood variable or driving processes may be considered in a study and therefore the total number in each category in the summary could exceed the total number of papers reviewed, as mentioned above.The flood modelling aspect of the papers was investigated to understand the types of flood models used, flood variables predicted and flood driving processes considered.

        <p>The ensemble modelling aspect of the papers was investigated based on how the ensembles were generated, how the ensemble forecasts were evaluated, and the number of ensemble members used. The methods used to generate ensembles are divided into four categories, including Multi-model-based ensemble, initial/boundary condition perturbation, parameterisation of models, and statistical approach to account for errors (e.g. Bayesian approach or residual error) in an integrated manner. Ensemble forecasting evaluation methods includes 1) methods considering the whole distribution of ensemble forecast, such as Brier Score (BS), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), CRPS, Reliability diagram, Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, Fractions Skill Score (FSS),and Rank histogram, among others; 2) traditional threshold values based methods, such as contingency table showing hits and misses, Critical Success Index (CSI), Gilbert Skill Score (GSS) and probability of threshold exceedance/detection, among others; 3) traditional error statistics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Taylor diagram; and 4) ad hoc methods, which are mainly based on visual inspection (e.g. the spaghetti plot, postage stamp maps or quantile maps) or evaluation of ensemble means only. In addition, the number of ensemble members used in each of the studies was also investigated to understand the extent of uncertainties considered and the applicability of ensemble forecasts in representing different flood producing conditions, especially extreme or component flood events.The ensemble modelling aspect of the papers was investigated based on how the ensembles were generated, how the ensemble forecasts were evaluated, and the number of ensemble members used.
