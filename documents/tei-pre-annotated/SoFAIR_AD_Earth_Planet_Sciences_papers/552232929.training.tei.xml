        <p>Atmospheric aerosols significantly affect visibility, air quality and climate 1 . Exposure to atmospheric aerosols has been associated with increased cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity 2 . Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) may originate from natural and anthropogenic sources and account for 20-50% of aerosol loading globally 3,4 . The composition of OAs may be complex, comprising of thousands of compounds from simple hydrocarbons to highly oxidized compounds. Directly emitted hydrocarbon components are referred to as primary organic aerosols (POAs) and OA formed via the atmospheric oxidation of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are referred to as secondary organic aerosol (SOA).Atmospheric aerosols significantly affect visibility, air quality and climate 1 .

        <p>The formation of SOAs has recently received much attention as they have been shown to be a major component of atmospheric OAs 5 . For example, 50% of fine particle mass is composed of OAs in the urban locations within the Northern Hemisphere. The SOA fraction ranged from 65 to 95% between urban and remote regions 6 . The precursors of SOAs include VOCs emitted from both biogenic (e.g., terrestrial vegetation, grassland, peatlands and forest) and anthropogenic sources (e.g., biomass burning, coal combustion, transportation, solvent utilization and industry). Under atmospheric conditions, VOCs may undergo atmospheric oxidation with ozone (O 3 ), nitrate (NO 3 ) and hydroxyl radicals (OH) to form less volatile products which may undergo further reactions and/or partition into the condensed phase, leading to complex chemical composition profiles within the aerosol.The formation of SOAs has recently received much attention as they have been shown to be a major component of atmospheric OAs 5 .

        <p>Atmospheric models indicate that annual SOA fluxes are largely dominated by biogenic SOA (BSOA, 88 TgC/yr), followed by biomass burning SOA (BBSOA, 17 TgC/yr), and anthropogenic SOA (ASOA, 10 TgC/yr) 7 . This highlights the dominance of biogenic VOCs over other SOA precursors, where isoprene alone contributes ~50% to the global VOCs flux 8 . ASOA precursors are mostly composed of alkanes (40%), followed by aromatics (20%) and alkenes (10%) with the rest being oxygenated and unidentified compounds 9 . In urban environments, light aromatic hydrocarbons contribute up to 30% of VOCs 10 and 3-25 TgC/yr to global SOA production, up to 2-3 fold higher than previous model estimates 11 . Ambient measurements have also shown the importance of ASOA in urban environments as they were found to be contributing significantly to the OA mass and can be substantially higher in concentration than BSOA 12,13 .Atmospheric models indicate that annual SOA fluxes are largely dominated by biogenic SOA (BSOA, 88 TgC/yr), followed by biomass burning SOA (BBSOA, 17 TgC/yr), and anthropogenic SOA (ASOA, 10 TgC/yr) 7 .

        <p>Atmospheric models use parameterizations of SOA yield curves obtained from laboratory experiments to predict SOA mass concentrations. However, SOA yield data are not available for all ASOA precursors due to a limited number of laboratory studies, with some ASOA precursors and processes (e.g., cloud processing or other aerosol-phase reactions) that contribute to SOA not being considered 14 . OAs need to be well characterised within atmospheric models to develop effective air quality management plans, that mitigate adverse health and climate impacts of atmospheric aerosol loading and exposure. There are several potential causes for the widespread negative bias in model predictions of OAs. This review focuses on SOA formation from ASOA precursors, which historically has not been investigated extensively.Atmospheric models use parameterizations of SOA yield curves obtained from laboratory experiments to predict SOA mass concentrations.

        <p>The objectives of this work are to summarize the outcomes of existing knowledge on ASOA precursors and their oxidation products from atmospheric simulation chamber studies. We also compare SOA yields from different precursors and the factors controlling the SOA mass yield. Since this is a very large subject, the coverage does not extend to natural precursors such as isoprene and terpenes, or to reaction processes in the aqueous phase. The latter have been reviewed by Blando and Turpin 15 , Carlton et al. 16 , Ervens et al. 17 and Mahilang et al. 18 Finally, gaps in knowledge between SOA contribution from lab, field and modelling studies are discussed.The objectives of this work are to summarize the outcomes of existing knowledge on ASOA precursors and their oxidation products from atmospheric simulation chamber studies.

Predominantly, chambers are several cubic metres in volume and made from Teflon film and are often equipped with a standard set of instruments, including an integrated temperature and humidity probe and a differential pressure indicator [19][20][21][22] . In addition, chambers are often equipped with sets of narrow-band blacklights and/or UV broadband lamps for irradiation 20,21 . The lamps usually have a standard 300 -400 nm spectrum, centred at 350 nm.

        <p>In most high-NO x experiments, OH radicals are produced by the photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) using UV lamps [24][25][26][27] .

        <p>For low-NO x experiments, H 2 O 2 is used as the OH precursor 25,28 . An atmospherically relevant OH concentration (ca.10 6 molecule cm -3 ) is produced by photolysing the H 2 O 2 in the chamber [29][30][31] .

        <p>Oxidation flow reactor (OFR) designs. Oxidation Flow Reactors (OFRs) produce highly oxidizing conditions to accelerate processes which would usually take a number of days in the atmosphere to a few minutes in the laboratory/field. In addition to being used to generate SOA particles, the OFRs are also used to simulate atmospheric processing of soot and other model POAs. OFR185 and OFR254 (i.e., 185 and 254 nm photolysis lamps) are the most basic operation modes and have been used most widely to investigate the accelerated atmospheric chemistry 34 . In OFR254 mode, filtered low-pressure mercury lamps provide 254 nm light to photolyze externally generated O 3 in the reactor to form OH (Reactions: 4-5). However, in OFR185 mode the low-pressure mercury lamps are not filtered and emit 185 nm light that can photolyze H 2 O producing OH, and O 2 into O( 3 P), meaning externally generated O 3 is not required. In addition, O( 3 P) recombines with O 2 to form O 3 , which can also produce OH with the help of 254 nm UV lamps, as in OFR254. Hence, OH radical (8 × 10 8 -2 × 10 10 molecule cm -3 ) production processes for both, OFR254 and OFR185, is given by Reactions: 4-5 and 6-9, respectively [34][35][36][37] . OFRs are operated under continuous flow conditions, where environmental chambers are typically run in batches. The OH/HO 2 and OH/O 3 ratios in the OFRs are similar to those found in the troposphere, while daytime concentrations of OH, HO 2 and O 3 are 100 to 10,000 times larger.

        <p>This section reviews the reaction products observed from the oxidation of AVOCs. Details on the reaction products from alkane and aromatic AVOC oxidation are given in Tables 1 and2. Most studies have involved single precursor VOC, but many have varied the concentrations of NO x , which can fundamentally influence reaction pathways, and have included seed inorganic or organic aerosol, both of which influence SOA yields. The mechanisms and effects of such additional factors are explored in later sections. Overall, this section begins with providing a short description of alkanes and aromatics, and their relevance in the atmosphere, followed by a generalised reaction scheme based on the oxidation from OH, chlorine (Cl) and nitrate (NO 3 ) radical. Later, the section discusses major reaction products obtained from the oxidation of individual precursors under different experimental conditions based on the results from published studies. In addition, a brief introduction to organosulfates formation from the oxidation of alkanes and aromatics is also included.This section reviews the reaction products observed from the oxidation of AVOCs.

        <p>Alkanes are a main class of AVOCs (40-50% of total VOCs) in urban areas 32,42 . They are predominantly emitted from combustion sources, such as traffic emissions, petroleum and fossil fuel combustion 31 . Ensberg et al. 43 reported that a major fraction of diesel and gasoline fuels contains cyclic, branched and linear alkanes, while long-chain alkanes constitute a substantial fraction of the unresolved complex mixture from fossil fuels 44 . Their ambient lifetimes are predominantly governed by reaction with OH and range from 0.5 days for n-hexadecane (C 16 ) to 1.4 days for n-octane (C 8 ) 45,46 . This is sufficiently long for their transport from urban to rural areas, indicating their importance within the atmosphere. Therefore, following the development sequence, the generalised alkane oxidation reaction scheme (SOA formation pathways) and the oxidation products are discussed below.Alkanes are a main class of AVOCs (40-50% of total VOCs) in urban areas 32,42 .

        <p>Formation pathways. In the atmosphere, OH is the dominant daytime sink of alkanes forming alkyl peroxy radicals (RO 2 ). RO 2 subsequently reacts with NO to form alkyl nitrate or alkoxy radicals (RO), which could react with O 2 , decompose or isomerize 23,33 . The reaction mechanism of OH with linear, branched, or cyclic alkanes in the presence of NO x is shown in Fig. 1. For linear and branched alkanes, decomposition leads to fragmentation and forms carbonyls and RO 2 after addition of O 2 . For cyclic alkanes, the formation of a single ring-opened carbonyl RO 2 is observed. All RO 2 formed at different stages (alkyl peroxy, carbonyl alkyl peroxy, and 1,4-hydroxy alkyl peroxy radicals) can react further with NO/ O 2 or isomerise or react again with OH radicals to form multigeneration products.Formation pathways.

        <p>Major reaction products. A wide range of SOA products have been identified, which not only strongly depend on molecular size and structure of each precursor (linear/ branched/cyclic and functional groups) and degree of oxidation, but also on other chamber conditions during the ageing process (i.e., NO x concentration and relative humidity (RH)) 47,48 . Alcohols, carboxylic acids, ketones and carbonyls are commonly the first oxidation products of branched and linear alkanes 22,48,49 . Carbonyls are predominantly formed from reactions of OH and C 5 -C 8 n-alkanes with NO 49 . Reisen et al. 49 found that formation of 1,4-hydroxycarbonyls accounts for 54, 57, 51, and 53% of the reaction products from C 5 -C 8 n-alkanes, respectively. The formation of relatively more complex structures occurs as second phase oxidation products come from the aerosol chemistry of carbonyl groups. For example, 1,4-substituted hydroxycarbonyl compounds may undergo cyclization and result in the formation of cyclic hemiacetals that can dehydrate to form highly reactive substituted dihydrofurans or aldehydes that undergo imine formation with amines.Major reaction products.

        <p>OH-initiated reactions of n-dodecane (C 12 )/2-methylundecane/ hexylcyclohexane and cyclododecane with low-NO x result in the formation of the RO 2 radical that rapidly produces a hydroperoxide upon reaction with HO 2 as a first-generation product, and subsequently several high generation products, such as hydroxycarbonyls, hydroperoxides, hydroperoxycarbonyls, hydroxy hydroperoxides, peracids, peroxyhemiacetals (PHA), and dihydroperoxide 31,[50][51][52] . It has also been reported that acidic species are expected to form from the photolysis of hydroperoxy groups which include carboxylic acids, peracids, hydroxy carboxylic acids, and hydroxy peracids. It was also reported that the dominant species in n-dodecane SOA formed under low-NO conditions are functionalized hemiacetals and peroxyhemiacetals, which account for 98% of the estimated SOA mass 31 . They are formed from aerosol chemistry traditionally considered to be acid-catalysed. In addition, low-NO x SOA formed from cyclododecane is mainly composed of ethers and peroxyhemiacetals and contains minor contributions of hydroxycarbonyls, hydroperoxides, and alcohols. Similarly, hexylcyclohexane SOA is composed of hydroperoxides, peroxyhemiacetals, hemiacetals, and hydroxycarbonyls under low-NO x conditions.OH-initiated reactions of n-dodecane (C 12 )/2-methylundecane/ hexylcyclohexane and cyclododecane with low-NO x result in the formation of the RO 2 radical that rapidly produces a hydroperoxide upon reaction with HO 2 as a first-generation product, and subsequently several high generation products, such as hydroxycarbonyls, hydroperoxides, hydroperoxycarbonyls, hydroxy hydroperoxides, peracids, peroxyhemiacetals (PHA), and dihydroperoxide 31,[50][51][52] .

        <p>Under high NO x , more SOA products are identified, such as nitrate and ester groups 44 . The formation of hydroxy-nitrates, dinitrates, and alkyl nitrates are observed by oxidation of alkanes (C 6 -C 15 ) with OH under high concentration of NO x 21,22,33 . The oxidation products formed from the reactions of OH with linear, branched, and cyclic alkanes are similar. The first-generation SOA products rapidly isomerize in the aerosol phase to form cyclic hemiacetals, which go on to dehydrate to form volatile dihydrofurans. Any volatile products react with OH forming multigeneration products, which are acyclic or monocyclic for all alkanes, and can also be bicyclic from cyclic alkanes. In addition, 1,4-hydroxycarbonyls are an important first generation product in SOA formation from alkanes, as reported by Reisen et al. 49 .Under high NO x , more SOA products are identified, such as nitrate and ester groups 44 .

        <p>Similarly, the formation of alkoxyhydroperoxy aldehyde from reactions of cyclic alkenes and O 3 was reported 53 . These compounds can isomerize via intramolecular reaction between the hydroperoxyl and carbonyl groups to form a cyclic peroxyhemiacetal. Other products such as ketones and lactones are identified from the reaction of cholestane, squalane and octacosane, with OH 48,54 . The octacosanone and octacosanol positional isomers, which are the most prominent first-generation products, were observed during octacosane oxidation. In addition, cholestanones, cholestanals, and cholestanols, are the dominant first-generation functionalization products observed from cholestane oxidation accounting for &lt;70% of the mass of total speciated compounds. Second-generation oxidation products (i.e., fragmentation) and higher-generation products (i.e., functionalization) are much less abundant.

Similarly, hexylcyclohexane SOA produced under similar conditions contains an abundance of oligomeric compounds: hydroxycarbonyl dimers, hemiacetals, and esters 31 . For dodecane oxidation, a distinct feature is the formation of an ester or ether group formed from the dihydrofuran oxidation by either OH or O 3 55 . The formation of tetrahydrofuran and carbonyl ester solely occur via the OH oxidation channel. However, ozonolysis produces an energy-rich primary ozonide, which rapidly decomposes into Criegee intermediates. Similarly, Li et al. 56 also observed the formation of hydroxycarbonyls, hemiacetals, and acid anhydrides, under high-NO x conditions from the oxidation of long-chain n-alkanes 57 .In the photooxidation of dodecane under high-NO x , RO 2 + NO gas-phase chemistry forms RO species, which decompose to aldehydes or isomerize to alcohols 31 .

        <p>Overall, the hydroxycarbonyl, the most dominant firstgeneration product from the alkane oxidation (via isomerization of RO), can undergo heterogeneous cyclisation and dehydration to form a substituted dihydrofuran 21,22,33,[49][50][51][52]55 , which is likely to be highly reactive with OH, O 3 and NO 3 due to the presence of a double bond.

        <p>Formation pathways. Atmospheric oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons is dominated by reaction with OH, resulting in the formation of a variety of oxidation products via ring-retaining and -opening chemical pathways 58 . Briefly, the OH initiated oxidation of aromatics (≥90%) proceeds via OH-addition to the ring yielding an aromatic-OH-adduct (Ar-OH-adduct), also known as the hydroxycylclohexadienyl radical (and its methylated derivates) [61][62][63] . An example of the available reaction pathways has been given for the reaction of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB) with the OH radical (Fig. 2). Dealkylation and the H-atom abstraction from substituent alkyl groups are minor reaction pathways 62,64,65 . The fate of the Ar-OH-adduct is dominated by reactions with O 2 via reversible/ irreversible pathways. The products of the Ar-OHadduct + O 2 reactions are phenols (C), epoxides (E), and a bicyclic peroxy radical (G). Formation of oxepins (H) has been observed but not in the case of OH + benzene 66 . The bicyclic peroxy radical (biRO 2 ) is a major product from aromatic oxidation with formation yields of &gt;50% for alkylbenzenes 67 . The reaction of biRO 2 is further assumed to yield bicyclic hydroperoxides (K), bicyclic diols (L), and bicyclic ketones (M). The ring opening could potentially lead to the formation of α-dicarbonyls (e.g., glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and dimethyl-glyoxal), unsaturated γ-dicarbonyls (e.g., butenedial, 4oxo-2-pentenal) and furanones or a combination of these products.Formation pathways.

        <p>Major reaction products. Outdoor smog chamber photooxidations of toluene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, m-ethyltoluene, p-ethyltoluene, and 1,2,4-TMB have been conducted in the presence of sunlight and hydrocarbon-NO x mixtures 68 . This study reported that unsaturated anhydrides (furandiones) are the predominant components of aerosol from all the aromatics, while a significant amount of saturated anhydrides was also observed, which could have resulted from the hydrogenation of the furandiones within the aerosol phase. In particular, the more dominant species identified in toluene SOA include furandiones, phenols and benzoic acid where ~40% are linked to ring-retaining products and ~60% are most probably arising from ringfragmentation pathways. In the case of m-xylene and ethylbenzene, ring-fragmentation products comprise a significant portion of the SOA. The dominant organic products include furandiones and m-toluic acid for m-xylene with carbonyls, furandiones and phenols for ethylbenzene. In the case of p-xylene, SOA was composed of similar products as from m-xylene including dicarbonyls and substituted phenols. The ring-retaining and ring-fragmentation pathways were equally as important in 1,2,4-TMB SOA and mainly included benzoic acids, furandiones and carbonyls. Similar products were also observed in m-and pethyltoluene SOA 68 . In addition, ring cleavage products from the gas-phase reactions of the OH radical with p-xylene and 1,2,3-and 1,2,4-TMB under varying concentrations of NO 2 included 3hexene-2,5-dione (32%, 31% percentage yields for p-xylene and 1,2,4-TMB oxidation), 2,3-butanedione (52%) from 1,2,3-TMB oxidation 69 . The formation of other ring cleavage products, such as unsaturated dicarbonyls and epoxydicarbonyls, were also observed. Similarly, Jang and Kamens 70 also studied SOA from the photooxidation of toluene. The gas-phase reaction led to substituted aromatics, and non-aromatic ring-retaining andopening products. The major SOA products included: nitrophenols, quinones, aromatic carbonyls, oxoacids, and unsaturated dicarbonyls. Results also showed that aldehyde products (glyoxal, methylglyoxal, hydroxyacetaldehyde, and some ring-opening products) could further react through heterogeneous processes and contribute to SOA formation. The formation of substituted aromatics and ring cleavage products from the photooxidation of toluene under different NO x conditions were also reported 71 . The major chemical constituents of the aerosol are hemiacetal, peroxy hemiacetal oligomers and low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids.

        <p>Glyoxal is a major primary product from reactions of benzene, toluene, or xylene (BTX) with OH, indicating that ring-cleavage pathways (bicycloalkyl radical) play a major role in OH-initiated oxidation of monocyclic aromatic VOCs 72 . The formation of primary glyoxal is considered as a marker for the bicycloalkyl radical pathway for benzene oxidation giving a lower limit for the branching ratio for the alkyl-substituted aromatics.

        <p>The NO-dependency of the products formed from the OH oxidation of aromatic compounds was also studied 62 . For all aromatic species, the bicyclic peroxy radical and bicyclic peroxide products were uniquely observed. As shown in Fig. 3, the bicyclic species are major products under NO-free conditions with yields ranging from 10 to 30%. It also shows that NO plays a role in the partitioning of the observed products between bicyclic and ring scission products (such as butenedial and methylbutendial for toluene specifically). The presence of NO leads to a higher proportion of ring scission products for each aromatic. The dienedial and epoxide products are observed as minor species in all systems, but not in the case of benzene. For the alkyl carbonyl products, this pathway is much more important for ethylbenzene than for the other alkylated aromatics, which is most likely due to the increased hydrogen abstraction pathway reactivity of the methylene group in ethylbenzene. Similarly, Sato et al. 77 reported the composition of SOA to be abundant with carboxylic acids or hydroxycarbonyls from benzene and 1,3,5-TMB oxidation.

Results also reported that oligomerisation is expected to be an important pathway for SOA formation from monocyclic aromatics. In addition, benzene and toluene were considered as the most important monocyclic aromatic precursors to SOA formation due to their high SOA yields. In addition, SOA products formed during o-, m-, and p-xylene photooxidation were compared by Zhang et al. 80 . This study found that the alkyl substitute position in xylene significantly affects SOA formation, and the effects of NO on the products formed during SOA growth were different for the three xylene isomers. Dicarbonyls, TBM (C 3 -trione + 2,3-butanedione + 3-methyl-2-oxiranecarbaldehyde), and highly oxidized species (HOS) were determined to be the predominant SOA components arising from xylene photooxidation 80 . High NO levels were noted to inhibit the formation of C3-trione and 2,3-butanedione in the SOA from m-and o-xylene, whereas the formation of 3-methyl-2oxiranecarbaldehyde during p-xylene photooxidation was significantly promoted.SOA components from the photooxidation of monocyclic aromatics were also investigated by Li et al. 79 and observed the formation of both carbonyls (ketone or aldehyde) and acids (carbonyl acid and hydroxycarbonyl) as seen previously 62,68,70,72,76 .

PAHs can be a potential contributor to the SOA budget, especially in urban areas 81,82 . The OH-initiated photooxidation of naphthalene was examined 85 , showing ring-opening products (e.g., 2-formylcinnamaldehyde, phthaldialdehyde, and phthalic anhydride) are the primary gas-phase products under high-NO x conditions via the RO 2 + NO pathway or a bicyclic peroxy mechanism. The low-NO x chemistry includes the formation of ringretaining compounds (e.g., naphthol, naphthoquinone, and epoxyquinone) via the RO 2 + HO 2 pathway 85 . Results also suggested that acidic compounds and organic peroxides account for a majority of identified high-and low-NO x SOA. Organic peroxides are found to contribute ~28 and 26% of the total high-NO x SOA and low-NO x SOA mass, respectively.

        <p>The above discussion illustrates that OH is central to oxidative processing of anthropogenic VOCs in the troposphere. However, the significance of Cl reactions in the Arctic lower troposphere, marine boundary layer and coastal regions has become apparent [87][88][89] . The rate constants of reactions of VOCs with Cl are a factor of ~10 2 higher than those with OH 90 , implying that even when tropospheric Cl concentrations are relatively low, reactions of VOCs with Cl can be competitive with or even exceed those of OH with VOCs. Similarly, volatile phenolic derivatives are most likely to be emitted from biomass burning and are also produced from the photooxidation of aromatic VOCs. These phenol derivatives can undergo rapid reactions with NO 3 at night and represent a significant source of SOA and brown carbon (BrC) in the atmosphere. Therefore, rapid atmospheric removal is expected upon reactions with OH during the day and NO 3 during the night, suggesting a key role of the NO 3 radical in VOCs oxidation.

        <p>Experiments investigating Cl atom-initiated oxidation of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and acenaphthene show phthalic anhydride and chloronaphthalene as the major products, indicating that both reaction pathways, H atom abstraction and Cl addition are important 91 , contrary to the findings reported by Wang et al. 92 . As an example, the proposed mechanism for the Cl atom initiated oxidation of naphthalene is given in Fig. 4. The Cl-naphthalene reaction could result in the formation of an RO 2 , chlorinated radical, chlorinated oxy radical and acyl radical, where the acyl radical can react with O 2 and then undergo cyclisation to form phthalic anhydride. Acenaphthenone is the main product observed from the reaction of Cl with acenaphthene, while 1,8naphthalic anhydride, acenaphthenone, acenaphthenequinone, and chloroacenaphthenone were identified as products of acenaphthylene oxidation. The identified oxidation products such as chloronaphthalene and chloroacenaphthenone can be used as potential markers for the Cl atom-initiated oxidation of PAHs. SOA formation from Cl-initiated oxidation of toluene under different conditions has also been investigated 93 . The difference between high and low NO x experiments specific to chlorineinitiated chemistry is the formation of ClNO 2 in the high NO x environment, which can result in decreased concentrations of Cl at the beginning of the experiment and also a sustained source of Cl throughout the rest of the experiment. In contrast, in low NO x experiments most Cl forms HCl, which is relatively stable to photolysis and does not result in significant recycling of Cl. The investigation also showed that bulk organic composition was different for SOA from Cl-dominated reactions compared to OHdominated reactions, including highly oxidised SOA formed through Cl-initiated reactions. The identified reaction products included benzenetriol, benzoquinone, benzaldehyde, phenols, and benzoic acid.Experiments investigating Cl atom-initiated oxidation of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and acenaphthene show phthalic anhydride and chloronaphthalene as the major products, indicating that both reaction pathways, H atom abstraction and Cl addition are important 91 , contrary to the findings reported by Wang et al. 92 .

        <p>The formation of organic chlorine upon reaction with alkanes occurs through the heterogeneous production of dihydrofuran via 1,4-hydroxycarbonyl uptake, acid-catalysed isomerization, and dehydration reactions (Fig. 5) 22,33 .

The reaction of C 11~14 n-alkanes with Cl atoms and O 2 led to the initial formation of RO, and further RO arose from three reaction pathways: reaction with O 2 to form carbonyls and continued reaction with the Cl atoms; an intramolecular hydrogen transfer reaction to form alkyl radicals; and decomposition reactions.

        <p>The reaction of resorcinol (1,3-benzenediol) with NO 3 resulted in a lower SOA yield than the OH oxidation 103 . This can be explained by differences in the reaction mechanisms as OH radicals primarily add to the aromatic ring to form a variety of low-volatility products, while reactions with NO 3 radicals occurred solely by abstraction of phenolic hydrogen to produce much more volatile nitroresorcinol and hydroxybenzoquinone products. The major oxidation products identified were benzenetriol, nitrobenzenetriol, and hydroxymuconic semialdehyde in the aerosol phase and hydroxybenzoquinone and nitroresorcinol in the gas phase.The reaction of resorcinol (1,3-benzenediol) with NO 3 resulted in a lower SOA yield than the OH oxidation 103 .

        <p>Organosulfates-a major SOA constituent This section is designed to provide a brief introduction to Organosulfates (OS) including their possible formation pathways. In addition, we also focus on the OS compounds identified from the oxidation of anthropogenic precursors such as alkanes and aromatics. During the past decade, OS has gained constant attention with studies reporting a high concentration of OS species in the ambient environment. However, estimates of OS concentrations and their role in atmospheric physicochemical processes are still associated with large uncertainties, suggesting the need for comprehensive research involving field, laboratory, and modelling approaches. The latest review performed by Brüggemann et al. 105 presents extensive information on the formation pathways of OS and their atmospheric relevance, transformations, reactivity, and fate in the atmosphere, and measurement techniques. In addition, the review also highlights a global overview on the OS measurements from different precursors.

        <p>OS are another important class of compounds and generally considered as potential markers for SOA formation under acidic conditions by aerosol-phase reactions with sulfuric acid 106 , formed by oxidation of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ). SO 2 is mainly of anthropogenic origin, which suggests the formation of OS can be significant in highly polluted regions around the globe. OS formation possibly occurs through a wider variety of formation mechanisms in the atmosphere, either via heterogeneous or via bulk aerosol-phase reactions, than initially expected. This includes epoxide pathways 107,108 , sulfate esterification reactions 109 , nucleophilic substitution 109,110 , sulfoxy radical reactions 111,112 , and heterogeneous reactions of SO 2 113 . The formation of OS via epoxide intermediates is kinetically possible under tropospheric conditions while, OS formation via a direct sulfate esterification pathway may occur rarely. The sulfate esterification needs to be conducted in the absence of water, which is unlikely in the real atmosphere. Despite this, lab studies have reported the formation of OS by direct sulfate esterification 109 , but expected to play a less important role in the atmosphere. The OS formation may also occur via nucleophilic substitution of alcohols with sulfuric acid 109,110 . As mentioned, an OS formation pathway is also linked with sulfoxy radical reactions in the aqueous phase via the addition of sulfoxy radicals to double bond molecules 114 or the reaction between a sulfate radical and an alkyl radical 111,112 . The second pathway (radicalradical reactions) is expected to be minor in the presence of dissolved oxygen. In addition, the formation of OS has been also reported through heterogeneous reactions where gas-phase SO 2 reacts with unsaturated hydrocarbons in the absence of gas-phase oxidant like OH or O 3 113 . Several studies have already indicated that OS could account for a substantial fraction (up to 30 %) of the organic mass measured in ambient PM 2.5 115 . Although most of the evidence for OS identification comes from field measurements [115][116][117] , only a few OS precursors have been characterised through laboratory studies. In most of the laboratory studies, OS has been identified in the presence of acidified sulfate seed aerosol from OH, NO 3 or O 3 oxidation of biogenic VOCs (BVOCs), including isoprene 106,118 , 2methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) 119,120 , unsaturated aldehydes [121][122][123] , monoterpenes 109,115 and sesquiterpenes 111,[124][125][126] . Only a few laboratory studies have reported OS formation from anthropogenic precursors 127,128 . However, Ma et al. 129 observed that aromatic OS could account for two-thirds of the OS mass identified in Shanghai. In addition, the formation of aliphatic OS was also reported in the ambient samples from other urban locations 116,117 , suggesting that gas-phase oxidation of long-chain or cyclic alkanes could be an important source of OS 116 .OS are another important class of compounds and generally considered as potential markers for SOA formation under acidic conditions by aerosol-phase reactions with sulfuric acid 106 , formed by oxidation of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ).

Similarly, the same outdoor smog chamber was used to study the OS formation from alkanes (dodecane, cyclodecane and decalin) photooxidation 128 . Most of the OS identified could be explained by reactive uptake of epoxides onto sulfate aerosol and/or heterogeneous reactions of hydroperoxides. However, OS formation via acid catalysed reactive uptake of epoxides has been observed only for cyclic alkanes. In (m/z 311), can be used as tracers for SOA production from the oxidation of alkanes in urban areas.

The yields of SOA formed from the reaction of OH with a series of acyclic (C 10 ), monocyclic (cyclodecane (C 10 H 20 )), polycyclic (decalin (C 10 H 18 ), pinane (C 10 H 18 ), tricyclo[5.2.1.0 2,6 ]decane (C 10 H 16 ), and adamantane (C 10 H 16 )) alkanes, were also examined to better understand the role of multiple cyclic moieties on SOA formation 24 . Results showed that the SOA yield for C 10 , cyclodecane, decalin, pinane, tricyclo[5.2.1.0 2,6 ]decane, adamantane ranged from 0.096-0.254, 0.964-1.37, 1.13-1.38, 0.38-0.396, 0.838-1.81 and 0.99-1.14, respectively. The SOA yields were also investigated from OH oxidation of selected alkanes (C 7 , C 10 , C 12 and decalin) under low-NO x condition in an OFR by Li et al. 35 .

        <p>Another environmental chamber experiment was carried out to investigate the Cl-initiated oxidation of n-alkanes (C 8-12 ) under high NO x by Wang and Hildebrandt Ruiz 94 . They showed that the observed SOA yields were higher for C 8 (0.16) and C 12 (1.65) than those resulted from OH-initiated oxidation (C 8 = 0.04; C 12 = 0.35). Under humid conditions, the bulk SOA production was found to be suppressed, though the SOA yields observed for Cl-initiated oxidation of C 8 (0.24), C 10 (0.50), and for C 12 (1.10) were still much higher than those observed for OH-initiated oxidation.Another environmental chamber experiment was carried out to investigate the Cl-initiated oxidation of n-alkanes (C 8-12 ) under high NO x by Wang and Hildebrandt Ruiz 94 .

        <p>Aromatic compounds mass yield. Izumi and Fukuyama 133 studied the photochemical aerosol formation from mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons and NO x by exposing the gas mixtures to simulated solar radiation in a simulation chamber with the aim of determining the aerosol yields. It was found that yields were greater for toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-and m-ethyltoluene (0.03, 0.031, 0.033 and 0.037, respectively) but lesser for parasubstituted toluene derivatives (&lt;0.015). The strong dependency of SOA yields on C OA were observed by Odum et al. 130 who showed that the yield for m-xylene and 1, 2, 4-TMB ranged from 0.19-10% and 2.6-9.67%, respectively. Their results also suggest the yield is higher at low temperatures for a given C OA . The SOA yields for 1, 2, 4-TMB derive from experiments conducted at temperatures from 22 to 26 °C. The yield values are like those for both the lower and higher temperature m-xylene at C OA below 60 µg m -3 . At C OA above 60 µg m -3 , the yields for 1, 2, 4-TMB are higher than those for the higher temperature m-xylene data and lower than those for the lower temperature m-xylene data. Thus, for most atmospherically relevant C OA values (i.e., ≤60 µg m -3 ), 1, 2, 4-TMB has a similar yield to m-xylene.Aromatic compounds mass yield.

        <p>In addition, an extensive series of sunlight radiated smog chamber experiments were performed with 17 individual aromatic species to determine their SOA yields 131 . The studied VOCs were divided into two distinct classes, namely low-(i.e., ≥ two methyl substituents) and high-yield (i.e., ≤ one methyl or ethyl substituents) aromatics. The SOA yields for low-and highyield aromatics ranged from 0.019-0.082 and 0.030-0.124, respectively. Similarly, the irradiation experiments conducted in the presence of NO x reported the largest SOA yield of 1.59 for toluene, followed by 1.09 for p-xylene and 0.41 for 1,3,5-TMB 134 . However, Edney et al. 19 observed a lower yield for toluene. The SOA yields were also investigated from the photooxidation of mxylene, toluene, and benzene under two limiting NO x conditions 25 . Under low-NO x conditions, the SOA yields for mxylene, toluene, and benzene are broadly constant (0.36, 0.30, and 0.37, respectively), indicating that the SOA formed is effectively nonvolatile under the range of organic mass concentration (&gt;10 µg m -3 ) studied, whereas under high-NO x conditions aerosol growth is immediate. Losses of semivolatiles by chemical reaction or to walls lead to lower SOA formation in chambers than in the atmosphere. Considering the slower oxidation rate observed in the photooxidation experiments performed by Odum et al. 130 and Odum et al. 131 , it is likely that their SOA yield parameters underestimate SOA formation from aromatic hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. Similarly, the SOA yield from xylene oxidation during m-xylene/NO x experiments showed that at lower NO x considerably more organic aerosol mass was generated than for those with higher NO x 135 . The observed SOA yield from xylene oxidation ranged from 0.032-0.141. In a similar experiments, Song et al. 75 investigated SOA formation from the photooxidation of xylene isomers (m-, p-, and o-xylenes), and found that the yield from xylenes ranged from 0.011 to 0.234, strongly depending upon the level of NO x . A similar SOA yield from the photooxidation of p-xylene in the presence of NO x was also reported by Healy et al. 136 . In addition, Lu et al. 137 investigated another xylene isomer and reported yields with seed (0.05-0.12) and no seed conditions (0.05-0.08), indicating higher yield in the presence of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 aerosols.In addition, an extensive series of sunlight radiated smog chamber experiments were performed with 17 individual aromatic species to determine their SOA yields 131 .

        <p>The enhanced SOA yields from 1,3,5-TMB oxidation under low NO x reported by Wyche et al. 76 indicate a role for oxygen-bridged species and organic acids during aerosol growth. The observed SOA yield ranged from 0.0621-0.0637 and 0.0029-0.0747 under low-and high-NO x , respectively. Sato et al. 77 showed the SOA yield from benzene to be higher, however, the yield measured (0.025) in one of the experiments was slightly lower than the SOA yield measured by Odum et al. 131 (0.036). SOA formation from the photooxidation of 12 C 8 and C 9 aromatic hydrocarbons under low-NO x was investigated 138 . Ortho isomers (0.044-0.237) have the highest SOA yield while para isomers (0.024-0.122) have the lowest SOA yield. The lower SOA yields for para isomers are consistent with previous observation by Izumi and Fukuyama 133 and Li et al. 79 . Also, SOA yields of benzene under comparable low- OH radical, chamber, low-NO x 0.0621-0.0637 Wyche et al. 76 Chamber, OH radical, NO x 0.025-0.156 Sato et al. 77 OH radical, chamber, low-NO x 0.007-0.065 Li et al. 138 1,2,4,5-Trimethylbenzene Chamber, OH radical 0.01-0.03 Li et al. 79 1,2,3-Trimethylbenzene OH radical, chamber, low-NO x 0.075-0.119 Li et al. 138 NO x were higher than those in Sato et al. 77 . A similar trend was also observed for SOA yields of toluene 139 . SOA yields were also estimated from PAHs oxidation. SOA formation from photooxidation of naphthalene, 1-MN, 2-MN, and 1,2-dimethylnaphthalene (1,2-DMN) were examined by Chan et al. 140 . This study found SOA yields were 0.19-0.30 for naphthalene, 0.19-0.39 for 1-MN, 0.26-0.45 for 2-MN, and 0.31 for 1,2-DMN under high-NO x and aerosol mass loadings (10-40 μg m -3 ). Under low-NO x , yields were 0.73, 0.68, and 0.58, for naphthalene, 1-MN, and 2-MN, respectively. More ringretaining products were observed in the gas phase under low-NO x , resulting in low volatility SOA and constant yields. Their results also showed the SOA yields for naphthalene and alkyl naphthalenes are on the order of 0.25-0.45 under high-NO x , which are about three times those of light aromatics. Shakya and Griffin 82 determined the aerosol yields for PAHs to be in the range of 0.02-0.22 with 0.20-0.30 uncertainty and in the following order: naphthalene (0.13), 1-MN (0.08), acenaphthylene (0.07), 2-MN (0.06), and acenaphthene (0.06), respectively. High yields for naphthalene may be attributed to larger concentrations of OH and initial ratios of hydrocarbons and NO (HC/NO) compared with the PAH experiments. In addition, the yields reported in their study are within the range of 0.25-0.40 for high NO x observed by Chan et al. 140 . In another study, the yields (Cl oxidation) were determined to be 0.91, 0.85, and 0.98 for naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and acenaphthene, respectively 91 , which is ~3 × higher than from OH oxidation 140 .The enhanced SOA yields from 1,3,5-TMB oxidation under low NO x reported by Wyche et al. 76 indicate a role for oxygen-bridged species and organic acids during aerosol growth.

        <p>The yields of SOA formed from reactions of catechol with OH and NO 3 radicals were 1.34 ± 0.2 and 1.50 ± 0.2 102 . These values are exceptionally high, considering that those measured for the photooxidation of simple aromatics ranged from about 0.01 to 0.78 shown above. The SOA yield reported for the OH radical-initiated reaction is much higher than the value of 0.53 reported previously by Borrás and Tortajada-Genaro 141 . In another study, Finewax et al. 103 investigated the SOA formation from resorcinol with OH and NO 3 , and SOA yields of 0.86 and 0.09, respectively were reported. Factors affecting SOA yields Aerosol yields are dependent on several parameters, such as the concentration of NO x in the system, the oxidation rate of the precursor, RH, temperature (T) and the type of seed aerosols used. Such factors can influence SOA yields from both anthropogenic and biogenic precursors, although the magnitude of the effect is dependent upon the properties of the individual reaction system. Lower volatile and reactive species are particularly affected by chamber walls losses, which can significantly impact SOA formation experiments as they involve highly reactive oxidants and the production of lower volatility products.The yields of SOA formed from reactions of catechol with OH and NO 3 radicals were 1.34 ± 0.2 and 1.50 ± 0.2 102 .

        <p>Effects of experimental conditions (i.e., temperature, RH, UV intensity). RH controls the liquid water content of the aerosols and thus the chemical or physical processes that involve water (i.e., reactant, product, or solvent) are affected 14 . However, the number of studies that have systematically investigated the impacts of RH on SOA formation are limited.

The effect of RH on SOA formation from the photooxidation of p-xylene was also studied at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature by Healy et al. 136 . They showed an increase in RH results in higher SOA yields and HONO formation, which leads to increased OH concentration. The OH concentration showed a gradual increase with RH and correlated with aerosol yields and RH. In addition, study of SOA formation from toluene and xylenes at different RH also found that increasing liquid water led to increasing SOA formation 143,144 .Effects of experimental conditions (i.e., temperature, RH, UV intensity).

        <p>The formation of SOA from benzene and ethylbenzene in the presence of NO x at different RH was also investigated 145 . Their results suggested that aqueous-phase reactions and the hydration from glyoxal could be enhanced under high RH conditions, leading to an increase in the formation of SOA from both benzene and ethylbenzene. Hinks et al. 29 studied the effect of RH on the chemical composition of SOA formed from low-NO x toluene oxidation and showed a significant loss in the amount of oligomers present in the SOA generated at 75% RH compared to that under dry conditions. In addition, their results also confirmed that low-NO x toluene SOA is more volatile when formed under high-RH conditions 29 . RH-induced oligomer suppression was also reported for Cl-initiated oxidation of n-alkanes (C 8-12 ) under high NO x 94 . SOA yields decreased (0.37 for decane and 0.20 for dodecane) under humid condition (35-67%), similar to the reduction reported in SOA yields for dodecane-OH SOA formation under humid conditions by Fahnestock et al. 31 . Similar results were also observed by Lamkaddam et al. 146 from high-NO x dodecane SOA formation. Their study reported a reduction in SOA yield by a factor of 2 as conditions went from dry (RH &lt; 1%) to more humid conditions (RH ≥ 5%). The role of water in SOA formation from the irradiation of a toluene-NO 2 system was also investigated by Jia and Xu 147 who reported that the yield of SOA from toluene almost doubled as RH was increased from 5 to 85 %, mainly due to the contribution of O-H-containing products, such as poly alcohols formed from aqueous reactions.The formation of SOA from benzene and ethylbenzene in the presence of NO x at different RH was also investigated 145 .

        <p>Temperature is another important factor affecting SOA formation due to its effect on both the vapour pressure of the SVOCs and the rate constants of the oxidation processes. Takekawa et al. 20 performed photooxidation experiments to study the temperature dependence of SOA formation from three aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., toluene, m-xylene and 1,2,4-TMB) and one alkane (i.e., n-undecane). Their results showed that a higher SOA yield (~2×) was obtained at 283 K than that at 303 K. In another study the dependence of aerosol mass yield on temperature was investigated in the toluene SOA system 30 , which also showed higher SOA yields at lower temperatures (284 K &gt; 305 K) under both low-and high-NO x , consistent with the previous observation 20 . These results all suggest that many of the oxidation products are semi-volatile and hence partition more extensively into the condensed phase at lower temperatures. An investigation of the temperature dependence of SOA yields for n-dodecane (C 12 H 26 ) in the presence of NO x with and without seed aerosol between 283.0-304.5 K (Fig. 7) showed no strong dependence 32 . This was attributed to a change of rate constants leading to different SOA composition, or non-volatile oxidation products.Temperature is another important factor affecting SOA formation due to its effect on both the vapour pressure of the SVOCs and the rate constants of the oxidation processes.

In another study the dependence of aerosol mass yield on temperature was investigated in the toluene SOA system 30 , which also showed higher SOA yields at lower temperatures (284 K &gt; 305 K) under both low-and high-NO x , consistent with the previous observation 20 . These results all suggest that many of the oxidation products are semi-volatile and hence partition more extensively into the condensed phase at lower temperatures. An investigation of the temperature dependence of SOA yields for n-dodecane (C 12 H 26 ) in the presence of NO x with and without seed aerosol between 283.0-304.5 K (Fig. 7) showed no strong dependence 32 . This was attributed to a change of rate constants leading to different SOA composition, or non-volatile oxidation products.</p>
        <p>UV intensity has also shown a positive effect on SOA yield 26,30 . SOA formed under high-and low-UV intensity showed similar composition as reported by Presto et al. 26 . High SOA yield was expected corresponding to more oxygenated products from increased radical cycling and multigenerational chemistry, but AMS data did not confirm this. In addition, Hildebrandt et al. 30 showed that the toluene SOA formation is sensitive to UV intensity.UV intensity has also shown a positive effect on SOA yield 26,30 .

        <p>Overall, most of the studies showed a positive effect of RH on SOA yields from aromatics through processes which can enhance the SOA formation by aqueous reactions [143][144][145]147,148 .

        <p>Effects of molecular structure. The effect of molecular structure/ alkyl group position on the measured SOA yield has been investigated 33 . SOA yields from OH radical-initiated reactions of alkanes in the presence of NO x increase with carbon number due to enhanced formation of non-volatile reaction products. The effect of carbon number of alkanes on SOA composition/yield was also investigated through the oxidation of a range of n-alkanes (C 10 -C 17 ) 57 . The relative contribution of first-generation cyclic hemiacetal gradually increased with n-alkane size, but the relative contribution of second generation and higher nitrate-containing species (i.e., hemiacetal nitrate and hemiacetal dinitrate) decreased with an increasing alkane size (carbon number). Also, larger decreases for C 11 were observed compared to C 17 with increasing RH, indicating that the SOA yield also depends on the size of the parent alkane.Effects of molecular structure.

        <p>Branched alkanes have lower yields than linear alkanes because of fragmentation and the formation of more volatile products. Cyclic alkanes have higher yields than linear alkanes due to the formation of less volatile ring opened products with an additional aldehyde group. The lower volatility of these products, and their tendency to form oligomers, appears to enhance SOA yields. Presto et al. 26 observed the positive influence of carbon number on SOA yields from n-alkanes (C 10 , C 12 , C 15 , and C 17 ) oxidation. SOA yield of branched alkanes also depends on the position of the methyl group on the carbon backbone as suggested by Tkacik et al. 27 . It is possible that a RO adjacent to a branch point predominantly undergoes decomposition leading to fragmentation, and forms products containing fewer carbon atoms that are likely to be too volatile to partition to the particle-phase.Branched alkanes have lower yields than linear alkanes because of fragmentation and the formation of more volatile products.

        <p>For aromatic precursors, alkyl substitution and the o-, m-and pposition affects the SOA yield 131,133 . Odum et al. 131 reported that the single-substituted aromatics might generate a higher ratio of ring-retaining to ring-cleavage products than the multiplesubstituted aromatics. Ring-retaining products may have lower vapour pressures than the smaller ring-cleavage products, resulting in higher yields for single-substituted aromatics. In addition, Li et al. 138 investigated the SOA yield from aromatic oxidation systems and concluded that ortho isomers have the highest SOA yield for similar aerosol concentrations, while para isomers have the lowest SOA yield, showing that SOA yields of aromatic hydrocarbons depends more on the substituent location than substituent length.For aromatic precursors, alkyl substitution and the o-, m-and pposition affects the SOA yield 131,133 .

        <p>Effects of aerosol seeds. Particle seed characteristics also play an important role in SOA formation.

        <p>However, Kroll et al. 149 and Lu et al. 137 observed that SOA yield was enhanced in the presence of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 seeds with RH at 4-7 and 56%.

Lu et al. 137 investigated the effect of inorganic seeds on SOA formation in irradiated mxylene/ NO x photooxidation systems and proposed that high concentrations of the seed aerosol and thin organic layers are the major factors in particle-phase heterogeneous reactions. The observation that the presence of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 seed particles impact SOA yields, where CaSO 4 and Ca(NO 3 ) 2 particles have no effect, is indicative that the acidic ammonium ion maybe playing a role in the heterogeneous reactions.

        <p>Kamens et al. 143 showed that experiments with higher initial seed concentrations (and particle phase water) generated more toluenederived SOA than the lower seed experiments. In addition, Zhou et al. 144 reported that increasing initial seed concentrations resulted in higher SOA yield in the o-, p-xylene, and toluene SOA system. Liu et al. 150 also investigated the SOA formation from toluene in the absence of NO x on initially wet or dry (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 seed particles. An increase in OH exposure from 0.47 × 10 11 to 5.28 × 10 11 molecules cm -3 s resulted in a decrease in the ratio of SOA mass yield on wet (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 seeds to that on dry (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 seeds from 1.31 to 1.01. Results showed a relatively higher SOA yield and higher oxidation state of SOA formed with initially wet (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 seeds including SOA composition being dominated by earlier generation products containing carbonyl groups at low OH exposure and by latergeneration products containing acidic groups at high OH exposures. In another study, experiments were conducted to assess the effect of seed particles on SOA formation from 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol) by Liu et al. 151 . With (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 and NaCl seed particles, SOA yield was enhanced by about 23 and 30%, respectively, which further increased to about 30-53% in the presence of SO 2 , suggesting that SO 2 and seed particles make a synergistic contribution to SOA formation.Kamens et al. 143 showed that experiments with higher initial seed concentrations (and particle phase water) generated more toluenederived SOA than the lower seed experiments.

        <p>Another important parameter is the level of NO x ; many studies have been conducted to define the influence of NO x on the SOA yield 25,80,135,140,[152][153][154][155] .

        <p>Ng et al. 25 showed that the SOA yields from the oxidation of aromatics under low-NO x is substantially higher than those under high-NO x . This is likely due to competition between RO 2 + NO (high-NO x ) and RO 2 + HO 2 (low-NO x ) reactions, suggesting the importance of RO 2 chemistry in SOA formation from BTX. Under high-NO x , the RO radical is produced from the reaction of RO 2 + NO which undergoes fragmentation to form higher volatility species, whereas under low-NO x , the carbon chain is preserved, resulting in higher yields when compared with those observed for high-NO x . Similar results were also noticed for the toluene and o-, m-and p-xylene isomers oxidation systems 80,154 . Chan et al. 140 also reported the formation of a higher fraction of ring-retaining products under low-NO x conditions from the oxidation of PAHs. The SOA was composed of semi-volatile products under high-NO x and nonvolatile under low-NO x . In a recent study, Yang et al. 155 showed that the SOA yield increases notably with larger NO x concentrations under low-NO x conditions during TMB photooxidation, while an opposite trend is observed in high-NO x experiments. The increase in SOA yield in the low-NO x regime was attributed to the increase of NO x -induced OH concentrations; the formation of low-volatility species might be suppressed, thereby leading to a lower SOA yield in high-NO x conditions.Ng et al. 25 showed that the SOA yields from the oxidation of aromatics under low-NO x is substantially higher than those under high-NO x .

        <p>For linear alkanes with &gt;6 carbon atoms, isomerization of RO is favoured over fragmentation reactions, or reaction with O 2 , subsequently resulting in the formation of lower volatility compounds than fragmentation products 22 . Loza et al. 23 observed similar SOA yields under low-and high-NO x conditions for the larger alkanes (C 12 ), 2-methylundecane, hexylcyclohexane, cyclododecane, suggesting that yields of SOA from alkane oxidation do not display a systematic NO x dependence. Recently, the roles of NO x were also investigated by generating individual RO via alkyl nitrite photolysis and measuring their product distributions 156 . Results show that lower-NO/NO 2 ratios promote the formation of secondary OH, peroxyacyl nitrates, and highly oxidized products that result in more SOA production.For linear alkanes with &gt;6 carbon atoms, isomerization of RO is favoured over fragmentation reactions, or reaction with O 2 , subsequently resulting in the formation of lower volatility compounds than fragmentation products 22 .

        <p>Effects of OA concentrations, VOC mixtures and TiO 2 . The dependence of SOA on OA mass concentration was studied by varying the amounts of VOCs such as m-xylene and p-xylene 158 . As VOC concentrations increased, the measured OA yield also increased. The OA mass formed in the PAM chamber was directly proportional to the VOC amount during the direct photooxidation of VOCs without seed particles or POA. This is likely due to an increase in the partitioning into the condensed phase which could enhance OA mass concentration 130,159 .Effects of OA concentrations, VOC mixtures and TiO 2 .

        <p>Effects of chamber walls and OH exposure. SOA yields are highly sensitive to experimental conditions, as well as corrections of the data for chamber wall losses 30,[162][163][164][165] . Investigations of gas-wall partitioning on SOA yield, that included the oxidation of C 8 -C 16 nalkanes, 1-alkenes, C 8 -C 13 2-alcohols and 2-ketones in Teflon chambers indicate that losses of OC to the walls can be large for SVOCs and could result in significant underestimation of SOA yields 162 . The possibility of further oxidation or particle-phase oligomer formation is reduced by the loss of gas-phase OC to the walls, thereby directly reducing the SOA yield. Experiments studying the toluene-NO x oxidation system demonstrated the underestimation of SOA formation by factors up to 4 due to losses of SOA-forming vapours to chamber walls 163 . In addition, gasphase wall losses for both types of chambers (continuous flow and batch) under similar conditions showed that the continuous flow experiments mitigate some effects of gas-phase wall losses with long (&gt;2 days) experiment run times 165 . These studies show that gas-phase wall losses still affect the absolute SOA yield for both types of chamber and warrant more investigation.Effects of chamber walls and OH exposure.

        <p>Perspective on factors affecting SOA yields. As discussed above many parameters affect aerosol yield. Generally, factors like RH, UV intensity, and initial OA mass concentration seem to have a positive influence on SOA formation while temperature, NO x , OH exposure, the presence of photocatalytic material and VOC mixture shows a negative effect. SOA yield was also found to be highly sensitive to the design of chamber walls, molecular structure of the individual precursor and the presence of seed aerosols. While the role of these parameters is relatively well understood for alkanes and the common mono/poly aromatics-OH oxidation system (using single precursor approach), most of the current challenges and uncertainties, by far, concern their role in real atmospheric conditions where SOA precursors are highly complex mixtures with different volatilities including the presence of other oxidants (e.g., Cl and NO 3 ). It is thus urgent to assess the effect of these parameters under the real atmospheric conditions by photo-oxidising dilutions from whole major emission sources, such as from vehicular exhaust or biomass burning (and not solely a specific compound from these sources).Perspective on factors affecting SOA yields.

        <p>In the previous section, we have discussed alkane and aromatic compound oxidation systems, including their reaction pathways, SOA forming potential (yield), and major reaction products. We briefly present here SOA formation from specific anthropogenic sources such as vehicular exhaust (diesel/gasoline), residential wood burning, cooking etc. Diesel exhaust is an important source of OA in the urban environment, primarily composed of light aromatics, PAHs and long-chain n-alkanes [167][168][169] . The gas-phase emissions from diesel exhaust are dominated by light aromatics, accounting for 27% of the SOA formed. The SOA contribution from PAHs can reach up to 54% from the oxidation of diesel emissions, representing a potentially large source of urban SOA 140 . Intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) are found to be a major component of diesel fuel and mainly exist as vapour in the atmosphere 170 . Results also suggest some of the first generation products of IVOC (diesel fuel) oxidation are vapours that can undergo multiple generations of oxidation. IVOCs also contribute similarly to the total SOA budget as PAHs, but higher (~4) than single-ring aromatics 27,171 . The findings also show twice as much SOA formation from diesel emissions after the inclusion of IVOCs as an SOA precursor. Therefore, IVOCs are likely an important source of SOA mass in the atmosphere. In addition, Fig. 8 SOA growth curves for toluene photooxidation in the presence of neutral seed versus acidic seed. Solid and hollow circles represent nonacidic and acidic seed condition (taken from Ng et al. 25 ).In the previous section, we have discussed alkane and aromatic compound oxidation systems, including their reaction pathways, SOA forming potential (yield), and major reaction products.

        <p>photooxidation of IVOCs also illustrates that the IVOCs are more likely to form oxygenated OA under high NO x conditions, contrary to the oxidation of traditional anthropogenic and biogenic SOA precursors for which reduced aerosol formation is observed at high NO x 172 . For gasoline exhaust, the emissions of PAHs compared to light aromatics are low, hence, their contribution to SOA formation is almost insignificant 173 . In another study, the ageing of gasoline exhaust was performed using a mobile environmental reaction chamber 174 . Results illustrated that a modern gasoline car can lead to the formation of significantly higher SOA than the emitted primary aerosol mass. Du et al. 175 reported higher SOA production from gasoline exhaust, showing a greater contribution of IVOCs and SVOCs to the SOA formation. Similarly, another experimental study with gasoline exhaust also showed the formation of higher amounts of IVOCs and SVOC, which promoted the GPP and SOA formation 176 . It has also been shown that with the increase of aromatic content in gasoline exhaust from 23 to 50%, an enhancement was reported in the SOA yield by a factor of 4.0-6.7 176 . Residential wood combustion can contribute considerably to the atmospheric OA/SOA burden, particularly in regions with cooler climates, and contribute up to ~80% of the total observed SOA 177 . Cooking may also be a potential source of SOA because of the abundant emissions of non-methane organic gases 178 . It has also been shown that the alkenals, which are not traditional SOA precursors accounted for 5 -34% of the observed SOA 179 . In addition, SOA formation from gas-phase emissions of heated oils were also investigated 178 , showing the major SOA precursors were linked to the content of monounsaturated fat and omega-6 fatty acids present in cooking oils. In another study, SOA formation from heated oils also suggested that the major precursor was aldehyde, which accounted for a majority of the oxidation products from cooking emissions 180 . Additionally, there is a growing concern with SOA formation from non-combustion anthropogenic sources (e.g., coatings, adhesives, cleaning agents, printing inks, pesticides, and personal care products), which may contribute a substantial amount of VOCs to the atmosphere and subsequently results in SOA production 181 . However, many of these chemicals are currently not included in the emission inventories and require better quantification.photooxidation of IVOCs also illustrates that the IVOCs are more likely to form oxygenated OA under high NO x conditions, contrary to the oxidation of traditional anthropogenic and biogenic SOA precursors for which reduced aerosol formation is observed at high NO x 172 .

        <p>The optical properties of SOA and their effects on the global radiative balance remains poorly understood. Refractive index (RI) is one of the most important parameters when describing aerosol optical properties as it accounts for other optical factors, such as scattering and extinction efficiencies. RIs measured of seeded aerosols are a little lower than those under non-seeded conditions in low-NO x environments, but are higher for high-NO x environments 56 . This was the case most noticeably for dodecane derived SOAs when comparing SOA derived from other long-chain alkanes. Measured RI values generally ranged from 1.33 to 1.57 (i.e., 1.33-1.54 for C 12 , 1.40-1.57 for C 15 and 1.41-1.53 for C 17derived SOAs). Long-chain alkanes, a major contributor to IVOC, may contribute largely to the optical properties of SOAs. Multiphase processes can also affect the RI and light-extinction of mxylene-derived SOA. They can significantly enhance the RI due to oligomerisation processes that results in an increase of the lightscattering efficiency and direct radiative forcing by ~20-90% 182 .The optical properties of SOA and their effects on the global radiative balance remains poorly understood.

        <p>The optical properties of m-xylene-derived SOA are affected by GPP. As organic mass increases and the particles grow, the proportions of SVOCs and IVOCs in the aerosol phase change resulting in a decrease of SOA RI by 0.09 ± 0.02 without seeds and 0.15 ± 0.02 with seeds 183 . Pre-existing seeds could promote condensation and could inhibit the formation of some highmolecular-weight products, like highly oxygenated multifunctional compounds (HOMs), leading to a further decrease of the RI. In addition, the optical properties of SOA particles are related to the total organic mass and molecular composition. Similarly, the optical properties of n-dodecane SOA showed that low temperatures could enhance the real part of the RI at wavelengths of 532 and 375 nm due to the formation of large amounts of oligomers 184 .The optical properties of m-xylene-derived SOA are affected by GPP.

        <p>Experiments investigating the effect of different experimental conditions (i.e., dry, dry with SO 2 , wet and wet with SO 2 ) on the composition and optical properties of toluene-derived SOA showed that an increase in the RH enhances both light absorption and the scattering property of the SOA, possibly due to the formation of oligomers through multiphase reactions 185 . The addition of SO 2 resulted in a decrease in the real part of the RI of toluene-derived SOA, probably due to the partitioning of lowoxidation products. The extinction coefficients of toluene-derived SOA with SO 2 increased by ~30% under wet conditions compared to dry conditions.Experiments investigating the effect of different experimental conditions (i.e., dry, dry with SO 2 , wet and wet with SO 2 ) on the composition and optical properties of toluene-derived SOA showed that an increase in the RH enhances both light absorption and the scattering property of the SOA, possibly due to the formation of oligomers through multiphase reactions 185 .

        <p>The average carbon oxidation state (OS C ) is widely used to describe the degree of oxidation of atmospheric organic species 186 . Briefly, the OS C is defined as the charge a carbon atom would acquire if it loses all electrons with more electronegative atoms but gains all electrons with less electronegative atoms. Liu et al. 151 reported that SO 2 was found to favour an increase of the OS C of SOA formed from methoxyphenol oxidation, indicating that a functionalisation reaction is dominant over oligomerisation and leads to the formation of highly oxidised products with relatively low volatility, which consequently result in an increase in OS C and SOA yields. The formation and ageing of SOA from the photooxidation of toluene and other small aromatics were also studied 187 . Higher exposure to OH resulted in a different OA composition with high OS C and SOA mass yield and reduced SOA volatility. The OS C generally increased during photooxidation ranging from 0.16-0.29 for final oxidation products 187 . The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) potential of aerosols is a function of their hygroscopicity 188 . Hildebrandt Ruiz et al. 187 reported no clear correlation between hygroscopicity and O:C or between hygroscopicity and OS C in the toluene photooxidation system, contrary to the conventional view that suggests oxidative ageing of aerosol has a positive effect on hygroscopicity 189 . This is possible either due to the presence of surface-active compounds or if the OA is mostly composed of compounds with similar OS C but different molecular size (e.g., oligomers), as the size of molecules affects their solubility and hence their hygroscopicity. It has also been reported that OS C is a better indicator of aerosol oxidation than O:C as the latter may have some influence from non-oxidative processes (i.e., hydration and dehydration) while OS C increases continually with oxidation 186,187 . In another study, experiments investigating the relationship between the oxidation level and hygroscopic properties of SOA particles confirmed that the hygroscopic growth varied linearly with O:C, but the CCN activity mostly followed a nonlinear trend 190 .The average carbon oxidation state (OS C ) is widely used to describe the degree of oxidation of atmospheric organic species 186 .

        <p>The physical phase state (e.g., solid, semisolid or liquid) of SOA particles can significantly affect a number of atmospheric processes, such as gaseous uptake, particle-phase rate of reaction, GPP equilibrium and ageing [191][192][193] . For example, the diffusion of molecules within the bulk of a viscous particle is comparatively slow and may become the rate-limiting step. The water uptake of highly viscous SOA particles may not occur at low temperatures, which has a significant influence on particle size and scattering properties 193,194 . The RH-dependent viscosities at room temperature of SOA particles produced from toluene photooxidation indicate that the toluene-derived SOA particles are in the liquid phase at RH &gt; 60% 195 . Saukko et al. 192 investigated the phase state of laboratory-generated SOA produced in a flow tube reactor by photooxidation of anthropogenic precursors, naphthalene and nheptadecane. Their measurements of the bounced fraction (BF) suggests that SOA particles are in an amorphous solid or semisolid state at RH &lt; 60%. SOA particles generated from naphthalene showed a decrease in the BF from 0.65 ± 0.1 at RH &lt; 50% to 0.4 ± 0.1 at RH = 64 %, suggesting a decrease in viscosity possibly due to an RH-induced phase change from solid to liquid-like particles. Unlike the naphthalene SOA system, n-heptadecane SOA has a low BF indicating liquid-like, less viscous particles at low oxidation levels 181 .

        <p>Koop et al. 193 have suggested that the oligomerisation and polymerisation processes should be given greater consideration as they will affect the physical state of organic aerosols beyond the decrease in vapour pressure. Oligomerisation may result in a strong increase in viscosity and the formation of semisolid state aerosols, which has implications for heterogeneous oxidation reactions and the extended atmospheric lifetime of SOA particles 193 . Several other studies have also shown that laboratory-produced SOA particles have an amorphous solid state 191,[196][197][198] . However, recent studies are predominantly based on biogenic precursors suggesting that more studies using anthropogenic precursors are required to better evaluate the change in SOA properties and their impact on the urban environment.Koop et al. 193 have suggested that the oligomerisation and polymerisation processes should be given greater consideration as they will affect the physical state of organic aerosols beyond the decrease in vapour pressure.

        <p>Flow reactors (e.g., PAM) and smog chambers have both been used extensively to study SOA formation for a variety of atmospherically relevant conditions and emission sources. However, large-scale smog chambers age pollutant mixtures over the course of hours to days, whereas flow reactors rapidly age the mixtures in seconds to minutes. They do this by using high oxidant concentrations to achieve higher degrees of oxygenation, which may affect the atmospheric relevance of the generated products. In addition, the ability of flow reactors to simulate slow atmospheric processes, like condensed phase reactions, is also of concern. The chemical composition and yields of the oxidation products formed from the photooxidation of α-pinene and of wood-combustion emissions were generally consistent in both PAM and smog chamber 199 . However, the yields during the PAM experiments for the α-pinene system were slightly lower than those in the smog chamber due to increasing wall losses of gasphase species as PAM has a higher surface area to volume ratio. Similarly, an intercomparison study of SOA generated from gasphase precursors in a PAM and several environmental chambers showed a similar SOA composition across all systems, whether low OH concentrations are used over long exposure times (chamber) or high OH concentrations over short exposure times (PAM) 200 . The use of acidic seed particles in the flow reactor increased the yield of SOA by a factor of 3-5, where seed particles are routinely used in the chambers. The study also highlights that both, flow reactors and chambers, are capable of characterising SOA ageing mechanisms representative of ambient conditions. Despite concerns, flow reactors are likely to remain within the study of atmospheric ageing as they produce a high, consistent and reproducible output, are mobile and age aerosols over short timescales, all very convenient attributes for laboratory studies. More intercomparison studies with varying atmospheric conditions for both types of reactors should be considered when evaluating their use within aerosol aging experiments, as commercially available PAM chambers have gained rapid popularity due to their ease of use within field and laboratory experiments.Flow reactors (e.g., PAM) and smog chambers have both been used extensively to study SOA formation for a variety of atmospherically relevant conditions and emission sources.

        <p>Most of our knowledge about SOA formation from anthropogenic VOCs (i.e., alkanes, aromatics, alkenes) derives from laboratory studies. These studies are designed to mimic atmospheric conditions using large simulation chambers (also known as smog chambers) or aerosol flow reactors. In general, the potentials of compounds to form SOA are measured using experiments with a single precursor approach 130,201 . However, in reality, SOA precursors occur within packets of air as highly complex mixtures of VOCs and SVOCs with different volatilities 202 . As a result, using a single-species approach for studying SOA formation is not atmospherically representative, especially in the urban environment. Some studies have been performed to avoid issues with the single-species approach by photo-oxidising whole vehicular exhaust or biomass burning emissions 170,177,[203][204][205][206][207][208] . Tiitta et al. 205 and Bruns et al. 177 investigated the SOA formation from fuel-wood-burning emissions and wiregrass fires and found pyrogenic VOCs (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, and toluene) and furans were significant precursors for SOA production. This is in contrast to the findings of Ahern et al. 203 , who investigated SOA formation in smoke from the open burning of various biomass fuels representative of canopy and grassland fires and observed significant OA mass enhancement from fuels representing canopy fires containing significant amounts of volatile precursors, such as monoterpenes. Their experiments were conducted using freshly harvested branches of coniferous canopy fuels, a species known as monoterpene emitters 209,210 . Similarly, the OH-initiated ageing of biomass burning emissions was also investigated 204 , showing the formed SOA is found to be highly variable and the observed variability may be related to the initial total non-methane organic vapour concentration and OH exposure. In addition, experiments investigating the ageing of emissions from flaming and smouldering-dominated wood fires showed single-ring and polycyclic aromatics are major precursors in flaming emissions, while furans are important SOA precursors in smouldering fires 206 . Results also suggest that the oxidation products from lignin pyrolysis are likely to dominate SOA formation, which does not depend on the combustion or ageing conditions.Most of our knowledge about SOA formation from anthropogenic VOCs (i.e., alkanes, aromatics, alkenes) derives from laboratory studies.

Experiments with light-duty gasoline vehicle exhaust suggest that the catalyst warm-up is an important factor in controlling SOA precursor emissions 207 . In addition, the majority (&lt;50%) of measured SOA from diesel emissions can be explained by traditional SOA precursors while the rest (~30 %) may originate from the non-methane organic gas emissions 208 .

        <p>Additionally, laboratory studies have identified linear, branched, and cyclic alkanes with carbon numbers ranging from C 7 to C 25 as possible SOA precursors while monoaromatics (i.e., benzene, toluene, xylene, TMB) are the most common aromatic precursors as discussed in the previous sections.

        <p>A number of advanced instruments such as PILS-WSOC (Particle in Liquid Sampler-Water Soluble Organic Carbon) 213 AMS/ACSM (Aerosol chemical speciation monitor) 39,214 , TAG-AMS (thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph-AMS) 215 , EESI-TOF-MS (extractive electrospray ionization-time of flight-MS) [216][217][218][219] , PTR-MS (proton-transfer reaction-MS) or CIMS (chemical ionization MS) 220 , are available to quantify OM at a high time resolution (i.e., minutes or seconds). These techniques have been used in many field studies and are able to separate SOA from POA. The online techniques often reduce the likely errors that are introduced by filter-based measurements as the latter are performed over several hours to days, making it challenging to differentiate atmospheric processes. However, the deployment of these instruments for long periods is labour intensive and expensive. In addition, the identification of SOA from different sources may not be always possible as the mass fragments from the ionisation of molecules in mass spectrometry do not often represent a signature for a particular precursor or source. However, this is not always the case as instruments like CIMS or EESI-TOF-MS with good massresolution use softer ionization methods. Therefore, at present, the combination of available methods during field campaigns is highly recommended for a complete overview.A number of advanced instruments such as PILS-WSOC (Particle in Liquid Sampler-Water Soluble Organic Carbon) 213 AMS/ACSM (Aerosol chemical speciation monitor) 39,214 , TAG-AMS (thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph-AMS) 215 , EESI-TOF-MS (extractive electrospray ionization-time of flight-MS) [216][217][218][219] , PTR-MS (proton-transfer reaction-MS) or CIMS (chemical ionization MS) 220 , are available to quantify OM at a high time resolution (i.e., minutes or seconds).

        <p>There have been several improvements made in the parameterizations used for atmospheric modelling since the last decade, such as revisions in SOA yields of different precursors based on chamber studies under varying conditions and the use of a new framework (volatility basis set 'VBS' approach) to handle the complexities of SOA formation, reaction, and volatility in order to understand the thermodynamics of mixed inorganic-organic systems 4 . SOA formation has been represented using two approaches in the atmospheric models; empirical models (based on laboratory data) [221][222][223] , and explicit/semi-explicit models (e.g., Master Chemical Mechanism) 224,225 . The heterogeneous reactions involving neutral to highly acidic aerosols are not very well accounted for in the existing SOA models. As a result, the current models mostly underestimate SOA mass in comparison with what is typically observed 7,201 . This could be also due to some missing SOA precursors, mostly anthropogenic, such as IVOCs and PAHs 27 . A modelling study, which attempted to parametrize SOA formation from alkanes and PAHs, showed 20-30% of total SOA produced from these precursors 226 . SVOCs or IVOCs are also not included in current emissions inventories and could be an important SOA precursor. In addition, the oxidation of existing POA or oxidation of semi-volatile SOA in the gas phase may enhance SOA formation from anthropogenic hydrocarbons. Bruns et al. 177 characterized primary and aged emissions from residential wood burning and showed that traditional SOA precursors account for only ~3-27% of the observed SOA, but ~84-116% of the SOA can be explained by including non-traditional precursors in models.There have been several improvements made in the parameterizations used for atmospheric modelling since the last decade, such as revisions in SOA yields of different precursors based on chamber studies under varying conditions and the use of a new framework (volatility basis set 'VBS' approach) to handle the complexities of SOA formation, reaction, and volatility in order to understand the thermodynamics of mixed inorganic-organic systems 4 .

        <p>Overall, this discussion suggests that atmospheric models still require experimental data to parameterise SOA formation from different precursors, followed by evaluation using field data.Overall, this discussion suggests that atmospheric models still require experimental data to parameterise SOA formation from different precursors, followed by evaluation using field data.</p>
        <p>Integrated studies-laboratory/modelling/field Despite rigorous research, several issues are emerging which can only be addressed via an integrated approach combining laboratory, field and modelling studies. For example, Xu et al. 227 combined all three approaches to investigate sources of OA and better constrain the OA budget. Their lab-in-the-field experiments reported that formed SOA from biogenic VOCs (α-pinene and βcaryophyllene) can be used as a proxy to apportion low oxygenated OA in the Southeastern US. In addition, their model also reproduces the magnitude and diurnal variability of low oxygenated OA measured at multiple sites in the Southeastern US. Their results also highlight that an integrated approach can facilitate the study of SOA formation under realistic atmospheric conditions, and improve atmospheric models which can be used on a large spatial scale to assess the sources of OA/SOA. Lamkaddam et al. 228 designed a study to investigate the aqueous-phase processing of isoprene oxidation products in cloud droplets using a similar approach. They integrate their experimental findings into a global model and reported that clouds significantly increase the amount of SOA. Similarly, Bruns et al. 177 . showed an improvement in the total SOA budget by including non-traditional precursors identified using laboratory experiments. Their findings suggest that identifying the main precursors responsible for SOA formation from residential wood burning enables improved model parameterizations for SOA contribution. However, such integrated studies are few and require more attention, especially those focusing on AVOCs.Integrated studies-laboratory/modelling/field Despite rigorous research, several issues are emerging which can only be addressed via an integrated approach combining laboratory, field and modelling studies.

        <p>Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the formation and properties of ASOAs, but substantial gaps remain that present challenges for accurate characterization of the role of ASOAs in environmental degradation and climate. A better understanding of SOA chemical and physical properties is required to improve the modelling of global OA budgets. Thus, a major goal is to investigate/improve simulation of missing ASOA in atmospheric models through laboratory and field studies.Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the formation and properties of ASOAs, but substantial gaps remain that present challenges for accurate characterization of the role of ASOAs in environmental degradation and climate.

        <p>As outlined, in most of the studies reactions with OH are the dominant initial transformation pathway for AVOCs in the troposphere, although the importance of Cl reactions in the Arctic regions, marine and coastal areas have become apparent due to the rapid rate of reaction with SOA precursors. Additionally, reactions with NO 3 at night may represent a significant source of SOA and BrC formation in the atmosphere. Reaction pathways linked to Cl/NO 3 initiated oxidation of different AVOCs have not received as much attention and probably should be considered as a newly emerging focus of future research.As outlined, in most of the studies reactions with OH are the dominant initial transformation pathway for AVOCs in the troposphere, although the importance of Cl reactions in the Arctic regions, marine and coastal areas have become apparent due to the rapid rate of reaction with SOA precursors.

        <p>Another important line of research is the role of autoxidation reactions. The rapid autoxidation of RO 2 formed during VOC oxidation results in HOMs that efficiently form SOA. However, most previous work is based on biogenic precursors (e.g., terpenes and sesquiterpenes) [229][230][231] .

        <p>As the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons can rapidly form HOMs with extremely low volatility, it makes aromatic hydrocarbons a potential contributor to nucleation events observed in the urban environment 232,233 . There is a possibility that the study of these phenomena in highly pollutant environments may aid in discovering some new pathways for SOA formation chemistry.As the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons can rapidly form HOMs with extremely low volatility, it makes aromatic hydrocarbons a potential contributor to nucleation events observed in the urban environment 232,233 .

        <p>Photochemical ageing of aerosols results in a change to aerosol composition and physical properties through various chemical and physical processes 234 . For example, UV-induced photodegradation can reduce the average size, mass and volatility distribution of SOA compounds resulting from photoinduced fragmentation and serve as a source of oxygenated VOCs 235,236 . This will cause SOA to scatter sunlight less efficiently, which in turn affects the Earth's climate. Alternatively, certain photochemical processes occurring on the surfaces of aerosol particles can also increase the average size and complexity of particulate organics 237 . Condensed-phase photochemical processes may produce a gaseous species comparable to its primary sources and could therefore measurably affect the budgets of both particulate and gaseous atmospheric organic compounds on a global scale. These processes are not fully characterised or accurately included in the global models. For example, Hodzic et al. 238 showed that the inclusion of condensed-phase photolysis in a global model can potentially result in ~50% of particle mass loss after 10 days of ageing with an assumption that condensed-phase photolysis of organics occurs at the same rate as in the gas-phase. Another recent combined experimental and modelling study also predicted about a 50% reduction in biogenic SOA due to SOA photodegradation 239 . This suggests the study of photochemical processes in the highly polluted environment through field campaigns, or of photochemical processes linked to AVOCs oxidation in the laboratory chambers can potentially aid in closing the SOA budget.Photochemical ageing of aerosols results in a change to aerosol composition and physical properties through various chemical and physical processes 234 .

        <p>Finally, we conclude that our knowledge on SOA formation from AVOCs precursors is far from being complete. More integrated studies (laboratory/modelling/field) are needed to improve atmospheric models to capture the magnitude and variability of SOA to assess the impact on aerosol climate effects. Laboratory studies should include mixtures of precursors to simulate atmospheric conditions as closely as possible.Finally, we conclude that our knowledge on SOA formation from AVOCs precursors is far from being complete.
