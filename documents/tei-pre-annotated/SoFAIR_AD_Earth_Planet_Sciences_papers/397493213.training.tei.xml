        <p>Current consensus on global climate change predicts warming trends with more pronounced temperature changes in winter than summer in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitudes. Moderate increases in soil temperature are generally related to faster rates of soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition in Northern ecosystems, but there is evidence that SOC stocks have remained remarkably stable or even increased on the Tibetan Plateau under these conditions. This intriguing observation points to altered soil microbial mediation of carbon-cycling feedbacks in this region that might be related to seasonal warming. This study investigated the unexplained SOC stabilization observed on the Tibetan Plateau by quantifying microbial responses to experimental seasonal warming in a typical alpine meadow. Ecosystem respiration was reduced by 17%-38% under winter warming compared with year-round warming or no warming and coincided with decreased abundances of fungi and functional genes that control labile and stable organic carbon decomposition. Compared with year-round warming, winter warming slowed macroaggregate turnover rates by 1.6 times, increased fine intra-aggregate particulate organic matter content by 75%, and increased carbon stabilized in microaggregates within stable macroaggregates by 56%.

        <p>Warming patterns caused by climate change are not equal across seasons (Piao et al., 2010;Suonan et al., 2017). Non-growing winter seasons experience larger temperature increases than summer growing seasons, especially in high-latitude, temperature-sensitive areas (Kreyling et al., 2019;Piao et al., 2010). This "asymmetric seasonal warming" (with the most significant temperature increase in winter) has been evident on the Tibetan Plateau over the last several decades (Li et al., 2010;Liu &amp; Chen, 2000).Warming patterns caused by climate change are not equal across seasons (Piao et al., 2010;Suonan et al., 2017).

        <p>The Tibetan Plateau holds 30-40 Gt of soil organic carbon (SOC), which accounts for 2%-3% of the global SOC stock (Shang et al., 2016). Increased losses of SOC to the atmosphere as CO 2 across this vast area, caused by accelerated microbial decomposition driven by warming, could constitute an important positive feedback to further climate change. The average temperature increase in the region is approximately twice the average global warming rate (Chen et al., 2013) and winter temperatures have risen by 0.3°C per decade in the winter compared with 0.2°C during the summer (Li et al., 2010;Lu &amp; Liu, 2010). Despite this tangible warming trend, there is evidence that topsoil SOC stocks have remained remarkably stable (Chen et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2018;Yang et al., 2009) or even increased (Ding et al., 2017). This suggests that the underlying processes controlling the capacity of Tibetan grasslands to maintain SOC stocks under global warming are not fully understood and require investigation.The Tibetan Plateau holds 30-40 Gt of soil organic carbon (SOC), which accounts for 2%-3% of the global SOC stock (Shang et al., 2016).

        <p>The regulation of SOC turnover is increasingly conceptualized as part of a dynamic soil pore system, where the construction and destruction of pores control SOC availability to decomposing agents in the context of global change challenges (Franko &amp; Schulz, 2020;Kravchenko et al., 2019). Long-term physical protection of SOC through aggregation afforded by the enmeshment of mineral particles by biological agents is widely recognized (Lehmann et al., 2017;Rillig &amp; Mummey, 2006;Six et al., 2002;Tisdall &amp; Oades, 1982). The association of microbial "necromass" (e.g., amino sugars from the residues of fungal and bacterial cell walls) and mineral-associated fractions (Glaser et al., 2006;Gunina et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 1998) represents a direct link between the stabilizing action of biota and microbial anabolism as a major contributor to the stable SOC pool (Kallenbach et al., 2016) that is incorporated into conceptual models and experiments (Gunina et al., 2014;Liang et al., 2017;Sokol et al., 2019). Nevertheless, despite the acknowledged stability of mineralassociated carbon, it is vulnerable to climate change.The regulation of SOC turnover is increasingly conceptualized as part of a dynamic soil pore system, where the construction and destruction of pores control SOC availability to decomposing agents in the context of global change challenges (Franko &amp; Schulz, 2020;Kravchenko et al., 2019).

        <p>Soil warming experiments, for example at the Harvard Forest (Pold et al., 2017), and an annual grassland in California (Liang &amp; Balser, 2012;Rillig et al., 2002) revealed the depletion of mineralassociated organic carbon. This is because increased temperature shifts the sorption-desorption balance toward desorption (Conant et al., 2011) and decreases supplies of carbon as energy source and organic substances that bind soil particles together (Giovannini et al., 1988). However, the effects of soil warming in mesic regions may be different from that at high latitudes in (semi)arid alpine regions, where warming is often accompanied by severe summer droughts and frequent soil drying and rewetting, or freezing and thawing in winter and spring. Increasing intensity and duration of dry periods may progressively preserve SOC stocks (Borken &amp; Matzner, 2009) through the formation of new and/or stronger organo-mineral interactions (Kaiser et al., 2015) and may stabilize aggregates rather than disrupt them (Denef et al., 2001;Najera et al., 2020). Continuous warming led to increase of mineral-associated carbon along with suppressed soil respiration in a semiarid grassland (Bai et al., 2020). Microorganisms have specific adaptations depending on the local climate; for example, fungi in arid grasslands are less sensitive to drought than those in temperate grasslands (Ochoa-Hueso et al., 2018), and this will influence the amount and stability of the microbial necromass (Ding et al., 2019;Liang &amp; Balser, 2012). For instance, in cold, wet alpine ecosystems, plants may take up more nitrogen in the warmer growing season, while microbial nitrogen pools increase later in the year (Edwards &amp; Jefferies, 2010;Jaeger III et al., 1999;Kuzyakov &amp; Xu, 2013) potentially alleviating competition for nitrogen in the cooler non-growing season. Thus, the tendency toward SOC stabilization observed in the warming Tibetan Plateau may be a product of the effects of climate on soil physical, biogeochemical, and microbiological processes.Soil warming experiments, for example at the Harvard Forest (Pold et al., 2017), and an annual grassland in California (Liang &amp; Balser, 2012;Rillig et al., 2002) revealed the depletion of mineralassociated organic carbon.

        <p>Manipulation experiments simulating climate change commonly apply uniform warming treatments (Jia et al., 2019;Ma et al., 2018), "necromass" (amino sugars) concentrations in soil under winter warming coincided with a 12% increase in carboxyl-C. These results indicate the enhanced physical preservation of SOC under winter warming and emphasize the role of soil microorganisms in aggregate life cycles. In summary, the divergent responses of SOC persistence in soils exposed to winter warming compared to year-round warming are explained by the slowing of microbial decomposition but increasing physical protection of microbially derived organic compounds. Consequently, the soil microbial response to winter warming on the Tibetan Plateau may cause negative feedbacks to global climate change and should be considered in Earth system models.Manipulation experiments simulating climate change commonly apply uniform warming treatments (Jia et al., 2019;Ma et al., 2018), "necromass" (amino sugars) concentrations in soil under winter warming coincided with a 12% increase in carboxyl-C.

To disentangle the processes caused by the observed temperature increases at different times of year on the Tibetan Plateau, a specific winter warming treatment was imposed in addition to a year-round warming treatment that would allow the identification and isolation of physical (soil aggregate size), chemical (labile and stable organic carbon pools), and biological (community structure and carbon degradation genes) processes specifically related to winter warming in this study.

        <p>To further investigate the relationship between R eco with environmental variables and biogeochemical processes, partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis was performed. PLS-PM is a data analysis method for variables that can be summarized by using latent variables, and the fact that linear relationships exist between latent variables (Sanchez, 2013). Models with different structures are evaluated using the goodness of fit (GOF) statistics, a measure of their overall predictive power, with GOF &gt; 0.7 considered acceptable values (Sanchez, 2013). The models were constructed using the "inner plot" function of the

The environmental drivers selected in the model were the main predictors according to their contribution for variation based on Random Forest analysis (% of increase of MSE). Based on the importance and the maximum explanation for variations of R eco , the environmental drivers selected in the model include soil water and temperature, carbon degradation genes, fungal residue, aboveground biomass, bacterial/fungal ratio, and aggregate size fractions (non-aggregated silt and clay, mM, mM-silt and clay; Figure S3).

Persistent moisture deficits in warmed soils may subsequently reduce soil CO 2 efflux and microbial biomass content (Liu et al., 2009;Quan et al., 2019). Thus, the reduction in R eco with warming may be due to a consequence of inhibition of microbial respiration or substrate supply as well as suppression of physiological activity by warminginduced soil water deficits (Niu et al., 2008).Soil moisture is an important factor regulating large-scale spatial patterns of R eco in Tibetan alpine grasslands (Geng et al., 2012) and inconsistent effects of experimental warming on soil CO 2 flux that are related to interannual fluctuations in rainfall have been reported in semiarid steppe grasslands (Liu et al., 2009).

Thus, the reduction in R eco with warming may be due to a consequence of inhibition of microbial respiration or substrate supply as well as suppression of physiological activity by warminginduced soil water deficits (Niu et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>Physiological stress and constraints on enzyme production due to reduced water availability (Tiemann &amp; Billings, 2011) are likely to have contributed strongly to the decrease of carbon decomposition genes in warmed soils (Figure 6) leading to the subsequent positive direct effect on R eco (Figure 7). This effect coincided with an increase in the intensities of stress response genes (Figure S7), suggesting a potential trade-off between stress tolerance versus resource acquisition as described by Malik et al. (2020). In support of this explanation, the abundance of functional genes involved in both labile and recalcitrant carbon cycling was significantly elevated by experimental increases in precipitation (Li et al., 2017). The larger reduction of carbon decomposition genes in the winter warming treatment (Figure 6) indicated that winter warming also inhibited the production of carbon decomposition enzymes through a decrease of soil fungal abundance and altered fungal community (Table S3).Physiological stress and constraints on enzyme production due to reduced water availability (Tiemann &amp; Billings, 2011) are likely to have contributed strongly to the decrease of carbon decomposition genes in warmed soils (Figure 6) leading to the subsequent positive direct effect on R eco (Figure 7).

        <p>Decreases in genes for labile and recalcitrant carbon decomposition in response to soil drying caused by winter warming could indicate a negative feedback mechanism that reduces SOC losses. Warming also decreased the relative abundance of carbon decomposition genes in transplanted intact soil monoliths moved between sites at different altitudes in Tibet (Yue et al., 2015). The opposite was observed in irrigated arid soils where, for example, Li et al. (2017) determined an increase in the abundance of functional genes involved in both labile and recalcitrant carbon cycling after warming. This also contrasts with results from temperate prairies, where microbial genes for complex organic compound degradation were increased by warming (Feng et al., 2017). Our study therefore provides further evidence that changes in the water cycle caused by climate change have the potential to moderate warming-induced carbon losses and could even reverse the expected trend on the Tibetan Plateau. This implies a more prominent role for soil moisture in regulating SOC processing in the future than it has played in the past by enhancing the feedback between soil warming and global climate change (Werner et al., 2020).Decreases in genes for labile and recalcitrant carbon decomposition in response to soil drying caused by winter warming could indicate a negative feedback mechanism that reduces SOC losses.

        <p>Soil organic carbon associated with minerals is considered as one of the most fundamental long-term, stable carbon pools (Cotrufo et al., 2015;Six &amp; Paustian, 2014). The mM fraction is suggested as a robust indicator for management-induced SOC changes over decadal time scales (Six &amp; Paustian, 2014). In this study, as with bulk SOC, there was no difference between warming treatments in coarse gates (Table 1). However, macroaggregate turnover rates (based on the ratio of fine iPOM to coarse iPOM within macroaggregates; Six et al., 2000) were up to 1.6 times less in the winter warming treatments compared to the control. So, in contrast to year-round warming which decreased soil aggregate stability, winter warming had slower macroaggregate turnover and increased carbon contents in smaller aggregate size fractions, indicating increased carbon stabilization via organo-mineral interactions and microaggregation (Table 1).Soil organic carbon associated with minerals is considered as one of the most fundamental long-term, stable carbon pools (Cotrufo et al., 2015;Six &amp; Paustian, 2014).

        <p>The enmeshing action of fungal mycelia in the formation of soil aggregates is widely recognized (Lehmann et al., 2017;Rillig &amp; Mummey, 2006). Rillig et al. (2002) reported that warming of an annual grassland in the United States decreased the water stability of soil aggregate and abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) hyphae (Glomus sp.). In this study, AMF were not measured directly, but a reduction in phylum Glomeromycotina abundance was determined under year-round warming (Figure S6) indicating a mechanism for the reduction in macroaggregate stability under this treatment. The changes in the AMF fungi response to warming and their relationship to the soil aggregation represent a key focus for further study.The enmeshing action of fungal mycelia in the formation of soil aggregates is widely recognized (Lehmann et al., 2017;Rillig &amp; Mummey, 2006).

        <p>Microbial residue ("necromass") is an important constituent of stable SOC due to its tendency for sorption to mineral surfaces or protection within stable aggregates (Kuzyakov &amp; Mason-Jones, 2018;Liang et al., 2017;Miltner et al., 2012), described as the "entombing effect" by Liang et al. (2017). Soil water content was up to ~5% less in the warmed treatments in this study (Figure S4). Soil drying can promote the formation of new and/or stronger organomineral interactions with microbial by-products (e.g., amino sugars; Bai et al., 2020;Kaiser et al., 2015). The importance of the contribution of microbial necromass to stable SOC pools has recently been reassessed (Liang et al., 2019). This was confirmed in our study where up to half of total SOC was derived from amino sugars, and ~60% were of fungal origin (Figure 5). Fungi tend to be more resistant to drought, while bacteria are more resilient (de Vries et al., 2012) and can return close to control conditions upon rewetting (Canarini et al., 2017). In our study, soils under winter warming contained more of the mM and mM-silt+clay fraction than year-round warmed soils. Bacterial residue carbon content was positively related to the carbon content of the mM and mM-silt+clay fractions (Figure 5) revealing the enhanced physical preservation of SOC under winter warming.Microbial residue ("necromass") is an important constituent of stable SOC due to its tendency for sorption to mineral surfaces or protection within stable aggregates (Kuzyakov &amp; Mason-Jones, 2018;Liang et al., 2017;Miltner et al., 2012), described as the "entombing effect" by Liang et al.

        <p>Soil organic carbon dynamics associated with specific organic compounds can be sensitive indicators of effects of warming because the temperature sensitivity of recalcitrant organic matter increases with warming over time as the labile pool is depleted more rapidly by increasing enzyme activity (Hartley &amp; Ineson, 2008). Like Jia et al. ( 2019), we determined a decrease in plant-derived phenols from lignin and suberin (identified herein as the phenol-C functional group by 13 C NMR) in topsoils after 5 years of continuous warming experiment (YW treatment). A reduction in lignin content of plant inputs was previously identified in warmed temperate grasslands suggesting a potential mechanism (Henry et al., 2005;Sanaullah et al., 2014). An increased abundance of carboxyl-C was unique to winter-warmed soils (Figure 1). Although carboxylic (fatty) acids are susceptible to rapid oxidation by soil microorganisms, they have the potential for sequestration within the soil by complexing with clay minerals and other forms of organic matter (Bull et al., 2000) suggesting a route to enhanced physical protection (Figure 5; Table 1) of plant and microbial derived carbon. The analysis of lipid biomarkers has the potential to assign source of the carboxyl-C in future analysis of warmed soils to complement the analysis of amino sugars as indicators of soil microbial contributions to SOC.Soil organic carbon dynamics associated with specific organic compounds can be sensitive indicators of effects of warming because the temperature sensitivity of recalcitrant organic matter increases with warming over time as the labile pool is depleted more rapidly by increasing enzyme activity (Hartley &amp; Ineson, 2008).

        <p>Inorganic nitrogen content was significantly less under year-round warming (Figure 1c) indicating nitrogen limitation due to climate change in Tibetan alpine meadow ecosystems previously recognized by Ding et al. (2019) that may be exacerbated by drought stress. A recent large-scale field investigation along a 1000-km transect in the Tibetan Plateau revealed that gross rates of N mineralization were positively associated with soil moisture (Mao et al., 2020). Microbial residues are comparatively rich in nitrogen (Cotrufo et al., 2015) and fungal residues (derived from chitin) are considered to be more persistent than bacterial residues (derived from peptidoglycan; Ding et al., 2019;Six et al., 2006) making the latter more susceptible to nitrogen mining during the growing with clay-sized particles where physicochemical interactions may limit the accessibility of N-containing compounds (Jilling et al., 2018). From an alternative perspective, the greater aggregate turnover under year-round warming may result in potential destabilization of bacterial residues from clay-silt fractions (Table 1;Inorganic nitrogen content was significantly less under year-round warming (Figure 1c) indicating nitrogen limitation due to climate change in Tibetan alpine meadow ecosystems previously recognized by Ding et al.
