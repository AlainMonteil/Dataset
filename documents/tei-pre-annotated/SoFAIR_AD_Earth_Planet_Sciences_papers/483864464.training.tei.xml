        <p>Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize datasets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO 2 emissions (E FOS ) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (E LUC ), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO 2 concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (G ATM ) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO 2 sink (S OCEAN ) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based data products. The terrestrial CO 2 sink (S LAND ) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. The resulting carbon budget imbalance (B IM ), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ . For the first time, an approach is shown to reconcile the difference in our E LUC estimate with the one from national greenhouse gas inventories, supporting the assessment of collective countries' climate progress.Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change.

        <p>For the year 2020, E FOS declined by 5.4 % relative to 2019, with fossil emissions at 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr -1 (9.3 ± 0.5 GtC yr -1 when the cement carbonation sink is included), and E LUC was 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC yr -1 , for a total anthropogenic CO 2 emission of 10.2 ± 0.8 GtC yr -1 (37.4 ± 2.9 GtCO 2 ). Also, for 2020, G ATM was 5.0 ± 0.2 GtC yr -1 (2.4 ± 0.1 ppm yr -1 ), S OCEAN was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC yr -1 , and S LAND was 2.9 ± 1 GtC yr -1 , with a B IM of -0.8 GtC yr -1 .

        <p>Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959-2020, but discrepancies of up to 1 GtC yr -1 persist for the representation of annual to semidecadal variability in CO 2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO 2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the strength of the ocean sink over the last decade.

        <p>Global fossil CO 2 emissions (excluding cement carbonation) in 2021 are returning towards their 2019 levels after decreasing 5.4 % in 2020. The 2020 decrease was 0.52 GtC yr -1 (1.9 GtCO 2 yr -1 ), bringing 2020 emissions to 9.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr -1 (34.8 ± 1.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 ), comparable to the emissions level of 2012. Preliminary estimates based on data available in March 2022 suggest fossil CO 2 emissions rebounded 4.8 % in 2021 (4.2 % to 5.4 %), bringing emissions to 9.9 GtC yr -1 (36.4 GtCO 2 yr -1 ), back to about the same level as in 2019 (10.0 ± 0.5 GtC yr -1 , 36.7 ± 1.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 ). Emissions from coal and gas in 2021 are expected to have rebounded above 2019 levels, while emissions from oil were still below their 2019 level. Emissions are expected to have been 5.7 % higher in 2021 than in 2019 in China, reaching 3.0 GtC (11.1 GtCO 2 ), and also higher in India with a 3.2 % increase in 2021 relative to 2019, reaching 0.74 GtC (2.7 GtCO 2 ). In contrast, projected 2021 emissions in the United States (1.4 GtC, 5.0 GtCO 2 ), European Union (0.8 GtC, 2.8 GtCO 2 ), and the rest of the world (4.0 GtC, 14.8 GtCO 2 , in aggregate) remained respectively 4.5 %, 5.3 %, and 4.0 % below their 2019 levels. These changes in 2021 emissions reflect the stringency of the COVID-19 confinement levels in 2020 and the pre-covid background trends in emissions in these countries.Global fossil CO 2 emissions (excluding cement carbonation) in 2021 are returning towards their 2019 levels after decreasing 5.4 % in 2020.

        <p>Fossil CO 2 emissions significantly decreased in 23 countries during the decade 2010-2019. Altogether, these 23 countries contribute to about 2.5 GtC yr -1 fossil fuel CO 2 emissions over the last decade, only about one-quarter of world CO 2 fossil emissions.Fossil CO 2 emissions significantly decreased in 23 countries during the decade 2010-2019.

        <p>Global CO 2 emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LUC) converge based on revised data of land-use change and show a small decrease over the past two decades. Near-constant gross emissions estimated at 3.8 ± 0.6 GtC yr -1 in the 2011-2020 decade are only partly offset by growing carbon removals on managed land of 2.7 ± 0.4 GtC yr -1 , resulting in the net emissions in managed land of 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC yr -1 (4.1 ± 2.6 GtCO 2 yr -1 ). These net emissions decreased by 0.2 GtC in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, with large uncertainty. Preliminary estimates for emissions in 2021 suggest a 0.1 GtC decrease for 2021, giving net emissions of 0.8 GtC yr -1 (2.9 GtCO 2 yr -1 ). The small decrease in net LUC emissions amidst large uncertainty prohibits robust conclusions concerning trend changes of total anthropogenic emissions. For the first time, we link the global carbon budget models' estimates to the official country reporting of national greenhouse gases inventories. While the global carbon budget distinguishes anthropogenic from natural drivers of land carbon fluxes, country reporting is area-based and attributes part of the natural terrestrial sink on managed land to the land-use sector. Accounting for this redistribution, the two approaches are shown to be consistent with each other.Global CO 2 emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry (LUC) converge based on revised data of land-use change and show a small decrease over the past two decades.

        <p>The remaining carbon budget for a 50 % likelihood to limit global warming to 1.5, 1.7, and 2 • C has respectively reduced to 120 GtC (420 GtCO 2 ), 210 GtC (770 GtCO 2 ) and 350 GtC (1270 GtCO 2 ) from the beginning of 2022, equivalent to 11, 20, and 32 years, assuming 2021 emissions levels. Total anthropogenic emissions were 10.4 GtC yr -1 (38.0 GtCO 2 yr -1 ) in 2020, with a preliminary estimate of 10.7 GtC yr -1 (39.3 GtCO 2 yr -1 ) for 2021. The remaining carbon budget to keep global temperatures below these climate targets has shrunk by 21 GtC (77 GtCO 2 ) since the release of the IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 assessment. Reaching zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 entails cutting total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions by about 0.4 GtC (1.4 GtCO 2 ) each year on average, comparable to the decrease during 2020, highlighting the scale of the action needed.The remaining carbon budget for a 50 % likelihood to limit global warming to 1.5, 1.7, and 2 • C has respectively reduced to 120 GtC (420 GtCO 2 ), 210 GtC (770 GtCO 2 ) and 350 GtC (1270 GtCO 2 ) from the beginning of 2022, equivalent to 11, 20, and 32 years, assuming 2021 emissions levels.

        <p>The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 277 parts per million (ppm) in 1750 (Joos and Spahni, 2008), the beginning of the industrial era, to 412.4 ± 0.1 ppm in 2020 (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022; Fig. 1). The atmospheric CO 2 increase above pre-industrial levels was, initially, primarily caused by the release of carbon to the atmosphere from deforestation and other land-use change activities (Canadell et al., 2022).

To account for the difference of mean CO 2 and seasonality between the NOAA/ESRL and the Scripps station networks used here, the Scripps surface average (from two stations) was de-seasonalized and adjusted to match the NOAA/ESRL surface average (from multiple stations) by adding the mean difference of 0.667 ppm, calculated here from overlapping data during 1980-2012. thropogenic emissions to the atmosphere from around 1950 and their relative share has continued to increase until the present.

        <p>The global carbon budget (GCB) presented here refers to the mean, variations, and trends in the perturbation of CO 2 in the environment, referenced to the beginning of the Industrial Era (defined here as 1750). This paper describes the components of the global carbon cycle over the historical period with a stronger focus on the recent period (since 1958, onset of atmospheric CO 2 measurements), the last decade (2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020), the last year (2020), and the current year (2021). We quantify the input of CO 2 to the atmosphere by emissions from human activities, the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and the resulting changes in the storage of carbon in the land and ocean reservoirs in response to increasing atmospheric CO 2 levels, climate change and variability, and other anthropogenic and natural changes (Fig. 2). An understanding of this perturbation budget over time and the underlying variability and trends of the natural carbon cycle is necessary to understand the response of natural sinks to changes in climate, CO 2 , and land-use change drivers, and to quan-tify emissions compatible with a given climate stabilization target.The global carbon budget (GCB) presented here refers to the mean, variations, and trends in the perturbation of CO 2 in the environment, referenced to the beginning of the Industrial Era (defined here as 1750).

        <p>The components of the CO 2 budget that are reported annually in this paper include separate and independent estimates for the CO 2 emissions from (1) fossil fuel combustion and oxidation from all energy and industrial processes, also including cement production and carbonation (E FOS ; GtC yr -1 ); (2) the emissions resulting from deliberate human activities on land, including those leading to land-use change (E LUC ; GtC yr -1 ); and their partitioning among (3) the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 concentration (G ATM ; GtC yr -1 ), and the uptake of CO 2 (the "CO 2 sinks") in (4) the ocean (S OCEAN ; GtC yr -1 ) and ( 5) on land (S LAND ; GtC yr -1 ). The CO 2 sinks as defined here conceptually include the response of the land (including inland waters and estuaries) and ocean (including coasts and territorial seas) to elevated CO 2 and changes in climate and other environmental conditions, although in practice not all processes are fully accounted for (see Sect. 2.7). Global emissions and their partitioning among the atmosphere, ocean, and land are in reality in balance. Due to the combination of imperfect spatial and/or temporal data coverage, errors in each estimate, and smaller terms not included in our budget estimate (discussed in Sect. 2.7), the independent estimates (1) to (5) above do not necessarily add up to zero. We therefore (a) additionally assess a set of global atmospheric inverse model results that by design close the global carbon balance (see Sect. 2.6), and (b) estimate a budget imbalance (B IM ), which is a measure of the mismatch between the estimated emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, land, and ocean, as follows:The components of the CO 2 budget that are reported annually in this paper include separate and independent estimates for the CO 2 emissions from (1) fossil fuel combustion and oxidation from all energy and industrial processes, also including cement production and carbonation (E FOS ; GtC yr -1 ); (2) the emissions resulting from deliberate human activities on land, including those leading to land-use change (E LUC ; GtC yr -1 ); and their partitioning among (3) the growth rate of atmospheric CO 2 concentration (G ATM ; GtC yr -1 ), and the uptake of CO 2 (the "CO 2 sinks") in (4) the ocean (S OCEAN ; GtC yr -1 ) and ( 5) on land (S LAND ; GtC yr -1 ).

        <p>The global CO 2 budget has been assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in all assessment reports (Prentice et al., 2001;Schimel et al., 1995;Watson et al., 1990;Denman et al., 2007;Ciais et al., 2013;Canadell et al., 2022), and by others (e.g. Ballantyne et al., 2012). The Global Carbon Project (GCP, https://www. globalcarbonproject.org, last access: 11 March 2022) has coordinated this cooperative community effort for the annual publication of global carbon budgets for the year 2005 (Raupach et al., 2007; including fossil emissions only), year 2006 2022) for all numbers, except for the carbon stocks in coasts which is from a literature review of coastal marine sediments (Price and Warren, 2016).

This choice reflects the difficulty of characterizing the uncertainty in the CO 2 fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean and land reservoirs individually, particularly on an annual basis, as well as the difficulty of updating the CO 2 emissions from land-use change. A likelihood of 68 % provides an indication of our current capability to quantify each term and its uncertainty given the available information. The uncertainties reported here combine statistical analysis of the underlying data, assessments of uncertainties in the generation of the datasets, and expert judgement of the likelihood of results lying outside this range.

        <p>This paper provides a detailed description of the datasets and methodology used to compute the global carbon budget estimates for the industrial period, from 1750 to 2020, and in more detail for the period since 1959. It also provides decadal averages starting in 1960 including the most recent decade (2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020), results for the year 2020, and a projection for the year 2021. Finally, it provides cumulative emissions from fossil fuels and land-use change since the year 1750, the pre-industrial period; and since the year 1850, the reference year for historical simulations in IPCC AR6 (Eyring et al., 2016). This paper is updated every year using the format of "living data" to keep a record of budget versions and the changes in new data, revision of data, and changes in methodology that lead to changes in estimates of the carbon budget. Additional materials associated with the release of each new version will be posted at the Global Carbon Project (GCP) website (http://www.globalcarbonproject. org/carbonbudget, last access: 11 March 2022), with fossil fuel emissions also available through the Global Carbon Atlas (http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org, last access: 11 March 2022).

        <p>Multiple organizations and research groups around the world generated the original measurements and data used to complete the global carbon budget. The effort presented here is thus mainly one of synthesis, where results from individual groups are collated, analysed, and evaluated for consistency. We facilitate access to original data with the understanding that primary datasets will be referenced in future work (see Table 2 for how to cite the datasets). Descriptions of the measurements, models, and methodologies follow below, and detailed descriptions of each component are provided elsewhere. This is the 16th version of the global carbon budget and the 10th revised version in the format of a living data update in Earth System Science Data. It builds on the latest published global carbon budget of Friedlingstein et al. (2020). The main changes are as follows: the inclusion of (1) data to year 2020 and a projection for the global carbon budget for year 2021, (2) a Kaya analysis to identify the driving factors behind the recent trends in fossil fuel emissions (changes in population, GDP per person, energy use per GDP, and CO 2 emissions per unit energy), (3) an estimate of the ocean sink from models and data products combined, (4) an assessment of the relative contributions of increased atmospheric CO 2 and climate change in driving the land and ocean sinks, and (5) an assessment of the current trends in anthropogenic emissions and implications for the remaining carbon budget for specific climate targets. The main methodological differences between recent annual carbon budgets (2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020) are summarized in Table 3 and previous changes since 2006 are provided in Table A7.Multiple organizations and research groups around the world generated the original measurements and data used to complete the global carbon budget.

        <p>The estimates of global and national fossil CO 2 emissions (E FOS ) include the oxidation of fossil fuels through both combustion (e.g. transport, heating) and chemical oxidation (e.g. carbon anode decomposition in aluminium refining) activities, and the decomposition of carbonates in industrial processes (e.g. the production of cement). We also include CO 2 uptake from the cement carbonation process. Several emissions sources are not estimated or not fully covered: coverage of emissions from lime production are not global, and decomposition of carbonates in glass and ceramic production are included only for the "Annex 1" countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) due to a lack of activity data. These omissions are considered to be minor. Short-cycle carbon emissionsfor example from combustion of biomass -are not included here but are accounted for in the CO 2 emissions from land use (see Sect. 2.2).The estimates of global and national fossil CO 2 emissions (E FOS ) include the oxidation of fossil fuels through both combustion (e.g. transport, heating) and chemical oxidation (e.g. carbon anode decomposition in aluminium refining) activities, and the decomposition of carbonates in industrial processes (e.g. the production of cement).

        <p>Our estimates of fossil CO 2 emissions are derived using the standard approach of activity data and emission factors, relying on data collection by many other parties. Our goal is to produce the best estimate of this flux, and we therefore use a prioritization framework to combine data from different sources that have used different methods, while being careful to avoid double counting and undercounting of emissions sources. The CDIAC-FF emissions dataset, derived largely from UN energy data, forms the foundation, and we extend emissions to year Y-1 using energy growth rates reported by BP. We then proceed to replace estimates using data from what we consider to be superior sources, for example Annex 1 countries' official submissions to the UNFCCC. All data points are potentially subject to revision, not just the latest year. For full details see Andrew and Peters (2021).Our estimates of fossil CO 2 emissions are derived using the standard approach of activity data and emission factors, relying on data collection by many other parties.

        <p>Other estimates of global fossil CO 2 emissions exist, and these are compared by Andrew (2020a). The most common reason for differences in estimates of global fossil CO 2 emissions is a difference in which emissions sources are included in the datasets. Datasets such as those published by BP energy company, the US Energy Information Administration, and the International Energy Agency's "CO 2 emissions from fuel combustion" are all generally limited to emissions from combustion of fossil fuels. In contrast, datasets such as PRIMAP-hist, CEDS, EDGAR, and GCP's dataset aim to include all sources of fossil CO 2 emissions. See Andrew (2020a) for detailed comparisons and discussion.Other estimates of global fossil CO 2 emissions exist, and these are compared by Andrew (2020a).

        <p>Cement absorbs CO 2 from the atmosphere over its lifetime, a process known as "cement carbonation". We estimate this CO 2 sink as the average of two studies in the literature (Cao et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2021). Both studies use the same model, developed by Xi et al. (2016), with different parameterizations and input data. Since carbonation is a function of both current and previous cement production, we extend these estimates by 1 year to 2020 by using the growth rate derived from the smoothed cement emissions (10-year smoothing) fitted to the carbonation data.Cement absorbs CO 2 from the atmosphere over its lifetime, a process known as "cement carbonation".

        <p>We use the Kaya identity for a simple decomposition of CO 2 emissions into the key drivers (Raupach et al., 2007). While there are variations (Peters et al., 2017), we focus here on a decomposition of CO 2 emissions into population, GDP per person, energy use per GDP, and CO 2 emissions per energy use. Multiplying these individual components together returns the CO 2 emissions. Using the decomposition, it is possible to attribute the change in CO 2 emissions to the change in each of the drivers. This method gives a first-order understanding of what causes CO 2 emissions to change each year.We use the Kaya identity for a simple decomposition of CO 2 emissions into the key drivers (Raupach et al., 2007).

        <p>We provide a projection of global CO 2 emissions in 2021 by combining separate projections for China, the USA, the EU, India, and for all other countries combined. The methods are different for each of these. For China we combine monthly fossil fuel production data from the National Bureau of Statistics, import and export data from the Customs Administration, and monthly coal consumption estimates from SX Coal (2021), giving us partial data for the growth rates to date of natural gas, petroleum, and cement, and of the consumption itself for raw coal. We then use a regression model to project full-year emissions based on historical observations. For the USA our projection is taken directly from the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Short-Term Energy Outlook (EIA, 2022), combined with the year-todate growth rate of cement production. For the EU we use monthly energy data from Eurostat to derive estimates of monthly CO 2 emissions through July, with coal emissions extended first through September using a statistical relationship with reported electricity generation from coal and other factors, then through December assuming normal seasonal patterns. EU emissions from natural gas -a strongly seasonal cycle -are extended through December using bias-adjusted Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (Chatfield, 1978). EU emissions from oil are derived using the EIA's projection of oil consumption for Europe. EU cement emissions are based on available year-to-date data from two of the largest producers, Germany and Poland. India's projected emissions are derived from estimates through August (September for coal) using the methods of Andrew (2020b) and extrapolated assuming normal seasonal patterns. Emissions for the rest of the world are derived using projected growth in economic production from the IMF (2022) combined with extrapolated changes in emissions intensity of economic production. More details on the E FOS methodology and its 2021 projection can be found in Appendix C1. The net CO 2 flux from land use, land-use change, and forestry (E LUC , called land-use change emissions in the rest of the text) includes CO 2 fluxes from deforestation, afforestation, logging and forest degradation (including harvest activity), shifting cultivation (cycle of cutting forest for agriculture, then abandoning), and regrowth of forests following wood harvest or abandonment of agriculture. Emissions from peat burning and drainage are added from external datasets. Three bookkeeping approaches (updated estimates of BLUE (Hansis et al., 2015), OSCAR (Gasser et al., 2020), and H&amp;N2017 (Houghton and Nassikas, 2017)) were used to quantify gross sources and sinks and the resulting net E LUC . Uncertainty estimates were derived from the dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) ensemble for the time period prior to 1960, using for the recent decades an uncertainty range of ±0.7 GtC yr -1 , which is a semi-quantitative measure for annual and decadal emissions and reflects our best value judgement that there is at least 68 % chance (±1σ ) that the true land-use change emission lies within the given range, for the range of processes considered here. This uncertainty range had been increased from 0.5 GtC yr -1 after new bookkeeping models were included that indicated a larger spread P.

        <p>Our E LUC estimates follow the definition of global carbon cycle models of CO 2 fluxes related to land use and land management and differ from IPCC definitions adopted in national GHG inventories (NGHGIs) for reporting under the UN-FCCC, which additionally generally include, through adoption of the IPCC so-called managed land proxy approach, the terrestrial fluxes occurring on land defined by countries as managed. This partly includes fluxes due to environmental change (e.g. atmospheric CO 2 increase), which are part of S LAND in our definition. This causes the global emission estimates to be smaller for NGHGIs than for the global carbon budget definition (Grassi et al., 2018). The same is the case for the Food Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates of carbon fluxes on forest land, which include, compared to S LAND , both anthropogenic and natural sources on managed land (Tubiello et al., 2021). Using the approach outlined in Grassi et al. (2021), here we map as additional information the two definitions to each other, to provide a comparison of the anthropogenic carbon budget to the official country reporting to the climate convention.

        <p>The rate of growth of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration is provided for years 1959-2020 by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL; Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022), which is updated from Ballantyne et al. (2012) and includes recent revisions to the calibration scale of atmospheric CO 2 measurements (Hall et al., 2021). For the 1959-1979 period, the global growth rate is based on measurements of atmospheric CO 2 concentration averaged from the Mauna Loa and South Pole stations, as observed by the CO 2 Program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (Keeling et al., 1976). For the 1980-2020 time period, the global growth rate is based on the average of multiple stations selected from the marine boundary layer sites with well-mixed background air (Ballantyne et al., 2012), after fitting each station with a smoothed curve as a function of time, and averaging by latitude band (Masarie and Tans, 1995). The annual growth rate is estimated by Dlugokencky and Tans (2022) from atmospheric CO 2 concentration by taking the average of the most recent December-January months corrected for the average seasonal cycle and subtracting this same average 1 year earlier. The growth rate in units of ppm yr -1 is converted to units of GtC yr -1 by multiplying by a factor of 2.124 GtC ppm -1 , assuming instantaneous mixing of CO 2 throughout the atmosphere (Ballantyne et al., 2012).The rate of growth of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration is provided for years 1959-2020 by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL; Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022), which is updated from Ballantyne et al.

For the 1980-2020 time period, the global growth rate is based on the average of multiple stations selected from the marine boundary layer sites with well-mixed background air (Ballantyne et al., 2012), after fitting each station with a smoothed curve as a function of time, and averaging by latitude band (Masarie and Tans, 1995). The annual growth rate is estimated by Dlugokencky and Tans (2022) from atmospheric CO 2 concentration by taking the average of the most recent December-January months corrected for the average seasonal cycle and subtracting this same average 1 year earlier. The growth rate in units of ppm yr -1 is converted to units of GtC yr -1 by multiplying by a factor of 2.124 GtC ppm -1 , assuming instantaneous mixing of CO 2 throughout the atmosphere (Ballantyne et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Starting in 2020, NOAA/ESRL now provides estimates of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations with respect to a new calibration scale, referred to as WMO-CO 2 -X2019, in line with the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) community (Hall et al., 2021). The WMO-CO 2 -X2019 scale improves upon the earlier WMO-CO 2 -X2007 scale by including a broader set of standards, which contain CO 2 in a wider range of concentrations that span the range 250-800 ppm (versus 250-520 ppm for WMO-CO 2 -X2007). In addition, NOAA/ESRL made two minor corrections to the analytical procedure used to quantify CO 2 concentrations, fixing an error in the second virial coefficient of CO 2 and accounting for loss of a small amount of CO 2 to materials in the manometer during the measurement process. The difference in concentrations measured using WMO-CO 2 -X2019 versus WMO-CO 2 -X2007 is ∼ +0.18 ppm at 400 ppm and the observational record of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations have been revised accordingly. The revisions have been applied retrospectively in all cases where the calibrations were performed by NOAA/ESRL, thus affecting measurements made by members of the WMO-GAW programme and other regionally coordinated programmes (e.g. Integrated Carbon Observing System, ICOS). Changes to the CO 2 concentrations measured across these networks propagate to the global mean CO 2 concentrations. Comparing the estimates of G ATM made by Dlugokencky and Tans (2020), used in the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), with updated estimates from Dlugokencky and Tans (2022), used here, we find that G ATM reduced on average by -0.06 GtC yr -1 during 2010-2019 and by -0.01 GtC yr -1 during 1959-2019 due to the new calibration. These changes are well within the uncertainty ranges reported below. Hence the change in analytical procedures made by NOAA/ESRL has a negligible impact on the atmospheric growth rate G ATM .Starting in 2020, NOAA/ESRL now provides estimates of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations with respect to a new calibration scale, referred to as WMO-CO 2 -X2019, in line with the recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) community (Hall et al., 2021).

        <p>The uncertainty around the atmospheric growth rate is due to four main factors. First, the long-term reproducibility of reference gas standards (around 0.03 ppm for 1σ from the 1980s; Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022). Second, small unexplained systematic analytical errors that may have a duration of several months to 2 years come and go. They have been simulated by randomizing both the duration and the magnitude (determined from the existing evidence) in a Monte Carlo procedure. Third, the network composition of the marine boundary layer with some sites coming or going, gaps in the time series at each site, etc. (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022). The latter uncertainty was estimated by NOAA/ESRL with a Monte Carlo method by constructing 100 "alternative" networks (Masarie and Tans, 1995;NOAA/ESRL, 2019). The second and third uncertainties, summed in quadrature, add up to 0.085 ppm on average (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022). Fourth, the uncertainty associated with using the average CO 2 concentration from a sur-face network to approximate the true atmospheric average CO 2 concentration (mass-weighted, in three dimensions) as needed to assess the total atmospheric CO 2 burden. In reality, CO 2 variations measured at the stations will not exactly track changes in total atmospheric burden, with offsets in magnitude and phasing due to vertical and horizontal mixing. This effect must be very small on decadal and longer timescales, when the atmosphere can be considered well mixed. Preliminary estimates suggest this effect would increase the annual uncertainty, but a full analysis is not yet available. We therefore maintain an uncertainty around the annual growth rate based on the multiple stations' dataset ranges between 0.11 and 0.72 GtC yr -1 , with a mean of 0.61 GtC yr -1 for 1959-1979 and 0.17 GtC yr -1 for 1980-2020, when a larger set of stations were available as provided by Dlugokencky and Tans (2022), but recognize further exploration of this uncertainty is required. At this time, we estimate the uncertainty of the decadal averaged growth rate after 1980 at 0.02 GtC yr -1 based on the calibration and the annual growth rate uncertainty but stretched over a 10-year interval. For years prior to 1980, we estimate the decadal averaged uncertainty to be 0.07 GtC yr -1 based on a factor proportional to the annual uncertainty prior and after 1980 (0.02 × [0.61/0.17] GtC yr -1 ).The uncertainty around the atmospheric growth rate is due to four main factors.

        <p>To estimate the total carbon accumulated in the atmosphere since 1750 or 1850, we use an atmospheric CO 2 concentration of 277 ± 3 ppm or 286 ± 3 ppm, respectively, based on a cubic spline fit to ice core data (Joos and Spahni, 2008). For the construction of the cumulative budget shown in Fig. 3, we use the fitted estimates of CO 2 concentration from Joos and Spahni (2008) to estimate the annual atmospheric growth rate using the conversion factors shown in Table 1. The uncertainty of ±3 ppm (converted to ±1σ ) is taken directly from the IPCC's AR5 assessment (Ciais et al., 2013). Typical uncertainties in the growth rate in atmospheric CO 2 concentration from ice core data are equivalent to ±0.1-0.15 GtC yr -1 as evaluated from the Law Dome data (Etheridge et al., 1996) for individual 20-year intervals over the period from 1850 to 1960 (Bruno and Joos, 1997).To estimate the total carbon accumulated in the atmosphere since 1750 or 1850, we use an atmospheric CO 2 concentration of 277 ± 3 ppm or 286 ± 3 ppm, respectively, based on a cubic spline fit to ice core data (Joos and Spahni, 2008).

Additional analysis suggests that the first half of the year (the boreal winter-spring-summer transition) shows more interannual variability than the second half of the year (the boreal summer-autumn-winter transition), so that the exact projection method applied to the second half of the year has a relatively smaller impact on the projection of the full year. Uncertainty is estimated from past variability using the standard deviation of the last 5 years' monthly growth rates.We provide an assessment of G ATM for 2021 based on the monthly calculated global atmospheric CO 2 concentration (GLO) through August (Dlugokencky and Tans, 2022), and bias-adjusted Holt-Winters exponential smoothing with additive seasonality (Chatfield, 1978) to project to January 2022.

        <p>The reported estimate of the global ocean anthropogenic CO 2 sink S OCEAN is derived as the average of two estimates. The first estimate is derived as the mean over an ensemble of eight global ocean biogeochemistry models (GOBMs, Tables 4 and A2). The second estimate is obtained as the mean over an ensemble of seven observation-based data products (Tables 4 andA3). An eighth product (Watson et al., 2020) is shown but is not included in the ensemble average as it differs from the other products by adjusting the flux to a cool, salty ocean surface skin (see Appendix C3.1 for a discussion of the Watson product). The GOBMs simulate both the natural and anthropogenic CO 2 cycles in the ocean. They constrain the anthropogenic air-sea CO 2 flux (the dominant component of S OCEAN ) by the transport of carbon into the ocean interior, which is also the controlling factor of present-day ocean carbon uptake in the real world. They cover the full globe and all seasons and were recently evaluated against surface ocean carbon observations, suggesting they are suitable to estimate the annual ocean carbon sink (Hauck et al., 2020). The data products are tightly linked to observations of f CO 2 (fugacity of CO 2 , which equals pCO 2 corrected for the non-ideal behaviour of the gas; Pfeil et al., 2013), which carry imprints of temporal and spatial variability but are also sensitive to uncertainties in gas-exchange parameterizations and data sparsity. Their asset is the assessment of interannual and spatial variability (Hauck et al., 2020).

        <p>The global f CO 2 -based flux estimates were adjusted to remove the pre-industrial ocean source of CO 2 to the atmosphere of 0.61 GtC yr -1 from river input to the ocean (the average of 0.45 ± 0.18 GtC yr -1 by Jacobson et al., 2007, and 0.78 ± 0.41 GtC yr -1 by Resplandy et al., 2018), to satisfy our definition of S OCEAN (Hauck et al., 2020).

        <p>a variable number of hidden neurons (varying between 2-5), and 20 % of the randomly selected training data were withheld for independent internal testing. Based on the best output performance (tested using the 20 % withheld input data), the best performing number of neurons was selected. In a second step, we trained the network 10 times using the best number of neurons identified in step 1 and different sets of randomly selected training data. The mean of the 10 training runs is considered our best forecast, whereas the standard deviation of the 10 ensembles provides a first-order estimate of the forecast uncertainty. This uncertainty is then combined with the S OCEAN uncertainty (0.4 GtC yr -1 ) to estimate the overall uncertainty of the 2021 prediction.a variable number of hidden neurons (varying between 2-5), and 20 % of the randomly selected training data were withheld for independent internal testing.

        <p>The terrestrial land sink (S LAND ) is thought to be due to the combined effects of fertilization by rising atmospheric CO 2 and N inputs on plant growth, as well as the effects of climate change such as the lengthening of the growing season in northern temperate and boreal areas. S LAND does not include land sinks directly resulting from land use and landuse change (e.g. regrowth of vegetation) as these are part of the land-use flux (E LUC ), although system boundaries make it difficult to exactly attribute CO 2 fluxes on land between S LAND and E LUC (Erb et al., 2013). S LAND is estimated from the multi-model mean of 17 DGVMs (Table A1). As described in Appendix C4, DGVM simulations include all climate variability and CO 2 effects over land, with 12 DGVMs also including the effect of N inputs. The DGVM estimate of S LAND does not include the export of carbon to aquatic systems or its historical perturbation, which is discussed in Appendix D3. See Appendix C4 for DGVM evaluation and uncertainty assessment for S LAND , using the International Land Model Benchmarking system (ILAMB; Collier et al., 2018). More details on the S LAND methodology can be found in Appendix C4.The terrestrial land sink (S LAND ) is thought to be due to the combined effects of fertilization by rising atmospheric CO 2 and N inputs on plant growth, as well as the effects of climate change such as the lengthening of the growing season in northern temperate and boreal areas.

        <p>Like the ocean forecast, the land CO 2 sink (S LAND ) forecast is based on the annual historical and estimated 2021 atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Dlugokencky and Tans 2021), historical and estimated 2021 annual global fossil fuel emissions from this year's carbon budget, and the summer (June, July, August) ONI (NCEP, 2021). All training data are again used to best match S LAND from 1959 through 2020 from this year's carbon budget using a feed-forward neural network. To avoid overfitting, the neural network was trained with a variable number of hidden neurons (varying between 2-15), larger than for S OCEAN prediction due to the stronger land carbon interannual variability. As done for S OCEAN , a pretraining step selects the optimal number of hidden neurons based on 20 % withheld input data, and in a second step, an ensemble of 10 forecasts is produced to provide the mean forecast plus uncertainty. This uncertainty is then combined with the S LAND uncertainty for 2020 (1.0 GtC yr -1 ) to estimate the overall uncertainty of the 2021 prediction.Like the ocean forecast, the land CO 2 sink (S LAND ) forecast is based on the annual historical and estimated 2021 atmospheric CO 2 concentration (Dlugokencky and Tans 2021), historical and estimated 2021 annual global fossil fuel emissions from this year's carbon budget, and the summer (June, July, August) ONI (NCEP, 2021).

        <p>The worldwide network of in situ atmospheric measurements and satellite-derived atmospheric CO 2 column (xCO 2 ) observations put a strong constraint on changes in the atmospheric abundance of CO 2 . This is true globally (hence our large confidence in G ATM ), but also regionally in regions with sufficient observational density found mostly in the extra-tropics. This allows atmospheric inversion methods to constrain the magnitude and location of the combined total surface CO 2 fluxes from all sources, including fossil and land-use change emissions and land and ocean CO 2 fluxes. The inversions assume E FOS to be well known, and they solve for the spatial and temporal distribution of land and ocean fluxes from the residual gradients of CO 2 between stations that are not explained by fossil fuel emissions. By design, such systems close the carbon balance (B IM = 0) and thus provide an additional perspective on the independent estimates of the ocean and land fluxes. This year's release includes six inversion systems that are described in Table A4. Each system is rooted in Bayesian inversion principles but uses slightly different methodologies. These differences concern the selection of atmospheric CO 2 data and the choice of a priori fluxes to refine with these data. They also differ in spatial and temporal resolution, assumed correlation structures, and mathematical approach of the models (see references in Table A4 for details). Importantly, the systems use a variety of transport models, which was demonstrated to be a driving factor behind differences in atmospheric inversion-based flux estimates, and specifically their distribution across latitudinal bands (Gaubert et al., 2019;Schuh et al., 2019). Multiple inversion systems (UoE, CTE, and CAMS) were previously tested with satellite xCO 2 retrievals from GOSAT or OCO-2 measurements, but their results at the larger scales (as discussed in this work) did not deviate substantially from their in situ counterparts and are therefore not separately included. One inversion this year (CMS-Flux) used ACOS-GOSAT v9 retrievals between July 2009 and December 2014 and OCO-2 b10 retrievals between January to December 2015, in addition to the in situ observational CO 2 mole fraction records.The worldwide network of in situ atmospheric measurements and satellite-derived atmospheric CO 2 column (xCO 2 ) observations put a strong constraint on changes in the atmospheric abundance of CO 2 .

        <p>The original products delivered by the inverse modellers were modified to facilitate the comparison to the other elements of the budget, specifically on three accounts: (1) global total fossil fuel emissions, (2) riverine CO 2 transport, and (3) cement carbonation CO 2 uptake. Details are given below. We note that with these adjustments the inverse results no longer represent the net atmosphere-surface exchange over land-ocean areas as sensed by atmospheric observations. Instead, for land, they become the net uptake of CO 2 by vegetation and soils that is not exported by fluvial systems, similar to the DGVM estimates. For oceans, they become the net uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 , similar to the GOBMs estimates.The original products delivered by the inverse modellers were modified to facilitate the comparison to the other elements of the budget, specifically on three accounts: (1) global total fossil fuel emissions, (2) riverine CO 2 transport, and (3) cement carbonation CO 2 uptake.

        <p>The inversion systems prescribe global fossil fuel emissions based on the GCP's Gridded Fossil Emissions Dataset version 2021.2 (GCP-GridFEDv2021.2; Jones et al., 2021b), which is an update to 2019 of the first version of GCP-GridFED presented by Jones et al. (2021a). GCP-GridFEDv2021.2 scales gridded estimates of CO 2 emissions from EDGARv4.3.2 (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019) within national territories to match national emissions estimates provided by the GCB for the years 1959-2020, which were compiled following the methodology described in Sect. 2.1 with all datasets available on 14 August 2021 (Robbie Andrew, personal communication, 2021). Small differences between the systems due to for instance regridding to the transport model resolution are corrected for in the latitudinal partitioning we present, to ensure agreement with the estimate of E FOS in this budget. We also note that the ocean fluxes used as prior by five out of six inversions are part of the suite of the ocean process model or f CO 2 data products listed in Sect. 2.4. Although these fluxes are further adjusted by the atmospheric inversions, it makes the inversion estimates of the ocean fluxes not completely independent of S OCEAN assessed here.The inversion systems prescribe global fossil fuel emissions based on the GCP's Gridded Fossil Emissions Dataset version 2021.2 (GCP-GridFEDv2021.2; Jones et al., 2021b), which is an update to 2019 of the first version of GCP-GridFED presented by Jones et al.

        <p>To facilitate comparisons to the independent S OCEAN and S LAND , we used the same corrections for transport and outgassing of carbon transported from land to ocean, as done for the observation-based estimates of S OCEAN (see Appendix C3). Furthermore, the inversions did not include a cement carbonation sink (see Sect. 2.1), and therefore this GCB component is implicitly part of their total land sink estimate. In the numbers presented in this budget, each year's global carbonation sink from cement was subtracted from each year's estimated land sink in each inversion, distributed proportionally to fossil fuel emissions per region (north, tropics, and south).To facilitate comparisons to the independent S OCEAN and S LAND , we used the same corrections for transport and outgassing of carbon transported from land to ocean, as done for the observation-based estimates of S OCEAN (see Appendix C3).

        <p>The atmospheric inversions are evaluated using vertical profiles of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (Fig. B4). More than 30 aircraft programmes over the globe, either regular programmes or repeated surveys over at least 9 months, have been used to assess model performance (with space-time observational coverage sparse in the SH and tropics, and denser in NH mid-latitudes; Table A6). The six models are compared to the independent aircraft CO 2 measurements between 2 and 7 km above sea level between 2001 and 2020.

        <p>For each component of the global carbon budget, we present results for three different time periods: the full historical period, from 1850 to 2020; the six decades in which we have atmospheric concentration records from Mauna Loa , with a specific focus on last year (2020); and the projection for the current year (2021). Subsequently, we assess the combined constraints from the budget components (often referred to as a bottom-up budget) against the top-down constraints from inverse modelling of atmospheric observations. We do this for the global balance of the last decade, as well as for a regional breakdown of land and ocean sinks by broad latitude bands.For each component of the global carbon budget, we present results for three different time periods: the full historical period, from 1850 to 2020; the six decades in which we have atmospheric concentration records from Mauna Loa , with a specific focus on last year (2020); and the projection for the current year (2021).

        <p>In 2020, the largest absolute contributions to global fossil CO 2 emissions were from China (31 %), the USA (14 %), the EU27 (7 %), and India (7 %). These four regions account for 59 % of global CO 2 emissions, while the rest of the world contributed 41 %, including international aviation and marine bunker fuels (2.9 % of the total). Growth rates for these countries from 2019 to 2020 were +1.4 % (China), -10.6 % (USA), -10.9 % (EU27), and -7.3 % (India), with -7.0 % for the rest of the world.

        <p>The COVID-19-induced decline in emissions of -5.4 % in 2020 is close to the projected decline of -6.7 %, which was the median of four approaches, published in Friedlingstein et al.

That method was based on national emissions projections for China, the USA, the EU27, and India using reported monthly activity data when available and projections of gross domestic product corrected for trends in fossil fuel intensity (I FOS ) for the rest of the world. Of the regions, the projection for the EU27 was the least accurate, and the reasons for this are discussed by Andrew (2021).The COVID-19-induced decline in emissions of -5.4 % in 2020 is close to the projected decline of -6.7 %, which was the median of four approaches, published in Friedlingstein et al.

        <p>In contrast to growing fossil emissions, CO 2 emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry have remained relatively constant, at around 1.3 ± 0.7 GtC yr -1 over the 1970-1999 period, and even show a slight decrease over the last 20 years, reaching 1.1 ± 0.7 GtC yr -1 for the 2011-2020 period (Table 6, Fig. 4), but with large spread across estimates (Table 5, Fig. 7). Emissions have been relatively constant in the DGVMs ensemble of models since the 1970s, with similar mean values until the 1990s as the bookkeeping mean and large model spread (Table 5, Fig. 7). The DGVMs average grows larger than the bookkeeping average in the recent decades and shows no sign of decreasing emissions, which is, however, expected as DGVM-based estimates include the loss of additional sink capacity, which grows with time, while the bookkeeping estimates do not (Appendix D4). E LUC is a net term of various gross fluxes, which comprise emissions and removals. Gross emissions are on average 2-4 times larger than the net E LUC emissions, and remained largely constant over the last 60 years, with a moderate increase from an average of 3.4 ± 0.9 GtC yr -1 for the decade of the 1960s to an average of 3.8 ± 0.6 GtC yr -1 during 2011-2020 (Fig. 7, Table 5), showing the relevance of land management such as harvesting or rotational agriculture. Increases in gross removals, from 1.9 ± 0.4 GtC yr -1 for the 1960s to 2.7 ± 0.4 GtC yr -1 for 2011-2020, were larger than the increase in gross emissions. Since the processes behind gross removals, foremost forest regrowth and soil recovery, are all slow, while gross emissions include a large instantaneous component, short-term changes in landuse dynamics, such as a temporary decrease in deforestation, influence gross emissions dynamics more than gross removal dynamics. It is these relative changes to each other that explain the decrease in net E LUC emissions over the last two decades and the last few years. Gross fluxes differ more across the three bookkeeping estimates than net fluxes, which is expected due to different process representation; in partic-Table 6.

        <p>There is a decrease in net CO 2 emissions from land-use change over the last decade (Fig. 7, Table 6), in contrast to earlier estimates of no clear trend across E LUC estimates (Friedlingstein et al., 2020;Hong et al., 2021). The trend in the last decade is now about -4 % yr -1 , compared to the +1.8 % yr -1 reported by Friedlingstein et al. (2020). This decrease is principally attributable to changes in E LUC estimates from BLUE and OSCAR, which relate to changes in the underlying land-use forcing, LUH2 (Chini et al., 2021;Hurtt et al., 2020), based on HYDE3.3 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017a, b): HYDE3.3 now incorporates updated estimates of agricultural areas by the FAO and uses multi-annual land-cover maps from satellite remote sensing (ESA CCI Land Cover) to constrain contemporary land-cover patterns (see Appendix C2.2 for details). These changes lead to lower global E LUC estimates in the last two decades compared to earlier versions of the global carbon budget due most notably to lower emissions from cropland expansion, particularly in the tropical regions. Rosan et al. (2021) showed that for Brazil, the new HYDE3.3 version is closer to independent, regional estimates of land-use and land-cover change (MapBiomas, 2021) with respect to spatial patterns, but it shows less land-use and land-cover changes than these independent estimates, while HYDE3.2-based estimates had shown higher changes and lower emissions. The update in land-use forcing leads to a decrease in estimated emissions in Brazil across several models after the documented deforestation peak of 2003-2004 that preceded policies and monitoring systems decreasing deforestation rates (Rosan et al., 2021). However, estimated emissions based on the new land-use forcing do not reflect the rise in Brazilian deforestation in the last few years (Silva Junior et al., 2021), and associated increasing emissions from deforestation would have been missed here. The update in FAO agricultural areas in Brazil also implied that substantial interannual variability reported to earlier FAO assessment and captured by the HYDE3.2 version since 2000 was removed. Due to the asymmetry of (fast) decay (like clearing by fire) and (slower) regrowth, such reduced variability is expected to decrease annual emissions. Also, the approach by Houghton and Nassikas (2017) smooths land-use area changes before calculating carbon fluxes by a 5-year running mean, hence the three emission estimates are in better agreement than in previous GCB estimates. However, differences still exist, which highlight the need for accurate knowledge of land-use transitions and their spatial and temporal variability. A further caveat is that global land-use change data for model input does not capture forest degradation, which often occurs on small scales or without forest cover changes easily detectable from remote sensing and poses a growing threat to forest area and carbon stocks that may surpass deforestation effects (e.g. Matricardi et al., 2020;Qin et al., 2021).There is a decrease in net CO 2 emissions from land-use change over the last decade (Fig. 7, Table 6), in contrast to earlier estimates of no clear trend across E LUC estimates (Friedlingstein et al., 2020;Hong et al., 2021). The trend in the last decade is now about -4 % yr -1 , compared to the +1.8 % yr -1 reported by Friedlingstein et al. (2020). This decrease is principally attributable to changes in E LUC estimates from BLUE and OSCAR, which relate to changes in the underlying land-use forcing, LUH2 (Chini et al., 2021;Hurtt et al., 2020), based on HYDE3.3 (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017a, b): HYDE3.3 now incorporates updated estimates of agricultural areas by the FAO and uses multi-annual land-cover maps from satellite remote sensing (ESA CCI Land Cover) to constrain contemporary land-cover patterns (see Appendix C2.2 for details). These changes lead to lower global E LUC estimates in the last two decades compared to earlier versions of the global carbon budget due most notably to lower emissions from cropland expansion, particularly in the tropical regions. Rosan et al. (2021) showed that for Brazil, the new HYDE3.3 version is closer to independent, regional estimates of land-use and land-cover change (MapBiomas, 2021) with respect to spatial patterns, but it shows less land-use and land-cover changes than these independent estimates, while HYDE3.2-based estimates had shown higher changes and lower emissions. The update in land-use forcing leads to a decrease in estimated emissions in Brazil across several models after the documented deforestation peak of 2003-2004 that preceded policies and monitoring systems decreasing deforestation rates (Rosan et al., 2021). However, estimated emissions based on the new land-use forcing do not reflect the rise in Brazilian deforestation in the last few years (Silva Junior et al., 2021), and associated increasing emissions from deforestation would have been missed here. The update in FAO agricultural areas in Brazil also implied that substantial interannual variability reported to earlier FAO assessment and captured by the HYDE3.2 version since 2000 was removed. Due to the asymmetry of (fast) decay (like clearing by fire) and (slower) regrowth, such reduced variability is expected to decrease annual emissions. Also, the approach by Houghton and Nassikas (2017) smooths land-use area changes before calculating carbon fluxes by a 5-year running mean, hence the three emission estimates are in better agreement than in previous GCB estimates. However, differences still exist, which highlight the need for accurate knowledge of land-use transitions and their spatial and temporal variability. A further caveat is that global land-use change data for model input does not capture forest degradation, which often occurs on small scales or without forest cover changes easily detectable from remote sensing and poses a growing threat to forest area and carbon stocks that may surpass deforestation effects (e.g. Matricardi et al., 2020;Qin et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>Overall, therefore, we assign low confidence to the change towards a decreasing trend of land-use emissions over the last two decades as seen compared to the estimate of the global carbon budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Our approach aims at using the most up-to-date data and methods, such as accounting for revisions of living databases of country-level agricultural statistics from FAO or including satellite remote-sensing information for spatial allocation. While we start from a well-documented methodology to provide gridded land-use data (Chini et al., 2021), not all changes in individual components are always documented, complicating the explanation of changes from one GCB to the next. The rising number of pan-tropical or global estimates of carbon stock changes based on satellite remote sensing of carbon densities and forest cover changes (Fan et al., 2019;Qin et al., 2021;Xu et al., 2022;Feng et al., 2022) may seem a promising path for independent evaluation of the land-use emissions term. However, comparison of satellitederived fluxes to global model estimates is hampered for several reasons discussed by Pongratz et al. (2021). Most importantly, satellite-based estimates usually do not distinguish between anthropogenic drivers and natural forest cover losses (e.g. from drought or natural wildfires), which have also increased over time in some regions, including the tropics; ancillary information would be needed to attribute the ob-served signal of vegetation or carbon stock change to different drivers. Further, satellite-based estimates often only provide sub-component fluxes of E LUC , excluding soil or product pool changes. Since forest cover loss is better detectable from space than regrowth, satellite-based products often limit their estimates to emissions from forest loss, neglecting carbon uptake from regrowth of forests, as may occur following wood harvesting, abandonment, or natural disturbances; such products thus provide a subset of the gross emissions term (Fig. 7b) and cannot be compared to net emissions. Lastly, satellite-based fluxes typically quantify committed instead of actual emissions, i.e. legacy CO 2 fluxes from potentially slow processes such as slash, soil carbon or product decay, or forest regrowth are not captured at the time they actually occur but are attributed to the time of the land-use change event (Pongratz et al., 2021). Using data on drivers of forest cover loss to isolate fluxes from agricultural expansion, and looking into gross emissions instead of the net land-use change flux, Feng et al. (2022) suggest a stronger increase in global gross emissions (though generally a smaller flux) than the bookkeeping models do (see gross fluxes in Fig. 7b). This is in line with Rosan et al. (2021) suggesting that the trend of net emissions in Brazil may be underestimated by the updated land-use data (though patterns have improved). Further studies are needed to robustly estimate the trend of global net land-use emissions. Progress is also needed on accurate quantifications of land-use dynamics, including less well observable management types such as shifting cultivation and wood harvesting, and their distinction from natural disturbances (Pongratz et al., 2021).Overall, therefore, we assign low confidence to the change towards a decreasing trend of land-use emissions over the last two decades as seen compared to the estimate of the global carbon budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).

        <p>The highest land-use emissions occur in the tropical regions of all three continents, including the Arc of Deforestation in the Amazon basin (Fig. 6b). This is related to massive expansion of cropland, particularly in the last few decades in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa (Hong et al., 2021), to a substantial extent for export (Pendrill et al., 2019). Emission intensity is high in many tropical countries, particularly of Southeast Asia, due to high rates of land conversion in regions of carbon-dense and often still pristine, undegraded natural forests (Hong et al., 2021). Emissions are further increased by peat fires in equatorial Asia (GFED4s, van der Werf et al., 2017). Uptake due to land-use change occurs, particularly in Europe, partly related to expanding forest area as a consequence of the forest transition in the 19th and 20th century and subsequent regrowth of forest (Fig. 6b) (Mather, 2001;McGrath et al., 2015).The highest land-use emissions occur in the tropical regions of all three continents, including the Arc of Deforestation in the Amazon basin (Fig. 6b).

        <p>National GHG inventory data (NGHGI) under the LU-LUCF sector or data submitted by countries to FAOSTAT differ from the global models' definition of E LUC we adopt here in that in the NGHGI reporting, the natural fluxes (S LAND ) are counted towards E LUC when they occur on managed land (Grassi et al., 2018). In order to compare our results to the NGHGI approach, we perform a re-mapping of our E LUC estimate by including the S LAND over managed forest from the 
            <rs type="software">DGVM</rs> simulations (following Grassi et al., 2021) to the bookkeeping E LUC estimate (see Appendix C2.3). For the 2011-2020 period, we estimate that 1.5 GtC yr -1 of S LAND occurred on managed forests and is then reallocated to E LUC here, as done in the NGHGI method. Doing so, our mean estimate of E LUC is reduced from a source of 1.1 GtC to a sink of -0.4 GtC, very similar to the NGHGI estimate of -0.6 GtC (Table A8).

        <p>Though estimates between GHGI, FAOSTAT, individual process-based models, and the mapped budget estimates still differ in value and need further analysis, the approach taken here provides a possibility to relate the global models' and NGHGI approach to each other routinely and thus link the anthropogenic carbon budget estimates of land CO 2 fluxes directly to the Global Stocktake, as part of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement.Though estimates between GHGI, FAOSTAT, individual process-based models, and the mapped budget estimates still differ in value and need further analysis, the approach taken here provides a possibility to relate the global models' and NGHGI approach to each other routinely and thus link the anthropogenic carbon budget estimates of land CO 2 fluxes directly to the Global Stocktake, as part of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>The global CO 2 emissions from land-use change are estimated as 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC in 2020, 0.2 GtC lower than 2019, which had featured particularly large peat and tropical deforestation and degradation fires. The surge in deforestation fires in the Amazon, causing about 30 % higher emissions from deforestation and degradation fires in 2019 over the previous decade, continued into 2020 (GFED4.1s, van der Werf et al., 2017). However, the unusually dry conditions for a non-El Niño year that occurred in Indonesia in 2019 and led to fire emissions from peat burning, deforestation, and degradation in equatorial Asia to be about twice as large as the average over the previous decade (GFED4.1s, van der Werf et al., 2017) ceased in 2020. However, confidence in the annual change remains low. While the mentioned fires are clearly attributable to land-use activity, foremost deforestation and peat burning, and may have been reinforced by dry weather conditions, as was the case in Indonesia in 2019, wildfires also occur naturally. In particular, the extreme fire events in recent years in Australia, Siberia, and California were unrelated to land-use change and are thus not attributed to E LUC , but to the natural land sink, and are discussed in Sect. 3.6.2.The global CO 2 emissions from land-use change are estimated as 0.9 ± 0.7 GtC in 2020, 0.2 GtC lower than 2019, which had featured particularly large peat and tropical deforestation and degradation fires.

        <p>Land-use change and related emissions may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Poulter et al., 2021). Although emissions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires have been decreasing from 2019 to 2020 on the global scale, they increased in Latin America (GFED4s; van der Werf et al., 2017). During the period of the pandemic, environmental protection policies and their implementation may have been weakened in Brazil (Vale et al., 2021). In other countries, too, monitoring capacities and legal enforcement of measures to reduce tropical deforestation have been reduced due to budget restrictions of environmental agencies or impairments to ground-based monitoring that prevents land grabs and tenure conflicts (Brancalion et al., 2020;Amador-Jiménez et al., 2020). Effects of the pandemic on trends in fire activity or forest cover changes are hard to separate from those of general political developments and environmental changes, and the long-term consequences of disruptions in agricultural and forestry economic activities (e.g. Gruère and Brooks, 2020;Golar et al., 2020;Beckman and Countryman, 2021) remain to be seen.Land-use change and related emissions may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Poulter et al., 2021).

By the end of September 2021 emissions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires were estimated to be 222 TgC, down from 347 TgC in 2019 and 288 in 2020 (315 TgC 1997-2020 average). Peat fire emissions in equatorial Asia were estimated to be 1 TgC, down from 117 TgC in 2019 and 2 TgC in 2020 (74 TgC 1997-2020 average) (GFED4.1s, van der Werf et al., 2017). Based on the fire emissions until the end of September, we expect E LUC emissions of around 0.8 GtC in 2021. Note that although our extrapolation is based on tropical deforestation and degradation fires, degradation attributable to selective logging, edge effects, or fragmentation will not be captured.With wet conditions in Indonesia and a below-average fire season in South America our preliminary estimate of E LUC for 2021 is substantially lower than the 2011-2020 average.

So far, there is no indication of a decrease in the ocean-borne fraction from 1960 to 2020. The increase in the ocean sink is primarily driven by the increased atmospheric CO 2 concentration, with the strongest CO 2 -induced signal in the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean (Fig. 10a). The effect of climate change is much weaker, reducing the ocean sink globally by 0.12 ± 0.07 GtC yr -1 or 5 % (2011-2020, range -0.8 % to -7.4 %), and does not show clear spatial patterns across the GOBMs ensemble (Fig. 10b).

        <p>The global net air-sea CO 2 flux is a residual of large natural and anthropogenic CO 2 fluxes into and out of the ocean with distinct regional and seasonal variations (Figs. 6 andB1). Natural fluxes dominate on regional scales but largely cancel out when integrated globally (Gruber et al., 2009). Mid-latitudes in all basins and the high-latitude North Atlantic dominate the ocean CO 2 uptake where low temperatures and high wind speeds facilitate CO 2 uptake at the surface (Takahashi et al., 2009). In these regions, mode, intermediate, and deep-water masses are formed that transport an-thropogenic carbon into the ocean interior, thus allowing for continued CO 2 uptake at the surface. Outgassing of natural CO 2 occurs mostly in the tropics, especially in the equatorial upwelling region, and to a lesser extent in the North Pacific and polar Southern Ocean, mirroring a well-established understanding of regional patterns of air-sea CO 2 exchange (e.g. Takahashi et al., 2009;Gruber et al., 2009). These patterns are also noticeable in the Surface Ocean CO 2 Atlas (SOCAT) dataset, where an ocean f CO 2 value above the atmospheric level indicates outgassing (Fig. B1).

        <p>Interannual variability of the ocean carbon sink is driven by climate variability with a first-order effect from a stronger ocean sink during large El Niño events (e.g. 1997-1998) (Fig. 9; Rödenbeck et al., 2014;Hauck et al., 2020). The GOBMs show the same patterns of decadal variability as the mean of the f CO 2 -based data products, with a stagnation of the ocean sink in the 1990s and a strengthening since the early 2000s (Fig. 9, Le Quéré et al., 2007;Landschützer et al., 2015Landschützer et al., , 2016;;DeVries et al., 2017;Hauck et al., 2020;McKinley et al., 2020). Different explanations have been proposed for this decadal variability, ranging from the ocean's response to changes in atmospheric wind and pressure systems (e.g. Le Quéré et al., 2007;Keppler and Landschützer, 2019), including variations in upper ocean overturning circulation (DeVries et al., 2017), to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo and its effects on sea surface temperature and slowed atmospheric CO 2 growth rate in the 1990s (McKinley et al., 2020). The main origin of the decadal variability is a matter of debate with a number of studies initially pointing to the Southern Ocean (see review in Canadell et al., 2022), but also contributions from the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Landschützer et al., 2016;DeVries et al., 2019) or a global signal (McKinley et al., 2020) were proposed.Interannual variability of the ocean carbon sink is driven by climate variability with a first-order effect from a stronger ocean sink during large El Niño events (e.g. 1997-1998) (Fig. 9; Rödenbeck et al., 2014;Hauck et al., 2020).

        <p>Although all individual GOBMs and data products fall within the observational constraint, the ensemble means of GOBMs and data products adjusted for the riverine flux diverge over time with a mean offset increasing from 0.24 GtC yr -1 in the 1990s to 0.66 GtC yr -1 in the decade 2011-2020 and reaching 1.1 GtC yr -1 in 2020.

The GOBM estimate is lower than in the previous global carbon budget (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), because one high-sink model was not available.

        <p>The discrepancy between the two types of estimates stems mostly from a larger Southern Ocean sink in the data products prior to 2001, and from a larger S OCEAN trend in the northern and southern extra-tropics since then (Fig. 12). Possible explanations for the discrepancy in the Southern Ocean could be missing winter observations and data sparsity in general (Bushinsky et al., 2019;Gloege et al., 2021), model biases (as indicated by the large model spread in the south, Fig. 12, and the larger model-data mismatch, Fig. B2), or uncertainties in the regional river flux adjustment (Hauck et al., 2020;Lacroix et al., 2020).The discrepancy between the two types of estimates stems mostly from a larger Southern Ocean sink in the data products prior to 2001, and from a larger S OCEAN trend in the northern and southern extra-tropics since then (Fig. 12).

        <p>During 2010-2016, the ocean CO 2 sink appears to have intensified in line with the expected increase from atmospheric CO 2 (McKinley et al., 2020).

The reduction of -0.09 GtC yr -1 (range: -0.30 to +0.12 GtC yr -1 ) in the ocean CO 2 sink in 2017 is consistent with the return to normal conditions after the El Niño in 2015-2016, which caused an enhanced sink in previous years.

        <p>The estimated ocean CO 2 sink was 3.0 ± 0.4 GtC in 2020. This is the average of GOBMs and data products, and is a small increase of 0.02 GtC compared to 2019, in line with the competing effects from an expected sink strengthening from atmospheric CO 2 growth and expected sink weakening from La Niña conditions. There is, however, a substantial difference between GOBMs and f CO 2 -based data products in their mean 2020 S OCEAN estimate (GOBMs: 2.5 GtC, data products: 3.5 GtC). While the GOBMs simulate a stagnation of the sink from 2019 to 2020 (-0.02 ± 0.11 GtC), the data products suggest an increase by 0.06 GtC, although not significant at the 1σ level (±0.13 GtC). Four models and four data products show an increase in S OCEAN (GOBMs up to +0.18 GtC, data product up to +0.21 GtC), while four models and three data products show no change or a decrease in S OCEAN (GOBMs down to -0.12 GtC, data products down to -0.13 GtC; Fig. 9). The data products have a larger uncertainty at the tails of the reconstructed time series (e.g. Watson et al., 2020).

The GOBMs RMSEs are larger and range from 3.3 to 5.9 µatm. The RMSEs are generally larger at high latitudes compared to the tropics, for both the data products and the GOBMs. The data products have RMSEs of 1.3 to 3.6 µatm in the tropics, 1.3 to 2.7 µatm in the north, and 2.2 to 6.1 µatm in the south.

        <p>Over the period 1960 to present the increase in the global terrestrial CO 2 sink is largely attributed to the CO 2 fertilization effect in the models (Prentice et al., 2001;Piao et al., 2009), directly stimulating plant photosynthesis and increased plant water use in water-limited systems, with a small negative contribution of climate change (Fig. 10). There is a range of evidence to support a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to increasing atmospheric CO 2 , albeit with uncertain magnitude (Walker et al., 2021). As expected from theory the greatest CO 2 effect is simulated in the tropical forest regions, associated with warm temperatures and long growing seasons (Hickler et al., 2008) (Fig. 10a). However, evidence from tropical intact forest plots indicate an overall decline in the land sink across Amazonia , attributed to enhanced mortality offsetting productivity gains (Brienen et al., 2005;Hubau et al., 2020). During 2011-2020 the land sink is positive in all regions (Fig. 6) with the exception of central and eastern Brazil, southwest USA and northern Mexico, southeast Europe and central Asia, South Africa, and eastern Australia, where the negative effects of climate variability and change (i.e. reduced rainfall) counterbalance CO 2 effects. This is clearly visible in Fig. 10 where the effects of CO 2 (Fig. 10a) and climate (Fig. 10b) as simulated by the DGVMs are isolated. The negative effect of climate is the strongest in most of South America, Central America, southwest USA, and central Europe (Fig. 10b).

        <p>In the past years several regions experienced recordsetting fire events. While global burned area has declined over the past decades mostly due to declining fire activity in savannas (Andela et al., 2017), forest fire emissions are rising and have the potential to counter the negative fire trend in savannas (Zheng et al., 2021). Noteworthy events include the 2019-2020 Black Summer event in Australia (emissions of roughly 0.2 GtC; van der Velde et al., 2021) and Siberia in 2021, where emissions approached 0.4 GtC or 3 times the 1997-2020 average according to GFED4s. While other regions, including western USA and Mediterranean Europe, also experienced intense fire seasons in 2021 their emissions are substantially lower.

        <p>The distributions based on the individual models and data products reveal substantial spread but converge near the decadal means quoted in Tables 5 and6. Sink estimates for S OCEAN and from inverse models are mostly non-Gaussian, while the ensemble of DGVMs appears more normally distributed justifying the use of a multi-model mean and standard deviation for their errors in the budget. Noteworthy is that the tails of the distributions provided by the land and ocean bottom-up estimates would not agree with the global constraint provided by the fossil fuel emissions and the observed atmospheric CO 2 growth rate (E FOS -G ATM ).

        <p>For the 2011-2020 period, the GOBMs (2.5 ± 0.6 GtC yr -1 ) produce a lower estimate for the ocean sink than the f CO 2 - based data products (3.1 ± 0.5 GtC yr -1 ), which shows up in Fig. 11 as a separate peak in the distribution from the GOBMs (triangle symbols pointing right) and from the f CO 2 -based products (triangle symbols pointing left). Atmospheric inversions (2.6 to 3.1 GtC yr -1 ) also suggest higher ocean uptake in the recent decade (Fig. 11, Fig. 12 top row). In interpreting these differences, we caution that the riverine transport of carbon taken up on land and outgassing from the ocean is a substantial (0.6 GtC yr -1 ) and uncertain term that separates the various methods. A recent estimate of decadal ocean uptake from observed O 2 / N 2 ratios (Tohjima et al., 2019) also points towards a larger ocean sink, albeit with large uncertainty (2012-2016: 3.1 ± 1.5 GtC yr -1 ).

        <p>The interannual variability in the southern extra-tropics is low because of the dominance of ocean area with low variability compared to land areas. The split between land (S LAND -E LUC ) and ocean (S OCEAN ) shows a substantial contribution to variability in the south coming from the land, with no consistency between the DGVMs and the inversions or among inversions. This is expected due to the difficulty of separating exactly the land and oceanic fluxes when viewed from atmospheric observations alone.

The larger agreement across DGVMs than across inversions is to be expected as there is no correlation between northern and tropical land sinks in the DGVMs as opposed to the inversions where the sum of the two regions being well-constrained leads to an anti-correlation between these two regions. The much smaller spread in the N-S difference between the DGVMs could help to scrutinize the inverse models further. For example, a large northern land sink and a tropical land source in an inversion would suggest a large sensitivity to CO 2 fertilization (the dominant factor driving the land sinks) for northern ecosystems, which would be not mirrored by tropical ecosystems. Such a combination could be hard to reconcile with the process understanding gained from the DGVMs ensembles and independent measurements (e.g. free-air CO 2 enrichment experiments).

The total emissions were partitioned among the atmosphere (205 ± 5 GtC; 47 %), ocean (115 ± 25 GtC; 25 %), and the land (135 ± 25 GtC; 30 %), with a near-zero unattributed budget imbalance. All components except land-use change emissions have significantly grown since 1960, with important interannual variability in the growth rate in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and in the land CO 2 sink (Fig. 4), and some decadal variability in all terms (Table 6). Differences with previous budget releases are documented in Fig. B5.For the more recent 1960-2020 period where direct atmospheric CO 2 measurements are available, 375 ± 20 GtC (82 %) of the total emissions (E FOS + E LUC ) were caused by fossil CO 2 emissions, and 80 ± 45 GtC (18 %) by landuse change (Table 8).

        <p>The global carbon budget averaged over the last decade (2011-2020) is shown in Figs. 2 and 13b and Table 6. For this time period, 90 % of the total emissions (E FOS +E LUC ) were from fossil CO 2 emissions (E FOS ), and 10 % from land-use change (E LUC ). The total emissions were partitioned among the atmosphere (47 %), ocean (26 %), and land (29 %), with a near-zero unattributed budget imbalance (∼ 3 %). For single years, the budget imbalance can be larger (Fig. 4). For 2020, the combination of our sources and sinks estimates leads to a B IM of -0.8 GtC, suggesting an underestimation of the anthropogenic sources (potentially E LUC ), and/or an overestimation of the combined land and ocean sinksThe global carbon budget averaged over the last decade (2011-2020) is shown in Figs. 2 and 13b and Table 6.

        <p>The carbon budget imbalance (B IM ; Eq. 1, Fig. 4) quantifies the mismatch between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, land, and ocean reservoirs. The mean budget imbalance from 1960 to 2020 is very small (average of 0.03 GtC yr -1 ) and shows no trend over the full time series. The process models (GOBMs and DGVMs) and data products have been selected to match observational constraints in the 1990s, but no further constraints have been applied to their representation of trend and variability. Therefore, the near-zero mean and trend in the budget imbalance is seen as evidence of a coherent community understanding of the emissions and their partitioning on those timescales (Fig. 4). However, the budget imbalance shows substantial variability of the order of ±1 GtC yr -1 , particularly over semi-decadal timescales, although most of the variability is within the uncertainty of the estimates. The positive carbon imbalance during the 1960s, and early 1990s, indicates that either the emissions were overestimated, or the sinks were underestimated during these periods. The reverse is true for the 1970s, 1980s, and for the 2011-2020 period (Fig. 4, Table 6).The carbon budget imbalance (B IM ; Eq. 1, Fig. 4) quantifies the mismatch between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, land, and ocean reservoirs.

        <p>We cannot attribute the cause of the variability in the budget imbalance with our analysis; we only note that the budget imbalance is unlikely to be explained by errors or biases in the emissions alone because of its large semidecadal variability component, a variability that is untypical of emissions and has not changed in the past 60 years despite a near tripling in emissions (Fig. 4). Errors in S LAND and S OCEAN are more likely to be the main cause for the budget imbalance. For example, underestimation of S LAND by DGVMs has been reported following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 possibly due to missing responses to changes in diffuse radiation (Mercado et al., 2009). Although in GCB2021 we have for the first time accounted for aerosol effects on solar radiation quantity and quality (diffuse vs. direct), most DGVMs only used the former as input (i.e. total solar radiation). Thus, the ensemble mean may not capture the full effects of volcanic eruptions, i.e. associated with high light scattering sulfate aerosols, on the land carbon sink (O'Sullivan et al., 2021). DGVMs are suspected to overestimate the land sink in response to the wet decade of the 1970s (Sitch et al., 2008). Quasi-decadal variability in the ocean sink has also been reported, with all methods agreeing on a smaller than expected ocean CO 2 sink in the 1990s and a larger than expected sink in the 2000s (Fig. 9; Landschützer et al., 2016;DeVries et al., 2019;Hauck et al., 2020;McKinley et al., 2020). Errors in sink estimates could also be driven by errors in the climatic forcing data, particularly precipitation for S LAND and wind for S OCEAN .We cannot attribute the cause of the variability in the budget imbalance with our analysis; we only note that the budget imbalance is unlikely to be explained by errors or biases in the emissions alone because of its large semidecadal variability component, a variability that is untypical of emissions and has not changed in the past 60 years despite a near tripling in emissions (Fig. 4).

        <p>The budget imbalance (B IM ) was negative (-0.3 GtC yr -1 ) on average over 2011-2020, although the B I M uncertainty is large (1.1 GtC yr -1 over the decade). Also, the B IM shows substantial departure from zero on yearly timescales (Fig. 4), highlighting unresolved variability of the carbon cycle, likely in the land sink (S LAND ), given its large year-to-year variability (Figs. 4e and7).The budget imbalance (B IM ) was negative (-0.3 GtC yr -1 ) on average over 2011-2020, although the B I M uncertainty is large (1.1 GtC yr -1 over the decade).

        <p>Both the budget imbalance (B IM , Table 6) and the residual land sink from the global budget (E FOS + E LUC -G ATM -S OCEAN , Table 5) include an error term due to the inconsistencies that arise from using E LUC from bookkeeping models, and S LAND from DGVMs, most notably the loss of additional sink capacity (see Sect. 2.7). Other differences include a better accounting of changing land-use practices and processes in bookkeeping models than in DGVMs, or the bookkeeping models' error of having present-day observed carbon densities fixed in the past. That the budget imbalance shows no clear trend towards larger values over time is an indication that these inconsistencies probably play a minor role compared to other errors in S LAND or S OCEAN .Both the budget imbalance (B IM , Table 6) and the residual land sink from the global budget (E FOS + E LUC -G ATM -S OCEAN , Table 5) include an error term due to the inconsistencies that arise from using E LUC from bookkeeping models, and S LAND from DGVMs, most notably the loss of additional sink capacity (see Sect. 2.7).

        <p>Although the budget imbalance is near zero for the recent decades, it could be due to compensation of errors. We cannot exclude an overestimation of CO 2 emissions, particularly from land-use change, given their large uncertainty, as has been suggested elsewhere (Piao et al., 2018), combined with an underestimate of the sinks. A larger S LAND would reconcile model results with inversion estimates for fluxes in the total land during the past decade (Fig. 12; Table 5). Likewise, a larger S OCEAN is also possible given the higher estimates from the data products (see Sect. 3.1.2, Figs. 9 and 12) and the recently suggested upward correction of the ocean carbon sink (Watson et al., 2020, Fig. 9). If S OCEAN were to be based on data products alone, with all data products including the Watson et al. (2020) adjustment, this would result in a 2011-2020 S OCEAN of nearly 4 GtC yr -1 , outside of the range supported by the atmospheric inversions, with a negative B IM of more than 1 GtC yr -1 indicating that a closure of the budget could only be achieved with either anthropogenic emissions being larger and/or the net land sink being substantially smaller than estimated here. More integrated use of observations in the Global Carbon Budget, either on their own or for further constraining model results, should help resolve some of the budget imbalance (Peters et al., 2017). the last decade, however, the growth rate for the preceding 10 years has slowly declined, reaching a low +0.4 % yr -1 from 2012-2021 (including the 2020 global decline and the expected 2021 emissions rebound). While this slowdown in global fossil CO 2 emissions growth is welcome, it is far from what is needed to be consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.Although the budget imbalance is near zero for the recent decades, it could be due to compensation of errors.

        <p>Since the 1990s, the average growth rate of fossil CO 2 emissions has continuously declined across the group of developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with emissions peaking in around 2005 and now declining at around 1 % yr -1 (Le Quéré et al., 2021). In the decade 2010-2019, territorial fossil CO 2 emissions decreased significantly (at the 95 % confidence level) in 23 countries whose economies grew significantly (also at the 95 % confidence level): Barbados, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Sweden, Switzerland, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, and USA (updated from Le Quéré et al., 2019). Altogether, these 23 countries contributed 2.5 GtC yr -1 over the last decade, about one-quarter of world CO 2 fossil emissions. Consumption-based emissions are also falling significantly in 15 of these countries (Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, United Kingdom, and USA). Figure 14 shows that the emission declines in the USA and the EU27 are primarily driven by increased decarbonization (CO 2 emissions per unit energy) in the last decade compared to the previous, with smaller contributions in the EU27 from slightly weaker economic growth and slightly larger declines in energy per GDP. These countries have stable or declining energy use and so decarbonization policies replace existing fossil fuel infrastructure (Le Quéré et al., 2019).Since the 1990s, the average growth rate of fossil CO 2 emissions has continuously declined across the group of developed countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with emissions peaking in around 2005 and now declining at around 1 % yr -1 (Le Quéré et al., 2021).

        <p>In contrast, fossil CO 2 emissions continue to grow in non-OECD countries, although the growth rate has slowed from over 5 % yr -1 during the 2000s to around 2 % yr -1 in the last decade. A large part of this slowdown in non-OECD countries is due to China, which has seen emissions growth declining from nearly 10 % yr -1 in the 2000s to 2 % yr -1 in the last decade. Excluding China, non-OECD emissions grew at 3 % yr -1 in the 2000s compared to 2 % yr -1 in the last decade. Figure 14 shows that compared to the previous decade, China has had weaker economic growth in the last decade and a larger decarbonization rate, with more rapid declines in energy per GDP which are now back to levels during the 1990s. India and the rest of the world have strong economic growth that is not compensated by decarbonization or declines in energy per GDP, implying fossil CO 2 emissions continue to grow.

        <p>Globally, fossil CO 2 emissions growth is slowing, and this is primarily due to the emergence of climate policy and emission declines in OECD countries (Eskander and Fankhauser, 2020). At the aggregated global level, decarbonization shows a strong and growing signal in the last decade, with smaller contributions from lower economic growth and declines in energy per GDP. Despite the slowing growth in global fossil CO 2 emissions, emissions are still growing, far from the reductions needed to meet the ambitious climate goals of the UNFCCC Paris agreement.Globally, fossil CO 2 emissions growth is slowing, and this is primarily due to the emergence of climate policy and emission declines in OECD countries (Eskander and Fankhauser, 2020).

        <p>We update the remaining carbon budget assessed by the IPCC AR6 (Canadell et al., 2022), accounting for the 2020 and estimated 2021 emissions from fossil fuel combustion (E FOS ) and land-use changes (E LUC ). From January 2022, the remaining carbon (50 % likelihood) for limiting global warming to 1.5, 1.7, and 2 • C is estimated to amount to 120, 210, and 350 GtC (420, 770, 1270 GtCO 2 ). These numbers include an uncertainty based on model spread (as in IPCC AR6), which is reflected through the percent likelihood of exceeding the given temperature threshold. These remaining amounts correspond respectively to about 11, 20, and 32 years from the beginning of 2022, at the 2021 level of total CO 2 emissions. Reaching net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050 entails cutting total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions by about 0.4 GtC (1.4 GtCO 2 ) each year on average, comparable to the decrease during 2020.We update the remaining carbon budget assessed by the IPCC AR6 (Canadell et al., 2022), accounting for the 2020 and estimated 2021 emissions from fossil fuel combustion (E FOS ) and land-use changes (E LUC ).

        <p>Each year when the global carbon budget is published, each flux component is updated for all previous years to consider corrections that are the result of further scrutiny and verification of the underlying data in the primary input datasets.

Of all terms in the global budget, only the fossil CO 2 emissions and the growth rate in atmospheric CO 2 concentration are based primarily on empirical inputs supporting annual estimates in this carbon budget.

        <p>The persistent unexplained variability in the carbon budget imbalance limits our ability to verify reported emissions (Peters et al., 2017) and suggests we do not yet have a complete understanding of the underlying carbon cycle dynamics on annual to decadal timescales. Resolving most of this unexplained variability should be possible through different and complementary approaches. First, as intended with our annual updates, the imbalance as an error term is reduced by improvements of individual components of the global carbon budget that follow from improving the underlying data and statistics and by improving the models through the resolution of some of the key uncertainties detailed in Table 9. Second, additional clues to the origin and processes responsible for the variability in the budget imbalance could be obtained through a closer scrutiny of carbon variability in light of other Earth system data (e.g. heat balance, water balance), and the use of a wider range of biogeochemical observations to better understand the land-ocean partitioning of the carbon imbalance (e.g. oxygen, carbon isotopes). Finally, additional information could also be obtained through higher resolution and process knowledge at the regional level, and through the introduction of inferred fluxes such as those based on satellite CO 2 retrievals. The limit of the resolution of the carbon budget imbalance is yet unclear, but most certainly not yet reached given the possibilities for improvements that lie ahead.The persistent unexplained variability in the carbon budget imbalance limits our ability to verify reported emissions (Peters et al., 2017) and suggests we do not yet have a complete understanding of the underlying carbon cycle dynamics on annual to decadal timescales.

        <p>Estimates of global fossil CO 2 emissions from different datasets are in relatively good agreement when the different system boundaries of these datasets are considered (Andrew, 2020a). But while estimates of E FOS are derived from reported activity data requiring much fewer complex transformations than some other components of the budget, uncertainties remain, and one reason for the apparently low variation between datasets is precisely the reliance on the same underlying reported energy data. The budget excludes some sources of fossil CO 2 emissions, which available evidence suggests are relatively small (&lt; 1 %). We have added emissions from lime production in China and the US, but these are still absent in most other non-Annex I countries, and before Andrew and Peters (2021).Estimates of global fossil CO 2 emissions from different datasets are in relatively good agreement when the different system boundaries of these datasets are considered (Andrew, 2020a).

        <p>Estimates of E LUC suffer from a range of intertwined issues, including the poor quality of historical land-cover and land-use change maps, the rudimentary representation of management processes in most models, and the confusion in methodologies and boundary conditions used across methods (e.g. Arneth et al., 2017;Pongratz et al., 2014; see also Sect. 2.7.4 on the loss of sink capacity; Bastos et al., 2021). Uncertainties in current and historical carbon stocks in soils and vegetation also add uncertainty in the E LUC estimates. Unless a major effort to resolve these issues is made, little progress is expected in the resolution of E LUC . This is particularly concerning given the growing importance of E LUC for climate mitigation strategies, and the large issues in the quantification of the cumulative emissions over the historical period that arise from large uncertainties in E LUC .Estimates of E LUC suffer from a range of intertwined issues, including the poor quality of historical land-cover and land-use change maps, the rudimentary representation of management processes in most models, and the confusion in methodologies and boundary conditions used across methods (e.g. Arneth et al., 2017;Pongratz et al., 2014; see also Sect. 2.7.4 on the loss of sink capacity; Bastos et al., 2021).

        <p>By adding the DGVM estimates of CO 2 fluxes due to environmental change from countries' managed forest areas (part of S LAND in this budget) to the budget E LUC estimate, we successfully reconciled the large gap between our E LUC estimate and the land-use flux from NGHGIs using the approach described in Grassi et al. (2021). This latter estimate has been used in the recent UNFCCC's Synthesis Report on Nationally Determined Contribution (UNFCCC, 2021b) to enable the total national emission estimates to be comparable with those of the IPCC. However, while Grassi et al. (2021) used only one DGVM, here 17 DGVMs are used, thus providing a more robust value to be used as potential adjustment in the policy context, e.g. to help assessing the collective countries' progress towards the goal of the Paris Agreement and avoiding double-accounting for the sink in managed forests. In the absence of this adjustment, collective progress would hence appear better than it is (Grassi et al., 2021).By adding the DGVM estimates of CO 2 fluxes due to environmental change from countries' managed forest areas (part of S LAND in this budget) to the budget E LUC estimate, we successfully reconciled the large gap between our E LUC estimate and the land-use flux from NGHGIs using the approach described in Grassi et al.

        <p>The comparison of GOBMs, data products, and inversions highlights substantial discrepancy in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 12, Hauck et al., 2020). The long-standing sparse data coverage of f CO 2 observations in the Southern compared to the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. Takahashi et al., 2009) continues to exist (Bakker et al., 2016(Bakker et al., , 2021, Fig. B1) and to lead to substantially higher uncertainty in the S OCEAN estimate for the Southern Hemisphere (Watson et al., 2020;Gloege et al., 2021). This discrepancy, which also hampers model improvement, points to the need for increased high-quality f CO 2 observations, especially in the Southern Ocean. At the same time, model uncertainty is illustrated by the large spread of individual GOBM estimates (indicated by shading in Fig. 12) and highlights the need for model improvement. Further uncertainty stems from the regional distribution of the river flux adjustment term being based on one model study yielding the largest riverine outgassing flux south of 20 • S (Aumont et al., 2001), with a recent study questioning this distribution (Lacroix et al., 2020). The diverging trends in S OCEAN from different methods is a matter of concern, which is unresolved. The assessment of the net land-atmosphere exchange from DGVMs and atmospheric inversions also shows substantial discrepancy, particularly for the estimate of the total land flux over the northern extratropics. This discrepancy highlights the difficulty of quantifying complex processes (CO 2 fertilization, nitrogen deposition and fertilizers, climate change and variability, land management, etc.) that collectively determine the net land CO 2 flux. Resolving the differences in the Northern Hemisphere land sink will require the consideration and inclusion of larger volumes of observations. We provide metrics for the evaluation of the ocean and land models and the atmospheric inversions (Figs. B2 to B4). These metrics expand the use of observations in the global carbon budget, helping (1) to support improvements in the ocean and land carbon models that produce the sink estimates, and (2) to constrain the representation of key underlying processes in the models and to allocate the regional partitioning of the CO 2 fluxes. However, GOBM skills have changed little since the introduction of the ocean model evaluation. An additional simulation this year allows for direct comparison with interior ocean anthropogenic carbon estimates and suggests that the models underestimate anthropogenic carbon uptake and storage. This is an initial step towards the introduction of a broader range of observations that we hope will support continued improvements in the annual estimates of the global carbon budget.The comparison of GOBMs, data products, and inversions highlights substantial discrepancy in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 12, Hauck et al., 2020).

        <p>We assessed before that a sustained decrease of -1 % in global emissions could be detected at the 66 % likelihood level after a decade only (Peters et al., 2017). Similarly, a change in behaviour of the land and/or ocean carbon sink would take as long to detect, and much longer if it emerges more slowly. To continue reducing the carbon imbalance on annual to decadal timescales, regionalizing the carbon budget and integrating multiple variables are powerful ways to shorten the detection limit and ensure the research community can rapidly identify issues of concern in the evolution of the global carbon cycle under the current rapid and unprecedented changing environmental conditions.We assessed before that a sustained decrease of -1 % in global emissions could be detected at the 66 % likelihood level after a decade only (Peters et al., 2017).

        <p>The estimation of global CO 2 emissions and sinks is a major effort by the carbon cycle research community that requires a careful compilation and synthesis of measurements, statistical estimates, and model results. The delivery of an annual carbon budget serves two purposes. First, there is a large demand for up-to-date information on the state of the anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system and its underpinning causes. A broad stakeholder community relies on the datasets associated with the annual carbon budget including scientists, policy makers, businesses, journalists, and non-governmental organizations engaged in adapting to and mitigating human-driven climate change. Second, over the last decades we have seen unprecedented changes in the human and biophysical environments (e.g. changes in the growth of fossil fuel emissions, impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Earth's warming, and strength of the carbon sinks), which call for frequent assessments of the state of the planet, a better quantification of the causes of changes in the contemporary global carbon cycle, and an improved capacity to anticipate its evolution in the future. Building this scientific understanding to meet the extraordinary climate mitigation challenge requires frequent, robust, transparent, and traceable datasets and methods that can be scrutinized and replicated. This paper via "living data" helps to keep track of new budget updates.The estimation of global CO 2 emissions and sinks is a major effort by the carbon cycle research community that requires a careful compilation and synthesis of measurements, statistical estimates, and model results.

        <p>From the moment it is created, cement begins to absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere, a process known as "cement carbonation". We estimate this CO 2 sink, as the average of two studies in the literature (Cao et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2021). Both studies use the same model, developed by Xi et al. (2016), with different parameterizations and input data, with the estimate of Guo and colleagues being a revision of Xi et al. (2016). The trends of the two studies are very similar. Modelling cement carbonation requires estimation of a large number of parameters, including the different types of cement material in different countries, the lifetime of the structures before demolition, of cement waste after demolition, and the volumetric properties of structures, among others (Xi et al., 2016). Lifetime is an important parameter because demolition results in the exposure of new surfaces to the carbonation process. The main reasons for differences between the two studies appear to be the assumed lifetimes of cement structures and the geographic resolution, but the uncertainty bounds of the two studies overlap.

        <p>CDIAC, UNFCCC, and BP national emission statistics "include greenhouse gas emissions and removals taking place within national territory and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction" (Rypdal et al., 2006) and are called territorial emission inventories. Consumption-based emission inventories allocate emissions to products that are consumed within a country and are conceptually calculated as the territorial emissions minus the "embodied" territorial emissions to produce exported products plus the emissions in other countries to produce imported products (consumption = territorial -exports + imports). Consumption-based emission attribution results (e.g. Davis and Caldeira, 2010) provide additional information to territorial-based emissions that can be used to understand emission drivers (Hertwich and Peters, 2009) and quantify emission transfers by the trade of products between countries (Peters et al., 2011b). The consumption-based emissions have the same global total but reflect the trade-driven movement of emissions across the Earth's surface in response to human activities. We estimate consumption-based emissions from 1990-2018 by enumerating the global supply chain using a global model of the economic relationships between economic sectors within and between every country (Andrew and Peters, 2013;Peters et al., 2011a). Our analysis is based on the economic and trade data from the Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP; Narayanan et al., 2015), and we make detailed esti-mates for the years 1997 (GTAP version 5), 2001(GTAP6), 2004, 2007, and 2011 (GTAP9.2), covering 57 sectors and 141 countries and regions. The detailed results are then extended into an annual time series from 1990 to the latest year of the gross domestic product (GDP) data (2018 in this budget), using GDP data by expenditure in the current exchange rate of US dollars (USD; from the UN National Accounts Main Aggregrates Database; UN, 2021) and time series of trade data from GTAP (based on the methodology in Peters et al., 2011a). We estimate the sector-level CO 2 emissions using the GTAP data and methodology, include the flaring and cement emissions from CDIAC, and then scale the national totals (excluding bunker fuels) to match the emission estimates from the carbon budget. We do not provide a separate uncertainty estimate for the consumption-based emissions, but based on model comparisons and sensitivity analysis, they are unlikely to be significantly different than for the territorial emission estimates (Peters et al., 2012a).CDIAC, UNFCCC, and BP national emission statistics "include greenhouse gas emissions and removals taking place within national territory and offshore areas over which the country has jurisdiction" (Rypdal et al., 2006) and are called territorial emission inventories.

        <p>We estimate the uncertainty of the global fossil CO 2 emissions at ±5 % (scaled down from the published ±10 % at ±2σ to the use of ±1σ bounds reported here; Andres et al., 2012). This is consistent with a more detailed analysis of uncertainty of ±8.4 % at ±2σ (Andres et al., 2014) and at the high-end of the range of ±5 %-10 % at ±2σ reported by Ballantyne et al. (2015). This includes an assessment of uncertainties in the amounts of fuel consumed, the carbon and heat contents of fuels, and the combustion efficiency. While we consider a fixed uncertainty of ±5 % for all years, the uncertainty as a percentage of emissions is growing with time because of the larger share of global emissions from emerging economies and developing countries (Marland et al., 2009). Generally, emissions from mature economies with good statistical processes have an uncertainty of only a few per cent (Marland, 2008), while emissions from strongly developing economies such as China have uncertainties of around ±10 % (for ±1σ ; Gregg et al., 2008;Andres et al., 2014). Uncertainties of emissions are likely to be mainly systematic errors related to underlying biases of energy statistics and to the accounting method used by each country.We estimate the uncertainty of the global fossil CO 2 emissions at ±5 % (scaled down from the published ±10 % at ±2σ to the use of ±1σ bounds reported here; Andres et al., 2012). This is consistent with a more detailed analysis of uncertainty of ±8.4 % at ±2σ (Andres et al., 2014) and at the high-end of the range of ±5 %-10 % at ±2σ reported by Ballantyne et al. (2015).

        <p>We report the annual growth rate in emissions for adjacent years (in percent per year) by calculating the difference between the two years and then normalizing to the emissions in the first year: (E FOS (t 0 + 1) -E FOS (t 0 ))/E FOS (t 0 ) ×100 %. We apply a leap-year adjustment where relevant to ensure valid interpretations of annual growth rates. This affects the growth rate by about 0.3 % yr -1 (1/366) and causes calculated growth rates to go up approximately 0.3 % if the first year is a leap year and down 0.3 % if the second year is a leap year.

        <p>To gain insight into emission trends for 2021, we provide an assessment of global fossil CO 2 emissions, E FOS , by combining individual assessments of emissions for China, USA, the EU, and India (the four countries and regions with the largest emissions), and the rest of the world. We provide full year estimates for two datasets: IEA (2021b) and our own analysis. This approach differs from last year where we used four independent estimates including our own, because of the unique circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This year's analysis is more in line with earlier budgets. Previous editions of the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) have estimated year-to-date (YTD) emissions, and performed projections, using sub-annual energy consumption data from a variety of sources depending on the country or region. The YTD estimates have then been projected to the full year using specific methods for each country or region. The methods described in detail below.To gain insight into emission trends for 2021, we provide an assessment of global fossil CO 2 emissions, E FOS , by combining individual assessments of emissions for China, USA, the EU, and India (the four countries and regions with the largest emissions), and the rest of the world.

        <p>We use monthly emissions estimates for India updated from Andrew (2020b) through August 2021. These estimates are derived from many official monthly energy and other activity data sources to produce direct estimates of national CO 2 emissions, without the use of proxies. Emissions from coal are then extended to September using a regression relationship based on power generated from coal, coal dispatches by Coal India Ltd., the composite PMI, time, and days per month. For the last 3-4 months of the year, each series is extrapolated assuming typical trends.We use monthly emissions estimates for India updated from Andrew (2020b) through August 2021.

        <p>We use a refinement to the methods presented by Andrew (2021), deriving emissions from monthly energy data reported by Eurostat. Some data gaps are filled using data from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI, 2022). Sub-annual cement production data are limited, but data for Germany and Poland, the two largest producers, suggest a small decline. For fossil fuels this provides estimates through July. We extend coal emissions through September using a regression model built from generation of power from hard coal, power from brown coal, total power generation, and the number of working days in Germany and Poland, the two biggest coal consumers in the EU. These are then extended through the end of the year assuming typical trends. We extend oil emissions by building a regression model between our monthly CO 2 estimates and oil consumption reported by the EIA for Europe in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (October edition), and then using this model with EIA's monthly forecasts. For natural gas, the strong seasonal signal allows the use of the bias-adjusted Holt-Winters exponential smoothing method (Chatfield, 1978).We use a refinement to the methods presented by Andrew (2021), deriving emissions from monthly energy data reported by Eurostat.

Interannual variability in I FOS is the largest source of uncertainty in the GDP-based emissions projections.

        <p>The global total is the sum of each of the countries and regions. A1). Some of these activities lead to emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere, while others lead to CO 2 sinks. E LUC is the net sum of emissions and removals due to all anthropogenic activities considered. Our annual estimate for 1960-2020 is provided as the average of results from three bookkeeping approaches (Sect. C2.1 below): an estimate using the Bookkeeping of Land Use Emissions model (Hansis et al., 2015; hereafter BLUE) and one using the compact Earth system model OSCAR (Gasser et al., 2020), both BLUE and OSCAR being updated here to new land-use forcing covering the time period until 2020, and an updated version of the estimate published by Houghton and Nassikas (2017) (hereafter updated H&amp;N2017). All three datasets are then extrapolated to provide a projection for 2021 (Sect. C2.5 below). In addition, we use results from dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs; see Sect. 2.5 and Table 4) to help quantify the uncertainty in E LUC (Sect. C2.4), and thus better characterize our understanding. Note that in this budget, we use the scientific E LUC definition, which counts fluxes due to environmental changes on managed land towards S LAND , as opposed to the national greenhouse gas inventories under the UNFCCC, which include them in E LUC and thus often report smaller land-use emissions (Grassi et al., 2018;Petrescu et al., 2020).

        <p>Land-use change CO 2 emissions and uptake fluxes are calculated by three bookkeeping models. These are based on the original bookkeeping approach of Houghton (2003) that keeps track of the carbon stored in vegetation and soils before and after a land-use change (transitions between various natural vegetation types, croplands, and pastures). Literaturebased response curves describe decay of vegetation and soil carbon, including transfer to product pools of different lifetimes, as well as carbon uptake due to regrowth. In addition, the bookkeeping models represent long-term degradation of primary forest as lowered standing vegetation and soil carbon stocks in secondary forests and include forest management practices such as wood harvests. BLUE and the updated H&amp;N2017 exclude land ecosystems' transient response to changes in climate, atmospheric CO 2 , and other environmental factors and base the carbon densities on contemporary data from literature and inventory data. Since carbon densities thus remain fixed over time, the additional sink capacity that ecosystems provide in response to CO 2 fertilization and some other environmental changes is not captured by these models (Pongratz et al., 2014). On the contrary, OSCAR includes this transient response, and it follows a theoretical framework (Gasser and Ciais, 2013) that allows the separation of bookkeeping landuse emissions and the loss of additional sink capacity. Only the former is included here, while the latter is discussed in Appendix D4. The bookkeeping models differ in (1) computational units (spatially explicit treatment of land-use change for BLUE, regional-or mostly country-level for the updated H&amp;N2017 and OSCAR), (2) processes represented (see Table A1), and (3) carbon densities assigned to vegetation and soil of each vegetation type (literature-based for the updated H&amp;N2017 and BLUE, calibrated to DGVMs for OSCAR). A notable difference between models exists with respect to the treatment of shifting cultivation. The update of H&amp;N2017 changed the approach over the earlier H&amp;N2017 version: H&amp;N2017 had assumed the "excess loss" of tropical forests (i.e. when FRA indicated a forest loss larger than the increase in agricultural areas from FAO) resulted from converting forests to croplands at the same time older croplands were abandoned. Those abandoned croplands began to recover to forests after 15 years. The updated H&amp;N2017 now assumes that forest loss in excess of increases in cropland and pastures represented an increase in shifting cultivation. When the excess loss of forests was negative, it was assumed that shifting cultivation was returned to forest. Historical areas in shifting cultivation were extrapolated taking into account country-based estimates of areas lying fallow in 1980 (FAO/UNEP, 1981) and expert opinion (from Heinimann et al., 2017). In contrast, the BLUE and OSCAR models include sub-grid-scale transitions between all vegetation types. Furthermore, the updated H&amp;N2017 assume conversion of natural grasslands to pasture, while BLUE and OS-CAR allocate pasture proportionally on all natural vegetation that exists in a grid cell. This is one reason for generally higher emissions in BLUE and OSCAR. Bookkeeping models do not directly capture carbon emissions from peat fires, which can create large emissions and interannual variability due to synergies of land-use and climate variability in Southeast Asia, particularly during El-Niño events, nor emissions from the organic layers of drained peat soils. To correct for this, the updated H&amp;N2017 includes carbon emissions from burning and draining of peatlands in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea (based on the Global Fire Emission Database, GFED4s; van der Werf et al., 2017, for fire andHooijer et al., 2010, for drainage). Further, estimates of carbon losses from peatlands in extra-tropical regions are added from Qiu et al. (2021). We add GFED4s peat fire emissions to BLUE and OSCAR output as well as the global FAO peat drainage emissions 1990-2018 from croplands and grasslands (Conchedda and Tubiello, 2020), keeping post-2018 emissions constant. We linearly increase tropical drainage emissions from 0 in 1980, consistent with H&amp;N2017's assumption, and keep emissions from the often old drained areas of the extra-tropics constant pre-1990. This adds 9.0 GtC for FAO compared to 5.6 GtC for Hooijer et al. (2010). Peat fires add another 2.0 GtC over the same period.Land-use change CO 2 emissions and uptake fluxes are calculated by three bookkeeping models.

        <p>The three bookkeeping estimates used in this study differ with respect to the land-use change data used to drive the models. The updated H&amp;N2017 base their estimates directly on the Forest Resource Assessment of the FAO which provides statistics on forest-area change and management at intervals of 5 years currently updated until 2020 (FAO, 2020). The data are based on country reporting to FAO and may include remote-sensing information in more recent assessments. Changes in land use other than forests are based on annual, national changes in cropland and pasture areas reported by FAO (FAOSTAT, 2021). On the other hand, BLUE uses the harmonized land-use change data LUH2-GCB2021 covering the entire 850-2020 period (an update to the previously released LUH2 v2h dataset; Hurtt et al., 2017Hurtt et al., , 2020)), which was also used as input to the DGVMs (Sect. C2.2). It describes land-use change, also based on the FAO data as described in Sect. C2.2 as well as the HYDE3.3 dataset (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017a, b), but provided at a quarterdegree spatial resolution, considering sub-grid-scale transitions between primary forest, secondary forest, primary nonforest, secondary non-forest, cropland, pasture, rangeland, and urban land (Hurtt et al., 2020;Chini et al., 2021). LUH2-GCB2021 provides a distinction between rangelands and pasture, based on inputs from HYDE. To constrain the models' interpretation on whether rangeland implies the original natural vegetation to be transformed to grassland or not (e.g. browsing on shrubland), a forest mask was provided with LUH2-GCB2021; forest is assumed to be transformed to grasslands, while other natural vegetation remains (in case of secondary vegetation) or is degraded from primary to secondary vegetation (Ma et al., 2020). This is implemented in BLUE. OSCAR was run with both LUH2-GCB2021 and FAO/FRA (as used by Houghton and Nassikas, 2017), where emissions from the latter were extended beyond 2015 with constant 2011-2015 average values. The best-guess OSCAR estimate used in our study is a combination of results for LUH2-GCB2021 and FAO/FRA land-use data and a large number of perturbed parameter simulations weighted against an observational constraint. All three bookkeeping estimates were extended from 2020 to provide a projection for 2021 by adding the annual change in emissions from tropical deforestation and degradation and peat burning and drainage to the respective model's estimate for 2020 (van der Werf et al., 2017;Conchedda and Tubiello, 2020).The three bookkeeping estimates used in this study differ with respect to the land-use change data used to drive the models.

Gross removals stem from regrowth after agricultural abandonment and wood harvesting.

        <p>Due to an artefact in the HYDE3.3 dataset expressed as an abrupt shift in the pattern of pastures and rangelands in 1960, the year 1960 exhibits much larger gross transitions between natural vegetation and pastures and rangelands than prior and subsequent years. Although these gross transitions cancel out in terms of net area changes causing large abrupt transitions, an unrealistic peak in emissions occurs around 1960 in BLUE and OSCAR. To correct for this, we replace the estimates for 1959-1961 by the average of 1958 and 1962 in both BLUE and OSCAR. Abrupt transitions will immediately influence gross emissions, which have a larger instantaneous component. Processes with longer timescales, such as slow legacy emissions and regrowth, are inseparable from the carbon dynamics due to subsequent land-use change events. We therefore do not adjust gross removals, but only gross emissions to match the corrected net flux. Since DGVM estimates are only used for an uncertainty range of E LUC , which is independent of land-use changes, no correction is applied to the DGVM data.Due to an artefact in the HYDE3.3 dataset expressed as an abrupt shift in the pattern of pastures and rangelands in 1960, the year 1960 exhibits much larger gross transitions between natural vegetation and pastures and rangelands than prior and subsequent years.

        <p>Land-use change CO 2 emissions have also been estimated using an ensemble of 17 DGVM simulations. The DGVMs account for deforestation and regrowth, the most important components of E LUC , but they do not represent all processes resulting directly from human activities on land (Table A1). All DGVMs represent processes of vegetation growth and mortality, as well as decomposition of dead organic matter associated with natural cycles, and include the vegetation and soil carbon response to increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration and to climate variability and change. Most models explicitly simulate the coupling of carbon and nitrogen cycles and account for atmospheric N deposition and N fertilizers (Table A1). The DGVMs are independent from the other budget terms except for their use of atmospheric CO 2 concentration to calculate the fertilization effect of CO 2 on plant photosynthesis.Land-use change CO 2 emissions have also been estimated using an ensemble of 17 DGVM simulations.

        <p>DGVMs that do not simulate sub-grid-scale transitions (i.e. net land-use emissions; see Table A1) used the HYDE land-use change dataset (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017a, b), which provides annual (1700-2019), half-degree, fractional data on cropland and pasture. The data are based on the available annual FAO statistics of change in agricultural land area available until 2015. The new HYDE3.3 cropland and grazing land dataset which now in addition to having FAO country-level statistics is constrained spatially based on multi-year satellite land-cover maps from ESA CCI LC. Data from HYDE3.3 are based on a FAO which includes yearly data from 1961 up to and including the year 2017. After the year 2017 HYDE extrapolates the cropland, pasture, and urban data linearly based on the trend over the previous 5 years, to generate data until the year 2020. HYDE also uses satellite imagery from ESA-CCI from 1992-2018 for more detailed yearly allocation of cropland and grazing land, with the ESA area data scaled to match the FAO annual totals at country level. The 2018 map is also used for the 2019-2020 period. The original 300 m resolution data from ESA were aggregated to a 5 arcmin resolution according to the classification scheme as described in Klein Goldewijk et al. (2017a). DGVMs that simulate sub-grid-scale transitions (i.e. gross land-use emissions; see Table A1) also use the LUH2-GCB2021 dataset, an update of the more comprehensive harmonized land-use dataset (Hurtt et al., 2020), that further includes fractional data on primary and secondary forest vegetation, as well as all underlying transitions between land-use states (850-2020;Hurtt et al., 2011Hurtt et al., , 2017Hurtt et al., , 2020;;Chini et al., 2021;Table A1). This new dataset is of quarter-degree fractional areas of land-use states and all transitions between those states, including a new wood harvest reconstruction and new representation of shifting cultivation, crop rotations, and management information including irrigation and fertilizer application. The land-use states include five different crop types in addition to the pasture-rangeland split discussed before. Wood harvest patterns are constrained with Landsat-based tree cover loss data (Hansen et al., 2013). Updates of LUH2-GCB2021 over last year's version (LUH2-GCB2020) are using the most recent HYDE/FAO release (covering the time period up to 2021 included). We also use the most recent FAO wood harvest data for all years from 1961 to 2019. After the year 2019 we extrapolated the wood harvest data until the year 2020. The HYDE3.3 population data are also used to extend the wood harvest time series back in time. Other wood harvest inputs (for years prior to 1961) remain the same in LUH2. With the switch from HYDE3.2 to HYDE3.3 changes in the land-use forcing compared to the version used in the GCB2020 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020) are pronounced. They are thus compared in Fig. 6b and their relevance for land-use emissions discussed in Sect. 3.4.2. DGVMs implement land-use change differently (e.g. an increased cropland fraction in a grid cell can either be at the expense of grassland or shrubs, or forest, the latter resulting in deforestation; land-cover fractions of the non-agricultural land differ between models). Similarly, model-specific assumptions are applied to convert deforested biomass or deforested area, and other forest product pools into carbon, and different choices are made regarding the allocation of rangelands as natural vegetation or pastures.DGVMs that do not simulate sub-grid-scale transitions (i.e. net land-use emissions; see Table A1) used the HYDE land-use change dataset (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017a, b), which provides annual (1700-2019), half-degree, fractional data on cropland and pasture.

        <p>The difference between two DGVM simulations (see Sect. C4.1 below), one forced with historical changes in land-use and a second with time-invariant pre-industrial land cover and pre-industrial wood harvest rates, allows quantification of the dynamic evolution of vegetation biomass and soil carbon pools in response to land-use change in each model (E LUC ). Using the difference between these two DGVM simulations to diagnose E LUC means the DGVMs account for the loss of additional sink capacity (around 0.4 ± 0.3 GtC yr -1 ; see Sect. 2.7.4, Appendix D4), while the bookkeeping models do not.The difference between two DGVM simulations (see Sect.

All DGVMs met this criterion, although one model was not included in the E LUC estimate from DGVMs as it exhibited a spurious response to the transient land-cover change forcing after its initial spin-up.As a criterion for inclusion in this carbon budget, we only retain models that simulate a positive E LUC during the 1990s, as assessed in the IPCC AR4 (Denman et al., 2007) and AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013).

        <p>An approach was implemented to reconcile the large gap between E LUC from bookkeeping models and land use, landuse change, and forestry (LULUCF) from national GHG inventories (NGHGIs) (see Table A8). This gap is due to different approaches to calculating "anthropogenic" CO 2 fluxes related to land-use change and land management (Grassi et al., 2018). In particular, the land sinks due to environmental change on managed lands are treated as non-anthropogenic in the global carbon budget, while they are generally considered as anthropogenic in NGHGIs ("indirect anthropogenic fluxes"; Eggleston et al., 2006). Building on previous studies (Grassi et al., 2021), the approach implemented here adds the DGVM estimates of CO 2 fluxes due to environmental change from countries' managed forest area (part of the S LAND ) to the original E LUC flux. This sum is expected to be conceptually more comparable to LULUCF than simply E LUC .An approach was implemented to reconcile the large gap between E LUC from bookkeeping models and land use, landuse change, and forestry (LULUCF) from national GHG inventories (NGHGIs) (see Table A8).

        <p>E LUC data are taken from bookkeeping models, in line with the global carbon budget approach. To determine S LAND on managed forest, the following steps were taken: Spatially gridded data of "natural" forest NBP (net biome productivity) (S LAND , i.e. due to environmental change and excluding land-use change fluxes) were obtained with S2 runs from DGVMs up to 2019 from the TRENDY v9 dataset. Results were first masked with the Hansen forest map (Hansen et al., 2013), with a 20 % tree cover and following the FAO definition of forest (isolated pixels with maximum connectivity less than 0.5 ha are excluded), and then further masked with the "intact" forest map for the year 2013, i.e. forest areas characterized by no remotely detected signs of human activity (Potapov et al., 2017). This way, we obtained the S LAND in "intact" and "non-intact" forest area, which previous studies (Grassi et al., 2021) indicated to be a good proxy, respectively, for "unmanaged" and "managed" forest area in the NGHGI. Note that only four models (CABLE-POP, CLAS-SIC, YIBs and ORCHIDEE-CNP) had forest NBP at grid cell level. Two models (OCN and ISBA-CTRIP) provided forest NEP and simulated disturbances at pixel level that were used as basis, in addition to forest cover fraction, to estimate forest NBP. For the other DGVMs, when a grid cell had forest, all the NBP was allocated to forest.E LUC data are taken from bookkeeping models, in line with the global carbon budget approach.

        <p>LULUCF data from NGHGIs are from Grassi et al. (2021) until 2017, updated until 2019 for UNFCCC Annex I countries. For non-Annex I countries, the years 2018 and 2019 were assumed to be equal to the average 2013-2017. These data include all CO 2 fluxes from land considered managed, which in principle encompasses all land uses (forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and other land), changes among them, and emissions from organic soils and from fires. In practice, although almost all Annex I countries report all land uses, many non-Annex I countries report only on deforestation and forest land, and few countries report on other land uses. In most cases, NGHGIs include most of the natural response to recent environmental change, because they use direct observations (e.g. national forest inventories) that do not allow the separation of direct and indirect anthropogenic effects (Eggleston et al., 2006).LULUCF data from NGHGIs are from Grassi et al.

        <p>To provide additional, largely independent assessments of fluxes on unmanaged vs. managed lands, we include a DGVM that allows diagnosis of fluxes from unmanaged vs. managed lands by tracking vegetation cohorts of different ages separately. This model, 
            <rs type="software">ORCHIDEE-MICT</rs> (Yue et al., 2018), was run using the same LUH2 forcing as the DGVMs used in this budget (Sect. 2.5) and the bookkeeping models BLUE and OSCAR (Sect. 2.2). Old-aged forest was classified as primary forest after a certain threshold of carbon density was reached again, and the model-internal distinction be-tween primary and secondary forest used as proxies for unmanaged vs. managed forests; agricultural lands are added to the latter to arrive at total managed land.
        </p>
        <p>Table A8 shows the resulting mapping of global carbon cycle models' land flux definitions to that of the NGHGI (discussed in Sect. 3.2.2). ORCHIDEE-MICT estimates for S LAND on intact forests are expected to be higher than those based on DGVMs in combination with the NGHGI managed and unmanaged forest data because the unmanaged forest area, with about 27 mio km 2 , is estimated to be substantially larger by 
            <rs type="software">ORCHIDEE-MICT</rs> than that, with less than 10 mio km 2 , by the NGHGI, while managed forest area is estimated to be smaller (22 compared to 32 mio km 2 ). Related to this, S LAND on non-intact lands plus E LUC is a larger source estimated by 
            <rs type="software">ORCHIDEE-MICT</rs> compared to the NGHGI. We also show as comparison FAOSTAT emissions totals (FAO, 2021), which include emissions from net forest conversion and fluxes on forest land (Tubiello et al., 2021) as well as CO 2 emissions from peat drainage and peat fires.

        <p>Differences between the bookkeeping models and DGVMs originate from three main sources: the different methodologies, which among others lead to inclusion of the loss of additional sink capacity in DGVMs (see Appendix D1.4), the underlying land-use/land-cover dataset, and the different processes represented (Table A1). We examine the results from the DGVMs and of the bookkeeping method and use the resulting variations as a way to characterize the uncertainty in E LUC .Differences between the bookkeeping models and DGVMs originate from three main sources: the different methodologies, which among others lead to inclusion of the loss of additional sink capacity in DGVMs (see Appendix D1.4), the underlying land-use/land-cover dataset, and the different processes represented (Table A1).

        <p>Despite these differences, the E LUC estimate from the DGVMs multi-model mean is consistent with the average of the emissions from the bookkeeping models (Table 5). However, there are large differences among individual DGVMs (standard deviation at around 0.5 GtC yr -1 ; Table 5), between the bookkeeping estimates (average difference 1850-2020 BLUE-updated H&amp;N2017 of 0.8 GtC yr -1 , BLUE-OSCAR of 0.4 GtC yr -1 , OSCAR-updated H&amp;N2017 of 0.3 GtC yr -1 ), and between the updated estimate of H&amp;N2017 and its previous model version (Houghton et al., 2012). A factorial analysis of differences between BLUE and H&amp;N2017 attributed them particularly to differences in carbon densities between natural and managed vegetation or primary and secondary vegetation (Bastos et al., 2021).

Prior to the year 1959, the uncertainty in E LUC was taken from the standard deviation of the DGVMs. We assign low confidence to the annual estimates of E LUC because of the inconsistencies among estimates and of the difficulties of quantifying some of the processes in DGVMs.The uncertainty in E LUC of ±0.7 GtC yr -1 reflects our best value judgement that there is at least 68 % chance (±1σ ) that the true land-use change emission lies within the given range, for the range of processes considered here.

        <p>We primarily use the observational constraints assessed by IPCC of a mean ocean CO 2 sink of 2.2 ± 0.7 GtC yr -1 for the 1990s (90 % confidence interval; Ciais et al., 2013) to verify that the GOBMs provide a realistic assessment of S OCEAN . This is based on indirect observations with seven different methodologies and their uncertainties, using the methods that are deemed most reliable for the assessment of this quantity (Denman et al., 2007;Ciais et al., 2013). The observation-based estimates use the ocean-land CO 2 sink partitioning from observed atmospheric CO 2 and O 2 / N 2 concentration trends (Manning and Keeling, 2006;Keeling and Manning, 2014), an oceanic inversion method constrained by ocean biogeochemistry data (Mikaloff Fletcher et al., 2006), and a method based on penetration timescale for chlorofluorocarbons (McNeil et al., 2003).

These estimates differ in many respects: they use different maps of surface f CO 2 , different atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, wind products and different gas-exchange formulations as specified in Table A3. We refer to them as f CO 2 -based flux estimates. The measurements underlying the surface f CO 2 maps are from the Surface Ocean CO 2 Atlas version 2021 (SOCATv2021; Bakker et al., 2021), which is an update of version 3 (Bakker et al., 2016) and contains quality-controlled data through 2020 (see data attribution Table A5). Each of the estimates uses a different method to then map the SOCAT v2021 data to the global ocean. The methods include a data-driven diagnostic method (Rödenbeck et al., 2013; referred to here as Jena-MLS), three neural network models (Landschützer et al., 2014; referred to as MPI-SOMFFN; Chau et al., 2022; Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, referred to here as CMEMS-LSCE-FFNN; and Zeng et al., 2014; referred to as NIES-FNN), two cluster regression approaches (Gregor et al., 2019; referred to here as CSIR-ML6; and Gregor and Gruber, 2021, referred to as OS-ETHZ-GRaCER), and a multi-linear regression method (Iida et al., 2021; referred to as JMA-MLR). The ensemble mean of the f CO 2 -based flux estimates is calculated from these seven mapping methods. Further, we show the flux estimate of Watson et al. (2020), who also use the MPI-SOMFFN method to map the adjusted f CO 2 data to the globe, but resulting in a substantially larger ocean sink estimate, owing to a number of adjustments they applied to the surface ocean f CO 2 data and the gas-exchange parameterization. Concretely, these authors adjusted the SO-CAT f CO 2 downward to account for differences in temperature between the depth of the ship intake and the relevant depth right near the surface and included a further adjustment to account for the cool surface skin temperature effect. The Watson et al. flux estimate hence differs from the others by their choice of adjusting the flux to a cool, salty ocean surface skin. Watson et al. (2020) showed that this temperature adjustment leads to an upward correction of the ocean carbon sink, up to 0.9 GtC yr -1 , that, if correct, should be applied to all f CO 2 -based flux estimates. So far, this adjustment is based on a single line of evidence and hence associated with low confidence until further evidence is available. The Watson et al. flux estimate presented here is therefore not included in the ensemble mean of the f CO 2 -based flux estimates. This choice will be re-evaluated in upcoming budgets based on further lines of evidence.We also use eight estimates of the ocean CO 2 sink and its variability based on surface ocean f CO 2 maps obtained by the interpolation of surface ocean f CO 2 measurements from 1990 onwards due to severe restriction in data availability prior to 1990 (Fig. 9).

In products where the covered area varies with time (e.g. CMEMS-LSCE-FFNN) we use the maximum area coverage.

The uncertainty in cumulative uptake of ±20 GtC (converted to ± 1σ ) is taken directly from the IPCC's review of the literature (Rhein et al., 2013), or about ±30 % for the annual values (Khatiwala et al., 2009).We further use results from two diagnostic ocean models, Khatiwala et al.

        <p>The ocean CO 2 sink for 1959-2019 is estimated using eight GOBMs (Table A2). The GOBMs represent the physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence the surface ocean concentration of CO 2 and thus the air-sea CO 2 flux. The GOBMs are forced by meteorological reanalysis and atmospheric CO 2 concentration data available for the entire time period. They mostly differ in the source of the atmospheric forcing data (meteorological reanalysis), spinup strategies, and in their horizontal and vertical resolutions (Table A2). All GOBMs except one (CESM-ETHZ) do not include the effects of anthropogenic changes in nutrient supply (Duce et al., 2008). They also do not include the perturbation associated with changes in riverine organic carbon (see Sect. 2.7.3).The ocean CO 2 sink for 1959-2019 is estimated using eight GOBMs (Table A2).

        <p>Three sets of simulations were performed with each of the GOBMs. Simulation A applied historical changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Simulation B is a control simulation with constant atmospheric forcing (normalyear or repeated-year forcing) and constant pre-industrial atmospheric CO 2 concentration. Simulation C is forced with historical changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentration, but repeated year or normal-year atmospheric climate forcing. To derive S OCEAN from the model simulations, we subtracted the annual time series of the control simulation B from the annual time series of simulation A. Assuming that drift and bias are the same in simulations A and B, we thereby correct for any model drift. Further, this difference also removes the natural steady-state flux (assumed to be 0 GtC yr -1 globally without rivers) which is often a major source of biases. Simulation B of IPSL had to be treated differently as it was forced with constant atmospheric CO 2 but observed historical changes in climate. For IPSL, we fitted a linear trend to the simulation B and subtracted this linear trend from simulation A. This approach assures that the interannual variability is not removed from IPSL simulation A.Three sets of simulations were performed with each of the GOBMs. Simulation A applied historical changes in climate and atmospheric CO 2 concentration.

        <p>The absolute correction for bias and drift per model in the 1990s varied between &lt; 0.01 and 0.26 GtC yr -1 , with six models having positive biases, and one model having essentially no bias (NorESM). The remaining model (MPI) uses riverine input and therefore simulates outgassing in simulation B, i.e. a seemingly negative bias. By subtracting simulation B, the ocean carbon sink of the MPI model also follows the definition of S OCEAN . This correction reduces the model mean ocean carbon sink by 0.03 GtC yr -1 in the 1990s. The ocean models cover 99 % to 101 % of the total ocean area, so that area scaling is not necessary.The absolute correction for bias and drift per model in the 1990s varied between &lt; 0.01 and 0.26 GtC yr -1 , with six models having positive biases, and one model having essentially no bias (NorESM).

        <p>The ocean CO 2 sink for all GOBMs and the ensemble mean falls within 90 % confidence of the observed range, or 1.5 to 2.9 GtC yr -1 for the 1990s (Ciais et al., 2013) after applying adjustments. An exception is the MPI model, which simulates a low ocean carbon sink of 1.38 GtC yr -1 for the 1990s in simulation A owing to the inclusion of riverine carbon flux. After adjusting to the GCB's definition of S OCEAN by subtracting simulation B, the MPI model falls into the observed range with an estimated sink of 1.69 GtC yr -1 . The GOBMs and data products have been further evaluated using the fugacity of sea surface CO 2 (f CO 2 ) from the SOCAT v2021 database (Bakker et al., 2016(Bakker et al., , 2021)). We focused this evaluation on the root mean squared error (RMSE) between observed and modelled f CO 2 and on a measure of the amplitude of the interannual variability of the flux (modified after Rödenbeck et al., 2015). The RMSE is calculated from detrended annually and regionally averaged time series calculated from GOBMs and data product f CO 2 subsampled to open ocean (water depth &gt; 400 m) SOCAT sampling points to measure the misfit between large-scale signals (Hauck et al., 2020) The amplitude of the S OCEAN interannual variability (A-IAV) is calculated as the temporal standard deviation of the detrended CO 2 flux time series (Rödenbeck et al., 2015;Hauck et al., 2020). These metrics are chosen because RMSE is the most direct measure of data-model mismatch and the A-IAV is a direct measure of the variability of S OCEAN on interannual timescales. We apply these metrics globally and by latitude bands.

        <p>We quantify the 1σ uncertainty around the mean ocean sink of anthropogenic CO 2 by assessing random and systematic uncertainties for the GOBMs and data products. The random uncertainties are taken from the ensemble standard deviation (0.3 GtC yr -1 for GOBMs, 0.3 GtC yr -1 for data products). We derive the GOBMs' systematic uncertainty by the deviation of the DIC inventory change 1994-2007 from the Gruber et al. ( 2019) estimate (0.5 GtC yr -1 ) and suggest these are related to physical transport (mixing, advection) into the ocean interior. For the data products, we consider systematic uncertainties stemming from uncertainty in f CO 2 observations (0.2 GtC yr -1 , Takahashi et al., 2009;Wanninkhof et al., 2013), gas-transfer velocity (0.2 GtC yr -1 , Ho et al., 2011;Wanninkhof et al., 2013;Roobaert et al., 2018), wind product (0.1 GtC yr -1 , Fay et al., 2021), river flux adjustment (0.2 GtC yr -1 , Jacobson et al., 2007;Resplandy et al., 2018), and f CO 2 mapping (0.2 GtC yr -1 , Landschützer et al., 2014). Com-bining these uncertainties as their squared sums, we assign an uncertainty of ±0.6 GtC yr -1 to the GOBMs ensemble mean and an uncertainty of ±0.5 GtC yr -1 to the dataproduct ensemble mean. These uncertainties are propagated as σ (S OCEAN ) = (1/2 2 ×0.6 2 +1/2 2 ×0.5 2 ) 1/2 GtC yr -1 and result in an ±0.4 GtC yr -1 uncertainty around the best estimate of S OCEAN .We quantify the 1σ uncertainty around the mean ocean sink of anthropogenic CO 2 by assessing random and systematic uncertainties for the GOBMs and data products.

        <p>The inversion systems prescribe same global fossil fuel emissions for E FOS , specifically the GCP's Gridded Fossil Emissions Dataset version 2021 (GCP-GridFEDv2021.2; Jones et al., 2021b), which is an update through 2020 of the first version of GCP-GridFED presented by Jones et al.

Typically, the GCP-GridFED adopts the seasonal variation in emissions (the monthly distribution of annual emissions) from EDGAR and applies small corrections based on heating or cooling degree days to account for the effects of inter-annual climate variability on the seasonality emissions (Jones et al., 2021a). However, strategies taken to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 mean that the seasonality of emissions diverged substantially in 2020 from a typical year.

To account for small differences in regridding, and the use of a slightly earlier file version (GCP-GridFEDv2021.1) for 2000-2018 in CarbonTracker Europe, small fossil fuel corrections were applied to all inverse models to make the estimated uptake of atmospheric CO 2 fully consistent.

        <p>The land and ocean CO 2 fluxes from atmospheric inversions contain anthropogenic perturbation and natural preindustrial CO 2 fluxes. On annual timescales, natural preindustrial fluxes are primarily land CO 2 sinks and ocean CO 2 sources corresponding to carbon taken up on land, transported by rivers from land to ocean, and outgassed by the ocean. These pre-industrial land CO 2 sinks are thus compensated over the globe by ocean CO 2 sources corresponding to the outgassing of riverine carbon inputs to the ocean, us-ing the exact same numbers and distribution as described for the oceans in Sect. 2.4. To facilitate the comparison, we adjusted the inverse estimates of the land and ocean fluxes per latitude band with these numbers to produce historical perturbation CO 2 fluxes from inversions. Finally, for the presentation of the comparison in Fig. 11 we modified the fossilfuel-corrected and riverine-adjusted land sinks from the inversions further, by removing a 0.2 GtC yr -1 CO 2 sink that is ascribed to cement carbonation in the GCB, rather than to terrestrial ecosystems. The latter is not applied in the inversion products released through GCB or the original data portals of these products.The land and ocean CO 2 fluxes from atmospheric inversions contain anthropogenic perturbation and natural preindustrial CO 2 fluxes.

        <p>All participating atmospheric inversions are checked for consistency with the annual global growth rate, as both are derived from the global surface network of atmospheric CO 2 observations. In this exercise, we use the conversion factor of 2.086 GtC ppm -1 to convert the inverted carbon fluxes to mole fractions, as suggested by Prather (2012). This number is specifically suited for the comparison to surface observations that do not respond uniformly, nor immediately, to each year's summed sources and sinks. This factor is therefore slightly smaller than the GCB conversion factor in Table 1 (2.142 GtC ppm -1 , Ballantyne et al., 2012). Overall, the inversions agree with the growth rate with biases between 0.03-0.08 ppm (0.06-0.17 GtC yr -1 ) on the decadal average.All participating atmospheric inversions are checked for consistency with the annual global growth rate, as both are derived from the global surface network of atmospheric CO 2 observations.

        <p>In our estimate of E FOS we assumed (Sect. 2.1.1) that all the fuel burned is emitted as CO 2 , thus CO anthropogenic emissions associated with incomplete fossil fuel combustion and its atmospheric oxidation into CO 2 within a few months are already counted implicitly in E FOS and should not be counted twice (same for E LUC and anthropogenic CO emissions by deforestation fires). Anthropogenic emissions of fossil CH 4 are, however, not included in E FOS , because these fugitive emissions are not included in the fuel inventories. Yet they contribute to the annual CO 2 growth rate after CH 4 gets oxidized into CO 2 . Emissions of fossil CH 4 represent 30 % of total anthropogenic CH 4 emissions (Saunois et al., 2020; their top-down estimate is used because it is consistent with the observed CH 4 growth rate), that is 0.083 GtC yr -1 for the decade 2008-2017. Assuming steady state, an amount equal to this fossil CH 4 emission is all converted to CO 2 by OH oxidation, thus explaining 0.083 GtC yr -1 of the global CO 2 growth rate with an uncertainty range of 0.061 to 0.098 GtC yr -1 taken from the min-max of top-down estimates in Saunois et al. (2020). If this min-max range is assumed to be 2σ because Saunois et al.

        <p>The approach used to determine the global carbon budget refers to the mean, variations, and trends in the perturbation of CO 2 in the atmosphere, referenced to the pre-industrial era. Carbon is continuously displaced from the land to the ocean through the land-ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC) comprising freshwaters, estuaries, and coastal areas (Bauer et al., 2013;Regnier et al., 2013). A substantial fraction of this lateral carbon flux is entirely "natural" and is thus a steadystate component of the pre-industrial carbon cycle. We account for this pre-industrial flux where appropriate in our study (see Appendix C3). However, changes in environmental conditions and land-use change have caused an increase in the lateral transport of carbon into the LOAC -a perturbation that is relevant for the global carbon budget presented here.The approach used to determine the global carbon budget refers to the mean, variations, and trends in the perturbation of CO 2 in the atmosphere, referenced to the pre-industrial era.

        <p>The results of the analysis of Regnier et al. (2013) can be summarized in two points of relevance for the anthropogenic CO 2 budget. First, the anthropogenic perturbation of the LOAC has increased the organic carbon export from terrestrial ecosystems to the hydrosphere by as much as 1.0 ±0.5 GtC yr -1 since pre-industrial times, mainly owing to enhanced carbon export from soils. Second, this exported anthropogenic carbon is partly respired through the LOAC, partly sequestered in sediments along the LOAC, and to a lesser extent transferred to the open ocean where it may accumulate or be outgassed. The increase in storage of land-derived organic carbon in the LOAC carbon reservoirs (burial) and in the open ocean combined is estimated by Regnier et al. (2013) at 0.65 ± 0.35 GtC yr -1 . The inclusion of LOAC-related anthropogenic CO 2 fluxes should affect estimates of S LAND and S OCEAN in Eq. (1) but does not affect the other terms. Representation of the anthropogenic perturbation of LOAC CO 2 fluxes is, however, not included in the GOBMs and DGVMs used in our global carbon budget analysis presented here.The results of the analysis of Regnier et al.

        <p>Historical land-cover change was dominated by transitions from vegetation types that can provide a large carbon sink per area unit (typically, forests) to others less efficient in removing CO 2 from the atmosphere (typically, croplands). The resultant decrease in land sink, called the "loss of additional sink capacity", can be calculated as the difference between the actual land sink under changing land cover and the counterfactual land sink under pre-industrial land cover. This term is not accounted for in our global carbon budget estimate. Here, we provide a quantitative estimate of this term to be used in the discussion. Seven of the DGVMs used in Friedlingstein et al. (2019) performed additional simulations with and without land-use change under cycled pre-industrial environmental conditions. The resulting loss of additional sink capacity amounts to 0.9 ± 0.3 GtC yr -1 on average over 2009-2018and 42 ± 16 GtC accumulated between 1850and 2018(Obermeier et al., 2021). OSCAR, emulating the behaviour of 11 DGVMs, finds values of the loss of additional sink capacity of 0.7 ± 0.6 GtC yr -1 and 31 ± 23 GtC for the same time period (Gasser et al., 2020). Since the DGVMbased E LUC estimates are only used to quantify the uncertainty around the bookkeeping models' E LUC , we do not add the loss of additional sink capacity to the bookkeeping estimate.Historical land-cover change was dominated by transitions from vegetation types that can provide a large carbon sink per area unit (typically, forests) to others less efficient in removing CO 2 from the atmosphere (typically, croplands).
