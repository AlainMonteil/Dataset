        <p>Mountainous regions are inherently susceptible to geohazards, such as landslides and debris flows, with the threat of natural disasters compounded by human activities (mainly settlements). Lessons learned from past events that involved the interactions between human activities and geohazards are helpful for future site selections of human settlements in mountainous regions. To this end, the events associated with county seat relocations in Badong, a typical county in the Three Gorges Reservoir region, China, are studied from an engineering geologist's perspective. Over its history, the county seat was relocated multiple times, with the first relocation traced back to the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE) and the last two relocations linked to the Three Gorges Dam project. By studying geohazards and their interactions with human activities in these county-seat relocations, and through the reconstruction of these events, we secure insights into decision-making for these events. As part of the reconstruction of these relocation events, we analyze a giant pre-historic landslide, whose discovery ultimately prompted the third relocation. Using the case history of this landslide, we also discuss and emphasize the importance of proactive monitoring of geohazards for disaster resilience enhancement, recognizing that our knowledge of nature is vastly incomplete.</p>
        <p>Geohazards such as landslides and debris flows occur throughout much of the world and often lead to a loss of life and property (Aleotti and Chowdhury, 1999;Dai et al., 2002;Petley, 2012;Iverson et al., 2015). The impact of geohazards is particularly harsh when they are concurrent or closely associated with other disastrous events such as flooding. Terms like a cascade of hazards or consecutive disasters are used in the literature to emphasize the importance of anticipating such linked events for timely risk management and mitigation (Gill and Malamud, 2016;AghaKouchak et al., 2018;Pescaroli et al., 2018;de Ruiter et al., 2020). For example, on 9 October 1963, a 270 million m 3 mass slid into the newly constructed Vajont Reservoir (Italy). It generated a huge wave that overtopped the dam and killed nearly 2000 people (Genevois and Ghirotti, 2005). Another dramatic example comes from Zhouqu County, China, where a massive debris flow took place on 7 August 2010, destroying more than 200 houses and killing approximately 1700 people (Dijkstra et al., 2012). Indeed, despite the progress in mitigation efforts, geohazards still pose a major threat to humans. For example, Chinese Government data indicate that each year thousands of geohazards occur in mainland China, causing more than hundreds of deaths and a direct economic loss of billions of RMB, as shown in Fig. 1(a-c) (NBSC, 2018).</p>
        <p>With accelerated population growth and limited land resources, human settlements are becoming a necessity in mountainous regions susceptible to landslides and debris flows (van Steijn, 1996;Van Den Eeckhaut et al., 2007;Frattini and Crosta, 2013). This trend is especially evident in developing countries, where many construction projects have been carried out in mountainous regions (Sidle and Ziegler, 2012;Zhou and Zhao, 2013;Li et al., 2014;Juang et al., 2019). With a total investment in billions of U.S. dollars, the Three Gorges Dam in China represents a prominent example of a megaproject located in a mountainous region (Highland, 2008;Tang et al., 2019a). According to Liu et al. (2007), in the few years following the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in 2003, over 5700 geohazards occurred in the TGR region (Fig. 1d). The susceptibility to landslides and debris flows in the mountainous areas can be compounded by ongoing climate changes, especially under extreme weather conditions (Nadim et al., 2006;Lama and Devkota, 2009;Huggel et al., 2012). Moreover, land-use change or geomorphic change brought about by human activities can also have a profound impact on geohazard activity and the occurrence of disasters linked to slope surface processes (Sidle et al., 2004;Wasowski et al., 2010;Cendrero et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Limited choices of settlement locations in mountainous regions imply a higher risk to the settlers as, out of necessity, they often have to occupy the only available flattish ground of alluvial terraces or debris flow fans, which are susceptible to both flooding and geohazards (consecutive disasters). The Zhouqu County event (Dijkstra et al., 2012) serves as a painful reminder of this dilemma and the geohazard threat in mountainous regions. Thus, an improved understanding of the interactions between human activities and the natural environment is a necessary pre-requisite for the efforts aimed at the reduction of impacts of geohazards in mountainous regions (Van Den Eeckhaut et al., 2007;Zimmermann and Keiler, 2015;Lyu et al., 2018;Juang et al., 2019;Wasowski and Pisano, 2020).</p>
        <p>This paper explores the past relationships between human activities and geohazards in the TGR mountainous region. In particular, we investigate the causes of the repeated relocations of the Badong County seat. Badong County is located about 69 km upstream from the Three Gorges Dam (Fig. 1d). Throughout its history that goes back to the Sui dynasty (598 CE), the county seat was relocated three times (Fig. 2). The First Relocation included a series of county seat transfers in the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE), likely due to the Yangtze River floods and geohazards events. The Second Relocation during 1982-2003 was primarily due to the Three Gorges Dam's construction and secondarily to the debris flow hazard. The Third Relocation took place between 2007 and 2017 under the threat of the reactivation of a giant landslide. By reconstructing these relocations, we aim to better understand the interactions between human activities and geohazards and the rationale behind the decision-making, thus providing insights into the sustainable development in mountainous regions.</p>
        <p>According to Yudi Guangji (Ouyang et al., 2003), a book containing geographical records edited during 1111-1117 (in the Song dynasty), the Badong County was set up as a county-level administrative unit in 598 CE Jiuxianping, a town located on the north bank of the Yangtze River, was then selected as the county seat (Fig. 2). The records in Daqing Yitong Zhi (Mu and Pan, 2008), another ancient book published during the period 1686-1842 (Qing dynasty), indicated that in 981-983 CE (Song dynasty), the county seat of Badong was transferred to Xinling, a town located on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, subsequently, the county seat was moved back to Jiuxianping before its final transfer to Xinling. The exact timing of these county seat transfers and the reasons behind them are not known, though historical accounts can be found in the poetry literature (Lu, 1925;Chen, 2003) and local legends.</p>
        <p>An archaeological survey in 1984 discovered the ruins of Jiuxianping. Later, a comprehensive study of the Jiuxianping Site in 1994 concluded that most ruins would have been submerged below the designed reservoir water level of the Three Gorges Dam. The Jiuxianping Site was excavated from 2001 to 2003, involving an archaeological area of 28,000 m 2 . Many cultural relics from the pre-Song dynasty were unearthed, and the layout of the county seat in the Song dynasty was revealed (SCTGPCC and NCHA, 2010). The reconstructed urban development of the county seat during different periods in the Song dynasty is shown in Fig. 3(a). Below, the possible timing and reasons for the transfers of the county seat during the First Relocation period are assessed.</p>
        <p>The subsurface stratigraphy of the Jiuxianping Administrative Zone suggests that the county seat was submerged four times and rebuilt three times during the Song dynasty (SCTGPCC and NCHA, 2010). In particular, four layers with different cultural relics were recognized, and all of them were overlain by sandy units of flood origin (Fig. 3b). Thus, it is apparent that during the First Relocation period, the county seat was likely transferred four times from Jiuxianping (on the north bank of the Yangtze River) to Xinling (on the south bank). These transfers were likely due to the Yangtze River floods. Except for the last transfer, the county seat was moved back to Jiuxianping each time after the floods. Thanks to the presence of cultural relics, the probable times of these county seat transfers can be estimated: 1) Early-Middle Northern Song (consistent with the records in Daqing Yitong Zhi), 2) Late Northern Song, 3) Early Southern Song (in agreement with the poetry of Si Rong), and 4) Middle-Late Southern Song. Notably, the county seat in Jiuxianping was the most prosperous in the Late Northern Song period, as evidenced by the extent of the Residential and Commerce zones shown in Fig. 3(a). In light of the above findings, an interesting question arises: why was the county seat transferred back to Jiuxianping three times, but afterward, a new location (Xinling) was preferred? A geomorphologic assessment of the area around the Jiuxianping indicated that the terrain was moderately sloping and located close to the river. Thus, Jiuxianping must have been a popular site for human settlements, which might be the reason for the repeated rebuilding of the county seat there after the floods. Further, the north river bank generally receives more sunlight than the south bank; and, in the context of the Chinese "Feng Shui," the houses are preferably south-facing. Finally, according to traditional The final abandonment of Jiuxianping may be attributed to the landslide and debris flows, which, respectively, hit the western and eastern parts of the county seat (Fig. 3c) during the Middle-Late Southern Song period (SCTGPCC and NCHA, 2010). Evidence for the occurrence of a damaging landslide comes from a 200 m long gravel road between the west Tomb Zone and the west Residential Zone. The archaeological survey report (SCTGPCC and NCHA, 2010) indicated that the relics from the Middle-Late Southern Song period were unearthed at both left and right sides of the road, while these relics were not discovered along the road. As such, we may infer that the landslide with an estimated width of 200 m destroyed the houses built in the Middle-Late Southern Song period and transported their remains down to the Yangtze River. Elsewhere, in the eastern part of the county seat, the subsurface stratigraphy revealed a mixed gravelly-sandy deposit of debris flow origin (SCTGPCC and NCHA, 2010). This deposit layer was found above the cultural layer of the Middle-Late Southern Song period, implying that the debris flow was a destructive agent in the eastern part of the county seat.</p>
        <p>Xinling Town is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River (Fig. 2) and the north slope of the Jinzi Mountain, characterized by a dip-slope structure. Considering the local geological setting, the town area at the foot of the mountain could be susceptible to landslides and debris flows during the rainy season (from May to September). Moreover, most of the town's houses were distributed along the Yangtze River bank and, therefore, potentially vulnerable to flooding. Nevertheless, except for the flood in July 1981 that destroyed 213 houses in Xinling (CCBCA, 1993), catastrophic geohazards or flood events had rarely been reported over the past 1000 years. Hence, following the First Relocation in the Song dynasty, the county seat remained in Xinling for a long time.</p>
        <p>The recent threat to the town came from the Gezhouba Dam, the first dam on the Yangtze River constructed between 1971 and 1988. Upon completing the Gezhouba Dam, the town's houses located below the elevation of 99 m were expected to be submerged. This problem affected only a small part of Xinling; the involved residents and factories were relocated in 1979-1983. In total, 55 families and three factories were resettled at the foothill of the Jinzi Mountain, with a cost of 35 million RMB (CCBCA, 1993). It was a small-scale relocation compared to the resettlement program initiated later by the Chinese Government for the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. The Three Gorges Dam project prompted a relocation of more than 1.1 million people from the expected inundation areas, including the whole town of Xinling, to accommodate the planned TGR operational water level of 145-175 m. Thus, the county seat of Badong again had to be relocated. Following the recommendations of two consulting firms (Xie and Tan, 2008), the county seat was relocated to Huangtupo, 1.0 km west of Xinling (Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>The construction of the new city at Huangtupo started in 1982. Pieces of evidence of slope instability, including ground displacements, cracks, and rockfalls, were observed during the construction period. An in-depth site investigation conducted in 1988 by a third consulting firm indicated the presence of two giant ancient landslides at Huangtupo, which was later confirmed by a fourth consulting firm in 1989. However, after seven years of construction activity and an investment of more than 180 million RMB, the new city with a size of approximately 200,000 m 2 had been built at Huangtupo. Many residents and factories in Xinling had already been resettled there. Hence, public debates arose as to "whether the new city of Huangtupo was indeed built on the site with huge landslides and what to do next."</p>
        <p>The resettlement debate was interrupted by a series of catastrophic debris flows that occurred on 6 August 1991 on the north slope of the Jinzi Mountain (Fig. 4). The debris flows were triggered by an intense storm (i.e., 183 mm of rain in 11 h). With a total volume of 300,000 m 3 , the debris flows destroyed the southern part of Xinling. Overall, three people lost their lives, 171 were injured, and 2591 houses were severely damaged, with a direct loss of 90 million RMB (Tan, 2015). Under such circumstances, the enthusiasm about the new city of Huangtupo was reignited as people desperately needed new space to move into, while the threat of potential future landslides was ignored. Subsequently, the old county seat in Xinling was submerged in 2003, following the rise of the TGR water level. By that time, most of the residents and factories had been relocated from Xinling to Huangtupo.</p>
        <p>The resettlement program in the TGR region led to a massive urban expansion in the reservoir area, with most people resettled in the cities. In this process, the plans for the new Badong County seat foresaw a population of 90,000 in 1993. Meanwhile, another investigation conducted by a fifth consulting firm in 1992 re-confirmed that the urban area of Huangtupo occupied the site of an ancient landslide (Tan, 2015). The new city construction began in Xirangpo (Fig. 2), while the construction activities in Huangtupo slowed down. In 1995, two landslides occurred in Huangtupo (Tan, 2015): the 60,000 m 3 Erdaogou landslide and the 128,000 m 3 Sandaogou landslide (Fig. 5). The Erdaogou landslide killed five people and destroyed three houses, with a direct economic loss of 20 million RMB. There were no casualties reported in the Sandaogou landslide case as an emergency evacuation was enforced before the landslide event; however, its economic losses were more significant. Later, during the impoundment of the TGR, three other landslides occurred in Huangtupo (Tan, 2015; Fig. 5). It became evident that Huangtupo was not a suitable location for the new county seat.</p>
        <p>Following the two catastrophic landslides in 1995, another site investigation was undertaken at Huangtupo by a sixth consulting firm from 2001 to 2002 (Tan, 2015). In particular, two exploratory tunnels (with a total length of 504 m) and 71 boreholes (with a total length of 4341 m) were made to reveal the stratigraphic configuration at Huangtupo. The subsurface investigation further proved that Huangtupo was the site of a giant ancient landslide (69.2 million m 3 in volume). As depicted in Fig. 5, the Huangtupo landslide can be further divided into four 'smaller' landslides: the Yuanyichang, Biandianzhan, No.1 Linjiang, and No.2 Linjiang landslides. The volumes of these four 'smaller' landslides are 13.5 million m 3 , 13.3 million m 3 , 22.5 million m 3 , and 19.9 million m 3 , respectively.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that unlike the first two investigations, the last four all indicated the presence of ancient landslides at Huangtupo, although with varying degrees of evidence and knowledge. However, only the sixth investigation revealed the subsurface stratigraphic configuration at Huangtupo, thanks to a vastly increased investigation effort (i.e., a large increase in the number of boreholes and the use of exploratory tunnels). The accurate stratigraphic configuration, coupled with frequent landslides at Huangtupo and the improved understanding of landslides during the past two decades, led to the final diagnosis of the Huangtupo landslide. The need to have an adequate site investigation effort in such an event was demonstrated.</p>
        <p>Considering the risk of landslide reactivation by the long-term reservoir operation and the human activities in Huangtupo, a comprehensive landslide monitoring system, including underground and surface components, was built in 2003. With the aid of this monitoring system, several landslide reactivations have successfully been forecasted (Tan, 2015). The Third Relocation of Badong County seat, from Huangtupo to Xirangpo and Guandukou, was initiated in 2007 and completed in 2017. In this relocation, over 15,000 Huangtupo residents were resettled in Guandukou, where 2351 new houses had been built, while the government and commercial operations were moved to Xirangpo. The direct cost of the Third Relocation was more than 1.17 billion RMB (Tan, 2015). The buildings constructed at Huangtupo during the previous relocation were demolished to reduce the overloading on the Huangtupo landslide.</p>
        <p>For this third relocation, the sites of Xirangpo and Guandukou were carefully and thoroughly investigated, although the investigation efforts were not at the same level as those at the site of Huangtupo landslide. These investigation efforts were considered adequate, as they benefited from the accumulated knowledge of geohazards and the observation data at Huangtupo and surrounding areas in the past two decades.</p>
        <p>The analysis of historical documents and geological data allows the reconstruction of the multiple relocation events of Badong County seat (Fig. 6). The First Relocation period (960-1279 CE) was characterized by several back-and-forth transfers of the county seat, which could be attributed to the Yangtze River floods and geohazards (landslides/debris flows). The Second Relocation was linked to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam and geohazards (debris flows), and the Third Relocation (2007-2017) was related to the non-recognition of pre-existing and potential new geohazards (landslides) during the site selection (termed 'siting') for new settlements. Indeed, these multiple local relocations represent only a subset of the human migrations in the TGR mountainous region. The threat of floods and geohazards has long played a significant role in the decision-making regarding human settlements.</p>
        <p>During the First Relocation period, the back-and-forth transfers represented a passive response of the residents to the frequent recurrence of natural disasters. Without the benefit of modern science and technologies, these transfers appeared to be an effective strategy (i.e., hazard avoidance). On the other hand, the Second Relocation could be viewed as an active strategy since the residents had to move to higher ground (because Xinling Town was about to be inundated under the reservoir's designed water level). However, an inadequate site investigation failed to recognize the existence of a giant ancient landslide, which, coupled with the other geohazards induced or reactivated by the TGR operation and the human activities on Huangtupo, led to the Third Relocation.</p>
        <p>Although the site selected for the Second Relocation of the Badong County seat may be viewed as a negative example in a siting study, lessons learned from the sequence of human activities associated with this relocation are meaningful. For example, based on the monitoring data regarding this giant reservoir landslide, the knowledge of reservoir landslides has been significantly improved, and new technologies for stabilizing landslides have been advanced (Tang et al., 2019a). With the improved knowledge on reservoir landslides and the associated technological advances, the local communities' resilience (i.e., the ability to prevent, mitigate, cope with, and recover from geohazard disasters) in this region has been enhanced. Unlike the Second Relocation, the Third Relocation from Huangtupo to Xirangpo and Guandukou may be viewed as a positive example in the siting study of human settlements, benefiting from the advances in technologies and the lessons learned from past failures. The site choice has proved correct, as no geohazard incidents have been reported in the newly urbanized areas since the completion of the relocation in 2017.</p>
        <p>The interactions between human activities and geohazards in Fig. 6. Timing of the multiple relocations of Badong County seat, history of associated hazards, and the Three Gorges Dam construction.</p>
        <p>W. Gong et al.</p>
        <p>mountainous regions are complex. The lessons learned from the multiple relocations of Badong County seat enhance the understanding of these interactions. The geohazards may lead to a disturbance of human activities, even causing an abandonment of human settlements (e.g., Jiuxianping and Huangtupo). Whereas the lessons learned from past events can guide siting studies for human settlements, and the accumulated knowledge and advanced technologies can further enhance the communities' resilience. On the contrary, human activities (e.g., the Three Gorges Dam's construction, the periodic fluctuation of the reservoir water level, and settlements) may reactivate pre-existing geohazards or induce new geohazards. Improved understanding of these complex interactions is a pre-requisite for future site selections of human settlements and other engineering projects in the mountainous regions.</p>
        <p>The impact of human activities on geohazards may be revealed through two effects: increasing load and reducing resistance. For example, the new city construction on Huangtupo increased the load (caused by new buildings). It reduced the resistance of the sliding mass (e.g., shear strength of the slip surface may be reduced due to the construction disturbance). In comparison, the stabilization efforts (e.g., by installing stabilizing piles) can increase the resistance.</p>
        <p>It is vitally important to implement an effective and proactive monitoring strategy when facing the threat of geohazards in populated areas (Wasowski and Bovenga, 2015;Kirschbaum and Stanley, 2018). Moreover, operational monitoring can enhance disaster resilience, especially when combined with early warning capability. The monitoring data can also help analyze the spatio-temporal behaviors of geohazards, which is significant for predictive purposes. In this section, we take the giant Huangtupo landslide as an example to demonstrate how the collection and analysis of the ground and monitoring information can lead to a better understanding of the landslide activity and behavior, and thereby enhance disaster resilience. To study the Huangtupo landslide, a field test facility, known as the Badong Field Test Station (BFTS), was constructed by the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) from 2009 to 2012. The BFTS consists of a tunnel complex in the No.1 Linjiang landslide and a series of ground monitoring components (Fig. 7; Tang et al., 2015a&amp; Tang et al., 2019a).</p>
        <p>The tunnel complex built within the landslide allows close observation of the bedrock, sliding mass, and slip surfaces. The mechanical and hydraulic properties of the sliding mass can be directly determined via in-situ tests in the tunnel. The deformations within the sliding mass and on the ground surface, the earth pressures and the pore water pressures within the sliding mass, the rainfall at Huangtupo, and the TGR water level are monitored real-time. The monitoring data enable the stability assessment of the existing landslides and potential slope failures under the long-term operation of the TGR (Sun et al., 2016;Tang et al., 2015a &amp; b). It is worth noting that the test facilities at BFTS provide a comprehensive means to study and monitor the Huangtupo landslide and offer a model field test station for research, education, and development of the next generation of engineering geologists.</p>
        <p>In some cases, landslide activity can be simply assessed by detecting and mapping the development of cracks at the ground surface, as these features can be taken as evidence of instability. An exhaustive field investigation was conducted in 2008 to detect the ground surface cracks at Huangtupo. More than 150 cracks were mapped, whose distribution is shown in Fig. 8. Most of the cracks were perpendicular to the landslide sliding direction (or roughly parallel to the Yangtze River), indicating tensile origin. The numbers of cracks identified within the four 'smaller' landslides (Yuanyichang, Biandianzhan, No. 1 Linjiang, and No. 2 Linjiang) were 6, 40, 76, and 28, respectively. Thus, in relative terms, the stability of No.1 Linjiang landslide might be the lowest, followed in sequence by Biandianzhan, No. 2 Linjiang, and Yuanyichang. Further, the density of the ground surface cracks at the toe of the Huangtupo landslide was greater than that at the crown, implying that the reactivation of this giant landslide might be induced by the failure of the toe. The long-term operation of the reservoir might have contributed to this phenomenon.</p>
        <p>The ground monitoring system at Huangtupo included the surface displacement measurements obtained using mainly the Global Positioning System (GPS) and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). The GPS monitoring relied on 25 GPS stations (Fig. 8), among which two were set up as the reference points. Based on the GPS results, the northeast (NE20 • ) sliding direction of the Huangtupo landslide was ascertained. For illustration purposes, the ground surface displacements of the Huangtupo landslide during the period between 2003 and 2009 are plotted in Fig. 9. The results showed that the No.1 Linjiang landslide was affected by the largest cumulative displacements (i.e., greater than 150 mm), followed by the Biandianzhan landslide (i.e., with displacements greater than 70 mm), No. 2 Linjiang landslide, and Yuanyichang landslide. Notably, the monitoring results were consistent with the indications of the relative instability based on the ground surface crack observations.</p>
        <p>Although the magnitude of the monitored surface displacement varied somewhat among the GPS stations, the surface displacements generally increased with time in a stepwise manner (Fig. 9). The stepwise displacement phenomenon is a common feature of reservoir landslides due to the periodic fluctuation of the reservoir water level and the rainfall seasonality (Song et al., 2018;Tang et al., 2019a). Illustrated in Fig. 10 is the relationship between the monthly rate of the surface displacements of No. 1 Linjiang landslide and the time. Fig. 10 also shows data of the reservoir water level and the rainfall collected each month. The fluctuation of the reservoir water level was modest from September 2004 to September 2006, and the monthly rate of the displacements matched the rainfall data. The monthly rate of the displacements in the rainy season was about 5.0 mm/month, while in the dry season, it was less than 2.0 mm/month. The influence of rainfall on the displacement was reasonably uniform within the landslide.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the displacements from September 2006 to September 2009 were induced by a combination of the seasonal rainfall and the reservoir water level's periodic fluctuation. Hence, the influence of the reservoir water level's fluctuation on the displacements may be approximated by removing the displacements caused by the seasonal rainfall. During the impoundment of the reservoir, the monthly rate of the displacements was slightly decreased. In contrast, during the drawdown of the reservoir, the monthly rate was increased dramatically (i.e., 9.0-12.0 mm/month). This influence of the reservoir water level fluctuation on the displacements decreased with the number of the impoundment-drawdown cycles and the distance from the river.</p>
        <p>In summary, the monthly rate of the surface displacements was high during the drawdown of the reservoir and relatively low during the reservoir impoundment (Fig. 10a). This pattern could apply to many reservoir landslides in the TGR region (Tang et al., 2019b). Moreover, the rate of the surface displacements was high in the rainy seasons and relatively low in other periods (Fig. 10b). It should be noted that the influences of the periodic fluctuation of the reservoir water level and the rainfall on the displacements and stability of a landslide can be complicated. The mechanical and hydraulic properties of the sliding mass, the intensity and duration of the rainfall, and the rate of the fluctuation of the reservoir water level can all be contributing factors. The underlying mechanism may only be revealed through detailed coupled hydraulic-mechanical analyses.</p>
        <p>The subsurface landslide displacements obtained from inclinometers indicated the presence of multiple sliding zones within the Huangtupo landslide (Tang et al., 2015b). The depths of these sliding zones generally corresponded to the depths of weak interlayers (i.e., whose strengths were smaller than those of the neighboring layers). In particular, the tunnel excavation in the No.1 Linjiang landslide revealed three major sliding zones. The uranium-thorium dating of the calcite samples from the sliding zones helped interpret the timing of the historical activity of the Huangtupo landslide. The results obtained from the uranium-thorium dating, conducted on a MAT-262 instrument at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), indicated three distinctive episodes of pre-historic movement of the No.1 Linjiang landslide. Their apparent ages were estimated to be 40 × 10 4 a ~ 38 × 10 4 a, 31 × 10 4 a ~ 30 × 10 4 a, and 22 × 10 4 a ~ 18 × 10 4 a, respectively (Lu, 2017). Besides, through borehole investigations, samples of the sliding zones of the No. 2 Linjiang and Biandianzhan landslides were collected. The uranium-thorium dating results showed three distinctive episodes of prehistoric activity for the No. 2 Linjiang landslide, and their apparent ages matched those of the No.1 Linjiang landslide. As for the Biandianzhan landslide, the uranium-thorium dating suggested a much younger period of pre-historic activity, with an apparent age of 16 × 10 4 a ~ 13 × 10 4 a (Lu, 2017). The above findings denote a very long and complicated history of slope movements at Huangtupo. The episodes of the pre-historic activity demonstrate that natural causes were sufficient to destabilize the Huangtupo landslide periodically. Today, climate changes, as well as increasing anthropogenic pressures, represent additional factors that complicate the natural hazard assessment (Sidle et al., 2004;Cendrero et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The events associated with the county seat relocations in Badong, a typical county in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region, China, were studied and reconstructed in this paper. With lessons learned from both failed and successful relocations, the community resilience in the TGR region has been enhanced.</p>
        <p>The implications of this study could be summarized as follows. First, in a siting study of human settlements in mountainous regions, it is vital to conduct a proper site investigation and obtain useful data needed for a comprehensive assessment of susceptibility to natural hazards and the potential impact of human activities on the local geological environment. However, siting a megaproject such as the relocation of a city cannot be solely a technical issue; often, political considerations may outweigh the technical preference. From a geological engineering perspective, an in-depth site investigation that provides adequate data to address the technical problems and anticipate the future impacts of human activities on the local geological environment should always be the first requirement. Second, although our understanding of geohazards has substantially improved over the last few decades, it is far from perfect. For example, in only a few years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, human activities coupled with post-seismic geohazards necessitated multiple relocations (Zhang et al., 2014;Fan et al., 2018). This reminds us that sustainable development in mountainous regions could only be achieved if harmony between human activities and local geological environments is ensured. Third and finally, in the pursuit of disaster resilience enhancement, the importance of an effective strategy to monitor hazards cannot be over-emphasized. Our knowledge about nature is vastly incomplete; proactive monitoring, which is essentially a "learn as you go" approach (Peck, 1969), reflects our awareness and high respect for the often-unpredictable power of nature.</p>
