        <p>The rapid growth of marine renewables has led to the development of very large floating structures (VLFS) that are designed to operate in deep seas. It is significant to understand the mechanism of the coupled effects between deformable VLFS and catenary mooring system. This paper presents a time-domain hydro-elastic-moored model developed by integrating a quasi-static mooring module into a fully coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -discrete-modulebeam (DMB) approach. The model is used to investigate the coupled effects between structural hydroelasticity and loose-type mooring systems on a deformable VLFS in waves. The mooring and hydroelasticity codes are validated separately and show favourable agreement with other numerical and experimental results. Then the coupled effects between the mooring system and structural hydroelasticity are evaluated by assigning various design parameters, i.e., VLFS structural stiffness and mooring stiffness. The numerical results, including dynamic motions, longitudinal vertical bending moments (VBMs) and mooring tension forces are presented and analysed. These results can be used to design a VLFS with mooring in medium-deep sea, and help with the conventional mooring design for a less-stiffness VLFS due to hydroelastic response.The rapid growth of marine renewables has led to the development of very large floating structures (VLFS) that are designed to operate in deep seas.

        <p>Very large floating structures (VLFSs) offer several advantages, including environmental friendliness, low cost, good mobility, and short construction periods, making them widely used in the maritime industry. Their potential as developable land around coastal cities for residential, industrial, and logistic purposes has been extensively studied [1]. For instance, there were projects delivered using VLFS as floating airports and cities between 1995 and 2000 (Ohmatsu, 2005), as well as concepts proposing the use of VLFS for large floating farms and floating ecopolis [2]. However, due to the large scale of such structures, their elastic deformations under wave excitations become prominent than rigid-body motions. Therefore, to accurately predict the deflection and stress distribution of VLFSs while considering environmental excitations, it is necessary to perform hydroelastic analysis during the design phase.Very large floating structures (VLFSs) offer several advantages, including environmental friendliness, low cost, good mobility, and short construction periods, making them widely used in the maritime industry.

        <p>In recent decades, many researchers have presented studies on the hydroelasticity of VLFS with various environmental conditions. The experimental studies were conducted by Refs. [3][4][5]. In parallel, several numerical studies have been presented based on a partitioned fluid structure interaction (FSI) approach to investigate on the elastic deformation of the VLFS in waves. The data communication between the fluid and structure solver is accomplished through the FSI framework. Various FSI frameworks have been established in the literature by combining different fluid and structural solvers. To name a few, potential flow theory coupled with finite element method (FEA) has been established by Refs. [6,7], and potential flow coupled with multi-body dynamic method (MBD) has been established by Refs.

        <p>Limitations arise from the potential flow theory, which does not take into account fluid viscosity. For FSI problems, the complex flow behaviours can only be accurately simulated by CFD methods. Thus, the fully nonlinear CFD method is commonly used as an alternative. It can also be coupled with a structural solver to study the elastic behaviour of a floating barge in waves, for an example, coupled CFD and FEA to a very flexible barge [10].Limitations arise from the potential flow theory, which does not take into account fluid viscosity.

        <p>The mooring design of a VLFS is necessary for stabilising the structure apart from wave drifts. Various types of mooring systems can be used for VLFS, including tension leg, taut line, and catenary mooring lines. However, the specific mooring system design will depend on a range of factors such as water depth, environmental conditions, and the specific design of the VLFS. When placing the VLFS towards the intermediate-deep sea, loose-type mooring lines are mostly used, such as taut legs and catenary type of moorings. These types of mooring use weight to stabilise the structure and hang between the fairlead and anchoring. Catenary mooring has a part of the mooring line lying down on the seabed, which means the seabed effects must be considered as well.The mooring design of a VLFS is necessary for stabilising the structure apart from wave drifts.

        <p>Efforts are underway to consider the influence of mooring dynamics on the structural hydroelasticity of VLFS with low rigidity. Researchers have explored a range of configurations, from two-body articulated mooing system [11], to multi-body-beam setups [6]. [12] investigated the effectiveness of vertical mooring lines in reducing the hydroelasticity of the VLFS in various incident wave angles and wavelengths using a hybrid Finite element (FE) -Boundary element (BE) method. The stiffness of the mooring lines is optimised for maximum reduction of hydroelastic responses by using differential evolution algorithm. [13] studied the coupled effects of a modular type of VLFS with the catenary type of mooring system. However, the VLFS structure used by the authors had a large stiffness, so the elastic deflections had limited effects in their cases. The authors concluded that the hydroelasticity becomes more important for those VLFS structure with less stiffness. [7] studied the effects of tension leg types of mooring lines on a very-large floating structure. They concluded that the hydroelasticity effect leads to larger vertical responses and mooring tensions compared to the rigid-body case, and the maximum mooring tension of the elastic case is 1.5 times higher than that of rigid body. [14] found that increasing mooring stiffness can reduce the vertical motion and bending moments of the structure. [15] studied the dynamic behaviour of a moored articulated floating structure in waves using 
            <rs type="software">AQWA</rs>. They found that the mooring stiffness has a great influence on structural motions, leading to high stress on the connection components of the modular structure. This poses an important design criterion for VLFS.

        <p>As a matter of fact, the studies on the coupled structural hydroelasticity and loose-type mooring system are rare in the open literature. Some pioneer work has highlighted the importance of understanding the mechanics of such hydro-elastic-moored systems. [13] investigated the impact of the structural elastic deflection on mooring tension using a coupled time domain potential flow method. The authors noted that the high-frequency elastic deflection may have an impact on the fatigue performance of mooring lines which necessitates further research.As a matter of fact, the studies on the coupled structural hydroelasticity and loose-type mooring system are rare in the open literature.

        <p>To generate waves, the open-source wave generation library Waves2Foam [17] is applied to the

The wave absorption relies on the relaxation zone technique, which provides better wave quality near the inlet boundary and removes spurious reflection at the outlet boundary. These methods have been proven to be very effective in previous studies [18]. In this study, Stokes 2nd order wave theory is applied to represent the incident waves throughout all cases.

        <p>The wave domain is established in the CFD computations to simulate VLFS operating in heading waves. The domain is extended in three dimensions, i.e., -3L &lt; x &lt; 3.5L, -1.4L &lt; y &lt; 1.4L and -2.2L &lt; z &lt; 1L, where L refers to the VLFS length between perpendiculars (2.28 m). A general view of the wave domain (for the ratio of the wavelength to the structure length of λ/ L = 1.2) is shown in Fig. 1. As can be seen the side boundaries are placed far away from the VLFS sides to reduce the influence of wave reflection from numerical boundaries. Inside the numerical domain, the global Cartesian coordinate system is set at the same height level with the calm water surface, coinciding with the VLFS' centreline. Two sets of computational mesh are generated, using 3.85 M cells for wave frequency between ω s = 3.92 rad/s to 6.28 rad/s. Another set of mesh using 5.12 M of mesh to simulate short wave with wave frequencies lower than ω s = 3.92 rad/s. The mesh refinement is achieved near the free surface, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and the mesh sizes far from the surface layer are set larger to speed up overall computational time.

        <p>The validation study aims to examine the performance of the catenary type of mooring lines of the present OpenFOAM code. The numerical study is conducted based on a single rigid floater with four catenary mooring lines. The mooring lines are solved using the quasi-static method. The modelling settings, including the computational domain, mesh discretisation, and numerical scheme, follow those used by Ref. [24], as shown in Fig. 7. The overset mesh method, which accounts for the floating body motions, is used as the mesh motion solver in 
            <rs type="software">OpenFOAM</rs>. The vertical motions of the floater (surge, heave and pitch) and the tension forces (horizontal drag forces from Line 1 and Line 3) are measured under two regular heading waves with periods of T = 1.8s and 2.0s (see Fig. 8).

        <p>The numerical results are validated against the coupled OpenFOAM and MoorDyn method from Ref. [24] and experimental method from Ref. [25]. The computational time for the overset simulations (40 CPUs) is about 32 and 36 h for the two cases. Fig. 8 shows the structural dynamic motions of the VLFS, including heave (a), pitch (b) and surge (c). As it is shown in the figures that the numerical results are observed to converge with a mesh of 0.86 M. Fig. 8(c) and (d) demonstrate that some discrepancies are observed in pitch amplitude for both wave frequencies; however, the trend of the pitch curve generally shows good agreement between the present numerical results and those from Ref. [24]. The reason for these discrepancies may be related to the different mooring system principles employed. For example, the quasi-static mooring solver used in this study does not consider the hydrodynamic effects on the mooring lines, as was done in the previous work of [24]. Fig. 9 (a,b,c,d) displays the horizontal pull force component for the front and rear mooring lines under two wave conditions. The figures illustrate highly dynamic line tensions in both the front and rear lines, particularly in Fig. 9(b). Overall, there is good agreement between the experimental and numerical tension amplitudes for both the front and rear mooring lines.The numerical results are validated against the coupled OpenFOAM and MoorDyn method from Ref.

        <p>From the numerical validation presented in these figures, it is clear that the present CFD-DMB method is capable of predicting the displacements of a very flexible structure to an acceptable degree of accuracy. When compared to linear methods (Mars), predictions that take into account nonlinearities are better suited for flexible structures that introduce significant free surface disturbances at certain frequencies. Omitting these nonlinearities can result in underpredictions when compared to actual measurements. Fig. 12 shows the response amplitude operators (RAOs) of vertical bending moments (VBM), at location x/L = 0.5 and 0.66, along with comparisons from CFD-FEA and a 2D hydroelasticity study (Mars). Comparing the RAOs of VBM predicted by the CFD-FEA, it is seen that there is favourable agreement observed through all wave frequencies. However, the magnitudes of the calculated RAOs from both numerical methods show significant differences with the results from Mars at wave frequencies ranging from ω s = 4.5-6 rad/s. The large difference in vertical bending moment may be due to the application of a large VBM on the VLFS when the wavelength is equal to or near the characteristic length defined by the bending stiffness and the hydrostatic buoyancy coefficient [29]. Fig. 13 displays normalised deflection along the longitudinal sections of the VLFS in the wave frequency of ω s = 3.925 rad/s with four views in one complete wave cycle. It is evident that the structure underwent significant deformation during wave propagation.From the numerical validation presented in these figures, it is clear that the present CFD-DMB method is capable of predicting the displacements of a very flexible structure to an acceptable degree of accuracy.

        <p>An analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of six structural stiffnesses on the dynamic motions and internal loads of the VLFS for a head wave with a wave frequency of 3.925 rad/s, as shown in Fig. 14. In the model demonstration, the structural stiffness (EI) is increased multiple times while keeping the remaining parameters constant. The heave displacements and the VBMs are extracted from the node close to the centre of gravity. The numerical results indicate that increasing the stiffness from EI to 100EI causes the structural responses to gradually become smaller and approach those of a rigid body case. These results are consistent with the stiffness theory in structural mechanics, which states that increasing stiffness can reduce the amount of deflection or bending in a flexible structure when it is subjected to a single frequency load. However, the effect on the maximum bending moments is less pronounced for the cases without mooring attached. According to the elastic beam bending equation M = EI d 2 w dx 2 , where M is the bending moment, EI is the flexural rigidity, w is the deformation, bending moment is mainly dependent on the variation of E and w. In cases with changing stiffness, the deformation of the structure varies reversely, using the above equation, the bending moment at amidship has less influence on the structure's stiffness.An analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of six structural stiffnesses on the dynamic motions and internal loads of the VLFS for a head wave with a wave frequency of 3.925 rad/s, as shown in Fig. 14.

        <p>Fig. 17(a) shows the time trajectory of the vertical plane motion extracted at the midship of the VLFS for no mooring, catenary and taut mooring cases. The signals from mooring cases display circular shapes with repeat cycles that result from the movements of the structure following with wave particle motions. It is seen that heave motions by the cases of taut and catenary mooring are similar, but the structure is offered more in surge motions by equipping catenary mooring lines. This is because taut mooring lines apply the tension forces to the structure to avoid its drift in waves. As compared to cases with no mooring, it has been found that the heave displacement at the longitudinal of VLFS can be reduced when equipping with mooring lines, as evidenced by Ref. [13].Fig. 17(a) shows the time trajectory of the vertical plane motion extracted at the midship of the VLFS for no mooring, catenary and taut mooring cases.

        <p>Fig. 17(b) shows the vertical heave displacements at section #1 for cases with/without moorings. It is seen that by attaching a mooring system to flexible structure will cause the front section to sink because of the extra weight. For case with catenary exhibits slightly larger motions, with a 15% increase compared to the taut case. The reason for this is that catenary mooring relies mainly on the gravity from the lying down part of the mooring, while taut mooring has tension restraints directly from anchor points.Fig. 17(b) shows the vertical heave displacements at section #1 for cases with/without moorings.

When compared to the no mooring cases, it is evident that the sectional loads at fairlead sections change significantly. It is seen that the VBMs at front section #1 raises from 4.92Nm in no mooring case to 26.4Nm in catenary and taut mooring cases. The static case calculates the sectional loads of the VLFS in calm water, as shown in Fig. 17(d). It is seen that the structure stays in a permanent hogging shape with the catenary mooring (C_static) due to added weights onto two ends. The maximum hogging moments of the C_static case are detected at section #6 with a magnitude of 65.27Nm. The value is reduced to 41 Nm when considering the catenary case in waves, which can be attributed to the buoyancy compensation provided by the waves. The VLFS with taut mooring in calm water (T_static) shows a relative sagging shape (Fig. 17(d)) because the taut mooring not only induces gravity forces but also the pre-tensional forces onto the structure. The pre-tension forces drag the structure downward and distribute the force evenly to near segments without a local high peak VBMs occurs. This finding indicates that taut mooring lines are more suitable for this VLFS in calm water, and both taut and catenary moorings have similar performance in wave conditions.Catenary and taut type of mooring characteristics. compared between those with/without mooring at static water/wave (shown in Fig. 17(c andd)).

        <p>The longitudinal wave-induced VBMs distribution of both taut (T_wave) and catenary (C_wave) mooring cases in waves show a similar trend. The peak hogging moments for both mooring types are detected at section #3 and #9, as shown in Fig. 17(d). The changes are smooth towards the midship and the largest sagging moments are found 39.7Nm at section #5 for catenary case and 42.9Nm for taut cases. It can be concluded that attaching a mooring system to a slender, deformable structure has a significant effect on its hydroelasticity characteristics. By carefully selecting the mooring types and parameters, it is possible to reduce the local maximum VBMs and protect the structure from breaking apart. Fig. 18 shows the cases of catenary and taut mooring lines with waves under the maximum tension forces in the horizontal (_x) and vertical (_z) directions. From the figure, it can be seen that due to the symmetrical mooring arrangement, the tension fluctuations of Line1 and Line3 are basically the same. Taut type mooring lines generally have greater tension than catenary type, and the tension in the z direction will be greater than that in the x-axis direction due to the structural gravity. It can be seen from the figures that the structural motions and VBMs of both catenary and taut cases are not sensitive with mooring stiffness. Only a small difference appears in the forces from catenary mooring as shown in Fig. 20(c). Therefore, it can be concluded that increasing the stiffness of the catenary mooring lines has little influence on the hydroelasticity of the structure. The tensions on the mooring lines are also compared, and negligible differences are found among each case.The longitudinal wave-induced VBMs distribution of both taut (T_wave) and catenary (C_wave) mooring cases in waves show a similar trend.

        <p>This section presents a comprehensive study that investigates the impact of structural hydroelasticity on catenary type mooring lines. Four different VLFS stiffness, ranging from EI to 100EI, are evaluated accordingly. The numerical results, including the dynamic motions of the hydro-elastic-moored model and the tension forces in time domain are presented. The selected wave frequency is ω s = 3.925rad/s with a wave height of H s = 0.10m, representing a medium-long wave which is applied throughout all cases. Y. Wei et al. respect to four structural stiffness values (EI, 2EI, 10EI, and 100EI). With an increase in the stiffness of a moored-flexible VLF, the longitudinal heave motions undergo significant changes. Specifically, the deflection amplitudes at the middle section become smaller, but the motions at the two ends become larger. This is because an increase in stiffness alters the structural flexural characteristics, causing the rigid body state to dominate. As a result, global pitch motion leads to large displacements at both ends. When compared to the no-moored cases shown in Fig. 14(b), the VBMs of cases with catenary mooring lines increase drastically following with the structure stiffness. This is because the mooring system acts as a "soft" boundary condition, restraining the flexible structure by applying a force at two ends. These forces will cause a high VBMs at amid sections and the magnitude of VBMs increase with the stiffness of the structure. This previously unreported finding notices that slender and stiff structures attached with catenary moorings will experience larger VBMs at the amid section. A carefully designed mooring system is required, especially for stiff structures, to avoid the possibility of breakage.This section presents a comprehensive study that investigates the impact of structural hydroelasticity on catenary type mooring lines.

        <p>show the time-series tension forces at line 1 and line 3 at horizontal (_x) and vertical directions (_z) with four structural stiffness from EI to 100EI. The front mooring lines provide forces acting in the opposite direction to the wave propagation, and they experience tension forces similar to those acting on the rear lines. Table 4 summarises the peak tension forces for all structure stiffness in two directions. It can be observed that the elastic deflections of the VLFS significantly contribute to the tension forces in the mooring lines. The magnitudes of tension forces increase by 6% for all directions as the flexural rigidity of the VLFS . Two resonant frequencies can be observed in the figure: the primary frequency coincides with the incident wave frequency (depicted by orange dots), while the other corresponds to the mooring lines. The amplitude of the first frequency decreases with the increase of structural stiffness, while the amplitude of the second frequency increases.

In the case of 100EI, the structure is grey with an attached red catenary mooring, while in the case of EI, the structure is coloured with a black mooring attached. The figure shows that the fairleads move with the mooring sections due to local rigid body motions. As a result, the tension force/moments of each mooring line will pass to the corresponding rigid patch as a boundary condition to restrain the flexible structure's movements.Fig. 25 compares the virtual observation of structural deformation and fairlead positions at time t = 12.5s for two different structure stiffnesses (EI in colour and 100EI in grey).

        <p>The validations of mooring models and flexible structures show good agreement with previous simulations and experiments. The performance of mooring codes is validated by first using a benchmark case: a simple floating box restrained by catenary mooring in waves. The dynamic motions and mooring tension forces are evaluated at two wave frequencies, showing acceptable agreement with the experiments and coupled OpenFOAM&amp;MoorDyn models. Next, the hydroelastic behaviours of the flexible VLFS without mooring in waves are evaluated using the present CFD-DMB model. The numerical results, including heave displacements and internal loads at longitudinal VLFS sections, show favourable agreement with the numerical results from CFD-FEA and the experiments. An analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of six structural stiffnesses on the dynamic motions and internal loads of the VLFS in a heading wave frequency. The numerical results indicate that increasing the stiffness from EI to 100EI causes the structural responses to gradually become smaller and approach those of rigid body state.The validations of mooring models and flexible structures show good agreement with previous simulations and experiments.

        <p>• Attaching a loose-type mooring system to a slender, deformable structure drastically changes the hydrodynamic and hydroelastic behaviours of the flexible VLFS. It has been found that the longitudinal deflections of the VLFS are reduced by equipping a mooring. However, the sections at the two ends will sink due to the added weight at the fairlead positions. Cases with catenary mooring exhibit slightly larger motions in the vertical plane (i.e., surge and heave) compared to the taut case. • Equipping the loose type mooring system changes the flexural characteristics of the VLFS, including the static and wave-induced VBM distributions. The structure with the catenary mooring shows a hogging shape in calm water, with the peak is detected at middle section #6. In contrast, the case with taut mooring distributes the loads evenly to near sections, without any localized high peak VBMs. The results from wave-induced VBMs show that both catenary and taut case have peak hogging moments detected at section #3 and #9 (shown in Fig. 17(d)). However, mooring stiffness have less influences on the flexible structure motions in this study. • On the other hand, the hydroelastic behaviours also have significant impact on the mooring system. The dynamic motions of the hydro-elastic-moored model and the tension forces are evaluated with four structural stiffness. It is observed that the deflection amplitudes at the middle sections of the flexible VLFS become smaller as the stiffness of the structure increases, but the motions at the two ends become larger. This increase is also accompanied by a significant increase in the VBMs, especially at the middle sections (#4~#8) of the VLFS.• Attaching a loose-type mooring system to a slender, deformable structure drastically changes the hydrodynamic and hydroelastic behaviours of the flexible VLFS.
