        <p>Much of our understanding of Earth's past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic Era and to study their dynamics. Here we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states -Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse -are identified based on their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas levels and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the non-linear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.Much of our understanding of Earth's past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera.

        <p>Global changes in Earth's climate during the Cenozoic Era, the last 66 million years, have long been inferred from stable isotope data in carbonate shells of benthic foraminifers, which are single-celled amoeboid organisms that live on the seafloor. Carbon and oxygen isotope records from deep-sea benthic foraminifers are a proven, invaluable archive of long-term changes in Earth's carbon cycle, deep-sea temperature, and seawater composition driven by changes in ice volume (1,2). In 1975, Shackleton and Kennett (3) produced one of the first deep-sea benthic foraminifer stable isotope records of the Cenozoic. Despite being of low temporal resolution it revealed that Earth's climate had transitioned from a warm state 60 to 40 million years ago (Ma) to a cool state 10 to 5 Ma. Over the last 45 years, many deep-sea benthic foraminifer stable isotope records of variable length and quality have been developed, resulting in a more detailed record of Cenozoic climate change. Compilations of these deep-sea isotope records provide a compelling chronicle of past trends, cyclic variations, and transient events in the climate system from the Late Cretaceous to today (1,(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10). However, even the most recent benthic isotope compilations cannot accurately document the full range and detailed characteristics of Cenozoic climate variability on time scales of ten thousand to one million years. Age models and temporal resolution of Cenozoic benthic isotope compilations are either too coarse and/or include gaps, particularly prior to 34 Ma. These weaknesses hamper progress in determining the dynamics of the Cenozoic climate system (4,9,11), for example, because they prohibit application of advanced techniques of non-linear time series analysis at the required (astronomical) time-scales.Global changes in Earth's climate during the Cenozoic Era, the last 66 million years, have long been inferred from stable isotope data in carbonate shells of benthic foraminifers, which are single-celled amoeboid organisms that live on the seafloor.

        <p>Here, we present a new astronomically tuned deep-sea benthic foraminifer carbon δ 13 C and oxygen δ 18 O isotope reference record uniformly covering the entire Cenozoic, developed in our laboratories using sediment archives retrieved by scientific ocean drilling (Fig. 1). To produce this new composite record, we selected 14 ocean drilling records, checked and revised their composite splices where necessary, and preferentially selected records utilizing the genus Cibicidoides and Nuttallides to minimize systematic interspecies isotopic offsets (1,4,12,13).Here, we present a new astronomically tuned deep-sea benthic foraminifer carbon δ 13 C and oxygen δ 18 O isotope reference record uniformly covering the entire Cenozoic, developed in our laboratories using sediment archives retrieved by scientific ocean drilling (Fig. 1).

        <p>We additionally generated new benthic stable isotope data spanning the late Miocene and middle-to-late Eocene to fill intervals inadequately covered by existing records. We collated existing astrochronologies for all records, recalibrated them to the La2010b orbital solution (14) if required, and developed a new astrochronology for the middle-to-late Eocene (13). We estimate our chronology to be accurate to ± 100-kyr for the Paleocene and Eocene, ± 50-kyr for the Oligocene to middle Miocene, and ± 10-kyr for the late Miocene to Pleistocene. The composite record is affected by some spatial bias arising from the uneven distribution of deepsea stable isotope data that mainly derive from low-to mid-latitudes (13). Nevertheless, the resulting new Cenozoic Global Reference benthic foraminifer carbon and oxygen Isotope Dataset (CENOGRID) provides a refined record with higher signal-to-noise ratio than any previous compilations ((13); text S1), and better coverage of the Paleocene, Eocene and late Miocene intervals (Fig. S32).

        <p>On time scales of ten thousand to one million years, global climate is a complex, dynamical system responding non-linearly to quasi-periodic astronomical forcing. By combining the latest high-resolution generation of Cenozoic deep-sea isotope records on a highly accurate timescale, CENOGRID enables the definition of Earth's fundamental climates and investigation of the predictability of their dynamics. We used recurrence analysis (RA) of the CENOGRID record (13,15) to identify fundamental climate states that internally share characteristic and statistically distinctive dynamics. Recurrence is a major property of dynamical systems and RA provides information about non-linear dynamics, dynamical transitions, and even non-linear interrelationships (15), and facilitates evaluation of underlying dynamical processes -e.g., whether they are stochastic, regular, or chaotic. We present recurrence plots and their quantification of the benthic foraminifer δ 13 C and δ 18 O records to recognize different climate states and apply the RA measure of 'determinism' (DET) to quantify the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.On time scales of ten thousand to one million years, global climate is a complex, dynamical system responding non-linearly to quasi-periodic astronomical forcing.

        <p>Block-like structures in the recurrence plots identify epochs where the dynamical system is 'trapped' in a particular state. This interpretation of Cenozoic climate history is broadly consistent with previous interpretations but our recurrence plot analysis of the highly resolved CENOGRID data provides a more statistically robust and objective exposition of events. Detailed features of the four climate states can be inferred from the isotope profiles (Fig. 1) and scatter plots of the CENOGRID δ 13 C and δ 18 O data, and atmospheric CO2 concentration estimates (Fig. 2; (13)). Warmhouse and Hothouse states prevailed from the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (K/Pg, 66 Ma) to the Eocene-Oligocene Transition (EOT, 34 Ma). During the Warmhouse, global temperatures were more than 5°C warmer than today (13) and benthic δ 13 C and δ 18 O show a persistent positive correlation with one another. The Hothouse operated between the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum at 56 Ma and the end of the Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO) at 47 Ma ( 16), when temperatures were more than 10°C warmer than today and displayed greater amplitude variability. Transient warming events (hyperthermals) are an intrinsic feature of the Hothouse, wherein paired negative excursions in δ 13 C and δ 18 O reflect warming globally through rapid addition of carbon to the oceanatmosphere system. The two Warmhouse phases from 66 to 56 Ma (Paleocene) and 47 to 34 Ma (middle-late Eocene) share a similar temperature range but have distinct background δ 13 C isotope values and atmospheric CO2 levels (Fig. 2,S35). At the EOT, the Warmhouse transitioned into the Coolhouse state, marked by a stepwise, significant drop in temperature and a major increase in continental ice volume with large ice-sheets appearing on Antarctica (17) to establish a unipolar glacial state (18). The recurrence plots mark out the EOT as the most prominent transition of the whole Cenozoic, which highlights the important role of ice sheets in modulating Earth's climate state (Fig. S33; (13)).Block-like structures in the recurrence plots identify epochs where the dynamical system is 'trapped' in a particular state.

        <p>The Coolhouse state spans ~34 Ma (EOT) to 3.3 Ma (mid Pliocene M2 glacial), and is divided into two phases by the marked shift in δ 18 O increase at 13.9 Ma related to the expansion of Antarctic ice sheets during the middle Miocene Climate Transition (mMCT; (19)). Warmer conditions culminating in the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; ~17-14 Ma; (20)) characterize the first phase, followed by cooling and increasing δ 18 O during the second phase (Fig 2). RA of carbon isotope data documents an additional major transition in the carbon cycle around 7 Ma related to end of the late Miocene Carbon Isotope Shift (11,21,22). A major change in the correlation between benthic foraminifer δ 13 C and δ 18 O occurs during the Pliocene epoch (23).The Coolhouse state spans ~34 Ma (EOT) to 3.3 Ma (mid Pliocene M2 glacial), and is divided into two phases by the marked shift in δ 18 O increase at 13.9 Ma related to the expansion of Antarctic ice sheets during the middle Miocene Climate Transition (mMCT; (19)).

        <p>The Icehouse climate state (Fig. 2), driven by the appearance of waxing and waning ice sheets in the northern hemisphere, was fully established by the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition (24) (Fig. 1, 2) with Marine Isotope Stage M2 at 3.3 Ma being a possible harbinger. The recurrence plots are less pronounced and more transparent from 3.3 Ma to today (Fig. 2, S34), suggesting that Earth's climate-cryosphere dynamics entered a state not comparable to anything seen in the preceding 60 or more million years.The Icehouse climate state (Fig. 2), driven by the appearance of waxing and waning ice sheets in the northern hemisphere, was fully established by the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition (24) (Fig. 1, 2) with Marine Isotope Stage M2 at 3.3 Ma being a possible harbinger.

        <p>The CENOGRID allows us to scrutinize the state-dependency of climate system response to CO2 and astronomical forcing on ten thousand to one million year time scales (13). Astronomical forcing throughout the Cenozoic is consistently uniform, but the RA indicates that the non-linear response in climate variability to this forcing is strongly influenced by the fundamental state of climate. Evolutionary spectrograms characterize the dominant climatic response to astronomical forcing during the Cenozoic (Fig. 3). We find that the prevailing climate state as characterized by atmospheric CO2 concentration and polar ice sheets seems to orchestrate the response and impact of climate processes to astronomical forcing. Modeled insolation-driven global temperature variability on astronomical time scales suggest that different temperature response regimes exist: eccentricity dominates temperature responses in low latitudes, precession in mid latitudes and obliquity in high latitudes (25). Thus, pronounced astronomical cyclicity in the CENOGRID could reflect climate-state dependent amplifications of latitude-specific climate processes.The CENOGRID allows us to scrutinize the state-dependency of climate system response to CO2 and astronomical forcing on ten thousand to one million year time scales (13).

        <p>In the Hothouse and Warmhouse, as well as the first Coolhouse phase, eccentricity-related cycles dominate the CENOGRID indicating a strong influence of low-latitude processes on climate variations. Obliquity-related cycles are sparse in these intervals, but have been documented in other geochemical records (26,27) exhibiting perhaps local lithological responses. Weak response in the obliquity-band during the Hothouse and Warmhouse intervals might be related to the absence of a high-latitude ice sheet that could have amplified climate response to obliquity forcing. The driving mechanism for the prevailing eccentricity cyclicity in the benthic δ 13 C and δ 18 O records is still unknown, but modeling suggests that low-and mid-latitude processes in the climate system respond in a non-linear way to insolation forcing (25,(28)(29)(30). In this regard, a key feedback likely involves the hydrological cycle with highly seasonal precipitation patterns during intervals of strong monsoon response to precession-induced insolation change which could play a major role in the global distribution of moisture and energy (31)(32)(33)(34). The expression of precession is apparently weak in the CENOGRID composite record despite the dominant eccentricity forcing, likely due to the long residence time of carbon in the oceans enhancing longer forcing periods (30,35), as well as our strategy to avoid 'overtuning' the record.In the Hothouse and Warmhouse, as well as the first Coolhouse phase, eccentricity-related cycles dominate the CENOGRID indicating a strong influence of low-latitude processes on climate variations.

        <p>Following the increasing influence of high latitude cooling and ice growth during the second Coolhouse phase, the obliquity-band response steadily increases after the mMCT before dominating climate dynamics by the late Miocene-early Pliocene (11,22,36). In the Icehouse state, the progressive decrease in atmospheric CO2 and major growth of polar ice sheets, which enhanced variability in δ 18 O, steadily amplified the influence of complex high latitude feedbacks until they essentially dominate climate dynamics.Following the increasing influence of high latitude cooling and ice growth during the second Coolhouse phase, the obliquity-band response steadily increases after the mMCT before dominating climate dynamics by the late Miocene-early Pliocene (11,22,36).

        <p>To better understand the complexity of climate dynamics recorded in the CENOGRID, we computed the RA measure of determinism (DET, (13)). This parameter quantifies the predictability of dynamics in a system's state. Predictability estimates the stochastic (unpredictable) versus the deterministic (predictable) nature of climate dynamics recorded in CENOGRID (13). DET values near zero correspond to unpredictable dynamics, whereas large values indicate predictable dynamics, which are especially interesting to examine on the approach to tipping points. Changes in DET can thus reveal transitions between fundamentally different climate regimes.To better understand the complexity of climate dynamics recorded in the CENOGRID, we computed the RA measure of determinism (DET, (13)).

        <p>The growth of polar ice sheets at the EOT enhanced the effect of obliquity pacing of high latitude climate that interacted with eccentricity-modulated precession forcing at lower latitudes from that point in time. This led to increased non-linear interactions among astronomically paced climate processes, and thus more complex, stochastic climate dynamics. The development of large Antarctic ice volume at the inception of the Coolhouse is associated with a fundamental regime change towards less predictable climate variability (lower DET values calculated from benthic δ 18 O, Fig. 3). From 25 to 13.9 Ma DET is elevated again, related to a reduction in ice volume in relatively warmer times of the Coolhouse, culminating in the MCO. Despite the growing influence of ice sheets in the Coolhouse, until ~6 to 7 Ma carbon cycle dynamics remain more deterministic than temperature because δ 13 C variations are predominantly driven by lowlatitude processes and less strongly influenced by the complex interaction with polar ice-sheet fluctuations. After ~6 Ma DET drops likely due to stronger cryosphere imprint on the carbon cycle. Upon initiation of the Icehouse at 3.3 Ma, δ 18 O recorded climate dynamics become slightly more deterministic (37) and carbon cycle dynamics unpredictable, likely resulting from the complex response to the waxing and waning of polar caps (38).The growth of polar ice sheets at the EOT enhanced the effect of obliquity pacing of high latitude climate that interacted with eccentricity-modulated precession forcing at lower latitudes from that point in time.

        <p>The CENOGRID spectrogram displays a broader frequency range during several intervals with low DET values (e.g., Coolhouse), while high DET values (e.g., Warmhouse) occur when single frequencies dominate (Fig. 3). This could be signaling a more direct response to astronomical forcing in the Warmhouse compared to the Coolhouse. Our RA suggests that the Hothouse is more stochastic (less predictable) than the Warmhouse, presumably induced by the occurrence of extreme hyperthermal events and their strong non-linear and much amplified climate response to astronomical forcing (39,40). The evolving pattern in the DET from the onset of cooling after the EECO to the EOT is striking (Fig. 3). The amplitude in fluctuations between stochastic and deterministic dynamics intensifies from 49 Ma to 34 Ma, consistent with how Earth's climate system is suggested to behave (41,42) as it moves towards a major tipping point. Once that tipping point is reached at the EOT, a rapid shift toward more permanently stochastic dynamics marks the inception of a new climate state (43). Thus polar ice volume is not only critical to defining Earth's fundamental climate state, it also seems to play a critical role in determining the predictability of its climatological response to astronomical forcing. If climate dynamics have similar patterns they will show up as darker areas in the plot, if they have no common dynamics the plot will remain white. Four distinct climate states can be identified as Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, and Icehouse with distinct transitions among them. The relation of oxygen isotopes, representative for average global temperature trends, to atmospheric CO2 concentrations suggests that the present climate system as of today (415 ppm CO2) is comparable to the Miocene Coolhouse close to the Miocene Climate Optimum. If CO2 emissions continue unmitigated until 2100 as assumed for the RCP8.5 scenario, the Earth climate system will be moved abruptly from the Icehouse into the Warmhouse or even Hothouse climate state. Fig. 3. Quasi-periodic changes and determinism in the global reference carbon cycle and oxygen isotope record. Evolutionary FFT spectrogram, recurrence determinism analysis and benthic foraminifer oxygen (A) and carbon (B) isotope data plotted on age with the four climate states. Frequencies between two and sixty cycles per million years are related to changes in Earth's orbital parameters, known as Milankovitch cycles. The FFT spectrograms were computed with a 5-Myr window on the detrended records of benthic carbon and oxygen isotope data. From 67 to 13.9 Ma cyclic variations in global climate are dominated by the 405-and 100kyr eccentricity cycles. Thereafter, in particular in the oxygen isotope record, the influence of obliquity increased, dominating the rhythm of climate in the record younger than ~7.7 million years. Recurrence analysis of determinism (DET) shows that climate in the Warmhouse state is more deterministic (predictable) than in the Hot-, Cool-and Icehouse. From 47 Ma towards the Eocene-Oligocene Transition at 34 Ma climate dynamic changes are rising in amplitudeThe CENOGRID spectrogram displays a broader frequency range during several intervals with low DET values (e.g., Coolhouse), while high DET values (e.g., Warmhouse) occur when single frequencies dominate (Fig. 3).

Thereafter, in particular in the oxygen isotope record, the influence of obliquity increased, dominating the rhythm of climate in the record younger than ~7.7 million years. Recurrence analysis of determinism (DET) shows that climate in the Warmhouse state is more deterministic (predictable) than in the Hot-, Cool-and Icehouse. From 47 Ma towards the Eocene-Oligocene Transition at 34 Ma climate dynamic changes are rising in amplitude</p>
