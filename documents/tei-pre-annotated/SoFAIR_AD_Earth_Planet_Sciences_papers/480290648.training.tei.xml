        <p>present knowledge of Late triassic tetrapod evolution, including the rise of dinosaurs, relies heavily on the fossil-rich continental deposits of South America, their precise depositional histories and correlations. We report on an extended succession of the ischigualasto formation exposed in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas (La Rioja, Argentina), where more than 100 tetrapod fossils were newly collected, augmented by historical finds such as the ornithosuchid Venaticosuchus rusconii and the putative ornithischian Pisanosaurus mertii. Detailed lithostratigraphy combined with high-precision U-Pb geochronology from three intercalated tuffs are used to construct a robust Bayesian age model for the formation, constraining its deposition between 230.2 ± 1.9 Ma and 221.4 ± 1.2 Ma, and its fossil-bearing interval to 229.20 + 0.11/-0.15-226.85 + 1.45/-2.01 Ma. The latter is divided into a lower Hyperodapedon and an upper Teyumbaita biozones, based on the ranges of the eponymous rhynchosaurs, allowing biostratigraphic correlations to elsewhere in the ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin, as well as to the paraná Basin in Brazil. the temporally calibrated ischigualasto biostratigraphy suggests the persistence of rhynchosaur-dominated faunas into the earliest Norian. Our ca. 229 Ma age assignment to Pi. mertii partially fills the ghost lineage between younger ornithischian records and the oldest known saurischians at ca. 233 Ma.present knowledge of Late triassic tetrapod evolution, including the rise of dinosaurs, relies heavily on the fossil-rich continental deposits of South America, their precise depositional histories and correlations.

        <p>www.nature.com/scientificreports/ With one of the richest land biotas recorded worldwide, the Ischigualasto Formation of north-western Argentina represents a unique "window" into Late Triassic biodiversity and evolution. This stratigraphic unit is well known from the Ischigualasto Provincial Park (IPP), San Juan Province, with a fossil record composed of plants, fishes, and most of the known tetrapod groups of the time, i.e., temnospondyls, rhynchosaurs, archosauriforms (including dinosaurs), dicynodonts, and cynodonts [1][2][3] . Radioisotopic dates of various vintages have given the Ischigualasto fauna a temporal context, elevating its global significance in understanding the Triassic land ecosystems, as well as the early evolution of dinosaurs 3 . Nevertheless, exposures of the Ischigualasto Formation outside the IPP have only been briefly explored, delivering only subordinate fossil records 3 . One exception is the site known as Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas [4][5][6] in La Rioja Province, where the northernmost known outcrops of the formation are exposed (Fig. 1; see also fig. 1 in Baczko et al. 7 ). Explored by several expeditions starting in the early sixties (see Historical background and motivation in the Supplementary Information), the fossil record of the area appears meagre compared to that of the IPP and it has been described as "a poorly fossiliferous outcrop" (p. 20 in Martínez et al. 3 ), but includes key specimens, such as the holotypes of the ornithosuchid Venaticosuchus rusconii and the probable ornithischian Pisanosaurus mertii.www.nature.com/scientificreports/ With one of the richest land biotas recorded worldwide, the Ischigualasto Formation of north-western Argentina represents a unique "window" into Late Triassic biodiversity and evolution.

        <p>Aiming to expand the fossil collections of the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas and to investigate the chronostratigraphic context of previous fossil collections, our team explored the Cerro Las Lajas area in the course of four expeditions from 2013 to 2019. Here, we report on more than 100 new tetrapod fossil specimens collected form the Ischigualasto Formation at Cerro Las Lajas. Detail stratigraphy of its over 1,000 m-thick succession, integrated with high-precision U-Pb zircon geochronology of three interlayered tuffs, provide a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework for the Ischigualasto Formation in the the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas. In this context, we discuss palaeobiologic aspects of the Ischigualasto fauna and their implications for Late Triassic tetrapod evolution. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Stratigraphy. The section studied here is located in the "hoyada" (depression) positioned to the east of Cerro Las Lajas, southwest of the town of Villa Unión in the western La Rioja Province (Fig. 1). The lowlands of Cerro Las Lajas expose a 1,059 m-thick succession of predominantly greyish to tan siliciclastic rocks with an average dip of 30° east that belong to the Ischigualasto Formation. Floodplain siltstones and (mottled) mudstones, channel sandstones and conglomerates, and a variety of tuffs and tuffaceous sediments form the bulk of the formation. To the east, the top of the Ischigualsto succession is in transitional contact with the overlying red sandstones of the Los Colorados Formation (Figs. 2 and3). The base of the succession to the west is juxtaposed against outcrops of the (younger) Los Colorados Formation via a steep, N-S trending fault. Discontinuous exposures of the underlying, greenish-grey Los Rastros Formation rocks occur along the fault zone, with complex stratigraphic relationships to the basal Ischigualasto strata at our measured section (see Supplementary Information). Elsewhere in the area and away from the faults, the conformable contact between the Los Rastros and Ischigualasto formations is well documented. These confirm the near-complete nature of the Ischigualasto succession exposed at the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas.Aiming to expand the fossil collections of the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas and to investigate the chronostratigraphic context of previous fossil collections, our team explored the Cerro Las Lajas area in the course of four expeditions from 2013 to 2019.

        <p>The succession of the Ischigualasto Formation exposed at Cerro Las Lajas is subdivided into three sections based on lithologic characteristics and alluvial depositional facies (Fig. 2) (see Supplementary Information). The lower section extending from the contact with the Los Rastros Formation-at 11 m above base (mab) of the profile in Fig. 2-to 310 mab was formed by a meandering fluvial system developed in a broad floodplain depositional setting. This section exposes an isolated, greyish-white, tuff marker bed ('Toba-2') up to 2 m-thick at 107 mab (i.e., 96 m above the base of the Ischigualasto Formation), which could provides a direct correlation point to the Ischigualasto Formation at the IPP (Herr Toba bentonite; see below). The majority of the fossils discovered in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas occur above the tuff marker and are restricted to the lower section, with the largest concentration of fossils (main fossil zone) occurring between 240 and 300 mab (Figs. 2 and3). The middle section (310-740 mab) marks an increase in accommodation together with fewer fossiliferous beds and more pedogenic features indicative of higher humidity conditions. The upper section (740-1,070 mab) is characterized by the transition from a meandering to a braided fluvial system concomitant with increased pyroclastic activity in the form of prominent welded tuff (ignimbrite) beds (Fig. 3e and Fig. S3d-e). The upper section is essentially currently fossil-free and extends to the base of the overlying Los Colorados Formation. The well-recognized and conformable contact between the two formations provides another correlation point between the Cerro Las Lajas succession and that of the IPP.

        <p>Our new age model based on a set of high-precision U-Pb dates from the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas (Fig. 4; Table 1 and Table S2) provides a reliable chronostratigraphic framework for the Ischigualasto Formation and its Late Triassic vertebrate fauna. Accordingly, the base of the Ischigualasto Formation is constrained at 230.23 + 1.88/-0.86 Ma. Caution must be made, however, in interpreting this age, as the limited outcrops of the underlying Los Rastros Formation at the measured section have a complex stratigraphy due to faulting (for further information, see above and the Supplementary Information). Our age model places the conformable Ischigualasto-Los Colorados formation boundary with a high degree of confidence at 221.36 + 0.44/-1.31 Ma.Our new age model based on a set of high-precision U-Pb dates from the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas (Fig. 4; Table 1 and Table S2) provides a reliable chronostratigraphic framework for the Ischigualasto Formation and its Late Triassic vertebrate fauna.

        <p>Vertebrate fossils at the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas have so far been limited to the lower part of the Ischigualasto Formation (lower and middle sections), from ~ 115 to 400 mab. The fossil record starts shortly above the dated 'Toba-2' tuff marker at 229.25 ± 0.10/0.16/0.30 Ma; a stratigraphic relationship that mimics that of the Herr Toba bentonite at IPP 3,8 . The main fossil concentration, however, occurs between 240 and 300 mab www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (Figs. 2 and5), which is constrained in time between 228.10 + 0.72/-1.50 and 227.61 + 1.04/-1.79 Ma, based on our Bayesian age model. As such, it roughly coincides with the extrapolated age of the Carnian-Norian stage boundary, which has been indirectly calibrated at ~ 227 Ma (updated) 9 or ~ 228.4 Ma 10 .Vertebrate fossils at the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas have so far been limited to the lower part of the Ischigualasto Formation (lower and middle sections), from ~ 115 to 400 mab.

        <p>fossil provenance. Consistent with observations in José Bonaparte field notes and photographs (see details in Supplementary Materials), the fossiliferous beds at the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas are mostly concentrated in the lower third of the studied succession, between 100 and 400 mab (Figs. 2 and5). The lowermost recovered fossil corresponds to the aetosaur Aetosauroides scagliai (CRILAR-Pv 580) that occurs at 115 mab (Figs. 2 and5). Further upsection, a specimen representing a new species of the rhynchosaur Hyperodapedon (CRILAR-Pv 585) was collected in brown mudstones, near a specimen of the cynodont Exaeretodon sp. (CRILAR-Pv 672) at about 120-125 mab. Hyperodapedon sanjuanensis also occurred as isolated finds at 140 (CRILAR-Pv 646) and 175 (CRILAR-Pv 584) mab.fossil provenance.

        <p>The zone of main fossil concentration (240-300 mab) starts with indeterminate rhynchosaur records (CRI-LAR-Pv 675, 687) and H. sanjuanensis (CRILAR-Pv 583), with the uppermost record of that genus and species (CRILAR-Pv 650) occurring near 260 mab. This is slightly below the lowest record, at 265 mab, of Teyumbaita (CRILAR-Pv 592, 643) in the succession. The latter genus accounts for fourteen out of the twenty fossil specimens identified at the genus level in this 60 m interval, also occurring as high as 350 mab. The range of Exaeretodon spans across that main fossil zone, but with a lower abundance (three specimens).

        <p>Of the specimens referred to Exaeretodon, the most complete cranial material belongs to CRILAR-Pv 647 (Fig. 6), but it is badly preserved. It corresponds to a small-sized skull, with an estimated skull length of ~ 20 cm. It is fragmented in three pieces, including: (1) part of the left portions of snout, orbit, the postorbital bar, the zygomatic arch and the parietal crest (Fig. 6a); (2) part of the right zygomatic arch, with the anteroventral edge of the orbit and the ventral base of the postorbital bar (Fig. 6b); and (3) part of the palate including portions of maxillae with poorly preserved posterior postcanines, palatines, and pterygoids. As in other specimens of Exaeretodon (e.g., MACN-Pv 18125; Bonaparte 16 ), the zygomatic arch is deep with the anterior process of the squamosal anteriorly extended almost to the level of the postorbital bar and there is a well-developed descending process of the jugal below the orbit (Fig. 6c). The orbit (preserved only in the left side) is relatively www.nature.com/scientificreports/ large, in accordance with the small, sub-adult size of the skull, and it faces mostly dorsally due to taphonomic dorsoventral compression (Fig. 6a). The parietal crest is incomplete, but appears to have been well-developed. The palatal area is poorly preserved, with the primary palate exposed lateral to the last postcanine teeth as in other traversodontids 16,17 , due to the presence of an axially short secondary palate. The crown morphology of the upper postcanines is difficult to access, but it is typically divided in two (labial and lingual) lobes, with an occlusal basin, and an extensive "V" shaped shouldering.Of the specimens referred to Exaeretodon, the most complete cranial material belongs to CRILAR-Pv 647 (Fig. 6), but it is badly preserved.

        <p>The mandibular elements and lower dentition are also poorly preserved (Fig. 6d-f). A right dentary fragment preserves two postcanines and the crypt for a posterior one (possibly in process of eruption at the moment of death). That dentary preserves part of its straight ventral edge, the anterior end of the masseteric fossa, and the base of the coronoid process (Fig. 6d). The masseteric fossa seems to be well-developed and reaches the level of the last functional postcanine. The base of the coronoid process is robust and laterally covers the crypt in the area where postcanines are added to the tooth row during ontogeny (Fig. 6f). Another dentary fragment only holds a left postcanine and part of the root of the posterior one.The mandibular elements and lower dentition are also poorly preserved (Fig. 6d-f). A right dentary fragment preserves two postcanines and the crypt for a posterior one (possibly in process of eruption at the moment of death).

        <p>The lower postcanine teeth of CRILAR-Pv 647 have the typical shape observed in Exaeretodon (e.g., MACN-Pv 18125) 18,19 . They are subquadrangular in occlusal view, with a deep central occlusal basin surrounded by four cusps placed at each corner (Fig. 6e). The mesiolabial cusp is the largest and both mesial cusps (mesiolabial and mesiolingual) are in a higher position relative to the distal ones, forming a mesial cutting edge slightly apicodistally inclined (Fig. 6e,f). The crown is relatively low and surrounded by a thick layer of enamel, which does not cover the occlusal surface. The limit between crown and root is not marked by a neck, but by the edge of the enamel layer. The root of each tooth is conical and tapers toward the apex. The apex is distally curved (Fig. 6f) as typical of Exaeretodon (UFRGS-PV 1096-T) 20 , as the result of the tooth replacement.The lower postcanine teeth of CRILAR-Pv 647 have the typical shape observed in Exaeretodon (e.g., MACN-Pv 18125) 18,19 .

        <p>There are two partially preserved canines of small size in CRILAR-Pv 647, which are interpreted as lower elements. Their crown is sub-conical, slightly labio-lingually flattened, and well curved distally. The incisors are represented by three crown fragments of small size. One is attached to the palate fragment and the other two are isolated. They have the labial surface strongly convex and the lingual one flat to slightly convex, with the crown slightly curved lingually.There are two partially preserved canines of small size in CRILAR-Pv 647, which are interpreted as lower elements.

        <p>Comments. The specimens of Exaeretodon from the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas are fragmentary and poorly preserved in comparison to those discovered at the Hoyada de Ischigualasto, in San Juan Province 2,3,16 . Only CRI-LAR-Pv 647, which is still under preparation (and will be described elsewhere), includes a well preserved postcranium, but apparently lacks cranial elements. Moreover, cynodonts are not as abundant as archosauromorphs (mainly rhynchosaurs) in the area and are taxonomically restricted so far to the traversodontid Exaeretodon.Comments.

        <p>Exaeretodon was first described 25 based on specimens collected in the Hoyada de Ischigualasto.

        <p>Presently, the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas specimens can be clearly assigned to the genus Exaeretodon. Nonetheless, the lack of complete skulls precludes the evaluation of features that may distinguish between Ex. argentinus and Ex. riograndensis, such as the prootic crests and the postcanine variation along ontogeny. Also, amongst the specimens traditionally referred to Exaeretodon from the Hoyada de Ischigualasto, two different morphotypes were recently briefly communicated 24 , one of which seems to be closely related to the recently described traversodontid Siriusgnathus niemeyerorum from the Candelária Sequence of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil 25 . The specimens collected in La Rioja do not have the combination of features observed in Sir. niemeyerorum (CAPPA/UFSM 0032), e.g., a very reduced suborbital process of the jugal 25 .

        <p>Comments. These specimens can be referred to Hyperdapedontinae because of the presence of the following synapomorphies 34 : mandible dorsoventral depth &gt; 0.25 times its total length (CRILAR-Pv 583); dentary with mesiodistally compressed teeth (all specimens); posteriormost dentary teeth on the posterior half of the lower jaw (CRILAR-Pv 583); and astragalus with centrale facet greater than the tibial facet (CRILAR-Pv 584, although this condition is unknown in the immediate sister-taxa to Hyperodapedontinae). In addition, CRILAR-Pv 584 can be included in the Hyperodapedon clade 44 because of the presence of a maxillary tooth plate with more than two tooth rows in the LTBA and four or more tooth rows on its anterior half. Within Hyperodapedontinae, these specimens can be referred to H. sanjuanensis because the absence of lingual teeth in the dentary has been considered an autapomorphy of this species 38 . Nevertheless, the unnamed Nova Scotia hyperodapedontine apparently also lacks lingual dentary teeth 37 and this feature may be an apomorphy of a more inclusive clade of hyperodapedontines (i.e. H. sanjuanensis + North American forms 34 ). We preferred here to maintain this character-state as diagnostic of H. sanjuanensis until more information of the Nova Scotia hyperodapedontine is published. In any case, the maxillary tooth plate of CRILAR-Pv 584 differs from those of the Nova Scotia hyperodapedontine in the presence of a higher number of tooth rows in the LTBA and, at least for this specimen, such combination of character-states still supports its referral to H. sanjuanensis.

No secondary anguli oris crest is present on the main body of the jugal, contrasting with Te. sulcognathus 41 and I. genovefae 45 . The lateral surface of the posterior process of the jugal of CRILAR-Pv 585 lacks the deep and posterodorsally well-rimmed depression located on the ventral half of the base of this process in H. huxleyi (ISIR 01), H. huenei (UFRGS-PV 0132T), and referred specimens of H. mariensis (UFRGS-PV 0149T).

        <p>The palatine of CRILAR-Pv 585 contacts the ectopterygoid posterolaterally and, as a result, excludes the maxilla from the border of the infraorbital foramen. The pterygoid possesses a cup-shaped, dorsomedially projected process that received the basipterygoid process of the parabasisphenoid.

        <p>The scapula is anteroposteriorly expanded at both the proximal and distal ends (Fig. 7i).

        <p>Comments. CRILAR-Pv 585 is identified as a hyperodapedontine rhynchosaur because of the presence of the following synapomorphies of the clade 34 : jugal without an elevated orbital rim; fully closed lower temporal bar; anguli oris crest extended onto the anterior process of the jugal, but not the maxilla; maxilla well laterally overlapped by the jugal; maxillary tooth plate with cushion-shaped LTBA; and maxillary teeth with conical and 'pyramidal' crowns. In addition, CRILAR-Pv 585 shares with other members of the Hyperodapedon clade the following synapomorphies 34 : maxillary tooth plate with more than two tooth rows in the MTBA; maxillary tooth plate with four or more tooth rows of occlusal teeth on its anterior half; parabasisphenoid with a basipterygoid process wider than long (inferred from the shape of the basal articulation on the pterygoid); and postaxial cervical postzygapophyses with crest-shaped epipophysis. Among hyperodapedontines, CRILAR-Pv 585 differs from other taxa in the presence of an autapomorphic row of ventrally oriented lingual teeth restricted to the anterior half of the maxillary tooth plate. This new species will be formally named and described in detail in a future contribution.Comments.

        <p>The maxilla of CRILAR-Pv 582 is represented by the middle portion of the tooth plate. The occlusal surface of the bone is subdivided by a single, medially displaced longitudinal groove, as occurs in H. sanjuanensis, H. mariensis, the holotype of H. tikiensis, H. huxleyi, Su. stockleyi and I. genovefae 32,34,38,49 . By contrast, the longitudinal groove is centred on the tooth plate in H. gordoni, the above Hyperodapedon sp. nov., and an indeterminate hyperodapedontine from the Ischigualasto Formation 40 . The longitudinal groove narrows anteriorly, resembling the condition in some other hyperodapedontines (e.g. UFRGS-PV 0149T, 0408T). The longitudinal groove bows slightly laterally and is very deep, with a V-shaped cross-section. The LTBA possesses four longitudinal tooth rows and the MTBA has three rows. The presence of more lateral longitudinal tooth rows than medial ones is consistent with the condition in H. sanjuanensis (MACN-Pv 18185, MCP-PV 1693), H. mariensis (UFRGS-PV 0149T, 0408T), H. huxleyi (ISIR 01), and the holotype of H. tikiensis 33 . By contrast, the MTBA has more longitudinal tooth rows than the lateral one in H. gordoni 39 , Su. stockleyi (SAM-PK-11705), and the unnamed hyperodapedontine from Nova Scotia 37 . The preserved L1 and M1 tooth crowns are strongly worn on the walls of the longitudinal groove, exposing the root in coronal section. The teeth of both toothbearing areas are relatively small and closely packed, as occurs in most hyperodapedontines with the exception of I. genovefae 35,45 . The preserved tooth crowns of both tooth-bearing areas have a circular cross-section, but it is not possible to determine the presence of pyramidal teeth because the posterior region of the tooth plate is not preserved. The preserved portion of the medial surface of the bone lacks lingual teeth, but it not possible to determine if they were present more posteriorly or anteriorly in the tooth plate. The fragment of dentary of CRILAR-Pv 582 possesses a V-shaped cross-section as a result of the presence of a transversely thin and sharp occlusal cutting blade.

        <p>The maxillary tooth plate of the currently largest specimen of Teyumbaita sp. nov. has a transverse width of 47.6 mm (CRILAR-Pv 587), which is ca. 84% smaller than the largest specimen of Te. sulcognathus (transverse width = 56.7 mm, UFRGS-PV 290T). The maxillary tooth plate possesses two longitudinal grooves that define three tooth bearing areas (Fig. 8g), as occurs in Te. sulcognathus 41 , H. huenei 29 , the morphotype 2 of H. tikiensis 33 , and several non-hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurids 43,51 . The lateral groove is considered homologous to the single longitudinal sulcus of most hyperodapedontines (Chatterjee 52 and subsequent authors). As a result, the MTBA is subdivided into a central medial tooth bearing area (cMTBA) and an inner medial tooth bearing area (iMTBA). The entire MTBA is broader than the LTBA, as is the case in Te. sulcognathus and H. huenei 29,41 , but it contrasts with the distinctly broader LTBA present in both morphotypes of H. tikiensis 33 . Both longitudinal grooves converge anteriorly at the anterior third of the maxilla of Teyumbaita sp. nov., resembling the condition in Te. sulcognathus and the morphotype 2 of H. tikiensis 33,41 , but the medial groove is restricted to the posterior third of the tooth plate in H. huenei 29 .The maxillary tooth plate of the currently largest specimen of Teyumbaita sp. nov. has a transverse width of 47.6 mm (CRILAR-Pv 587), which is ca. 84% smaller than the largest specimen of Te. sulcognathus (transverse width = 56.7 mm, UFRGS-PV 290T). The maxillary tooth plate possesses two longitudinal grooves that define three tooth bearing areas (Fig. 8g), as occurs in Te. sulcognathus 41 , H. huenei 29 , the morphotype 2 of H. tikiensis 33 , and several non-hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurids 43,51 . The lateral groove is considered homologous to the single longitudinal sulcus of most hyperodapedontines (Chatterjee 52 and subsequent authors). As a result, the MTBA is subdivided into a central medial tooth bearing area (cMTBA) and an inner medial tooth bearing area (iMTBA). The entire MTBA is broader than the LTBA, as is the case in Te. sulcognathus and H. huenei 29,41 , but it contrasts with the distinctly broader LTBA present in both morphotypes of H. tikiensis 33 . Both longitudinal grooves converge anteriorly at the anterior third of the maxilla of Teyumbaita sp. nov., resembling the condition in Te. sulcognathus and the morphotype 2 of H. tikiensis 33,41 , but the medial groove is restricted to the posterior third of the tooth plate in H. huenei 29 .</p>
        <p>The number of tooth rows in the LTBA, cMTBA, and iMTBA show minor variation among preserved specimens. The LTBA and cMTBA have two longitudinal tooth rows posteriorly, and the iMTBA has two (CRILAR-Pv 587, 642, 643) or three to four (CRILAR-Pv 588) tooth rows on the posterior half of the tooth plate. The arrangement of these occlusal tooth rows resembles that of Te. sulcognathus 41 . In addition, there is a row of well-spaced lingual teeth immediately medial to the cushion-shaped iMTBA (Fig. 8c,g). This row of lingual teeth extends from the posterior end up to the posterior third (CRILAR-Pv 588, 642) or approximately the mid-length (CRILAR-Pv 587, 595) of the tooth plate and is composed of up to eleven teeth (CRILAR-Pv 587). By contrast, Te. sulcognathus possesses a single lingual tooth positioned on the posteromedial corner of the bone 41 . The lingual teeth of Teyumbaita sp. nov. are ventrally oriented, resembling the condition in Hyperodaperdon sp. nov. (CRILAR-Pv 585), but contrasting with H. huenei 29 and the Zimbabwean hyperodapedontine 36 .The number of tooth rows in the LTBA, cMTBA, and iMTBA show minor variation among preserved specimens.

        <p>In the braincase, the ventral ends of the exoccipitals contact their counterparts on the floor of the endocranial cavity (Fig. 8e,f), as occurs in most other hyperodapedontines (see above), but contrasting with the absence of such contact in Te. sulcognathus 41 . The parabasisphenoid has an oblique, posterodorsally to anteroventrally oriented, main axis in lateral view. The basipterygoid processes are dorsoventrally taller than transversely broad, as in other hyperodapedontines with the exception of I. genovefae 45 .In the braincase, the ventral ends of the exoccipitals contact their counterparts on the floor of the endocranial cavity (Fig. 8e,f), as occurs in most other hyperodapedontines (see above), but contrasting with the absence of such contact in Te. sulcognathus 41 .

        <p>The dentary has a lateral cutting blade and a lower and transversely thicker medial cutting blade, as occurs in Te. sulcognathus and non-hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurids 41 . Multiple lingual teeth are located on the top of the medial blade, immediately medial to it, and on a medially bulged border, being disposed in a crowded pattern, resembling the condition in Te. sulcognathus 41 , but differing from the well-spaced lingual teeth of H. huenei 29 and several other hyperodapedontines (e.g. H. mariensis, MCN 1867-PV).The dentary has a lateral cutting blade and a lower and transversely thicker medial cutting blade, as occurs in Te. sulcognathus and non-hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurids 41 .

        <p>The morphology of the atlas (Fig. 8h) closely resembles that of Te. sulcognathus 46 and other hyperodapedontines (e.g. H. huxleyi 32 ). The dorsal margin of the neural spine of the axis possesses a strongly convex central portion in lateral view that becomes concave at the level of the postzygapophyses, resembling the condition in H. gordoni 39 . By contrast, the posterior portion of the dorsal margin of the axial neural spine of Te. sulcognathus 46 (UFRGS-PV 0232T, 0298T) is convex in lateral view. The postaxial cervical vertebrae have a relatively short centrum with a thick, ventral keel. The postzygapophyses have a stout, crest-like epipophysis that vary in the series from short structures that do not extend posteriorly beyond the postzygapophyseal facet to substantially longer epipophyses, as occurs in Te. sulcognathus 46 . The best preserved dorsal vertebra has a spool-shaped centrum without a ventral keel (Fig. 8i).

        <p>The scapula has a broad and fan-shaped blade, more anteriorly than posteriorly expanded (Fig. 8j). By contrast, the posterior margin of the scapular blade is nearly straight in Te. sulcognathus 46 . The acromial process is well-raised from the rest of the bone and mainly laterally projected, resembling the condition in some other hyperodapedontines (e.g. H. huxleyi, ISIR 01), whereas in Te. sulcognathus this process is shorter and blunt 46 . The humeral entepicondyle lacks the autapomorphic well-developed longitudinal groove of Te. sulcognathus 46 . The ectepicondyle has a tall supinator ridge and shallow ligament groove, which are mainly proximodistally oriented (Fig. 8k), as is the case in Te. sulcognathus 46 , H. gordoni (Benton 1983), and Hyperodapedon sp. nov. (CRILAR-Pv 585). By contrast, these ridge and groove are oblique, posteroproximally to anterodistally oriented, in H. sanjuanensis (MACN-Pv 18185) and H. huxleyi 32 . The ulna lacks an olecranon process and has a subtriangular lateral tuber in proximal view (Fig. 8l).

        <p>Most of the specimens (CRILAR-Pv 589-593, 597, 598) here referred to Teyumbaita sp. are represented by partial, generally isolated, maxillae with two longitudinal grooves that extend anteriorly beyond the posterior third of the tooth plate and, thus, can be referred to this genus 41 . However, the presence of the row of lingual teeth that is diagnostic of Teyumbaita sp. nov. cannot be determined in these specimens because of damage or lack of preservation.

        <p>The right maxilla of CRILAR-Pv 579 is fairly complete, with a damaged anterior end, and preserved in articulation with the anterior process of the jugal. The anterior process of the maxilla extends a long way anteriorly to the antorbital fenestra, has a subhorizontal dorsal slope, and is strongly ornamented on its external surface (Fig. 9a). The premaxillary contact, at the anterior margin of the process, is not preserved. The ascending process forms the anterodorsal margin of the antorbital fenestra. The transition between the anterior and ascending processes is gradual, forming an obtuse angle, similar to the condition of Ch. bonapartei and Ps. ischigualastensis. As in Proterochampsa nodosa and Pro. barrionuevoi, the antorbital fossa excavates only the ascending process of the maxilla, where it forms a broad, anteriorly rounded depression. The palatal process is dorsoventrally low, forming the lateral and anterior borders of the internal nares (Fig. 9b). The ventral surface of this process bears some, possibly neurovascular, small foramina, as well as some striated areas for probably soft tissue attachment. Its dorsal surface is smooth, and slightly convex. The posterior process of the maxilla is laterally overlapped and excluded from most of the external ventral border of the antorbital fenestra by the jugal (Fig. 9a). In contrast, the maxilla forms most of the ventral border of the antorbital fenestra in other proterochampsids. The antorbital fenestra is mainly dorsally oriented, unlike the laterally facing fenestra of Tro. romeri, Cerritosaurus binsfeldi and rhadinosuchines. Ten tooth positions are preserved in the maxilla, but the total number would have been slightly higher, resembling the tooth counts of other specimens of Proterochampsa (e.g., at least 11 tooth positions in PVSJ 77 58 ). The preserved maxillary tooth crowns are relatively short and distally recurved (Fig. 9a,b). They have denticles on the apical three-quarters of the distal margin of the crown, whereas the mesial margin is not serrated. The denticles have a quadrangular edge and the interdenticular spaces do not extend onto the central region of the crown as blood grooves. There are 5 denticles per mm and they are apically oriented (Fig. 9c), contrasting with the orthogonal orientation of the maxillary denticles of other proterochampsids and the widespread condition in other archosauriforms. The apex of an erupting, mesial replacement tooth is visible between the bases of two interdental plates. The medial wall of the alveoli is formed by pentagonal interdental plates that do not contact one another (Fig. 9b). This exposes a wide groove extending along the bases of the interdental plates, with a replacement pit for each tooth 27,59 (Fig. 9b).The right maxilla of CRILAR-Pv 579 is fairly complete, with a damaged anterior end, and preserved in articulation with the anterior process of the jugal.

The preserved maxillary tooth crowns are relatively short and distally recurved (Fig. 9a,b). They have denticles on the apical three-quarters of the distal margin of the crown, whereas the mesial margin is not serrated. The denticles have a quadrangular edge and the interdenticular spaces do not extend onto the central region of the crown as blood grooves. There are 5 denticles per mm and they are apically oriented (Fig. 9c), contrasting with the orthogonal orientation of the maxillary denticles of other proterochampsids and the widespread condition in other archosauriforms. The apex of an erupting, mesial replacement tooth is visible between the bases of two interdental plates. The medial wall of the alveoli is formed by pentagonal interdental plates that do not contact one another (Fig. 9b). This exposes a wide groove extending along the bases of the interdental plates, with a replacement pit for each tooth 27,59 (Fig. 9b).</p>

The preserved portion of dentary bears five alveoli, which are oval and anteroposteriorly longer than broad, and three teeth in situ with different degrees of eruption. The dentary tooth crowns have a serrated distal carina, whereas the mesial one lacks serrations, as occurs in the maxillary teeth. There are 6 denticles per mm in the dentary teeth.

        <p>Four vertebral centra were recovered, the best preserved of which belongs to an anterior or mid-cervical vertebra because its ventral surface bears a well developed longitudinal keel and the parapophyses are located slightly above the mid-height and adjacent to the anterior margin of the centrum (Fig. 9g,h). The ventral keel extends along the entire length of the centrum, as also seen in cervical vertebrae of Ps. ischigualastensis and Ch. bonapartei. The centrum is approximately as tall as long in lateral view (Fig. 9g), differing from the longer than tall cervical vertebrae of Ps. ischigualastensis.

        <p>Comments. CRILAR-Pv 599 can be referred to Paracrocodylomorpha, in particular the clade composed of Saurosuchus galilei + Crocodylomorpha, based on the following synapomorphy 81 : anteroposteriorly shortened (blade-like) basal tubera of the basioccipital. Within this group it resembles Crocodylomorpha in the absence of contact between the ventral margin of the exoccipitals. Nevertheless, this condition is also present in shuvosaurid poposauroids (Ef. okkeeffeae and Sh. inexpectatus) 71 . In this regard, there are other character states of CRILAR-Pv 599 that resembles poposauroids: vertebrae with very constricted (hourglass-shaped) centra; unexpanded distal end of neural spines; anterolateral to posteromedially compressed proximal end of femur; straight longitudinal furrow on the proximal surface of femur. By contrast, it differs from shuvosaurid poposauroids in the presence of a rounded posteromedial tuber, lower than the anteromedial one, on the proximal end of the femur. As a result, the morphology of CRILAR-Pv 599 does not completely match that of poposauroids but we refrain to unambiguously refer it to Crocodylomorpha because of its fragmentary condition and similarities with Po. gracilis. Another paracrocodylomorph is known from the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas, the crocodylomorph Trialestes romeri (PVL 3889) 75 , and although it has a congruent overlapping morphology with the vertebrae of CRILAR-Pv 599, there are no preserved diagnostic features to determine if this specimen belongs to the same species.

Particularly, the olecranon of CRILAR-Pv 580 is lateromedially compressed and sharp, resembling that of A. scagliai (PVL 2073) and Typothorax coccinarum (NMMNH-P 56299), and contrasting with that of most aetosaurs, which are wider and more rounded (St. olenkae: ZPAL AbIII/1179; Aetosaurus ferratus: SMNS 5770 S16; N. engaeus: PVL 3525). A lateral tuber for the articulation of the radius is present on the proximal end of the ulna of CRILAR-Pv 580, as in other suchians 71 .</p>

Despite its fragmentary nature, the posterior half of the distal end of the left fibula can be recognized. It has a proximodistally elongated depression on the posterior surface, delimited laterally by a sharp edge (Fig. 11n). The distal articular surface is convex and circular in cross-section. A distal fragment of metatarsal is preserved and possesses a ginglymoid articulation (Fig. 11o-q).

        <p>Numerous osteoderms are preserved in association, mainly as natural moulds. Most represent paramedian osteoderms (wider than long), there are a few ventral elements (quadrangular), and two are appendicular osteoderms (rhomboidal) (Fig. 11r-u). Their external ornamentation pattern is composed of long ridges and deep grooves that radiate from the dorsal eminence. There are some pits near this dorsal eminence as well. The characteristic anterior bar without ornamentation can be identified in some casts of paramedian osteoderms. Their internal surface is flat and unornamented. The appendicular osteoderms present a longitudinal eminence that projects from the anterior to the posterior margin and lack an anterior bar.Numerous osteoderms are preserved in association, mainly as natural moulds.

        <p>Previously reported ages from the Ischigualasto Formation at IPP were based on 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of various vintages, with tuffaceous feldspar Ar analyses spanning nearly two decades of research. The legacy 40 Ar/ 39 Ar plateau age (sanidine; incremental laser heating method) of the Herr Toba bentonite marker from the basal La Peña Member of the formation 8 was 227.78 ± 0.30 Ma (1σ analytical error only). Subsequent revisions to the 40 K decay constants and age of the fluence monitor standard used in 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology necessitated recalculation of the latter date, resulting in revised ages of 229.2 Ma 80 , 231.4 ± 0.30 Ma 2 and 230.8 ± 4.5 Ma 81 , the latter including fully propagated uncertainties (1σ) from the decay constants of 40 K. This historical age and its subsequent revisions are superseded by our new U-Pb zircon age of 229.25 ± 0.30 Ma (fully propagated 2σ uncertainty) for the correlative of the Herr Toba bentonite at Cerro Las Lajas. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology from the upper Valle de la Luna Member of the Ischigualasto Formation at IPP has been controversial due to complex age spectra of the analysed feldspars (both K-feldspar and plagioclase) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that have complicated objective pooling of the data for mean age calculation. Shipman 82 reported in an unpublished thesis a weighted mean 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 217.1 ± 3.0 Ma (2σ) with a MSWD of 14.03 from a sample ~ 70 m below the top of the formation 79 ; although the only K-feldpar analysed from this sample yielded an age of 221.9 ± 2.2 Ma. Another 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age of 225.9 ± 0.9 Ma (1σ) from a combination of plagioclase and K-feldspar analyses was reported 2 from the same stratigraphic level. Finally, the magnetostratigraphic record of the Los Colorados Formation at IPP has been interpreted to yield an age of 227 Ma 83 for the base of the formation (i.e., top of the Ischigualasto Formation). Superseding the previous 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology, our Bayesian age-stratigraphic model based on U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS geochronology yields an age of 221.4 ± 1.2 Ma for the uppermost Ischigualasto Formation. This age is in conflict with the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of Martínez et al. 2 and indicates that the magnetostratigraphic age estimate of Kent et al. 83 is inaccurate by at least 5 Myr. This also casts doubt about this age estimate of 214 Ma for the uppermost Los Colorados Formation and its fauna 83 , which could be younger based on our results.Previously reported ages from the Ischigualasto Formation at IPP were based on 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology of various vintages, with tuffaceous feldspar Ar analyses spanning nearly two decades of research.

        <p>Based on our new U-Pb geochronology, the 1059 m-thick succession of the Ischigualasto Formation at the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas was deposited in 8.8 (± 1.9) Myr, which translates into an average sediment accumulation rate of ~ 120 m/Myr.

        <p>Based on the above model, the palaeoecosystem of the Ischigualasto Formation as recorded in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas was initially characterized by a high biocenosic (life assemblages) load, represented by an abundant vertebrate association, similar to that seen in outcrops of the IPP, in San Juan Province 3 . Due to several death factors (e.g., torrential storms, increased volcanism, and biotic factors), a poor thanatocenosis phase (pre-burial death assemblage) occurred, and rapid burial factors quickly introduced the remains into the taphocenosis phase.Based on the above model, the palaeoecosystem of the Ischigualasto Formation as recorded in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas was initially characterized by a high biocenosic (life assemblages) load, represented by an abundant vertebrate association, similar to that seen in outcrops of the IPP, in San Juan Province 3 .

        <p>The middle and top levels of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas have a meagre fossil record or are almost devoid of fossils, as also observed in the IPP 3 . The reasons behind this pattern are not clear. Pyroclastic deposits, such as bentonites, ignimbrites, and welded tuffs, indicate a high volcanic influence in the area and elsewhere [87][88][89][90] . These materials are much more abundant in the upper third of the studied succession, reaching significant thicknesses in certain intervals. These volcanogenic deposits suggest proximity to volcanic centers that may have resulted in more hostile palaeoenvironments, with a reduced biomass. Yet, this is a highly conjectural inference, given that the biocenosis and thanatocenosis phases are unknown. On the other hand, the poor fossil record of these upper beds could in part be the result of lower sedimentation rates that would directly affect the taphocenosis phase, with skeletal remains being more intensely weathered, reworked, or scavenged, leading to reduced fossil preservation. Although equally extensive fossil prospecting has been carried out in the upper levels of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas, sampling biases cannot be completely ruled out as an explanation for the lack of fossils. Indeed, a combination of the above factors may explain the taphonomy of the Ischigualasto Formation and the scarcity of fossils from its upper levels.The middle and top levels of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas have a meagre fossil record or are almost devoid of fossils, as also observed in the IPP 3 .

        <p>A two-fold subdivision of the studied assemblages is, therefore, conceivable (Fig. 5), with an older fauna including Hyperodapedon, Exaeretodon, A. scagliai, and possibly Pi. mertii, occurring between 115 and 260 mab, succeeded by a younger fauna with Teyumbaita, Exaeretodon, Pro. barrionuevoi, and possibly V. rusconii and Tri. romeri, between 260 and 350 mab.

        <p>The biostratigraphic patterns recognized in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas have some resemblances to those of IPP. The cynodont Exaeretodon is the taxon with the broadest range in both areas. However, the significantly lower collection effort in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas hampers a confident estimate of the Exaeretodon range. As such, the upper ca. 700 m of the Ischigualasto Formation at the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas may be devoid of fossils in part due to insufficient sampling, although a less abundant fossil record in the upper portions of the Ischigualasto Formation is also seen in IPP and fits the taphonomic model proposed above.The biostratigraphic patterns recognized in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas have some resemblances to those of IPP.

        <p>We speculate that the replacement of Hyperodapedon by Teyumbaita at about 260 mab may not be simply a preservation artefact, in part based on the high abundance of fossils at this level. Based on our age model, the Hyperodapedon and Teyumbaita biozones in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas may respectively correlate (Fig. 12) to the lower and upper parts of the Scaphonyx-Exaeretodon-Herrerasaurus biozone at IPP 3 . Another interesting biostratigraphic pattern found in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas is the abundance of Teyumbaita around 260-300 mab. Although in much lower numbers because of a poorer sampling, this compares with the likely older Hyperodapedon proportional richness at the base of IPP sections. Preliminary reports mentioned the presence of Te. sulcognathus (= "Scaphonyx" sulcognathus) in the "upper" levels of the Ischigualasto Formation in the Hoyada de Ischigualasto 91,92 . Yet, these reports did not provide collection numbers for the putative Teyumbaita specimens, which could not be located in the collections or restudied here, neither there is precise information of how "upper" were these specimens collected in the section of IPP. In any case, these putative Teyumbaita records in IPP were reported as stratigraphically above those of "Scaphonyx" sanjuanensis, matching the biostratigraphic pattern described here for the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas. Only a broad alpha-taxonomy revision of the Hyperodapedon-clade 93 specimens of IPP would shed light on the biostratigraphic distribution of the rhynchosaurs in that area 38,40 . It would be important to see if Teyumbaita occurs in that area and, if present, whether or not it is stratigraphically separated from Hyperodapedon as in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas.

        <p>Previously, the rhynchosaur genus Teyumbaita was only conclusively recognised in the Late Triassic beds of the Santa Maria Supersequence 94 in southern Brazil (Fig. 12). Montefeltro et al. 41 revised the three betterknown records of the taxon, which was found above those of Hyperodapedon in all sites it occurs, matching the pattern seen in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas. All the records of Teyumbaita in Brazil are isolated, with no other associated index-fossils in beds of the same site. Accordingly, such Teyumbaita-bearing beds cannot be directly correlated with putatively coeval strata from other Triassic sites in southern Brazil, such as those where Exaeretodon abound in the absence of confirmed records of Hyperodapedon 95,96 . In fact, one previous record of Hyperodapedon (based on specimen MCN 3509PV), along with Exaeretodon in the Janner site [96][97][98] , is yet to be confirmed and, until further scrutiny, MCN 3509PV is safely assigned only to the Hyperodapedon-clade 34 . In any case, the Argentinean record of Teyumbaita supports the correlation of the strata where Exaeretodon is more abundant than Hyperodapedon in that country (i.e. upper Scaphonyx-Exaeretodon-Herrerasaurus and Exaeretodon biozones) 3 with the southern Brazilian beds where Teyumbaita and/or Exaeretodon occurs/abounds in the absence of Hyperodapedon 95 , i.e. Exaeretodon sub-assemblage zone 99 . The inferred ca. 228-227 Ma age for the Teyumbaita-rich beds in Argentina also matches the recently reported radioisotopic ages for the Hyperodapedon and Riograndia Assemblage Zones in Brazil 93 . These have been dated at ca. 233 and 226 Ma, respectively, and are consistently positioned below and above (Fig. 12) the Teyumbaita beds in the proposed stratigraphic schemes of the Santa Maria Supersequence 94 .Previously, the rhynchosaur genus Teyumbaita was only conclusively recognised in the Late Triassic beds of the Santa Maria Supersequence 94 in southern Brazil (Fig. 12).

        <p>The Late Triassic tetrapod faunal compilation of South America 93 revealed a gap in the tetrapod fossil record of western Pangaea near the Carnian-Norian boundary, bounded from below by the lower Ischigualasto Formation fauna, and from above by the faunas of the upper Ischigualasto Formation and Riograndia Assemblage Zone. The revised age model for the Ischigualasto Formation presented here essentially fills that purported gap, showing the continuity of a faunal structure recognized in strata such as those of the Hyperodapedon Assemblage-Zone in Brazil (dated at ca. 233 Ma) 93 across that stage boundary, at least in palaeolatitudes close to 40°-50° South. For example, rhynchosaurs still abound and proterochampsids still occur in such strata, differing from younger beds that lack such taxa 93 .The Late Triassic tetrapod faunal compilation of South America 93 revealed a gap in the tetrapod fossil record of western Pangaea near the Carnian-Norian boundary, bounded from below by the lower Ischigualasto Formation fauna, and from above by the faunas of the upper Ischigualasto Formation and Riograndia Assemblage Zone.

        <p>Therefore, it seems that the major Late Triassic turnover seen in the terrestrial tetrapod biotas of western Gondwana post-dates the assemblages currently known for the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas (and most probably the Carnian-Norian boundary), which is followed by Norian non-fossiliferous deposits that evidence an increase in humidity (see above). This has a significant impact on the first occurrence of tetrapod groups such as saurischian dinosaurs and crocodylomorphs in the fossil record.Therefore, it seems that the major Late Triassic turnover seen in the terrestrial tetrapod biotas of western Gondwana post-dates the assemblages currently known for the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas (and most probably the Carnian-Norian boundary), which is followed by Norian non-fossiliferous deposits that evidence an increase in humidity (see above).

        <p>In Brazil, the ca. 226 Ma (early Norian) dated beds in which the Riograndia Assemblage Zone was recorded preserve sedimentary environments that drastically depart from those yielding the Hyperodapedon Assemblage Zone (including the Teyumbaita-bearings beds), the lower part of which was dated as ca. 233 Ma. This transition represents the replacement of an ephemeral anastomosed fluvial-lacustrine system (Alemoa Member of the Santa Maria Formation) by a perennial braided fluvial system (Caturrita Formation) 100 , which indicates a pluviosity increase, as also suggested by Th/U geochemical data 101 . As such, it seems that the Norian onset in southwestern Pangaea was marked by a humidity increase, as seen in the Caturrita Formation in Brazil and the upper levels of the Ischigualasto Formation in Argentina, after a more arid period that itself post-dated the Carnian Pluvial Event 102,103 .

        <p>Pisanosaurus mertii and dinosaur origins. Pisanosaurus mertii Casamiquela 4 has been for a long time regarded as the oldest known ornithischian, but its dinosaur affinity was recently challenged by Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 , as well as in briefer accounts by Baron et al. 108 and Baron 109 . A comprehensive historical account of the taxon relationships has been provided 8 and there is no need to be duplicated here. Suffice to say, apart from broadly expressed scepticism [110][111][112][113][114] , the ornithischian affinity of Pi. mertii was only questioned on numerical phylogenetic grounds by the three papers mentioned above, and the matrices in Baron et al. 108 and Baron 109 are not independent from one another. In those hypotheses, the proposed alternative was to nest Pi. mertii among silesaurids, a dinosauromorph group usually positioned immediately outside the Dinosauria (but see Langer and Ferigolo 115 ). Given the potential evolutionary importance of this Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas taxon, here we review the anatomical evidence brought forward by Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 in support of the silesaurid affinity of Pi. mertii, as well as features that may instead suggest its ornithischian affinity.Pisanosaurus mertii and dinosaur origins.

        <p>Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 provided a compelling review of the anatomy of Pi. mertii and supported previous arguments claiming that the elements of its holotype belong to a single individual. Yet, a bone fragment that seems to represent a partial right femoral shaft was found among the Pi. mertii material 116 . It has an asymmetric fourth trochanter, as seen in non-neotheropod saurischian dinosaurs, in contrast to the pendant trochanter of ornithischians. This possible femur fragment has a preserved length of ca. 1.5 cm and a transverse width slightly below 1 cm, thus belonging to an individual considerably smaller than the holotype of Pi. mertii. As a result, we agree with Sereno 116 that bones of a smaller reptile-possibly an early saurischian dinosaur-may be stored together with and probably were associated to the holotype of Pi. mertii. Nevertheless, we still adhere to previous claims that the bones historically associated to Pi. mertii-which do not include this probable femur-belong to a single individual based on the matching size of the bones and field data describing the degree of articulation of the specimen when it was collected 107 . Here, we do not aim to review the anatomy of Pi. mertii, but regard this as a much-needed future enterprise, especially if assisted by non-destructive, tomographic techniques. Instead, we focus on revising anatomical traits that might help resolving the contentious placement of the taxon as either an ornithischian or a silesaurid.Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 provided a compelling review of the anatomy of Pi. mertii and supported previous arguments claiming that the elements of its holotype belong to a single individual.

        <p>We agree with Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 that the specimen preservation does not allow the positive identification of an external mandibular fenestra in Pi. mertii, but neither allows to confirm its absence. Yet, Pi. mertii has a depressed area on the lateral surface of the post-dentary portion of the hemimandible (Fig. 13a) that is recognized only in heterodontosaurids, i.e. "external mandibular fossa" of Sereno 116 , among early dinosauromorphs [117][118][119] . Its more deeply excavated anteroventral corner is in a position similar to that occupied by the external mandibular fenestra of ornithischians 116 . Indeed, a reduced fenestra could be an evidence of the ornithischian affinity of Pi. mertii, whereas its putative absence would be autapomorphic for Pi. mertii.We agree with Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 that the specimen preservation does not allow the positive identification of an external mandibular fenestra in Pi. mertii, but neither allows to confirm its absence.

        <p>For about two centimetres posterior to the broken tip of the bone, the medial surface of the dentary of Pi. mertii is medially expanded at its ventral margin (Fig. 13b,c). A similar condition is seen in some ornithischians 116,119 , but not in silesaurids 115,120 . Also, the dentary of Pi. mertii possesses a gradual torsion towards its anterior end, where the cross-section of the bone gets dorsolateral to ventromedially oriented (Fig. 13c). This condition is present in at least some ornithischians (e.g. Eocursor parvus, SAM-PK-K8025), but absent in silesaurids and other early dinosauromorphs. The presence of a tall coronoid process on a relatively short dentary, producing a strongly concave dorsal margin of the bone in lateral-medial views, also resembles more the condition in heterodontosaurids 17 than in silesaurids 121 , saurischians 93,117,122 , and even other ornithischians 119,123 ; but a better quantification of these differences must be provided before they can be used to infer the affinities of Pi. mertii. Also, the apparent lack of replacement foramina in the Pi. mertii lower jaw may support its heterodontosaurid affinities within ornithischians 116 , as those are present in other early members of that group 123,124 , as well as in silesaurids 115,125 .For about two centimetres posterior to the broken tip of the bone, the medial surface of the dentary of Pi. mertii is medially expanded at its ventral margin (Fig. 13b,c).

        <p>The dentary of Pi. mertii has a strong, bulbous ridge extending below the tooth row, especially at its posterior half, forming a "buccal emargination" 116 , between the ridge and the teeth (Fig. 13a,b). A similar structure also appears to extend above the maxillary tooth row, but this is harder to confirm given the incomplete preservation of that bone. Such a strong ridge and emargination is absent in silesaurids 115 and dinosaurs in general, including early sauropodomorphs 93,122 . On the contrary, this is seen in several 116,119,[126][127][128] , although not all, early ornithischians 123,124,129 .

        <p>Inferring the mode of tooth attachment in Pi. mertii is exceedingly hard because of poor preservation (and conjectural) without the support of CT-Scan or histology techniques. Thus (contra Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ), until more detailed data is available, we consider that tooth attachment cannot be used to infer either affinity (i.e. silesaurid or ornithischian) for Pi. mertii. Nevertheless, repreparation of the base of one of the maxillary teeth revealed the absence of fusion to the surrounding bone. Most preserved tooth crowns of Pi. mertii are broader labiolingually than mesiodistally (Fig. 13b), or at least equally broad in those two axes 107 . This is a very unusual condition among early dinosauromorphs and is approached only by the highly modified molariform teeth of some heterodontosaurids 116 . We agree with Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 that tooth crowns of Pi. mertii lack signs of carinae or denticles, but we disagree with those authors (p. 22) 107 in that the lack of denticles support a silesaurid affinity for Pi. mertii, as these elements are clearly seen in most representatives of the group 115,120,130 . Unlike Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 , we found it difficult to define enamel thickness or the presence of longitudinal ridges in the Pi. mertii teeth. Yet, we concur with those authors that a blunt primary ridge, like that of ornithischians 116,123,124,127 is seen in some teeth. This produces a morphology that most closely resembles that of the constricted, cup-shaped bases of Heterodontosaurus tucki and Lycorhinus angustidens molariform crowns 116,131 . Similarly, the maxillary tooth crowns of Pi. mertii are medially inclined (Fig. 13d), resembling the condition in He. tucki (SAM-PK-K1332), but contrasting with the vertical teeth of silesaurids. Finally, tooth crowns of Pi. mertii are only similarly short as those of some silesaurids if these are compared to the "blade-like" crowns of plesiomorphic putative members of the group such as Lewisuchus admixtus 132,133 . Accordingly, contra Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 , short tooth crowns cannot be used prima facie (i.e. in the absence of a phylogenetic framework) to infer a silesaurid affinity for P. mertii. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We agree with Bonaparte 134 (contra Casamiquela 4 ) that a pair of isolated vertebrae of Pi. mertii represent cervical elements. The centra are parallelogram-shaped in lateral view, a condition unrecognized in early dinosauromorph tail vertebrae. As such, they more closely resemble the short cervical elements of early ornithischians 116,135 than the more elongated vertebrae of silesaurids 136 . The trunk vertebrae of Pi. mertii are generally compressed lateromedially, with tall neural arches (about as deep as the centra) and well-developed prezygadiapophyseal, postzygadiapophyseal, prezygaparapophyseal, and anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae (see fig. 6 in Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ). This condition is very similar to that of Silesaurus opolensis 136 , markedly departing from the morphology of early ornithischian trunk vertebrae, which are not as lateromedially compressed and have dorsoventrally short neural arches with poorly defined or no lamination 116,123,135,137 . As for the impressions of the sacral vertebrae, we agree with most authors that there is evidence of at least four elements and that the sacral ribs are shared between two vertebrae. Silesaurids have either two or three sacral vertebrae 120,121 and sacral ribs shared between two vertebrae are seen in both silesaurids 120,130 and early ornithischians 132,138 (Scelidosaurus harrisonii, NHMUK PV R1111).

        <p>Pelvic features are very hard to identify, including if the acetabulum was open or closed, even if partially. Yet, we concur with Sereno 124 that none of the modifications seen in the opisthopubic pelvis of ornithischians can be recognized in Pi. mertii. On the contrary, the puboischial articulation is dorsoventrally extended and the ischial symphysis is not restricted to the distal end of the bone, suggesting a plesiomorphic propubic pattern. The popliteal fossa of the femur of Pi. mertii seems to be overprepared along its distal two centimeters, but we agree with Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 that ridges surrounding the fossa can be traced along the five distal centimeters of the bone (see fig. 11 in Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ). The associated tibia is about 16 cm long, so we could infer a minimal femoral length of 15 cm, suggesting that such ridges extended over the distal third of the bone. This condition matches that of silesaurids, in which the popliteal fossa extends for more than one fourth of the femoral length 132 , but conditions similar to that of Pi. mertii, with rather subtle proximally extending ridges, are seen in various early dinosauromorphs, including ornithischians 127 (Scutelosaurus lawleri, MNA V175; Laquintasaura venezuelae). Also (contra Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ), the cranial intermuscular line of early dinosaurs does not usually reach the distal third of the bone 139,140 , so that its absence in the preserved portion of femur of Pi. mertii is not evidence for its non-dinosaurian affinity.Pelvic features are very hard to identify, including if the acetabulum was open or closed, even if partially.

        <p>As stated by Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 , the tibia of Pi. mertii is indeed devoid of a cnemial crest that expands proximally relative to the femoral facet. This configuration is very similar to that of Sacisaurus agudoensis 115 , departing from the typical dinosaur condition, including that of most ornithischians 116,127,138 (Sc. lawleri, MNA V175). Therefore, the reduced cnemial crest of Pi. mertii seems to better fit a silesaurid affinity. Yet, this character has a more complex distribution, with proximally unexpanded crests seen in undescribed specimens of La. venezuelae and the holotype of Lesothosaurus diagnosticus (NHMUK PV RU B17), and a more projected crest is seen in Asilisaurus kongwe 120 . A fibular crest as that of most theropods and silesaurids is indeed seen in the tibia of Pi. mertii and lacking in most early ornithischians 127,135,138 (Sc. lawleri, MNA V175), but we see no reason (contra Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ) to disregard its homology to the crest present in heterodontosaurids 141 . In addition, the posterior hemicondyles of the proximal end of the tibia are separated from one another by a deep and very transversely broad notch (see Fig. 6l in Irmis et al. 111 ) that closely resembles the condition in several early ornithischians (e.g. He. tucki, SAM-PK-K1332; Eo. parvus, SAM-PK-K8025; Sc. lawleri, UCMP 130580). By contrast, the posterior hemicondyles of the tibia are separated by a distinct change in slope or a narrow groove in other early dinosauromorphs.As stated by Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 , the tibia of Pi. mertii is indeed devoid of a cnemial crest that expands proximally relative to the femoral facet. This configuration is very similar to that of Sacisaurus agudoensis 115 , departing from the typical dinosaur condition, including that of most ornithischians 116,127,138 (Sc. lawleri, MNA V175).

        <p>The articulation with the astragalus hampers a proper assessment of the distal outline of the tibia, but it is possible to infer that it is at least as broad anteroposteriorly as lateromedially, as occurs in most silesaurids 120,130 and early dinosaurs, such as herrerasaurids and early sauropodomorphs 122,142 . Instead, neotheropods, ornithischians 142 , and Sa. agudoensis 115 , have a much more lateromedially expanded distal end of the bone. We agree with Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 that the posterolateral margin of the tibia of Pi. mertii is not concave as in early ornithischians (L. diagnosticus, NHMUK PV RU B17; Sc. lawleri, MNA V1752), but we disagree that this feature supports its silesaurid affinity, as a similar plesiomorphic condition is also seen in most early dinosauromorphs, including dinosaurs 142 . As for the descending process of the tibia (= outer malleolus or posterolateral process) of Pi. mertii, it expands only slightly lateral to the anterolateral corner of the distal end of the bone (see fig. 12c in Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ), resembling the condition of Asili. kongwe 120 , early sauropodomorphs, and herrerasaurids 122,142 , but markedly differing from neotheropods, ornithischians 142 , and Sa. agudoensis 115 , which bear an extensive descending process. Also, the descending process is well developed in some specimens of Si. opolensis (ZPAL Ab III 413, 415), although not as much as in ornithischians, whereas other specimens of that silesaurid (ZPAL Ab III 403/1, 460/3) bear a short process as in Pi. mertii. Finally, as mentioned by Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 the distal part of the fibula in Pi. mertii is not as slender as that of ornithischians 116,123,135 , retaining instead the transversely broader condition that is plesiomorphic among dinosauromorphs.The articulation with the astragalus hampers a proper assessment of the distal outline of the tibia, but it is possible to infer that it is at least as broad anteroposteriorly as lateromedially, as occurs in most silesaurids 120,130 and early dinosaurs, such as herrerasaurids and early sauropodomorphs 122,142 .

        <p>The anteroposterior breadth of the lateral margin of the astragalus of Pi. mertii is about three-fourths of its lateromedial width (Fig. 13e). Thus, that bone is proportionally less lateromedially expanded than in silesaurids 120,130 and early saurischians 122,139,143,144 , but has similar proportions to that of ornithischians (Sc. lawleri, MNA V175) 141 . Similarly, the proximodistal height of the astragalar ascending process with respect to the height of the astragalar body (see fig. 12d,e in Agnolín and Rozadilla 8 ) resembles more the condition in ornithischians (Sc. lawleri, MNA V175) than the shallower process of silesaurids 120,130 . However, the lateromedially narrow and medially sloping astragalar ascending process of Pi. mertii, as seen in anterior view (see fig. 12c in Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ), resembles the condition in silesaurids more than that of early ornithischians.The anteroposterior breadth of the lateral margin of the astragalus of Pi. mertii is about three-fourths of its lateromedial width (Fig. 13e).

        <p>The calcaneum of Pi. mertii (Fig. 13e) retains a well recognizable calcaneal tuber and an expanded posteromedial corner of the bone, forming the "ventromedial projection" 143 .

        <p>www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Accordingly, contra Agnolín and Rozadilla (p. 22) 107 , the calcaneal tuber does not support the non-dinosaurian affinity of Pi. mertii. Also, the calcaneum of Pi. mertii is lateromedially compressed, resembling the condition in the paratype of Sc. lawleri (MNA V1752) and heterodontosaurids 116,129,141 . The anterior and lateral margins of the calcaneum-fibula articulation reveal a convex calcaneal facet, with a slightly straighter posterior part, whereas the medial view reveals a concave calcaneum margin (see fig. 13a,b in Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ). As discussed by Agnolín and Rozadilla (p. 11, 19) 107 , but with the sides reversed, such a complex articulation is more typical of non-dinosaurian archosaurs, although lacking in lagerpetids and Si. opolensis 143,145 . On the other hand, the fibula-calcaneum articulation of Pi. mertii clearly differs from that of ornithischians, in which the main basin that occupies the posterior two-thirds of the proximal articulation of the calcaneum receives the outer malleolus of the tibia, whereas the fibula articulated only to the top of the raised anterior third of the bone 129,141 (Sc. lawleri, MNA V1752).www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Accordingly, contra Agnolín and Rozadilla (p. 22) 107 , the calcaneal tuber does not support the non-dinosaurian affinity of Pi. mertii.

        <p>Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 mentioned that metatarsal IV of Pi. mertii resembles those of silesaurids and saurischians because it is compressed at the proximal end. Indeed, the available data for early ornithischians (Le. diagnosticus, NHMUK PV RU B17; He. tucki, SAM-PK-K1332) reveal a more robust proximal articulation of metatarsal IV. On the contrary, contra Agnolín and Rozadilla (p. 22) 107 , the ungual phalanx of the fourth pedal digit of Pi. mertii, and the only available for the taxon (see Fig. 15 in Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 ), lacks the marked dorsoventral flattening present in silesaurids, contradicting a possible silesaurid affinity.Agnolín and Rozadilla 107 mentioned that metatarsal IV of Pi. mertii resembles those of silesaurids and saurischians because it is compressed at the proximal end.

        <p>The features discussed above (Table 2) show that most character-states previously used to support a silesaurid affinity for Pi. mertii are likely plesiomorphic for Dinosauriformes, being also present in other dinosauromorphs and early dinosaurs. Some other characters are variable among silesaurids and ornithischians. Conversely, we found over ten character-states that are shared only by Pi. mertii and heterodontosaurids and/or other early ornithischians among early dinosauriforms. As a result, we consider that the ornithischian affinity of Pi. mertii rests on much stronger grounds than the silesaurid hypothesis. A quantitative analysis of the phylogenetic relationships of Pi. mertii goes beyond the scope of this paper and it will be conducted in the near future, integrating the new information provided here.The features discussed above (Table 2) show that most character-states previously used to support a silesaurid affinity for Pi. mertii are likely plesiomorphic for Dinosauriformes, being also present in other dinosauromorphs and early dinosaurs.

        <p>As discussed by previous authors 107,109,111,116,124 , considered as an ornithischian, Pi. mertii fills the long ghost lineage between other members of the group (Early Jurassic) 109 and the oldest known saurischians (ca. 233 Ma) 93 . Here, we constrain the age of Pi. mertii as ca. 229 Ma, showing that this species is latest Carnian. As a result, the long ghost lineage is transferred into the ornithischian clade, with the group absent in the fossil record for more than 30 My. Pisanosaurus mertii provides key clues about the early evolutionary history of Ornithischia and it is thus one of the most important components of the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas fauna.

        <p>The comparison of Bonaparte's field notes with published accounts by Reig 7 and Bonaparte 3,4,6,[11][12][13] raises some critical issues. The two fossils mentioned in the note from May 24th correspond to the holotypes of Pi. mertii and V. rusconii, respectively. The published sources state that they were collected in the middle section of the Ischigualasto Formation, but the field notes indicate the lower third of the unit as their provenances, and this is corroborated by the 1962 field work picture (Fig. S2). Bonaparte's sketch map of the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas (Fig. S1a) indicates the fossiliferous levels, but it is not detailed enough to further help in the discussion. In addition, Bonaparte's field notes (see also Reig 7 ) indicate that they collected rhynchosaur and cynodont material in the Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas, but these were never described. In the collections of Instituto Miguel Lillo (San Miguel de Tucumán, Argentina), where the fossil collected by Bonaparte at the time were deposited, rhynchosaurs and cynodonts from the Ischigualasto Formation are either mentioned as coming from the San Juan Province or no geographic provenance is provided. It is possible, therefore, that some of the material actually came from the La Rioja province, but this information was omitted from the collection records, which at that time focussed on their stratigraphic rather than geographical origins.The comparison of Bonaparte's field notes with published accounts by Reig 7 and Bonaparte 3,4,6,[11][12][13] raises some critical issues.

        <p>At the end of May 2013, our five-member team conducted a five-day exploratory field trip to the area, where the fossiliferous beds in question were identified, yielding fossils such as rhynchosaurs and the cynodont genus Exaeretodon. The promising results provided impetus for more comprehensive research projects, funded by the South American agencies ANPCyT (Argentina) and FAPESP (Brazil), to fully explore the Cerro Las Lajas area. Three extended field excursions were conducted during April-May of 2016, 2017, and 2019, each with over ten participants, including palaeontologists and geologists of diverse expertise. These resulted in the collection of over 100 new fossil specimens within a highresolution framework of measured stratigraphic sections, as well as in identification and sampling of volcanic beds for radioisotopic age determination. The results provided a more accurate chronostratigraphic context for the invaluable fossils collected in the sixties, as well as for the entire Ischigualasto Formation fauna, allowing for their more precise correlation to coeval assemblages.At the end of May 2013, our five-member team conducted a five-day exploratory field trip to the area, where the fossiliferous beds in question were identified, yielding fossils such as rhynchosaurs and the cynodont genus Exaeretodon.

The basal Ischigualasto strata also contain intraclasts of the underlying Los Rastros Formation. Fine-grained lithologies are often massive, with salt crystals and/or gypsum layers as fracture infilling. Other post-depositional modifications include pedogenetic root traces and phreatic hydromorphism, marked by discoloration (mottling) with lateral persistence. This facies association is interpreted as a meandering fluvial depositional setting where the proportion of channels to floodplains is in the range of 1:2 to 1:5. The shallowing-upward, basal succession of the Ischigualasto Formation suggest a relative decrease in accommodation space, resulting from a prograding normal regression 15 .Extraformational clasts smaller than 8 cm are found exclusively at the base of the channels (lag).

        <p>Colombi et al. 16 interpreted such amalgamated channel belts as a temporal adjustment of the fluvial system to the equilibrium profile (aggradation under low accommodation) after an incision surface in the centre of the basin, which suggests a fall in the lacustrine level.Colombi et al. 16 interpreted such amalgamated channel belts as a temporal adjustment of the fluvial system to the equilibrium profile (aggradation under low accommodation) after an incision surface in the centre of the basin, which suggests a fall in the lacustrine level.</p>
        <p>This interval can be interpreted as a delayed outcome of the preceding Carnian Pluvial At 107 m above base, a prominent tuff bed up to 2 m in thickness occurs at the base of a ca. 1.5 m-thick sandstone ledge (Fig. S3b). This bed is a white, matrix-supported, crystal-rich tuff, which is distinct from all other tuffaceous (bentonitic) interbeds of the lower Ischigualasto Formation and is herein labelled "Toba-2" (Fig. S3a-b). The documented fossil record of the Ischigualasto Formation at Las Lajas begins immediately above the "Toba-2" level (Fig. S3c). Based on its distinct lithology and stratigraphic position, we consider Toba-2 as a direct correlative of the Herr Toba tuff 9,22 exposed in the lower Ischigualasto Formation at IPP.This interval can be interpreted as a delayed outcome of the preceding Carnian Pluvial At 107 m above base, a prominent tuff bed up to 2 m in thickness occurs at the base of a ca. 1.5 m-thick sandstone ledge (Fig. S3b).

        <p>ii.ii) Middle section. The middle Ischigualasto Formation at Las Lajas (310-740 m above base) marks a transition from amalgamated to isolated/sinuous channels, along with preservation of thick floodplain deposits (Fig. S3c). Channel bodies are less than 1m in thickness and have more than 100 m of lateral extension. These meandering fluvial deposits shows a channel to floodplain proportion of &lt;1:10, suggesting higher accommodation and a regional rise in the base level. The middle section also marks the first occurrence of pinkish-white, welded tuff (ignimbrite) beds, with thicknesses of less than 1m in this part of the succession. Increased volcanic activity would produce episodic increases in aggradation with the vertical growth of the alluvial plains 16 , resulting in fine-grained floodplain deposits, paleosols and hydromorphic discoloration. The change from calcic to argillic paleosols suggests elevated humidity during this interval, similar to that recognized in the area of the IPP 23,24 .ii.ii) Middle section.

        <p>ii.iii) Upper section. The upper interval of the Ischigualasto Formation (740-1070 m above base) is dominated by successive amalgamated channels, similar to those described in the lower section, which are interbedded with fine-grained floodplain deposits. The individual channels are typically less than 1m-thick, while the amalgamated channels bodies exceed more than 5 m in thickness. The proportion of channels to floodplains gradually increases from 1:5 to 10:1, along with an upward decrease in channel incision. This upwardthickening trend of channels is accompanied by an increase in average clast size (15 cm maximum) that represents a rise in the flow energy of the fluvial system. The changes in grain-size, thickness, shape and frequency of channels suggest transition from a meandering to a braided fluvial system, which is the likely result of decrease in accommodation space.ii.iii) Upper section.

        <p>In comparison, the petrographic characteristics of the bone bed of an indeterminate tetrapod fossil fragment (field number JT 02-2016) from about 120 m above base (a short distance above the "Toba 2" tuff) reveals a quartz-arenite with dark iron oxide matrix (Fig. S4b), very similar to the matrix of Pi. mertii. Similarly, the bone bed of the rhynchosaur fossil (CRILAR-Pv 658) from 270 m above base (main fossil zone; Fig. S4e) has the characteristics of a greywacke with a very opaque matrix and "pseudoclasts" composed of bone fragments, which is lithologically very similar to the matrix of V. rusconii. A third sample taken from a rhynchosaur bone bed (CRILAR-Pv 654) and from the same level as JT 02-2016 is a fine greywacke (~50% clasts, 0.1 to 0.5 mm in size) composed of a variety of clast sizes and shapes (subangular, poorly sorted) and abundant volcanic glass. The opaque matrix is a mixture of iron oxide, siliceous and carbonate cement. The comparison of samples collected in this study to the matrix rocks from the historical findings suggests that Pi. mertii was collected from brownish mudstones that occur throughout the section, but are most common near its base. Because Pi. mertii was preserved within a concretion with iron oxide matrix, we speculate that it came from a level between 110 and 180 m above base, characterized by "dark-reddish" concretions and high concentration of iron oxides. This level is below the main fossil zone at 240-300 m above base, but generally matches records of Hyperodapedon, Aetosauroides, and Exaeretodon.In comparison, the petrographic characteristics of the bone bed of an indeterminate tetrapod fossil fragment (field number JT 02-2016) from about 120 m above base (a short distance above the "Toba 2" tuff) reveals a quartz-arenite with dark iron oxide matrix (Fig. S4b), very similar to the matrix of Pi. mertii.

        <p>In contrast, the matrix of V. rusconii matches thin-bedded siltstones typical of upper levels of the main fossil zone, hence occurring conceivably together with Teyumbaita, Proterochampsa, and Exaeretodon.

        <p>Samples of tuff collected from the Ischigualasto Formation at Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas range from ledge-forming welded tuffs (ignimbrites) to geomorphologically recessed bentonites. Twenty one single zircons from 3 tuff samples were analyzed by the U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS method at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Isotope Laboratory, following the general procedures described in Ramezani et al. 25 . The welded tuffs were processed by standard crushing and pulverizing techniques, whereas the bentonites were liquefied in water for 48 hours and disaggregated in a blender, followed by removal of clay components using an ultrasonic dismembrator device 26 . Heavy mineral concentrations were obtained using a Frantz® magnetic separator and high-density liquids. Zircons were hand selected under a binocular microscope and pretreated by a chemical abrasion technique modified after Mattinson 27 , which involved thermal annealing in a furnace at 900°C for 60 hours, followed by partial dissolution in 29M HF at 210°C in high-pressure vessels for 12 hours. The chemically abraded grains were fluxed in several hundred microliters of dilute HNO3 and 6M HCl, successively on a hot plate and in an ultrasonic bath (1 hour each), and rinsed with several volumes of Millipore water in between to remove the leachates.Samples of tuff collected from the Ischigualasto Formation at Hoyada del Cerro Las Lajas range from ledge-forming welded tuffs (ignimbrites) to geomorphologically recessed bentonites. Twenty one single zircons from 3 tuff samples were analyzed by the U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS method at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Isotope Laboratory, following the general procedures described in Ramezani et al. 25 . The welded tuffs were processed by standard crushing and pulverizing techniques, whereas the bentonites were liquefied in water for 48 hours and disaggregated in a blender, followed by removal of clay components using an ultrasonic dismembrator device 26 .

        <p>All zircon grains were spiked with the EARTHTIME ET535 mixed 205 Pb-233 U-235 U isotopic tracer 28,29 prior to complete dissolution in 29M HF at 210°C for 48 hours and subsequent Pb and U purification via an HCl-based anion-exchange column chemistry 30 . Pb and U were loaded together onto single outgassed Re filaments along with a silica-gel emitter solution and their isotopic ratios were measured on an Isotopx X62 multi-collector thermal ionization mass spectrometer equipped with a Daly photomultiplier ion-counting system at MIT. Pb isotopes were measured as mono-atomic ions in a peak-hopping mode on the ion-counter and were corrected for a mass-dependent isotope fractionation of 0.18% ± 0.05% per atomic mass unit (2σ). U isotopes were measured as dioxide ions in a static mode using three Faraday collectors, while subjected to a within-run mass fractionation correction using the 233 U/ 235 U ratio of the tracer and a predicted sample 238 U/ 235 U ratio of 137.818 ± 0.045 31 , as well as an oxide correction based on an independently determined 18 O/ 16 O ratio of 0.00205 ± 0.00005.All zircon grains were spiked with the EARTHTIME ET535 mixed 205 Pb-233 U-235 U isotopic tracer 28,29 prior to complete dissolution in 29M HF at 210°C for 48 hours and subsequent Pb and U purification via an HCl-based anion-exchange column chemistry 30 .

        <p>Complete Pb and U isotopic data are given in Supplementary Materials Table S1 and the age results are illustrated on the age plots of Figure 4. Data reduction, calculation of dates and propagation of uncertainties used the Tripoli and ET_Redux applications and algorithms 32,33 . The individual 206 Pb/ 238 U dates were corrected for initial 230 Th disequilibrium based on a magma Th/U ratio of 2.8 ± 1.0 (2σ). The sample age is calculated based on the weighted mean 206 Pb/ 238 U date of the youngest statistically coherent population of analyses from each sample that overlap within 2σ analytical uncertainty, after excluding older analyses interpreted as detrital or xenocrystic. A set of high-precision tuff dates that are mutually resolvable outside internal uncertainties and obey superposition serve as reliable approximations for the respective sediment deposition ages. Calculated sample dates along with their 95% confidence level uncertainties are reported in Table S1 and follow the notation ±X/Y/Z Ma, where X is the internal (analytical) uncertainty in the absence of all external errors, Y incorporates the U-Pb tracer calibration error, and Z includes the latter as well as the U decay constant errors of Jaffey et al. 34 . Z must be taken into account when dates from different chronometers (e.g., U-Pb of this study versus 40 Ar/ 39 Ar of Rogers et al. 22 ) are compared.Complete Pb and U isotopic data are given in Supplementary Materials Table S1 and the age results are illustrated on the age plots of Figure 4.
