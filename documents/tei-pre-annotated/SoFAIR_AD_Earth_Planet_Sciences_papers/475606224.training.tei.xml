        <p>• Pollutants in flue gases mean fly ash and similar residues need controlled disposal Abstract: Use of biomass for energy production is increasing, so management of the resultant ash is important. This review compares current and future production, chemical composition, and reuse options for ash from common feedstocks (agricultural residues, energy crops, woody biomass, forest residues, recovered wood, paper sludge, sewage sludge and municipal solid waste). Global production is ~170 Mt/yr, but could increase to ~1000 Mt/yr if all available biomass were exploited. Current production is dominated wood and waste derived ashes, but there is capacity to greatly increase use of agricultural residues. Combustion of virgin biomass in modern furnaces can produce ash with negligible persistent organic pollutants and low contaminant metals concentrations, so application to land is possible. Agricultural residue ashes contain abundant potassium and useful phosphate, so could potentially be used as fertiliser.• Pollutants in flue gases mean fly ash and similar residues need controlled disposal Abstract: Use of biomass for energy production is increasing, so management of the resultant ash is important.

        <p>Forestry ashes are rich in CaO, but slightly higher contaminant metals levels may restrict their use to forestry soils. Recovery of potassium from these ashes, and their use in cementitious materials have also been demonstrated. Biomass containing waste ashes potentially contain more persistent organic pollutants and contaminant metals. However, municipal solid waste bottom ash is routinely used as a construction aggregate for prescribed applications. Paper sludge ash is suitable for restricted use as a soil conditioner and possibly as a secondary pozzolan.

        <p>it is therefore imperative that energy production transitions to more sustainable fuels in the coming decades. The proportion of global energy consumption supplied from fossil fuels has dropped from ~95% in 1970 to ~80% of the worldwide energy consumption in 2016 because of advances in other energy technologies and increasing public awareness of the need for change [1,2]. The balance in global energy consumption has been supplied by nuclear energy (~2%) and renewable energy sources (~18%) [3]. Renewable energy sources in current global energy supply include bioenergy, hydro, solar, wind, geothermal and tidal. Bioenergy derived from sustainable biomass is the largest and most important category contributing ~70% of the total renewable supply [3]. Combustion of solid biomass accounted for 91% of biomass energy supply in 2017, with liquid biofuel and biogas contributing 7% and 2% to biomass supply, respectively [3].it is therefore imperative that energy production transitions to more sustainable fuels in the coming decades.

        <p>There are different definitions of biomass [3][4][5][6][7]. The word is widely used to describe "all organic material that stems from plants (including algae, trees and crops)" [4]. Thus, biomass includes all plant-derived wastes, and is divided into four main types: woody plants, herbaceous plants/grasses, aquatic plants and manure. Subsequently, the definition has been refined to "contemporaneous (non-fossil) and complex biogenic organic-inorganic solid products generated by natural and anthropogenic (technogenic) processes" [5], and the list of categories has been extended to wood and woody biomass, herbaceous and agricultural biomass, aquatic biomass, animal and human biomass wastes (including bones, meat-bone meal, chicken litter, various manures, etc.), contaminated and industrial biomass wastes (including municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, demolition wood, paper sludge, etc.), and biomass mixtures.There are different definitions of biomass [3][4][5][6][7].

        <p>Electricity generation, accounts for about 15% of biomass consumption [3]. Commonly, the biomass is burned in a fixed, fluidised or pulverised bed boiler to produce high-pressure steam, which then drives a turbine to generate electricity [8]. Generation is undertaken in both electricity only and combined heat and power plants (the former is ~30% energy efficient, whereas the latter can have an overall efficiency of ~80% [9]). At present, the types of biomass used for heat/electricity generation are commonly from agriculture/forestry residues, dedicated energy crops, wood fuel/charcoal/chips/pellets, municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, and paper sludge [3,5,10].

        <p>Currently bioenergy from forestry sources is the largest contributor to global bioenergy supply, but it is estimated that the agriculture residues and dedicated energy crops will play a critical role in future bioenergy supply [3,15]. Also, with the increasing population growth and urbanization, more energy extraction by combustion of MSW and sewage sludge can be expected in coming decades [16,17]. Therefore, it is anticipated that bioenergy from a variety of different alternative fuels will make an important contribution to meeting future energy demands.Currently bioenergy from forestry sources is the largest contributor to global bioenergy supply, but it is estimated that the agriculture residues and dedicated energy crops will play a critical role in future bioenergy supply [3,15].

        <p>When fuels derived from these renewable resources or waste materials are burnt to produce electricity/heat, ash will inevitably be produced, and that ash will differ in its physical and chemical properties from ash produced by more traditional fuels such as coal [18][19][20]. Thus, alternative reuse or, if necessary, disposal strategies are required [21]. Also, while the ash's weight/volume will be a fraction of that of the feedstock (for example, ash content for woody biomass is typically 1.5 -2% [5,22], and incineration reduces MSW by ~90% in volume and ~70%-80% in mass [23,24]), the total amount of ash produced globally is still considerable, and is likely to increase as bioenergy utilization increases. Better understanding of the ash produced from above-mentioned alternative fuels is needed if that ash is to be put to productive use (to deliver a circular energy economy or promote a circular materials economy), or disposed of safely with the minimum investment of further energy in that disposal [25,26].When fuels derived from these renewable resources or waste materials are burnt to produce electricity/heat, ash will inevitably be produced, and that ash will differ in its physical and chemical properties from ash produced by more traditional fuels such as coal [18][19][20].

        <p>When a renewable fuel feedstock is burnt to generate electricity/heat, there are many factors that can determine the resultant ash properties, and thus dictate the appropriate measures for subsequent ash management. The primary factor that determines the chemical composition of the ash is the feedstock composition [25,[27][28][29], but factors such as the physical nature of the feedstock, and the type, size and operating status of the incinerator can determine the efficiency of combustion and the partitioning of volatile elements [6,[30][31][32][33]. Biomass ashes are usually rich in elements such as Si, K, Ca, P, Mg, etc. [34][35][36][37], so it may be possible to recover essential plant nutrients like potassium and phosphorus or apply the ash directly to agricultural or forestry soils (many biomass ashes are relatively benign [38][39][40]). Management of ash from the combustion of waste biomass (such as MSW and sewage sludge) may be more challenging as it can contain elevated concentrations of contaminant trace metals [41][42][43]. However, even these ashes may contain values that can be extracted to off-set management costs (sewage sludge incineration ash, SSIA, typically contains ~15% P2O5 which is comparable to natural phosphate rock [44][45][46][47]), and MSW incineration ashes contain a variety of ferrous and non-ferrous metals that can be recovered [48][49][50].When a renewable fuel feedstock is burnt to generate electricity/heat, there are many factors that can determine the resultant ash properties, and thus dictate the appropriate measures for subsequent ash management.

        <p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current production of biomass ash derived from common feedstocks used for energy generation. It estimates potential future ash arisings based on authoritative data on the production of the feedstocks and their different ash contents and predicts likely changes in biomass ash production rates. Finally, it reviews the reuse options for the major biomass ash types being produced now and in the future. Ash from combustion of agricultural residues, energy crops, woody biomass, forest residues, recovered wood, paper sludge, sewage sludge, and municipal solid waste are considered. Increased future use of biomass to provide energy is seen by many as essential in the transition to a low carbon future, particularly if it can be combined with carbon capture and storage [51,52], and can help nations achieve emissions targets as established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview that supports their sustainable management, and thus informs rational decision-making about energy generation from biomass feedstocks. Specifically: (1) the amount of biomass from different sources that is burnt globally as bioenergy and resulting ash production are quantified, and the potential for future changes in these quantities are estimated, (2) the typical major element compositions, and the potential trace metal and toxin contents of ash from different feedstocks are reported, (3) biomass ash classification systems that inform ash management are discussed, and (4) options from beneficial reuse, value recovery from, or sustainable management of ash from different feedstocks are reviewed.This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current production of biomass ash derived from common feedstocks used for energy generation.

        <p>Currently, national biomass ash production figures are not routinely published, and annual production is changing rapidly as many nations are attempting to transition to a low-carbon economy [53][54][55]. Therefore, it is difficult to directly estimate the worldwide production of ash from sustainable fuels. This is further complicated by national differences in how data is reported (e.g. biomass ash figures from some countries include partial coal co-combustion with biomass) [56]. However, ash production can be estimated from biomass production data, which is better recorded in most regions.Currently, national biomass ash production figures are not routinely published, and annual production is changing rapidly as many nations are attempting to transition to a low-carbon economy [53][54][55].

        <p>Estimates of the sustainable amount of biomass that is available for energy production can be compared to the amount of carbon that is captured annually by terrestrial photosynthesis.

        <p>Similarly, a best-estimate of 147 Pg C y -1 (range 131-163 Pg C y -1 ) has been obtained from remote sensing of the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation [58].

        <p>It was estimated in 2013 that approximately 7 billion tonnes (Gt) of biomass were burned annually for energy production [25]. This widely cited figure represents about 2% of the organic matter created annually by photosynthesis. However, it appears to be based on an optimistic interpretation of data published between 2001 and 2010 (possibly to allow for growth in the biomass fuel usage in the intervening period). For example, it includes 3 Gt for forest residues, whereas the cited paper reports just under 2 Gt of forestry-based biofuels were produced worldwide in 2006 [60]. Three separate sources were used to estimate the range for agricultural residues (between 1.1 and 3.1 Gt/yr [60][61][62]) however a high-end figure is incorporated into the total. Typical ash production rates [5] were used to estimate that this biomass would have produced about 480 million tonnes of ash. Separately, it has been estimated that, globally, 43.5 -56.5 EJ of energy was produced from biomass fuels in 2016 [3,63]. If the energy content of fuel was similar to wood (the principal biomass fuel in use), then the total global usage of biomass is about 3 Gt/yr. This more modest figure represents about 1% of the organic matter created annually by photosynthesis.It was estimated in 2013 that approximately 7 billion tonnes (Gt) of biomass were burned annually for energy production [25].

        <p>As the estimates of biomass burned for energy production reported in the literature are based on data &gt;10 yrs old, a new estimate of biomass fuel usage has been made (Table 1). The quantities of the principal agricultural residues suitable for biomass combustion (e.g. cereals crops and sugarcane) have been estimated by using United Nations (UN) agricultural production figures for 2018 [3] and average crop to residue ratios [64]. Worldwide, agricultural residues contribute less than 3% to the total bioenergy production of 55.6 EJ in 2017 [3], which corresponds to usage of about 93 Mt/yr (an energy yield from agricultural residues by combustion of 18 GJ/t is assumed [60,65,66]). Regional data on energy from agricultural residues is not available, but if it is assumed to be 3% of bioenergy production in each region, then a rough estimate of the utilization rate can be obtained (the maximum sustainable utilisation was assumed to be 50% as the remainder must be returned to the land for soil health [3]). Combustion of agricultural residues produces 6 wt.% ash [5,65,67], so currently about 6 Mt/yr of ash is produced from agricultural residues.As the estimates of biomass burned for energy production reported in the literature are based on data &gt;10 yrs old, a new estimate of biomass fuel usage has been made (Table 1).

        <p>Perennial bioenergy crops are widely seen as viable source of renewable energy that can contribute to climate change mitigation by substituting for fossil fuels [86,87]. Worldwide, the main perennial energy crops are grasses like miscanthus, switchgrass, reed canary grass and giant reed, and short rotation coppice crops like willow and poplar [88]. In addition, some dedicated energy crops are produced mainly for liquid biofuel and biogas production such as oil seed crops for hydrogenated vegetable oil/biodiesel, cereal crops for bioethanol/biogas, and sugar crops for bioethanol [15]. Advocates of such crops believe that they can be a carbon neutral (and possibly even carbon negative) source of energy if grown on low grade soils, as a proportion of the litter, harvest residues, roots and root exudates are sequestered into recalcitrant soil organic matter [88].Perennial bioenergy crops are widely seen as viable source of renewable energy that can contribute to climate change mitigation by substituting for fossil fuels [86,87].

        <p>The estimate of sewage sludge production around the world is based on the UN population data for 2018 [64]. The amount of sewage sludge generated per capita depends on the proportion of wastewater treated centrally and the level of treatment undertaken, and therefore varies around the globe. Sewage sludge production in N. America, Europe and Oceania is calculated from the EU-27 average of 22.5 kg dry solids per person per year [69]. Sewage sludge production for the rest of the world is calculated from the Chinese average of 4.6 kg dry solids per person per year [70]. This approach is likely to overestimate production in regions where there is less centralised wastewater treatment than in China. The proportion of sewage sludge that is incinerated is based on data for Europe [69], U.S.A. [71], China mainland [70], Hong Kong [72] and Japan [73]. It is assumed that the ash content is 33 wt.% of dry solids [90][91][92].

        <p>Overall global biomass supply and the utilization patterns are presented schematically in Fig. 1. However, dedicated energy crops and some other wastes like animal manure and industrial waste are not shown in Fig. 1 because the datasets are unavailable, although they contribute to bioenergy production. Current biomass/bioenergy supplies are from three sectors: agriculture, forestry and wastes; and only small proportions of agricultural and waste biomass are used for bioenergy purposes (thus there is great potential for future exploitation). In 2017 &gt;90% of biomass used for energy production was burnt as solid fuel [3]. Fig. 2 illustrates the geographical distribution of current biomass incineration and resulting ash production broken-down by feedstock category, together with the estimated maximum future amounts. The breakdown of biomass utilization by geographic region (Fig. 2a) shows that wood fuel is the main biomass feedstock used in Africa, where it is used for traditional cooking and heating [3]. In Europe, large volumes of MSW are burnt to generate energy, whereas in Asia and Americas, main bioenergy supplies are from wood fuel, MSW and wood chips, particles, and residues. The pattern of biomass ash production (Fig. 2c) differs markedly from that for fuel use due to the differing ash contents. MSW incineration is the main source of biomass ash in Americas, Asia, and Europe due to its high ash content. Currently, agricultural residue utilization is low [3], but there is great potential for future bioenergy supply (Fig. 2b), similarly there is scope for increased recovery of energy from MSW [16]. Thus, future biomass ash production is likely to be dominated by MSW and agricultural residue ash.Overall global biomass supply and the utilization patterns are presented schematically in Fig. 1.

        <p>The agricultural residues reported in Table 2 are predominantly food crops grown on uncontaminated land, so the trace element compositions of their residue ashes are not routinely reported in the literature. However, previous work on agricultural residues reviewing 66 grass (monocot) straw and 48 non-grass (eudicot) straw ashes [22] showed that the Cu, Pb, Cd and Hg contents of all these ashes were below the Swedish limits, and most were below the Finnish limits, for use as a forest fertiliser (just one grass straw ash exceeded the Finnish limit for Pb) [119,120]. When organic matter is incinerated there is a concern that polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) may form if Cl is present in the feedstock. Although PCDD/Fs in the feedstock are destroyed by relatively brief exposure to the temperatures within the combustion zone of a modern commercial furnace [121,122], they can also be formed as the combustion gases cool as they leave the combustion zone, if appropriate organic substrates survive their transit through the furnace. There are three main pathways by which a range of PCDD/Fs can form [123][124][125][126]: gas phase formation at 400~800 C [124,125,127], and two surface catalysed pathways that typically occur at 200~400 C [124,[128][129][130]. Production of precursor chlorophenols, and thus potentially PCDD/Fs, initially increases with Cl content of the feedstock at low Cl concentrations, but quickly becomes insensitive to Cl concentration [131].The agricultural residues reported in Table 2 are predominantly food crops grown on uncontaminated land, so the trace element compositions of their residue ashes are not routinely reported in the literature.

        <p>Several current and proposed regulatory limits for PCDD/F concentrations are applied to combustion ashes, commonly defined in terms of toxic equivalents units (TEQs) based on specific toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for individual compounds (International TEF values have been superseded by World Health Organisation TEF values, but the difference is very small and the TEQ values are comparable [134,135]). Limits placed on PCDD/F concentrations are dependent on the intended end use or disposal method. EU limits on ash disposal methods place a limit of 15,000 ng TEQ/kg for disposal to landfill, and above this limit destruction or irreversible transformation of the PCDD/Fs is required [136]. There is a recommendation that the EU limit for ash to be put directly onto or mixed with soil (e.g. road sub-bases, engineering fills, etc.) should be 1000 ng TEQ/kg PCDD/Fs [134]. End of waste criteria have also been applied in the UK to ash from poultry litter incineration for application to land as a fertilizer at 20 ng TEQ/kg [137]. These limits can be compared to PCDD/F concentrations determined in biomass combustion ashes as a way of determining to effect of PCDD/F content on the potential re-use or disposal pathways (Fig. 3).Several current and proposed regulatory limits for PCDD/F concentrations are applied to combustion ashes, commonly defined in terms of toxic equivalents units (TEQs) based on specific toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) for individual compounds (International TEF values have been superseded by World Health Organisation TEF values, but the difference is very small and the TEQ values are comparable [134,135]).

        <p>The mean PCDD/Fs concentrations reported in agricultural ashes deposited in the combustion chamber (4 to 5 separate trials per fuel) were 8, 24 and 12 ng TEQ/kg for triticale (whole crop), wheat straw and hay (from set aside land), respectively [129]. These feedstocks have low transition metal contents, but moderate to high Cl contents, yet combustion in modern furnace results in PCDD/F values in the bulk of the ash that are similar to end of waste criteria applied to poultry litter ashes [129]. This demonstrates potential for agricultural residue combustion ash re-use as fertiliser if combustion conditions are carefully controlled.

In recent years, some studies show that PAHs content in wood ash ranges from 0 (not detected) to 0.733 mg/kg [158,159], which is within regulatory standards (e.g. in Sweden the preliminary PAHs limit is 2 mg/kg for ash utilisation as forestry fertiliser [120] and in the Czech Republic the limit is 6 mg/kg for ash reuse in agriculture soil [158]). Therefore, organic contaminants in virgin woody biomass ash are unlikely to restrict its beneficial reuse.Data for wood ash collected in the early 1990s indicates that the concentrations of other organics of environmental concern (e.g. polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols) are negligible although insufficient data was available to draw a definitive conclusion [156].

        <p>Four separate reports of the chemical composition of recovered wood ash have been identified in the literature [20,94,101].

This limited amount of data makes detailed comparison inappropriate, but the composition is generally similar to other wood ashes (particularly softwood ash), although mean data suggests that recovered wood may contain more MgO, Al2O3 and possibly SiO2, and less K2O and P2O5 than other wood ashes, possibly indicating the presence of soil and construction debris in the feedstock.

        <p>Recovered wood may be partially mixed with plastics and thus increase the potential of PCDD/Fs contamination of combustion ashes [166]. Chimney soot produced in a domestic heating system from painted wood and wood with 2-5% polyvinyl chloride contains PCDD/Fs at level of 380 to 2240 ng TEQ/kg, which is far higher than chimney soot from untreated natural wood (32 ng TEQ/kg) [147]. If the combustion chamber ash exhibits a similar enhancement in PCDD/Fs it is likely to exceed the recommended EU PCDD/Fs content limit on waste to be used in soil (see Fig. 3).Recovered wood may be partially mixed with plastics and thus increase the potential of PCDD/Fs contamination of combustion ashes [166].

        <p>Eight reports of the chemical composition of paper sludge ash have been identified in the literature [94,[167][168][169][170][171][172]. The composition of paper sludge ash is dominated by SiO2 (37%), CaO (26%) and Al2O3 (23%) (see Table 2). Addition of about 50% paper mill or 15% bleached kraft mill sludge to wood fuel (heat equivalents) results in bottom and fly ashes with heavy metal contents similar to that of the wood fuel [156]. It is thus presumed that heavy metal concentrations in paper sludge ashes (whether bleached or not) are comparable to ashes from woody biomass. However, the ash from bleached kraft mill sludge could potentially contain more PCDD/Fs because of their chlorine content in the fuel mix compared to pure forest residues and wood [156].Eight reports of the chemical composition of paper sludge ash have been identified in the literature [94,[167][168][169][170][171][172].

Ash composition controls the ash softening and melting temperatures [22], and thus slagging, fouling and corrosion within the furnace [20,107,200], which effect the thermal conversion efficiency of the furnace and determine its maintenance requirements. It also determines the hazards from, and the potential uses of the ash, and thus the ash reuse / disposal strategy. Therefore, an ash classification system based on elemental composition is a valuable tool that will assist in effective furnace management.

        <p>Subsequently, a simplified version of this tripartite classification system was used that captures the statistically significant differences in composition of forestry and agricultural residues ash [22]. This simplified system considers only the relative proportions of the most abundant constituent in each of the three groups (i.e. CaO, K2O and SiO2). This classification system was used to demonstrate that the chemical compositions of forestry and agricultural residue ashes reflect evolutionary differences between the feedstock plant species. Table 3 shows that the two most abundant elements in most types of biomass ash are either CaO, SiO2 or K2O (the only exception is sugarcane ash, which is SiO2 rich, but Al3O2 is the second most abundant element, relegating K2O third place). This suggests that classification based on the relative abundances of CaO, K2O and SiO2 may be more widely applicable to biomass ash. The mean compositions of the biomass ashes (Table 2) have been used to calculate relative abundances of CaO, K2O and SiO2 and thus create the ternary diagram in Fig. 7. This shows that there are compositional groupings amongst the biomass ash categories: • Ash from monocot plants (cereal crops, sugarcane, and grasses energy crops) are generally dominated by SiO2 content, which is taken up to support their growth.Subsequently, a simplified version of this tripartite classification system was used that captures the statistically significant differences in composition of forestry and agricultural residues ash [22].

        <p>Assessment of these options is primarily directed by chemical composition of the ashes and their relative safety. This is a pre-requisite for cost-benefit analysis and should be used to inform policy improvements and business case for future ash management options. For example, during growth, plants take-up essential nutrients and use them to build biomass. The essential primary and secondary macronutrients for plant growth are N, P, and K and Ca, Mg and S, respectively [206,207]. P and K in soils are not replenished on human timescales by mobilisation from primary minerals or atmospheric deposition and must therefore be added in the form of organic matter (e.g. manure, digestate or compost) and inorganic fertilisers to maintain soil productivity [208][209][210]. Ca, Mg and S can also be growth limiting in some soil types and are added to agricultural soils when required [211][212][213]. After combustion, most of these nutrients remain in the ash, providing an opportunity for their recovery and/or reuse in accordance with the waste hierarchy [214] (see Table 4), but only if contaminant concentrations are acceptable for specific recovery options.Assessment of these options is primarily directed by chemical composition of the ashes and their relative safety. This is a pre-requisite for cost-benefit analysis and should be used to inform policy improvements and business case for future ash management options. For example, during growth, plants take-up essential nutrients and use them to build biomass. The essential primary and secondary macronutrients for plant growth are N, P, and K and Ca, Mg and S, respectively [206,207].

        <p>Ash derived from cereal crop residues is rich in potassium compounds (Table 2: mean 19%), contains modest amounts of phosphate and has very low levels of contaminants, so could potentially be used as a partial fertiliser replacement. A substantial proportion of the potassium is KCl, the common K-mineral phase in potash ore [215][216][217]. It thus has a comparable potassium grade to commercially exploited potash deposits (from 11% to 25% in operating potash mines) [218]. This shows that there is potential for potassium recovery from cereal residue combustion ash. Ash from grass energy crops has similar chemical compositions to cereal crop residue ash and therefore is also a good source material for potassium recovery. b only temperate hardwood bark and softwood bark ashes are considered in this study.Ash derived from cereal crop residues is rich in potassium compounds (Table 2: mean 19%), contains modest amounts of phosphate and has very low levels of contaminants, so could potentially be used as a partial fertiliser replacement.

        <p>In addition to KCl, potassium in ash can also be present as carbonate and sulphates [215][216][217]219]. All three are generally very soluble and can be extracted by hot water leaching. For example leachate from wheat straw ash contains KCl, K2CO3 and K2SO4 in a mass ratio of 12:9:5 [215], which is similar to commercial recovery of potassium from Cl bearing ores [220]. Water leaching is preferable to H2SO4 acid leaching, even though K2SO4 is used in fertiliser mixtures [221,222], because the enhancement in K extraction is small and it may increase leaching of undesirable impurities [219]. Some challenges with water leaching of potassium from biomass ashes are: (1) unburnt carbon in ash can decrease K recovery by about 9-19% [219]; and (2) the proper disposal of residues and waste brines [216].In addition to KCl, potassium in ash can also be present as carbonate and sulphates [215][216][217]219].

        <p>Ash from grass and cereal crop residues is about 50% SiO2 so its use as secondary pozzolan has been widely investigated.

Initial research findings suggest that partial replacement of cement with agriculture residue ash may improve the engineering properties of concrete/mortar (compressive/tensile/flexural strength, splitting tensile strength, chloride/sulfate permeability, etc.), provided the amount of cement replacement is carefully managed [98,224,226,229,230], however, further work is still required to verify the long-term performance of such materials.Ash from grass and cereal crop residues is about 50% SiO2 so its use as secondary pozzolan has been widely investigated.

        <p>Amorphous and fine silica particles with large surface area are widely used in industry, for example in the production of adhesives, plastics, sealants, coatings, inks, toner, cosmetics, food additives and defoamers [231], so recovery of SiO2 from grass and cereal crop ash has also been investigated.

        <p>While there has been much research on materials recovery from grass and cereal crop ash, the recovery of a single high-value product will be unattractive if it leaves a large volume residue whose disposal is more problematic than the original ash. There is little published work on multiproduct recovery from ash, but a notable exception is a the recovery of amorphous silica from grass straw ash using strong alkali, which is compatible with subsequent recovery of CaCO3 leaving only a small volume of residue [231], particular as the process appears to be compatible with an initial water extraction step for K2O recovery.While there has been much research on materials recovery from grass and cereal crop ash, the recovery of a single high-value product will be unattractive if it leaves a large volume residue whose disposal is more problematic than the original ash.

        <p>Herbaceous eudicot residue ashes have similar K2O contents to grasses and cereal residues but higher CaO and lower SiO2 contents (Table 2). Thus, eudicot residue ash is a good candidate for potassium recovery as, for example, the K-minerals in cotton straw ash are mainly KCl, K2SO4 and KNaSO4 and ~70% is extractable by hot water leaching [216]. There has also been limited work on the use of herbaceous eudicot residue ashes as secondary pozzolans (work has been conducted on cotton straw, sunflower seed shell and soybean straw ashes), but the results have been mixed, possibly due to variability in the fine silica content [230,239,240].Herbaceous eudicot residue ashes have similar K2O contents to grasses and cereal residues but higher CaO and lower SiO2 contents (Table 2).

        <p>Ash from the three categories of woody biomass (temperate hardwood, tropical hardwood, and softwood) contains many nutrient elements required for plant growth, particularly Ca, K, P, and Mg (Table 2). It also contains relatively low levels of toxic trace elements and organic contaminants (as discussed in subsection 3.2). The principal component of all wood ash is CaO, which represents about a third of the ash averaged across all wood types. Hardwood ash also contains about 20% K2O and just over 10% SiO2 (differences between temperate and tropical hardwood ash are small).

        <p>Currently the most common beneficial use of wood ash is as soil conditioner and fertilizer, rather than for recovery of specific valuable components [7,[241][242][243][244][245][246]. Due to its high Ca content (as CaO, CaOH and CaCO3), it is particularly suitable for application to acid soil, such as tropical and forest soils [39]. Neutralising acidic soil reduces Al and Mn toxicity to plants by making lower solubility Mn species more stable and reducing phosphate fixation (fixation by Al and Fe reduces P availability to plants at low pH) [39,247,248]. Nutrient deficient soils, such as tropical red soils [249][250][251], may also gain from other nutrients in the ash (e.g. P and Mg). In addition, modest ash additions can increase soil bacterial numbers and stimulate N-mineralization by reducing the pH stress on microbial communities [252][253][254]. However, excessive dosing needs to be avoided to prevent salinity build-up (particularly with tropical hardwood ash which has a higher Cl2O content than other wood ashes) or overdosing with nutrients [206,255,256],Currently the most common beneficial use of wood ash is as soil conditioner and fertilizer, rather than for recovery of specific valuable components [7,[241][242][243][244][245][246].

        <p>The K2O grade of hardwood ash is in the same range as commercially exploited potash deposits, while the K2O grade of softwood ash is at the lower end of that range [218]. Further, ~60% of the total potassium in softwood ash is rapidly soluble in water at room temperature, so there is potential to recover K2O for use in fertiliser [258]. It has also been demonstrated that wood ash can be used as partial feedstock to form zeolites, exploiting the ash as a source of both potassium and alkalinity [259,260]. Similarly, it been demonstrated that wood ash can be used in the manufacture of construction materials (e.g. as partial replacement of lightweight aggregate or, exploiting their pozzolanic properties in cement blends or directly in mortars) [261][262][263][264][265]. The mass percentage of wood ash in such products needs careful regulation as wood ash appears to be less suitable for such applications than fly ashes from coal [266]. However, as the unburnt carbon content of wood ashes is one of the limiting factors [262], the ash from modern commercial biomass power stations where there is careful combustion control may be more suitable than the ash used many older studies. Another proposed application of wood ash that exploits its Ca-alkalinity is to produce sorbents for end-of-pipe CO2 separation and capture [267,268].

        <p>Ferrous and non-ferrous metals (e.g. Al, Cu, Zn) are routinely recovered from the MSW bottom ash from energy to waste plants, leaving a material suitable for restricted use as aggregate [48,[303][304][305][306][307][308][309]. Several studies have shown construction materials made with bottom ash and bottom ash reuse as aggregate in pavement applications meet the regulatory standards [194,308,310], but an environmental risk assessment is often required before use is permitted [309]. There has also been research into exploiting the pozzolanic properties of MSW bottom ash [194,[310][311][312][313]. However, its use in cementitious materials is not straight-forward because it contains chlorides, sulfates, metallic Al and Cu, glass particles and possibly residual organics that are deleterious to cement hydration and the strength of the mortars [179,311,[314][315][316]. Thus, further pre-treatment of bottom ash will probably be required before such use. Rare earth elements are also found in bottom ash but the concentrations are too low to recover based on current technology [48].Ferrous and non-ferrous metals (e.g. Al, Cu, Zn) are routinely recovered from the MSW bottom ash from energy to waste plants, leaving a material suitable for restricted use as aggregate [48,[303][304][305][306][307][308][309]. Several studies have shown construction materials made with bottom ash and bottom ash reuse as aggregate in pavement applications meet the regulatory standards [194,308,310], but an environmental risk assessment is often required before use is permitted [309]. There has also been research into exploiting the pozzolanic properties of MSW bottom ash [194,[310][311][312][313]. However, its use in cementitious materials is not straight-forward because it contains chlorides, sulfates, metallic Al and Cu, glass particles and possibly residual organics that are deleterious to cement hydration and the strength of the mortars [179,311,[314][315][316]. Thus, further pre-treatment of bottom ash will probably be required before such use. Rare earth elements are also found in bottom ash but the concentrations are too low to recover based on current technology [48].</p>
        <p>Heavy metal recovery from MSW fly ash is technically viable via thermal or hydrometallurgical methods [187,[317][318][319]. About 70% Cu, 80% Zn, &gt;90% Pb and &gt;92% Cd can be leached from the fly ash using HCl solution [49], and the subsequent Cu separation from the acid leachate is viable but the Zn separation needs further refinement because of the coextraction of Fe, Pb and Cd [189]. However, developing a reuse strategy for MSW fly-ash is far more challenging than it is for bottom ash, as modern waste-to-energy plants use sophisticated air pollution control (APC) equipment (dry, semidry or wet scrubbers; electrostatic precipitators; bag filters; fabric filters, and cyclones) to prevent pollutant release to atmosphere. The result is that the fly ash is often combined with other APC residues, and the product varies in composition depending the additives used from plant to plant (e.g. lime, activated carbon, etc.) [320]. As a result APC residue is usually handled as a hazardous waste unless treated [321] (recently developed commercial treatments involve either carbonation and incorporation into a binder [316,321,322], or plasma treatment to extract hydrochloric acid and separate hazardous elements [323][324][325], to produce secondary aggregates).Heavy metal recovery from MSW fly ash is technically viable via thermal or hydrometallurgical methods [187,[317][318][319].

        <p>This review shows that that much has been published on the current production and properties of, and reuse options for ash derived from the common biomass feedstocks used for energy generation. However, knowledge gaps and research opportunities remain, particularly with regards to the beneficial reuse of ash. Currently industrial scale reuse of ash is limited to direct use of forestry residue bottom ash as a fertiliser/soil conditioner, and the recovery of secondary aggregates from MSW bottom ash by simple mechanical processing. The potential to use biomass ash as a pozzolan or to incorporate it into cementitious materials has been clearly demonstrated, but more research on the long-term durability of these material is needed. Looking forward, there are major opportunities to recover valuable elements from biomass ash for return to the circular economy, but work is needed to make recovery economically beneficial and eliminate secondary wastes from the recovery processes. Potentially, multiple valuable elements can be recovered in a sequence of compatible recovery steps, which would maximise economic return while minimise secondary wastes, but more research is required. Finally, beneficial use of biomass fly ash is currently far more challenging than bottom ash due to higher concentrations of problematic constituents. Fortunately fly ash is usually produced in smaller volumes than bottom ash, but nonetheless it should be a target for future research.This review shows that that much has been published on the current production and properties of, and reuse options for ash derived from the common biomass feedstocks used for energy generation.

        <p>• Combustion of virgin biomass in modern well-run furnace can produce ash with negligible persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which makes direct application to land possible. Agricultural residue ashes contain abundant potassium, modest amounts of phosphate, and very low levels of contaminant metals so could potentially be used as a fertiliser additive. Forestry ashes are rich in CaO which is used as a soil conditioner, but their slightly higher contaminant metals levels may restrict their direct use to forestry soils.• Combustion of virgin biomass in modern well-run furnace can produce ash with negligible persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which makes direct application to land possible.
