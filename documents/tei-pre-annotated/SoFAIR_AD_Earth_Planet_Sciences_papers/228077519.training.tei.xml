        <p>The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is scheduled for launch in February 2020 to monitor air quality (AQ) at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution from a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) for the first time. With the development of UV-visible spectrometers at sub-nm spectral resolution and sophisticated retrieval algorithms, estimates of the column amounts of atmospheric pollutants (O 3 , NO 2 , SO 2 , HCHO, CHOCHO, and aerosols) can be obtained. To date, all the UV-visible satellite missions monitoring air quality have been in low Earth orbit (LEO), allowing one to two observations per day. With UV-visible instruments on GEO platforms, the diurnal variations of these pollutants can now be determined. Details of the GEMS mission are presented, including instrumentation, scientific algorithms, predicted performance, and applications for air quality forecasts through data assimilation. GEMS will be on board the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite 2 (GEO-KOMPSAT-2) satellite series, which also hosts the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager 2 (GOCI-2). These three instruments will provide synergistic science products to better understand air quality, meteorology, the long-range transport of air pollutants, emission source distributions, and chemical processes. Faster sampling rates at higher spatial resolution will increase the probability of finding cloud-free pixels, leading to more observations of aerosols and trace gases than is possible from LEO. GEMS will be joined by NASA's Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and ESA's Sentinel-4 to form a GEO AQ satellite constellation in early 2020s, coordinated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS).The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is scheduled for launch in February 2020 to monitor air quality (AQ) at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution from a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) for the first time.

        <p>ir pollution is increasingly understood to be a global issue, requiring an understanding of pollution sources, transport, and transformation from local to regional to global scales (IPCC 2013). Polluting gases such as ozone (O 3 ; see appendix for acronyms), and aerosols, particularly fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), are known to be major risk factors for public health (Cohen et al. 2017;Brauer et al. 2016). Half of the global population lives in Asia, and is exposed to high levels of air pollution. This fact has led to increased interest in regional air quality (AQ). Thus, systematic observations of ozone, aerosols, and their precursors [nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), formaldehyde (HCHO), etc.] over wide areas, together with meteorological observations, are critical to public health and environmental policy in this region.ir pollution is increasingly understood to be a global issue, requiring an understanding of pollution sources, transport, and transformation from local to regional to global scales (IPCC 2013).

        <p>Monitoring AQ from satellites has played a key role in understanding the status of air pollution loadings and trends on the regional to global scale, by providing information on E3 pollutant amounts, emission, and transport in a quantitative manner (e.g., Levelt et al. 2018). Figure 1 summarizes the capabilities of satellite instruments measuring atmospheric composition using remote sensing with respect to temporal and spatial resolution. In the late 1970s, total O 3 was measured successfully by the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet radiometer (SBUV) and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) (Heath et al. 1975). Technology has since advanced to measure important tropospheric trace gas concentrations [O 3 , NO 2 , SO 2 , HCHO, carbon monoxide (CO)] by a number of satellite sensors including the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) 1 and 2 (Burrows et al. 1993;Munro et al. 2016), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) (Levelt et al. 2018), the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY) (Bovensmann et al. 1999), the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) (Flynn et al. 2014), and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) (Veefkind et al. 2012), among others (see supplement for further details).Monitoring AQ from satellites has played a key role in understanding the status of air pollution loadings and trends on the regional to global scale, by providing information on E3 pollutant amounts, emission, and transport in a quantitative manner (e.g., Levelt et al. 2018).

        <p>In addition to a growing number of target species, from just O 3 (TOMS) to the multiple trace gas species (GOME, SCIAMACHY, and OMI), spatial resolution has improved from the 100 km scale (GOME) to resolutions of just a few km (TROPOMI), and temporal resolution has improved from days to twice daily (measured by IR). The OMI dataset has been analyzed extensively to understand AQ around the globe, and to derive emission sources (e.g., Levelt et al. 2018;Duncan et al. 2016;McLinden et al. 2016). Using SCIAMACHY and OMI for morning and afternoon orbit measurements, respectively, Boersma et al. (2008) demonstrated the importance of multiple satellite measurements in a single day for improving model accuracy.In addition to a growing number of target species, from just O 3 (TOMS) to the multiple trace gas species (GOME, SCIAMACHY, and OMI), spatial resolution has improved from the 100 km scale (GOME) to resolutions of just a few km (TROPOMI), and temporal resolution has improved from days to twice daily (measured by IR).

        <p>Aerosol properties have been observed extensively by a number of LEO satellite instruments, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; Levy et al. 2013) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS; Jackson et al. 2013). High-temporal-and high-spatial-resolution observations of aerosol properties have been available from geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) instruments: the Meteorological Imager (MI) and the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) on board the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (GK)-1, also known as Communication, Oceanography and Meteorology Satellite (COMS), and, more recently, from the AHI over Asia (Kim et al. 2008;Kim et al. 2016;Choi et al. 2016;Choi and Ho 2015;Lim et al. 2018). Long-term validation of the GOCI aerosol optical depth (AOD) indicates good agreement with ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements, with correlation coefficients of ~0.9 (M. Choi et al. 2018). A long-term decreasing trend in AOD over East Asia beginning in 2011 has been identified (e.g., Kim et al. 2017). Diurnal variations of aerosol properties are captured well by GOCI (Lennartson et al. 2018).

        <p>To date, no observations of trace gases at high temporal resolution from GEO have been made to complement the high-temporal-resolution aerosol measurements. Fishman et al. (2008) and Bovensmann et al. (2004) discussed the importance of a GEO mission to capture the diurnal variations of air pollutant concentrations due to photochemistry, time-dependent emissions, and daily meteorological variability. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 bottom panel, which shows the diurnal variations of gas concentrations simulated by CMAQ, together with AOD measured on 25 May 2016. This represents a long-range transport case resulting in high concentration during the joint Korea-United States KORUS-AQ field campaign (Lee et al. 2019;Choi et al. 2019). KORUS-AQ integrated models and measurements from ground-based, airborne, shipborne, and satellite platforms to diagnose AQ problems in Korea [National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER); NIER and NASA 2017]. Such scientific findings along with societal demands have led to projects aimed at providing hourly observations of trace gas column abundance from space. To convert column density to surface concentration, vertical profile information is very important, as discussed later. The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is planned to be launched no later than March 2020, to monitor AQ at high spatial and temporal resolution from GEO over Asia.

        <p>The primary objective of GEMS is to provide columnar measurements of key AQ components-that is, tropospheric O 3 , aerosols, and their precursors [NO 2 , SO 2 , HCHO, and glyoxal (CHOCHO)]-at high temporal and spatial resolution. NO 2 is a precursor of tropospheric O 3 and nitrate aerosols, as is SO 2 for sulfate aerosols. HCHO and CHOCHO provide information on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are precursors of tropospheric O 3 and organic aerosols (Marais et al. 2012;Zhu et al. 2014). Measurements of HCHO and CHOCHO reflect emissions of biogenic and anthropogenic VOCs including isoprene, monoterpene, and aromatics (DiGangi et al. 2012;Vrekoussis et al. 2010).The primary objective of GEMS is to provide columnar measurements of key AQ components-that is, tropospheric O 3 , aerosols, and their precursors [NO 2 , SO 2 , HCHO, and glyoxal (CHOCHO)]-at high temporal and spatial resolution.

GEMS and GOCI-2 instruments on board the GK-2B satellite will make up half of the GK-2 satellite series. The other satellite in the series is the GK-2A, a dedicated spacecraft for the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) at the same longitude 128.25°E (Choi and Ho 2015). The GK-2A was launched successfully in December 2018, and the GK-2B will be launched in February 2020. Table 1 lists the general specifications of instruments on board the GK-1 and GK-2 satellite series. Synchronous measurements of air pollutants by GEMS, together with the meteorological variables, aerosol properties, and ocean properties from AMI and GOCI-2 will provide important synergistic information for the Asia-Pacific region. These three instruments will contribute to a better scientific understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of pollutants, emission sources, transboundary pollution, and interactions between meteorology and atmospheric chemistry. The frequent observations of GEMS will also increase the number of trace gas observations and improve the accuracy of AQ forecasts, top-down emission rates, and AQ reanalysis datasets.

        <p>User requirements, instrument design, and operation. To achieve the GEMS mission objectives, a set of user requirements were developed after extensive sensitivity studies and data analysis of previous satellite measurements. Nominal spatial resolution is 7 km × 8 km for gases and 3.5 km × 8 km for aerosols over Seoul, South Korea. To detect the trace gases of interest, the spectral coverage of GEMS was chosen to be 300-500 nm at 0.6 nm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) with 3 samples/band. Typical vertical optical depths (ODs) for relevant trace gases and aerosols in the GEMS spectral range are shown in Fig. 3. Low-and high-frequency signals can be separated to provide ODs for aerosols and trace gases, respectively. Additional details of user requirement analysis can be found in the supplement. GEMS, as shown in Fig. 4, is a step-and-stare UV-visible imaging spectrometer, with a Schmidt telescope and Öffner spectrometer. A UV-enhanced charge coupled device (CCD) with 2,000 × 1,000 pixels combines signals from 2,000 north (N)-south (S) spatial pixels at a given east (E)-west (W) scan position, and 1,000 spectral channels in the spectral range 300-500 nm.User requirements, instrument design, and operation.

        <p>The field of regard (FOR) of GEMS was chosen to cover most of Asia (5°S-45°N in latitude and 75°-145°E in longitude, as shown in Fig. 5. GEMS scans its E-W coverage in 701 steps over 30 min, and transmits data to ground during the next 30-min imaging time of GOCI-2. While the maximum E-W scan angle is fixed (~45° in longitude at equator), the scan pattern is flexible within the FOR, with nominal daily, central, and west scan patterns as shown in Fig. 5. For example, with the west scan pattern, AQ over India can be observed in late afternoon after sunset in Seoul. To increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a reduction of the scan region by half will double the available integration time in the same amount of observing time. In the case of an important event, more frequent scanning over a narrow region, with as short as 15-min resolution, is also possible. GEMS will produce approximately 11 million spectra per day on average.The field of regard (FOR) of GEMS was chosen to cover most of Asia (5°S-45°N in latitude and 75°-145°E in longitude, as shown in Fig. 5.

        <p>AMFs are a key parameter to convert slant column density (SCD) to vertical column density (VCD). To meet time constraints for NRT data delivery, AMFs for NO 2 , SO 2 , HCHO, and CHOCHO are based on a lookup table (LUT) approach. LUTs are constructed as a function of time, location, observation geometry, surface albedo, etc. Depending on species, spatial and temporal resolutions, cloud and aerosol properties, and vertical profiles are considered differently in the AMF LUTs. Scattering weights are calculated using VLIDORT, and vertical shape factors are constructed as a function of location and time. Details can be found in the subsections below. Ancillary data including snow and ice cover are available from AMI retrievals and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC; http://nsidc.org).

        <p>Tropospheric and total O 3 . To retrieve total ozone amount (TO3), the TOMS, version 9, algorithm is adopted (Haffner et al. 2015). This algorithm includes improvements to TOMS, version 8.5, previously applied to OMI. For the O 3 retrieval, GEMS uses reflectivity at 317.5 nm, derived by linear extrapolation of reflectivity at 340 and 380 nm. The optimal estimation (OE) method is then used at two wavelengths, 312.35 and 331.06 nm, to correct for the ozone profile error. The use of OE is the main difference from the TOMS, version 8.5, which retrieves TO3 using a wavelength pair at 317.5 and 331.2 nm and reflectivity obtained at 331 nm (McPeters et al. 2015). Ozone profile information is determined from ozone spectral line fitting in the window 300-340 nm (Rodgers 2000;Liu et al. 2010;Bak et al. 2013).

        <p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). The NO 2 algorithm is based on the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique fitting spectral optical depths of NO 2 in the 432-450 nm window to obtain SCDs (Hong et al. 2017a). Troposphere-stratosphere separation for NO 2 is performed every hour following the work of Bucsela et al. (2013) and Geddes et al. (2018). SCDs are converted to VCDs using hourly AMFs (Palmer et al. 2001). For AMF calculations, hourly NO 2 profile shape factors are obtained from a chemical transport model (CTM), Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry Model (WRF-Chem; Grell et al. 2011) with the 28 km × 28 km horizontal resolution for the GEMS domain. For pollution hot spots such as Seoul and Beijing, the NO 2 concentrations measured at the ground networks will be utilized to enhance the accuracy and spatial resolution of the a priori profile. Earlier work has shown that an explicit aerosol representation in the retrieval algorithm greatly improves the quality of retrieved NO 2 data (Lin et al. 2014(Lin et al. , 2015;;Liu et al. 2019). Hong et al. (2017b) investigated the impact of aerosols on the NO 2 AMF and found that aerosol-layer height is particularly important, with some contribution from aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) and AOD. Additionally, a new attempt has been made to obtain NO 2 profiles for high concentration regions using multiple fitting windows across the UV-visible spectrum (Hong 2018).

        <p>Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ). The SO 2 algorithm fits the spectrum over the 310-326 nm (310-340 nm in volcanic regions) window for planetary boundary layer (PBL) SO 2 SCD retrievals using a hybrid algorithm based on DOAS and PCA (Li et al. 2013). The PCA algorithm can reduce noise and bias by using a set of PCs extracted directly from satellite radiance data for "clean sectors" that are free of SO 2 emissions. However, in cases where a clean sector is contaminated with high AOD, O 3 , or SO 2 , large uncertainties occur in the SO 2 SCD retrieval (Yang et al. 2018). The hybrid algorithm can reduce these uncertainties by using the DOAS method to filter the SO 2 -contaminated pixels and determine clean sectors, particularly when high concentrations of these interfering pollutants are unintentionally included in a clean sector or there are not enough clean sector pixels in the GEMS domain. The hybrid algorithm first uses the DOAS technique to determine clean sector for extracting principle components (PCs). Then these PCs are fitted to measured radiances with the cross sections to retrieve SO 2 SCDs using the PCA method. For AMF calculations, box profile shape with top altitude at 1 km is assumed for PBL SO 2 , while similar box profiles with top at up to 15 km are for volcanic SO 2 based on NASA climatology.Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ).

        <p>HCHO and CHOCHO. The HCHO and CHOCHO retrieval algorithms are based on a nonlinear fitting method, referred to as direct fitting (DF), in the fitting windows of 328.5-356.5 nm and 435-461 nm, respectively (Chance et al. 2000;González Abad et al. 2016, 2015;Chan Miller et al. 2014;Kwon et al. 2017Kwon et al. , 2019)). For AMF calculations, vertical profile shapes are from the GEOS-Chem driven by MERRA. Kwon et al. (2017) showed that the effect of aerosols on AMF was nonnegligible in retrievals of HCHO columns. This is particularly true for East Asia, where aerosol and other trace gas concentrations vary considerably in time and space. Hourly AMF calculations are planned to use a fast LUT approach with the GEMS aerosol products. Finally, a systematic bias correction is performed for each pixel, but it can be avoided by using measured radiances over a clean background region as a reference spectrum for radiance fitting.HCHO and CHOCHO.

Following aerosol type classification using UV and visible AIs, AOD and SSA are retrieved using measurements at 354 and 388 nm (Herman et al. 1997). Using the retrieved AOD and SSA as a priori, AEH is retrieved by OE using six selected wavelengths, including the O 2 -O 2 absorption band at 477 nm.

However, GEMS can provide aerosol properties such as AOD and radiative absorptivity even over bright land surfaces. As the time difference between AMI and GEMS measurements is &lt;10 min, synergy between the two instruments is readily achieved considering the typical lifetime of aerosols and clouds in the atmosphere.Merging data from GEMS with those from AMI and/or GOCI-2 can significantly improve the accuracy of aerosol products by adopting the cloud mask from the IR channels of AMI, combining L2 aerosol products from GOCI-2 and AMI, and combining L1b data from all three instruments.

        <p>Clouds. Cloud information is critical to most of the GEMS products as the accuracy and retrievability of trace gas products is subject to cloud effects (Ahmad et al. 2004;Antón and Loyola 2011;Bucsela et al. 2013;van Diedenhoven et al. 2008). GEMS cloud products (ECF and CCP) are based on the Lambertian cloud model (Stammes et al. 2008). The DOAS algorithm for the O 2 -O 2 absorption line at 477 nm is used to retrieve the ECF and CCP from the O 2 -O 2 column amounts above clouds (Acarreta et al. 2004;Stammes et al. 2008;Veefkind et al. 2016). ECF can also be converted to spectral CRF, the ratio of cloud radiance to total observed radiance, for use in the different spectral fitting windows of the trace gases.Clouds.

        <p>Surface reflectivity. Although surface reflectance is an important factor in retrievals of the atmospheric composition, many previous studies have assumed isotropic surface reflectance (e.g., Kim et al. 2007;Bak et al. 2013;Kwon et al. 2017). One advantage of GEMS over LEO instruments lies in its ability to derive directional reflectance using high-frequency observations over short periods (e.g., a day). Two kinds of surface reflectance products are retrieved from GEMS: the geometry-dependent Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GLER) and the daily bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF; Lee and Yoo 2018). The GLER algorithm will compile clear-sky composite reflectance from GEMS, and the BRDF model will compile GEMS measurements for various illumination-viewing geometries at each pixel. The assumption of Lambertian reflection can lead to biases in GLER retrievals using OMI L1b data (Vasilkov et al. 2017). Retrieved GLER results using OMI L1b data lead to relative errors of 0.024 and a RMSE of 0.029, compared to MODIS L2 products. The uncertainty approaches 20% for SZA and viewing zenith angle (VZA) &gt; 60° and for turbid conditions. The parameters of the kernel-driven BRDF model are derived by statistical fitting (Lucht et al. 2000;Roujean et al. 1992).Surface reflectivity.

        <p>Algorithm tests. The performance of the GEMS L2 algorithm was tested using one year of OMI L1b data for 2005 as a proxy dataset prior to the launch of GEMS, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Most of the GEMS retrievals are well correlated with the ground-based and/or operational products of OMI and MODIS, with most of the data points falling near the 1:1 line. Figure 6a shows retrieved tropospheric O 3 compared with ozonesonde observations at Pohang, Hong Kong, Sepang, and Isfahan (Fig. 6a). Tropospheric O 3 shows high concentration in East Asia and northeast India in particular, and low near the equator and Tibetan Plateau. Total ozone shows excellent agreement as shown in Fig. 6b. Total NO 2 VCD in Fig. 6c are higher over mega cities, where systematic overestimation is due to the use of different spectroscopy, slit function characterizations and a reference radiance spectrum for fitting procedures. The SO 2 comparisons in Fig. 6d shows large values over eastern China and reflect Anatahan volcano in April 2005. Agreements are reasonable despite of weak signals and different algorithms. Further validations are needed with surface SO 2 measurements. HCHO in Fig. 6e shows polluted region in Asia, especially in Indochina and Indonesia. HCHO comparison shows good agreements despite different algorithms, where negative values are shown on purpose to indicate uncertainties for both GEMS and OMI. AOD was compared with AERONET within the FOR and shows reasonable results considering the coarse spatial resolution of OMI, as shown in Fig. 6e. The scattered data points for UVI in Fig. 6g are primarily caused by the effect of LUT-based cloud corrections.

        <p>Top-down emission estimates. Bottom-up emission rates (BUEs) are critical for accurate AQ forecasts by CTMs. BUE inventories including the Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS), the Regional Emission inventory in Asia (REAS), and the Comprehensive Regional Emissions inventory for Atmospheric Transport Experiment (CREATE), the Multi-Resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) have improved significantly to date (Lee et al. 2011;Kurokawa et al. 2013;Ohara et al. 2007;Woo et al. 2013;Li et al. 2017). Recent BUEs have more comprehensive list of fuels, sectors, pollutants with better estimation parameters, such as newer energy statistics, local emission factors, finer spatial surrogates, and so on. However, the uncertainties of BUE data are still relatively high because they are typically estimated based on the statistical summaries of human activities, a limited number of emission factors, and the application of control measures (Li et al. 2017). In addition, the long lead time of annual BUE compilation delays timely updates with year-to-year trends and daily human activities.Top-down emission estimates.

        <p>TDEs will clearly benefit from the more frequent observations of GEMS. With TDE estimates, an evaluation of AQ using inverse modeling can be performed to improve existing emission information in a timely manner with better accuracy (Mijling et al. 2013). Long-term satellite measurements can also contribute to emission rates by detecting missing emission sources and hot spots (Fioletov et al. 2011;McLinden et al. 2016). Increasingly stringent AQ improvement policies in China, Japan, and Korea have led to rapidly changing BUE estimates of source magnitude and spatial distributions in these regions. The long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution of GEMS observations will enable monitoring of AQ changes over northeast Asia due to the adoption of national emission control policies (Duncan et al. 2016;Souri et al. 2017).TDEs will clearly benefit from the more frequent observations of GEMS. With TDE estimates, an evaluation of AQ using inverse modeling can be performed to improve existing emission information in a timely manner with better accuracy (Mijling et al. 2013).

        <p>Chemical weather forecasts and data assimilation. The GEMS-retrieved products will be utilized by the Korean Air Quality Forecast System (KAQFS) being developed under the framework of the Korean National Strategic PM Project launched in 2017. To enhance the accuracy of short-term (24-48 h) AQ forecasts over South Korea, accurate initial conditions (ICs) are of critical importance. The KAQFS currently uses the GOCI AODs with ground-based PM measurements for aerosols, which has demonstrated good prediction performance for PM 10 and PM 2.5 over South Korea (Lee 2018). Ongoing work seeks to further enhance forecasting performances for gases including O 3 and precursors, by improving accuracy of ICs and better constraining emissions using hourly data. To accomplish the preparation of the ICs and improve their accuracy, GEMS hourly data will be used together with the surface concentration measurements from ground-based observation networks in Asia.Chemical weather forecasts and data assimilation.

        <p>The importance of multisatellite data assimilation was demonstrated by the successful optimization of initial concentration and emission fields using the KORUS-AQ campaign dataset (Miyazaki et al. 2019). The value of a GEO satellite dataset for DA has been demonstrated for NO 2 and O 3 (Liu et al. 2017;Zoogman et al. 2011) with observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), and for aerosols with GOCI (Park et al. 2014;Saide et al. 2014). Key technical components of these systems are the development of the DA techniques and adequate observation operators. Currently, DA techniques based on optimal interpolation with Kalman filters, the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D VAR) methods, and ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs) have been developed and applied to the KAQFS.The importance of multisatellite data assimilation was demonstrated by the successful optimization of initial concentration and emission fields using the KORUS-AQ campaign dataset (Miyazaki et al. 2019).

        <p>An ensemble-based meteorology-chemistry coupled DA system has been developed by interfacing WRF-Chem with the maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF; Županski 2005). Park et al. (2015) showed that, in the coupled DA system, the cross-variable components of forecast error covariance made physically meaningful adjustments to all the control variables. They also showed that the coupled error covariance allowed cross-component impacts (e.g., Lim et al. 2015;Lee et al. 2017). These studies have demonstrated the benefits of using an ensemble-based coupled meteorology-chemistry DA to improve the analysis fields of both meteorological and chemical variables. It is expected that the aerosol and trace gas observations from GEMS will further improve the performance of coupled meteorology-chemistry models in forecasting both weather and AQ by providing tighter observational constraints on the DA through the high density of GEMS measurements. The GEMS observations are anticipated to be utilized in many applications including AQ forecasts, AQ reanalysis systems, radiative forcing estimation, and so on (e.g., Marécal et al. 2015;Lee et al. 2016;Benedetti et al. 2009;Inness et al. 2013;IPCC 2013;Lee et al. 2014).An ensemble-based meteorology-chemistry coupled DA system has been developed by interfacing WRF-Chem with the maximum likelihood ensemble filter (MLEF; Županski 2005).

        <p>Public service. GEMS will provide a revolutionary public service by improving AQ forecasts, enabling early warning systems, and providing AQ data to all regions, both urban and rural. Hourly GEMS L2 datasets will be distributed to the public through multiple platforms including smartphones. For public use, AOD data from satellite measurements can be converted to surface PM 2.5 and PM 10 using CTM results, statistical analysis, and machine learning (e.g., Xu et al. 2015;Seo et al. 2015;Park et al. 2019). A similar algorithm under development at NIER will be applied to trace gas measurements. GEMS can also provide AQ data for countries such as North Korea where measurements have not been available to date, or developing countries where measurements are sparse. In combination with existing datasets, GEMS data can be utilized to fill the data gap in space, and assess the impact of PM on public health, traffic on urban pollution, power plants on regional pollution, ship emissions on marine pollution, and O 3 on crop yields. It is anticipated that GEMS data will also lead to a better environmentally informed society and contribute to environmental policy and international treaties.Public service.
