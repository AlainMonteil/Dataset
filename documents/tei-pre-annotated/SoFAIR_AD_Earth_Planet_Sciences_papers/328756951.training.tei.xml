        <p>How an earthquake rupture propagates strongly influences potentially destructive ground shaking. Complex ruptures often involve slip along multiple faults, masking information on the frictional behaviour of fault zones. Geometrically smooth ocean transform fault plate boundaries offer a favourable environment to study fault dynamics, because strain is accommodated along a single, wide fault zone that offsets homogeneous geology. Here we present an analysis of the 2016 M7.1 earthquake on the Romanche fracture zone in the equatorial Atlantic, using data from both nearby seafloor seismometers and global seismic networks. We show that this rupture had two phases: (1) upward and eastward propagation towards a weaker region where the transform fault intersects the mid-ocean ridge, then (2) unusual back-propagation westwards at super-shear speed toward the centre of the fault. We suggest that deep rupture into weak fault segments facilitated greater seismic slip on shallow locked zones. This highlights that even earthquakes along a single distinct fault zone can be highly dynamic. Observations of back-propagating ruptures are sparse, and the possibility of reverse propagation is largely absent in rupture simulations and unaccounted for in hazard assessments.How an earthquake rupture propagates strongly influences potentially destructive ground shaking.

        <p>In the residual waveforms, we fit an earlier pulse with an additional sub-event, which increases overall variance reduction by 20%, statistically significant at 95% confidence (Note S4). This Mw 6.7 sub-event ruptured earlier (∆% = 13 s) than the larger sub-event, with its centroid ~40 km east of the epicentre. We refer to the earlier, smaller sub-event as SE1 and the later, larger sub-event as SE2. In contrast to early indications of a slow unilateral rupture, the location and timing of sub-events indicate a faster, more complex rupture. The resulting source-time function is similar to that from automated teleseismic analyses 24 (Figure 2c).In the residual waveforms, we fit an earlier pulse with an additional sub-event, which increases overall variance reduction by 20%, statistically significant at 95% confidence (Note S4).

        <p>To verify our source model, we inverted teleseismic waveforms for a slip-rate model 25 of the Romanche earthquake (see Methods). This model requires a sub-vertical, south-dipping fault plane (~78° dip) with deep initiation, consistent with our RMTs and hypocentre estimate, respectively. The rupture evolution over time (Figure 3a) shows a low slip-rate (&lt;2 cm/s) early on (∆% = 0-8 s), similar to other large OTF earthquakes 16 . At ∆% = 8-14 s, an emergent phase of slip (4 cm/s) occurs ~35 km east of the hypocentre at shallow depth (SE1).

        <p>Bilateral super-and sub-shear ruptures were inferred for the 2013 Mw 7.5 Craig, Alaska earthquake 20 . If we assume a similar configuration for the Romanche earthquake, failure of Paper accepted for publication in Nature Geoscience on 26 June 2020 the larger failed asperity (SE2) must have propagated very slowly (! ! ≈ 1 km/s), requiring, for example, a dissipative mechanism in ductile mantle 26 ; however, the earthquake ruptured above the 600°C isotherm (Figure 4).Bilateral super-and sub-shear ruptures were inferred for the 2013 Mw 7.5 Craig, Alaska earthquake 20 .

        <p>Alternatively, if the rupture changed direction following SE1, then this part of the earthquake must have travelled at super-shear ! ! (5-6 km/s). To validate this model, we used timedomain teleseismic back-projection (BP) imaging 27 with phase-weighted stacking of virtual seismic arrays (see Methods). We imaged the BP on two planar grids: one at 2.5 km depth and the other at 10 km depth below the seafloor. For the nucleation phase, we find a higher coherence of back-projected waves using the 10 km depth grid, consistent with rupture initiation in mantle. For the total rupture, the shallower grid has higher waveform coherence, indicating slip at crustal levels. The overall BP results (Supplementary Video S1) confirm an apparent reversal in rupture direction with an initial, eastwards propagation followed by a westerly-travelling phase travelling at 4-6 km/s (Figure 3b). Whilst the high-frequency radiators occur over a laterally more compact region than the sub-events and teleseismic sliprate model, the overall pattern is consistent.Alternatively, if the rupture changed direction following SE1, then this part of the earthquake must have travelled at super-shear ! !

        <p>We verify this result by searching for far-field Rayleigh Mach waves 28,29 by comparing waveforms filtered at 10-20 s period from the Romanche mainshock with a co-located Mw 5.6 earthquake on 2018-02-15 that had an identical faulting mechanism 30 (Figure 1; see Methods). At azimuths of 35-65° relative to rupture direction, many stations have very high waveform similarity between the mainshock and aftershock with cross-correlations exceeding 0.9 (Figure 1, Extended Data Figure 1). Accounting for phase velocity variations over large epicentral distances of up to 90° (Figure S14), these azimuths demarcate a Mach cone with lower rupture directivity effects 28,29 , similar to that predicted for a ! ! of 5.7 km/s Paper accepted for publication in Nature Geoscience on 26 June 2020 (see Methods; Extended Data Figure 2). Outside of the predicted Mach cone azimuths, waveform similarity is lower with cross-correlation coefficients generally less than 0.80 (Figure 3c; Extended Data Figure 1). A relatively low density of aftershocks in the super-shear segment (Figure 2a) is similar to past observations of super-shear earthquakes 31 . These indications of super-shear rupture appear to rule out the possibility of bilateral rupture from the hypocentre.We verify this result by searching for far-field Rayleigh Mach waves 28,29 by comparing waveforms filtered at 10-20 s period from the Romanche mainshock with a co-located Mw 5.6 earthquake on 2018-02-15 that had an identical faulting mechanism 30 (Figure 1; see Methods).

        <p>A remaining issue is whether after nucleation (∆% = 0-9 s) the rupture front was continuous, or SE1 was dynamically triggered due to S-waves from the initiation phase. The latter model, in which rupture nucleation may be regarded as a foreshock, is supported by the along-fault nodal maximum in S-wave amplitude and apparent ! ! ≈ 3.5-4 km/s, similar to the shearwave velocity (! " ) of mid-to-lower crust. Yet OBS waveforms show continuous seismic energy radiation over time following rupture nucleation (Figure S15), suggesting a spreading, continuous rupture as indicated by BP imaging, although we cannot completely rule out dynamic triggering at smaller scales 32 .A remaining issue is whether after nucleation (∆% = 0-9 s) the rupture front was continuous, or SE1 was dynamically triggered due to S-waves from the initiation phase.

        <p>The unique spatio-temporal evolution of the 2016 Romanche earthquake adds new understanding to the geological controls on seismic slip along mature strike-slip faults, providing direct evidence of super-shear rupture along OTFs. Theoretical studies have suggested that earthquakes on inhomogeneous faults rupture in a preferred direction for suband super-shear propagation 33 . The segment that failed in 2016 is likely bi-material since it offsets crust with an age difference of ~27 Ma (Figure 1). If we assume higher seismic velocities on the older and cooler north side, the preferred super-shear direction 33 is east, opposite to our observations. This finding indicates that propagation direction might not be Paper accepted for publication in Nature Geoscience on 26 June 2020 simply controlled by broad plate age and thermal variations. Instead, rupture direction may be more dependent on variable material properties within a wide (5-20 km) fault damage zone 12,13 . One possibility is that greater fracturing and serpentinisation may exist on the older side, possibly related to uplift of the transverse ridge to the north 34 , reducing seismic velocity, and resulting in preferred westward super-shear rupture.The unique spatio-temporal evolution of the 2016 Romanche earthquake adds new understanding to the geological controls on seismic slip along mature strike-slip faults, providing direct evidence of super-shear rupture along OTFs.

        <p>The depth and lateral extent of rupture is likely determined in part by variations of serpentinisation in the seismogenic zone. The OBS data, teleseismic slip rate inversion and BP imaging imply deeper initiation at ~20 km depth. Therefore, the earthquake nucleated in the oceanic mantle, at the base of the seismogenic zone 5,35 at 500-600°C temperature (Figure 4).The depth and lateral extent of rupture is likely determined in part by variations of serpentinisation in the seismogenic zone.

        <p>Nucleation was likely promoted by brittle failure in conditionally-stable serpentinised mantle peridotite 6 . Most seismic slip occurred in the crust beneath a topographically smoother segment of the Romanche axial valley (~6,200 m BSL; Figure 2a, Figure 4). At the rupture's western end, a deeper valley (&gt;6,500 m) may indicate greater hypothermal alteration and serpentinsation 11,13 , resulting in velocity-strengthening frictional behaviour 13,34 . The eastern edge of the rupture lies where the seafloor steepens to shallower depths of &lt;5,500 m at the diffuse RTI (Figure 2a, Figure 4), which likely restricted slip due to a narrower seismogenic zone 35 . These fault segments bounding the earthquake likely creep aseismically, contributing to the overall low seismic coupling of OTFs 5 . Our preferred explanation for rupture reversal during the 2016 Mw 7.1 Romanche earthquake is as follows and illustrated in Figure 4. Nucleation occurred at ~20 km depth, above the brittle-ductile transition (Figure 4, Step 1-2). SE1 then ruptured along the ~500-600°C isotherm towards the surface near the RTI, with relatively weak slip in conditionally-stable serpentinised mantle peridotite 35 (Figure 4, Step 3-4). We speculate that the SE2 fault Paper accepted for publication in Nature Geoscience on 26 June 2020 segment was pre-seismically more strongly coupled than for SE1, but its potential reactivation from a vertically propagating rupture front with little strain energy release was buffered by altered mantle peridotite. SE1 then provided sufficient strain energy release to overcome the larger fracture energy of the locked SE2 segment, resulting in super-shear rupture and termination in an adjacent weak zone (Figure 4, Step 5-6). Either both fault patches were sufficiently pre-seismically stressed to promote seismogenic failure 36 , or the deeper SE1 rupture instantaneously increased the static stress, immediately causing the shallow SE2 portion of the fault to fail.Nucleation was likely promoted by brittle failure in conditionally-stable serpentinised mantle peridotite 6 .

        <p>Alternatively, multiple fault strands in such a wide damage zone may also help to facilitate a reversing earthquake. Another possible explanation for the Romanche earthquake is that a cascading rupture reversal can occur when a weak nucleation phase starts in the mantle, and away from a barrier on one side of the fault. In this case, rupture directionality depends on interactions between the nucleation point, strain release history, and fracture energy variations along the fault. Whilst it has been suggested that seismogenic stresses on OTFs are highly deterministic [9][10][11] , our result implies that OTF earthquakes, even with long-lived asperity-barrier segmentation, may resemble those of continental strike-slip earthquakes, without requiring orthogonal fault systems.Alternatively, multiple fault strands in such a wide damage zone may also help to facilitate a reversing earthquake.

        <p>For hypocentre relocation, we used a 1-D layered P-wave velocity model for the central Atlantic from CRUST1.0 41 , and a constant vp/vs ratio of 1.71 (See Note S2). We used the 
            <rs type="software">NonLinLoc</rs> package 42 for hypocentre relocations in which we employed a travel-time dependent error, which effectively gives an epicentral distance weighting. We used true depths below sea level of the OBS stations in the relocation. The epicentre lies NW of the PI-LAB OBS network, with the closest station 130 km away. Our epicentre is located &lt;7 km away from those of other agencies that used teleseismic arrivals alone (Table S1), suggesting a robust estimation of the rupture nucleation position (Figure S2). Although the PI-LAB OBS network offers sub-optimal coverage of the rupture area, we are confident that the hypocentre locations are sufficiently accurate to probe the seismicity distribution along the fault (Note S3), although depths are poorly constrained. Next, we relocated 101 aftershocks and further refined these by performing a multiple-event relocation relative to the mainshock Paper accepted for publication in Nature Geoscience on 26 June 2020 hypocentre (Note S3). We also scanned continuous waveforms at the closest three stations to find any foreshocks in the days leading up to the mainshock, but we found none within this period along the Romanche Fracture Zone. Eleven of these aftershocks are in the USGS-NEIC catalogue. See Supplementary Data S1 for the full hypocentre and arrival time catalogue.

        <p>To investigate source complexity, we inverted waveforms at higher frequencies of 0.01 to 0.10 Hz. We used iterative deconvolution, which has been used extensively to probe rupture complexity at regional scales 3,44,45 . For each sub-event, we searched for length of the triangular source-time function that maximised VR. The centroid location of SE1 is better constrained than that of SE2 (Figure S4), which may reflect the long, fast rupture of SE2. We do not find any significant waveform pulse closer to the origin time, so we cannot robustly add a third sub-event, indicating comparatively less slip during the nucleation phase. This observation is in line with the 1994 Romanche earthquake 16 . In general, adding more than two subevents for this size of earthquake can be unstable does not improve the fit considerably 3 .To investigate source complexity, we inverted waveforms at higher frequencies of 0.01 to 0.10 Hz.

        <p>Vertical components of teleseismic P waveforms were obtained (see Data Availability; Supplementary Data S3) and we selected 57 stations (Figure S5) that cover all azimuths to capture radiation patterns, and also chose stations with high signal-to-noise ratio so we could reliably pick P-wave first motions. The instrument responses were removed and the records were converted into velocity waveforms, and then we resampled the data to one sample per second. GFs were calculated with the near-source velocity structures adopted from 
            <rs type="software">CRUST</rs>1.
            <rs type="version">0</rs> 41 . GFs were calculated with the near-source velocity structures adopted from 
            <rs type="software">CRUST</rs>1.0, and the attenuation time constant t* for the P wave was taken to be 1.0 s. We did not apply any filters to both the observed waveforms and the theoretical GFs following the inversion procedure 25 . We used the model plane striking at 79° and dipping at 77° based on the procedure for our regional CMT inversion and the relocated-aftershock distribution.

        <p>The model plane was discretised into a grid spanning 10 km and 5 km along the strike and dip directions, respectively. Our relocated hypocentre of the mainshock was adopted for the initial rupture point. Guided by the position and timing of the sub-events from RMT inversion, the Mach cone analysis, and the BP imaging results, we set the total rupture duration as 30 s and the maximum rupture speed at 6.0 km/s. Figure S3 shows the resulting teleseismic Pwave fits.The model plane was discretised into a grid spanning 10 km and 5 km along the strike and dip directions, respectively.

        <p>Semblance has sharper resolution than beampower for low-energy radiation and is less sensitive to amplitude effects due to site terms. The semblance from all virtual arrays is combined at each 3 s timestep for a total duration of 30 s (10 timesteps). To avoid an azimuthal bias, we subdivide all azimuthal directions around the epicentre into twelve sectors. The semblance from each azimuth sector is normalized to one, so that each azimuthal sector has the same influence on the combined semblance.Semblance has sharper resolution than beampower for low-energy radiation and is less sensitive to amplitude effects due to site terms.

        <p>Past theoretical and observational studies 28,29 have shown that the effect of rupture directivity on surface waves can be used to determine rupture velocity. For earthquakes rupturing at velocities slower than seismic wave speed, waves from the start and end of rupture arrive at a far-field receiver at variable times. However, for super-shear earthquakes, at stations located on the Mach cone, the waves from different parts of the rupture arrive at the same time. These simultaneous arrivals result in surface waves that are highly correlated with those of a smaller, co-located earthquake with identical faulting mechanism that can be viewed as a point-source at the periods considered.Past theoretical and observational studies 28,29 have shown that the effect of rupture directivity on surface waves can be used to determine rupture velocity.

        <p>Synthetic tests and experiments using different fault-plane geometries produced a similar pattern of slip to the optimum solution (Notes S5 and S6). The overall source-time function also compares well with that derived from OBS waveforms (Figure 2c). We assessed the robustness of the optimum teleseismic slip model by testing different fault geometries (up to ±10° in strike and dip). In all fault geometry configurations, the overall pattern of the slip distribution is very similar to that of the optimum model (Note S5). We also forward modelled waveforms from our optimum smooth solution, added Gaussian noise at a level of 1% of the signal variance, and inverted these waveforms. This synthetic test (Figure S12) shows that the inversion is able to retrieve the main features of the rupture in space and time.Synthetic tests and experiments using different fault-plane geometries produced a similar pattern of slip to the optimum solution (Notes S5 and S6).

This is followed by a larger pulse at ∆% = 20 s (SE2). Figure S5 shows the resulting teleseismic P-wave fits for our best-fitting model. The P-wave azimuthal variation of low-frequency teleseismic P-waves confirms that the larger slip patch (SE2) occurred west of the rupture nucleation (Figure S6).In raw teleseismic P-waves (Figure S5) small pulses following the initial P-wave are visible, with a broad pulse at ∆% = 10 s (SE1) particularly clear at WSW and ESE azimuths.
