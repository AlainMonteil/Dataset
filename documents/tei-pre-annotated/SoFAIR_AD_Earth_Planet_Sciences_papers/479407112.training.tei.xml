        <p>Paleoenvironmental reconstructions on a (supra-)regional scale have gained attention in Quaternary sciences during the last decades. In terrestrial realms, loess deposits and especially intercalations of loess and buried soils, so called loess-paleosol sequences (LPS) are important archives in order to unravel the terrestrial response to e.g. climatic fluctuations and reconstruct paleoenvironments during the Pleistocene. The analysis of LPS requires the knowledge of several key factors, such as the distribution of the aeolian sediments, their location relative to (potential) source areas, the climate conditions that led to their emplacement and the topography of the sink area. These factors strongly influence the sedimentological and paleoenvironmental characteristics of LPS and show broad variations throughout Europe, leading to a distinct distribution pattern throughout the continent. In our study, we present a new map of the distribution of aeolian sediments (mainly loess) and major potential source areas for Europe. The map was compiled combining geodata of different mapping approaches. Most of the used geodata stems from national maps of 27 different countries, which are highly accurate.

The result is a seamless map, which comprises pedological, geological, and geomorphological data and can be used for paleoenvironmental and archeological studies and other applications. We use the map and geomorphological cross-sections to discuss the various influences of geomorphology and paleoenvironment on the deposition and preservation of loess throughout Europe. We divided the loess areas into 6 main loess domains and 17 subdomains, in order to understand and explain the factors controlling their distribution. For the subdivision we used the following criteria: (1) influence of silt production areas, (2) affiliation to subcatchments, as rivers are very important regional silt transport agents, (3) occurrence of past periglacial activity with characteristic overprinting of the deposits. Additionally, the sediment distribution is combined with elevation data, to investigate the loess distribution statistically as well as visually. Throughout Europe, the variations and differences of the loess domains are the results of a complex interplay of changing paleoenvironmental conditions and related geomorphologic processes, controlling dust sources, transport, accumulation, preservation, pedogenesis, and simultaneous erosional and reworking events. Climatic, paleoclimatic, and pedoclimatic gradients are on the continental scale an additional important factor, since there are e.g. latitudinal differences of permafrost and periglacial processes, an increase in continentality from west to east and in aridity from northwest to southeast and south, strongly affecting sedimentary and geomorphic dynamics. We propose three main depositional regimes for loess formation in Europe: (1.) periglacial and tundra loess formation with periglacial processes and permafrost in the high latitude and mountainous regions; (2.) steppe and desert margin loess formation in the (semi-)arid regions; and (3.) loess and soil formation in temperate and subtropical regions. Loess deposits of (1.) and (2.) show coarser, sandier particle distributions toward the glacial and desert regions. In the humid areas (3.), forest vegetation limited dust production and accumulation, therefore, there is an increase in finer grain sizes due to the increase in weathering.

        <p>Loess is one of the most extensively distributed Pleistocene sedimentary deposits in the northern 80 hemisphere and Europe, representing the main archive of glacial periods (Bertran et al., 2016;Haase 81 et al., 2007;Marković et al., 2015;Rousseau et al., 2013). The so-called loess-paleosol sequences 82 (LPS) composed of the alternation of loess and buried soil (paleosol) horizons developed in response 83 to climatic changes, and are key-archives in order to unravel paleoclimate (eg. Gallet et al., 1996;84 Obreht et al., 2017;Torre et al., 2020), paleoenvironments (eg. Hatté et al., 2013;Liu and Liu, 2017;85 Schaetzl et al., 2018;Schatz et al., 2011), and paleolandscapes (eg. Hughes et al., 2010;Lehmkuhl et 86 al., 2016;Leonova et al., 2015). The fertile topsoils of loess landscapes have been heavily employed 87 in agricultural practices with highly specialized past to present agricultural use of the loess lowlands 88 already during the Neolithic, 7000 years ago (Bellwood, 2005;Whittle and Whittle, 1996). The Late 89Loess is one of the most extensively distributed Pleistocene sedimentary deposits in the northern 80 hemisphere and Europe, representing the main archive of glacial periods (Bertran et al., 2016;Haase 81 et al., 2007;Marković et al., 2015;Rousseau et al., 2013).

        <p>Pleistocene loess steppe and loess tundra also play an important role in understanding early modern 90 human migration and the occupation of Europe (Chu, 2018;Haesaerts et al., 2004;Hauck et al., 2017;91 Neugebauer-Maresch et al., 2014;Obreht et al., 2017;Zeuner, 1956). Stratigraphic and 92 pedostratigraphic records across European LPS exhibit a more or less constant pattern including 93 marker horizons (especially paleosols and paleosols complexes) that can be followed over long 94 distances (Antoine et al., 2019(Antoine et al., , 2016;;Haesaerts et al., 2004). This pattern demonstrates that LPS are 95 formed in response to at least supra-regional climatic forcing at various time-scales from glacial-96 interglacial (Bronger, 2003;Kukla, 1977) to millennial-scale cycles (e.g. Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, 97 Antoine et al., 2009a;Moine et al., 2017;Rousseau et al., 2011Rousseau et al., , 2007;;Zeeden et al., 2018). To 98 understand the environments under which loess deposits form, it is crucial to know their occurrence 99 and distribution, the geomorphological setting they formed in, and the climate conditions present 100 during their formation (e.g. Pécsi and Richter, 1996;Smalley and Leach, 1978). To comprehend and 101 analyze these environments, maps of the distribution of Quaternary aeolian sediments in western 102 Eurasia mid-latitudes show not only their abundance, but also their distance to potential source 103 areas and their relationship to elevation and relief (Lehmkuhl et al., 2018a(Lehmkuhl et al., , 2018b;;Lindner et al., 104 2017). As early as the first half of the 20 th century, the climatic importance of Scandinavian and 105 Alpine ice sheets for the zonal evolution of loess deposits in Europe was understood and implications 106 for a zonal distribution of loess facies were proposed (e.g. Zeuner, 1937). Generally, the distribution 107 of loess and especially the development of LPS in Europe were controlled by relief, climate, the 108 distance to large river systems, past continental ice sheets and the exposed shelf area of the North 109 Sea may have been a key factor (Antoine et al., 2016;Lehmkuhl et al., 2016). 110 annual precipitation on the lower panel.

        <p>While gathering and processing continent-wide geodata for an updated, seamless map of aeolian 129 sediments in Europe, we already compiled three regional-scale maps. The loess map of Hungary and 130 western Romania is based on geological and pedological data (Lindner et al., 2017). The subsequent 131 map of the entire Carpathian Basin, combines geodata sources from ten different countries 132 (Lehmkuhl et al., 2018a). Several cross-border problems arose due to different terminologies and 133 definitions of loess and related sediments, which are a consequence of the complex genesis of loess 134 sediments and the fundamental lack of representative genetic formation models (Lehmkuhl et al., 135 2018a;Smalley et al., 2011;Sprafke and Obreht, 2016). Such difficulties are not only restricted to 136 national borders, but are sometimes even present within one country, as shown in the map of loess 137 and other Quaternary sediments in Germany (Lehmkuhl et al., 2018b). Due to the federal system in 138 Germany, artificial breaks between different states could only be avoided by combining loess and 139 loess derivates in one mapping unit (Lehmkuhl et al., 2018b). 140While gathering and processing continent-wide geodata for an updated, seamless map of aeolian 129 sediments in Europe, we already compiled three regional-scale maps.

We visualize our analysis using cross-151 sections and 3-D images. To put the loess map into context and give an overview of the present day 152 environmental setting, Figure 1 depicts the modern climatic conditions of the European loess 153 covered regions (after Karger et al., 2017). 154 We demonstrate and discuss the influence of topography, the distance to ice margins and potential 155 source areas, as well as paleoclimatic patterns, such as the distribution of permafrost, on the 156 distribution and depositional facies of loess deposits in Europe.

        <p>The loess sediments in the United Kingdom are based on a national loess map (Catt, 1985). The 209 source map differentiates between variations in loess thickness. For the European map, only loess 210 with a thickness greater than 1 meter from Catt (1985) was used to keep the different data sets 211 comparable. The alluvial fill and fluvial deposits are based upon superficial deposits in the BGS 212 Geology 625k map (scale 1:625,000), with the permission of the British Geological Survey (2013). For 213 Belgium, the national soil map (scale 1:500,000) was used to map both aeolian sediments and 214 potential sediment sources (Marechal and Tavernier, 1970). The distribution of aeolian sediments 215 and sediment sources in the Netherlands is based on the geological map (scale 1:600,000; Zagwijn 216 and Van Staalduinen, 1975). It distinguished between loess, dunes and cover sands. For France, a 217 map of loess and other aeolian sediments (Antoine et al., 1999a; scale 1:1,000,000) based on various 218 geological and geomorphological maps, initially compiled in the 1970' for the first INQUA loess map 219 of Europe (Fink et al., 1977), was digitized. For Switzerland, the national general geological map 220 (Christ, 1944(Christ, , 1942;;Christ and Nabholz, 1950) was used as the most recent terminologically 221 consistent country-wide representation of loess (scale 1:200,000). In this case, georeferenced raster 222 files were available from which a map unit representing loess and loess derivates was vectorized. The 223 geodata for Spain contains information about the spatial distribution of loess, aeolian sand and 224 alluvial plains for central and northeastern Spain (Wolf et al., 2019) and is based on the geological 225 maps (scale 1:50,000; de San José Mancha, 1973) and the work by Balasch et al. (2019). 226 For Italy, the loess distribution -considered as 'loess derivates' for the European loess map -is 227 based on data collected by many scholars and summarized in Cremaschi (2004Cremaschi ( , 1990aCremaschi ( , 1987) ) and 228 data collected to draw an updated loess map (Zerboni et al., 2018). Moreover, the litho-229 paleoenvironmental maps of Italy prepared by the CLIMEX Group (Antonioli and Vai, 2004) and the 230 national soil map (Costantini et al., 2012) have been considered.

        <p>For Romania, the national geological maps (Ovejanu et al., 1968, scale 1:200,000;Săndulescu et al., 238 1978, scale 1:1,000,000) albeit distinguish several loess chronostratigraphic units, do not always 239 show a very good lateral representation of loess. Therefore, the approach by Lindner et al. (2017), 240 that investigated western Romania, was extended to the whole country. The main source map 241 analyzed is the soil map of Romania (Florea et al., 1971, scale 1 : 500,000), with which different soils 242 and soil textures were translated into different corresponding loess probability classes. For example, 243 dark Chernozems were assigned a loess probability class 3, while podzolic soils were assigned a loess 244 probability class 0. These loess probability classes were then combined to achieve a homogenous 245 classification of loess along the border region between Romania and Bulgaria. For Bulgaria, the 246 geological map of Bulgaria (Cheshitev et al., 1989, scale 1:500,000) was digitized. 247 National soil maps were digitized for Poland (Dobrzański et al., 1974), Moldova (Krupenikov et al., 248 1969) and Ukraine (Sokolovsky et al., 1977a). The maps for Poland and Ukraine specifically stated 249 which soils occur on loess or loess-like sediments. The Moldavian soil map provided a class solely for 250 the substratum on which the different soils were formed. In this case, the two classes loess loam and 251 eluvial-diluvial light clays and loams were reclassified as loess and loess derivates, respectively. For 252 the loess distributions for Belarus and western Russia, the European loess map by Haase et al. (2007) 253 was modified to fit the improved accuracy and scale. For this purpose, the map was compared to the 254 ALOS digital elevation model (JAXA EORC, 2016). The loess distribution was aligned to the Pleistocene 255 terraces and other geomorphological features determined via the elevation data. Afterwards, these 256 terraces were vectorized as alluvial fill and fluvial deposits. 257For Romania, the national geological maps (Ovejanu et al., 1968, scale 1:200,000;Săndulescu et al., 238 1978, scale 1:1,000,000) albeit distinguish several loess chronostratigraphic units, do not always 239 show a very good lateral representation of loess.

        <p>In addition to the national data sets, pan-European data sets for potential aeolian Pleistocene 258 sediment sources were evaluated and added to the map to substitute missing and deficient national 259 datasets and add complementary map units. This includes inter alia Late Pleistocene and Holocene 260 fluvial deposits, derived from the EUSR5000 soil map with a scale of 1:5,000,000 (BGR [Bundesanstalt 261 für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe], 2005). This data set was primarily used to substitute the 262 missing national data sets of fluvial deposits for the Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Belarus, and 263 Russia. In some places, it was compared to the digital elevation model and modified to fit the Late 264 Pleistocene terraces. In addition to alluvial fill and fluvial deposits, the modified Late Pleistocene dry 265 continental shelf (Willmes, 2015) that represents the main source for aeolian sediments was added 266 to the map. In order to pinpoint the main sediment sources and paths on the dry continental shelf, 267 paleochannels on the shelves such as e.g. the Channel River were extracted using the European 268 bathymetry data set EMODnet (2019). For an evaluation of the channel widths, estimates about 269 discharge were made in comparison to recent rivers and paleoriver channels on the recent landmass. 270In addition to the national data sets, pan-European data sets for potential aeolian Pleistocene 258 sediment sources were evaluated and added to the map to substitute missing and deficient national 259 datasets and add complementary map units.

        <p>The result of this approach is a seamless map of Late Pleistocene aeolian sediments and potential 287 sediment sources in Europe (Figure 2). Since it is mostly based on national and regional maps and 288 data sets, the final resolution and accuracy is very high for a pan-European approach and a scale of 289 approximately 1 : 1,000,000. A detailed table of the sources and a statistical analysis for each 290 mapped country can be found in the supplementary material (Supplement Tab.

Visualization: Cross sections and 3-D images 297 In order to outline the influence of the topography on the distribution of Late Pleistocene aeolian 298 sediments, four north-south running cross sections were derived using the new map and the ALOS 299 digital elevation model (JAXA EORC, 2016). To do so, polylines were interpolated based on the 300 elevation data. The interpolated lines were superelevated by the factor 100 and intersected with the 301 sediment distribution, glacial extents as well as the boundaries of (dis-) continuous permafrost and 302 the northern timberline. Moreover, six block diagrams (3-D images) were created using

        <p>We divided the European loess distribution in six major domains and 17 subdomains (Figure 3). For 356 the differentiation we used the following criteria that determine the loess facies: (1) Influence of 357 potential silt production areas (North European / Alpine ice sheets with glacial grinding and 358 periglacial areas with frost weathering vs. drylands with soluble salts and prevailing insolation 359 weathering). ( 2) Catchment areas, as rivers are very important regional silt transport agents and river 360 valleys act both as sinks and sources of sedimentary particles.

There are large variations between loess deposited 371 proximally to ice margins or more distally. Loess formation and preservation are among others 372 factors strongly influenced by the environment. In western Europe, for example, sediment layers 373 occur which show characteristics of laminated niveo-aeolian deposits (e.g. Antoine et al., 2016Antoine et al., , 2001;;374 Haesaerts et al., 2016), while in southeastern Europe, loess formation was rather homogeneous and 375 more continuous sedimentation took place (Marković et al., 2015;Obreht et al., 2019;Zeeden et al., 376 2016). Different potential major sources of aeolian deposits are the outwash plains of the British and 377We divided the European loess distribution in six major domains and 17 subdomains (Figure 3). For 356 the differentiation we used the following criteria that determine the loess facies: (1) Influence of 357 potential silt production areas (North European / Alpine ice sheets with glacial grinding and 358 periglacial areas with frost weathering vs. drylands with soluble salts and prevailing insolation 359 weathering).

In southern Germany for example, we distinguish between 379 loess linked to sources from the Swiss Alps (Upper Rhine Plain or Graben, subdomain IIIb) and from 380 the Black Forest and the Eastern Alps (Upper Danube, subdomain IIIc). The most important (paleo-) 381 environmental factors dividing the subdomains are (1) the boundaries of the (dis-) continuous 382 permafrost, which strongly influences the preservation of loess, and (2) hydroclimatic factors, 383 especially continentality which generally increases from west to east and strongly changes the 384 chemical weathering and pedogenesis intensity.

A recent 423 review concerning loess in England is given in Assadi-Longroudi (2019). 424 Sandy deposits form a belt spanning from Belgium, through the Netherlands, Germany, Poland up to 425 northwestern Ukraine. Kozarski and Nowaczyk (1991) reported a relatively frequent occurrence of 426 isolated loess and sandy loess patches in lower Oder (Odra) and Warta region (northwestern Poland). 427 Within this belt, the aeolian sediments reach various thicknesses, up to several meters. However, 428 quite many of these regional sand sheets have thicknesses less than 2 m. As our data is mainly based 429 on geological maps, sediments with a thickness of less than 2 m are not all included in our map. The 430 grain size decreases with increasing distance from the Weichselian ice sheets: aeolian sand and sandy 431 loess can be found in proximity to the source areas (e.g. in Germany east of Hamburg and south of 432 Berlin, respectively), whereas loess and loess derivates can be found in distal positions further south 433 (domain II). There are also aeolian sand covers that are overlapping with the maximum extent of the 434 Weichselian glaciation. This indicates a post-LGM sedimentation during the late glacial or even early 435 Holocene (Hilgers et al., 2001b;Koster, 2005;Küster and Preusser, 2010;Zeeberg, 1998). 436 Vandenberghe (in Schaetzl et al., 2018) gives a summary of these periglacial aeolian sands and their 437 transition to loess. Most of the loess deposits in this subdomain can be found at elevations between 438 27 m and 101 m, with its maximum at 229 m (cf.

        <p>Ib: Eastern protogenetic subdomain 440 Subdomain Ib comprises the loess deposits on the plains of Belarus and Russia. Loess is found in 441 elevations up to 285 m a.s.l. The southern border of this domain is the border between continuous 442 and discontinuous loess mantle as suggested by Velichko (1990) along the line from Lviv through Kyiv 443 to Ryazan. Towards the north from this line up to the limits of Valdai (Weichselian) ice sheet, loess 444 occurs rather sporadically (subdomain Ib) with the largest patches found in the vicinity of the cities of 445 Minsk, Smolensk, Moscow and Vladimir. South of this line the loess forms an almost continuous 446 mantle (domains II and V) stretching up to the coasts of Black and Azov Seas (cf. Gozhik et al., 2014). 447 Discontinuous loess of subdomain Ib was deposited mainly during the Late Pleistocene (Velichko et 448 al., 2006). The key loess sections in this area contain pedogenic marker horizons in the form of two 449 well developed paleosol complexes assigned to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 and MIS 3, respectively, 450 and are stratigraphically comparable to other marker paleosol complexes in European loess areas 451 (Little et al., 2002;Rutter et al., 2003;Velichko, 1990). However, the particular feature of loess 452 sequences in this subdomain are stratigraphically consistent and frequently repeating periglacial 453 features indicating the impact of permafrost conditions and changing hydroclimate of the last glacial 454 period (Morozova and Nechaev, 1997;Velichko et al., 2006).

We divided this domain into five subdomains: three (IIa-c) from west to east along the front 468 of the Central European low mountain ranges stretching to western Ukraine and gradually passing on 469 towards subdomain IId in northern Ukraine and Russian uplands.

        <p>The northern boundary of the domain II with continuous loess distribution probably coincides with 477 the northern fringe of past vegetation (biome) zones, as the vegetation influenced and enhanced the 478 dust deposition.

        <p>This domain mainly contains loess that was deposited during the last glacial cycle. During this period, 486 environmental conditions were highly variable and included erosive processes (slope wash and 487 deflation, desert pavements) and periglacial processes (solifluction, involution, permafrost;488 Vandenberghe et al., 2014a;Zens et al., 2018). For example the Middle Pleniglacial (MPG) loess is 489 rarely preserved due to several large erosion phases in contrary to the most recent loess (Upper 490 Pleniglacial, UPG), that still occurs over a large area and exhibits the highest loess accumulation rates 491 of the entire last glacial cycle (e.g. Frechen et al., 2003;Zens et al., 2018). Supra-regional attribution 492 to past environmental conditions remains difficult (Kadereit et al., 2013;Sauer et al., 2016). 493 However, long LPS sequences with a total thickness of more than 10 m, even including the whole 494 Middle Pleniglacial (MPG) are locally preserved as cover deposits overlying high or middle fluvial 495 terraces as in the Seine and Somme rivers (Grâce-Autoroute: Antoine et al., 2003;Saint-Pierre-lès-496 Elbeuf: Coutard et al., 2018;Lautridou, 1987) or in dissolution sinkholes in the chalk bedrock 497 (Coutard et al., 2018). In addition, recent improvement in dating allowed for evidencing a detailed 498 succession of interstadial soil horizons for MPG or ~MIS3 in sections from the Rhine area, such as 499 Nussloch (cf.

        <p>For the whole area from Northern Brittany to Belgium the general stratigraphy of the last glacial 539 period (115-11.7 ka) can be summarised as follows (Antoine et al., 2016(Antoine et al., , 2001;;Zens et al., 2018): The 540 Weichselian sequence starts above the truncated last interglacial brown leached soil complex 541 (Rocourt / Elbeuf I) and can be further subdivided by four main chronoclimatic phases: (1) Early 542 glacial (115-72 ka) consisting of a phase with grey forest soils (early glacial A) and a phase with 543 steppe-like soils (early glacial B); (2) Lower Pleniglacial (LPG, 70-58 ka): first typical homogeneous 544 loess deposits marking the first occurrence of typical periglacial conditions; (3) Middle Pleniglacial 545 (MPG, 58-32): Loess deposition was strongly diminished and frequent phases of erosion reduced 546 the resolution of MPG sediments in most LPS (Antoine et al., 2001). As a result of the relocation, the 547 older units are redeposited in colluviums. A brown soil complex and very weak aeolian deposits have 548 been preserved only in positions which are less affected by erosion; (4) Upper Pleniglacial (UPG, 32-549 15 ka): characterised by a drastic increase in loess sedimentation and the formation of tundra-gley 550 horizons and large ice wedge casts occur, especially between 30 and 23 ka (Antoine et al., 2016;Zens 551 et al., 2018). 552 553 Figure 6: Loess stratigraphy in northern France (subdomain IIa) controlled by asymmetric valley 554 topography (modified according to Antoine et al., 2016). 555For the whole area from Northern Brittany to Belgium the general stratigraphy of the last glacial 539 period (115-11.7 ka) can be summarised as follows (Antoine et al., 2016(Antoine et al., , 2001;;Zens et al., 2018): The 540 Weichselian sequence starts above the truncated last interglacial brown leached soil complex 541 (Rocourt / Elbeuf I) and can be further subdivided by four main chronoclimatic phases: (1) Early 542 glacial (115-72 ka) consisting of a phase with grey forest soils (early glacial A) and a phase with 543 steppe-like soils (early glacial B); (2) Lower Pleniglacial (LPG, 70-58 ka): first typical homogeneous 544 loess deposits marking the first occurrence of typical periglacial conditions; (3) Middle Pleniglacial 545 (MPG, 58-32): Loess deposition was strongly diminished and frequent phases of erosion reduced 546 the resolution of MPG sediments in most LPS (Antoine et al., 2001).

        <p>The Belgian and Dutch parts of Limburg are partly covered by loess (van Baelen, 2017;Zagwijn and 556 Van Staalduinen, 1975) and the deposits have a continuous thickness of 2 to 6 m (Antoine et al., 557 2003(Antoine et al., 557 , 1999a;;Henze, 1998;Kels, 2007;Meijs, 2002). Both, Weichselian and Saalian loess deposits 558 have been preserved (Kolfschoten et al., 1993;Meijs et al., 2013;van Baelen, 2017;Vancampenhout 559 et al., 2013). The LPS Romont (cf.

        <p>The Lower Rhine Embayment shows clear differences in the presence and properties of loess related 564 to the (meso-) relief. Loess sections in plateau-like positions are usually shorter and more affected by 565 erosion than sections in depressions, paleochannels, on stretched slopes and slope toes. The latter 566 ones are characterized by reworked sediments of older paleosols redeposited as heterogeneous, 567 finely laminated colluvium (Lehmkuhl et al., 2016;Schirmer, 2016 and references therein). After the 568 Eemian interglacial, Chernozem-like humic soils were formed under steppe-like environmental 569 conditions. This was followed by a transition to colder and more continental conditions, which are 570 reflected in the respective loess stratigraphies (eg. Haesaerts et al., 2016;Schirmer, 2016;Semmel, 571 1998). The first phases of the last glacial cycle are characterized by redeposited finely laminated 572 sediments while the loess packages contain several thin and weakly developed tundra gleys and 573 humic soils (cf. Figure 5; Zens et al., 2018). The most recent loess layer in this subdomain can be 574 divided into two sedimentary facies: the niveo-aeolian (cold-humid) and the homogenous loess (cold-575 arid). They were termed Hesbaye and Brabant loess in Belgium and the Lower Rhine Embayment 576 (e.g. Haesaerts et al., 2016;Schirmer, 2016) and can be also observed in northern France (Antoine et 577 al., 2016). 578 In the western parts, e.g. in the foreland of the Harz Mountains, a more undulating relief developed 594 on bedrock is covered with a generally thin loess cover. This is due to the advances and fluctuations 595 of the ice sheets during the Saalian glacial period into this region and thus resulting in the absence of 596 older LPS. Lehmkuhl et al. (2016) summarized the differences and similarities of LPS in the transition 597 from more humid areas in the Lower Rhine Embayment towards drier areas in the east. In the 598 foreland of the Harz Mountains, more continental climate condition lead to less intensive periglacial 599 slope processes and solifluction, which is expressed by more complete preservation and less 600 pronounced erosion and erosional discordances (Lehmkuhl et al., 2016). Figure 8 shows a 3-D 601 visualization of the loess distribution surrounding the Harz Mountains including the two selected 602 sections of Hecklingen and Zilly. Recent papers provide a summary for selected sections in the 603 northern foreland of the Harz Mountains (Krauß et al., 2016;Lehmkuhl et al., 2016). A stratigraphy is 604 depicted in Figure 5. The northern margin of the loess in this subdomain is in some areas a sharp, rectilinear boundary. 610The Lower Rhine Embayment shows clear differences in the presence and properties of loess related 564 to the (meso-) relief.

The northern margin of the loess in this subdomain is in some areas a sharp, rectilinear boundary. 610</p>
        <p>Sections at this loess boundary show a distinct succession of loess, sandy loess and loess with sand 611 layers, which were later modified by aeolian and cryogenic processes (Gehrt, 1994;Gehrt and 612 Hagedorn, 1996).

        <p>Luminescence dating from sections of the loess-edge ramp leads to the assumption that the latest, 616 northernmost loess formation occurred until the late glacial period. The time span covered by 617 luminescence ages sedimentation starts at ~28 ka and lasts with the sandier sediments from about 618 15 until 8 ka with the averages concentrated at ~11 ka. These findings confirm earlier suggestions 619 that the northernmost loess deposits in northern Germany represent the return of strong aeolian 620 processes (westerly winds) under the cold and dry conditions during the late glacial shaping this 621 northern loess boundary (Hilgers et al., 2001a). 622Luminescence dating from sections of the loess-edge ramp leads to the assumption that the latest, 616 northernmost loess formation occurred until the late glacial period.

        <p>In Saxony, the thickness of the loess deposits increases from south to north and reaches a maximum 623 of around 8-12 m close to the northern boundary. Northwards, there is an abrupt change from loess 624 deposits to coarser-grained aeolian, glacial or glaciofluvial sediments (Haase et al., 1970;Meszner et 625 al., 2014Meszner et 625 al., , 2013)). The so-called loess-edge ramp, comparable, but still distinct to those in Lower 626 Saxony, marks in parts of Saxony this clear northern border.

        <p>Loess in southwestern Poland is distributed in several isolated patches differing in sediment 635 thickness, stratigraphy and basic physical properties (Jary, 2010(Jary, , 1996;;Jary et al., 2016Jary et al., , 2002)). Its 636 aeolian origin was recognized early by Orth (1872). Thin, discontinuous patches of loess and loess-637 derived sediments prevails but there are also thick loess covers (up to 10-15 m) with well-defined 638 stratigraphy of the last glacial period (Jary, 2007;Moska et al., 2019Moska et al., , 2012Moska et al., , 2011)). Aeolian silt was 639 derived and deposited within a relatively narrow corridor between the Weichselian Ice Sheet and 640 Sudetes Mountains. The loess material was presumably redistributed by the Great Odra Valley fluvial 641 system (Badura et al., 2013) and then blown to the adjacent elevations by strong winds from the NW. 642Loess in southwestern Poland is distributed in several isolated patches differing in sediment 635 thickness, stratigraphy and basic physical properties (Jary, 2010(Jary, , 1996;;Jary et al., 2016Jary et al., , 2002)).

There is a gradual shift from subdomain IIb to more continental conditions of 651 subdomain IIc. This also affected the periglacial processes with more frequent cryoturbation horizons 652 and larger ice wedge casts in the east (Jary, 2009;Jary and Ciszek, 2013). Compared to subdomain IIb 653 this area has a greater distance to the Weichselian ice sheet and due to the absence of Saalian ice in 654 most parts also pre-Weichselian loess deposits occur.

        <p>In Poland, Maruszczak (1991Maruszczak ( , 1985) ) distinguishes three regions of loess occurrence within the 669 southern Polish upland region (in the vicinity of Kraków, Sandomierz and Lublin) and two foothill 670 regions in the foreground of the Sudetes (subdomain IIb) and the Carpathians (subdomain IIc). A 671 typical feature of the Polish loess areas is their occurrence as isolated patches and its transitional 672 position between subdomains IIb (SW Poland) and IIc (SE Poland). Many authors claimed that the 673 loess covers in Poland reflect present and past regional climatic conditions: continental in the east 674 and more oceanic in the west (Cegła, 1972;Jersak, 1973;Maruszczak, 1991). The thickness, 675 continuity and stratigraphic differentiation of loess cover increase towards the east (Jary, 2009;Jary 676 and Ciszek, 2013). These isolated loess patches are composed of units of different ages; Late 677 Pleistocene loess, however, predominates in the area of loess occurrence. In eastern Poland, loess of 678 several glacial cycles formed thick sequences, locally up to 40 m thickness. A fundamental rule of 679 loess arrangement in Poland is the connection of this deposit with a specified hypsometric level of 680 180-300 m a.s.l.. Locally, the lower limit drops to 150 m whereas the upper limit of loess occurrence 681 may exceed 400 m a.s.l. (Jersak, 1973;Maruszczak, 1991Maruszczak, , 1985Maruszczak, , 1969)). The thick loess mantles are 682 often limited by distinct morphologic margins controlled by primary accumulation. The main dust 683 sources for loess formation in Poland are usually related to the Pleistocene Fennoscandian ice sheets 684 (e.g. Jahn, 1950;Jary and Kida, 2000;Smalley and Leach, 1978;Tutkovsky, 1899). However, some 685 authors stress the role of local sources (e.g. Malicki, 1950;Maruszczak, 1991) and/or the significance 686 of fluvial processes delivering material for aeolian deposits through the Vistula River and its 687 tributaries (e.g. Jersak, 1973;Maruszczak, 1991). Most of the loess in this subdomain is found at 688 elevations between 218and 292 m a.s.l., with a minimum and maximum at 169 m and 438 m a.s.l., 689 respectively (cf. Chapter 3.3). 690In Poland, Maruszczak (1991Maruszczak ( , 1985) ) distinguishes three regions of loess occurrence within the 669 southern Polish upland region (in the vicinity of Kraków, Sandomierz and Lublin) and two foothill 670 regions in the foreground of the Sudetes (subdomain IIb) and the Carpathians (subdomain IIc).

        <p>Important source areas of this loess subdomain and also for domain V were the alluvial and 700 lacustrine plains that formed in front of the advancing and retreating Pleistocene ice sheets (Buggle 701 et al., 2008;Makeev, 2009;Velichko, 1990;Velichko et al., 2006). The outwash material was 702 transported by north-south flowing rivers (e.g. Dneiper, Dniester, Volga) or by frequent northerly 703 winds. The loess cover in this subdomain is very thick (usually 10-20 m , Haase et al., 2007;Li et al., 704 2020 report local occurrences up to 50 m). In this area, dust accumulated in more tundra-like 705 environments. In some regions there are older glacial tills from the maximum extent of the Elsterian 706 (Oka) and Saalian (Dnieper) glaciations even intercalated into the loess deposits.

        <p>The loess sections further to the east in Bohemia (western part of Czech Republic) have more 725 similarities with sections of the northern European loess belt (domain II) than those in the south 726 Moravia (the southeastern part of the Czech Republic (domain III)), as apparent e.g. from 727 geochemical and rock magnetic investigations conducting on the reference Late Pleistocene LPS 728 (Hošek et al., 2015). The data reveal stronger leaching of central Bohemian compared to south 729 Moravian loess and paleosols suggesting more humid conditions in the more northwesterly situated 730 Bohemia. Consequently, these findings suggest that the transitional zone between the two climate 731 regions, or the two different modes, of the Late Pleistocene climate in central Europe could be quite 732 narrow. Bohemia was and is under the direct influence of Atlantic cyclones whereas south Moravia 733 belongs geographically to the Pannonian Basin, which was marked in the Late Pleistocene by 734 continuous dry continental climate conditions, under the effects of a temperate sub-Mediterranean 735 climatic influence (Krolopp and Sümegi, 2002;Marković et al., 2007). In addition, the region benefits 736 from its rain shadow position in the southeast of the Bohemian Massif and its proximity to the 737 Carpathian Basin from where dry and warm air masses can penetrate. Therefore, we attribute the 738 Bohemian area to IIe and the Moravian loess to the subdomain IIId.

        <p>The complexity of the pedosedimentary and stratigraphical evolution of the last glacial cycle loess is 743 particularly high in subdomain IIa and decreases towards domain V, while the loess thickness 744 increases on average (Figure 5).

        <p>Marker features such as the Eltville tephra, or the Eben unconformity allow the inter-section 754 correlation of individual profiles, and also the correlation between subdomains and domains, 755 especially in-between domain II and III.

        <p>The preservation of the markers, especially the tephra layers, is often achieved by high aeolian 785 accumulation rates at the time of their deposition. Therefore, for example at Ringen five individual 786 bands of the Eltville tephra can be differentiated (Zens et al., 2017). In Susak, the loess is 787 interfingered with rapidly deposited laterally strongly varying aeolian sands as well as three tephra 788 layers (Wacha et al., 2011b). 789 this area are also influenced by periglacial processes. These areas are strongly impacted by the 799 mentioned major rivers, originating in the Alps (Rhône and Rhine), the Black Forest (the Danube 800 major tributaries, like Inn River, draining the central Alps), and the northeastern Carpathian 801 Mountains (Tisa, Somes, Mures), which are responsible for the silt transport from the Pleistocene 802 alpine glaciers. All these areas are still influenced by periglacial conditions during loess accumulation 803 and therefore the LPS of this domain are usually comparable with those from the northern European 804 loess belt (domain II). A west-east trend in increasing climate continentality, modulated by regional 805 topographic variations, can be recognized in the character of the intercalated interglacial and 806 interstadial paleosols.

Recent studies investigate the Pleistocene loess of 817 these areas, highlighting the Rhône River as the major dust source in the area. The (paleo-)wind 818 direction in the southern part, the Rhône graben, is north-south since air masses are channelled and 819 concentrated by the topography. The more Mediterranean influenced loess sequences of the 820 southern Rhône valley and the Provence seem to have their source area more in ophiolitic areas of 821 the Alp massif (Bosq et al., 2020a).

        <p>This subdomain comprises loess in the Upper Rhine Plain (Graben) and adjacent areas, such as the 826 Kraichgau and Neckar Basin to the east. Common features of this subdomain are (1) the Pleistocene 827 glaciations of the Alps and the higher mountains of Jura, Vosges and Black forest as proximal areas 828 for glacial silt production, (2) periglacial silt production and regional sediment transport of the Rhine 829 River and its tributaries until the northern end of the Upper Rhine plain and aeolian transport from 830 the wide Pleistocene braided river plain, and (3) features of periglacial overprinting of the LPS. 831 Switzerland was largely covered by ice during the last glaciations. Loess deposits of few meters in 832 thickness are present on high terraces and hills in the lowlands close to Aarau and along the Rhine 833 River (Christ, 1944(Christ, , 1942;;Christ and Nabholz, 1950;Gouda, 1962). In the Upper Rhine Plain, the 834 Rhine developed a large braided river system during the Pleistocene providing abundant material for 835 mineral dust deflation. In the marginal hills of the southern Upper Rhine Plain and at the Kaiserstuhl, 836 loess reaches in places thicknesses of more than 25 m (Guenther, 1987). Figure 10 indicates locations 837 of important LPS in the Rhine-Neckar region, including the European reference LPS Nussloch located 838 in a loess greda (dune-like morphology), characterized by an exceptional high last glacial dust 839 accumulation rate (see Figure 5, Antoine et al., 2009bAntoine et al., , 2001;;Moine et al., 2017 and references middle Upper Rhine Graben and the adjacent eastern shoulders with elevations between 300 and 842 600 m a.s.l. (e.g. the Kraichgau and Neckar Basin). Aeolian sands are located close to the Rhine, 843 indicating their local transport by westerly winds. Further east widespread loess covers indicate 844 large-scale silt transport from the dry riverbeds of the Rhine, with a clear Alpine contribution. 845 Antoine et al. (2009a) further assume significant deposition of dust from the English Channel and 846 northern France in the region close to Heidelberg. Upstream the Neckar and its tributaries we 847 assume next to the contribution from the glaciated Black Forest regional periglacial silt sources. Loess 848 formation in subdomain IIIb occurred mainly under the cold and dry periglacial condition in a cold 849 tundra environment (recent publications and references therein: Kadereit et al., 2013;Krauß et al., 850 2017;Zens et al., 2018). The lowlands in this region are slightly dryer compared to the neighboring 851 regions in the north and west, but there are also a lot of similarities to the northern European loess 852 belt including tundra gley soils (Gelic Cryosols) and some of the same marker soil horizons. 853 Swiss LPS are few and poorly studied. Most known is probably the c. 17 m thick Middle to Late 854 Pleistocene section formerly exposed in the brickyard of Allschwil near Basel (Zollinger, Gaby, 1991). 855 23 km upstream the Rhine, drillings revealed more than 6 m thick last glacial loess deposits, recently 856 studied by Gaar and Preusser (2017). Close to Freiburg, at Heitersheim and Riegel, 20 to 30 m of loess 857 contain one or more interglacial Bt horizons (Guenther, 1987). There are also thick loess sequences 858 on the western side of the Rhine River in France; the most prominent site is Achenheim, including 859 three interglacial paleosols along a more than 30 m thick LPS and which contains also Paleolithic 860 findings (see Rousseau and Puisségur, 1990 and references therein). The LPS of the Rhein-Neckar 861 region are shown in Figure 10 (see also Bibus, 2002). The 23 m thick LPS Nussloch is well known as 862 highly resolved Upper Pleniglacial loess record of central Europe (see Figure 5). At Mainz-Weisenau, 863 at the northern end of the Upper Rhine Plain, an over 6 m thick profile exposed the last interglacial 864 soil and three early glacial humus zones (Bibus et al., 2002). Most of the loess in this subdomain is 865 distributed in elevations between 186 m and 349 m a.s.l., with a minimum and maximum of 107 m 866 and 577 m a.s.l. (cf. Chapter 3.3). 867 868 subdomain IIIc is largely restricted to the thickest last glacial deposits and the lowest altitudes of this 882 region, whereas loess sediments in subdomain IIId usually have high carbonate contents (Fink, 1965). 883This subdomain comprises loess in the Upper Rhine Plain (Graben) and adjacent areas, such as the 826 Kraichgau and Neckar Basin to the east. Common features of this subdomain are (1) the Pleistocene 827 glaciations of the Alps and the higher mountains of Jura, Vosges and Black forest as proximal areas 828 for glacial silt production, (2) periglacial silt production and regional sediment transport of the Rhine 829 River and its tributaries until the northern end of the Upper Rhine plain and aeolian transport from 830 the wide Pleistocene braided river plain, and (3) features of periglacial overprinting of the LPS. 831 Switzerland was largely covered by ice during the last glaciations. Loess deposits of few meters in 832 thickness are present on high terraces and hills in the lowlands close to Aarau and along the Rhine 833 River (Christ, 1944(Christ, , 1942;;Christ and Nabholz, 1950;Gouda, 1962). In the Upper Rhine Plain, the 834 Rhine developed a large braided river system during the Pleistocene providing abundant material for 835 mineral dust deflation. In the marginal hills of the southern Upper Rhine Plain and at the Kaiserstuhl, 836 loess reaches in places thicknesses of more than 25 m (Guenther, 1987). Figure 10 indicates locations 837 of important LPS in the Rhine-Neckar region, including the European reference LPS Nussloch located 838 in a loess greda (dune-like morphology), characterized by an exceptional high last glacial dust 839 accumulation rate (see Figure 5, Antoine et al., 2009bAntoine et al., , 2001;;Moine et al., 2017 and references middle Upper Rhine Graben and the adjacent eastern shoulders with elevations between 300 and 842 600 m a.s.l. (e.g. the Kraichgau and Neckar Basin). Aeolian sands are located close to the Rhine, 843 indicating their local transport by westerly winds. Further east widespread loess covers indicate 844 large-scale silt transport from the dry riverbeds of the Rhine, with a clear Alpine contribution. 845 Antoine et al. (2009a) further assume significant deposition of dust from the English Channel and 846 northern France in the region close to Heidelberg. Upstream the Neckar and its tributaries we 847 assume next to the contribution from the glaciated Black Forest regional periglacial silt sources. Loess 848 formation in subdomain IIIb occurred mainly under the cold and dry periglacial condition in a cold 849 tundra environment (recent publications and references therein: Kadereit et al., 2013;Krauß et al., 850 2017;Zens et al., 2018). The lowlands in this region are slightly dryer compared to the neighboring 851 regions in the north and west, but there are also a lot of similarities to the northern European loess 852 belt including tundra gley soils (Gelic Cryosols) and some of the same marker soil horizons. 853 Swiss LPS are few and poorly studied. Most known is probably the c. 17 m thick Middle to Late 854 Pleistocene section formerly exposed in the brickyard of Allschwil near Basel (Zollinger, Gaby, 1991). 855 23 km upstream the Rhine, drillings revealed more than 6 m thick last glacial loess deposits, recently 856 studied by Gaar and Preusser (2017). Close to Freiburg, at Heitersheim and Riegel, 20 to 30 m of loess 857 contain one or more interglacial Bt horizons (Guenther, 1987). There are also thick loess sequences 858 on the western side of the Rhine River in France; the most prominent site is Achenheim, including 859 three interglacial paleosols along a more than 30 m thick LPS and which contains also Paleolithic 860 findings (see Rousseau and Puisségur, 1990 and references therein). The LPS of the Rhein-Neckar 861 region are shown in Figure 10 (see also Bibus, 2002). The 23 m thick LPS Nussloch is well known as 862 highly resolved Upper Pleniglacial loess record of central Europe (see Figure 5). At Mainz-Weisenau, 863 at the northern end of the Upper Rhine Plain, an over 6 m thick profile exposed the last interglacial 864 soil and three early glacial humus zones (Bibus et al., 2002). Most of the loess in this subdomain is 865 distributed in elevations between 186 m and 349 m a.s.l., with a minimum and maximum of 107 m 866 and 577 m a.s.l. (cf. Chapter 3.3). 867 868 subdomain IIIc is largely restricted to the thickest last glacial deposits and the lowest altitudes of this 882 region, whereas loess sediments in subdomain IIId usually have high carbonate contents (Fink, 1965). 883</p>
        <p>Closer to the Alps, with increasing moisture, the decalcified loess shows redoximorphic features, 884 which corresponds to the brown loess and dust loam facies, respectively (Fink and Nagl, 1979; 885 section 2.1. Most of the loess and loess derivates in subdomain IIIc are located at elevations between 886 378 and 488 m, with minimum and maximum values of 290 m and 638 m (see Chapter 3.3). 887Closer to the Alps, with increasing moisture, the decalcified loess shows redoximorphic features, 884 which corresponds to the brown loess and dust loam facies, respectively (Fink and Nagl, 1979; 885 section 2.1.

        <p>Upper terrace gravel pits expose up to 5-10 m thick last glacial LPS, for example Bobingen in 888 southwestern Bavaria (Mayr et al., 2017) or Gunderding in northeastern Austria (Terhorst et al., 889 2015). LPS of 10-15 m thickness reaching back into the Middle Pleistocene (with several Bt horizons) 890 could be found in loam pits, usually on older Terrace levels (Deckenschotter) and in the Neogene 891 Alpine molasse hills, e.g. at Hagelstadt in Central Bavaria (Strunk, 1990) or Wels-Aschet in NE Austria 892 (Terhorst, 2013). 893 In northeast Austria, loess sediments are widespread along the higher terraces of the Danube and 906 adjacent hills (Figure 11) locally reaching almost 40 m thickness at Krems, where the Danube leaves 907 the narrow valley cutting through the Bohemian Massif (Wachau). Within the Wachau and at the 908 eastern margin of the Bohemian Massif loess deposits are highly variable in age and thickness and 909 often contain fragments of local rock mixed in by slope processes (Sprafke, 2016;Sprafke and 910 Obreht, 2016). A high carbonate content (c. 20-25 %) and loess-like structure made Vetters (1933) 911 map these silt-dominated deposits as loess, whereas decalcified aeolian silts in northwestern and 912 southeastern Austria remain largely ignored on geological maps (see section 2). Thick loess deposits 913 in northwestern Austria and Moravia can be found in the lowlands of the larger tributaries of the 914 Danube (Morava/Thaya), but on the eastern side of these rivers on the border to the Slovakian 915 Republic, large areas of aeolian sand are formed, which indicates that the wind mainly deflated dry 916 floodplain deposits from western directions. Notable loess covers of variable thickness are present in 917 the rolling hills between the larger rivers, but the highest altitudes between Danube and Thaya 918 remain free of loess (Figure 11). 919 LPS close to the Bohemian Massif and in the hills of northeastern Austria are variable in age and 920 temporal resolution. Interglacial paleosols in the Krems-region are often polygenetic or missing 921 completely because of reworking or partially erosion, especially at ending phases of interglacials, 922 which renders pedostratigraphical approaches rather difficult (Sprafke, 2016). The classical LPS of 923 Krems-Schießstätte (shooting range) and Stranzendorf are unique loess records of the Early 924 Pleistocene paleoclimatic cycles (Fink and Kukla, 1977;Kukla and Cílek, 1996). The LPS Paudorf and 925Upper terrace gravel pits expose up to 5-10 m thick last glacial LPS, for example Bobingen in 888 southwestern Bavaria (Mayr et al., 2017) or Gunderding in northeastern Austria (Terhorst et al., 889 2015). LPS of 10-15 m thickness reaching back into the Middle Pleistocene (with several Bt horizons) 890 could be found in loam pits, usually on older Terrace levels (Deckenschotter) and in the Neogene 891 Alpine molasse hills, e.g. at Hagelstadt in Central Bavaria (Strunk, 1990) or Wels-Aschet in NE Austria 892 (Terhorst, 2013). 893 In northeast Austria, loess sediments are widespread along the higher terraces of the Danube and 906 adjacent hills (Figure 11) locally reaching almost 40 m thickness at Krems, where the Danube leaves 907 the narrow valley cutting through the Bohemian Massif (Wachau).

        <p>The loess deposits of the Carpathian Basin and adjacent areas are not as homogeneous as one might expect. In the western part of domain IV between southwestern Austria and Croatia the distinction between Neogene Pannonian Basin silts and loess is not always clear, which is complicated by redoximorphic features overprinting these sediments, i.e. dust loam according to Fink &amp; Nagl (1979) and pseudogleyed loess derivates after Rubinić et al. (2018). Yet, these poorly mapped and investigated loess deposits can reach 10 m thickness at the northern side of the Mur River draining the Alps. There is a gradual transition towards the southern part of domain IV that is reflected in slight shifts in (paleo-)vegetation and environment from periglacial conditions with tundra and forest-steppe towards drier steppe conditions. The boundary between domain III and IV follows approximately the southern limit of continuous permafrost (Figure 2). Thus, loess from the central and southern part of the Carpathian Basin does not belong to the same loess facies as the northern part (i.e. Moravia, the eastern parts of Austria and the northern Hungarian plain). Loess deposits from domain IV share more commonalities with the loess deposits of the Lower Danube Basin (domain V). However, modern and Pleistocene climate conditions differed between the Carpathian Basin (Middle Danube Basin) and the Lower Danube Basin: both are rather continental but the aridity is more pronounced in the latter one (Botti, 2018;Obreht et al., 2017).The loess deposits of the Carpathian Basin and adjacent areas are not as homogeneous as one might expect.

        <p>Generally, LPSs in the Middle Danube basin reflect typical loess plateau deposition (e.g. Marković et al., 2018a).

Drier conditions indicated better preservation of more complete LPS in the southeastern part of the Carpathian Basin (Marković et al., 2015(Marković et al., , 2008) ) and also higher sedimentation rates (Antoine et al., 2009a;Bokhorst et al., 2009;Sümegi et al., 2013;Újvári et al., 2017, 2010). The domain is positioned in an important geographic location, being close enough to the Atlantic Ocean to record its weakened influence, but at the same time isolated inland by surrounding mountains and partly protected from intensive cold Arctic air masses. Because of the geographic setting, climate and environmental conditions in the southeastern Carpathian Basin region were more stable than those elsewhere, as indicated by other European late Pleistocene loess-paleosol records (Antoine et al., 2001(Antoine et al., , 1999b;;Rousseau, 2001;Rousseau et al., 1998;Vandenberghe et al., 1998). The mechanisms behind dust accretion in loess plateaus seem to be restricted to steppe environments in which seasonal droughts during late summer and early autumn occur (Buggle et al., 2014(Buggle et al., , 2013)). In those climates of Cfb to Cfa type (Walter, 1974) biological loess crusts and mats play an important role serving as dust traps and possibly also facilitating loessification and transforming this way the semi-continuous accretion of dust to stable LPS (Svirčev et al., 2019). Together with the flora of the semi-desert to steppe environments the biocrusts effectively protect LPS from erosion and deflation leading to plateau deposits which record Pleistocene environmental history since the late Lower Pleistocene at least.Generally, LPSs in the Middle Danube basin reflect typical loess plateau deposition (e.g. Marković et al., 2018a).

        <p>The loess plateaus of domain IV are mainly located between the floodplains of the Danube River and its major tributaries, such as Tisa, Drava, Sava and Timis/Tamiš. Loess plateaus are remarkably thick at the confluences of the rivers, where deflatable material from both sides was deposited (Fitzsimmons et al., 2012;Marković et al., 2008). This indicates that the Danube River and its tributaries were important source areas during the Pleistocene, at least for the relatively coarsegrained silt and sand fractions (Bokhorst et al., 2011;Buggle et al., 2008;Smalley and Leach, 1978;Újvári et al., 2008), while smaller particles potentially can be of far-distance origin (Varga et al., 2019;Zeeden et al., 2016).

        <p>Loess and loess derivates are distinguished according to Lehmkuhl et al. (2018a). The lowermost and youngest terraces of the Tisa, Sava, and Danube rivers and their tributaries are covered by loess-like sediments and loess derivates and are therefore often referred to as loess terraces. The famous Titel loess plateau, which is situated in the Danube-Tisa-interfluve, can be clearly distinguished in the figure. Next to the Titel LPS (Bokhorst et al., 2009), also the 20 m thick Surduk LPS on the opposite bank of the Danube exhibits a very detailed record of the last interglacial-glacial cycle (Antoine et al., 2009a;Fuchs et al., 2008). Surduk is located at the edge of the Srem loess plateau, which has been formed between the Danube and Sava rivers at the southern and eastern slopes of the tectonically uplifted Fruška Gora Mountains. These mountains are surrounded to the south by a system of loess covered alluvial fans, with decreasing loess thickness upslope. This geomorphic situation influences e.g. the stratigraphic succession and the characteristics of paleosols (Vandenberghe et al., 2014b).Loess and loess derivates are distinguished according to Lehmkuhl et al.

        <p>Whereas the upslope section of Irig shows pure aeolian set-up, the downslope section of Ruma comprises a loess facies also characterized by intense sediment relocation (Marković et al., 2007(Marković et al., , 2006;;Vandenberghe et al., 2014b). The plateaus continue west of the Fruška Gora Mountains in eastern Croatian, where loess is regarded as generally pure or unaltered. Quaternary limnic, alluvial and marsh sediments are overlain by aeolian deposits in the Croatian part of the Carpathian Basin (e.g. Marković et al., 2009;Galović et al., 2011). .

The paleosols intercalating the loess are mostly Chernozem-type soils and brown forest soils (Bronger, 2003). The provenance of the material is similar to the Pannonian basin region with an evident, more local influence from southern provinces (e.g. Sava River southern tributaries originating from the Dinaride Ophiolite zone; (Galović, 2016)). A gradual increase in humidity is observed in the loess sequences going across the Pannonian region of Croatia towards the west. This increase persisted throughout all (or most) climatic shifts from the late glacial to today (Rubinić et al., 2018). A particularity of paleosols (mainly Stagnosols) in the western part of the Pannonian region in Croatia is that the increased distance to the source allowed pedogenesis to outcompete loess accumulation, so that no unaltered loess can be found in this area. (Antoine et al., 2019;Buggle et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2020;Haesaerts et al., 2003;Liang et al., 2016;Lomax et al., 2019;Necula et al., 2015a;Obreht et al., 2017;Rousseau et al., 2020Rousseau et al., , 2013Rousseau et al., , 2001;;Tecsa et al., 2020;Tsatskin et al., 1998;Velichko et al., 2009;Zeeden et al., 2018). In this area, there are no indications of permafrost and loess deposits developed under forest steppe and steppe conditions. This is also reflected in the distribution of modern topsoils, with recent Luvisols in the former forest steppes and Chernozems in the steppe areas (e.g. Velichko, 1990). Loess deposits are strongly influenced by the Danube River, the Carpathian Mountains and the Black Sea, but also the Don, Basin loess deposits are influenced by desert margin conditions with dust input from the East including endorheic basins and alluvial fans at the foot slopes of mountain ranges which both delivered deflatable silt (Vandenberghe et al., 2006). Interestingly thicknesses of paleosol and loess intervals are similar and grain sizes are getting finer in this area indicating continuous and steady input of far travelled dust (Chen et al., 2020). Towards the Caspian Basin, the loess cover gets generally thinner. The shelf of the Black Sea is not a dominant source area as LPS are thinning towards the coast (Jipa, 2014). This domain shows features which are commonly found in more arid landscapes e.g. in Central Asia, such as alkaline lakes, which are frequent in the rain shadow of the Carpathian Mountains in Lower Danube Basin and even north of the Black Sea coast.Šarengrad, Vukovar, Erdut and Zmajevac (Banak et al., 2016;Fenn et al., 2020;Galović et al., 2009;Wacha et al., 2013;Wacha and Frechen, 2011).

        <p>The southern part of this domain is dominated by the Lower Danube Basin (LDB) and the Dobrogea uplands. The LDB is strongly influenced by the Danube River and its tributaries, draining the eastern and southern Carpathians, as well as the Balkans. The basin is characterized by vast aeolian plateaus nested between major river valleys, and can be subdivided into the Wallachian Plain, the Bulgarian Plain, the forelands of Carpathians and Balkans, the Moldavian Plateau as well as the Dobrogea uplands (Jipa, 2014). The plains are usually covered with thick (tens of meters) Quaternary loess mantles, smoothing the landscape. In these areas the sediment covers are dissected by rivers forming loess bluffs at their banks (e.g. LPS Vlasca, Figs. 14). In contrast, the Dobrogea uplands consist of a limestone plateau, which shows a dendritic fluvial system which is mostly covered by loess deposits in variable thickness. Here, the thickest sections are usually available in abandoned quarries (e.g. LPS Mircea Voda and Urluia, Figure 14) or also as loess bluffs along valleys (e.g. LPS Rasova, Figure 14) or even in cliffs along the Danube and the Black Sea coast. In general, the sequences of the LDB show a broad variability in thickness and age: whereas some sections cover several glacial cycles (Costinești, Constantin et al., 2014;Mostiștea, Necula et al., 2015b;Urluia, Obreht et al., 2017). Albeit loess records in the region are laterally very consistent chronostratigraphically, thicknesses can also vary significantly. Additionally, several LPS preserve tephra layers (Italian, Carpathian Caucasian), in places in considerable thickness (Anechitei-Deacu et al., 2014;Antoine et al., 2019;Constantin et al., 2012;Lomax et al., 2019;Obreht et al., 2017;Veres et al., 2013;Zeeden et al., 2018).The southern part of this domain is dominated by the Lower Danube Basin (LDB) and the Dobrogea uplands.

Recent studies suggest that Pleistocene loess covers vast areas in the (peri) Mediterranean regions (Boixadera et al., 2015;Bosq et al., 2020a;Wacha et al., 2018;Wolf et al., 2019;Zerboni et al., 2018).This domain comprises loess and loess-like sediments in the Mediterranean area.

        <p>Loess in these regions does not reach the thickness of loess in central and eastern Europe and is often preserved as (relocated and weathered) loess-derivates. We present three subdomains: the western Mediterranean subdomain (VIa), the northern Mediterranean subdomain (VIb) and the eastern Mediterranean subdomain (VIc). A possible source for aeolian material besides globally distributed dust are the rivers (such as Ebro or Po), glacial and pro-glacial system at the margin of southern Alps, and glacial grinding from several paleoglaciation in the Mediterranean (Ehlers et al., 2011), especially on the Iberian Peninsula (summary in Oliva et al., 2019) and the Dinaric mountain ranges (e.g. Hughes et al., 2011). Moreover, periglacial weathering processes in the mountains and regional desert-like conditions and insolation weathering in the lowlands produced silt-sized particles. Dry emerged shelves are a further source of loess along shorelines.

        <p>Loess in southwestern Europe is mostly concentrated on the Iberian peninsula (e.g. Bertran et al., 2016). Aeolian deposits can be found in the lower Ebro Basin in northeastern Spain (Boixadera et al., 2015) and the upper Tagus Basin in central Spain (Wolf et al., 2019(Wolf et al., , 2018)). Boixadera et al. (2015) reported about loess deposits in the Ebro Basin that are generally 3-4 m thick and consist of wellsorted fine sands and silts, i.e., coarser than typical loess. Loess in central Spain is distributed along the upper Tagus River in elevations between 500 and 700 m a.s.l., covering fluvial terraces and depressions nearby. The Tagus loess reaches thicknesses of around 8 m and reveals high contents of calcium carbonate (between 30 and 40%) and soluble salts (~10 %) indicating that Tagus River deposits and weathered local marls were important loess sources during the Pleistocene (Wolf et al., 2019). In contrast to other European loess areas, paleosols generally show reddish colors and can be rated as Mediterranean Cambisols. In addition, there are some areas in the southern part of the lower Rhône and Rhône delta region, which can be attributed to this subdomain (see IIIa). Especially in the region of the Provence, Mediterranean influences on loess derivates lead to indicative soil formation such as Terra Rossa (Bosq et al., 2020a). Loess in this subdomain is distributed in elevations up to 707 m, with a median of 286 m (cf.

        <p>In this subdomain, loess formation is widely recorded along the margins of the Po Plain (Cremaschi et al., 2015) and the coastline of the northern and eastern Adriatic Sea and on the islands of Croatia (Cremaschi, 1990a;Wacha et al., 2018Wacha et al., , 2011b)). These deposits are summarized as the Po plain loess basin (Cremaschi, 2004(Cremaschi, , 1990a(Cremaschi, , 1987;;Zerboni et al., 2018). Moreover, loess is discontinuously distributed along the shorelines of the southern Adriatic, where it is mostly preserved at the top of limestone plateau (eventually recycled by pedogenesis) and within caves and rock shelters (Cremaschi, 2004;Cremaschi and Ferraro, 2007) and was occasionally described along the Tyrrhenian shorelines (Boretto et al., 2017). Loess in Italy originates from the deflation of the Upper Pleistocene fluvioglacial and fluvial deposits at the southern margin of the Alps, along the northern fringe Apennines and along the Adriatic shelf. Along the southern Adriatic and Tyrrhenian shorelines a further silt source are secondary tephra clasts deposited along the emerged shelf and later deflated inland (Cremaschi and Ferraro, 2007;Hirniak et al., 2020). It is also often overprinted by pedogenesis and thus its extent and paleoenvironmental significance were underestimated (Amit and Zerboni, 2013). A variety of soils are interbedded within loess sequences, including Chernozems, Alfisols, Cambisols and Luvisols, and occasionally layers of reworked loess are also present. Only a few sequences of thick, unweathered loess (e.g. the Val Sorda of Torino Hill sequence) and some complex pedosequences (e.g. Monte Netto) can be found in northern Italy (Cremaschi et al., 1990;Ferraro, 2009;Forno, 1990;Zerboni et al., 2015). The Val Sorda sequence, for instance, was preserved because it was capped by glacial deposits formed at the final LGM advance of the Garda Lake Glacier.In this subdomain, loess formation is widely recorded along the margins of the Po Plain (Cremaschi et al., 2015) and the coastline of the northern and eastern Adriatic Sea and on the islands of Croatia (Cremaschi, 1990a;Wacha et al., 2018Wacha et al., , 2011b)).

It is also often overprinted by pedogenesis and thus its extent and paleoenvironmental significance were underestimated (Amit and Zerboni, 2013). A variety of soils are interbedded within loess sequences, including Chernozems, Alfisols, Cambisols and Luvisols, and occasionally layers of reworked loess are also present. Only a few sequences of thick, unweathered loess (e.g. the Val Sorda of Torino Hill sequence) and some complex pedosequences (e.g. Monte Netto) can be found in northern Italy (Cremaschi et al., 1990;Ferraro, 2009;Forno, 1990;Zerboni et al., 2015). The Val Sorda sequence, for instance, was preserved because it was capped by glacial deposits formed at the final LGM advance of the Garda Lake Glacier.</p>
        <p>The majority, however, is deposited as sheets of wind-blown silt. Loess deposits are recurrent at several geomorphological settings along the southern margin of the Alps and the northern margin of the Apennines. These locations correspond to dissected fluvial terraces, pre-LGM glacial deposits, uplifted isolated hills and karst plateaus (Cremaschi, 2004;Zerboni et al., 2018). Occasionally, loess bodies can be found on top of polygenetic paleosols, inside sinkholes and trapped within caves and rock shelters, embedding anthropogenic deposits (Peresani et al., 2008).The majority, however, is deposited as sheets of wind-blown silt.

        <p>Additionally to the Italian loess deposits, this subdomain also consists of loess on the Adriatic coast of Croatia (e.g. Istrian Penisula: Zhang et al., 2018), including the islands of the Kvarner Bay (Profe et al., 2018b;Wacha et al., 2018). These deposits originate from Alpine glacial outwash plains in the Po Plain (Cremaschi, 1990a;Mikulčić Pavlaković et al., 2011), but are strongly influenced by Mediterranean climate (Profe et al., 2018b). The large glacio-fluvial outwash plains from the Pleistocene alpine glaciers in the northern Po Plain and the dry shelf of the Adriatic Sea provide additional dust sources. Heavy mineral assemblages of loess sequences from the two opposite sides of the Adriatic Sea (Monte Conero and Susak Island) suggest the same source of wind sediments, corresponding to the Upper Pleistocene alluvial plain of the Po River, today submerged by the Adriatic Sea (Cremaschi, 1990b).Additionally to the Italian loess deposits, this subdomain also consists of loess on the Adriatic coast of Croatia (e.g. Istrian Penisula: Zhang et al., 2018), including the islands of the Kvarner Bay (Profe et al., 2018b;Wacha et al., 2018).

        <p>Loess along the eastern Adriatic coast and on the islands directly covers the Cretaceous carbonate basement. The loess deposits are mostly coarser in grain size due to local winds than the loess in domain IV. At Susak, for example, the grain size is shifted toward fine sand (Wacha et al., 2018). On a more recent geological map of Croatian loess, Susak was mapped as sandy loess (Fuček et al., 2014).Loess along the eastern Adriatic coast and on the islands directly covers the Cretaceous carbonate basement.

        <p>It contains more paleosols compared to loess in eastern Croatia (domain IV). The soils are also more reddish in color, highlighting the Mediterranean climate influence (see stratigraphy in Figure 5). The thickness of the loess and loess derivates in the Adriatic region is quite small (Susak being the exception with ca. 30 m thick loess deposits) and for that reason they were mostly not presented on older maps. Its distribution is discontinuous and patchy. The loess in Istria, on the other hand, is finer grained compared to the Susak loess, and therewith more similar to typical loess in domain IV, but it also shows a higher degree of pedogenetic overprinting. The loess in the Adriatic region is mainly of last glacial age (Cremaschi et al., 2015;Wacha et al., 2011a;Zhang et al., 2018), but it is suggested that red paleosols below the loess on Susak formed on even older loess (Durn et al., 2018) as well as buried paleosols at Monte Netto (Delpiano et al., 2019;Zerboni et al., 2015).

        <p>There are several small patches of loess deposits in the basins and river valleys of the Balkans, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, southern Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia. These are scarcely described in the literature. However, these deposits exhibit unique geophysical and geochemical properties, reflecting the stronger influence of Mediterranean climate with more intensive weathering (Basarin et al., 2011;Bösken et al., 2017;Obreht et al., 2016Obreht et al., , 2014)). Based on the strong geochemical fingerprints of the silt originating from mafic rocks of surrounding mountains, the most plausible major source areas are local rivers (Obreht et al., 2016). An illustrative example for the alternating influence of the local rivers as a dust source is the Stalać LPS (Bösken et al., 2017;Obreht et al., 2016), which lies in the vicinity of the confluence of the South (Južna) Morava and the West (Zapadna) Morava rivers into the Great (Velika) Morava River. This setting of three river basins served as local dust source, making loess accumulation possible. This makes this section exceptional since it preserves several glacial-interglacial cycles (Bösken et al., 2017;Kostić and Protić, 2000;Obreht et al., 2016), while others usually cover just a part of the last glacial cycle (Basarin et al., 2011;Obreht et al., 2014). Consequently, the occurrence of the small patches of loess deposits in this subdomain is highly influenced by the local geomorphology and the extent of glaciers in the Balkan mountain ranges (Obreht et al., 2016). Results from LPS of the region show that the central Balkans are still under the influence of the westerlies from the Atlantic Ocean, but most prominently more continental and Mediterranean climatic conditions prevail in this region. Investigations showed that the climatic boundaries are sharp and fluctuated in the course of the Pleistocene. These fluctuations are e.g. imprinted in indicative (paleo-) soil properties (Obreht et al., 2016). However, the transitional region from the Balkans to the Carpathian Basin is characterized by loess that is more similar to plateau loess in domain IV with some characteristic of Mediterranean loess, e.g. Nosak andThere are several small patches of loess deposits in the basins and river valleys of the Balkans, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, southern Serbia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.

        <p>Maps of the distribution of aeolian sediments in Europe, either on a regional or continental scale, were compiled for almost a century (e.g. Antoine et al., 2003;Bertran et al., 2016;Fink et al., 1977;Fink and Nagl, 1979;Flint, 1971;Grahmann, 1932;Haase et al., 2007;Lehmkuhl et al., 2018aLehmkuhl et al., , 2018b;;Lindner et al., 2017;Zerboni et al., 2018). Especially the pan-European approaches are widely recognized and used as a basis for geospatial analysis and interpretation (e.g. Buggle et al., 2013Buggle et al., , 2008;;Fitzsimmons et al., 2012;Franc et al., 2017;Iovita et al., 2012;Lehmkuhl et al., 2016;Nawrocki et al., 2018;Sprafke and Obreht, 2016).

This collaborative effort was carried out by the INQUA Loess Commission under guidance of J. Fink. Similar to our approach, the Haase map is based on digitizing paper maps from numerous authors. This led e.g. to artificial breaks along borders, and the persistence of locally separated loess classes such as the alluvial loess in Hungary. Additionally, important loess areas, such as the whole Paris Basin, were not mapped by this approach.

These differences are also observed in southern Germany, Austria and Slovenia. Haase et al. (2007) included discontinuous and thin loess sediments in their map (cf.

        <p>In the southwestern Carpathian Basin, striking differences between the two mapping approaches are visible. This may be due to the uncertain data situation for the area.

        <p>These areas are influenced by e.g. slope processes, which can rework loess. We excluded data concerning reworked loess deposits (see Lehmkuhl et al., 2018b), since regional differences hamper a consistent mapping of these sediments. Differences in Hungary are related to the combination of aeolian sands and sandy loess in one unit in our map. In Romania on the other hand loess deposits were not mapped in detail in geological maps. Therefore, the map presented here is based on an approach that uses pedological maps (Lindner et al., 2017) and thus shows different loess distribution patterns. Haase et al. (2007) used a global stream network based on the grid cell boundaries of the GLOBE DEM (Hastings et al., 1999) to extract alluvial plains from the loess distribution. Since this DEM has a resolution of 1 km it is less precise than the pedological map we used in Ukraine (Sokolovsky et al., 1977b), leading to differences between both maps. Generally, we propose that our new map is more precise because in some areas updated maps were used, all data were critically checked by local experts, and our maps has a higher resolution. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to generate an absolutely accurate map since it is impossible to validate the loess distribution in all regions in detail.These areas are influenced by e.g. slope processes, which can rework loess.

        <p>Geological maps usually exclude the uppermost one to two meters below the surface. Therefore, this approach can be expected to miss some of the thin loess and sand covers thinner than one or two meters. This is especially the case in subdomains Ia and IIa. The underrepresentation of aeolian sands, e.g. in northern Germany, is also due to the exploration depth of geological maps, since the thicknesses of these covers are in many cases less than two meters and are therefore not mapped in geological maps (cf. Lehmkuhl et al., 2018b).Geological maps usually exclude the uppermost one to two meters below the surface.

        <p>As a result of the processing of the LUCAS data set, Bertran et al. (2016) classified aeolian sediments in Europe in four categories: loess, colluviated loess, silty sand and cover sands. These categories were set by combining the different grain size classes from the data set. The differing classification of aeolian sediments by this approach compared to our study hampers a direct comparison of all classes. Therefore, we only compare the classes loess and colluviated loess from Bertran et al. (2016) with the class loess and loess derivates from our study.As a result of the processing of the LUCAS data set, Bertran et al.

        <p>Vast covers of colluviated loess are mapped in some areas, such as basins within the Central European low mountain ranges (Figure 18). Colluviated loess is also mapped in e.g. geological maps in Germany (so-called 'Umlagerungsbildungen' or 'Schwemmlöss'; Lehmkuhl et al., 2018b), but their nomenclature is not consistent throughout Europe. Additionally, colluviated loess is usually not mapped in soil maps. To avoid issues and inconsistencies, we disregarded the direct mapping of every form of relocated aeolian sediments. Nevertheless, the class is included in the comparison since it overlaps largely with loess derivates in many regions.Vast covers of colluviated loess are mapped in some areas, such as basins within the Central European low mountain ranges (Figure 18).

        <p>The differences are most striking in the Central European mountain ranges and the Transylvanian Basin. The foothills of e.g. the Ore Mountains, the Sudetes, the Tatra and the Carpathians are affected. Within these regions, the differences are mostly due to mapped colluviated loess. In eastern Slovakia, however, there are vast areas of loess mapped by topsoil data, which were not included in geological maps. There are some areas where the mapped colluviated loess is congruent with loess and loess derivates. The loess deposits of these areas, e.g. the Moldavian plateau and the upper reaches of the Danube River, were mapped as colluviated loess by Bertran et al. (2016) and as loess and loess derivates in this study. Generally, the areas of colluviated loess according to Bertran et al.

        <p>Some inconsistencies between this study and Bertran et al. (2016) are noticeable especially within the Mediterranean realm and the coasts of Normandy and Brittany in northern France. In the Ebro basin in northern Spain and the Po plain in northern Italy, large areas of (colluviated) loess were mapped. This may be due to substrates with a similar granulometric signature as loess, such as weathered marls (Bosq et al., 2018). In studies following Bertran et al.

        <p>Figure 19 compares the atmospheric dust deposition of the dust cycle model (Schaffernicht et al., 2020) with the loess distribution and main domains established by this study. The dust deposition was modelled using a regional climate-dust model. However, this atmospheric dust modeling approach took only (far traveled) dust with small-sized particles of up to 20 μm diameter (fine-to medium silt) into account, while loess deposits mainly contain coarser silt particles. The modeled deposition rates from Schaffernicht et al. (2020), however, are in some contrast to the observed thicknesses of the loess deposits (Figure 19). The thickest loess deposits occur in central-eastern and southeastern Europe and not in the areas with the highest modeled rates. These differences can probably be explained by the degree of preservation. Differences in domain I could be due to insufficient vegetation cover that traps dust in the direct vicinity of the ice margins. Reworking, erosion and relocation of sediment is also present in the periglacially influenced regions of northern Europe. The model also indicates high deposition rates for high mountain areas, which is due to the consideration of only fine silt, since coarse silt is rarely transported to mountainous areas by wind.Figure 19 compares the atmospheric dust deposition of the dust cycle model (Schaffernicht et al., 2020) with the loess distribution and main domains established by this study.

        <p>Nevertheless, the model can be used to understand the atmospheric circulation patterns and the preservation potential of the different domains, although numerical models, due to their nature of being models, can never constitute complex natural process chains such as the uptake, transport and deposition of aeolian dust in appropriate spatial and temporal resolution. Large-scale models cannot display e.g. short term shifts in atmospheric circulations or sediment availability, which are indeed an important factor in dust deposition and loess formation (Antoine et al., 2009b).Nevertheless, the model can be used to understand the atmospheric circulation patterns and the preservation potential of the different domains, although numerical models, due to their nature of being models, can never constitute complex natural process chains such as the uptake, transport and deposition of aeolian dust in appropriate spatial and temporal resolution.

        <p>In contrast to the current climatic situation, during the LGM winds from northeast, east and southeast and cyclonic regimes prevailed over central Europe. While potentially a lot of dust deposited within domains I-III, the preservation potential especially in domain I was very low. The continentality and aridity, presumably coupled with appropriate dust traps (e.g. certain vegetation) in domains Ib, IId, IV, and V probably lead to the loess preservation we see in those regions today.In contrast to the current climatic situation, during the LGM winds from northeast, east and southeast and cyclonic regimes prevailed over central Europe.

        <p>Loess, loess derivates, sandy loess and aeolian sands are widely distributed throughout Europe. In domain I, between the ice sheets and the northern boundary of the European loess belt, patches of loess-like sediments, sandy loess, and widespread sand sheets (cover sands) appear. The boundary between the protogenetic zone and the northern European loess belt is in most regions clearly marked by the transition of sandy loess or sand sheets towards loess. Transitional zones can be found in northern France, Belgium or the Lower Rhine Embayment in Western Germany (subdomain IIa; see Vandenberghe in Schaetzl et al., 2018). In the central parts of domain II, a sharp and clear boundary of the loess distribution occurs -the loess-edge ramp (subdomain IIb, see Figure 9). These marginal steps vary in spatial distribution and shape inter alia due to the influences of and distance to the extending ice sheets. The main distribution of loess within domain II is located at the northern front of Central European low mountain ranges mainly between 105 to 231 m a.s.l (subdomains IIb).Loess, loess derivates, sandy loess and aeolian sands are widely distributed throughout Europe.

        <p>Domain II and III are strongly influenced by periglacial processes and permafrost.

For example, in the Rhône area of subdomain IIIa there is a gradual transition towards domain VIa, where Mediterranean conditions prevailed (Bosq et al., 2020a(Bosq et al., , 2020b)).

        <p>These transitions are characterized by increasing temperate to humid subtropical climate conditions with more intensive weathering and soil development in southwestern and southern Europe and to a more semi-arid desert margin environment with lack of humidity in the eastern and southeastern parts of Europe, respectively. In domain IV and V, loess dust accumulation occurred in plateau situations. Due to the local depositional conditions and relative extensive erosional processes, these plateaus were incised by the lowland rivers and are nowadays preserved between the alluvial plains of these rivers. They represent the most complete records of Quaternary paleoclimate and paleoenvironment in Europe beside few lake records. These plateaus are described in the literature (e.g. Marković et al., 2016;Smalley et al., 2011) and their genesis is discussed e.g. by Florea (2010).These transitions are characterized by increasing temperate to humid subtropical climate conditions with more intensive weathering and soil development in southwestern and southern Europe and to a more semi-arid desert margin environment with lack of humidity in the eastern and southeastern parts of Europe, respectively.

        <p>In other loess domains, such as the peri-alpine river valleys (IIIa-c) or Eastern Europe (V), aeolian sands originate from the deposits of larger rivers (e.g. Rhône, Rhine, and Danube River in subdomain III and VI; Dnieper and Dniester in domain V). The Danube River and its tributaries in the Carpathian Basin e.g. provide large quantities of silty and (fine) sandy material. When this material is deflated and subsequently deposited, a complex sedimentary pattern of loess, sandy loess and aeolian sands develops.

        <p>Throughout Europe, loess is mostly distributed in the basins and lowlands (northern France, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic; up to 600 m a.s.l.), the foothills of the Central European low mountain ranges (e.g. Central German low mountain ranges, Carpathian promontory, Fruška Gora Mountains, mainly below 200 m a.s.l.), and in favorable geomorphological settings, e.g. the larger valleys of the Rhône River and upper Rhine River (mainly below 300 to 400 m a.s.l.). In higher elevations, silt-sized particles of aeolian origin are usually mixed with periglacial cover beds building the upper cover bed (Lehmkuhl et al., 2016;Semmel and Terhorst, 2010). In the European Alps, Gild et al. (2018) used the term drape for aeolian mantles in the western part of the Northern Limestone Alps. They described drapes as aeolian covers of a few decimeters in thickness covering different bedrock and Pleistocene sediments. They are slightly modified by initial soil formation and late glacial in age. These drapes have also been described along valleys of the Italian Dolomites (Cremaschi andLanzinger, 1987, 1984). Usually no or only very limited typical loess deposits occur in the Pleistocene polar deserts in northern Europe of domain I, high-mountain areas or south of the Pleistocene timberline.Throughout Europe, loess is mostly distributed in the basins and lowlands (northern France, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic; up to 600 m a.s.l.), the foothills of the Central European low mountain ranges (e.g. Central German low mountain ranges, Carpathian promontory, Fruška Gora Mountains, mainly below 200 m a.s.l.), and in favorable geomorphological settings, e.g. the larger valleys of the Rhône River and upper Rhine River (mainly below 300 to 400 m a.s.l.).

        <p>The distribution of aeolian sediments is mainly controlled by sediment availability, prevalent wind directions and the presence of suitable dust traps. The sediment availability is dependent on the distance to potential source areas such as larger river systems (e.g. Smalley et al., 2009;Smalley and Leach, 1978), dry shelves (Antoine et al., 2009a) or glacio-fluvial outwash plains of ice sheet margins (e.g. Antoine et al., 2016;Lehmkuhl et al., 2016;Pye, 1995). The vegetation density in the source areas also governs the amount of dust, which can be deflated, since vegetation acts as a dust trap and fixes the sediment. It is obvious that the distribution of loess is closely linked to the distribution of these source areas (Figure 2). The vastest and most prominent loess deposits occur south of the ice margin and along large rivers, where during the Quaternary large amounts of sediment were available with no or very spare vegetation covers.The distribution of aeolian sediments is mainly controlled by sediment availability, prevalent wind directions and the presence of suitable dust traps.

        <p>The local geomorphological setting of sink areas strongly influenced the distribution, preservation and thickness of loess sequences. Several depositional settings such as plateau and interfluve loess, slope loess, colluvial (slope toe) loess, loess sedimentation in depressions and erosion channels (valley loess) were distinguished (see Lehmkuhl et al., 2016 and references therein). Higher accumulation rates were observed e.g. in depressions or on lee sites of topographic barriers, according to the prevailing wind direction (e.g. Figure 6, Antoine et al., 2003).

(Lehmkuhl et al., 2016). In domains IV and V dust sedimentation on plateaus is considered continuous since the Middle Pleistocene (Basarin et al., 2014;Marković et al., 2015).

        <p>To summarize, loess in Europe was formed, preserved, overprinted, reworked and relocated through a multitude of different geomorphological, sedimentological and pedological processes. These variations and differences are the results of a complex interplay of paleoclimate, paleoenvironment and geomorphology. Additionally, there is a strong dependence on the distance to the ice sheets and local source areas ((glacio-) fluvial, alluvial, dry shelves), as well as prevailing paleo-wind systems.To summarize, loess in Europe was formed, preserved, overprinted, reworked and relocated through a multitude of different geomorphological, sedimentological and pedological processes.

Whereas mainly Pécsi (e.g. 1990) developed many criteria for a loess definition from the latter direction, others like Pye (1995), used a more simple definition for loess as wind-blown dust (see the summarizing discussion in Smalley et al., 2011). Besides the definition of loess itself, which is still under discussion (Sprafke and Obreht, 2016), different modes of loess genesis are described in literature. Muhs and his co-workers summarized, developed and focused on models of "glacial loess" (cold loess, higher latitude loess) and "desert loess" (warm loess) formation (Lancaster, 2020;Muhs, 2013;Muhs and Bettis, 2003;Schaetzl et al., 2018;Wright, 2001). Lately, Li et al. (2020) suggested three modes for the global loess genesis: continental glacier provenance-river transport, mountain provenance-river transport, and mountain provenance-river transport-desert transition.There is a multitude of approaches to differentiate the genesis of loess deposits.

        <p>However, there is not only the "glacial loess" versus "non-glacial" formation in Europe. The main factors for loess formation are the amount of available dust (Crouvi et al., 2010;Maher et al., 2003) and the degree of humidity (semi-arid to semi-humid conditions) as well as its seasonality. In the more humid regions, pedogenesis dominates especially during the interglacials and amounts of incoming far traveled dust are reduced in volume and immediately trapped and altered by soil formation processes. In the semi-arid regions, however, dust can accrete also during interglacial periods lowering but not inhibiting intensity of soil formation (Constantin et al., 2019;Tecsa et al., 2020;Varga et al., 2016). Additionally, (paleo-) environmental factors play an important role for the accumulation and especially the preservation of dust aggradations. They determine the boundaries of vegetation zones and the permafrost distribution, which in turn influence dust trapping, weathering and erosional processes. A conceptual model of glacial loess genesis for Europe was already proposed by Zeuner (1937). Anticyclonal synoptic patterns controlled by the Scandinavian and Alpine ice sheets and their interplay with westerlies are the main element of this concept, in which strong anticyclonal winds are responsible for dust uptake and transport and tundra/steppe vegetation benefitting from humidity brought in by the westerlies controlled trapping and stabilization of dust. According to various authors, the trapping of dust is mostly related to the vegetation cover (e.g. Danin and Ganor, 1991;Hatté et al., 2013;Tsoar and Pye, 1987;Zech et al., 2013) or biocrusts (Svirčev et al., 2019(Svirčev et al., , 2013)). As it is assumed that the most common dust traps are grasses (or possibly biocrusts as part of the steppe/tundra flora), the lack of widespread loess deposits south of the northern timberline during the LGM might be explained by this model. In addition to reduced dust sources, there is increasing pedogenesis towards more humid regions.However, there is not only the "glacial loess" versus "non-glacial" formation in Europe.

        <p>However, in any loess deposition, after sedimentation and initial fixation of atmospheric mineral dust particles, first post-sedimentary alteration processes occur (Berg, 1916;Pécsi, 1990;Smalley et al., 2011;Svirčev et al., 2013;Smalley and Marković, 2014). It is a matter of debate whether such processes should be assigned to pedogenic or diagenetic process spheres or to a kind of transition zone (Sprafke and Obreht, 2016). However, there is consensus that the typical structure of a loess deposit is caused by these initial alteration processes, whereby the loess differs from primary airborne dust (Pécsi, 1990;Sprafke and Obreht, 2016;Schulte and Lehmkuhl 2018). Besides the factors influencing the mobilization, transport and sedimentation of the loess e.g. distance to source areas or wind velocity (Újvári et al., 2016;Vandenberghe, 2013Vandenberghe, , 2018)), the post-depositional alterations such as chemical weathering or colluviation also have a considerable influence on the grain size composition of the loess deposits (Schulte and Lehmkuhl, 2018;Újvári et al., 2016). Grainsize distribution of loess can serve as an indicator to distinguish among loess and loess-like deposits (Vandenberghe et al., 2018), and may give insight into different acting processes. Coarser deposits formed e.g. under the influence of stronger wind activities or under the influence of non-aeolian processes, such as slope wash or soil creep.

        <p>are the result of large distances to the source region, weaker wind conditions, and / or postdepositional alterations such as pedogenesis (Újvári et al., 2016;Vandenberghe, 2013Vandenberghe, , 2018;;Schulte and Lehmkuhl 2018). Desiccation due to low temperatures and frost enhanced the availability of small-sized particles (Smalley, 1995). Precipitation mainly occurred as snow during the cold season. This produced high meltwater discharge with its maximum during summer in glacial regions and/or during springtime in periglacial regions, respectively. This resulted in large braided river systems, which fell dry in late summer to autumn and during wintertime. During low water stands, floodplains acted as important sand and silt source areas, especially in autumn (Sima et al., 2009;Smalley et al., 2009). Material from glacial grinding and frost weathering in particular lead to the silt production and accumulation in the floodplains during high discharge seasons (in Europe mainly in the Pleistocene). Therefore, small-sized particles were available but also sands, especially close to rivers, are still found. In general, the dominance of coarse grain sizes (sand-sized particles) increases toward the polar and glacier region. The transport and relocation depended on the humidity, which enforced relocation by slope wash and solifluction. Li et al. (2020) proposed the continental glacier provenance-river transport and mountain provenance-river transport modes for such environments. Although loesslike sediments and loess derivates formed in these environments, the lack of a stabilization process as observed in more arid regions and prevalent geomorphic conditions have caused discordances and hiati. Such loess deposits are very characteristic for domains I -III and mostly formed during cold stadial conditions. Sometimes nivo-aeolian features formed under more humid conditions (depicted as diagonally shaped triangle edge). Other deposits outside of Europe also fall in this part of the conceptual model. For example, the ultimate member on the nival-arid axis are arctic ice silts known as Yedoma deposits. They are found in the permafrost landscapes of Beringia (Central and Eastern Siberia, Alaska and Northern Canada) and contain ice-saturated or supersaturated silt and fine sand sediments (Strauss et al., 2017). They are characterized by a segregation ice content of 30-40% and syngenetic ice wedges (Strauss et al., 2017). Several hypothesis concerning their genesis have been proposed. Researchers working in the Yukon area and Alaska often characterize Yedoma silts as loess or re-transported loess (Péwé, 1955;Sanborn et al., 2006). According to Schirrmeister et al. (2013), a polygenetic hypothesis with a distinct aeolian input is the most popular in the recent scientific literature. Strauss et al.

        <p>We suggest that parts of domain I and IIc-d were influenced by such nival-arid conditions during the Pleistocene.

        <p>The lower right side of the triangle depicts the loess deposits in arid and semi-arid region, e.g. domains V and VIc. These deposits range from silty loess towards more sandy loess in the direction of increasing aridity. The nival-arid axis is distributed more towards the continental areas (domains Ib -IId -V) whereas the humid-arid axis is the transition from domain IV to V. Especially domain IV and the western part of domain V are situated more the center of the triangle. Desert environments are located at the extreme end and are strictly speaking not found in Europe, but it is debatable if some deposits e.g. in Spain and southeastern Europe, were formed under arid and desert margin conditions. In these landscape, dry riverbeds and exposed lacustrine deposits act as source areas for aeolian deflation also for mid-and long-distance transport of silt-sized particles. While in the center of the triangle, that depicts 'typical' loess, continuous and silt-sized dominated loess formation take place (e.g. domain IV, most parts of V), a gradual increase in the contribution of sand-sized particles toward the arid corner is observed. Beside the proximity of source areas (e.g. large streams in Europe; e.g. Jipa, 2014) also a reduced vegetation cover lead to the formation of sandy loess deposits and sand formation especially at the desert margins of the world (e.g. Central Asian deserts, deserts in China). This transition towards the desert margin loess can be found e.g. in eastern and southeastern Europe towards Central Asia (e.g. Sea of Azov (Chen et al., 2020), and Caspian Lowlands (Wei et al., 2020), where the fine and medium silt content of LPS is increased pointing to a contribution of far traveled dust. Moreover, a general and continuous contribution of long range transported dust input stemming from desert margins in the Caspian Lowlands and western Central Asia is likely for southeastern European and western Central Asian Holocene and older interglacial soils (Constantin et al., 2019;Jordanova and Jordanova, 2020;Tecsa et al., 2020;Zhang et al., 2020).The lower right side of the triangle depicts the loess deposits in arid and semi-arid region, e.g. domains V and VIc.

        <p>Please note that there was and still is also a long range transport of aeolian dust from desert regions (Goudie, 1983(Goudie, , 1978;;Schütz, 1980), (Goudie, 1983(Goudie, , 1978;;Schütz, 1980), which plays an important role in the global climate system (Lancaster, 2020).

However, during the last decade this dust contribution was realized for being relevant for the entire Circum-Saharan realm and hence, also for the loess areas of south and southeastern Europe and may be increased during interglacial times when the deserts tend to expand (Muhs et al., 2010;von Suchodoletz et al., 2010).Please note that there was and still is also a long range transport of aeolian dust from desert regions (Goudie, 1983(Goudie, , 1978;;Schütz, 1980), (Goudie, 1983(Goudie, , 1978;;Schütz, 1980), which plays an important role in the global climate system (Lancaster, 2020).

        <p>These processes enhanced the in situ formation of clay-sized particles thereby reducing the amount of coarser (silt-sized) particles. Additionally, higher clay contents of more than 20 % and cementation processes hampered deflation (Pye, 1995). This conceptual zone is limited towards its corner by the timberline, since no loess deposits were formed under dense forest. Our proposed temperate and subtropical loess and the paleosols formed within were mainly developed in regions with a distinct dry season (summer or winter, e.g. towards the Mediterranean regions with winter rainfall or in monsoonal regions with summer rainfall). Dust sources in these regions are and were mainly local and smaller in comparison to the other loess landscapes due to the higher vegetation cover and fewer dry river beds.These processes enhanced the in situ formation of clay-sized particles thereby reducing the amount of coarser (silt-sized) particles.

        <p>Such humid loess deposits can be found at the foothills of the Carpathians in the Romanian Banat (Kels et al., 2014), in Transcarpathia (Ukraine) between steppe and boreal forest at higher elevation (Nawrocki et al., 2016). Such setting with changes between more humid loess environments and more typical loess environment is also developed at the upper reaches of the Dniester between the southern margin of the Scandinavian ice sheet and north of the Carpathian Mountains at the transition of the forest refugia in higher altitudes and the tundra environments towards the ice margin (Łanczont et al., 2019). Another example for subtropical loess and soil formation is the Stalać LPS in subdomain VIc (Bösken et al., 2017;Obreht et al., 2016). Last glacial and penultimate glacial paleosols are strongly weathered and the latter are expressed as reddish Cambisols highlighting the occurrence of humid Mediterranean paleoenvironmental conditions during their formation. A similar setting is realized at the foothills of the southern Alps at the transition to the Po-plain (Zerboni et al., 2015). However, humid loess can be found in the subtropical regions of China (see below) and in South America (e.g. Campodonico et al., 2019). A potential example of humid loess could be also the loess from New Zealand, which is characterized by high contribution of clay and very low carbonate content (Smalley, 1971), probably due to dissolution caused by high amounts of rainfall.Such humid loess deposits can be found at the foothills of the Carpathians in the Romanian Banat (Kels et al., 2014), in Transcarpathia (Ukraine) between steppe and boreal forest at higher elevation (Nawrocki et al., 2016).

        <p>Nevertheless, we highlight that the formation of such loess is scarce in Europe during the last glacial cycle, where an increase in humidity in temperate and subtropical areas was mostly related to pedogenesis and weathering resulted in accretionary soils. These soils contain only minor amounts of mineral dust and are therefore strictly speaking no proper loess deposits. In these cases, soil formation outpaced dust accumulation.Nevertheless, we highlight that the formation of such loess is scarce in Europe during the last glacial cycle, where an increase in humidity in temperate and subtropical areas was mostly related to pedogenesis and weathering resulted in accretionary soils.

        <p>Finally, primary or typical loess is usually not formed in any of the extreme conditions (triangle corners) indicated in our conceptual model of loess landscape. We propose that this loess formation occurred mainly during colder periods of the Pleistocene. However, in domain IV and partly in domain V these processes continued at least also during the Holocene (Chen et al., 2018;Tecsa et al., 2020;Zeeden et al., 2018). When conditions become fully nival, humid or arid, already formed loess is strongly altered, and the formation of thick and quasi-continuous silty deposit can be still ongoing.Finally, primary or typical loess is usually not formed in any of the extreme conditions (triangle corners) indicated in our conceptual model of loess landscape.

Under extreme arid conditions, the lack of vegetation and biogenically induced loessification can make loess vulnerable to aeolian deflation and other types of erosion. This includes the preferential deflation of silty material, leaving only coarser components in the source areas.However, conditions indicated as extreme in the triangle have a potential to ultimately alter the loess in a way that its silt-sized origin is largely replaced by finer, strongly weathered material.

        <p>The conceptual triangle also has relevance if used vertically. Towards higher elevation in more humid mountain regions of Europe, we reach a zone of periglacial and glacial dynamics, yet loess formation is quantitatively reduced by the lack of stable surfaces to support long-lasting dust accumulation (see the discussion in Chapter 4.2 of the distribution of loess in the European Alps; e.g. Gild et al, 2018). In addition, in the rather high mountains and plateaus of arid Central Asia, e.g. the Tibetan Plateau and Qilian Shan, mountain loess deposits are found (Lehmkuhl et al., 2014(Lehmkuhl et al., , 2000;;Nottebaum et al., 2015Nottebaum et al., , 2014;;Stauch et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2020). The uppermost boundary of loess is periglacial loess, whereas the lowermost parts are desert margin loess (described in Nottebaum et al., 2015Nottebaum et al., , 2014)).The conceptual triangle also has relevance if used vertically.

In addition, in the rather high mountains and plateaus of arid Central Asia, e.g. the Tibetan Plateau and Qilian Shan, mountain loess deposits are found (Lehmkuhl et al., 2014(Lehmkuhl et al., , 2000;;Nottebaum et al., 2015Nottebaum et al., , 2014;;Stauch et al., 2012;Yang et al., 2020). The uppermost boundary of loess is periglacial loess, whereas the lowermost parts are desert margin loess (described in Nottebaum et al., 2015Nottebaum et al., , 2014)).</p>
        <p>For these regions, there are still debates on the influence of glaciers and deserts in loess formation.For these regions, there are still debates on the influence of glaciers and deserts in loess formation.</p>
        <p>To further test if the conceptual model is applicable to regions outside Europe, we exemplify here the model for the Chinese Loess Plateau. In the Chinese Loess Plateau there is a gradual transition in grain-size from the more humid monsoonal areas in the Southeast (left side of the triangle in Figure 20) towards the semi-arid and arid regions with desert margin loess in the northwest (right side of the triangle, e.g. Bloemendal et al., 2008;Derbyshire et al., 1995;Yang and Ding, 2003). The thick beds of primary loess in western Manchuria (Obruchev, 1945) and in the mountain areas of western China could be placed in the upper half of our triangle towards the nival environments. These loess landscapes are also influenced by periglacial processes and slope wash (top of the triangle).To further test if the conceptual model is applicable to regions outside Europe, we exemplify here the model for the Chinese Loess Plateau.

        <p>Moreover, in southern China, e.g. in the Sichuan Basin, there is a debate on subtropical and strongly weathered aeolian (loess) deposits (Feng et al., 2014;Yang et al., 2010). This fits well to the subtropical loess landscapes on the humid-arid axis of our conceptual model. Feng et al. (2014) provides evidence that the Chengdu Clay contains aeolian material of possibly local origin. They assume alluvial sediments in the northwestern Sichuan Basin as the major source and transportation of the material by an ancient katabatic wind over a short distance during glacial and stadial periods (subtropical). Even further north of the desert regions of Central Asia we reach another zone of desert margin loess (e.g. in Tajikistan (Ding et al., 2002) or Kazakhstan (Rao et al., 2013)), whereas in northern Mongolia and Siberia periglacial or mountain loess appears (Andreeva et al., 2011;Lehmkuhl et al., 2012Lehmkuhl et al., , 2011;;Muhs, 2014).Moreover, in southern China, e.g. in the Sichuan Basin, there is a debate on subtropical and strongly weathered aeolian (loess) deposits (Feng et al., 2014;Yang et al., 2010).

        <p>The new loess map of Europe focusses on processes and paleoenvironments of the LGM as reference period, but as climate changes, the conditions for loess formation and distribution within our conceptual triangle are also shifting. This implies changing environments of loess formation through both, space and time. We want to focus here especially on the Middle Pleistocene environments. For example, ice sheets extended further south during the penultimate and older glaciations compared to the last glacial cycle. Figure 21 indicates the extent of the Saalian and Elsterian ice sheets in the northern part of Europe modified according to Ehlers (2011). The extent of Elsterian and Saalian ice sheets was more than 100 km further south in England and more than 300 km further south in the North Sea west of Denmark when compared to the Weichselian ice sheets. Such extent of ice sheets also influenced the different loess domains, since larger areas were covered by ice (such as IIb and partly IIc) and thus the dust deflation and accumulation areas shifted further south. Furthermore, there were enlarged ice dammed and proglacial lakes close to the ice margins during the Middle Pleistocene. For example, Supplementary Figure S3 shows that a 120,000km² large glacial lake in the southern North Sea existed from around 450,000 to 400,000 years ago (Gibbard, 2007). The North Sea area was covered by both, larger lakes and larger ice sheets during the Elsterian. This area of more than 220,000 km² reduced silt production potential greatly. This is particularly relevant since the same area was a very important potential source of dust at other times (e.g. after the "catastrophic" flooding in MIS 12). Especially the larger extent of ice might be the main reason for the limited accumulation of loess in domain II during the time of older glaciations. For example, older loess deposits in northern France are thin non-calcareous and non-typical sandy loess deposits, which accumulated between about 600 and 420 ka close to the former slopes.The new loess map of Europe focusses on processes and paleoenvironments of the LGM as reference period, but as climate changes, the conditions for loess formation and distribution within our conceptual triangle are also shifting.

        <p>During the end of the Middle Pleistocene (between about 380 and 180 ka), sandy loess was deposited in sediment traps such as sinkholes in the chalk bedrock or more frequently as cover sequences on river terraces and has been preserved until today. Its composition suggests a distinct proportion of local sources (i.e. sands from braided rivers). However, the coarse silt fraction, probably from more distant sources (we speculate that the eastern channel was a main source area), increased in frequency over time. Extensive deposition and preservation of calcareous loess over the plateaus and on downwind slopes of the asymmetric valleys (NE-SE exposures) occurred only during the late Saalian stage (MIS 6, ±150-135 ka; Antoine et al., 2016). They are clearly distinguished from older loess by an especially high amount of green amphibole in the heavy minerals assemblages (Meijs, 2002;Pirson et al., 2018).During the end of the Middle Pleistocene (between about 380 and 180 ka), sandy loess was deposited in sediment traps such as sinkholes in the chalk bedrock or more frequently as cover sequences on river terraces and has been preserved until today.

        <p>The unprecedented increase in loess sedimentation at the end of MIS 6 is also observed in Belgium at Kesselt (Nelissen), where the "B loess" reaches a thickness of 6 to 10 m and contains distinct periglacial features (Meijs, 2002). In Germany, some Middle Pleistocene loess layers have also been preserved, especially in the Lower Rhine Bight (opencast lignite mines Garzweiler and Inden, Fischer et al., 2012) and in the Middle Rhine area (East Eifel volcanic field: e.g. Boenigk andFrechen, 2001a, 2001b).The unprecedented increase in loess sedimentation at the end of MIS 6 is also observed in Belgium at Kesselt (Nelissen), where the "B loess" reaches a thickness of 6 to 10 m and contains distinct periglacial features (Meijs, 2002).

The ice sheets extended further south compared to the last glacial-interglacial cycle. These shifts pushed not only the known paleoclimatic and paleoenrivonmental boundaries such as the permafrost boundary or the timberline further south, they also had crucial ramifications on the size, nature and location of silt production and deposition areas. Additionally, paleogeographic factors such as a vast Elsterian glacial lake in the North Sea Basin, reduced the extent of potential source areas for dust deflation. These factors as well as the periglacial overprinting of loess deposits in subsequent glacial periods, led to the poor preservation of Middle Pleistocene loess deposits, especially in Northern Europe.The loess deposits in Europe show remarkable differences regarding their distribution and characteristics.
