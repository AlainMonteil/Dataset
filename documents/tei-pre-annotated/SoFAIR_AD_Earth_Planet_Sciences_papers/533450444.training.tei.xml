        <p>In their seminal monograph 'Molecular Theory of Capillarity', Rowlinson and Widom describe different possible shapes of density profiles at the vapor-liquid interface of mixtures. They postulated that in some instances, density profiles could possibly be non-monotonic, exhibiting either a maximum and/or a minimum. This contribution revisits this statement in the light of four decades of posterior research. We summarize the distinct morphologies at the vapor-liquid interface suggested in the literature recognizing that the condition of a single minimum in the profile has not yet been reported. Interfacial density profiles with a single maximum as well as fully monotonic density profiles have been observed and reported extensively. The case of a simultaneous maximum and minimum is more controversial, as it has only been predicted using theoretical approaches such as density gradient theory (DGT). This ambiguity is further investigated in this work using the example of the vaporliquid interface of cyclohexane + butanol. Both DGT in combination with several distinct equations of state and molecular dynamics simulations are used. The results from the two methods are found to be contradictory: while the DGT results predict a maximum/minimum structure, the computer experiment results indicate only a single maximum in the density profiles. This work thereby emphasizes that results from DGT for highly non-ideal mixtures should not be taken for granted.In their seminal monograph 'Molecular Theory of Capillarity', Rowlinson and Widom describe different possible shapes of density profiles at the vapor-liquid interface of mixtures.

        <p>The reliable prediction and modeling of interfacial properties of mixtures is critical for the design of chemical, biological, and physical processes. Unfortunately, the molecular structure of fluid interfaces is challenging to probe using experimental methods due to the dynamical nature of the interface. The rapid thermal fluctuations at fluid interfaces and sharp density gradients occurring over the length of nanometers conspire against the experimental efforts to characterize the interfacial region. However, density and pressure profiles can be predicted by molecular modeling and simulation, namely molecular simulations using classical force field models [1][2][3] or theoretical methods such as density gradient theory (DGT) and density functional theory (DFT) [4][5][6][7] in conjunction with molecular-based free energy models [8][9][10] or structure based models (for example the Born-Green-Yvon approach (BGY) [7,[11][12][13]). While molecular simulations can be applied in a strictly predictive manner in many cases and are therefore usually considered as reference, DGT and DFT usually require to some extent the parametrization of substance-specific model parameters. In spite that, both DGT and DFT are usually parameterized using macroscopic VLE property data, nanoscopic interfacial properties such as the density profiles are predicted by the theories.The reliable prediction and modeling of interfacial properties of mixtures is critical for the design of chemical, biological, and physical processes.

        <p>Density profiles of vapor-liquid interfaces of mixtures may exhibit a non-monotonic behavioralso at equilibrium states, when the free energy is minimized. The monotonicity behavior of vapor-liquid interfaces of mixtures is of particular interest as non-monotonic density profiles are suspected to influence the mass transfer across interfaces [14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. The inference of the general shapes of the vapor-liquid density profiles is the starting point of all theoretical studies on interfacial properties [19,20,[25][26][27][28][29]]. Yet, no generally accepted framework has been established on the possible structures that can be expected at vapor-liquid interfaces, i.e. their topology. In their pioneering monograph Rowlinson and Widom [5] postulated the possibility for a maximum in the interfacial density profile as well as the possibility for a minimum in an interfacial density profile, which is continually recapitulated [30][31][32]. This work challenges this picture by reviewing which cases of interfacial structure have to date been confirmed and which are still disputable. It is pointed out that a minimum in interfacial density profiles has only been reported in the literature in conjunction with a maximum [33][34][35][36][37] so far to be considered a special and disputed case. An exemplary case (the mixture cyclohexane + n-butanol) is discussed in detail here using both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and DGT. It is shown that the results from the two independent methods are contradictory: the density profiles obtained from molecular simulations yield a single maximum, whereas DGT predicts a maximum/minimum structure.Density profiles of vapor-liquid interfaces of mixtures may exhibit a non-monotonic behavioralso at equilibrium states, when the free energy is minimized.

        <p>This work is outlined as follows: the current status on the knowledge of vapor-liquid density profiles of mixtures is discussed regarding what types of structures are generally possible and what structures have so far been observed. We propose a classification scheme, highlighting uncovered ambiguities in the literature. In the second section, we provide definitions of the interfacial properties used to quantify interfacial excess and discuss benefits, drawbacks, and pitfalls of different observables (which have at times caused confusion in the literature regarding the monotonicity behavior). The third section presents and discusses the interfacial properties results for the mixture cyclohexane + n-butanol from MD and DGT.This work is outlined as follows: the current status on the knowledge of vapor-liquid density profiles of mixtures is discussed regarding what types of structures are generally possible and what structures have so far been observed.

        <p>For vapor-liquid interfaces, two types of phenomena causing a nonmonotonicity in density profiles can be generally distinguished: (1) the so-called surface activity featuring a single maximum or minimum or a combined maximum/minimum structure and (2) an oscillatory layering structure (OLS). Fig. 1 schematically shows these interfacial structures: Fig. 1(a)-(d) depict different types of surface activity and Fig. 1(e) the OLS. It should be noted that the classification scheme proposed in Fig. 1 is designed for vapor-liquid interfaces, i.e. liquid-liquid and dense fluidfluid interfaces as well as fluid interfaces at three-phase equilibria may exhibit additional features [21,[38][39][40].For vapor-liquid interfaces, two types of phenomena causing a nonmonotonicity in density profiles can be generally distinguished: (1) the so-called surface activity featuring a single maximum or minimum or a combined maximum/minimum structure and (2) an oscillatory layering structure (OLS).

        <p>The phenomenon of a single extremum (cf. Fig. 1a-d) is intimately linked to the phase behavior of a mixture [27,38,41]. This type of non-monotonicity is usually referred to as enrichment or surface activity. It can only exist at interfaces of mixtures. The oscillatory layering structure on the other hand is a purely structural phenomenon consisting of multiple extrema in density profiles (cf. Fig. 1(e)) with decaying amplitude towards the bulk liquid phase. It can occur at both pure substance and mixture vapor-liquid interfaces [16,33,[42][43][44][45]. The vapor bulk phase of a vapor-liquid interface acts as an external field causing a layering of particles in the liquid phase with respect to the surfacesimilar to the adsorption phenomenon at solid-fluid interfaces. The OLS can be considered as the 'ending' of the radial distribution function of the liquid phase at the interface. The density decay from the liquid surface into the liquid bulk phase can occur with exponentially damped oscillations or be a monotonic decayin accordance with the crossover between the oscillatory and monotonic decay of correlation functions in the bulk fluid. Hence, the occurrence and magnitude of an OLS depends on the temperature and pressure. The OLS is usually prominent at low temperatures, where the interface is thin and thermal fluctuations are only faint. The OLS can be captured by DFT, molecular simulations, and also BGY models [13,42], but is precluded in DGT [42,46] due to the underlying assumptions in the theory. Moreover, the OLS sampled from molecular simulations are strongly affected by surface wave fluctuations [42,47], which decreases the amplitude of the layering structure.The phenomenon of a single extremum (cf.

        <p>The OLS is a structural phenomenon affecting the entire liquid phase, i.e. all components, whereas the surface activity is usually found to only affect the low-boiling component in binary mixtures. The peak height of the surface activity is often on the order of magnitude of the density difference of the bulk phases. The peak height of the OLS is usually significantly smaller (but strongly depends on the method) than that of the surface activity, cf. Fig. 1. The surface activity non-monotonicity is usually located central at a vapor-liquid interface, i.e. it can not be unambiguously assigned to either the liquid or the vapor side of the interface and is an inherent part of the interphase. The OLS on the other hand occurs on the liquid side of the interface. In general, the two nonmonotonicity morphologies may be present simultaneously causing the two structural phenomena to be superimposing each other, cf. Refs. [16,33,48].The OLS is a structural phenomenon affecting the entire liquid phase, i.e. all components, whereas the surface activity is usually found to only affect the low-boiling component in binary mixtures.

        <p>When discussing the surface activity, four main types of structures could be postulated in general, cf. Fig. 1(a)-(d). They are labeled here type i-iv. For all four types, the high-boiling component density usually exhibits a monotonic transition between the two bulk phases [41]. In the case of azeotropic mixtures, the high-boiling component changes at the azeotropic point, which also causes a switchover in the density profile monotonicity behavior between the two components [40,49].When discussing the surface activity, four main types of structures could be postulated in general, cf.

        <p>Depending on the monotonicity type, the low-boiling component may exhibit a monotonic or non-monotonic transition between the bulk phases, cf. Fig. 1(a)-(d). The surface activity monotonicity type is known to be directly linked to the phase behavior of the mixture [15,27,38,41,50]. For type i behavior, the low-boiling component density exhibits a monotonic transition between the bulk phases. This type of structural behavior is often found and has been predicted by both theory (DGT or DFT) and computer experiment [41,51]. Both, ideal mixtures and high-boiling azeotropic mixtures are usually found to be of type i [15,40,41,41,50,51]. In the case of type ii behavior, the low-boiling component density exhibits a single distinct maximum. This structure type has been frequently confirmed in the literature by both theory and computer experiments [41]. Type ii is often observed for low-boiling azeotropic mixtures and mixtures with a supercritical component [20,40,49,50,52,53].Depending on the monotonicity type, the low-boiling component may exhibit a monotonic or non-monotonic transition between the bulk phases, cf.

        <p>While both type i and type ii behavior have been observed multiple times in the literature [41], type iii interfacial behavior has, to the best of our knowledge, not yet been predicted by either computer simulations or a theory. This is intriguing since this type has been postulated by Rowlinson and Widom [5] and since then endorsed several times, e.g. Refs. [30][31][32]. Yet, type iii behavior presently remains unconfirmed. For type iv (a maximum followed by a minimumupon approaching the liquid phase), theoretical predictions are available [33][34][35][36][37], but no computer experiment data have confirmed these results yet. Most of these results for type iv behavior also show an enrichment of the high-boiling components' density profile, i.e. a single maximum. In general, type iv may also consist of a minimum followed by a maximum, but such structure has to the best of our knowledge not yet been observed. Most authors reporting type iv results raise doubts of the physical soundness of these predictions [34,36,37].

        <p>In summary, the available type iv behavior results are predicted by DGT in conjunction with different EOS (except those of Ref. [33], which are probably type ii with strong OLS). Most of these results show very large (almost infinite) density gradients dρ i dz at the interface between the maximum and the minimum. Hence, it remains questionable if the density (square) gradient theory approximations are valid for these systems, i.e. low density gradients compared to the repulsive interaction range of the particles are a requirement in DGT [5].In summary, the available type iv behavior results are predicted by DGT in conjunction with different EOS (except those of Ref.

        <p>The monotonicity behavior of density profiles is often characterized by the surface activity, which is a quality (not quantity) defined according to the sign of the second derivative at an extremum [31,32], i.e. a maximum in a density profile (type ii) is considered 'positive surface activity' and a minimum (type iii) as 'negative surface activity', and a monotonous density profile (type i) as 'no surface activity'. In this context, type iv may be considered as 'ambivalent surface activity'. Furthermore, the surface excess can be characterized according to visual impressions from MD or MC simulation snapshots.

        <p>The relative adsorption Γ can be used more rigorously than the 'surface activity' to quantify the surface excess. It quantifies the number of adsorbed molecules per unit area at the interface. In contrast to the enrichment and the surface activity, the relative adsorption is an integral measure for the interfacial composition. Hence, the relative adsorption does not quantify the monotonicity behavior of the density profiles (which is at times mistakenly supposed). However, the relative adsorption is influenced by the monotonicity behavior of the density profiles. The picture of the 'adsorption' being an integral measure for the interphase composition is prestressed in Gibbsian thermodynamics, which relates the integral interphase composition to thermodynamic potentials [5,55,56]. The Gibbs adsorption equation establishes a direct link between macroscopic observables and the (nanoscopic) relative adsorption at the interface: it relates the relative adsorption Γ (j) i (adsorption of a component i with respect to a component j) to the dependency of the surface tension on the chemical potential [55]. The relative adsorption Γ (j) i is thereby defined asThe relative adsorption Γ can be used more rigorously than the 'surface activity' to quantify the surface excess.

The Gibbs adsorption equation establishes a direct link between macroscopic observables and the (nanoscopic) relative adsorption at the interface: it relates the relative adsorption Γ (j) i (adsorption of a component i with respect to a component j) to the dependency of the surface tension on the chemical potential [55]. The relative adsorption Γ (j) i is thereby defined as</p>
        <p>where γ is the surface tension and μ i is the chemical potential of component i in the equilibrated phases. Accordingly, using the term 'adsorption' to characterize the non-monotonicity behavior of density profiles is in general misleading. The relative adsorption Γ (j) i can be determined experimentally (indirectly) from surface tension data in combination with a thermodynamic model for the chemical potentialsfollowing Eq. ( 2).where γ is the surface tension and μ i is the chemical potential of component i in the equilibrated phases.

The relative adsorption Γ (j) i can be determined experimentally (indirectly) from surface tension data in combination with a thermodynamic model for the chemical potentialsfollowing Eq. ( 2).</p>
        <p>As suggested above, the relative adsorption Γ (j) i can be calculated from macroscopic properties or the nanoscopic density profiles ρ i (z) [57]. The nanoscopic definition for the relative adsorption is computed as an integral measure from the density profiles ρ i (z). Thereby, the relative adsorption Γ (j) i can be obtained using a symmetric interface segregation [20,43]As suggested above, the relative adsorption Γ (j) i can be calculated from macroscopic properties or the nanoscopic density profiles ρ i (z) [57].

        <p>Results for the relative adsorption computed from the macroscopic route (Eq. 2) and the nanoscopic route (Eq. 3) are usually found to be in good agreement [19,31,32,43,52,[58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66]. This suggests that the predicted density profiles (including an eventually present non-monotonicity) correspond to physical observables. Nevertheless, the monotonicity behavior of the density profiles (cf. Fig. 1) predicted from theory and molecular simulations including the enrichment E 2 has not yet been experimentally confirmed. We note in passing that the OLS will usually have no significant contribution to the relative adsorption.Results for the relative adsorption computed from the macroscopic route (Eq. 2) and the nanoscopic route (Eq. 3) are usually found to be in good agreement [19,31,32,43,52,[58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66].

        <p>For a binary mixture, a (positive) adsorption of a component i will in general be accompanied by a desorption (negative adsorption) of component j and vice versa [15,60]. The relative adsorption is related to the monotonicity behavior of the density profiles, but not in a unique way. Relative adsorption (positive or negative) according Eq. ( 3) can be caused by two mechanisms: a relative shift of the two component density profiles and a non-monotonicity of a profile. For type i behavior, such a shift is schematically depicted in Fig. 1(a). A relative shift of density profiles can in general also appear for the other types and cause relative adsorption of a component, cf. Refs. [15,40,50,52]. The shift is not depicted for type ii-iv to avoid visual clutter.For a binary mixture, a (positive) adsorption of a component i will in general be accompanied by a desorption (negative adsorption) of component j and vice versa [15,60].

        <p>For positive surface activity, an increasing peak height of the density profile for component i will in general increase the relative adsorption Γ (j) i (cf. Fig. 1b). For negative surface activity, an increasing depletion depth of the density profile of component i would in general decrease the relative adsorption Γ (j) i (cf. Fig. 1c). For an ambivalent surface activity (cf. Fig. 1d), the impact of a relative shift of the density profiles and the peak hights can have different effects on the relative adsorptiondepending on the details of the interfacial structure.For positive surface activity, an increasing peak height of the density profile for component i will in general increase the relative adsorption Γ (j) i (cf.

        <p>Hence, depending on the two features of the density profiles (relative shift and monotonicity), positive, negative, or zero relative adsorption of a component i can be observed for different monotonicity types (cf. Fig. 1): type i behavior (no surface activity; cf. Fig. 1) with positive relative adsorption of the low-boiling component has been observed for ideal mixtures (in the sense of Raoult's law) [15,38,51]. Furthermore, type i behavior with either positive, negative or zero relative adsorption (depending on temperature and composition) of a low-boiling component has been observed for high-boiling azeotropic mixtures [15,40,51]. Type ii behavior (positive surface activity) with positive relative adsorption of the low-boiling component at all state points is frequently observed in mixtures with a supercritical component [19,31,32,38,52,54,59,[61][62][63][64][67][68][69][70] and mixtures with wide-boiling phase behavior (both components being subcritical) [60,71,72].

        <p>As an exemplaric system of the type alkane + alcohol, which could potentially exhibit a type iv behavior, the mixture cyclohexane + nbutanol was studied in this work using density gradient theory (DGT) in combination with different equations of state (EOS) as well as molecular dynamics simulation. For the molecular simulations, classical direct VLE simulations in the NVT ensemble were performed with 6 000 molecules using the pcff+ all atom force field [74,75] and the LAMMPS code [76]. Equilibration was carried out for 5 ns and the production time was 50 ns. The time step was 1 fs. Further simulation details are given in the Supplementary Material.

[77][78][79][80][81][82] We employed the stabilized density gradient theory (sDGT) method proposed by Mu et al. [83].

        <p>Mixtures with low-boiling azeotropic behavior are mostly reported to exhibit an enrichment of the low-boiling component in the respective two-phase region [15,20,40,49,50], i.e. type ii behavior (cf.

        <p>In a wide composition range, the density profiles of both components exhibit extreme (almost infinite) gradients at the interfaceespecially the cyclohexane profiles between the maximum and the minimum. These gradients are problematic for the theory, as DGT is known to be only valid in the limit of small gradients. This type of stability problem for alkane + alcohol mixtures using DGT has also been reported in conjunction with several other EOS and critically discussed in the literature [34,36,37]. Also the CPA and PC-SAFT results (see Supplementary Material) show such extreme gradients. Only at infinite dilution in the vicinity of both pure components, the density profiles of both components exhibit moderate gradients, cf. Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the DGT results obtained from the different molecularbased EOS at x ′ cyc = 0.5 mol mol -1 . All DGT results predict type iv interfacial structure. Mejía et al. used the HR-SAFT EOS with DGT for the same mixture and state point and also found a type iv behavior. Cornelisse [36] studied the mixtures hexane + ethanol and hexane + propanol using the Peng-Robinson EOS and the APACT EOS with DGT also finding type iv behavior. Mairhofer and Gross [34] studied hexane + different alcohols using PCP-SAFT with DGT and also found type iv behavior. Hence, the maximum/minimum structure is probably not a result of a defect in a chosen EOS. However, it should be noted, that the results obtained from the CPA EOS exhibit more moderate gradients than the other EOS employed in this work.

        <p>Starting at pure butanol, upon increasing the cyclohexane mole fraction in the liquid phase, the relative adsorption predicted by DGT is first positive (cyclohexane adsorbs at the interface), exhibits a zero crossing, and is then negative (cyclohexane desorbs at the interface). From the MD results shown in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the two component density profiles are shifted with respect to each other. Both the slight enrichment of cyclohexane, but in particular the density profile shift, contribute to a positive relative adsorption of cyclohexane, cf. Fig. 6.

        <p>The concentration at which there is a minimum surface tension and zero relative adsorption is referred to as aneotropic point [87]. Low-boiling azeotropic mixtures often exhibit aneotropic behavior [15,49,51,88]. Usually, the aneotropic point is found to be in good agreement with the azeotropic point [15,40,51,88]. However, for the binary mixture cyclohexane + butanol, DGT yields an aneotropic point at approximately x ′ cyc ≈ 0.3 mol mol -1 (at 303.15 K), which is far off the Experimental surface tension data for the mixture cyclohexane + butanol is scarce [89]. From that data [89], the aneotropic composition can not be reliably estimated. Mairhofer and Gross [34] studied the mixture n-hexane + ethanol (exhibiting a similar phase behavior as cycohexane + butanol) using DGT (and DFT) with the PCP-SAFT free energy model. For 298.15 K, DGT results of Mairhofer and Gross [34] also show an aneotropic point, which does not coincide with the azeotropic point at that temperature [34,37,89]. For the mixture n-hexane + ethanol, experimental surface tension data is available, which does not exhibit an aneotropic point (within the uncertainty of the data) [34,89] on the contrary to the DGT predictions [34]. The DFT surface tension predictions are, on the other hand, in accordance with the experimentally observed behavior.

        <p>The interfacial thickness (cf. Fig. 6-bottom) was computed using the 10-90% definition [90]. The interfacial thickness of the low-boiling pure component cyclohexane is larger than that of pure butanol at 303.15 K. With increasing cyclohexane concentration, DGT predicts a monotonous increase of the interfacial thickness. This is in agreement with the MD results. It is well known that MD results often show larger interfacial thickness due to surface fluctuations present in the dynamic method, which is also found in this work. The DGT results moreover predict a large plateau in a wide composition range. This plateau is a result of the extreme gradients of the density profiles at the interface. This is supported by the fact that the plateau is more pronounced in the SAFT-VR Mie and PC-SAFT results compared to the CPA results.
