        <p>The CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) dataset provides a high-resolution, monthly grid of land-based (excluding Antarctica) observations going back to 1901 and consists of ten observed and derived variables (Table 1 introduces their acronyms and other relevant information). There are no missing values in the defined domain. Individual station series are anomalised using their 1961-1990 observations, then gridded to a 0.5° regular grid using angular distance weighting (ADW); the resulting anomaly grids are converted to actuals (actual values, ie, not anomalies) for publication using the CRU CL v1.0 climatologies 1 .The CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) dataset provides a high-resolution, monthly grid of land-based (excluding Antarctica) observations going back to 1901 and consists of ten observed and derived variables (Table 1 introduces their acronyms and other relevant information).

        <p>CRU TS was first published in 2000 2 , using ADW (angular-distance weighting) to interpolate anomalies of monthly observations onto a 0.5° grid over land surfaces (excluding Antarctica) for seven variables (Table 2). The selection of ADW as the interpolation method was made after extensive evaluation of alternatives [2, section 2b]. Updates in 2004 3 , 2005 4 and yearly from 2006 to present 5 increased the variable count to ten (Table 2), and switched to triangulation (utilising IDL functions including TRIGRID and TRIANGULATE) to effect the interpolation and perform much of the synthetic variable work (remaining code was in Fortran). Synthesised observations were interpolated onto a coarser grid (2.5°, regular) and used to 'plug gaps' in the observed coverage. An extensive account of these processes may be found in references 2 and 5 , particularly with respect to filling in gaps in coverage.CRU TS was first published in 2000 2 , using ADW (angular-distance weighting) to interpolate anomalies of monthly observations onto a 0.5° grid over land surfaces (excluding Antarctica) for seven variables (Table 2).

        <p>Since the first release in 2000, CRU TS has been used widely by many classes of user, in diverse research areas and applications. These include those with localised weather-and climate-dependent models (for example, river catchment 6 , agronomic 7 ), those calibrating paleoclimate reconstructions 8,9 , those analysing climate variability 10 , and those needing bias correction for global 11 and regional climate models 12 and reanalyses 13 . Away from the sphere of climate research, users include the civil engineering 14 , financial 15 and insurance 16 sectors.Since the first release in 2000, CRU TS has been used widely by many classes of user, in diverse research areas and applications.

        <p>This version seeks to implement a more streamlined process, with ADW improving interpolation efficiency and accuracy, and delivering a full suite of metadata to facilitate nuanced interpretation of the gridded values and full traceability where necessary for quality control. This has been enabled by the move to a fully bespoke process, implemented in Fortran and described in the 'Methods' and 'Data Records' sections of this paper.

        <p>Monthly land station observations for seven variables (Mean, Minimum and Maximum Temperatures, Precipitation, Vapour Pressure, Wet Days and Cloud Cover) are updated regularly from several principal monthly sources: CLIMAT messages, exchanged internationally between WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) countries, obtained as quality-controlled files via the UK Met Office; MCDW (Monthly Climatic Data for the World) summaries, obtained from the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via its National Climate Data Centre (NCDC); and updates of minimum and maximum temperatures for Australia, obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). In addition, ad-hoc collections of stations are incorporated (after quality control checks including location, correspondence to existing holdings, and outlier checking). These observations serve to provide six 'databases' of monthly values (Diurnal Temperature Range being calculated from Minimum and Maximum Temperatures). Coverage for selected variables at selected dates is shown for precipitation in Fig. 1 and for temperature, DTR and vapour pressure in the three figures of Supplementary File 1, and discussed further in the 'Meteorological station database updating' subsection of 'Methods' . Figure 2 shows the overall process by which these observations, along with various static repositories, are used to derive each version of the CRU TS data set. Further variables are derived from these, including Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), which is required by many users in the agricultural and hydrological sectors.Monthly land station observations for seven variables (Mean, Minimum and Maximum Temperatures, Precipitation, Vapour Pressure, Wet Days and Cloud Cover) are updated regularly from several principal monthly sources: CLIMAT messages, exchanged internationally between WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) countries, obtained as quality-controlled files via the UK Met Office; MCDW (Monthly Climatic Data for the World) summaries, obtained from the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) via its National Climate Data Centre (NCDC); and updates of minimum and maximum temperatures for Australia, obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM).

        <p>Because of the overriding objective to present complete coverage of land surfaces (excluding Antarctica) from 1901 onwards, CRU TS is not necessarily an appropriate tool for assessing or monitoring global and regional climate change trends. Nevertheless, with care taken to identify and avoid trend artefacts caused by changing data coverage or data inhomogeneities, then CRU TS can be used for global and regional trend analysis. The first issue is that unlike, for example, 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>, regions uninformed by observations are not left missing but instead are replaced by the published climatology 1 . This has the advantage of being a known entity, rather than an estimate, but has the unavoidable side effect of decreasing variance. Additionally, the numbers and locations of stations contributing to any grid cell will change over time. Both effects can potentially give rise to trend artefacts. This is a particular problem with high-resolution grids, if individual grid cells or small groups of grid cells are analysed without checking to see if they contain any observation stations at all, or whether they are interpolated from distant stations during one part of the record and from close stations during another period. However, the metadata provided with the CRU TS version 4 dataset enables users to understand the level of support behind each grid cell and time step, permitting informed detection of trends or masking of areas so that analysis of trends can focus on well-observed regions. Temperature, in particular, has been shown to be resilient to the problems described above: this is in part due to its long correlation decay distance (CDD) of 1200 km (Supplementary File 1). Precipitation, with its much shorter CDD of 450 km, has reduced and more time-dependent coverage (Fig. 1), and 32 and evaluation of potential evapotranspiration equations 36 . Note 3: Also used in many areas, including dendroclimatology 37 and health 38 . Note 4: Used to calculate scPDSI for monitoring drought 39 , and in areas including regional agronomic production 40 and river basin vegetation 41 . Note 5: minimum and maximum temperatures are the monthly means of the individual daily minimum and maximum temperatures; they are not the overall minimum or maximum temperature recorded in each month.

        <p>so subject to these problems unless the data are masked prior to analysis. The second issue is that no extra homogenization is performed on the observations, so artefacts could be present where the originators have not already homogenized their data. Comparisons with other observation-based datasets at a global scale (GPCC 17 , UDEL 18 , 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs> 19 , and regional or third-party exercises [20][21][22] ) demonstrate the robustness of the dataset at large spatial scales. Assessment of the grids is discussed further in the 'Technical Validation' section of this paper.

        <p>Meteorological station database updating. The process to update the databases with observations, and to derive the DTR database, is unchanged and is described in 5 . Holdings of observations vary by variable, with spatial and temporal concerns affecting cover. In Fig. 1, and in Supplementary File 1 (three figures), the left column shows station locations in different decades: valid observations with at least 75% in a decade (ie, 90 or more monthly observations) are required for inclusion here. The right columns show the resultant gridded cover, taking into account the correlation decay distances (CDDs) of the variables: again, interpolated data for a minimum of 75% of the decade (90 or more values) are needed for a grid cell to be shaded. CDDs for CRU TS variables were established 2 . Figure 1 shows PRE station cover for 1910 -19, 1940-49, 1970-79 and 2000-09. There are far more PRE stations than for any other variable, but its CDD is the lowest (450 km), and so regions with sparse support have patchy coverage. The PRE database has been evaluated against other precipitation station collections in 23 . In Fig. 2 CRU TS production process. Colours show construction routes for each variable (see Table 1 for details of the variables).Meteorological station database updating.

        <p>Anomalies. The first stage of the process is to convert each station series into anomalies. The mean used to construct the anomalies is based on the period 1961-1990, and a minimum of 75% of observations must be present in this period (23 months or more) for each of the 12 months to be processed. Outlying values exceeding a threshold (±3 standard deviations, SD, for TMP; +4 SD for PRE) are omitted. This outlier-threshold check for TMP is more stringent than that for 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>
            <rs type="version">4.6</rs>, which uses a ±5 SD outlier check 24 . In total the ±3 SD check removes 8.6% of the TMP values. For regions where anomalies were exceptional (&gt;3 SD) this can potentially remove correct values. Of the 8.6%, 8.4% and 0.2% were respectively negative and positive extremes. Although the outlier checks are strong, this does not adversely affect the later, broad comparisons discussed in the 'Technical

        <p>The synthetic estimates are obtained using empirical relationships with the primary variables that are unchanged from those described in 5 . What has changed in CRU TS4 is that the synthetic estimates are now calculated from the primary variable station observations rather than from the primary variable gridded values. Two advantages of this change are that (1) it is more transparent which stations have contributed to the gridded values (those with observations of the secondary variable and those with observations of the primary variable(s) needed to obtain the synthetic estimates); and (2) the interpolation of the synthetic estimates can now use the CDD of the secondary variable in deciding the distance weighting. Previously, some synthetic estimates were derived from gridded primary variables that had themselves been interpolated using the CDD of the primary variable (hence less transparent, and information from further afield than the secondary variable's CDD would have been used). One result of this is that the coverage (the regions where the variable is not simply filled in by its climatological values) of the secondary variables is less complete than previously. However, this reduction in coverage arises from removing potentially low quality estimates that were previously made from too-distant observations. Synthetic VAP production. Synthetic VAP observations are generated from TMP and DTR station anomalies (or from TMP station anomalies and gridded DTR anomalies where the station data does not include TMN and TMX), as well as the published CRU climatologies for TMP and VAP 1 . While the process broadly follows that described in 5 , synthetic anomalies are now produced at a station level, rather than as gridded data, because this better suits the interpolation process as explained above. The VAP process is shown in Fig. 3, and the impact of the inclusion of synthetic VAP on the final gridded coverage is illustrated in Supplementary File 1 (p4).The synthetic estimates are obtained using empirical relationships with the primary variables that are unchanged from those described in 5 .

        <p>Synthetic WET production. The WET variable represents counts of wet days defined as having ≥0.1 mm of precipitation (section 2.4.1 of 5 ). Figure 4 shows the process by which synthetic WET values are incorporated into production of the WET product. The empirical algorithm that synthesizes WET uses PRE observations, together with normals (the CRU CL 1961-1990 climatologies 1 ) for PRE and WET. Therefore, the PRE anomalies at a station level are converted to absolute values using the PRE normal from the enclosing gridcells, and then used in the synthesis. The absolute synthetic WET values produced go to create a synthetic WET database; this is then anomalised in the same way as the observed WET database, and both sets of anomalies are passed to the interpolation algorithm. Some users use WET, and as rain day counts are part of the monthly messages we access, they are straightforward to add to the databases.Synthetic WET production.

        <p>Interpolation. General approach. The interpolation process implements angular-distance weighting (ADW) and is shown in Fig. 5. The station influence lookup tables produced as part of the anomaly process (described in the ' Anomalies' subsection of 'Methods') are used to allocate station anomalies to an array of gridcells that, for each monthly time step and cell, stores the nearest eight or fewer anomalies lying within the relevant CDD. Once the observed anomalies have been allocated, and if a secondary variable is being processed, synthetic anomalies are then allocated in the same way. However, they are excluded if within 25 km of either an observed anomaly, another synthetic anomaly, or the centre of the target cell; and if they lie within a 45° subtended angle of an observed anomaly. Additionally, they cannot replace an observed anomaly: the maximum of eight anomalies applies throughout. Once all allocations have been made, distance and (angular) separation weights are calculated (section 2b of 2 ), and used to obtain an interpolated anomaly value for each gridcell. Any land cells without allocated anomalies are set to zero, representing the climatology in anomaly space. Elevation is not specifically included in the interpolation; it is introduced via the climatologies when the gridded anomalies are converted to absolute values ('Production of absolutes' in 'Data records'). Results of a cross-validation exercise to quantify the accuracy of the ADW interpolation scheme are reported in the 'Technical validation' section.Interpolation. General approach.

        <p>, where d is the distance of the station, CDD is the correlation decay distance of the variable, and m = 4 (a value arrived at after extensive sensitivity testing reported in 2 ). However, the function was only used as part of the ADW process, when weighting more than one station to achieve an interpolated value. This resulted in unrealistic artefacts in the interpolated field. To address this, there was a need for the interpolated anomaly -or, for a single station, its anomaly -to be damped using distance-weighting as well, and a cross-validation exercise was conducted. This involved the reconstruction of every observed anomaly from every station in the process, provided at least one other station was available to interpolate from. These reconstructions were made for two basic decay functions, the original:, where d is the distance of the station, CDD is the correlation decay distance of the variable, and m = 4 (a value arrived at after extensive sensitivity testing reported in 2 ).

The interpolation process applied the selected function at all stages: the decay of a lone station anomaly with distance, the relative distance weighting in the ADW calculation, and the decay of the ADW-derived anomaly with distance. Errors were calculated as mean absolute error (MAE) for various regions, including latitude bands and 5° × 5° gridcells, as well as global values. In all cases, either Eq. ( 1) with m = 8 or Eq.( 2) with n = 1 gave the smallest errors as a global picture: PRE was served equally by both, while TMP was served better by Eq. ( 2). However, this sine curve does not allow a gradual decay at close distances, resulting in unrealistic artifacts as before. Further calculations showed that increasing the power in the sine function introduced little extra error, and a value of n = 4 was selected as a compromise between the need for accuracy in the gridcells and the need to reduce or eliminate unrealistic artifacts in the field to provide a continuous surface.In both cases, the power m or n ranged in integer steps from 1 to 8.

This explains much of the design of the variable production process: TMN and TMX are consistent with TMP and DTR because they are derived from them (DTR having been previously derived from TMN and TMX observations); VAP is consistent with the temperature variables inasmuch as synthetic VAP is derived from them; similarly, the synthetic parts of WET and CLD are consistent with, respectively, PRE and DTR; and FRS and PET are entirely consistent with other variables, being wholly derived from them. Figure 6 shows the consistency relationships.One of the benefits of a multivariate dataset is the opportunity to present, at a point in space and time, a set of variable values that are (to an extent) internally consistent.

        <p>Homogeneity. As described in 5 , and in the 'Production of primary variables' subsection of 'Methods' , CRU TS is not specifically homogeneous. Some National Meteorological Agencies (NMAs) homogenize their station observations, either before release or at a later stage (requiring a re-release). Therefore, many CRU TS observations have been homogenized (and also quality controlled) within each country. However, performing additional homogenization on the CRU TS databases would be complicated and not completely possible because of elements of the process, such as partly synthetic variables and the use of published climatologies. Sparse data coverage in some regions, or for some variables, is a particular limitation for applying neighbour-based homogeneity tests, as noted by 4 , where a degree of homogenization was implemented. The multivariate nature of CRU TS means that homogeneities identified in, for example, mean temperature data, are likely to influence other variables as well.Homogeneity.

        <p>Comparisons with other datasets can be used to identify any large inhomogeneities that might be present in CRU TS v4. For example, partial homogeneity assessment and correction was undertaken for an earlier version (v2.1) of CRU TS 4 and at large spatial scales and for most country averages there is close agreement between CRU TS versions with and without this additional homogenization. Other, single-variable datasets perform various homogeneity assessments on their observations, though even here there are difficulties because of reporting delays 17 . The 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>
            <rs type="version">4.6</rs> temperature dataset incorporates homogeneity as a result of previous work and work by originating bodies [24, section 2.2]. CRU TS v4 TMP is compared with 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>
            <rs type="version">4.6</rs> in the 'Technical validation' section and Fig. 7. These various inter-dataset comparisons do not indicate that there any large inhomogeneities present in the CRU TS v4 dataset, unless they are also present in the comparison datasets despite these other data being subject to further homogeneity checks.

        <p>Comparisons between versions and with alternative datasets. When CRU TS v4 was introduced, CRU TS v3 continued to be produced in parallel, to allow users to investigate how the move would affect their work.

        <p>At a global scale, there are very few datasets available for comparison. For TMP, The University of Delaware's 0.5° dataset 18 has been used, along with CRU's CRUTEM dataset 19 and the reanalysis dataset JRA-55 from JMA 28 . For PRE, DWD's GPCC 17 was chosen for its high observation count. TMP comparisons (Fig. 7) show good high-frequency agreement of CRU TS with 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>
            <rs type="version">4.6</rs> (correlation coefficient, r = 0.99 globally), UDEL (r = 0.97 globally) and JRA-55 (r = 0.99 globally, 1958-2017 only). However, the long-term trends in global and hemispheric land temperature are notably stronger in 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>
            <rs type="version">4.6</rs> than in UDEL: the CRU TS trend lies between them but closer to 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs>
            <rs type="version">4.6</rs>. This is clear in the difference plot ('CRUTS-UDEL'), with CRU TS being warmer than UDEL in the early Twentieth Century, and cooler more recently. Comparisons between 
            <rs type="software">CRUTEM</rs> and other global temperature datasets (as reported, e.g., by 29 ) support the reliability of the long-term

The high-frequency r for Global is 0.92, though CRU TS is drier in the early Twentieth Century, perhaps due to having lower observation counts and reduced coverage.

        <p>In general, comparison with reanalysis products is not appropriate as a way to validate observation-based datasets. Reanalyses are forecast models constrained by some observed variables. Precipitation, for example, is not usually assimilated. There are many examples of gridded observations being used to 'bias correct' reanalyses, a selection that used CRU TS are described in 30,31 , and 13 . CRU TS is also used as independent assessment of other datasets, such as satellite-derived data for recent decades 32 , highlighting the continuing need for a dataset based only on in-situ direct observations.In general, comparison with reanalysis products is not appropriate as a way to validate observation-based datasets.

        <p>A separate suite of skill testing programs use station cross validation 33 to assess the skill of the interpolation algorithm and to provide a quantitative guide to the expected accuracy of the individual interpolated values. Cross-validation could not have been performed before the move to ADW and is one of the motivations for changing to ADW. Figure 9 shows spatial maps of correlation coefficients (r) (a) and (MAE) (b) for TMP stations, with the respective distributions in (c) and (d).

All three figures include distribution graphs for r and MAE: these should be consulted for a global overview of performance.

        <p>The majority of interpolated monthly temperature anomalies are highly correlated (in 95% of cases, r is &gt;=0.56) with their withheld validation data and mean absolute errors mostly lie between 0.25 and 0.75 °C (MAE is &lt;=0.87 in 95% of cases).

        <p>The cross-validation for the interpolated monthly precipitation anomalies shows a broader range of outcomes, consistent with the shorted CDD for this variable, but still overwhelmingly dominated by positive cross-validation correlations (95% are &gt;=0.38). The mode of the distribution of MAE lies just below a 30% relative error, with 95% of MAE &lt;=66.81%. Most of the large relative errors for PRE are in very dry regions, such as the edges of the Sahara and other deserts, and will likely be small in absolute terms. The cross-validation gives correlations above 0.8 for the regions with dense networks. It is more common to find correlation around 0.5 or lower in the regions with sparse data, though it is likely (due to cancellation of the random component of errors) that correlations for seasonal, annual and decadal mean values would be greater than for the monthly values shown here.The cross-validation for the interpolated monthly precipitation anomalies shows a broader range of outcomes, consistent with the shorted CDD for this variable, but still overwhelmingly dominated by positive cross-validation correlations (95% are &gt;=0.38).

        <p>Many users have made their own attempts at validation of CRU TS, usually for particular variables (TMP, PRE, DTR). These range from comparison with other, regional data sources (eg. 20,21,34 ), to global intercomparisons (eg. 22,35 ), using either in situ, satellite-based or reanalysis-based data sources. These independent evaluations, of which there are many others, are expected to continue for CRU TS v4.

        <p>The NetCDF-formatted output files of CRU TS data may be read with any NetCDF tools; they are CF-1.4 compliant. Files for all variables except PET contain two data variables, the named one, (i.e., 'tmp'), and a station count ('stn') giving the number of stations used to build each datum. These two variables have identical dimensions. The ASCII text-formatted output files, where the 'stn' data are in accompanying files, may be read programmatically. The 'stn' data may be used to quantify uncertainty, most particularly by excluding cells with a 0 (zero) count, as these will have been set to the default climatology. Other sources of uncertainty, particularly those associated with the observations themselves, cannot be quantified in the same way: representativeness varies from variable to variable, and we are dealing with monthly means (or totals) rather than daily or sub-daily measurements. The cross-validation exercises summarised in the previous section can give some confidence in the interpolation process itself, but as with all such metadata, it is for the user to decide on boundaries to uncertainty for their particular application.The NetCDF-formatted output files of CRU TS data may be read with any NetCDF tools; they are CF-1.4 compliant.

        <p>The CRU TS dataset was developed and has been subsequently updated, improved and maintained with support from a number of funders, principally the UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the US Department of Energy. Long-term support is currently provided by the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS), a NERC collaborative centre. The UDel_AirT_Precip data used in the comparisons plots of Fig. 7 was provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their web site at https://www. esrl.noaa.gov/psd/. The JRA-55 reanalysis mean temperature dataset used in the comparisons plots of Fig. 7 was from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) project carried out by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), accessed at UCAR: https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds628.0/. The JRA-55 reanalysis was chosen as it is 20 years longer than the latest one from ECMWF (ERA5), meaning that a 1961-1990 average can be simply calculated.The CRU TS dataset was developed and has been subsequently updated, improved and maintained with support from a number of funders, principally the UK's Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the US Department of Energy.
