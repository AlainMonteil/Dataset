        <p>Belite cements (BCs) could be a more sustainable binder than Portland cements (PCs) but adequate knowledge of the hydration features has still to be built. In particular, the mild curing hydration temperature effects have been extensively studied for PCs but not for BCs. This research was triggered by a previous work reporting improved mechanical strengths of BCs at higher curing temperatures. Here, we report the hydration characteristics of a BC at 20, 40 and 60ºC and compared to those of a PC. We have corroborated previous findings and used a multi-technique approach including Rietveld phase analysis, thermal analysis, calorimetry, silicon MAS-NMR, mercury intrusion porosimetry and chiefly synchrotron X-ray microtomography, to thoroughly understand the different behavior. In a nutshell, the improved mechanical performances at mild curing temperatures for BCs are mainly due to a much larger belite degree of reaction, with lower porosity coarsening of belite cements also playing a roleBelite cements (BCs) could be a more sustainable binder than Portland cements (PCs) but adequate knowledge of the hydration features has still to be built.

        <p>Portland cements (PCs) world production is ∼4 Gt/yr [1], being the main component for the fabrication of concretes [2], concrete likewise being the most used material after fresh water. In spite of its ubiquitous current usage, PC is a very environmentally contentious material. On average, for every ton of Portland clinker produced, 0.87 CO2 tones are emitted to our atmosphere [3], that includes emissions from limestone decomposition and burning fuel. This translates into ∼7% of the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions [4]. Furthermore, its production releases gases and particles causing health damages [5]. There is a clear need to produce more sustainable concretes [6] with lower embodied carbon content and one way is to use cements with lower CO2 and harmful gas footprints. However, it has been already identified that cement production is one of the most difficult industrial processes to decarbonize [7], hence modest advances are expected. One approach to (modestly but safely) reducing the CO2 footprint of cements is to use active belite cements [4,8,9] where its environmental impact has been very recently estimated and compared to those of PCs and related alternative cement systems [10]. Belite cements and its activation have been very recently reviewed [11].Portland cements (PCs) world production is ∼4 Gt/yr [1], being the main component for the fabrication of concretes [2], concrete likewise being the most used material after fresh water.

        <p>PCs are fabricated from clinker, obtained at ~1500 °C, by grinding with the setting regulator (i.e. calcium sulfates). A typical grey Portland clinker mineralogical composition is close to 65 wt% of C3S (alite), 10 wt% of C2S (belite), 15 wt% of C4AF, 5 wt% of C3A and ~5 wt% of other minor content phases, and hereafter the cement nomenclature [2] is followed for referring to the mineralogical phases. Belite cements (BCs) generally contain the same components but the amount of alite and belite are reversed. There are five motivation drivers for using BCs: (i) lower limestone demand with lower associated CO2 emissions, ~8 %; (ii) slightly lower energy demand as the enthalpy of formation for alite and belite are -2931 and -2308 kJ/mol, respectively [10]; (iii) lower maximum kiln operating temperature, ∼1300°C, which means additional lowering gas emissions from burning and less demanding kiln liner maintenance; (iv) lower temperature increase at early hydration age and chemical shrinkage which minimizes thermal cracking; and (v) last but not least, longer service life, due to the relatively larger fraction of C-S-H gel, the main hydration product of alite or belite, per unit volume of binder. However, there is currently one showstopper and two drawbacks for its general adoption. The showstopper is the lower reactivity of ordinary belite at room temperature with water, which results in slow early-age strength developments not meeting current standards. The drawbacks are the requirements of: i) more grinding energy; and ii) higher cooling velocities, which could result in slightly higher energy demand and higher investment. This work was triggered by a previous report [12] where the compressive mechanical strength as a function of time and temperature for PCs and BCs were compared. It was reported that the compressive strength for a BC mortar at 28 days of hydration increased from 58 to 74 MPa, i.e. +28%, when the temperature raised from 20 to 70 ºC [12]. The corresponding values for a reference PC mortar declined from 58 to 46 MPa, or -21%. This tantalizing result was backed by an earlier investigation from the same authors [13]. This means that there is a conspicuous difference between BCs and PCs hydration behavior with temperature and its mechanistic explanation, including the microstructural differences, merited further research.PCs are fabricated from clinker, obtained at ~1500 °C, by grinding with the setting regulator (i.e. calcium sulfates).

        <p>Relatively high temperatures in concretes may take place because of hot/warm weather, undissipated heat of hydration in large volumes, elevated temperature curing (e.g. steam), or a mix of these circumstances. The consequences of elevated temperatures in PC based concretes have been widely researched. The detrimental consequences of curing temperature on the mechanical strengths of PCs is known since more than 50 years [14]. The agreed main explanation for the observed behavior is a more heterogeneous distribution of hydration products leading to a coarser pore microstructure [15] with chemistry changes, like an evolution of ettringite towards AFm, also likely playing a role. This research showed that as temperature increases, there was a significant decrease in C-S-H bound water content and an increase of its apparent density [15]. A subsequent study focused on the density, Ca/Si (C/S) ratio and water/silicate (H/S) ratio in C-S-H gel with temperature [16]. It was concluded that: i) the density varied from 1.90 to 2.10 g/cm 3 ; ii) the molar C/S ratio evolved from 1.90 to 1.71; and the H/S ratio changed from 5.1 to 2.7; when curing from 7 to 90 ºC, respectively. The main results being independently confirmed soon after by using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry [17]. The increase in C-S-H mass density and its lower bounded water explains its more microporous nature which in turn contributes to justify the poorer mechanical performances of PC mortars and concretes at higher curing temperatures.Relatively high temperatures in concretes may take place because of hot/warm weather, undissipated heat of hydration in large volumes, elevated temperature curing (e.g. steam), or a mix of these circumstances.

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, there is not report addressing the chemistry and microstructural changes with mild curing temperature in belite cements. Furthermore, although X-ray tomography is being widely used for cement-based materials [18][19][20], it has not been applied for studying the microstructural changes with curing temperature for PCs and BCs based binders. Hence, the goal of this investigation is to reproduce an earlier report indicating an increase of compressive mechanical strengths with temperature for belite cements, contrary to the well-known Portland cement behavior. Once/if confirmed, a detailed comparative study is carried out to have insights on the different behaviors by employing several techniques including high-resolution synchrotron X-ray microtomography.To the best of our knowledge, there is not report addressing the chemistry and microstructural changes with mild curing temperature in belite cements.

        <p>Pastes were prepared with a w/c (water-to-cement) mass constant ratio of 0.50. They were mechanically stirred for 90 s at 800 rpm, with 30 s pause, followed by another 90 s stirring at 800 rpm, to improve their homogeneity. Then, the pastes were poured into hermetically closed cylinders of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and rotated during the first 24h (16 rpm) at the selected temperature, 20ºC, 40ºC or 60ºC. Subsequently, cylinders were taken out and samples were kept submerged in water at the target temperature. At the selected ages, the hydration of the cement pastes was arrested. In order to do so, samples were manually ground, filtrated in a Whatman system and washed twice with isopropanol, and once with diethyl ether.Pastes were prepared with a w/c (water-to-cement) mass constant ratio of 0.50.

            <rs type="software">EXPGUI</rs> graphic interface [22]. Final global optimized parameters were: background coefficients, zero-shift error, cell parameters, and peak shape parameters using a pseudo-Voigt function. The preferred orientation effect was observed for portlandite in the pastes and it was corrected by the March-Dollase approach [23]. The pastes were mixed with 20 wt% of quartz as an internal standard. The ACn (amorphous and crystalline non-determined) content was determined by the internal standard methodology [24]. This quartz was purchased from Alfa Aesar, 99.5% of purity, and it was sieved &lt;125 μm, prior to the mixing. Its particle size distribution data are: dv,10=1.0 µm, dv,50=2.7 µm and dv,90=6.6 µm.

        <p>. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements for the pastes were performed in a SDT-Q600 analyzer from TA instruments (New Castle, DE). Two data sets were taken for every paste, a neat one and another for the hydration-arrested specimen. The temperature was varied from RT to 1000°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Measurements were made in open platinum crucibles under synthetic air flow. The weighed loss from RT to 550 °C was assigned as chemically bounded water and the weighed loss from 550 to1000 °C was considered as CO2. It is noted that the bound water content is slightly underestimated as the water released by the C-S-H gel above 550 ºC is not computed. These cements have limestone and hence it not straightforward to disentangle the two origins for the mass loss above 550ºC..

        <p>Pore entry size distributions were measured on cylindrical samples of dimensions: 1 cm of diameter and 1.5 cm of height. Two pieces of each paste were independently measured and the reported data are the average of the two traces which were very similar. The pastes were cured for 28 days following the procedure already described. Before MIP measurements, the hydration was arrested by sinking the pieces in isopropanol for 3 days. Then, the pastes were dried by gentle heating at 40ºC up to constant weight, which took about 5 days. In order to measure porosity in the range from 1 mm down to 4 nm (radius), a micromeritics AutoPore IV 9500 porosimeter (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross -GA, US) was used. The pressure applied by the intrusion porosimeter ranged from 0 to 206 MPa in step mode. A constant contact angle of 140° was assumed for data evaluation [26].

Microtomographic measurements were performed at the TOMCAT beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland. All samples/capillaries were scanned with a monochromatic X-ray energy of 15 keV with a sample-to-detector distance of 5.5 mm, to obtain high contrast images. The image detector is composed of a 20-µm thick LuAG:Ce scintillator, a diffraction limited microscope optics, 20× objective, and a high-resolution CCD camera (pco.edge 5.5, PCO AG, Germany). The employed experimental setup resulted in an isotropic pixel size of 0.325 µm and a field of view of 0.8×0.7 mm (V×H), just large enough to image the full width of the capillaries, 0.5 mm of diameter (H). The exposure time for each frame was 200 ms. For each tomographic dataset, 1501 projections over 180º sample rotation were acquired which resulted in a total scan time of 5 min per sample for this highresolution configuration. Phase retrieval of the projections was performed using the Paganin algorithm [27] and then tomographic reconstruction was carried out [28]. For each acquired tomogram, two full reconstructions were obtained with and without applying the Paganin algorithm.

For the segmentation of the main components, a large Volume of Interest (VOI) of ~1×10 8 μm 3 size was selected for each sample. The Paganin reconstructed data were not post processed by denoising neither smoothing. The cylinder shape mask aligned for each dataset was chosen to leave out the capillary walls. The manual selection of the threshold values was carried out based on the shape of the greyscale histograms to differentiate between the three main components: i) porosity (air and water); ii) hydration products; and iii) unhydrated cement phases. There were valleys in the hydration products/unhydrated cement phases contributions and the thresholds were positioned in the valleys. For the pores/hydration products segmentation, and the absence of valleys between these contributions, the threshold choices were based on the shape of the greyscale voxel distribution, tangent-slope approach, see section 3.8.1 for more details. It is acknowledged that the manual histogram shape-based threshold choice may slightly affect the accuracy of the results of the segmentation.

        <p>Both cements were analyzed by LXRPD and XRF. Rietveld quantitative phase analyses and elemental analyses are reported in Tables S1 andS2, respectively. The textural properties are as important as the phase contents to interpret the reactivities. Therefore, a thorough textural characterization was carried out. Air permeabilities (Blaine values) were 369 and 502 m 2 kg -1 for PC and BC, respectively. Fine milling of BCs is needed to enhance belite reactivity. Accordingly, the BET surface areas were 1.20(1) and 1.40(1) m 2 g -1 . The PSDs are displayed in Fig. S1 with dv,50 being 19.5 and 7.5 µm for PC and BC, respectively. Finally, average densities were 3.13 and 3.17 g.cm -3 for PC and BC, respectively. The belite cement was employed in a previous study under oil well curing conditions and its textural properties were reported [29] but they are also given here for easy access to the information.Both cements were analyzed by LXRPD and XRF.

        <p>The mechanical strength results are displayed in Fig. 1. At room temperature (panels a and d), the mechanical strengths increase with hydration time as expected, the PC values being higher than those of BC up to 3 months. As previously reported, for instance in [30,31], BC compressive strength surpassed that of PC above 100 days. A small drop in flexural strengths at later ages has been observed, see Fig. 1(d), which was not within the scope of this research and it deserves further investigation, if this behavior is confirmed.The mechanical strength results are displayed in Fig. 1.

        <p>As discussed in the introduction, the compressive and flexural strengths for PC stagnate and even decrease as hydration temperature increases. At 2 days of hydration, compressive and flexural strengths slightly increase at 40ºC and then slightly decrease at 60ºC, see Fig. 1b ande. This pattern is more evident at 28 days where the values decreases at 40 ºC and more pronounced at 60 ºC, see Fig. 1c andf. Conversely, the compressive strengths of BC at 2 and 28 days increase with temperature at 40 and even 60 ºC, see Fig. 1b andc. A similar behavior is displayed by the flexural strengths at 2 days, see Fig. 1e, although a slight decrease is observed at 28 days and 60ºC, see Fig. 1f. We speculate that the slight increase in the compressive strength for BC mortar at 28 days and 60ºC, accompanied by a decrease of the flexural strength, indicates that flexural strengths are much more sensitive to the pore coarsening that it takes place at this temperature, see below. However, the mechanistic understanding of this requires further investigation. In any case, the previous results [12,13] concerning compressive strengths are reproduced here, for a relatively different BC, where the compressive strengths increase +27% from 20 to 60ºC at 28 days for the BC mortar, meanwhile, and decrease -17% from 20 to 60ºC at 28 days for the PC mortar. It must be noted that the compressive strength differences at 28 days between the PC and BC mortars were +11, -5 and -13 MPa, for 20, 40 and 60 ºC, respectively, see Fig. 1c. The remaining part of this paper is to report the findings on the hydration of BC at mild curing temperatures to help in the understanding of the different behaviors.As discussed in the introduction, the compressive and flexural strengths for PC stagnate and even decrease as hydration temperature increases.

        <p>The PC hydration behavior is fully in line with previous reports [15,16] where the main evolution with temperature was the destabilization of ettringite (AFt) and the formation of small amounts of calcium aluminate monosulfate (AFm) and katoite, mainly at 60ºC. On the other hand, BC presents a very interesting hydration behavior with temperature. It can be clearly seen that the hydration degree of belite at 28 days and 40 ºC is much larger than that at 20 ºC. This reaction degree further increases at 60ºC, see the right panel in Fig. 2. Additionally, and as expected, AFt decomposes and a much lower amount is observed at higher curing temperatures. This is accompanied by just a minor increase in the AFm content. All LXRPD data have been analyzed by the Rietveld method, as described in the experimental section, in order to obtain the quantitative phase analyses (RQPA). The eighteen Rietveld plots, at every hydration time and temperature, are deposited in the Supplementary Information, Figs S2-S7.The PC hydration behavior is fully in line with previous reports [15,16] where the main evolution with temperature was the destabilization of ettringite (AFt) and the formation of small amounts of calcium aluminate monosulfate (AFm) and katoite, mainly at 60ºC.

        <p>The resulting phase contents are summarized in Tables 1 and2, for PC and BC pastes, respectively. The hydration degrees increased with time and temperature, as expected. For PC at 20ºC and 28 days, the reaction degree of C3S and C2S were 86 and 31%, respectively. At the same hydration time but at 40ºC, these values increased to 89 and 56%, respectively. Interestingly, at 60ºC, the hydration degree of C3S stagnates at 88% but that of C2S kept growing up to 71%. For BC at 20ºC and 28 days, the reaction degree of C3S and C2S were 85 and 54%, respectively. At 40ºC, these values augmented to 87 and 78%, respectively. Very interestingly, at 60ºC, the hydration degrees of C3S and C2S were 87 and 88%, respectively. It must be noted that at this temperature and hydration time, the reaction degree of belite is the same than that of alite within the errors of the measurements. The reaction degrees of tricalcium aluminate and tetracalcium aluminoferrate did not significantly change with temperature. Therefore, they are not further discussed here. The noticeable increase in the reactivity of belite with temperature (partly) explains the increase of compressive strengths showed by the belite cements. It must be noted that the higher reaction degree of C2S at 20ºC and 28 days for BC, 54%, is higher than that of belite in PC in the same conditions, 31%, very likely because BC is ground to a finer value than PC, see subsection 3.1 above. It is also highlighted here that the quantitative data reported in Tables 1 and2 were obtained for pastes and the mechanical strengths reported in Fig. 1 were determined for mortars. The possible (minor) impact of the sand in the early age hydration kinetics has not been studied by powder diffraction.The resulting phase contents are summarized in Tables 1 and2, for PC and BC pastes, respectively.

        <p>Concerning the hydrated phases, several observations deserved discussion. Firstly, and as previously reported [15,16,33], AFt contents decreased with temperature in both cement pastes, see Tables 1 and2. However, at the same time, the crystalline AFm contents increased very little. Therefore, we concluded that the overall amorphous content, ACn, should contain a significant contribution from amorphous AFt/AFm at higher temperature or alternatively the liberated aluminum could be incorporated in the gel resulting in the formation of C-(A)-S-H. Secondly, there is not a crystalline iron-containing hydrated phase. Therefore, the hydration of C4AF is assumed to yield amorphous Aland Fe-siliceous hydrogarnet as previously reported [34]. This amorphous component is also included within our overall ACn content. Thirdly, katoite contents changed little and hence, their evolutions are not discussed here. Fourthly, the portlandite contents evolved as expected. For PC pastes at 28 days, the CH contents were 13.0, 13.4 and 11.6 wt% at 20, 40 and 60ºC, respectively. The corresponding values for BC were 4.3, 5.4 and 5.2 wt%, respectively. The portlandite contents increased at 40ºC because of the larger hydration degree of belite (and of alite but not at much lower extension). On the other hand, their contents decreased from 40 to 60ºC by 13 and 4% for PC and BC, respectively. This decrease is likely due to the reaction of portlandite with hydration phases like ettringite but further investigations are needed to firmly establish this point. Finally, it is noted that preferred orientation for CH was observed in the PC pastes but not in the BC ones. The March-Dollase preferred orientation correction values were 1.10-1.12, 1.12-1.14 and 1. It is important to determine if the RQPA given in Tables 1 and2 are close to the expected values based on the hydration reactions. We focus this comparison on C-S-H gel and portlandite as they are key components of the hydrated binder. The chemical reactions yielding C-S-H gel and portlandite are (3) and (4) [35]. Additionally, reaction (5) gives the reaction of belite and C4AF to yield amorphous siliceous hydrogarnet and crystalline portlandite [36,37]. The reaction ( 6) is used in the case that all the C2S has been consumed in reaction (5) and there is some C4AF left.Concerning the hydrated phases, several observations deserved discussion.

        <p>Ca3SiO5 + 5.2 H2O → (CaO)1.8SiO2(H2O)4.0 (am.) + 1.2Ca(OH)2 (cryst.) From these hydration reactions, it is possible to calculate the expected portlandite and C-S-H contents. An example of this calculation is given in the Supplementary Information. The results are given in Table 3. As an example (PC-20ºC-28d), if the average Ca/Si ratio for C-S-H is assumed to be 1.70 instead of 1.80, the resulting theoretical CH content would be 12.6 wt% instead of 11.8 wt%. It can be seen that for Portlandite contents, the measured values by diffraction and thermal analysis, see below, are quite close to the expected values from the hydration of the cement phases in PC pastes at the three temperatures. Conversely, for BC pastes the measured values are significantly lower than the expected one. We partly justify this disagreement by the approximate nature of the used chemical reactions as for instance the Ca/Si ration in the C-S-H gel of belite binders could be higher leading to less crystalline portlandite. Additionally, BC contains 1.3 wt% of ye'elimite that hydrates with calcium sulphate to yield ettringite and ~0.7 wt% of nano-gibbsite, Al(OH)3 gel. Al(OH)3 is not stable in a portlandite rich environment and it could react helping to account for the disagreement between the expected and measured amounts of CH in the hydration of this BC. Furthermore, the final end of this aluminum is not clear as crystalline stratlingite is not detected. It could be possible that this aluminum is incorporated in C-S-H gel yielding an Al-richer C-(A)-S-H. Aluminum is known to modify the C-S-H chemical nature and precipitation rate [38,39]. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that C2S hydration degree strongly depends upon the aluminum environment [40]. Clearly, further research is needed to address the Al-role and the portlandite content disagreement. On the other hand, the comparison of the expected and indirectly measured C-S-H contents are better for BC than for PC pastes, see Table 3. In any case, taken into account the number of approximations carried out for these comparisons, the overall agreement is considered satisfactory and the trends are fully captured. 3.4. Thermal analysis study. Fig. 3 displayed a compilation of the thermal analysis traces for all studied pastes (non-arrested hydration samples). The individual thermal analysis patterns for the eighteen samples are given in supplementary information, Figs. S8 to S13. The portlandite contents derived from these analyses, using the tangential method, are in full agreement with the values given above from the Rietveld quantitative phase analyses. The slight decrease in CH contents at 60 ºC for PC pastes are fully reproduced here. The larger CH content with temperature for BCs, due to the increased belite reactivity, is also evident through this technique, see Fig. 3. Furthermore, minor amounts of calcium carbonate are evident in the thermal traces, weight losses close to 650 ºC, which are coming mainly from the employed cements, see mineralogical compositions in the supporting information.Ca3SiO5 + 5.2 H2O → (CaO)1.8SiO2(H2O)4.0 (am.) + 1.2Ca(OH)2 (cryst.)

        <p>Free water contents were calculated as described in the experimental section and they were reported in Tables 1 and2. In agreement with the advance of the hydration reactions, the FW decreases with the hydration time at every temperature. Importantly, and in agreement with previous publications [15][16][17], the FW content for the PC paste at 60ºC and 28 days, ~18 wt%, is larger than those obtained at 20 and 40ºC, ~15 wt%, despite the hydration degree being even slightly larger. This is fully compatible with denser C-S-H gel with lower highly-retained gel pore water content and hence, developing a larger fraction of capillary water. Even more importantly, as this is a totally novel result, the FW content for the BC pastes at 60ºC and 28 days, ~15 wt%, is only marginally larger than those shown at 20 and 40 ºC, ~14 wt%. Therefore, the coarsening of C-S-H gel with temperature for BC is much less important than that exhibited by PC which also helps to explain that BC showed better mechanical strength performances at relatively higher temperatures, see section 3.2 above.

        <p>3.5. Calorimetric study. Fig. 4 displays the calorimetric study for the PC and BC pastes. The first peak in PC is due to alite hydration with a shoulder at a higher hydration time due to the aluminate hydration contribution. For BC, the first peak has two contributions, alite hydration and ye'elimite reaction to yield ettringite. As expected, the hydration of PC is accelerated at early ages by temperature and the maxima in the heat flow curve were measured at 11.0, 4.6 and 4.0 hours for 20, 40 and 60ºC, respectively. For BC cement paste, alite and ye'elimite hydrations are also accelerated by increasing temperature and the maxima took place at 17.4, 3.8 and 3.2 hours for 20, 40 and 60ºC, respectively. The cumulative heat developed for PC pastes at 7 days and 20, 40 and 60ºC were 310, 328 and 330 J/g, respectively, see Fig. 4 (b). Hence, an increase of 6.5% in the overall heat is measured when compared the data at 20 with 60ºC. The corresponding values for BC pastes were 211, 230 and 231 J/g, see Fig. 4 (d). Therefore, an increase of 9.5% in the cumulative heat is observed from 20 and 60ºC. It is noteworthy that the increase in reactivity for both types of cement, as detected by calorimetry, took place mainly from 20 to 40ºC. The traces at 40 and 60ºC being closer for the PC and almost identical for the BC.3.5. Calorimetric study. Fig. 4 displays the calorimetric study for the PC and BC pastes.

        <p>Two additional observations can be highlighted. Firstly, PC and BC display nearly identical mechanical strength performances at 2 days and 60ºC, see Fig. 1. However, PC developed 311.1 J/g, meanwhile, BC released 189.4 J/g (or 39% less heat). This behavior reflects the lower hydration heat of belite and its activated reactivity at mild temperatures. Secondly, the hydration heats at 2 days of BC at 40 and 60ºC are very similar, 187.9 and 189.4 J/g, respectively. However, the mechanical strengths (both compressive and flexural) are much higher at 60ºC, see Fig. 1 panels (b) and (e). This behavior is not captured by the cumulative heat, due to the low hydration heat of belite, but evidenced in the Rietveld quantitative study as the belite hydration degree at 2 days and at 40 and 60ºC are 13 and 34%, respectively, see Table 2. These results emphasize the importance of a multi technique approach.Two additional observations can be highlighted. Firstly, PC and BC display nearly identical mechanical strength performances at 2 days and 60ºC, see Fig. 1. However, PC developed 311.1 J/g, meanwhile, BC released 189.4 J/g (or 39% less heat). This behavior reflects the lower hydration heat of belite and its activated reactivity at mild temperatures. Secondly, the hydration heats at 2 days of BC at 40 and 60ºC are very similar, 187.9 and 189.4 J/g, respectively. However, the mechanical strengths (both compressive and flexural) are much higher at 60ºC, see Fig. 1 panels (b) and (e). This behavior is not captured by the cumulative heat, due to the low hydration heat of belite, but evidenced in the Rietveld quantitative study as the belite hydration degree at 2 days and at 40 and 60ºC are 13 and 34%, respectively, see Table 2.

        <p>Finally, it is noted that the calorimetric characterization, as well as thermal analysis and powder diffraction, is carried out for pastes but they are related to the mechanical strength developments of mortars. Therefore, calorimetric measurements were also carried out at 40 and 60ºC for the mortars to determine if the sand significantly modifies the paste hydration kinetics, see Fig. 4. On the one hand and as previously reported [41], the kinetics at early ages are slightly enhanced for mortars, before the main heat flow peak, very likely due to the different shearing conditions when mechanically dispersing the suspensions. On the other hand, the overall heat developed at 7 days is always slightly smaller for the mortars than for the corresponding pastes. This was also expected as the nominal w/c ratio of pastes and mortars were identical but the sand adsorbs a small amount of water and hence, the effective w/c ratio in mortars, i.e. available for cement hydration, is slightly lower. In any case, the reported results show that the sand does not importantly modify the Tdependent behavior previously discussed for the PC and BC pastes. 3.6. 29 Si MAS-NMR study. The BC and PC pastes hydrated at 28 days and at 20ºC and 60ºC were also studied by 29 Si MAS-NMR. Fig. 5 shows the spectra and their deconvolutions in single components. The signals observed at approximately -79 and -85 ppm are attributed to the Q 1 and Q 2 Si units, respectively. Moreover, the presence of the band situated around -82 ppm is assigned to Q 2 (1Al) [42,43]. Q 1 is associated with silicate end chain units and Q 2 indicates the presence of silicate in intermediate chain positions. Therefore, larger Q 2 relative intensities directly mean larger average silicate chains. Additionally, Q 2 (1Al) units represent mid-chain groups in which one of the adjacent tetrahedra contained aluminum. Depending on the case, the silicate mean chain length (MCL) can be determined from the expression, MCL=2(Q 1 +Q 2 )/Q 1 or MCL=2(Q 1 +Q 2 +(3/2)Q 2 (1Al))/Q 1 [42]. The MCL values for the PC and BC pastes cured at 20ºC are quite close, 3.05 and 2.96, respectively. At 60ºC, these values increase up to 4.22 and 4.62 for PC and BC, respectively. This shows that the degree of the silicate polymerization in the C-S-H gel increases at high temperatures which is in agreement with previous publications for PC [44,45]. Table S3 gives the areas for the bands that were used to determine the MCL values just reported. Finally, and in agreement with the RQPA study shown above, the reaction degree of the calcium silicate phases increased with the curing temperature as the Q 0 band intensities were lower at higher temperatures. This behavior is more pronounced for belite in BC pastes.Finally, it is noted that the calorimetric characterization, as well as thermal analysis and powder diffraction, is carried out for pastes but they are related to the mechanical strength developments of mortars.

        <p>The pore size distributions and cumulative porosities of cement pastes cured at selected temperatures for 28 days are shown in Fig. 6. As mercury only intrudes the connected porosity, MIP data really represent pore entry size distributions. This results in an underestimation of the volume of the biggest pores as only a fraction is accessible through smaller ones, known as ink-bottle effect. This feature makes the direct comparison of MIP data with results from other techniques difficult. In any case, the evolution within a given series and the comparison between series is quite informative.The pore size distributions and cumulative porosities of cement pastes cured at selected temperatures for 28 days are shown in Fig. 6.

        <p>The critical pore entry radii for PC pastes slightly evolve with temperature (from ~65 to 40 nm). Moreover, the pore size distribution is wider at 60 ºC which could reflect the pore coarsening with increasing hydrating temperature [15]. This is highlighted with arrows in Fig. 6 (a) and (b). The most conspicuous result from this study is the smaller critical pore entry sizes of BC pastes, see Fig. 6 (c), when compared to those of PC. The critical pore entry sizes for BC also slightly narrows from 20 to 40ºC, from ~30 to 20 nm, due to the increased degree of reaction. This result is in agreement with the RQPA and TA observations reported above, see Table 1.

        <p>It is worth noting that the overall MIP-measured porosity fraction for PC pastes, see Fig. 6(b), changes very little with temperature. Conversely, the overall porosity for BC pastes very significantly decreases from 20 to 40ºC, which is in full agreement with the enhanced degree of reaction of belite reported in Table 2. Finally, our MIP study did not reproduce the previously reported finding [16] which showed a significantly larger critical pore entry size at 60ºC.It is worth noting that the overall MIP-measured porosity fraction for PC pastes, see Fig. 6(b), changes very little with temperature.

        <p>The microstructures of the pastes, without specimen alteration due to sample preparation, have also been studied by synchrotron X-ray microtomography. We benefit from the coherence properties of the synchrotron X-rays by placing the detector 5.5 mm far from the sample which resulted in the edge enhancement also known as Xray phase-contrast [27] but without several fringes that it could jeopardize the quantitative analysis. From a single propagation-based tomographic data acquisition, two data sets were reconstructed: (i) without Paganin algorithm applied (hereafter, absorption data) and (ii) with Paganin algorithm applied (hereafter, Paganin data) [27]. Fig. 7 displays selected tomographic slices showing glass capillary cross sections (Paganin data) for the PC pastes hydrated at 20, 40 and 60ºC for 28 days. For the sake of comparison, the same tomographic slice (absorption data) for PC hydrated at 20ºC is also shown. In both reconstructions, the anhydrous cement particles (highly absorbing) are whiter and the porous regions (air and water) are darker, the hydrated phases having intermediate grey values. However, it can also be seen that the image contrast (information) in the reconstructed tomograms with Paganin algorithm applied is larger than that present in the amplitude data sets as the differences in gray values of the different components are wider. Fig. 7 also displays similar tomographic slices for the BC pastes. Tomographic data were also taken with hydration time at 20ºC and they are shown in Supplementary Information.

        <p>In order to illustrate the high spatial resolution nature of the acquired data, Fig. 8 displays an enlarged view of the highlighted region shown in Fig. 7f. It can be seen that a capillary pore of size close to 2 µm is readily measured. Furthermore, the plot profile shown in Fig. 8 allows to follow the three main components in the studied pastes in the Paganin tomograms: i) porosity (water and air) with grey values ~10000; ii) hydrated components, ~21000-25000; and unhydrated cement particles, ~38000-43000.In order to illustrate the high spatial resolution nature of the acquired data, Fig. 8 displays an enlarged view of the highlighted region shown in Fig. 7f.

        <p>A first data analysis can be carried out by inspecting the greyscale histograms (GSHs). For the employed algorithms, the linear attenuation coefficient µ is mapped in the reconstructed tomograms, where the higher is the µ value, the whiter is the corresponding greyscale value. If the chemical stoichiometries and mass densities are known, the µ value can be calculated for the used wavelength [46]. These data are listed in Table 4 and help to understand the observed evolutions in the GSHs. Fig. 9 displays the normalized GSHs (number of voxels corresponding to a given greyscale value divided by the total number of voxels of the analyzed Volume of Interest, VOI) for the pastes cured at 20ºC with increasing hydration time. The VOIs were as large as the mapped cylindrical samples but without incorporating the glass capillaries. As the images are reconstructed in 16-bits, the GSHs spans from 0 to 65535 integer values. For the absorption tomograms, see Fig. 9b and9d, it can be seen that the anhydrous component phases are located close to 40000 greyscale values for both types of pastes. The hydrated phases are the main components with greyscale values close to 34000 with a relatively broad distribution reflecting the three main constituents: C-S-H gel, portlandite and ettringite. The water-filled pores cannot be distinguished from the air-filled regions and their greyscale values are similar and lower than ~30000.A first data analysis can be carried out by inspecting the greyscale histograms (GSHs).

        <p>It is worth noting that as expected, the center of the hydrated components for PC has a larger greyscale value, 34500, than that of the BC pastes, 33300, see Fig. 9b and9d. This is due to BC pastes containing lower amounts of portlandite, which has the largest attenuation within the hydrated components. Furthermore, hydration kinetics of BCs is slower than that of PCs and this is reflected in the narrowing of the hydrated phase distribution in BC pastes with time, see Fig. 9d. Moreover, the relative amounts of anhydrous components decreased with time as the hydration reaction progressed. Finally, the very narrow band centered as 29500 (in the absorption reconstruction) is due to the large empty volumes (bubbles, cracks from shrinkage, etc.), see Fig. 9b.It is worth noting that as expected, the center of the hydrated components for PC has a larger greyscale value, 34500, than that of the BC pastes, 33300, see Fig. 9b and9d.

        <p>Figs. 9 (a) and (c) displays the GSHs for the Paganin data for PC and BC pastes, respectively. The advantages can be clearly seen in these datasets, when compared to the absorption ones, as the separation between the components is much wider. Specifically, the greyscale difference between the anhydrous and hydrated components is larger. Moreover, the porous volumes and void regions now have very low greyscale values close to 10000-12000. This significantly helps in the segmentation stage. It is worth noting that the widths of the hydrated component band for PC pastes did not significantly evolve with hydration time, see Fig. 9 (a), being close to 6500 grey values. Conversely, the hydrated bands for BC pastes sharpened with time, from 8000 to 6000 grey values, see Fig. # Mass density at the microscale for water saturated nanocrystalline C-S-H gel is taken from [47].Figs. 9 (a) and (c) displays the GSHs for the Paganin data for PC and BC pastes, respectively.

        <p>For selecting the greyscale threshold, and in the absence of clear valleys between the contributions, the tangent-slope approach, of the histograms, was used [48].

Firstly, the centers of the hydrated component bands kept approximately constant for PC pastes with temperature close to 34700 grey value, see Fig. 10(b). Conversely, the position of the centers for BC pastes evolves with temperature from ~33300 to ~34500. We justify this increase in the overall X-ray absorption of BC hydrated components because the decomposition of AFt and mainly the larger fraction of portlandite formed at higher temperature which was observed from RQPA, see results in Table 2.Fig. 10 displays the GSHs for the pastes cured for 28 days at mild temperature for VOI leaving out the big pores.

        <p>Secondly and importantly, the width of the GSH for the hydrate components in PC markedly increases at 60 ºC, see Fig. 10(a), by about ~40%. This is in line with the reported coarsening of C-S-H gel where the density of C-S-H gel increases likely due to the conversion of gel pore water to capillary water [15][16][17]. This increase in the heterogeneity of the C-S-H is shown in the 60ºC histogram as a broader distribution. Thirdly and importantly, this behavior is not that markedly shown by the BC pastes with temperature, see Fig. 10(c), where the width increase at 60ºC, is ~20%. This result is in agreement with much lower increase of free water, see Table 2, with temperature for BC pastes. Hence, C-S-H gel coarsening with temperature for BC pastes is significantly less important than for PC ones, which contribute to explain that the mechanical properties of belite mortars cured at higher temperatures are comparatively better than those shown by PC mortars. The comparative temperature behavior is the key output of this study. Therefore, the tomographic results at higher temperatures were repeated in two sets of capillaries independently prepared: one set sealed with grease, see Fig. 10, and the other set sealed by melting the tip of the glass capillaries at high temperatures, see Fig. S16. For this additional set of tomographic studies, the width increase from 20 to 60 ºC for PC pastes was ~45%, see Fig. S16 (a). The analogous study for BC pastes yielded a width increase of ~30%, see Fig. S16 (c). Hence, this different behavior has been firmly established.Secondly and importantly, the width of the GSH for the hydrate components in PC markedly increases at 60 ºC, see Fig. 10(a), by about ~40%.

        <p>Furthermore, reproducibility is always a concern and even more importantly in techniques under development like high-resolution synchrotron X-ray microtomography. Therefore, one repeat for each BC hydrating time paste was also acquired from capillaries filled independently.

        <p>All recorded Paganin tomograms were segmented by manual thresholding using 
            <rs type="software">Dragonfly</rs> software. The thresholds for the component assignment were derived from the GSH shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Specifically, for PC pastes any voxel with a grey value larger than 34500 was labelled as unhydrated cement product (UHP). Voxels with grey values lower than 17000 were labelled as pores. Consequently, the remaining voxels (grey values between 17000 and 34500) were classified as hydrated products (HP). A small amount of calcium carbonate is also accounted within HP component because its X-ray absorption is situated in this range, see Table 4.

        <p>Several observations can be drawn from the data reported in Table 5 and partly visualized in Fig. 11. Firstly, the porosity changed quite significantly from one capillary to another. This is likely due to problems with the efficient filling of such narrow capillaries. In some cases, large voids with dimensions larger than 100 µm were observed. Furthermore, for some capillaries (but not for all) porosity is concentrated close to the glass capillary walls, see Fig. 11(b). We speculate that this is mainly due to the lack of compaction during the filling of the capillaries with a possible small contribution of chemical shrinking. More research is needed to investigate this behavior by microtomography [49]. As porosity contribution was quite random, Table 5 also reports the segmented values but renormalized just taken into account the hydrated products and the unhydrated cement fraction described as rHP and rUHP, respectively. From the repeats, it can be stated that the reproducibility in the segmented results was relatively poor, 4 vol%. Narrow capillaries, φ=0.5 mm, were employed to access to high resolution, as the horizontal field of view was 0.7 mm. It was already known that controlling with w/c ratio and random mineralogical phase distribution in such narrow capillaries was very challenging [50,51]. In general, the segmented amount of unhydrated cement particles, rUHP, ranged 10-20 vol%, being larger than the expected values from RQPA. For instance, the PC paste hydrated at 20ºC for 28 days should have ~9 vol% according to the RQPA and the measured value by microtomography was 14.3 vol%. Conversely, the BC paste hydrated at 20ºC for 28 days should have ~16.5 vol% according to the RQPA and the microtomographic result was 14.9 vol% (the average value of the two segmentations). Overall, there is not a satisfactory agreement between the segmented fractions by tomography and the results by RQPA. Therefore, we conclude that more robust capillary preparation procedure is needed for quantitative component analyses likely implying wider glass tubes to have accurate control of the w/c ratios and reproducible results for component segmentations at high spatial resolution. Our initial intention was to further characterize the temperature evolution of the connectivity of porosity. However, as sample preparation must be improved, it was judged that this type of studies should be carried out after suitable (and reproducible) sample preparations. Furthermore, it must be noted that the computed degree of connectivity of the pore network is very sensitive to the spatial resolution of the tomographic data [50], and hence the best possible spatial resolution should be attained, currently ∼1 µm with standard microtomography and ∼70 nm with ptychographic nanotomography [47,52]. However, it should also be taken into account that the whole range of pore sizes in the cement binders, down to ∼5 nm, cannot be accessed with this level of spatial resolution and the tomographic approach is always an approximation.Several observations can be drawn from the data reported in Table 5 and partly visualized in Fig. 11.

For instance, the PC paste hydrated at 20ºC for 28 days should have ~9 vol% according to the RQPA and the measured value by microtomography was 14.3 vol%. Conversely, the BC paste hydrated at 20ºC for 28 days should have ~16.5 vol% according to the RQPA and the microtomographic result was 14.9 vol% (the average value of the two segmentations). Overall, there is not a satisfactory agreement between the segmented fractions by tomography and the results by RQPA. Therefore, we conclude that more robust capillary preparation procedure is needed for quantitative component analyses likely implying wider glass tubes to have accurate control of the w/c ratios and reproducible results for component segmentations at high spatial resolution. Our initial intention was to further characterize the temperature evolution of the connectivity of porosity. However, as sample preparation must be improved, it was judged that this type of studies should be carried out after suitable (and reproducible) sample preparations. Furthermore, it must be noted that the computed degree of connectivity of the pore network is very sensitive to the spatial resolution of the tomographic data [50], and hence the best possible spatial resolution should be attained, currently ∼1 µm with standard microtomography and ∼70 nm with ptychographic nanotomography [47,52]. However, it should also be taken into account that the whole range of pore sizes in the cement binders, down to ∼5 nm, cannot be accessed with this level of spatial resolution and the tomographic approach is always an approximation.</p>
        <p>The mechanical strength performances of BC cements increased with curing temperature in the studied range, 20 to 60ºC. This behavior is opposite to that shown by typical PCs where mechanical strengths worsen with increasing curing temperature. The better mechanical performances at mild curing temperature for BC are explained by two findings. The largest contributing factor is the difference in the activation energies of C2S and C3S. Rietveld quantitative phases analysis has shown that belite degree of hydration at 28 days in the studied BC increased from 54% to 78%, when raising curing temperature from 20 to 40ºC. This increase in belite reactivity has been backed by thermal analysis (larger portlandite contents), calorimetry (larger heat development) and 29 Si MAS-NMR spectrometry (lower Q 0 contribution to the overall spectrum). Furthermore, it is highlighted that at 28 days of hydration of the belite cement, the hydration degrees of alite and belite were nearly identical, (i.e. 87 and 88%, respectively) when cured at 60ºC. Secondly and also playing a role, the curing at mild temperatures for the belite cement did not yield a relevant coarsening of the porosity. This result is derived from the high-resolution synchrotron X-ray microtomographic study and backed by mercury intrusion porosimetry and free water determination. Conversely, the well-known porosity coarsening in PC pastes with temperature is evidenced in the microtomographies. Additionally, the raw data for calorimetry, MIP, LXRPD, NMR and PSD are uploaded on Zenodo in text file or excel format. Besides, the thermal analysis files can be open using the
