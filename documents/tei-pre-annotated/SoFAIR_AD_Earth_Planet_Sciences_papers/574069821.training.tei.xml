        <p>Estimates of ocean CO 2 uptake from global ocean biogeochemistry models and pCO 2 -based data products differ substantially, especially in high latitudes and in the trend of the CO 2 uptake since 2000.

        <p>The ocean sequesters a remarkably constant fraction of about 25% of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions each year [1,2]. This is quantified in the annual releases of the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) [2] through simulations with global ocean biogeochemistry models (GOBMs) and data products based on measurements of surface ocean pCO 2 (pCO 2 -products). This fraction is consistent with interior ocean biogeochemical observation-based estimates [3], atmospheric inversions [2] and observations of atmospheric O 2 to N 2 ratios [4]. There is agreement between the data classes on a mean ocean carbon uptake of 2-2.2 PgC yr -1 in the 1990s, on a stagnation of the ocean sink in the 1990s, and a reinvigoration since the early 2000s. However, there are discrepancies in the temporal evolution of the ocean sink, in particular between the GOBMs and pCO 2 products [1,2]. The rate of increase 2000-2018 amounts to 0.41 ± 0.04 PgC yr -1 decade -1 in the GOBMs and to 0.69 ± 0.14 PgC yr -1 decade -1 in the pCO 2 products (table 1). The discrepancy grows further in time, and is a factor of three for the trend since 2010 [1,2]: The ocean sink increased by 0.9 PgC yr -1 decade -1 since 2010 according to the pCO 2 products, but only by 0.3 PgC yr -1 decade -1 according to the GOBMs [2]. The diverging trends since around 2000 stem from the Southern Ocean and the northern high latitudes [2]. The Southern Ocean also stands out as the region of largest discrepancy in the mean flux [1,2]. This discrepancy, however, lies within the uncertainty of the river flux adjustment [5] and its spatial distribution [6,7] that needs to be accounted for when comparing the pCO 2 products' flux estimate, which includes signals of carbon transport from land to ocean via rivers and associated ocean outgassing, with the GOBMs ocean sink estimate without this signal [1,2].The ocean sequesters a remarkably constant fraction of about 25% of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions each year [1,2].

        <p>Global ocean biogeochemistry models are general ocean circulation models with biogeochemical modules. They simulate the CO 2 flux at the air-sea interface and the exchange of carbon between the surface and the deep ocean, with all their seasonal, interannual and longer time-scale variations. They further include a low-to intermediately complex representation of the biological carbon cycle [8]. They are closely tied to recent climate change and variability as they are forced with atmospheric reanalysis fields, such as the Japanese 55-year atmospheric reanalysis (JRA55-do) [9]. They reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of surface ocean pCO 2 observations relatively well on large spatial and annual scales [1]. A direct comparison with ocean interior carbon accumulation 1994-2007 [3], as well as with the best estimate of the mean 1990s ocean carbon uptake as assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth Assessment Report (AR4) [10] indicates that the GOBMs underestimate the mean ocean carbon sink by 0.2-0.4 PgC yr -1 [2]. A similar underestimation of ocean carbon uptake in Earth System Models was related to model biases in surface to deep ocean carbon transport [11][12][13] and in the surface chemical buffer capacity (Revelle factor) [14,15].Global ocean biogeochemistry models are general ocean circulation models with biogeochemical modules.

        <p>Annually updated estimates of the ocean carbon sink from surface ocean pCO 2 observations have been facilitated by the advent of the quality-controlled Surface Ocean CO 2 Atlas (SOCAT) in 2011 [16,17] and its annual updates since 2015 [18]. The SOCATv2022 release contains 33.7 million pCO 2 observations with an estimated accuracy of better than 5 micro atmospheres. These Table 1. Decadal trend in the ocean carbon uptake over the period 2000-2018 in the Global Carbon Budget 2022 [2] global ocean biogeochemistry models and surface ocean pCO 2 based data products, and in the FESOM-1.4-REcoM2 version used here. The ensemble mean and standard deviation (s.d.) are also given. observations are, however, unevenly distributed in space, time and seasons ( [18], updated). They cover about 2% of all grid points in an array with monthly 1 • longitude × 1 • latitude dimensions, 1990 to present. Based on this dataset, mapping methods were developed that can fill the gaps (98%) to obtain full global coverage. The ocean CO 2 uptake can be calculated from these global maps of surface ocean pCO 2 with gas-exchange parametrizations [19,20], observation-derived wind speed data (e.g. from atmospheric reanalysis) and sea surface temperature and salinity. The first methods, based on a data-driven mixed-layer scheme, a neural network, and multi-linear regression were published in 2013/2014 [21][22][23][24] and others have followed since then [25][26][27][28]. While a first comparison of the different methods identified substantial discrepancies in terms of the amplitude of interannual variations [29], evaluation with independent data indicated that data scarcity presents a larger limitation than potential methodological weaknesses [26]. This is supported by model subsampling experiments that have revealed biases in pCO 2 products due to data scarcity [30][31][32][33]. Specifically, insufficient sampling leads to an overestimation of the global and Southern Ocean amplitude of decadal variability by 21% and 31%, respectively [31], and to a 30% overestimation of the mean flux in the Atlantic Ocean [32]. These studies, however, could not assess the confidence in the ocean carbon sink trend estimate since 2000. This is because one study [31], which is not comparable to observed atmospheric CO 2 trends in the period 2000-2018, while the other studies were confined to single ocean basins [32,33]. GOBMs were used for many years as the only data class for the ocean carbon sink estimate in the GCB. Ocean carbon sink estimates from pCO 2 products were used as an independent comparison dataset for the GOBMs since 2013 [34]. In the budget 2021, the ocean sink estimate was for the first time obtained as the average of the GOBM ensemble mean (eight GOBMs) and the pCO 2 -product ensemble mean (seven pCO 2 products) [2]. Sparsity in surface pCO 2 observations is thus one of the major sources of uncertainties for this combined ocean sink estimate, and particularly for the temporal evolution, including the trend since around 2000. Autonomous observations, e.g. from biogeochemical Argo floats (bgcArgo) [35,36] or uncrewed surface vehicles [37] may potentially close gaps in the observational network [32,33]. This is of particular interest in southern high latitudes that are less regularly accessed by ships, in particular in winter, although the lower accuracy of pCO 2 values derived from float-based pH measurements remains a major challenge [30,35,38].Annually updated estimates of the ocean carbon sink from surface ocean pCO 2 observations have been facilitated by the advent of the quality-controlled Surface Ocean CO 2 Atlas (SOCAT) in 2011 [16,17] and its annual updates since 2015 [18].

        <p>In this study, we use output from one global ocean biogeochemistry model that contributes to the Global Carbon Budget to assess the effect of data sparsity on the pCO 2 -based estimates of the ocean carbon sink. We train two mapping methods with pCO 2 and other environmental data from the GOBM, which was subsampled according to three sampling schemes (SOCAT, SOCAT plus Southern Ocean bgcArgo floats, ideal bgcArgo coverage). Comparing the resulting pCO 2 reconstructions and air-sea CO 2 fluxes to the known model truth, we assess reconstruction biases with respect to the mean flux, its variability and the magnitude of its trend 2000-2018.In this study, we use output from one global ocean biogeochemistry model that contributes to the Global Carbon Budget to assess the effect of data sparsity on the pCO 2 -based estimates of the ocean carbon sink.

        <p>We use the ocean circulation model FESOM1.4 [39] coupled to the ocean biogeochemistry model REcoM2 [1,40,41]. The unstructured mesh has 126 859 surface nodes, roughly equivalent to a 1 • × 1 • resolution. The surface nodes are unevenly distributed with the lowest resolution in the subtropics, and higher resolution at the equator, the coasts, the southern high and in particular, the northern high latitudes [39]. The model is started from initial conditions (World Ocean Atlas for nutrient fields [42], GLODAPv2 for alkalinity and preindustrial dissolved inorganic carbon [43]). It is spun up from 1850 to 1957 using repeated year atmospheric forcing, taken from the year 1961. The atmospheric forcing fields for the spin-up and for the simulation period 1958-2018 are taken from the JRA55-do Reanalysis Version 1.4.0 [9]. Further, both spin-up and simulation periods are forced with observed atmospheric xCO 2 as provided by the GCB [44], which is the average of atmospheric CO 2 measurements from the Mauna Loa and South Pole stations since 1958 [45,46]. This is converted to pCO 2 using spatiotemporally varying sea-level pressure and the water vapour correction (a function of sea surface temperature and salinity). Carbonate chemistry and air-sea CO 2 exchange are calculated with the mocsy routines [47] that apply a quadratic gasexchange parameterization [20] (see equations (2.1) and (2.2)). This is the same model version as used in the Global Carbon Budget 2020 [44] and the RECCAP project (https://reccap2-ocean. github.io).

        <p>We create three sampling masks (figure 1). The first mask is based on SOCATv2019 (gridded version) [18] and thus comparable to the current pCO 2 product submissions to the Global Carbon Budget. A second mask is created from SOCATv2019 and the bgcArgo observations of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling project (SOCCOM). The SOCCOM floats provide summer and winter data since 2014. Over the entire study period, this mask is dominated by SOCAT, and SOCCOM contributes less than a quarter of Southern Ocean In the bgcArgo panel, the white background shading in the Arctic depicts the Arctic region that is excluded from all analyses.

Notably, even though the ideal bgcArgo design aims for full global coverage, the floats do not extend into the Arctic realm following Roemmich et al. [36]. We therefore chose to not place hypothetical floats there, using the RECCAP Arctic mask (https://reccap2-ocean.github.io/), which is depicted by lighter background shading in figure 1d.

We compare the actual temporally varying data availability from SOCAT and SOCCOM to a hypothetical case with full ideal bgcArgo sampling since 1970. We do not account for movement of floats in the bgcArgo case. We also do not account for higher uncertainty of bgcArgo derived pCO 2 values.observation since 2014 (figure 2).

        <p>The mean pCO 2 over the period 2009-2018 for the original model output and the three sampling schemes is illustrated in figure 1. The difference in annual mean pCO 2 in the Southern Ocean between full model output and pCO 2 at SOCAT (and SOCAT + SOCCOM) locations can be explained by the summer bias in SOCAT (see electronic supplementary material, figures S1 and S2). The data coverage increases globally from SOCAT to SOCAT + SOCCOM to bgcArgo, except for the Arctic (by design). We therefore exclude the Arctic from our analysis, again using the RECCAP Arctic mask. The number of observations from the three data sources (SOCAT, SOCCOM, bgcArgo) is presented in figure 2. The ideal (hypothetical) bgcArgo grid provides more filled grid cells than SOCAT until 2004 in the global case, until 1994 for the North (north of 30 • N, Arctic excluded), until 2005 in the tropics (and intermittently thereafter, 30 • S to 30 • N), and always in the Southern Ocean (south of 30 • S). This picture holds throughout seasons, except in the Southern Ocean. Here, SOCAT can offer more summer grid cells covered than bgcArgo since 2006, but only about half the amount of grid cell coverage in winter (electronic supplementary material, Figures S3 andS4). Globally, coverage corresponds to 2.4% of all monthly 1 2). The data distribution in pCO 2 space also varies between the sampling schemes (figure 3). The SOCAT and SOCAT + SOCCOM sampling masks result in a skewed data distribution relative to the full FESOM-REcoM output. In particular, pCO 2 is skewed towards higher pCO 2 values before 2000 in all regions, and towards lower pCO 2 values after 2000. The latter is most pronounced in the Southern Ocean and hence also in the global mean, but also has a contribution from the north. The bgcArgo scheme captures the data distribution well throughout all time periods and regions.The mean pCO 2 over the period 2009-2018 for the original model output and the three sampling schemes is illustrated in figure 1.

        <p>The CarboScope pCO 2 interpolation (also known as Jena mixed layer scheme, Jena-MLS) is a hybrid scheme that uses a multi-linear regression model to link ocean internal carbon sources and sinks to environmental variables, and an explicit interannual correction when pCO 2 observations are available [48]. The following input fields for the regression and for the parametrizations of gas exchange and carbonate chemistry, normally taken from observation-based data sets, are replaced here by FESOM-REcoM output (interpolated from monthly to daily time-steps, and from 1 • × 1 • to 2.5 • longitude × 2 • latitude): sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, icefraction, alkalinity and mixed layer depth. Wind speed and sea-level pressure are taken from JRA55-do both in FESOM-REcoM and the standard CarboScope pCO 2 interpolation. Usually, CarboScope uses an alkalinity climatology based on sea surface salinity and temperature [50]. In our application, the time-varying FESOM-REcoM alkalinity is used. Likewise, the pCO 2 data are subsampled from the surface pCO 2 field of FESOM-REcoM. In addition, CarboScope uses a prior estimate of the decadal trend of the CO 2 flux taken from an ocean inverse model (OCIM, [51]). In an additional test case, the prior is replaced with the decadal trend of a FESOM-REcoM simulation forced by increasing atmospheric CO 2 and repeated year atmospheric forcing fields (1961, referred to as simulation C in the Global Carbon Budget and RECCAP, no climate change and variability).

The scheme thereby attempts to reconstruct the surface pCO 2 fields 1958-2019.</p>
        <p>We use two realizations of the CarboScope product. The first realization calculates the airsea CO 2 flux at the daily time-step used in CarboScope with the gas-transfer velocity from FESOM-REcoM, which was calculated at every 15 min time step and saved as monthly kw660, i.e. normalized to a Schmidt number of 660. The temperature dependence (varying Schmidt number) is taken into account based on the monthly FESOM-REcoM sea surface temperature output. CO 2 solubility is also calculated from FESOM-REcoM sea surface temperature and salinity fields. These daily CO 2 flux fields are then averaged into monthly fields. The gas-transfer velocity in FESOM-REcoM has a mean value of 14.0 cm h -1 . Atmospheric pCO 2 is also taken from FESOM-REcoM, i.e. from a globally uniform xCO 2 value converted to pCO 2 with spatiotemporally varying sea-level pressure, sea surface temperature and salinity. The second realization uses the native CarboScope gas-exchange formulation based on the quadratic wind speed dependence [52] with the transfer coefficient scaled to match a global mean transfer velocity of 16.5 cm h -1 [53] and the spatially resolved atmospheric CO 2 fields from the CarboScope atmospheric inversion [48]. The same wind fields (JRA55-do reanalysis) as in FESOM-REcoM are used. In CarboScope, the surface pCO 2 differs between the two realizations as the ocean internal sources/sinks may respond to the air-sea CO 2 flux.We use two realizations of the CarboScope product.

        <p>The MPI-SOM-FFN method uses a self-organizing map (SOM) approach to divide the global ocean into large-scale and highly dynamic biogeochemical provinces, in which pCO 2 is reconstructed with a feed-forward neural network (FFN) model, that has previously been trained with pCO 2 observations and environmental variables [49]. Here, the monthly 1 • × 1 • MPI-SOM-FFN reconstruction 1982-2018 uses chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, atmospheric CO 2 concentration and mixed layer depth as environmental variables from FESOM-REcoM model output. By training the feed-forward neural network model on pCO 2 data from the FESOM-REcoM model that is subsampled according to the experiment setup of this study, the network reconstructs a nonlinear relationship between environmental drivers and pCO 2 within each biome, that is then used to fill gaps in the sea surface pCO 2 . As for CarboScope, we use two air-sea CO 2 flux datasets for MPI-SOM-FFN that both build on the same monthly 1 • × 1 • pCO 2 fields, and on FESOM-REcoM output of atmospheric pCO 2 . Note that MPI-SOM-FFN has no feedbacks between CO 2 flux and pCO 2 , in contrast to CarboScope. Firstly, CO 2 flux is calculated with FESOM-REcoM output (kw660, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity) according to equations (2.1) and (2.2) and we thereby take into account the temperature dependency of the gas-transfer velocity as in the model equations [20,47]. Secondly, following the native MPI-SOM-FFN methodology, the air-sea CO 2 exchange is calculated with a quadratic gas-exchange velocity parametrization [52], scaled to a global mean transfer velocity k w of 16.5 cm h -1 . The solubility of CO 2 in seawater is calculated from sea surface temperature and salinity output from FESOM-REcoM and the formulation of Weiss [54]. The transfer velocity k w is calculated from ERA5 6-hourly u-and v-wind components from which the square of wind speed (i.e. U 2 ) is calculated at 6-hourly temporal resolution. The second moment wind speed is then obtained by averaging into monthly means ( U 2 ) before calculating gas-exchange according to equations (2.1) and (2.2). Additionally, the air-sea CO 2 exchange is limited to ice-free ocean areas, determined by the sea-ice fraction provided by the FESOM-REcoM model output.The MPI-SOM-FFN method uses a self-organizing map (SOM) approach to divide the global ocean into large-scale and highly dynamic biogeochemical provinces, in which pCO 2 is reconstructed with a feed-forward neural network (FFN) model, that has previously been trained with pCO 2 observations and environmental variables [49].

        <p>We primarily compare the mean CO 2 flux estimate over the last decade of the reconstructions (2009-2018, FCO 2009-2018 2 ) and the trend 2000-2018 which is calculated as a linear fit over these years. We further calculate the standard deviation and correlation coefficient of the detrended CO 2 flux time-series 1982-2018 as a measure of the amplitude and phasing of interannual variability of the large-scale fluxes [2,29], acknowledging that the so-calculated metrics also contain signals from decadal variability.We primarily compare the mean CO 2 flux estimate over the last decade of the reconstructions (2009-2018, FCO 2009-2018 2 ) and the trend 2000-2018 which is calculated as a linear fit over these years.

        <p>The results section is structured into three parts. Firstly, we analyse the air-sea CO 2 fluxes and the mismatch between pCO 2 products and known model truth based on the air-sea CO 2 fluxes calculated from mapped pCO 2 and the FESOM-REcoM gas-exchange formulation ( §3a). This is to analyse the effect of sampling distribution without interference of gas-exchange calculations. Secondly, we compare differences in reconstructed surface ocean pCO 2 ( §3b). Finally, we analyse the difference between using the ocean model's or the pCO 2 products' native gas-exchange formulation for the calculation of air-sea CO 2 flux from mapped pCO 2 ( §3c).The results section is structured into three parts.

        <p>The reconstructed global and regional CO 2 flux time-series from the three sampling experiments with the same gas-exchange calculation as in FESOM-REcoM are presented in figure 4, and the key statistics of the global CO 2 flux in figure 5. Both mapping methods overestimate the mean CO 2 uptake 2009-2018 and the trend 2000-2018 in the SOCAT sampling scheme. In the MPI-SOM-FFN method, the 12% overestimation of the mean in the SOCAT scheme is reduced to 9% in bgcArgo. The 9% overestimation in CarboScope (SOCAT) vanishes in the bgcArgo scheme (2% underestimation, figures 4 and 5). For the trend since 2000, the overestimation of 35% in the SOCAT scheme turns into a 10% underestimation with the bgcArgo scheme for MPI-SOM-FFN and the 20% overestimation to a 2% underestimation in CarboScope. Increasing data availability from SOCAT to the bgcArgo scheme hence leads to substantially improved agreement on the trend since 2000 (FESOM-REcoM: 0. ). The amplitude of variability is with 0.14 PgC yr -1 relatively well captured by MPI-SOM-FFN (SOCAT) in comparison to FESOM-REcoM (0.16 PgC yr -1 ) and is somewhat underestimated in the bgcArgo sampling scheme (0.10 PgC yr -1 ). The amplitude of variability of CarboScope turns from a slight underestimation with SOCAT sampling (0.14 PgC yr -1 ) to a good match with bgcArgo sampling (0.16 PgC yr -1 ). The CarboScope method reproduces the phasing of temporal variability, as measured by the correlation coefficient with the FESOM-REcoM annual time-series, more skilfully than MPI-SOM-FFN, and responds more strongly to higher and more evenly distributed data availability (MPI-SOM-FFN (SOCAT): 0.69, (bgcArgo): 0.83, CarboScope (SOCAT): 0.81, (bgcArgo): 0.99).The reconstructed global and regional CO 2 flux time-series from the three sampling experiments with the same gas-exchange calculation as in FESOM-REcoM are presented in figure 4, and the key statistics of the global CO 2 flux in figure 5.

        <p>A notable result is found in the Southern Ocean (figure 4). Here, the overestimation of the trend with the SOCAT sampling scheme of 50% in CarboScope and 130% in MPI-SOM-FFN is eliminated with the bgcArgo scheme (trend 2000-2018 FESOM-REcoM: 0.13 PgC yr -1 decade -1 , An improvement of the reconstructions with increased and more evenly distributed data availability also occurs in the tropics (figure 4). In the bgcArgo scheme, the mean FCO 2009-2018 2 is well captured with a slight overestimation of the ocean carbon outgassing by both products (FESOM-REcoM: -0.05 PgC yr -1 , MPI-SOM-FFN: -0.08 PgC yr -1 , CarboScope: -0.11 PgC yr -1 ). This is a substantial improvement compared with the SOCAT scheme in MPI-SOM-FFN (-0.20 PgC yr -1 ), whereas the offset is somewhat larger and of opposite sign for CarboScope in the bgcArgo sampling scheme (SOCAT, -0.02 PgC yr -1 ). The phasing of temporal variability improves in the bgcArgo scheme (correlation coefficients MPI-SOM-FFN: from 0.64 to 0.75, CarboScope: from 0.89 to 1.00). The amplitude of variability is too low in both products, but the discrepancy is eliminated in CarboScope with the bgcArgo scheme. The availability of data prior to 1990 in the bgcArgo scheme corrects a large tropical outgassing signal in CarboScope based on SOCAT (and SOCCOM, figure 4), which we relate to the very low data availability before 1990 and to the skewed SOCAT pCO 2 distribution towards higher pCO 2 (figure 3, tropics, 1982-1999).A notable result is found in the Southern Ocean (figure 4).

        <p>In the North (north of 30 • N, Arctic excluded), there is little improvement from SOCAT to ideal bgcArgo sampling for the mean CO 2 uptake and amplitude of variability (figures 4 and 5). This is because more observed grid cells have been available in SOCAT since 1995 than in bgcArgo (figure 2). The reconstructed mean flux in MPI-SOM-FFN bgcArgo scheme is 4% higher than in the FESOM-REcoM data. Interestingly, the effect of the skewed SOCAT distribution (figure 3) on the CO 2 flux in the North is small, but notable for the last 5 years and the trend in MPI-SOM-FFN. The overestimation of the trend (2000-2018) is reduced in MPI-SOM-FFN with the ideal sampling (FESOM-REcoM: 0.08 PgC yr -1 decade -1 , MPI-SOM-FFN (SOCAT): 0.14 PgC yr -1 decade -1 , MPI-SOM-FFN (bgcArgo): 0.09 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ; no change in CarboScope: 0.09 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ) and the correlation is increased for MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope (MPI-SOM-FFN: from 0.74 to 0.90, CarboScope: from 0.82 to 0.96).

        <p>The spatial patterns of the air-sea CO 2 fluxes averaged over the period 2009-2018 are very well reproduced by the MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope methods in all sampling schemes (figure 6). The only exception is anomalous outgassing in the Arctic in the bgcArgo scheme, which does not include any input data from this region. In MPI-SOM-FFN, the biases go generally into the same direction as the fluxes, i.e. fluxes into the ocean are overestimated in magnitude and fluxes out of the ocean are equally overestimated. Exceptions are a smaller outgassing signal along the west coast of South America and smaller uptake in the south Atlantic high uptake regions. A higher sampling density reduces the overestimation throughout the ocean, but reduces the overestimated outgassing more than the overestimated uptake. In CarboScope, biases are smaller but with the same patterns. However, the bias in the tropical outgassing regions is negligible, leaving the biases mostly located in high-wind CO 2 uptake regions. In the bgcArgo scheme, patches of over-and underestimation alternate. We next inspect how well surface pCO 2 is reconstructed, before investigating the role of transfer velocity in §3c.The spatial patterns of the air-sea CO 2 fluxes averaged over the period 2009-2018 are very well reproduced by the MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope methods in all sampling schemes (figure 6).

In the tropics, the pCO 2 reconstruction is improved in the bgcArgo compared with the SOCAT sampling scheme in terms of the mean pCO 2 (both products), and variability (CarboScope; figure 7). A larger positive pCO 2 bias before 1985 and a small negative bias after 2000 in CarboScope (SOCAT) vanishes in the bgcArgo case.

        <p>In the North and the South, pCO 2 is underestimated by both products in the regionally averaged time-series. In the North, the mean bias as well as a trend towards increasingly negative bias since 2005 is reduced in the bgcArgo relative to the SOCAT sampling scheme (both products). However, a bias in the mean of about -2 µatm persists in MPI-SOM-FFN and the bias varies between about -2 and +2 µatm in CarboScope. A similar result is found in the South, where the SOCAT (and SOCAT + SOCCOM) sampling scheme leads to an increasingly negative pCO 2 bias between 2002 and 2008 in MPI-SOM-FFN (from near 0 to -8 µatm), which persists thereafter. This bias in the temporal evolution vanishes with more data availability in the bgcArgo case. The SOCCOM floats do not reduce this bias, which is located mostly in the Weddell Sea and coastal regions (figure 8). The Southern Ocean mean pCO 2 bias is negative in the bgcArgo scheme, Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 07 May 2023 varying between -4 and +1 µatm in MPI-SOM-FFN and between -4 and -1 µatm in CarboScope (figure 7). The maps of the mean pCO 2 bias (figure 8) illustrate that the pCO 2 biases are only partly co-located with the CO 2 flux biases (figure 6). In fact, CarboScope pCO 2 biases (outside of the Arctic) stem mostly from the Weddell and Ross Seas and a small region in the northwest Pacific. These Southern Ocean regions are usually ice-covered and it is unlikely that pCO 2 biases in these regions lead to substantial biases in CO 2 flux. In MPI-SOM-FFN, the negative pCO 2 biases are more equally distributed in the Southern Ocean, but are also not co-located with the CO 2 flux biases (figures 6 and 8).In the North and the South, pCO 2 is underestimated by both products in the regionally averaged time-series.

        <p>In summary, we conclude from the analysis of CO 2 flux and pCO 2 biases that more and regularly spaced observations can cure or substantially reduce biases in the temporal evolution of the observation-derived CO 2 flux estimates. However, even with regular 6 • × 6 • sampling schemes, a discrepancy in the mean CO 2 flux between FESOM-REcoM and MPI-SOM-FFN persists in the Southern Ocean, which suggests a methodological origin (figure 4). The pCO 2 comparison (figures 7 and 8) suggests that the generally larger CO 2 flux in the pCO 2 products with near perfect sampling (bgcArgo) may be related to a persistent underestimation of pCO 2 , but with an additional imprint of high wind speed regions. The comparisons so far were conducted with the reconstructed pCO 2 fields and a consistent use of the gas-exchange calculation as in FESOM-REcoM. Next, we investigate additional discrepancies in the mean CO 2 flux, when using the method's native gas-exchange calculations.In summary, we conclude from the analysis of CO 2 flux and pCO 2 biases that more and regularly spaced observations can cure or substantially reduce biases in the temporal evolution of the observation-derived CO 2 flux estimates.

        <p>In addition to artefacts due to skewed data distribution, choices in gas-exchange calculations contribute to discrepancies between air-sea CO 2 fluxes from mapping methods and from the ocean biogeochemistry model. The difference between air-sea CO 2 flux calculated with FESOM-REcoM gas transfer velocity (as used for figures 4-6) and the MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope native gas-exchange calculation is not only substantial in magnitude, but also increases over time and affects the amplitude of interannual variations (figure 9). For example, the difference between the two gas-exchange calculations nearly doubles between 1982 and 2018 from 0.18 PgC yr -1 to 0.34 PgC yr -1 for the global flux in MPI-SOM-FFN, with roughly equal contributions from the North and South. The air-sea CO 2 flux in the tropics is hardly affected. Similarly, the discrepancy between the two ways to calculate gas-exchange increases by more than a factor of five from 0.07 PgC yr -1 to 0.42 PgC yr -1 for the global flux in CarboScope. Here, the offset is larger in the North (0.13 PgC yr -1 ) than in the South (0.06 PgC yr -1 ) at the beginning of the time-series in 1958, but reaches similar levels towards the end of the time-series (around 0.22 PgC yr -1 ). Note that the native gas-exchange experiment with CarboScope was conducted with a climatological FESOM prior rather than the OCIM prior, but the difference related to the choice of prior is small in the ideal sampling case (compare green and grey dotted lines in figure 9). Choice of prior affects mostly the period before 1990 in the SOCAT and SOCAT + SOCCOM sampling cases (see electronic supplementary material, figure S6). As a result, the amplitude of interannual variations is enlarged with the product's native gas-exchange formulations, as is the trend since 2000 (figure 9, see also electronic supplementary material, figure S7 for the barplot equivalent to figure 5 but with MPI-SOM-FFN native gas-exchange calculation).In addition to artefacts due to skewed data distribution, choices in gas-exchange calculations contribute to discrepancies between air-sea CO 2 fluxes from mapping methods and from the ocean biogeochemistry model.

        <p>We further use the gridded FESOM-REcoM output to test the effects of offline gas-exchange calculation with monthly time stepping as is done in the MPI-SOM-FFN and most other products (CarboScope uses a daily time-step), and choice of the gas transfer coefficient (figure 9 third column). Differences between the direct model output (FESOM-REcoM, online calculation at every 15-min time-step) and the CO 2 flux recalculated from monthly averaged pCO 2 and gastransfer velocity fields are on the order of 0.07 to 0.09 PgC yr -1 in the Southern Ocean and even smaller elsewhere (compare green and black line in figure 9 third column). We interpret this difference as an averaging bias resulting from the high winds in the Southern Ocean whose effect is overestimated when the gas-exchange calculation is done on a monthly time-step. An interpolation bias in pCO 2 and auxiliary fields may contribute as well (interpolation bias in CO 2 flux is small, 0.03 PgC yr -1 ). Tests with 6-hourly model output result in an estimate of the error associated with using monthly time-steps for gas-exchange calculation of 0.05-0.06 PgC yr -1 in the Southern Ocean and globally (as biases of -0.03 PgC yr -1 in the tropics and +0.03 PgC yr -1 in the North compensate). We note that this error is small, but it has the same spatial distribution as the CO 2 flux bias (compare electronic supplementary material, figure S5 and figure 6) leading to CO 2 uptake that is too strong in the temperate and high latitudes. We conclude that the procedure of using monthly fields to calculate gas-exchange works within reasonably small uncertainty.We further use the gridded FESOM-REcoM output to test the effects of offline gas-exchange calculation with monthly time stepping as is done in the MPI-SOM-FFN and most other products (CarboScope uses a daily time-step), and choice of the gas transfer coefficient (figure 9 third column).

        <p>Another source of uncertainty is the recommended and commonly applied scaling of the coefficient of gas-transfer a to reach a global mean value of the gas-transfer velocity of 16.5 cm h -1 [53]. This scaling is applied in the native gas-exchange calculations in MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope. The coefficient of gas-transfer in FESOM-REcoM is not scaled and the gas-transfer velocity yields a long-term mean of 14.0 cm h -1 . We test the effect of the scaling of the gas-exchange, which we approximate by scaling the gas-transfer velocity k w from FESOM-REcoM to 16.5 cm h -1 [53], rather than adjusting the coefficient of gas-transfer as commonly done [53,55]. This approach leads to a global flux increase by 0.17-0.48 PgC yr -1 , and this difference also increases over time and stems in roughly equal amounts from the North and South (compare green and orange lines in figure 9 third column). A previous study [55] reported a difference in CO 2 flux of 0.07 PgC yr -1 between scaled and unscaled JRA forcing (note that this is a different version than the JRA55-do data set, which adjusts biases in JRA55 [9], used in FESOM-REcoM).Another source of uncertainty is the recommended and commonly applied scaling of the coefficient of gas-transfer a to reach a global mean value of the gas-transfer velocity of 16.5 cm h -1 [53].

        <p>sensitivity of the ocean biogeochemistry model to choices in the coefficient of gas-transfer. The difference between the two simulations quickly decreases from about 0.25 PgC yr -1 globally in the first years to reach 0.07 PgC yr -1 at the end of the simulated period (compare black and light blue lines in figure 9 third column). The change over time is likely attributable to the lack of spinup. This is a notably small effect in CO 2 flux given that the global mean gas-transfer velocity is substantially higher with 17.2 cm h -1 relative to the 14.0 cm h -1 in the standard simulation. The reason for the low sensitivity of the ocean biogeochemistry model to the gas-transfer coefficient is that the pCO 2 difference between ocean and atmosphere that determines the CO 2 flux between these two compartments quickly adjusts to the initially higher flux [56]. The transfer of carbon between the surface mixed layer and the ocean interior is then the rate-determining step for airsea CO 2 flux in the model as in the real world. However, the regional distribution of the flux seems to be sensitive to the choice in gas-transfer coefficient, with the difference originating mainly from the North (0.06 PgC yr -1 , figure 9). All in all, the scaling of the gas-transfer coefficient to reach the best estimate of the global gas-transfer velocity explains the majority of the difference between the two products' CO 2 flux reconstructions with their native and FESOM-REcoM gas-transfer velocity. Additional uncertainty comes from the use of a different wind product in the native gas-exchange calculation in MPI-SOM-FFN (ERA5) than in FESOM-REcoM, and a different atmospheric pCO 2 field in the native gas-exchange calculation of CarboScope.

        <p>We investigated the uncertainty in pCO 2 observation based estimates of the ocean carbon sink due to data sparsity. We show that two pCO 2 mapping products using input data according to the SOCAT data distribution overestimate the global mean CO 2 flux, and the trend since 2000 relative to the known model truth (figure 4). Our experiments suggest that the strong decadal variability, and particularly the reinvigoration of the Southern Ocean carbon sink [57] is to a large degree an artefact generated by sparse and decadally skewed data distributions, in line with the finding that the neural network based MPI-SOM-FFN method overestimates decadal variability in the Southern Ocean by 30% [31]. We relate the overestimation of the sink since the late 1990s to the skewed SOCAT data distribution towards low pCO 2 (figure 3) that leads the neural network to also underestimate pCO 2 by 5-10 µatm averaged over the Southern Ocean (figure 7). Interestingly, the dynamics of the reconstructed ocean carbon sink in the 'stagnation' period of the 1990s is less affected by data sparsity and appears to be real. The more robust reconstruction for the 1990s may be related to the distribution of observations in pCO 2 space, which is not skewed towards low pCO 2 values in the period 1982-1999 in our analysis (figure 3).We investigated the uncertainty in pCO 2 observation based estimates of the ocean carbon sink due to data sparsity.

        <p>Even with the ideal sampling scheme, the mean Southern Ocean flux is consistently overestimated by about 0.2 PgC yr -1 in MPI-SOM-FFN. This seems to be a methodological issue that may be related to the fact that MPI-SOM-FFN aims to minimize the global mismatch with SOCAT observations. While regional pCO 2 biases average out in the first 20 years of the timeseries (figure 7), the local pCO 2 biases in high wind speed regions do not compensate in terms of CO 2 flux (figure 6). Further, the biogeochemical provinces that merge regions from different parts of the globe with similar environmental conditions may contribute as well [23]. Southern Ocean mean flux and its trend are also reduced with the ideal sampling in CarboScope, but the effect is smaller than in MPI-SOM-FFN. This is because the CarboScope mixed layer scheme reproduces Southern Ocean pCO 2 well even with the skewed data distribution. A mean pCO 2 offset of -2 to -3 µatm in CarboScope (figure 7) stems from local biases in ice-covered regions which are less important for gas-exchange (figure 8). Similarly, in the North, which is the best observed area, a regularly spaced observation network and equal distribution in pCO 2 space (figure 3) leads to reduction in pCO 2 bias in both products (figure 7) and to a reduced CO 2 flux trend since 2000 in MPI-SOM-FFN. The results illustrate that a process-based mapping method as CarboScope is less prone to biases due to data distribution. This is because a neural network can only reproduce patterns that are included in the training and target data set. With sparse and skewed observations, not all real world pCO 2 values and dependencies on environmental variables are included in the training dataset. CarboScope normally uses a climatological alkalinity field, which is derived from sea surface salinity and temperature [50]. In our study, the model's alkalinity is used as input to CarboScope, and hence additional uncertainty due to the relationship between alkalinity, salinity and temperature and due to missing interannual alkalinity variations in CarboScope are not included in our assessment. The use of data from SOCCOM floats (2014-2018) in addition to SOCAT has a negligible effect on the reconstructed pCO 2 and CO 2 flux (figures 4 and 5). However, an idealized sampling scheme with 1000 regularly (6 • × 6 • ) spaced sampling sites [36] with high-accuracy pCO 2 measurements would be sufficient to reduce the sampling and methodological bias of the mean CO 2 flux to 2-9% globally, and to 5-17% in the Southern Ocean. This would also lead to a reasonably good estimate of the amplitude and particularly the phasing of CO 2 flux variability (figure 5). Despite the good reconstruction of surface pCO 2 in the ideal ('bgcArgo') sampling scheme, a mean and growing offset in CO 2 flux of 0.4 to 0.6 PgC yr -1 at the end of the time-series remains between the 'known-truth' and the products when using the products native gas-transfer velocity. For MPI-SOM-FFN, this offset can be attributed to methodological biases and gasexchange uncertainty in about equal amounts. For CarboScope, the discrepancy is entirely due to choices in gas-exchange calculation. All contributions work towards a discrepancy particularly in the high latitudes. This is in agreement with reported uncertainties of the pCO 2 observationbased estimates of 0.45 PgC yr -1 -0.6 PgC yr -1 with a dominant contribution from the gas-transfer velocity [48,53,55,58].Even with the ideal sampling scheme, the mean Southern Ocean flux is consistently overestimated by about 0.2 PgC yr -1 in MPI-SOM-FFN.

        <p>The 1-σ uncertainty of pCO 2 -based CO 2 flux estimates in the Global Carbon Budget [2] is quantified as a contribution of random uncertainty (0.3 PgC yr -1 , standard deviation of pCO 2 product ensemble) uncertainty in pCO 2 measurements (0.2 PgC yr -1 , [59]), gas-transfer velocity k (0.2 PgC yr -1 , [59], wind product (0.1 PgC yr -1 , [55]), uncertainty in river flux adjustment (0.3 PgC yr -1 , 2-σ [5]) and pCO 2 mapping (0.2 PgC yr -1 , [23]), resulting in a total 1-σ uncertainty of 0.6 PgC yr -1 . Our analysis illustrates that the total uncertainty is increasing over time and may be 0.6 PgC yr -1 even when the river flux adjustment is not needed as in our study design. Based on the subsampling experiments conducted here, the mapping uncertainty may be an underestimate and an additional uncertainty term due to sparse and skewed data distribution of 0.2 PgC yr -1 (difference between mean flux in SOCAT and ideal sampling schemes) should be added to this assessment ( §3a, figure 5).The 1-σ uncertainty of pCO 2 -based CO 2 flux estimates in the Global Carbon Budget [2] is quantified as a contribution of random uncertainty (0.3 PgC yr -1 , standard deviation of pCO 2 product ensemble) uncertainty in pCO 2 measurements (0.2 PgC yr -1 , [59]), gas-transfer velocity k (0.2 PgC yr -1 , [59], wind product (0.1 PgC yr -1 , [55]), uncertainty in river flux adjustment (0.3 PgC yr -1 , 2-σ [5]) and pCO 2 mapping (0.2 PgC yr -1 , [23]), resulting in a total 1-σ uncertainty of 0.6 PgC yr -1 .

        <p>The discrepancy between the ocean carbon sink estimates by the ten global ocean biogeochemistry models (such as FESOM-REcoM) and the 8 surface pCO 2 -based data products (such as MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope) in the Global Carbon Budget is large [2]. While they matched reasonably well in the 1990s, they have diverged after 2000. The full range of all estimates amounts to 2 PgC yr -1 in 2021, and the difference between the GOBM and pCO 2 -product ensemble means to 1 PgC yr -1 . It is estimated that the GOBMs underestimate the ocean carbon sink by 10-20% as evidenced by a direct comparison to interior ocean anthropogenic carbon accumulation [2,3]. This is also supported by higher estimates from atmospheric inversions (although they often use pCO 2 products as priors, and are thus equally affected by the uncertainties studied here) and O 2 : N 2 ratios [2,4]. Analysis of Earth System Models (which may differ from the biases in GOBMs forced by atmospheric reanalysis) indicate that this underestimation may be explained by biases in ocean carbon transport and mixing [11][12][13], biases in the chemical buffer capacity [15], and by a late starting date of the simulations [60]. Here, we demonstrate that the divergence since the early 2000s can to a large degree be explained by the overestimation of the trend by the pCO 2 products. This effect is stronger in the neural network method than in CarboScope. The effect of sparse and unevenly distributed observations on other neural network and cluster regression methods that contribute to the Global Carbon Budget [24,28,61] remains to be tested. The MPI-SOM-FFN product shows by far the largest CO 2 flux trend since 2000 compared with the other GCB2022 pCO 2 products (table 1), although the exact numbers depend on chosen start date. However, cluster-regression (OS-ETHZ-GRaCER) and neural network (CMEMS-LESCE-FFNN) approaches can also have trend estimates on the lower end of the spectrum (table 1), reflecting the role of methodological choices within these methods. Yet, all pCO 2 products show a larger trend than the GOBM ensemble mean and also higher than the GOBM with the largest trend (table 1). Notably, the standard deviation of the pCO 2 products' trends is an order of magnitude larger than of the GOBMs, illustrating that the trend is poorly constrained by the pCO 2 products. The trend in the GOBM FESOM-1.4-REcoM (0.43 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ) that is used here, falls close to the GOBM ensemble average (0.41 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ) and close to the successor version FESOM-2.1-REcoM2 (0.45 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ). This indicates that the data distribution plays a role in the full set of observational products within the Global Carbon Budget. A pCO 2 -product based on pCO 2 mismatches between GOBMs and observations [62] clusters with a few products estimating a somewhat slower growing ocean carbon sink, but still close to the product ensemble average and well above any GOBM estimate (table 1). In conclusion, we advocate for continued [29] and observation-system design experiments [31,32] to understand the biases in all mapping methods. The ensemble of global ocean biogeochemistry models forced with atmospheric reanalysis and observed atmospheric CO 2 as used in the GCB are closer to interannual climate and carbon variability than Earth System Models, and thus are an ideal tool for such experiments. While the results on data distribution may be dependent on the simulated pCO 2 in the ocean model used, the subsampling experiment demonstrates the sensitivity of the mapping products to sparse and unevenly distributed observations, as well as uncertainties in gas-exchange choices.The discrepancy between the ocean carbon sink estimates by the ten global ocean biogeochemistry models (such as FESOM-REcoM) and the 8 surface pCO 2 -based data products (such as MPI-SOM-FFN and CarboScope) in the Global Carbon Budget is large [2]. While they matched reasonably well in the 1990s, they have diverged after 2000. The full range of all estimates amounts to 2 PgC yr -1 in 2021, and the difference between the GOBM and pCO 2 -product ensemble means to 1 PgC yr -1 . It is estimated that the GOBMs underestimate the ocean carbon sink by 10-20% as evidenced by a direct comparison to interior ocean anthropogenic carbon accumulation [2,3]. This is also supported by higher estimates from atmospheric inversions (although they often use pCO 2 products as priors, and are thus equally affected by the uncertainties studied here) and O 2 : N 2 ratios [2,4]. Analysis of Earth System Models (which may differ from the biases in GOBMs forced by atmospheric reanalysis) indicate that this underestimation may be explained by biases in ocean carbon transport and mixing [11][12][13], biases in the chemical buffer capacity [15], and by a late starting date of the simulations [60]. Here, we demonstrate that the divergence since the early 2000s can to a large degree be explained by the overestimation of the trend by the pCO 2 products. This effect is stronger in the neural network method than in CarboScope. The effect of sparse and unevenly distributed observations on other neural network and cluster regression methods that contribute to the Global Carbon Budget [24,28,61] remains to be tested. The MPI-SOM-FFN product shows by far the largest CO 2 flux trend since 2000 compared with the other GCB2022 pCO 2 products (table 1), although the exact numbers depend on chosen start date. However, cluster-regression (OS-ETHZ-GRaCER) and neural network (CMEMS-LESCE-FFNN) approaches can also have trend estimates on the lower end of the spectrum (table 1), reflecting the role of methodological choices within these methods. Yet, all pCO 2 products show a larger trend than the GOBM ensemble mean and also higher than the GOBM with the largest trend (table 1). Notably, the standard deviation of the pCO 2 products' trends is an order of magnitude larger than of the GOBMs, illustrating that the trend is poorly constrained by the pCO 2 products. The trend in the GOBM FESOM-1.4-REcoM (0.43 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ) that is used here, falls close to the GOBM ensemble average (0.41 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ) and close to the successor version FESOM-2.1-REcoM2 (0.45 PgC yr -1 decade -1 ). This indicates that the data distribution plays a role in the full set of observational products within the Global Carbon Budget. A pCO 2 -product based on pCO 2 mismatches between GOBMs and observations [62] clusters with a few products estimating a somewhat slower growing ocean carbon sink, but still close to the product ensemble average and well above any GOBM estimate (table 1). In conclusion, we advocate for continued [29] and observation-system design experiments [31,32] to understand the biases in all mapping methods. The ensemble of global ocean biogeochemistry models forced with atmospheric reanalysis and observed atmospheric CO 2 as used in the GCB are closer to interannual climate and carbon variability than Earth System Models, and thus are an ideal tool for such experiments. While the results on data distribution may be dependent on the simulated pCO 2 in the ocean model used, the subsampling experiment demonstrates the sensitivity of the mapping products to sparse and unevenly distributed observations, as well as uncertainties in gas-exchange choices.</p>
        <p>In terms of decadal and interannual variability, the pCO 2 products are skilful when driven with sufficient and evenly distributed pCO 2 observations. We note that the metric for amplitude of variability (standard deviation of detrended time-series) does not separate between interannual and decadal variability and thus needs to be interpreted with some caution. Inspection of the time-series (figure 4) indicates the reduction of erroneous decadal variability and slight improvement in interannual variability in the ideal bgcArgo sampling scheme (except for MPI-SOM-FFN in the tropics). We further note that also the estimate of variability and trend is affected by choices in gas-exchange calculations.In terms of decadal and interannual variability, the pCO 2 products are skilful when driven with sufficient and evenly distributed pCO 2 observations.

        <p>In agreement with previous studies of observation system design [31][32][33], we emphasize the need for a sustained and coherent network of high-quality pCO 2 observations. Ship-based measurements provide high-accuracy data, but are too sparse in many regions of the ocean, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. A combination of multiple platforms will be needed including autonomous devices, such as biogeochemical Argo floats, but also saildrones [37], wave gliders, moorings. We demonstrate that an observation network with a coverage similar to the planned global deployment of 1000 biogeochemical Argo floats may be sufficient to fill the gaps in the current ship-based networks. In reality, the network will not follow such a regular distribution, and high accuracy pCO 2 measurements will be needed to at least partially fill the gaps in the Southern Ocean. The bgcArgo floats are equipped with pH sensors, and hence pCO 2 needs to be derived from pH and a multi-linear regression-derived alkalinity estimate. Currently, this procedure is associated with uncertainties that are substantially larger than for the pCO 2 measurements on ships [18,35,63]. Our analysis reveals that systematic biases of around 5 µatm can lead to large errors in reconstructed pCO 2 and CO 2 flux. As the array of biogeochemical Argo floats expands, it will be essential to conduct on-going intercomparisons between float and ship-based measurements with the goal of developing an unbiased multi-platform sampling array that captures the relevant spatial and temporal variability. This may involve more extensive sampling of surface pH and alkalinity on research vessels and ships of opportunity to allow better assessment of float pH and salinity-derived alkalinity and targeting float locations for purposeful crossover comparisons.In agreement with previous studies of observation system design [31][32][33], we emphasize the need for a sustained and coherent network of high-quality pCO 2 observations.

        <p>We have assessed the sensitivity of surface ocean pCO 2 reconstructions to sparse observations and uneven sampling in space and time. The Southern Ocean decadal variability stands out as being especially prone to such uncertainties, and this is stronger in the neural network compared with the process-based mapping scheme. We thus caution the reader to not relate to pCO 2 products as observations, but to acknowledge that they are statistical models of sparse observations. There are two possible ways forward that both need to be addressed in order to improve robustness of the ocean carbon monitoring system. First, the observational network must be strengthened, with sustained and operational funding and with a combination of multiple platforms. Notably, the total number of global high-quality ocean CO 2 observations has surpassed the number of observations in our tested 'ideal' sampling design, indicating that the considerate distribution of sampling sites is more important than simply adding more observations in the same places. Secondly, the mapping methods should be routinely evaluated for their ability to handle skewed data distribution, and should be improved when necessary.We have assessed the sensitivity of surface ocean pCO 2 reconstructions to sparse observations and uneven sampling in space and time.
