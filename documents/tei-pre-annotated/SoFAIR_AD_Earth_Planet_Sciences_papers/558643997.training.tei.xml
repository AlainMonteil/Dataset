        <p>In this study, based on the 55-yearly wind reanalysis dataset of the JRA-55 model developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Spatio-temporal variation of wind energy potential, as well as rates of change in the whole period were assessed in the South China Sea. Furthermore, a methodology to determine the most suitable location and wind turbine of offshore wind energy extraction based on different factors including long-term change and wave condition on the south coast of China was proposed. The results showed that the Luzon strait and Taiwan strait showed higher wind energy potential. However, the intra-annual fluctuation of the wind resources is significantly high in Luzon Strait, ranging from 400 to 2500 W/m 2 . The investigation of long-term changes showed that most of the South China Sea experienced a remarkable decrease in the second decade (1971)(1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978)(1979)(1980), but the overall long-term wind energy trend during five decades was mostly neutral. The investigation in the selected points indicated that the most suitable location and wind turbines are the nearshore of Quanzhou, Fujian and SWT-7.0-154, respectively.

        <p>China, being exposed to the East and South China Sea, is capable of providing parts of its energy demand from marine resources, especially from offshore wind energy. Although China has the largest installed capacity of wind energy globally, offshore wind energy only accounts for 2% (WINDPOWER, n.d.). There are many offshore wind farms under construction in China, such as Jiangsu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, etc. But China's rapid economic expansion requires new areas of innovation, learning, and improvement to accelerate offshore wind deployment (Renewables Consulting Group, 2020).

Since 2007, more than 100 wind turbines' accidents have occurred each year, and 326 failure accidents have occurred from 2012 to 2013. Previous studies have shown that 52.2% of large wind turbine tower collapses are caused by strong winds and storms (Chou and Tu, 2011). For example, in 2008, a strong typhoon "Jangmi" struck Taiwan and caused the collapse of No. 2 wind turbine on the shore of Taichung Harbor (Chou and Tu, 2011). The extreme wind speed has been considered in the previous studies (Zheng et al., 2018;Costoya et al., 2020).Another important consideration for offshore structures is the device survivability in extreme conditions.

        <p>Accessibility is a crucial characteristic for offshore wind farms in operation and maintenance (O&amp;M), and it requires long enough time slots to ensure that sea conditions are suitable and safe for crew and vessel deployment (Gallagher et al., 2016).

In this study, the thresholds of 13 s for the peak period, 2 m for significant wave height and 16 m/s for wind speed is adopted, as suggested by Gallagher et al.

In this study, 12 wind turbines with different characteristics and from different manufacturers are selected (https://en.wind-turbine-models.com/turbines). The output power of the wind turbine is determined by cut-in wind speed, cut-out wind speed and blade radius. Table 2 presents the main characteristics of each considered wind turbine, and Fig. 7 shows the power curve of each considered wind turbine.

        <p>Table 2. Wind turbines used in this study as adapted It can be found from Fig. 8, that the SWT-7.0-154 performs to the best in terms of potential wind energy production, closely followed by V100-2.0. The wind turbine selected in this study is SWT-7.0-154 as it presented the highest performance of wind energy extraction among the selected turbines. It presents maximum use of the wind turbine and higher constancy of energy production throughout the year(Sant'Anna de Sousa Gomes et al., 2019). 3) and shown in Table 3. According to Table 3, the selected site with the highest energy potential is O16 and the lowest energy potential is presented at site O6. Among all analyzed wind turbines, AMSC wt10000dd SeaTitan and V100-2.0 show the highest and lowest energy output, respectively. with the results based on the scenarios (Zheng et al., 2018;Costoya et al., 2020;Astariz and Iglesias, 2016;Ferrari et al., 2020). It is interesting to notice that the most suitable location is near the wind farms under construction in Fujian (https://www.4coffshore.com/). It indicates the proposed method provides a tool to decide the suitability of sites by considering different criteria. Therefore, the suggestions for future offshore wind power development should be considered near Hong Kong based on the novel suggested approach. However, the wind turbine and site selection should not be limited with the above-considered criteria, and other factors such as national and local development policies, electricity demand, etc., may affect the location and wind turbine selection for the installment of a wind farm.Table 2.
