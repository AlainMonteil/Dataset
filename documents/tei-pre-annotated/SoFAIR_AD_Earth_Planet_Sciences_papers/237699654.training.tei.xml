        <p>Coastal areas are threatened by extreme weather events and climate change. Coastal floods caused by extreme sea levels (ESLs) due to combined high tide and storm surges are one of the most serious risks, which impact upon society, the economy and the wider natural environment. Sea level rise (SLR) further exacerbates this risk over time (Nicholls, 2004;Hanson et al., 2011;Hallegatte et al., 2013;Nicholls et al., 2014;Hinkel et al., 2014).Coastal areas are threatened by extreme weather events and climate change.

        <p>Coastal areas in China are important population and economic centres and are prone to natural disasters, especially for flood disasters (Hu et al., 2018). Coastal China comprises 14 provincial-level administrative regions which encompasses a wide latitudinal range from Liaodong Bay (at 41° N) to the South China Sea (at 4° N), including one autonomous region: Guangxi; two municipalities: Shanghai and Tianjin; three Special Administrative Region: Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao; eight provinces from north to south: Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan. More than 40% of the population lives in coastal provincial administrative regions, which contribute nearly 60% of the national gross domestic product (GDP). About 47% of the national capital stock was found in the Eastern Economic Region1 in 2012 (Wu et al. 2014). Coastal population and assets in China are growing much faster than in inland areas (Seto, 2011). It is expected that this trend and related coastal infrastructure development and maritime activities will continue with the proposal of China's 21st Century Maritime Silk Road programme (Liu, 2014). However, these areas also experience frequent storm surges and coastal flooding which caused approximately US$ 77 billion direct economic losses and more than 7,000 fatalities from 1989 to 2014 (Fang et al., 2017). Additionally, rapid urbanization has led to a sharp increase of exposure in coastal areas in China and has been accompanied by groundwater pumping causing subsidence, plus an expanding impermeable urban area. These risks are likely to grow due to climate change and increasing exposure if no further adaptation measures are taken.Coastal areas in China are important population and economic centres and are prone to natural disasters, especially for flood disasters (Hu et al., 2018).

        <p>Given this situation, it is crucial to analyse the future impacts of coastal flooding in China under a range of sea-level rise and socio-economic change scenarios; and also consider how adaptation could alter these impacts. This information will inform the long-term planning of development of the coastal zone of China. To our knowledge, a number of studies have considered sea-level rise in China (e.g., Han et al., 1995), or sea-level rise in parts of China (e.g., Wang et al., 1995;Huang et al., 2004;Kang et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2018), but there is no quantitative national coastal flood impact assessment. This paper fills this gap by including improved coastal datasets and considering demographic and economic scenarios and coastal protection strategies.Given this situation, it is crucial to analyse the future impacts of coastal flooding in China under a range of sea-level rise and socio-economic change scenarios; and also consider how adaptation could alter these impacts.

        <p>The aim of this study is to investigate the coastal flood damage and adaptation costs across China by considering three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) combinations representing climate change and socio-economic change, respectively, as well as considering two adaptation strategies. This is achieved by two objectives: 1) to generate a new and highresolution coastal database for China; and 2) to assess potential coastal flood risks under the different scenarios and adaptation strategies.The aim of this study is to investigate the coastal flood damage and adaptation costs across China by considering three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) combinations representing climate change and socio-economic change, respectively, as well as considering two adaptation strategies.

        <p>China, using the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modelling framework. The original DIVA database was developed for global assessment (Vafeidis et al., 2008), and includes 226 segments covering 12,288 km of coastline in China. The official coastal length in China is about 18,000 km for the continental coast (Wang, 1980). A major constraint on coastal flood risk assessment at national scale is the data availability and quality (Nicholls et al., 2008). Therefore, when new datasets emerge, it is important to make the most of these in future analysis. For example, Wolff et al. (2016) suggest that a more refined segmentation using updated data within the DIVA modelling framework can improve coastal flood risk assessment. Hence, a new and more detailed coastal database is developed for China and linked to the DIVA algorithms for a national assessment.China, using the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modelling framework.

        <p>Figure 1 summarises the methodology, which consists of three main steps. The first step is to improve the quality and resolution of the spatial assessment units by using a more detailed coastline and segmentation process (as discussed in Section 2.1). The second step is to calculate exposure using elevation and population datasets, and to create a data structure that enables the model to run (see Section 2.2). Last, the DIVA coastal flooding module is used to assess future coastal flood risks for different scenarios and adaptation strategies (see Section 2.3).

        <p>The DIVA model operates on data attributed to coastline segments. As the resolution of the Chinese coastline in the global database is rather coarse, a refined version was developed for this study. To downscale the segmentation and the coastal database for China, we generated a larger number of segments and populated the database with local-level datasets, following similar approaches to those used in McFadden et al.The DIVA model operates on data attributed to coastline segments.

        <p>The coastline acts as a base layer for all the following steps and hence plays a fundamental role in the analysis.

        <p>Urban areas are defined with a predominantly impervious surface environment, such as buildings and roads. Classification were based on visual interpretation of Google imagery and urban extent dataset. Due to the lack of a national coastal geomorphic characteristics dataset for coastal China, an independent consistent dataset was generated with 
            <rs type="software">Google Earth</rs> and photos from the web-service "Panoramio" (http://www.panoramio.com/). Panoramio provides location-tagged photographs for the whole study area and gave a good impression of the type of coast, which has been used to monitor changes of coastlines as an assistant tool (Scheffers et al., 2012). The geomorphic coastal type data was then compiled based on the visual inspection from the available satellite imagery as well as geographically tagged photos. Adjusted from Wolff et al. (2016), in this study, the coastlines were classified into five main types: 1) sandy, 2) rocky (unerodible or limited erodible), 3) muddy, 4) artificial and 5) river mouth (Supplementary Tab. S2). Using this as a base layer, the coastline segmentation was performed within a GIS. The coastline was split every time the type of coast differed based on the satellite data and photographs or a political boundary was crossed.

        <p>There is no empirical data on actual protection levels of China in the global DIVA database. Thus, we use flood protection data of coastal cities in China from various sources (Supplementary Tab. S3). This table provides flood protection standard by return period. For those coastal cities without protection data, we follow the National Standard for Flood Control of China (2014) to estimate the flood protection standard.There is no empirical data on actual protection levels of China in the global DIVA database.

            <rs type="software">DIVA</rs> (version 
            <rs type="version">5.0.0</rs>) was used to assess coastal flood risks in China. Local relative sea-level change is computed by adding regionalised climate-induced sea-level rise scenarios with glacial isostatic adjustment data (Peltier,2000). In addition, for segments located in river deltas a subsidence rate of 2 mm/yr was assumed (following Hinkel et al., 2014).

        <p>Population and assets exposure to coastal flood events are computed using cumulative population and asset exposure functions. The estimation of the value of assets on a given elevation increment is undertaken by multiplying the population count with the local GDP per capita (province level) and an empirically estimated GDP-to-assets ratio of 2.8 taken from Hallegatte et al. (2013). We assume that when the water level is below the protection standard, people and assets are protected, and thus the loss is zero. For people, if there is no protection or the extreme water level is higher than the protection standard, the damage function is identical to the cumulative exposure We utilise the SSPs to account for socioeconomic development. The SSPs provide five pathways of socioeconomic development (SSPs 1-5) including projections on population (Samir, K.C. and Lutz, W., 2017) and GDP (Leimbach et al., 2017). For this study, we assume homogeneous growth patterns and apply the national projections of population and GDP under each SSP to the segment to calculate future exposure. According to mean global total fertility rate, China is a low-fertility country (Samir and Lutz, 2017). SSP1 assumes sustainable development with emphasis on education, medical service and renewables, low fertility, low mortality and medium migration; SSP2 is moderate development, with medium fertility, mortality and migration. SSP3 is with high population growth and mortality, as well as low migration. SSP4 indicates low fertility and high mortality. In the SSP5 storyline, there is rapid economic development heavily based on fossil-fuel, with low capacity in the mitigation challenges (Samir and Lutz, 2014). Thus, the population projections for China will increase from 2010 to 2030, peaking at nearly 1.4 billion populations, then decreasing until the end of this century across all five SSPs scenarios (Fig. 3b). The trajectories are similar for the five SSPs until around 2030. Substantial difference occurs after then, with highest population in SSP3 (~1.0 billion) and the lowest in SSP4 (~0.6 billion) in 2100. As population decline in China is significant in all scenarios, an additional set of runs with constant (2010) population (SSP0) is included to demonstrate the changes due to climate change without demographic changes. The population of SSP0 is higher than the other five SSPs after 2035. The GDP increases for the five SSP scenarios until 2100. The highest GDP is SSP5 (~US$113 trillion) and the lowest is SSP3 (~US$26 trillion) (Fig. 3b) in 2100.Population and assets exposure to coastal flood events are computed using cumulative population and asset exposure functions.

The average segment length is 10.50 km. Compared with the global DIVA database, this is a 10-fold increase in the number of segments, which results in a 136% increase in coastline length from 12,288 km to 28,966 km (Tab. 1). The main reason for the increased coastline length is due to the inclusion of nearshore small islands (e.g. Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province) (Supplementary Fig. S2), as previous studies were mainly based on continental coastlines.The new Chinese coastline segmentation produces 2,760 variable-length segments with maximum segment length of 99.99 km and minimum length of 0.11 km.

Based on the high-resolution segmentation, rocky coast accounts for 9,577 km or 33% of the total coastline.

        <p>This number drops to 0.2 to 0.4 million with maintaining protection standard (Fig. 8). The change of population flooded shows that the effect of adaptation strategy and declines of total population exceeds the climate effect under the maintaining the constant protection. The lack of update in protection and the climate effect lead to higher population exposure, even when there are declines of total population. Hence, maintaining constant protection reduces impacts by about one order of magnitude.This number drops to 0.2 to 0.4 million with maintaining protection standard (Fig. 8).

        <p>The flood costs are shown in Fig. 7b. Flood costs are highest under RCP8.5-SSP5 and the lowest under RCP2.6-SSP1. Flood costs grow slower at the beginning of the century, but then accelerates faster reflecting an accelerating rise in sea-level. The average annual flood cost is about US$ 10 billion per year in 2020. This increases by ~7-330 times to US$ 67-3,308 billion per year by the end of 21 st century under the most pessimistic scenario, with no upgrade. This number drops to US$ 22-60 billion flood damage per year with maintaining constant protection standards (Fig. 8). We investigated dike costs under two adaptation strategies. If there is no upgrade of protection and the dike that was built in 2010 with costs of US$ 644 billion, then there are no additional capital costs for building and upgrading dikes but only costs for maintenance of existing dikes.The flood costs are shown in Fig. 7b.

        <p>Artificial coastline amounts to 14,828 km in China, which is more than half of the country's coastline (Tab. 2). The artificial coastlines in Tianjin, Jiangsu and Shanghai amount to more than 94% of the provincial coast. The lowest percentage of artificial coastline is Hainan Province covering only 11.5% its coasts. The utilization of the mainland coast in China has increased continuously and dramatically from the 1940s to today, driving the creation of artificial coasts (Wu et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2014). The main reasons for the high percentage of artificial coastlines in China are due to (1) massive land reclamation for the need of land supply (Hou et al., 2016), (2) construction of seawalls and embankments to protect erosion and flooding (Luo et al., 2015), (3) seaward artificial aquaculture which encloses many coastal areas, and (4) seaward artificial wetlands with dikes (Sun et al., 2015) (Supplementary Fig. S3).
