        <p>The conservation, restoration, and improved management of terrestrial forests significantly contributes to mitigate climate change and its impacts, as well as providing numerous co-benefits. The pressing need to reduce emissions and increase carbon removal from the atmosphere is now also leading to the development of natural climate solutions in the ocean. Interest in the carbon sequestration potential of underwater macroalgal forests is growing rapidly among policy, conservation, and corporate sectors. Yet, our understanding of whether carbon sequestration from macroalgal forests can lead to tangible climate change mitigation remains severely limited, hampering their inclusion in international policy or carbon finance frameworks. Here, we examine the results of over 180 publications to synthesise evidence regarding macroalgal forest carbon sequestration potential. We show that research efforts on macroalgae carbon sequestration are heavily skewed towards particulate organic carbon (POC) pathways (77% of data publications), and that carbon fixation is the most studied flux (55%). Fluxes leading directly to carbon sequestration (e.g. carbon export or burial in marine sediments) remain poorly resolved, likely hindering regional or country-level assessments of carbon sequestration potential, which are only available from 17 of the 150 countries where macroalgal forests occur. To solve this issue, we present a framework to categorize coastlines according to their carbon sequestration potential. Finally, we review the multiple avenues through which this sequestration can translate into climate change mitigation capacity, which largely depends on whether management interventions can increase carbon removal above a natural baseline or avoid further carbon emissions. We find that conservation, restoration and afforestation interventions on macroalgal forests can potentially lead to carbon removal in the order of 10's of Tg C globally. Although this is lower than current estimates of natural sequestration value of all macroalgal habitats (61-268 Tg C year -1 ), it suggests that macroalgal forests could add to the total mitigation potential of coastal blue carbon ecosystems, and offer valuable mitigation opportunities in polar and temperate areas where blue carbon mitigation is currently low. Operationalizing that potential will necessitate the development of models that reliably estimate the proportion of production sequestered, improvements in macroalgae carbon fingerprinting techniques, and a rethinking of carbon accounting methodologies. The ocean provides major opportunities to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and the largest coastal vegetated habitat on Earth should not be ignored simply because it does not fit into existing frameworks.The conservation, restoration, and improved management of terrestrial forests significantly contributes to mitigate climate change and its impacts, as well as providing numerous co-benefits.

        <p>Coastal vegetated ecosystems such as mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal marshes contribute disproportionally to burial and sequestration of organic carbon in the marine environment (Duarte et al., 2013;Macreadie et al., 2021). Conserving, managing, and restoring these socalled 'blue carbon' ecosystems is one of the most practical and cost-effective ways to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation (Griscom et al., 2017). As a result, blue carbon contributions are being increasingly included in countries' commitments to curb their emissions (Gallo, Victor &amp; Levin, 2017;Dencer-Brown et al., 2022), and there is a rapidly growing demand for blue carbon credits amongst corporate stakeholders (Friess et al., 2022). Macroalgal ecosystems are the largest and most productive coastal vegetated ecosystem on Earth (Duarte et al., 2022;Pessarrodona et al., 2022), and may contribute significantly to carbon sequestration (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Ortega et al., 2019;Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2020) besides delivering a wide range of benefits to humans. Macroalgae have traditionally not been considered within the blue carbon framework (Howard et al., 2017;Krause-Jensen et al., 2018;Macreadie et al., 2019;Friess et al., 2022), largely due to numerous scientific, policy, and governance challenges when it comes to tracing, accounting, and verifying their carbon sequestration pathways. The need to ascertain new ocean-based pathways to mitigate the effects of climate change has recently prompted revisiting of the role of macroalgae as an actionable blue carbon ecosystem (Macreadie et al., 2019(Macreadie et al., , 2021)), including farmed macroalgae (Duarte et al., 2017;Sondak et al., 2017;Froehlich et al., 2019). This in turn has attracted interest from a wide range of actors in government and private industry sectors (Coleman et al., 2022;Friess et al., 2022;Kuwae et al., 2022a;Ross, Tarbuck &amp; Macreadie, 2022), catalysing research and debate about their use as a climate mitigation tool.Coastal vegetated ecosystems such as mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal marshes contribute disproportionally to burial and sequestration of organic carbon in the marine environment (Duarte et al., 2013;Macreadie et al., 2021).

        <p>While recent progress has been made in providing empirical evidence and frameworks to resolve the contribution of macroalgae to carbon sequestration (Dolliver &amp; Connor, 2022;Hurd et al., 2022), their capacity to contribute to climate change mitigation remains poorly resolved. This is an important distinction, because mitigation relies on humans avoiding CO 2 emissions or increasing CO 2 removal through management interventions (e.g. protection, restoration, afforestation, improved management). Uncertainty around the climate change mitigation capacity of macroalgae ecosystems partly stems from a limited understanding of the multiple potential pathways and processes that lead to sequestration (Queir os et al., 2019), which components of the pathways can be managed (Howard et al., 2017;Sutton-Grier &amp; Howard, 2018), and which might in fact cause emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (Bach et al., 2021;Gallagher, Shelamoff &amp; Layton, 2022;Hurd et al., 2022). There are also questions about whether human interventions to macroalgal ecosystems can generate sequestration of a meaningful magnitude, and whether robust methodologies and frameworks to measure, report, and verify sequestration generated by these actions can be developed (Howard et al., 2017;Sutton-Grier &amp; Howard, 2018;Lovelock &amp; Duarte, 2019;Hurd et al., 2022). Additionally, it is unclear whether CO 2 removals from some interventions would satisfy the set of requirements typically needed to be included in climate change mitigation policy and finance frameworks (e.g. sequestration needs to be additional, verifiable, permanent, and cause no additional harm to the environment). This review aims to fill existing knowledge gaps by providing a robust synthesis of the potential sequestration pathways for macroalgal carbon, quantifying the potential responses of macroalgal ecosystems to management interventions, and outlining pathways for their inclusion in current carbon accounting frameworks. To do so, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and compiled unpublished estimates and expert knowledge from different macroalgal carbon working groups. The review is structured in four sections: the first presents a brief overview of the history of macroalgae carbon research; the second reviews the main mechanisms through which macroalgae might contribute to carbon sequestration; the third synthesises current efforts and outstanding uncertainties to quantify macroalgal carbon flows and storage; and the fourth evaluates whether macroalgae can provide climate mitigation benefits and be implemented as a nature-based solution in current policy and finance mechanisms. We focus on wild macroalgal ecosystems and intentionally refrain from contextualising these topics in relation to macroalgae farming. This focus arises because interventions around wild ecosystems presently have substantially higher potential abatement (NASEM, 2021), present more co-benefits (Forbes et al., 2022), and the CO 2removal capacity of macroalgae farming has been explored elsewhere (Arzeno-Soltero et al., 2023;Ross et al., 2022;Wu, Keller &amp; Oschlies, 2023). Specifically, our review is largely centered on macroalgal forests formed by large brown algae (sensu Wernberg &amp; Filbee-Dexter, 2019), which draw the greatest atmospheric CO 2 flux of any macroalgae habitat (Duarte et al., 2022;Pessarrodona et al., 2022) and whose contribution to sequestration is presumably the largest (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016).While recent progress has been made in providing empirical evidence and frameworks to resolve the contribution of macroalgae to carbon sequestration (Dolliver &amp; Connor, 2022;Hurd et al., 2022), their capacity to contribute to climate change mitigation remains poorly resolved.

        <p>Although initial blue carbon assessments did not include macroalgae (Nellemann et al., 2009;Duarte et al., 2013), their role as a natural CO 2 sink in the global carbon cycle was first recognized more than 40 years ago (Smith, 1981;Ito et al., 2009;Chung et al., 2011). Their potential to contribute to CO 2 emission reductions by replacing fossil fuels was recognized even earlier, with the US Government funding the first pilot studies on large-scale macroalgae cultivation in the mid-1970s (Ritschard, 1992). In the early 1990s, concerns about rising atmospheric CO 2 levels led several authors to propose using such farms for direct climate mitigation purposes (Spencer, 1991;Ritschard, 1992;Alpert, Spencer &amp; Hidy, 1992). These publications stimulated the first physicochemical models testing the feasibility of deploying largescale macroalgal farms on the open ocean (Orr &amp; Sarmiento, 1992), and the first efforts to synthesise evidence on the biological potential of different macroalgae for fixing carbon (Gao &amp; Mckinley, 1994). In 2006, the first pilot project to create a coastal CO 2 removal belt using macroalgae afforestation and macroalgae farms was funded by the Korean Government (see review by Chung et al., 2013). While most of the contributions of macroalgae to carbon sequestration originally focused on carbon export to the deep sea (Ritschard, 1992), it was later emphasized that macroalgae may contribute significantly to carbon burial in unvegetated and vegetated sediments at shallower depths (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Queir os et al., 2019). This recognition established macroalgae ecosystems as key 'carbon donors' in the coastal ocean (Hill et al., 2015;Smale et al., 2018). The first global estimate of the potential sequestration of macroalgae-derived carbon suggested that these forests may support higher carbon sequestration rates than all of the other blue carbon ecosystems combined (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016).Although initial blue carbon assessments did not include macroalgae (Nellemann et al., 2009;Duarte et al., 2013), their role as a natural CO 2 sink in the global carbon cycle was first recognized more than 40 years ago (Smith, 1981;Ito et al., 2009;Chung et al., 2011).

        <p>Research effort on the carbon sequestration potential of macroalgae (both wild and farmed) soared after the concept of blue carbon was introduced to highlight the contribution of coastal ecosystems to organic carbon sequestration (Nellemann et al., 2009) (Fig. 1A). Our results show that research effort to date has focused heavily on the fate of particulate organic carbon (POC; 77% of publications; Fig. 1B), even though most carbon is hypothesized to be sequestered via dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pathways (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016). The particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) fraction cycling through macroalgae habitats remains very poorly characterized (four studies), despite the relevance of carbonate precipitation and dissolution processes to the global carbon cycle (Smith, 2013;van Dam et al., 2021). The influence of macroalgae carbon sequestration on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations in sea water, and its effects on atmosphere-sea CO 2 exchange, remain equally poorly characterized (Fig. 1B). Of the 180 publications reviewed on the topic of macroalgae carbon sequestration, 55% investigated carbon fixation, whereas fewer studies addressed fluxes directly leading to long-term carbon storage such as export (18%) and burial (16%) (Fig. 1C).Research effort on the carbon sequestration potential of macroalgae (both wild and farmed) soared after the concept of blue carbon was introduced to highlight the contribution of coastal ecosystems to organic carbon sequestration (Nellemann et al., 2009) (Fig. 1A).

It has become increasingly evident that a more refined understanding of the fate of macroalgal carbon, both at local and global scales, is needed (Krause-Jensen et al., 2018;Raven, 2018), and that verifying macroalgae carbon sequestration will require a thorough accounting of all carbon flows between the atmosphere and ocean (Bach et al., 2021;Gallagher et al., 2022;Hurd et al., 2022), as well as consideration of other GHGs (Roth et al., 2022).Over the last decade, considerable discussion regarding whether macroalgae and their farming support a globally S1.

        <p>A first-order assessment estimated the global macroalgal carbon sequestration potential to be between 61 and 268 Tg C year -1 (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016), albeit how much of that potential can contribute to climate change mitigation is not yet resolved (see Section VI). This estimate is relatively small compared to the sequestration capacity of terrestrial sinks (hundreds to thousands of Tg C year -1 ; Griscom et al., 2017) and of some proposed artificial forms of marine carbon sequestration (e.g. alkalinity enhancement and ocean fertilization; thousands to tens of thousands of Tg C year -1 ; NASEM, 2021), but compares favourably to other blue carbon ecosystems (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016). Unlike other coastal vegetated habitats, the area occupied by macroalgae forests can be extensively increased by the expansion of coastal and open ocean farms (Arzeno-Soltero et al., 2023). Some of the carbon assimilated into biomass during the farming process can be lost before harvesting and buried under the farm soils under the right sedimentary conditions, potentially remaining stored long-term (Pan et al., 2021). Farming also offers additional climate mitigation possibilities if macroalgae products and ingredients substitute products that have a high carbon footprint [e.g. fuels, plastics (Duarte et al., 2017;Sondak et al., 2017)], and those reductions outweigh the GHGs emitted along the value chain (e.g. hatchery, harvesting, manufacturing, transport).A first-order assessment estimated the global macroalgal carbon sequestration potential to be between 61 and 268 Tg C year -1 (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016), albeit how much of that potential can contribute to climate change mitigation is not yet resolved (see Section VI).

        <p>The large sequestration capacity of macroalgal forests arises from their vast extent and high productivity, which results in large amounts of carbon fixed and, thus, available for potential sequestration. Macroalgae are the most extensive coastal vegetated ecosystem on the planet, covering at least 10, 15, and 40 times more area than seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves respectively (Duarte, 2017). A systematic effort using environmental modelling estimated a global area of benthic macroalgae of 6.06-7.22 × 10 6 km 2 , most of which is dominated by red macroalgae (for a review of existing estimates see Duarte et al., 2022). Macroalgal forests dominated by kelp and Sargassum are estimated to cover up to 2.03 × 10 6 km 2 and 1.4 × 10 6 km 2 respectively (Gouvêa et al., 2020;Jayathilake &amp; Costello, 2021), albeit mapped areas to date are substantially smaller than modelled areas (Mora-Soto et al., 2020;Table S2). By contrast, the area presently occupied by seaweed farms is several orders of magnitude lower (ca. 2000 km 2 ; Duarte et al., 2017). Global NPP of macroalgae is estimated to draw 1.33 Pg C year -1 from the water column, with macroalgal forests fixing 0.95 Pg C year -1 alone (Duarte et al., 2022).The large sequestration capacity of macroalgal forests arises from their vast extent and high productivity, which results in large amounts of carbon fixed and, thus, available for potential sequestration.

        <p>Macroalgae can contribute to carbon sequestration via three well-established mechanisms: (i) release of DOC that is resistant to degradation; (ii) burial of POC in marine sediments, including those of other coastal vegetated ecosystems; and (iii) export of DOC and/or POC to deep sea areas with long residence times where carbon may remain sequestered even if remineralized (Fig. 2). These pathways differ in the form of organic carbon sequestered (dissolved or particulate), as well as in the physical, biological, and chemical processes with which they interact. Other pathways, such as the permanent reduction of metabolic products formed via alkalinity production have been proposed, but remain poorly understood in macroalgae systems (Reithmaier et al., 2021;Perkins et al., 2022).Macroalgae can contribute to carbon sequestration via three well-established mechanisms: (i) release of DOC that is resistant to degradation; (ii) burial of POC in marine sediments, including those of other coastal vegetated ecosystems; and (iii) export of DOC and/or POC to deep sea areas with long residence times where carbon may remain sequestered even if remineralized (Fig. 2).

        <p>(1) DOC resisting degradation Refractory DOC (RDOC), which is the portion of DOC not accessible for biological processing or resistant to degradation, plays a central role in marine organic carbon sequestration (Hansell, 2013;Baltar et al., 2021). Macroalgae are known to be important sources of DOC in coastal waters (Wada et al., 2008;Wada &amp; Hama, 2013;Watanabe et al., 2020), and a large portion of their DOC production is exported to the open ocean (Bauer &amp; Druffel, 1998;Barr on &amp; Duarte, 2015). Average published macroalgal DOC release rates (mean ± SE = 238 ± 58 g C m -2 year -1 , N = 83, Fig. 3A) exceed the averages recorded for seagrass meadows (54 ± 13 gC m -2 year -1 ; Barr on &amp; Duarte, 2015), mangroves (150 ± 134 g C m -2 year -1 ; Bouillon et al., 2008), and phytoplankton (0-15 g C m -2 year -1 ; Roshan &amp; Devries, 2017). However, rates of release span three orders of magnitude (0-4390 g C m -2 year -1 ), corresponding to an average of 30.4 ± 12.52% (mean ± SEM, N = 51) of NPP (Fig. 3B). This large variation may reflect differences in species physiology and phenology (Chen et al., 2020b;Watanabe et al., 2020;Paine et al., 2021), environmental conditions (Reed et al., 2015;Watanabe et al., 2020;Paine et al., 2021) and methodological approaches (Khailov &amp; Burlakova, 1969;Carlson &amp; Carlson, 1984), with short-term incubation experiments underestimating DOC (Weigel &amp; Pfister, 2020).(1) DOC resisting degradation Refractory DOC (RDOC), which is the portion of DOC not accessible for biological processing or resistant to degradation, plays a central role in marine organic carbon sequestration (Hansell, 2013;Baltar et al., 2021).

        <p>Most DOC released by macroalgae is thought to be photodegraded or to enter microbial loops (Shank et al., 2010;Wada et al., 2015), where it is eventually remineralized back to CO 2 . A smaller fraction may persist or be transformed into RDOC that will undergo slow decomposition over years, decades, or centuries, and which contributes to long-term carbon storage (Hansell, Carlson &amp; Schlitzer, 2012;Walker et al., 2016). DOC recalcitrance exists in a wide continuum, with most DOC only resisting degradation under certain conditions (Jiao et al., 2014;Shen &amp; Benner, 2018). Specifically, DOC recalcitrance depends on its concentration in sea water, the environmental context, and its biochemical composition (Baltar et al., 2021). When present in very low concentrations, DOC molecules may avoid uptake by Fig. 2. Overview of established macroalgal carbon sequestration pathways. Key processes playing a role in sequestration (e.g. trapping) and remineralization (e.g. sediment resuspension) of macroalgal organic carbon into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are also outlined. Other potential pathways leading to long-term carbon sinks, such as the permanent production of alkalinity, are not shown. Solid lines indicate pathways involving particulate organic carbon (POC), whilst dashed lines indicate pathways involving dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Macroalgal carbon can be sequestered in the ocean by ① burial of particulate carbon in vegetated and unvegetated sediments; ② dissolved organic carbon avoiding degradation (e.g. by sunlight or microbes) in the water column (refractory DOC; RDOC); and ③ transport of carbon to the ocean interior, where sequestration will depend on the retention time of carbon from the ocean-atmosphere interface. The intrinsic refractoriness of DOC is indicated by the scale below RDOC, and is also illustrated as a DOC molecule that loses some of its labile components as its moves down the water column. microbes, effectively resisting degradation and remaining in the ocean (Jiao et al., 2014). Environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, nitrate, light) influence the rates and extent of DOC utilization by microbes (Zweifel, Norrman &amp; Hagstrom, 1993), and high irradiation or temperature can physically degrade macroalgal DOC (Shank et al., 2010;Lønborg et al., 2018). The metabolic capabilities of the microbial communities surrounding DOC can also affect its lifetime (Chen et al., 2020a). In this way, the fate of DOC is intrinsically linked to a range of ocean water transport and mixing processes that expose DOC molecules to microbial communities and environmental conditions. Finally, the chemical composition of DOC itself also affects its lability, and this composition is not well understood for most macroalgae. Macroalgae DOC contains high quantities of phenolic and humic-like compounds, which are typically more recalcitrant than other molecules (Wada et al., 2008;Buck-Wiese et al., 2022;Feng et al., 2022).Most DOC released by macroalgae is thought to be photodegraded or to enter microbial loops (Shank et al., 2010;Wada et al., 2015), where it is eventually remineralized back to CO 2 .

        <p>Macroalgal RDOC is thought to play a central role in macroalgal carbon sequestration (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Feng et al., 2022;Li et al., 2022), and evidence across a range of experimental degradation timeframes shows that a potentially relevant fraction of macroalgal DOC isor becomes -RDOC (Table 1). Yet empirically quantifying the relative percentage of macroalgal DOC that will enter this pool is, at present, complex. From a biogeochemical perspective, RDOC is defined as the fraction of DOC remaining in water masses of varying age, but determining the original source of that fraction remains challenging (Hansell, 2013;Baltar et al., 2021). Assays in the laboratory using macroalgae DOC attempt to approximate the refractory fraction using long-term incubations, but these are necessarily time constrained and are only able to study the biochemistry of RDOC in a controlled setting, which may not be representative of the natural environment. For instance, incubations to measure macroalgal DOC degradation are usually conducted under constant temperature and dark conditions (Wada et al., 2008;Chen et al., 2020a;Watanabe et al., 2020), despite some studies showing that sunlight accelerates degradation (Shank et al., 2010;Wada et al., 2015;Powers et al., 2020) and can affect the relative abundance of polyphenolic substances (Powers et al., 2020). Additionally, the duration of experiments varies widely in the literature (from days to over a year; Table 1), even though the length of time during which DOC is allowed to degrade is known to affect its recalcitrance estimates (Watanabe et al., 2020). Decay rates generally follow a negative exponential curve: the labile portion of DOC is used up relatively quickly, with a semi-labile fraction degrading more slowly and a remaining fraction (assumed to represent the refractory component) remaining stable thereafter (Chen et al., 2020a). Yet, even the 'stable' RDOC fraction can undergo further degradation if exposed to novel conditions (e.g. light exposure after 360 days; Li et al., 2022). The advent of molecular fingerprinting offers promising opportunities to bridge the gap between the geochemical and experimental perspectives of RDOC, as the production and release of macroalgae-specific molecules can be traced and matched to refractory samples (Hansell, 2013;Feng et al., 2022;Li et al., 2022). Coupling these tools with more realistic experimental assays will vastly improve our understanding of the fate of macroalgal DOC in the ocean. An outstanding challenge will be quantifying the labile fractions of macroalgae DOC that become refractory as they are successively utilized and transformed by microbes (Chen et al., 2020a;Li et al., 2022).Macroalgal RDOC is thought to play a central role in macroalgal carbon sequestration (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Feng et al., 2022;Li et al., 2022), and evidence across a range of experimental degradation timeframes shows that a potentially relevant fraction of macroalgal DOC isor becomes -RDOC (Table 1).

        <p>(2) Burial of POC in marine sediments Burial of POC in marine sediments, where carbon may avoid oxidation and persist for thousands of years if left undisturbed, represents an important sequestration pathway in the ocean carbon cycle (Bianchi et al., 2018). As most macroalgae grow on rocky habitats, where accumulation of organic matter is negligible, burial of macroalgal POC occurs allochthonously, that is, only after carbon has been transported to sedimentary environments.(2) Burial of POC in marine sediments Burial of POC in marine sediments, where carbon may avoid oxidation and persist for thousands of years if left undisturbed, represents an important sequestration pathway in the ocean carbon cycle (Bianchi et al., 2018).

        <p>The majority (61.28 ± 4.2%, mean ± SEM, N = 118) of the carbon assimilated into macroalgae biomass is eventually released as POC of a wide range of sizes, from whole plants to micrometric particles. Macroalgal POC release rates (246.85 ± 24.74 g C m -2 year -1 , mean ± SEM, N = 158, Fig. 3C) are within the range documented for other coastal vegetated ecosystems such as seagrass meadows (16-50 g C m -2 year -1 ; Pergent et al., 1994), or tidal marshes (470-670 g C m -2 year -1 ; Bouchard &amp; Lefeuvre, 2000). Macroalgal POC release rates vary across three orders of magnitude and are positively correlated with yearly NPP (Fig. 3D). POC release is often seasonal and variable across sites, and is generally influenced by hydrodynamic conditions (Seymour et al., 1989;Hobday, 2000;Krumhansl &amp; Scheibling, 2011), the life and reproductive cycle of a species (Walker, 1980;Pessarrodona, Foggo &amp; Smale, 2018a;Kokubu et al., 2019), and/or grazing and biofouling by encrusting organisms (Krumhansl &amp; Scheibling, 2011). Macroalgal POC contributes meaningfully to the total POC in coastal areas (Fredriksen, 2003;Bode, Alvarez-Ossorio &amp; Varela, 2006;Yorke et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2018) and in the deep sea (Vetter &amp; Dayton, 1998).The majority (61.28 ± 4.2%, mean ± SEM, N = 118) of the carbon assimilated into macroalgae biomass is eventually released as POC of a wide range of sizes, from whole plants to micrometric particles.

        <p>The amount of macroalgal POC that reaches sediments where burial can occur depends on its degradation rate and transport time. Degradation often includes physical fragmentation by waves and currents, and biological consumption and decomposition by a variety of organisms. Decomposition will transform detrital POC into organic and inorganic carbon (Higgins &amp; Mackey, 1987;Zhang &amp; Wang, 2017). Herbivores also consume macroalgal detritus, interacting with the degradation process (Bedford &amp; Moore, 1984). The biochemical composition of detritus (Smith &amp; Foreman, 1984), as well as environmental variables (e.g. temperature, oxygen, light), are important drivers of macroalgae decomposition (Pedersen et al., 2021;Filbee-Dexter et al., 2022a;Wright, Pessarrodona &amp; Foggo, 2022).The amount of macroalgal POC that reaches sediments where burial can occur depends on its degradation rate and transport time.

        <p>The transport of available POC beyond macroalgal habitats is influenced by particle size and buoyancy, as well as seabed morphology and oceanographic processes. Smaller, lighter particles sink more slowly and can be transported over longer distances than larger, heavier fragments such as whole plants or blades (Filbee-Dexter et al., 2018b;Wernberg &amp; Filbee-Dexter, 2018). Yet, small particles may be more susceptible to degradation (Smith &amp; Foreman, 1984), and the interactive effects between these two processes remain poorly studied. Transport of neutrally or negatively buoyant macroalgal detritus is mostly influenced by wave energy or ocean currents, with higher export rates in exposed sites (Filbee-Dexter et al., 2018b). Typically, a relatively small amount (1-3%) of the exported POC washes up ashore (Kirkman &amp; Kendrick, 1997;Lastra et al., 2014;Smale et al., 2021), the rest being transported to other habitats and/or remineralized. Buoyant fragments generally travel greater distances (Kirkman &amp; Kendrick, 1997), drifting with surface currents up to hundreds to thousands of kilometres away from their source (Harrold &amp; Lisin, 1989;Hobday, 2000;Fraser et al., 2018). Coastal geomorphological features facilitating long water residence times (e.g. fjords, estuaries) can however limit long-range transport, with most algae sinking before being exported (Ager et al., 2023). Interestingly, non-buoyant algae can become intertwined with buoyant macroalgae, potentially facilitating export (Ager et al., 2023). Buoyant macroalgae sink to the bottom as a result of progressive degradation (e.g. gas bladder rupture or fragmentation) and colonization by epibionts (Rothäusler, Gutow &amp; Thiel, 2012), or by being caught in zones of convergence and downwelling (Schoener &amp; Rowe, 1970;Johnson &amp; Richardson, 1977). Once on the seabed, detritus can be transported by a range of oceanographic processes such as strong tidal flows, turbidity currents, or dense-shelf water cascades (Inman, Nordstrom &amp; Flick, 1976;Canals et al., 2006;Mahjabin, Pattiaratchi &amp; Hetzel, 2020). Transport is also determined by seabed morphology. Flat areas on the continental shelf or abyssal plains contain little macroalgal detritus, while submarine canyons, fjords, and convex areas can aggregate detritus (Smith &amp; Foreman, 1984;Filbee-Dexter &amp; Scheibling, 2016;Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Zaborska et al., 2018), and serve as rapid conduits of macroalgal POC to deeper waters (Table S3). Accumulations of macroalgal detrital fragments do not necessarily show a relationship with depth (Kokubu et al., 2012(Kokubu et al., , 2019;;Filbee-Dexter &amp; Scheibling, 2016;Baker et al., 2018;Filbee-Dexter et al., 2018b).The transport of available POC beyond macroalgal habitats is influenced by particle size and buoyancy, as well as seabed morphology and oceanographic processes.

Interestingly, non-buoyant algae can become intertwined with buoyant macroalgae, potentially facilitating export (Ager et al., 2023). Buoyant macroalgae sink to the bottom as a result of progressive degradation (e.g. gas bladder rupture or fragmentation) and colonization by epibionts (Rothäusler, Gutow &amp; Thiel, 2012), or by being caught in zones of convergence and downwelling (Schoener &amp; Rowe, 1970;Johnson &amp; Richardson, 1977). Once on the seabed, detritus can be transported by a range of oceanographic processes such as strong tidal flows, turbidity currents, or dense-shelf water cascades (Inman, Nordstrom &amp; Flick, 1976;Canals et al., 2006;Mahjabin, Pattiaratchi &amp; Hetzel, 2020). Transport is also determined by seabed morphology. Flat areas on the continental shelf or abyssal plains contain little macroalgal detritus, while submarine canyons, fjords, and convex areas can aggregate detritus (Smith &amp; Foreman, 1984;Filbee-Dexter &amp; Scheibling, 2016;Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Zaborska et al., 2018), and serve as rapid conduits of macroalgal POC to deeper waters (Table S3). Accumulations of macroalgal detrital fragments do not necessarily show a relationship with depth (Kokubu et al., 2012(Kokubu et al., , 2019;;Filbee-Dexter &amp; Scheibling, 2016;Baker et al., 2018;Filbee-Dexter et al., 2018b).</p>
        <p>Once it reaches depositional sites, macroalgae POC can enter the sediment during decomposition or be buried by settling particles or bioturbating animals (Reichardt, 1987;Queir os et al., 2019). Laboratory experiments have found that up to 9% of macroalgal POC decomposing on top of the sediment can become buried in it (Hardison et al., 2010;Braeckman et al., 2019;Ravaglioli et al., 2019). On the other hand, fast-decomposing detritus may not significantly increase the sediment organic carbon content (Sundbäck et al., 1989;Isaeus et al., 2004;Rossi, 2006). Field experiments in which macroalgae parcels were deposited on deep seafloor sediments between 1300 and 1700 m have also reported mixed results, with moderate enrichment of the top sediment layer in some locations and depletion in others (Smith, 1983;Bernardino et al., 2010). This could be due to the existence of a maximum macroalgae biomass threshold that can be processed by the community in each of these areas (Sundbäck et al., 1989), and to macroalgae inputs facilitating microbial or bioturbator activity.Once it reaches depositional sites, macroalgae POC can enter the sediment during decomposition or be buried by settling particles or bioturbating animals (Reichardt, 1987;Queir os et al., 2019).

        <p>Overall, the magnitude of POC burial will vary depending on the total macroalgal detrital flux, the accumulation rate of sediment on the seabed and its grain size, and the rate of carbon remineralization once deposited (Burdige, 2007;Leithold, Blair &amp; Wegmann, 2016;Serrano et al., 2016;Queir os et al., 2019;Song et al., 2022). Macroalgae detrital fluxes vary throughout the year, with burial being greater when pulses of detritus are exported outside the macroalgal habitats (Queir os et al., 2019). Sedimentation rates generally decrease progressively with increasing distance from the coast and river mouths (Restreppo, Wood &amp; Phrampus, 2020), being particularly high in coastal vegetated ecosystems, fjords, and canyons (De Haas, van Weering &amp; de Stigter, 2002;Smith et al., 2015;Leithold et al., 2016;Duarte, 2017). Organic carbon also binds more effectively to fine-grained sediments, with the concentration of muds often being a good predictor of organic carbon burial (Serrano et al., 2016). Macroalgal carbon that has been buried in marine sediments will, however, only contribute to carbon sequestration if it remains buried for periods of time relevant to climate mitigation (Frigstad et al., 2021). Remineralization is driven by numerous physical (e.g. tidal and wave pumping, shelf currents, storm waves) and biological (e.g. bioturbation) sediment-mixing processes, and is particularly intense in the top sediment layer (Teal et al., 2008;Hardison et al., 2010;Braeckman et al., 2019). As a result, the depth of the sediment mixed layer shows strong relationships with carbon burial (Johannessen, 2022;Song et al., 2022). On the continental shelf, carbon buried on the top layer often goes through numerous oxic-suboxic cycles driven by sediment resuspension and redeposition (Bröder et al., 2018), with carbon content remaining constant in deeper layers (Song et al., 2022). Burial in deep sea sediments presumably leads to longer term stability (thousands to millions of years), even if oxygen is available (Estes et al., 2019), with macroalgae POC having been observed in cores 1500-2200 m deep (Reichardt, 1987). Indeed, deep sea sediments experimentally enriched with kelp show little colonisation by fauna after 4.7 months (Levin &amp; Smith, 1984), suggesting negligible remineralization as kelp may not be a trophically important resource (Smith, 1983). Although buried kelp may persist in experimental sediments, its actual long-term persistence rarely has been resolved. Continuous kelp carbon burial has been detected in Nordic fjord and shelf sediments over 120 years (Frigstad et al., 2021), whilst macroalgal DNA has been found in 350-year-old loch sediments (O'Dell, 2022) Investigating the long-term permanence of macroalgal carbon in sediments remains a priority for future research.Overall, the magnitude of POC burial will vary depending on the total macroalgal detrital flux, the accumulation rate of sediment on the seabed and its grain size, and the rate of carbon remineralization once deposited (Burdige, 2007;Leithold, Blair &amp; Wegmann, 2016;Serrano et al., 2016;Queir os et al., 2019;Song et al., 2022).

        <p>Determining how much of the carbon stored in marine sediments is derived from macroalgae remains a key step to resolving their contribution to carbon sequestration. Improvements in carbon tracing techniques, such as stable isotope analysis and environmental DNA (eDNA) combined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), have recently enabled the identification of macroalgae among the potential sources of organic carbon in marine sediments, which are usually coarsely resolved. Macroalgal eDNA is commonly found in nearshore marine sediments, suggesting they contribute to carbon burial (Ortega et al., 2019;Queir os et al., 2019Queir os et al., , 2022;;Frigstad et al., 2021;O'Dell, 2022;Ørberg et al., 2022). Few studies to date have quantified their actual contribution, as finding macroalgae-specific biomarkers has remained challenging. In coastal vegetated sediments, macroalgae have been found to contribute up to 68% of the carbon buried (Kindeberg et al., 2019). In other unvegetated coastal sediments (e.g. canyons, fjords, continental shelves; Table 2), average macroalgae contributions to the total organic carbon buried range from 10 to 55%. Existing macroalgae burial rates vary from 1.5 to 17 g C m -2 year -1 (Table 2), representing around 9% of the macroalgal POC exported as detritus (Queir os et al., 2019;Frigstad et al., 2021;Zaborska et al., 2018), or 4% of NPP (Frigstad et al., 2021). A coring study conducted along a fjord and the continental shelf of Norway suggested a POC burial rate of 460 g C m -2 year -1 (Abdullah, Fredriksen &amp; Christie, 2017), but was based on multiple extrapolations and assumptions and may, therefore, be an overestimation. Burial rates of macroalgal carbon per unit area, in the continental shelf or at the bottom of fjords (Table 2), are an order of magnitude lower than burial rates in mangroves (226 ± 39 g C m -2 year -1 ), tidal marshes (244 g C m -2 year -1 ), or seagrass meadows (138 ± 38 g C m -2 year -1 ) (McLeod et al., 2011;Ouyang &amp; Lee, 2014;Duarte, 2017;and references therein). Despite these relatively low burial rates, the large spatial coverage over which macroalgae carbon is exported may result in considerable carbon sequestration (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016).Determining how much of the carbon stored in marine sediments is derived from macroalgae remains a key step to resolving their contribution to carbon sequestration.

        <p>(3) Transport of organic carbon to the ocean interior A first-order global estimate suggests that the transport of macroalgal organic carbon to the "deep sea", either in dissolved or particulate form, may be the main pathway through which macroalgae contribute to carbon sequestration (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016). Macroalgal carbon exported below 1000 and 1500 m is often assumed to be sequestered (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Ortega et al., 2019). In reality, however, the sequestration timescales of macroalgal POC or DOC exported to the ocean interior will depend on the depth and location where it is respired back to CO 2 , as the time water masses take to ventilate to the atmosphere varies spatially (Siegel et al., 2021(Siegel et al., , 2023;;Baker et al., 2022). For example, the North Atlantic basin 'leaks' more carbon than other basins, with 33% of the carbon exported to 1000 m being returned to the atmosphere within 100 years (Baker et al., 2022), whilst the Indian and Pacific Ocean have longer ventilation times (Siegel et al., 2021). Future estimates of macroalgae carbon sequestration via this pathway should therefore explicitly consider the geographic variability in water ventilation times.(3) Transport of organic carbon to the ocean interior A first-order global estimate suggests that the transport of macroalgal organic carbon to the "deep sea", either in dissolved or particulate form, may be the main pathway through which macroalgae contribute to carbon sequestration (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016).

        <p>Export of macroalgal POC to the ocean interior has been documented across all major oceanographic basins (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016). Oceanographic processes such as density-and turbidity-driven currents can transport macroalgal POC across the continental shelf to depths exceeding thousands of metres (Reichardt, 1987). Transport is presumably accelerated in wave-exposed locations and shelves with short water-residence times (Filbee-Dexter et al., 2018b), but can be remarkably slower (decades to millennia) in wide and shallow continental shelves (Bröder et al., 2018). Alternatively, some species may float across shelf waters and sink to the deep if caught in zones of convergence and downwelling created by winds (Johnson &amp; Richardson, 1977) or if they lose buoyancy. For instance, Sargassum rafts advected below the mixed layer can sink to 5000 m in just 1 or 2 days (Schoener &amp; Rowe, 1970;Johnson &amp; Richardson, 1977). The number of macroalgal DNA reads in water samples decreases exponentially with depth (Ortega et al., 2019). Red algal DNA is the most common, which may reflect the fact that this group covers the largest geographical extent among macroalgae (Duarte et al., 2022). How much carbon these DNA reads equates to is still unresolved, as it requires experimentally determined taxon-specific ratios between DNA and carbon, which are currently unknown. Once deposited on the deep seafloor, macroalgal POC can be readily used by fauna (Harbour et al., 2021) or decomposed by microbes, with experimental in situ kelp deployments finding little material remaining after 40 days at 1300 m depth (Smith, 1983).Export of macroalgal POC to the ocean interior has been documented across all major oceanographic basins (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016).

        <p>The export of macroalgal DOC to the ocean interior remains largely uncharacterized, but will depend on local-and regional-scale oceanographic processes, as well as degradation time. For instance, in a coral reef habitat with low water turnover, Haas et al. (2013) found that DOC exudates were consumed within less than a day, suggesting negligible to nil export. By contrast, 98% of DOC released in a temperate Sargassum bed was transported to offshore waters by tidal flushing or other hydrodynamic processes (Watanabe et al., 2020). Although the contribution of macroalgae to the total DOC pool remains poorly characterized (Wada et al., 2015), DOC export from the coastal to the open ocean is known to be an important flux in the carbon budget (Barr on &amp; Duarte, 2015). Resolving ocean currents and other oceanographic processes at macroalgal DOC release sites and surrounding shelf areas could help determine the fate of this DOC and its potential to reach areas where it potentially can be sequestered.The export of macroalgal DOC to the ocean interior remains largely uncharacterized, but will depend on local-and regional-scale oceanographic processes, as well as degradation time.

        <p>Whilst blue carbon wealth estimates are available for most countries (Macreadie et al., 2021), inventories of macroalgal carbon stocks and/or assessments of their carbon fixation and sequestration potential are available for only 17 countries, self-governing territories, or regions (Fig. 4A, Table S2). These assessments have been largely motivated by the need to understand the climate change mitigation capacity of macroalgal forests and whether they can be designated as blue carbon ecosystems (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2020), as well as to improve marine estate management (Bayley et al., 2021;Filbee-Dexter et al., 2022b).

        <p>Most assessments to date have focused on the carbon held within living macroalgal biomass (standing stock), which cannot be considered a long-term reservoir due to the short lifespan of most macroalgae species (Howard et al., 2017). However, these are presented here as a useful proxy for the macroalgal carbon wealth held by different countries. Although some countries only have data at the regional level, available inventories reveal vast differences in macroalgal carbon stores held by each country. The Great Southern Reef, a system of interconnected rocky reefs running along the bottom third of the Australian continent, and the Eastern Canadian Arctic, appear to hold large carbon stocks (Fig. 4B). Estimates of the carbon potentially sequestered by macroalgae are less common (11 countries and/or selfgoverning territories), but also highlight Australia as a key contributor so far (Fig. 4C).Most assessments to date have focused on the carbon held within living macroalgal biomass (standing stock), which cannot be considered a long-term reservoir due to the short lifespan of most macroalgae species (Howard et al., 2017).

For these areas, a useful approach may be to categorize their coastline considering the properties that can enhance or reduce macroalgal carbon sequestration (Fig. 5, Table S4).

        <p>(2) The amount of carbon buried and stored in marine sediments will depend strongly on total detrital carbon export reaching these areas, sedimentation rate (Ingall &amp; van Cappellen, 1990), and remineralization rates of the carbon buried with the sediment (Burdige, 2007;Queir os et al., 2019;Song et al., 2022).

A major constraint is their reliance on a pre-determined range of fixed carbon that was proposed to be ultimately sequestered (11-23% depending on the pathway; Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016), values which remain largely unconstrained by empirical field studies (Queir os et al., 2019). The only exception can be found in estimates of carbon sequestration in Norway, which relied on carbon burial rates estimated from sediment cores, and whose values were used for other Nordic countries (Frigstad et al., 2021). The development of model-based approaches to estimate carbon sequestration has been useful in established blue carbon ecosystems (Lovelock et al., 2022a,b), and is particularly promising for macroalgae given the complexity of their flows and the amount of parameters that require measurement (Hurd et al., 2022). Building simple, robust, evidence-based, and conservative models of the relationship between carbon fixation, export and sequestration will necessitate advances in macroalgae bio-tracing.Current assessments must be viewed only as a first step towards inventories of macroalgal carbon stocks and sequestration potential.

        <p>Although the importance of oceanographic processes in shaping the fate of POC and DOC exported from coastal habitats is widely recognized, oceanographic models are still rarely used to investigate the transport of macroalgal carbon outside of source habitats. Fortunately, hydrodynamic models are rapidly becoming available for many coastal regions, allowing tracing of macroalgae-derived carbon (Broch, Hancke &amp; Ellingsen, 2022;Queir os et al., 2022). Parametrizing these models with realistic values will require a better understanding of the size distribution of detritus particles, their floating and sinking velocities, and decomposition rates. Model outputs should then be ground-truthed with presence/absence data of macroalgae in sediment cores or seawater samples. Advances in numerous fingerprinting techniques offer promising prospects in that regard. For example, eDNA analysis can be used to verify the presence of macroalgae carbon in sediments or deep-water samples (Ortega et al., 2019;Frigstad et al., 2021;Ørberg et al., 2022), while the increasingly widespread use of Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) or antibody-based techniques can enable the detection of specific recalcitrant molecular species derived from macroalgae (Buck-Wiese et al., 2022;Feng et al., 2022;Li et al., 2022). Ultimately, verifying sequestration of macroalgae carbon will require dating of sediments or water masses, whose sampling and analysis is often costly.Although the importance of oceanographic processes in shaping the fate of POC and DOC exported from coastal habitats is widely recognized, oceanographic models are still rarely used to investigate the transport of macroalgal carbon outside of source habitats.

        <p>Improved mapping efforts are required to produce robust global and national estimates of macroalgal forest sequestration potential, as there are currently substantial gaps between the mapped (70,000-110,000 km 2 ; Table S2) and potential (1,500,000-2,000,000 km 2 , Jayathilake &amp; Costello, 2021; Duarte et al., 2022) distribution of macroalgal forests worldwide. Improvements in the resolution of predictive environmental layers can help close that gap. For instance, predicted macroalgal forest extent at 1 km resolution is twice that predicted at 25 m resolution (Frigstad et al., 2021). Some of the discrepancies may also arise from inconsistencies in mapping methodologies among countries, which either rely on satellite imagery, visual surveys, estimates of suitable rocky area and macroalgae cover, or modelled distributions based on presence/absence data and environmental variables (Table S2). Developing remote-sensed high-resolution maps may help standardize those differences. A good starting point to estimate the global sequestration potential may be to map floating or shallow subsurface macroalgal forests, which will have the highest carbon fixation rates (Pessarrodona et al., 2022). These approaches have been successfully implemented for other shallow underwater habitats (e.g. seagrass beds, coral reefs) and are rapidly gaining traction for macroalgal forests (Mora-Soto et al., 2020). For deeper subsurface forests, high-resolution modelling may be the most costeffective alternative to estimate their carbon sequestration potential (Gorman et al., 2013;van Son et al., 2020;Frigstad et al., 2021;Gundersen et al., 2021). Resolving what fraction of the world's macroalgal forests can be captured remotely or through modelling will thus be an important direction for future research.Improved mapping efforts are required to produce robust global and national estimates of macroalgal forest sequestration potential, as there are currently substantial gaps between the mapped (70,000-110,000 km 2 ; Table S2) and potential (1,500,000-2,000,000 km 2 , Jayathilake &amp; Costello, 2021; Duarte et al., 2022) distribution of macroalgal forests worldwide.

        <p>The majority of assessments to date rely on extrapolating region-or continental-scale averages, masking considerable variability in the amount of carbon fixed and stored in macroalgal standing stocks at fine spatial scales (Gorman et al., 2013;van Son et al., 2020;Gundersen et al., 2021). The amount of data available and methods to estimate carbon flows vary widely within each jurisdiction, which will likely affect the confidence of the estimates. For example, Australian carbon fixation estimates are derived from &gt;1500 individual growth rates surveyed along the distribution of the most dominant species. Those from France, Japan, and Korea are based on extrapolations of the productivity-standing stock ratio from a few species spanning a few locations, whereas those from the UK are derived from a pan-Atlantic compilation of mean growth rates (Table S2). Assessments also vary in the form of carbon considered, with few estimates including DOC (but see Frigstad et al., 2021). Developing standard methodologies and models to map and quantify macroalgae carbon stocks and fluxes (e.g. fixation, export, burial) should thus be a priority for future research.The majority of assessments to date rely on extrapolating region-or continental-scale averages, masking considerable variability in the amount of carbon fixed and stored in macroalgal standing stocks at fine spatial scales (Gorman et al., 2013;van Son et al., 2020;Gundersen et al., 2021).

        <p>Accurately assessing the contribution of macroalgae forests to carbon sequestration will also require further investigation of the direct effects of macroalgal forests on radiative forcing (e.g. cloud formation, albedo), and consideration of other biogeochemical processes that regulate CO 2 fluxes, such as those producing or consuming alkalinity. These are only just receiving attention, as showing additionality and permanence of these processes is more challenging than for those already discussed (Reithmaier et al., 2021). The production and export of alkalinity is increasingly viewed as a significant CO 2 sink that complements the previously described organic carbon sequestration potential of blue carbon ecosystems (Reithmaier et al., 2021;Perkins et al., 2022). For instance, alkalinity produced via carbonate dissolution, denitrification, or sulfate reduction can enhance the carbon sink capacity of blue carbon sediments, as long as those metabolic products are permanently prevented from being re-oxidized (Reithmaier et al., 2021). By contrast, the consumption of alkalinity can offset the carbon sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems (Bach et al., 2021;Buapet &amp; Sinutok, 2021;van Dam et al., 2021).Accurately assessing the contribution of macroalgae forests to carbon sequestration will also require further investigation of the direct effects of macroalgal forests on radiative forcing (e.g. cloud formation, albedo), and consideration of other biogeochemical processes that regulate CO 2 fluxes, such as those producing or consuming alkalinity.

        <p>Carbonate precipitation by calcifying organisms is a major consumer of alkalinity in blue carbon ecosystems (Saderne et al., 2019), and could also play an important role in macroalgae ecosystems (Bach et al., 2021). Although generally lower than that of other environments (O'Mara &amp; Dunne, 2019), carbonate precipitation in macroalgae forests is not necessarily negligible (Smith, 1972;Canals &amp; Ballesteros, 1997). Calcifying groups such as coralline algae are often important carbonate producers (Smith, 1972) and are therefore potential CO 2 emitters if that CO 2 is released back to the atmosphere (Kalokora et al., 2020). Our understanding of the magnitude of calcification-driven CO 2 fluxes and potential emissions in macroalgae forests is hampered by the paucity of empirical measurements. Decreases in alkalinity inside some macroalgal forests have been suggested to be indicative of increased calcification (Delille et al., 2000). Yet, the majority of studies have not found significant differences in alkalinity or pH between the interior of macroalgal forests and open waters, nor between the benthos (where most calcifiers live) and canopy compartments (e.g. Watanabe et al., 2020). This suggests that other processes may be responsible for changes in alkalinity within macroalgal forests (Koweek et al., 2017), or that CO 2 released by calcification can be immediately fixed. This would constitute a positive feedback whereby macroalgae favour calcification which, in turn, provides CO 2 for photosynthesis (Kalokora et al., 2022). The ultimate effect of carbonate precipitation on CO 2 emissions will depend on whether the dissolved CO 2 is released to the atmosphere, as well as on the long-term fate of the carbonate retained in sea water. Available air-sea flux measurements show that, even when dominated by calcifying organisms, macroalgae forests are strong CO 2 sinks (Bensoussan &amp; Gattuso, 2007). More research in this field is needed to unravel the importance and drivers of calcification and alkalinity in macroalgae forests, and in which contexts it may offset blue carbon potential.Carbonate precipitation by calcifying organisms is a major consumer of alkalinity in blue carbon ecosystems (Saderne et al., 2019), and could also play an important role in macroalgae ecosystems (Bach et al., 2021).

        <p>Although there is still considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon that is sequestered globally by macroalgae (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Hurd et al., 2022), protecting, managing, and restoring macroalgae forests is increasingly viewed as an important step in efforts to mitigate climate change (Pidgeon et al., 2021;Vanderklift et al., 2022). As a result, macroalgae are currently included or being considered for inclusion in several climate mitigation policy and carbon market frameworks (Kuwae et al., 2022a;Ricart et al., 2022;Vanderklift et al., 2022). To contribute to climate change mitigation, interventions targeting macroalgae must (i) modify the emissions or removals of GHGs associated with forests in addition to what would happen naturally (additonality); (ii) create permanent GHG gains, at least as defined by carbon accounting methods, which are typically at least 25 years (Richards &amp; Huebner, 2012) but often 100 years (UNFCCC, Verra) (permanence); and (iii) reside within jurisdictional areas eligible for policy and management action (governability). For instance, even though macroalgal forests may naturally remove relevant fractions of a country's annual emissions (e.g. 4.4% of Norway's CO 2 emissions; Frigstad et al., 2021), only emissions or removals beyond that natural baseline can be formally recognized within climate mitigation frameworks.Although there is still considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon that is sequestered globally by macroalgae (Krause-Jensen &amp; Duarte, 2016;Hurd et al., 2022), protecting, managing, and restoring macroalgae forests is increasingly viewed as an important step in efforts to mitigate climate change (Pidgeon et al., 2021;Vanderklift et al., 2022).

        <p>This section will explore these three criteria from the perspective of macroalgal-driven changes in CO 2 fluxes. Information on their emissions of other GHGs such as methane, nitrous oxide, or halocarbons is scarce, precluding an assessment of their potential importance. Methane emissions within macroalgae forests are likely to be low, as macroalgae occur mostly on exposed rocky substrates and most coastal methane emissions result from anaerobic methanogenesis in sediments (Rosentreter et al., 2018, but see Roth et al., 2022, 2023), being particularly high in eutrophic and meso-and hyposaline waters. The decomposition and burial of macroalgae-derived carbon in beaches and anoxic sediments, however, can stimulate methane production (Björk et al., 2023), and requires further investigation. Large macroalgal aggregations have also been found to increase the sediment production of nitrous oxide (Wong et al., 2021), which could potentially offset carbon sequestration. Finally, the release of halocarbons like bromoform by macroalgae may also contribute to the heating effect of GHGs in the atmosphere (Goodwin, North &amp; Lidstrom, 1997;Leedham et al., 2013), albeit release rates are largely variable between species and its global significance requires further investigation (Leedham et al., 2013). Importantly, these macroalgae-driven GHG emissions will only counteract carbon sequestration if the dissolved gases are exchanged with the atmosphere. For example, methane released from sediments below 100 m depth rarely has any GHG effects (Pohlman et al., 2017).This section will explore these three criteria from the perspective of macroalgal-driven changes in CO 2 fluxes.

        <p>(1) Actionability and additionality(1) Actionability and additionality</p>
        <p>The responsiveness of macroalgal carbon fluxes to human interventions (actionability) is key to satisfying the principle of additionality, which ensures that interventions generate net GHG abatement that would not have occurred if they were not implemented. Within carbon markets, additionality also refers to actions that would not have taken place unless carbon finance was provided. For example, governmentowned protected areas managing kelp harvesting can potentially generate additional carbon sequestration. However, that additional benefit would not necessarily meet the additional criteria for carbon crediting as it may have happened regardless of a carbon finance incentive (was government led). Below we provide a brief overview of evidence of human-driven changes in macroalgal carbon fluxes, outlining several interventions that could result in additional CO 2 emission reductions, and discuss challenges in measuring additionality. Interventions can be broadly grouped based on whether (i) CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere or decreases in carbon sequestration capacity resulting from habitat degradation can be avoided via improved management or conservation, or (ii) CO 2 removals can be enhanced by either restoring previously degraded forests or creating additional ones via afforestation (Macreadie et al., 2017). Collectively, the reduction of net emissions achieved through either avoiding emissions or enhancing removals is known as abatement (Vanderklift et al., 2022).The responsiveness of macroalgal carbon fluxes to human interventions (actionability) is key to satisfying the principle of additionality, which ensures that interventions generate net GHG abatement that would not have occurred if they were not implemented.

        <p>As macroalgae-driven carbon sequestration most likely occurs in habitats different from those where carbon was fixed, most human activities will affect either the carbon source or the sink. For example, increased harvest of wild stocks will only decrease the carbon donor capacity of a macroalgal forest (Gonz alez-Roca et al., 2021), but the past carbon stores originating from this habitat may remain unaffected. For this reason, we also distinguish whether human actions affect the carbon sources (i.e. macroalgal forest) or the carbon sinks (e.g. sediment) (Table 3). Most evidence for the effects of human interventions on carbon fluxes to date has been focused on POC pathways.As macroalgae-driven carbon sequestration most likely occurs in habitats different from those where carbon was fixed, most human activities will affect either the carbon source or the sink.

        <p>The harvesting of macroalgae forests, or destruction of their rocky habitat, has obvious negative effects on their standing stock and carbon donor capacity. Wild macroalgae are harvested mostly for human consumption (Ferdouse et al., 2018), with Chile being the largest producer (0.01 Tg C year -1 ; Vega et al., 2021). Unless done in a sustainable manner, overharvesting can lead to reductions in forest carbon stocks (Steen et al., 2016;Gonz alez-Roca et al., 2021). For instance, Chilean kelp forests not subjected to harvest management have 50% lower standing stocks compared to forests that are sustainably harvested (Gonz alez-Roca et al., 2021). The total amount of illegally harvested kelp confiscated each year in Chile represents 0.2% of the legal harvest, although the actual amount removed is unknown (SERNAPESCA, 2022). An upper limit estimate of the avoidable standing stock losses from all harvesting globally can be obtained from the global production and average carbon and dry mass contents of kelps (Ferdouse et al., 2018;Vega et al., 2021), yielding 0.04 Tg C year -1 . Besides harvesting macroalgae itself, the localized removal of stones and boulders for use in construction has led to the total destruction of macroalgal habitat in some areas (Dahl et al., 2016). Similarly, extensive losses in macroalgal habitat have occurred during the past 50 years due to land reclamation and industrialization, although these losses are poorly mapped (Kang, 2010;Wu et al., 2020). Creating sustainable management plans and regulating destructive activities could therefore avoid further losses and have a positive effect on macroalgae carbon stocks.The harvesting of macroalgae forests, or destruction of their rocky habitat, has obvious negative effects on their standing stock and carbon donor capacity.

        <p>Changes in the local biological community and in species interactions can also lead to widespread habitat losses. Grazing by sea urchins or fishes can cause persistent losses of macroalgae over large areas of coastline, with grazers playing an important role in determining the global distribution of macroalgae forests (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Scheibling, 2014). For example, loss of macroalgal forests due to urchin grazing in Norway is estimated to have caused the release of 5.5 Tg C (Gundersen et al., 2011;Verbeek et al., 2021). As a result, grazer management is a widespread practice to avoid losses and preserve kelp carbon stocks (Eger et al., 2022). A recent meta-analysis found that removal of sea urchins led to increases in macroalgae in 70% of cases (Miller, Blain &amp; Shears, 2022), although scaling up to larger areas can become difficult without financial incentives (Cresswell et al., 2019), and often requires continued culling efforts (and funding) to achieve long-term success (Shears &amp; Babcock, 2002). Existing management actions to reduce overgrazing include protecting or reintroducing predators or sustainably managing grazer fisheries (Salomon et al., 2008). Introduction of predators to control sea urchin populations in the northeast Pacific, for example, could potentially lead to increases of 4.4-8.7 Tg C in kelp carbon stocks (Wilmers et al., 2012).Changes in the local biological community and in species interactions can also lead to widespread habitat losses. Grazing by sea urchins or fishes can cause persistent losses of macroalgae over large areas of coastline, with grazers playing an important role in determining the global distribution of macroalgae forests (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Scheibling, 2014).

As a result, grazer management is a widespread practice to avoid losses and preserve kelp carbon stocks (Eger et al., 2022). A recent meta-analysis found that removal of sea urchins led to increases in macroalgae in 70% of cases (Miller, Blain &amp; Shears, 2022), although scaling up to larger areas can become difficult without financial incentives (Cresswell et al., 2019), and often requires continued culling efforts (and funding) to achieve long-term success (Shears &amp; Babcock, 2002). Existing management actions to reduce overgrazing include protecting or reintroducing predators or sustainably managing grazer fisheries (Salomon et al., 2008). Introduction of predators to control sea urchin populations in the northeast Pacific, for example, could potentially lead to increases of 4.4-8.7 Tg C in kelp carbon stocks (Wilmers et al., 2012).</p>
        <p>Land use changes and their effect on water quality are also an important global driver of macroalgal forest decline. Excess of nutrients and sediments around urban coastlines often result in coastal eutrophication and decreases in light availability, respectively. These, in turn, lead to decreases in, or total loss of, macroalgal standing stocks, carbon fixation, and export, as well as to contraction of their depth distribution (Tegner et al., 1995;Gorman, Russell &amp; Connell, 2009;Shepherd et al., 2009;Blain, Hansen &amp; Shears, 2021). For example, coastal pollution around the Adelaide Metropolitan Area (Australia) resulted in an estimated annual loss of 0.02 Tg C in macroalgal forest standing stock and of 3 × 10 -3 Tg C in sequestration capacity (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2020). Globally, many macroalgae forests have been replaced by low-lying algal turfs as a result of urbanization and habitat destruction (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2018;Pessarrodona et al., 2021), leading to decreases in standing stocks and carbon fixation (Copertino, Connell &amp; Cheshire, 2005). Finally, the release of pollutants such as metals into waterways can impair the photosynthetic capabilities of macroalgae and lead to a decrease in their carbon fixation rates (Mayer-Pinto et al., 2020). Management actions to improve water quality and reduce nutrient loads can stall declines and reverse them by allowing natural recolonization (de los Santos et al., 2019), and should be effective in restoring the carbon sequestration potential of macroalgal forests.Land use changes and their effect on water quality are also an important global driver of macroalgal forest decline.

        <p>Ocean warming is also a main driver of changes in macroalgal carbon fluxes, and addressing it may hold substantial benefits. Besides reducing carbon emissions to limit the effects of ocean warming, some management interventions such as reductions in harmful interactions driven by warming (e.g. herbivory), and genetic fortification of wild populations with warm-adapted individuals or beneficial microbes, may offer opportunities to maintain or prevent carbon stock losses (Wood et al., 2019). In temperate regions, warming is expected to decrease kelp carbon fixation, increase detrital remineralization, and ultimately diminish carbon sequestration potential (Pessarrodona et al., 2018a,b;Filbee-Dexter et al., 2022a;Wright et al., 2022), especially in warm rangeedge populations (Pessarrodona et al., 2018b). In Australia, marine heatwaves have resulted in 120,000 ha of macroalgal forests being lost in just two decades, which represents an estimated loss of 0.4 Tg C in standing stock and of 0.05 Tg C year -1 in sequestration capacity (0.2-0.6% and 0.6-1.1% of the total stock and capacity, respectively) (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2020). Further climate change-related losses could reduce the sequestration potential by an additional 1-1.4 Tg C year -1 by the year 2100, depending on the degree of future warming (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2020). On the other hand, warming and changes in ocean currents will likely drive macroalgal forest expansion and increases in carbon stocks in some regions like South Africa or the Arctic (Bolton et al., 2012;Krause-Jensen et al., 2020). For example, warming has limited sea urchin activity and mediated the partial recovery of macroalgal forests in northern Norway, leading to an increase in standing stocks of ca. 2 Tg C (Gundersen et al., 2011). In some tropical regions, macroalgae are becoming the primary habitat providers following the decline of reef-building corals (De Bakker et al., 2017). Shifts towards macroalgae dominance can result in drastic changes in ecosystem primary productivity, calcification and DOC fluxes, all of which can impact the net metabolic state of reefs (Roth et al., 2021). In polar regions, the majority of predictive models and long-term data sets available show macroalgae forest expansions and increases in productivity, suggesting polar CO 2 fixation and sequestration by macroalgae is likely to be enhanced in the future (Krause-Jensen et al., 2020). The latter can, however, be countered by melting permafrost and increased run-off in some regions, which may lead to increases in wind-driven resuspension of sediments and reductions of light and benthic primary productivity (Bonsell &amp; Dunton, 2018;Filbee-Dexter et al., 2018a).Ocean warming is also a main driver of changes in macroalgal carbon fluxes, and addressing it may hold substantial benefits.

        <p>Compared to macroalgal carbon sources, the effects of interventions targeting macroalgal carbon sinks are far less understood. The protection, management, and restoration of mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses likely secures the macroalgae carbon that is buried in these environments (Macreadie et al., 2022), including those that are macroalgae derived. A range of human activities (e.g. shipping, dredging, deployment of cables) impact the carbon stored in shelf sediments, with fish trawling and shellfish dredging having the most widespread impacts by far (Pusceddu et al., 2014). The disturbance of sediments by fishing gear is often expected to lead to carbon emissions due to remineralization of the organic carbon stored in shelf sediments (Pusceddu et al., 2014;Paradis et al., 2021;Epstein &amp; Roberts, 2022). Global demersal fisheries have been estimated to cause 600-1400 Tg C to be released from sediments to the water column every year (Sala et al., 2021). There is, however, still considerable uncertainty about the amount of carbon in the sediments that is contributed by macroalgae, the magnitude of organic carbon exposed during demersal fishing, and whether remineralized carbon contributes to atmospheric emissions (Epstein &amp; Roberts, 2022). A review of 49 studies found that 29% and 10% of studies reported decreased and increased organic carbon storage in sediments due to fishing activities, respectively, with the majority (61%) reporting no effect of fishing on carbon sediment stocks (Epstein et al., 2022). Regulating fishing activities in areas with high carbon stocks (including high macroalgal carbon burial) and high fishing disturbance represents a sensible precautionary policy to avoid seabed carbon remineralization (Epstein &amp; Roberts, 2022). Restrictions may have to be implemented for long periods of time, as short-term bans of fishing activities do not restore lost carbon stocks (Paradis et al., 2021).Compared to macroalgal carbon sources, the effects of interventions targeting macroalgal carbon sinks are far less understood.

        <p>Globally, macroalgal forests have declined at a rate of 1.8% year -1 since the 1950s (Krumhansl et al., 2016), with at least 1.5 million hectares being lost this century alone (Filbee-Dexter et al., 2022c). Restoration offers an opportunity to re-establish the carbon donor capacity of macroalgal forests, along with other valuable ecosystem services. This potential recovery could likely increase standing stocks by tens of Tg C, and sequestration capacity by several Tg C (Filbee-Dexter &amp; Wernberg, 2020;Verbeek et al., 2021). The number of macroalgae forest restoration initiatives is still substantially lower than that of other coastal blue carbon habitats, albeit efforts are rapidly scaling up (Duarte et al., 2020;Morris et al., 2020;Eger et al., 2022). The majority of projects are small in scale (&lt;1 ha) and short in duration (&lt;2 years), typically being conducted scientifically to test best practices for restoration (Morris et al., 2020;Eger et al., 2022). It is clear that most restoration projects conducted so far cannot match the scale of degradation or loss already experienced by these habitats (56% of all projects are &lt;100 m 2 ; Morris et al., 2020) and are, therefore, far from realizing the full potential carbon abatement. Restoration projects have generally been motivated by the value that macroalgae provide as a habitat for coastal species, especially for commercially important ones (e.g. abalone; Unno &amp; Hasegawa, 2010), and not for the value of macroalgal carbon per se.

        <p>Operationalizing macroalgae restoration at larger scales will be crucial if this tool is to be employed to increase carbon sequestration capacity. The upscaling of underwater restoration initiatives will largely rely on the elimination or amelioration of drivers of decline and improvements to restoration cost effectiveness. Currently project success and feasibility tend to be low (Morris et al., 2020) while costs are generally hightypically tens to thousands of dollars per hectare (Bayraktarov et al., 2015;Eger et al., 2020). Some costeffective technologies exist however. The recent development of 'green gravel' as a restoration tool, during which small rocks previously seeded with macroalgae are later out-planted in the field, also offers promising prospects for conducting cost-effective restoration at large scales (Fredriksen et al., 2020). Establishing robust links between intervention actions and sequestration represents an additional challenge, particularly when interventions are not directed at the habitat itself and will rely on robust experimental designs. Given that the restoration of macroalgal habitats is a costly activity, avoiding losses by conserving and protecting existing wild habitats may offer a more effective way to achieve carbon abatement at scale.Operationalizing macroalgae restoration at larger scales will be crucial if this tool is to be employed to increase carbon sequestration capacity.

        <p>To date, only afforestation projects, which deployed artificial structures for macroalgae to colonise (Lee et al., 2020), have been conducted at the hundred to thousand hectare scale. However, they do not qualify as 'true' restoration, as they create additional habitat rather than restorinng previously lost habitat (Eger et al., 2022). Afforestation projects rely heavily on cement manufacturing, an activity that generates substantial CO 2 emissions (Ali, Saidur &amp; Hossain, 2011). Manufacturing the cement necessary to afforest a hectare of macroalgal habitat generates 4-5.7 tons of CO 2 : an average of 2.5 cement blocks are deployed per hectare (Eger et al., 2020), with each block containing 2.5 tons of cement (a conservative estimate; Lee et al., 2020) and each ton of cement manufactured emitting 0.65-0.92 tons of CO 2 (Ali et al., 2011). Assuming that afforested habitats could fix a maximum of 7.97-11.01 tons of CO 2 ha -1 year -1 (Sondak &amp; Chung, 2015), and that 8% of that carbon reaches long-term sinks (Queir os et al., 2019), the potential sequestration value of 1 ha of afforested habitat would equate to 0.6-0.9 tons of CO 2 year -1 . The largest afforestation projects to date have created 21,489 ha of habitat in Korea and 870 ha in Japan (Eger et al., 2020;Hwang, Choi &amp; Kim, 2020), which would yield an approximate sequestration potential of 5.2 × 10 -3 and 0.2 × 10 -3 Tg C year -1 , respectively. Thus, it would take a minimum of 4.5-13.3 years before carbon sequestration from the artificial habitat could offset the emissions associated with concrete manufacturing alone, even without accounting for any of the emissions associated with transport and deployment of cement blocks.To date, only afforestation projects, which deployed artificial structures for macroalgae to colonise (Lee et al., 2020), have been conducted at the hundred to thousand hectare scale.

        <p>Central to the principle of additionality is the definition of a baseline scenario with which comparisons are benchmarked. Although simple in principle, determining that baseline in practice may prove challenging for macroalgae forest ecosystems, which often show large spatial and temporal natural variability in carbon fluxes. For example, forest areal extent and carbon fixation can vary several-fold across time and space, particularly amongst the surface-floating macroalgal species (Rassweiler et al., 2018;Vega et al., 2021), whilst export and burial may vary greatly depending on prevailing oceanographic conditions (Harrold &amp; Lisin, 1989;Canals et al., 2006). The use of regional means to stabilize variability may not solve this issue, as it has been shown to lead to systematic overestimation of climate benefits in other systems (Badgley et al., 2022). Another challenge encountered when evaluating the net benefits of these activities include assessing 'leakage': unintended increases in emissions, either directly from unanticipated increases in GHG emissions or due to indirect decreases in other forms of carbon sequestration. For instance, large-scale kelp afforestation could lead to increases in GHG emissions from increased beach wrack (Björk et al., 2023), whilst decreasing the sequestration capacity of phytoplankton due to nutrient reallocation (Bach et al., 2021). The mitigation value of macroalgal forests restoration actions will thus depend on the net difference between the original ecosystem and its likely replacement state. Consequently, understanding carbon storage and sequestration in collapsed ecosystem states of macroalgal forests, such as turf reefs and sea urchin barrens, is required (Filbee-Dexter et al., 2023). Finally, it is important to note that evidence linking human activities with carbon fluxes is mostly documented at the carbon stock level, and measuring and verifying whether they translate into permanent sequestration may be challenging and expensive (Coleman et al., 2022).Central to the principle of additionality is the definition of a baseline scenario with which comparisons are benchmarked.

        <p>(2) Permanence Permanence refers to the net reduction in GHGs not being reversed for long periods of time, with 100 years often being used. Although this timescale is adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 2022), it is important to note that the climatic effects of CO 2 release are likely to persist for longer timescales. An important consideration is that the drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon species (CO 2 and HCO 3 -) from the water column by macroalgae during photosynthesis does not immediately remove CO 2 from the atmosphere (Bach et al., 2021;Hurd et al., 2022). As opposed to oceanic waters however, many of the coastal waters that macroalgal forests occupy are in close atmospheric equilibrium (Delille, Borges &amp; Delille, 2009;Watanabe et al., 2020). Carbon stored in the living biomass of macroalgae cannot be considered permanent, as most macroalgae are short-lived (&lt;20 years; Howard et al., 2017), but forests and their stocks, if protected and consistent in species and minimum size, can be accounted as permanent provided that loss and regrowth are in balance (e.g. persistent sub-Antarctic macroalgal forests 1829-2020; Mora-Soto et al., 2021). Macroalgal carbon stored in marine sediments or the deep sea satisfies the principle of permanence, although obtaining and dating sediment cores is logistically challenging and analytically expensive, and there are still obstacles in resolving the sources of organic carbon in sediments. Both barriers hamper progress in research and in actioning macroalgae-related climate change mitigation actions. Still, continuous burial of carbon derived from kelp has been detected over centuries in Norwegian shelf sediments and Scottish Lochs (Frigstad et al., 2021;O'Dell, 2022), and over several decades near macroalgae and abalone farms in China (Pan et al., 2021). The carbon donor capacity of macroalgae can be recovered relatively fast after disturbance sources are removed (Tegner et al., 1995), as long as negative feedback loops have not become established (Bennett et al., 2015). For example, the full recovery of standing stocks after macroalgae were harvested from Norwegian forests took less than 5 years (Steen et al., 2016).(2) Permanence Permanence refers to the net reduction in GHGs not being reversed for long periods of time, with 100 years often being used.

        <p>(3) Governability(3) Governability</p>
        <p>The carbon pools and flows of blue carbon ecosystems often do not fall neatly into existing carbon accounting and verification mechanisms (Friess et al., 2022), which were originally developed for land-based ecosystems where carbon sequestration occurs autochthonously (i.e. in the same habitat where it is produced). In particular, the spatial decoupling of carbon sources and sinks is poorly captured in existing carbon mitigation policy frameworks, which may present accounting and governance challanges for macroalgae forest carbon. Despite efforts to address lateral carbon flows in carbon accounting, challenges remain associated with governance and attribution. For example, macroalgae carbon fixation can be easily attributed to forests within a specific country, but if the carbon is sequestered in the high seas or outside of national jurisdictions (e.g. outside Exclusive Economic Zones; EEZs) it cannot currently contribute to national GHG inventories or GHG reduction targets (Sutton-Grier &amp; Howard, 2018;Gitarskiy, 2019). This could apply to refractory DOC stored in the open ocean or the POC exported beyond EEZs, neither of which are accounted for in established blue carbon ecosystems (Duarte &amp; Krause-Jensen, 2017). Another governance challenge may include carbon flows that cross national boundary lines, where, for example, carbon being fixed in one country or project is sequestered in another. Some accounting methods (e.g. Verra methodologies) deal with this challenge through allochthonous deductions. More holistic 'seascape scale' approaches are being developed to account for carbon transport across habitats, as well as independent activities affecting carbon sources (e.g. kelp restoration) and sinks (e.g. seagrass conservation) (VERRA, 2022). Accounting for transboundary carbon flows may require new resource governance frameworks, such as those used in management of migratory fish stocks (Luisetti et al., 2020). These will be crucial to ensure that activities enhancing carbon fixation by one nation (e.g. marine forest conservation, restoration) will not be counteracted by degradation of stocks in another (e.g. bottom trawling). Transboundary carbon flows may be common where continental shelves are shared between multiple countries (e.g. NW European Shelf), but may represent less of an issue in large or isolated countries (e.g. Australia, Japan, South Africa, Chile, island states). Developing novel accounting takes a significant amount of time (Sutton-Grier &amp; Howard, 2018), and will rely on robust empirical evidence of macroalgal carbon flows.The carbon pools and flows of blue carbon ecosystems often do not fall neatly into existing carbon accounting and verification mechanisms (Friess et al., 2022), which were originally developed for land-based ecosystems where carbon sequestration occurs autochthonously (i.e. in the same habitat where it is produced). In particular, the spatial decoupling of carbon sources and sinks is poorly captured in existing carbon mitigation policy frameworks, which may present accounting and governance challanges for macroalgae forest carbon. Despite efforts to address lateral carbon flows in carbon accounting, challenges remain associated with governance and attribution. For example, macroalgae carbon fixation can be easily attributed to forests within a specific country, but if the carbon is sequestered in the high seas or outside of national jurisdictions (e.g. outside Exclusive Economic Zones; EEZs) it cannot currently contribute to national GHG inventories or GHG reduction targets (Sutton-Grier &amp; Howard, 2018;Gitarskiy, 2019). This could apply to refractory DOC stored in the open ocean or the POC exported beyond EEZs, neither of which are accounted for in established blue carbon ecosystems (Duarte &amp; Krause-Jensen, 2017). Another governance challenge may include carbon flows that cross national boundary lines, where, for example, carbon being fixed in one country or project is sequestered in another. Some accounting methods (e.g. Verra methodologies) deal with this challenge through allochthonous deductions.

        <p>Carbon finance is most often done at a project scale and relies on cost-benefit analysis (Coleman et al., 2022), leveraging the costs of operation and benefits of carbon credits. Field sampling to quantify sequestration can represent a significant cost and a corresponding barrier to project implementation. The costs of field measurements are likely to be higher for macroalgae forests, particularly if they need to be performed in deep water (Coleman et al., 2022). To encourage investment into macroalgae forest protection and restoration through carbon markets, simpler and more cost-effective solutions are needed. Possibly, one of the most promising ways forward is developing indicator measures and models that predict the amount of sequestration generated by a given activity. Such models already exist for mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass ecosystems (Needelman et al., 2018;Lovelock et al., 2022a,b), and could be adapted for application to a macroalgal forest context. Conservative estimates could then be used when models are applied with little validation required, which is likely to be the case for most regions where macroalgae forests occur. Developing parameters for such models is a worthy task for ecologists, biogeochemists and oceanographers. It is hoped that data presented in this review can serve a basis for the development of some of these products.Carbon finance is most often done at a project scale and relies on cost-benefit analysis (Coleman et al., 2022), leveraging the costs of operation and benefits of carbon credits.

        <p>It seems apparent, then, that while macroalgae carbon sequestration may well be relevant at the global scale, macroalgae-derived carbon remains largely unacknowledged or unaccounted for and is presently invisible to existing climate mitigation frameworks.It seems apparent, then, that while macroalgae carbon sequestration may well be relevant at the global scale, macroalgae-derived carbon remains largely unacknowledged or unaccounted for and is presently invisible to existing climate mitigation frameworks.</p>
        <p>(1) Three potential sequestration pathways yielding longterm carbon storage have been reliably established in macroalgae by multiple studies, which suggests that macroalgae forests likely contribute to the natural global carbon sequestration baseline in a manner that is relevant to local, regional, and/or national scales.(1) Three potential sequestration pathways yielding longterm carbon storage have been reliably established in macroalgae by multiple studies, which suggests that macroalgae forests likely contribute to the natural global carbon sequestration baseline in a manner that is relevant to local, regional, and/or national scales.</p>
        <p>(2) Scientific understanding of macroalgal forest carbon flows is centred around particulate organic carbon pathways, with several key fluxes leading to carbon sequestration (e.g. air-sea CO 2 flux, carbon burial in sediments, production of refractory compounds) still remaining poorly quantified.(2) Scientific understanding of macroalgal forest carbon flows is centred around particulate organic carbon pathways, with several key fluxes leading to carbon sequestration (e.g. air-sea CO 2 flux, carbon burial in sediments, production of refractory compounds) still remaining poorly quantified.</p>
        <p>(3) Macroalgae forests may make a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation in certain contexts. Available evidence suggests that several management actions (conservation, restoration, and afforestation) have the potential to lead to additional carbon removal in the order of tens of Tg C, albeit their net effect on the radiative balance will ultimately depend on the emissions or removal of all greenhouse gases to/from the atmosphere. (4) To date, preventing the loss of macroalgae forests would appear to be the most cost-effective strategy to avoid losing any carbon removal capacity from these habitats as well as safeguarding the numerous benefits they provide. Recovering this capacity from areas where forests have been lost will necessitate increases in the scale and improvements in the cost effectiveness of the restoration actions. Interventions to protect/enhance the amount of carbon sequestered in marine sediments may yield substantially higher (up to 1000 Tg C) climate benefits, but the relative contribution of macroalgal carbon to the overall sedimentary record is currently unknown.(3) Macroalgae forests may make a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation in certain contexts.

        <p>(5) Incorporating macroalgae in blue carbon frameworks or carbon offsetting schemes will require resolving the spatial and temporal complexity of the fluxes leading to carbon sequestration with more locally relevant data (Table S4), assessing the removals/emissions of other greenhouse gases, as well as meeting the numerous specific rules and requirements of carbon accounting. (6) Regions relatively close to each other may have starkly different sequestration potential, and methods to establish reliable links between the carbon fixed by marine forests in coastal environments and the carbon sequestered in marine sediments or the ocean interior are needed. This will likely require the use of particle-tracking models and carbonsource analysis of sediment cores or deep-water samples, tools that are not yet widely used. (7) There are currently no frameworks that consider DOC in carbon accounting, but resolving the fate and contribution of macroalgae RDOC to the oceanic DOC pool, which is posited to be the largest carbon sequestration pathway, is an important scientific challenge. (8) Carbon finance strongly relies on leveraging the costs of operation and benefits of carbon credits. The costs of management actions, carbon monitoring, reporting, and verification remain poorly quantified for macroalgal forests, but will likely be high. Developing robust, evidence-based and conservative models of macroalgal sequestration offers a promising solution to aid project implementation. (9) The fact that sequestration may occur beyond EEZs or within other countries' jurisdictions can present challenges to carbon accounting in national GHG inventories. The low carbon burial intensity per unit area in continental shelves or in the "deep sea" may require that relatively large areas of ocean be protected from disturbance to guarantee the permanence of carbon stocks. This can be a benefit in relatively isolated areas where protection may safeguard significant carbon stocks with low stakeholder impact (e.g. southern Australian shelf ), but can also be an obstacle in heavily transited areas with intense resource use (e.g. NW European shelf ). ( 10) Although developing the methods to measure and verify carbon flows in macroalgal forests presents several challenges (Table S5), the largest coastal vegetated habitat on Earth should not be ignored simply because it does not fit into existing frameworks.(5) Incorporating macroalgae in blue carbon frameworks or carbon offsetting schemes will require resolving the spatial and temporal complexity of the fluxes leading to carbon sequestration with more locally relevant data (Table S4), assessing the removals/emissions of other greenhouse gases, as well as meeting the numerous specific rules and requirements of carbon accounting.
