        <p>Abundant sedimentological evidence indicates that a step-wise drying in Central Asia began in the late Eocene (1) and persists today, but the underlying mechanisms for this aridification are poorly understood and contentious. Drying has been linked to Cenozoic global cooling (2), uplift of Tibet associated with India-Asia plate collision (3), or the retreat of the proto-Paratethys, a broad pre-Miocene epicontinental sea over central Eurasia (4,5). Existing studies of Paleogene environments in Central Asia are mainly based on sedimentary (1)(2)(3)(4) or stable isotope records (5).Abundant sedimentological evidence indicates that a step-wise drying in Central Asia began in the late Eocene (1) and persists today, but the underlying mechanisms for this aridification are poorly understood and contentious.

        <p>The Qaidam Basin is a key region for understanding the history and inter-linkages between Central Asia aridification and regional tectonism relating to the topographic development of the Tibetan Plateau because the basin hosts an extremely thick (∼12,000 m) continuous Cenozoic sedimentary succession ranging from the Paleocene to Quaternary (6,7). Palynological data (8), as well as fossil fish (9), reveal a Neogene step-wise aridification of the Qaidam Basin, but the Paleogene vegetation, climate and surface elevation remain poorly known (10). Secular climate change is often invoked at the Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) to explain an observed shift in the paleo-environment (1), but coeval uplift in the region can also lead to a significant change in the local and regional climate signal, altering the sensitivity of the region to secular climate change at the EOT. Critically, the lack of a quantified uplift history and environment for northern Tibet, especially of the Qaidam Basin, hampers our understanding of the growth of the Tibetan Plateau both in terms of its pattern of growth and the underlying mechanisms driving its evolution. Most geodynamic models consider the rise of northern Tibet post-dates that of southern and central Tibet (11), but the uplift history of the region is obscure with stable isotope-based paleoaltimetry, known to be problematic in continental interiors (12), only indicating a major uplift of the Qaidam Basin after the middle Miocene (13). Well-dated paleontological evidence required to test this is rare, and as yet has not been applied in a paleoaltimetric context.The Qaidam Basin is a key region for understanding the history and inter-linkages between Central Asia aridification and regional tectonism relating to the topographic development of the Tibetan Plateau because the basin hosts an extremely thick (∼12,000 m) continuous Cenozoic sedimentary succession ranging from the Paleocene to Quaternary (6,7).

        <p>Plant fossils are crucial to cross-validate and compare paleoclimatic inferences based on sedimentary evidence with those simulated by models. In addition to reflecting paleovegetation, plant fossil assemblages can also be used to estimate quantitatively the paleoclimate and paleoelevation using taxonomy-independent, leaf physiognomic methods (14)(15)(16). However, paleobotanical records, especially well-preserved plant megafossils, are rare in the Paleogene of Central Asia, with only western Kazakhstan so far yielding relevant (Oligocene) floras (17). Here we report a new well-preserved fossil plant assemblage from the early Oligocene of the northern Qaidam Basin, northeastern Tibet. A high-resolution magnetostratigraphic study (6) constrains the age of the flora to be ∼30.8 Ma. This fossil assemblage provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the regional climate and topography at the northern margin of what is now the Tibetan Plateau during the early Oligocene, shortly after permanent ice sheets had formed in Antarctica (18) and relatively early in the India-Asia plate collisional process.Plant fossils are crucial to cross-validate and compare paleoclimatic inferences based on sedimentary evidence with those simulated by models.

        <p>The Qaidam Basin, with a present elevation ranging between 2.8 km and 3.2 km, is an intermontane non-marine basin bounded by the Altyn Tagh Shan in the northwest, the Qilian Shan in the northeast, and the Kunlun Shan in the south (Fig. 1).

        <p>The leaves of woody plants interact with and process the atmosphere and so have to possess adaptations suited to (and thus indicative of) their immediate environment (19,22). These adaptations are reflected in leaf morphological (physiognomic) features that are preserved even when fossils lack organic material. Such features can be interpreted in terms of the predominant climate using multivariate statistical analysis and calibration data derived from modern vegetation growing under known quantified climates (http://clamp.ibcas.ac.cn). Unlike pollen, leaves cannot remain intact after undergoing significant pre-burial downslope transport, and so recognizable leaves must represent conditions altitudinally and spatially close to the burial site. Moreover, unlike geochemical proxies, leaf physiognomic climate signatures are immune to diagenetic alteration.The leaves of woody plants interact with and process the atmosphere and so have to possess adaptations suited to (and thus indicative of) their immediate environment (19,22).

        <p>The early Oligocene Qaidam flora plots within the PhysgAsia2 CLAMP calibration space (fig. S2), meaning that this calibration is valid to derive past environmental conditions from the Qaidam fossil flora. The paleoclimate estimates (Table 1) show that the northern Qaidam Basin experienced a temperate and wet climate during the early Oligocene, with a mean annual air temperature (MAT) of 11.6 ± 2.4 °C, a cold month mean temperature (CMMT) of 1.4 ± 3.5 °C, and growing season precipitation (GSP) of 1229 ± 643 mm. The CMMT was above freezing at 1.4 °C, but the estimate has quite a large uncertainty (standard deviation 3.5 °C) so some short duration periodic frosts were likely. Notably, the fossil flora does not contain any obligate thermophyllic taxa such as palms (not used in the CLAMP analysis) that are intrinsically vulnerable to freezing, which supports the inference that frosts did occur from time to time. The CLAMP results also show a moderate seasonal variation in temperature, with the difference between the warm month mean temperature (WMMT) and CMMT being ~22 °C, notably less the present-day range of ~29 °C.The early Oligocene Qaidam flora plots within the PhysgAsia2 CLAMP calibration space (fig.

        <p>Apart from the warmer and less seasonal thermal regime, significant differences exist between the northern Qaidam Basin precipitation regime in the early Oligocene and that of the present-day. The growing season (7.4 ± 1.1 months) precipitation (GSP) estimate for the early Oligocene is more than 20 times than that of the present, but the seasonal variation in precipitation was much lower. Based on local climate records (Table 1) the northern Qaidam Basin today experiences a precipitation ratio for the 3 consecutive wettest months (3WET) to that in the 3 consecutive driest months (3DRY) of ~22:1, while in early Oligocene it was just ~3:1, which by any definition is not monsoonal. The precipitation seasonality in the early Oligocene may be lower than estimated since the standard deviation is high (400 mm) and 3WET may be overestimated (22), but CLAMP seasonal humidity estimates also show that the Qaidam summer was the driest season (notably so) as measured by both vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) (Table 1). VPD is is the difference between the amount of moisture in the air at any given moment and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated, while PET is a measure of the capacity of the atmosphere to remove water from a surface through evaporation and transpiration and assumes an unlimited water supply. For the Oligocene Qaidam Basin we estimate the mean VPD ratio for the three summer months (VPD.Sum) to that for the three winter months (VPD.Win) was 5:1, while the PET measures indicate evapotranspiration in the warmest month was 6.1 times that of the coldest. Unlike relative humidity both VPD and PET have a linear relationship to plant transpiration.Apart from the warmer and less seasonal thermal regime, significant differences exist between the northern Qaidam Basin precipitation regime in the early Oligocene and that of the present-day.

        <p>A warmer Qaidam Basin, even at a similar elevation to today, is consistent with greater overall global warmth in the early Oligocene. By 30.8 Ma the mean global temperature as estimated from marine data had increased after cooling across the Eocene-Oligocene transition (18). The CLAMP estimates for the early Oligocene Qaidam flora highlight a marked temperature seasonality, with some winter freezing likely, although the thermal range was smaller than that of the present-day. The difference between the WMMT and CMMT was ~21.5 °C and consistent with a continental climate. It is not surprising that the northern Qaidam Basin had a continental climate during the early Oligocene since it was distant from the retreated proto-Paratethys sea. In the early Eocene the proto-Paratethys sea attained its maximum area extending from the Mediterranean to the Tarim basin, but subsequently retreated westward after the early Eocene and by the Eocene-Oligocene transition (~34 Ma) had shrunk to the present position of the Caspian Sea (fig. S3) (24). While the thermal influence of the proto-Paratethys was limited, this did not apply to moisture transported by westerlies.A warmer Qaidam Basin, even at a similar elevation to today, is consistent with greater overall global warmth in the early Oligocene.

        <p>The high precipitation estimates in northern Qaidam indicate that the present-day highstanding topography of Tian Shan, Altai Shan, Pamir and Altun Tagh ranges that tend to block westerly moisture did not have this effect in the early Oligocene and may suggest they had yet to achieve their current heights. This inference is supported by regional tectonics studies, which suggest the Tian Shan ( 27), Altai Shan (28) and Pamir (29) ranges exhibited limited relief before the Miocene. During most of the Oligocene, although retreated, the proto-Paratethys sea still covered a large area of central Eurasia (fig. S3), and could have been the source of moisture evident in the seasonal cycle (25). A western source for the high precipitation is also supported by the presence of well-developed early Oligocene vegetation in Kazakhstan (17) and evapotranspiration from these thermophyllic broad-leaved forests could have further enhanced regional moisture recycling in Central Asia.The high precipitation estimates in northern Qaidam indicate that the present-day highstanding topography of Tian Shan, Altai Shan, Pamir and Altun Tagh ranges that tend to block westerly moisture did not have this effect in the early Oligocene and may suggest they had yet to achieve their current heights.

        <p>Although stable isotope-based paleoaltimetry points to a middle-late Miocene surface uplift of the Qaidam Basin (13), this is not in conflict with our findings. Stable isotope compositions are likely biased to where predominant fractionation takes place and in the case of meteoric waters this is inevitably at high elevation where rainout occurs as moisture-laden air is forced over topographic highs. Thus, the middle-late Miocene uplift may not have been that of the Qaidam Basin floor but that of the surrounding mountains. By contrast leaf fossils must indicate conditions and surface heights close to their burial site, i.e. in lowland sites of sediment accumulation within basins.Although stable isotope-based paleoaltimetry points to a middle-late Miocene surface uplift of the Qaidam Basin (13), this is not in conflict with our findings.

Here we show that in northern Tibet a close-topresent elevation of ~ 3 km for at least one basin floor had been achieved by the early Oligocene, a time when the central Himalaya were at an elevation of &lt; 2.3 km (32). Moreover, by using the same moist enthalpy method as we use here, analysis of fossil leaf assemblages also shows that the southern Lhasa terrane (14,32) and the southeastern margin ( 16) of the Tibet had reached their present-day elevations by the middle Miocene and early Oligocene respectively. Thus, a combination of stable isotope and phytopaleoaltimetry (10,16,32) is demonstrating that complex, and in places high, relief existed in Tibet before the rise of the Himalaya and that the modern high Tibet is not solely the product of the India-Asia collision. This has implications for the amount of subducted greater India that contributed to the building of Tibet.Geologic evidence shows that the northern boundary of the Tibetan orogen was set in the Eocene following the initial India-Asia collision, although whether a high topography was built simultaneously in this region is unknown (31).

        <p>Although we can say with confidence that parts of northern Tibet such as the Qaidam Basin were at ~ 3 km in the Paleogene, we cannot yet fully reconstruct the elevation history of the region and so understand Tibet-wide tectonic processes with any confidence. It could be that the Qaidam uplift long pre-dated the arrival of India and resulted from earlier terrane collisions.Although we can say with confidence that parts of northern Tibet such as the Qaidam Basin were at ~ 3 km in the Paleogene, we cannot yet fully reconstruct the elevation history of the region and so understand Tibet-wide tectonic processes with any confidence.

        <p>Alternatively, it may be that compressional forces from India were transmitted through southern and central Tibet so that the Qaidam region exhibited far-field deformation very early in the India-Asia collision process. It is also possible that the Qaidam Basin was high at 52 Ma, the start of Lulehe deposition, and underwent subsidence brought about by topographic loading during the simultaneous early Eocene deformation within the Qilian Shan and Altyn Tagh Shan (33). Future paleoaltimetric studies using well-dated fossil assemblages may yet answer these questions.Alternatively, it may be that compressional forces from India were transmitted through southern and central Tibet so that the Qaidam region exhibited far-field deformation very early in the India-Asia collision process.

        <p>We applied the moist enthalpy method (23) to estimate the paleoaltitude of the northern Qaidam Basin during the early Oligocene. This technique derives from the observation that moist static energy is conserved as a parcel of air rises over topographic highs (23). Moist static energy is the product of moist enthalpy and potential energy, so differences in moist enthalpy between two elevations can be resolved to elevation differences by dividing by the constant acceleration due to gravity (g) (Equation 1). Moist enthalpy is a climatic parameter related to both air temperature and moisture, and is well correlated with leaf physiognomy (19).We applied the moist enthalpy method (23) to estimate the paleoaltitude of the northern Qaidam Basin during the early Oligocene.

        <p>Because moist enthalpy varies with latitude, and model and proxy values are unlikely to be identical, any systematic model and proxy-derived mean sea level moist enthalpy differences need accounted for in order to properly use a combination of model and proxy values to derive the paleoelevation for the Qaidam Basin. Any approach to achieve model-proxy parity should also accommodate, as far as possible, uncertainties in both proxy retrodictions and model simulations.Because moist enthalpy varies with latitude, and model and proxy values are unlikely to be identical, any systematic model and proxy-derived mean sea level moist enthalpy differences need accounted for in order to properly use a combination of model and proxy values to derive the paleoelevation for the Qaidam Basin.

        <p>Inevitably differences arise between moist enthalpy estimates derived from proxies and those predicted by climate models. These differences occur because models attempt to represent typical Moist enthalpy tends to vary zonally (23) and GCMs tend to produce steeper latitudinal moist enthalpy trends than the proxy data (REF). To obtain a model-derived sea level moist enthalpy for the early Oligocene Qaidam Basin that can legitimately be compared to that derived from the fossil assemblage requires the model value to be adjusted consistent with the observed moist enthalpy at the paleosurface. To make this adjustment we selected from our pre-existing CLAMP archive roughly coeval Oligocene leaf assemblages thought to represent near sea level conditions across a 20°N to 50°N paleolatitudinal range (table S1). By comparing them with paleo-sea level moist enthalpy values predicted by the Rupelian GCM we derived a simple linear regression of the differences to obtain a latitude-dependent adjustment value at the Qaidam paleolocation. The scatter in the model-proxy differences also allowed us to accommodate proxy model uncertainties, plus any variation in the proxy values due to the fossil assemblages not properly representing mean paleo sea level moist enthalpy. The derived regression equation: y = -0.2622x + 3.645 (2) shows that at the Qaidam Basin palaeolocation the model underestimates moist enthalpy with respect to the proxy by 6.46 kJ/kg. Applying this the model-derived moist enthalpy rose from 333.1 kJ/kg to 339.5 kJ/kg.Inevitably differences arise between moist enthalpy estimates derived from proxies and those predicted by climate models.

        <p>The geological data used to construct the paleotopography used in the GCM simulation suggest surface height in the Qaidam area of ~ 3km. To test that this did not induce an element of circularity in our analysis we also ran experiments where the Qaidam region was given 'artificial' elevations ranging from 0km (sea level) to 4 km in 1 km increments. Differences in modelled sea level enthalpy from these experiments were remarkably small and well within model and proxy uncertainties.The geological data used to construct the paleotopography used in the GCM simulation suggest surface height in the Qaidam area of ~ 3km.
