        <p>A key ecosystem driver in contemporary climate states is marine heatwaves. Marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense worldwide 18 . There has been an increase from 30% in 2012 to nearly 70% of global oceans in 2016 experiencing strong or severe heatwaves and the breadth of their impact is evidenced by a twoorder-of-magnitude increase in scientific publications on marine heatwaves during the past decade 19 .

        <p>The northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) that peaked in 2015 was particularly notable in its magnitude and spatio-temporal extent. The PMH lasted two years 21 and was the only marine heatwave lasting through all four seasons, which was 2-10 times longer than any other heatwave recorded globally in the past decade 19 . In mid-2016, the PMH began to dissipate, based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature data 19 . While in situ sea surface temperatures in some areas of the GOA did trend back toward pre-PMH conditions, water column and bottom temperature anomalies remained strongly positive down to at least 250 m (Fig. 1) 22 . The hiatus in the surface expression of the PMH, however, was short-lived and the warming re-intensified in late-2018 and persisted into fall 2019 (Fig. 1) 23 .The northeast Pacific marine heatwave (PMH) that peaked in 2015 was particularly notable in its magnitude and spatio-temporal extent.

        <p>Biological responses to the 2014-2016 PMH were diverse and occurred throughout the North Pacific, including species range shifts 24 , changes in lower trophic level community composition 25,26 , predator mortality events 27,28 , and effects on commercial fisheries, including aquaculture 29 . However, initial and potential multi-year lingering effects of the PMH have not previously been quantitatively evaluated in a fully integrated, ecosystem approach.Biological responses to the 2014-2016 PMH were diverse and occurred throughout the North Pacific, including species range shifts 24 , changes in lower trophic level community composition 25,26 , predator mortality events 27,28 , and effects on commercial fisheries, including aquaculture 29 .

        <p>The Gulf of Alaska has extensive long-term monitoring programs, many of which were established in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the need to assess long-term recovery of injured resources given highly variable environmental conditions 30,31 . We leveraged data from this wealth of long-term monitoring programs to assess how the northern GOA ecosystem, including intertidal to oceanic domains and primary production to commercial fisheries (Fig. 2), responded to the PMH and subsequent cooling and warming events. We used 187 time series of annual biological metrics (Table 1) to determine: (1) how the biological community responded as a whole; (2) which taxa or metrics exhibited negative, positive, or neutral responses; and (3) whether taxa or metrics showed continued, multi-year response or signs of recovery for up to 5 years after the onset of the PMH.The Gulf of Alaska has extensive long-term monitoring programs, many of which were established in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill and the need to assess long-term recovery of injured resources given highly variable environmental conditions 30,31 .

        <p>Common trends in biological observations. Of the nine dynamic factor analysis models evaluated, the model with the lowest Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) included equal variance and covariance structure and one common trend (Table S2). The common trend line shows a steep decline starting in 2014 coincident with the PMH and continuing through 2017 with a slight increase in 2018, but still remaining well below pre-PMH levels (Fig. 3a). Sampling locations in the northern Gulf of Alaska. The division for references to eastern and western study area is the continuous plankton recorder transect into Cook Inlet. The black contours within the Seward Line marine bird survey area differentiate inner continental shelf (shore to 50 km from shore), middle shelf (50 km from shore to shelf-slope break, defined using 1000 m isobath) and oceanic (seaward of the 1000 m isobath) domains. The 1000 m isobath is also used to distinguish shelf versus oceanic zooplankton samples from the continuous plankton recorder.

The direction of response among time series, however, varied by taxon. Time series with the highest percentage of negative responses were phytoplankton (40%), intertidal organisms (50%), and commercial harvest (50%; Table 2). Zooplankton had primarily positive (warm water associated species) or neutral (microzooplankton and cool water associated species) responses and forage fish responses were evenly distributed among negative (33%), positive (33%), and neutral (33%). Groundfish, marine bird, and marine mammal metrics primarily exhibited neutral responses (50%-65%; Table 2). Notable exceptions within these categories include primarily negative responses of adult groundfish populations, colony-based metrics for piscivorous seabirds in our eastern study area, abundance of humpback whales, and haul-out or rookery-based metrics for pinnipeds in our eastern study area (Tables 2,S1).Table 1.

        <p>Lower trophic levels. Phytoplankton showed a general decrease in surface biomass (chlorophyll) during the PMH. The decrease in cell size during the PMH was followed by an abrupt increase following the PMH, resulting in a positive model fit (Fig. 3b). Microzooplankton trends varied by season and metric with a decrease in spring biomass and an increase the fraction of ciliates during the PMH, followed by a rapid decline, and an increase in fall biomass (Fig. 3c). In contrast, zooplankton abundance trends were primarily positive or neutral during the PMH. Warm-water associated zooplankton species increased markedly during the PMH, with the increase most distinct in continental shelf waters, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and less so in oceanic waters (Fig. 3d, Table S1). There was some variation in the timing of increase among domains; however, most anomalies stayed positive even as the upper water column cooled in 2017 and finally returned to pre-PMH levels in 2018. Surprisingly, the abundance of cool-water associated zooplankton did not show a consistent declining trend regardless of domain, but instead generally showed no trend or a temporary increase.Lower trophic levels.

        <p>Intertidal taxa showed remarkably consistent trends among spatially replicated sampling areas throughout the northern GOA. Algal (Fucus) cover declined precipitously with some variability in timing in all areas (Fig. 3e). Similarly, the abundance of sea stars-key intertidal predators-declined precipitously after the onset of the PMH in most areas. In contrast, the abundance of mussels, a main sea star prey item, increased in most areas (Fig. 3e) and in the diets of glaucous-winged gulls (Table S1).Intertidal taxa showed remarkably consistent trends among spatially replicated sampling areas throughout the northern GOA.

        <p>Trends in two forage fish species, capelin abundance in the eastern study area and herring abundance and growth in Prince William Sound (PWS), decreased markedly and remained at consistently low values after the onset of the PMH (Fig. 4a). The decline in capelin was evident in diets of both surface-feeding and diving birds. The abundance of sand lance larvae in the western and juveniles in eastern study area showed an opposite trend of marked increase during the PMH.

        <p>Marine bird colony metrics and mammal abundance trends, especially for piscivorous species in the eastern study area, were generally negative during the PMH (Fig. 4b). The abundance of nesting common murres at East Amatuli Island, kittiwake nests in PWS, breeding success in PWS and Middleton Island, and Steller sea lion pup counts on rookeries all declined. Parallel declines also occurred for combined counts of adult, sub-adult, and juvenile sea lions ("non-pups") in the eastern portion of our study area, but not the western (Fig. 4b). Chiefly planktivorous, omnivorous, or generalist species such as fork-tailed storm-petrels, parakeet auklets, glaucouswinged gulls, pelagic cormorants, and rhinocerous auklets-especially in the western study area-showed primarily neutral responses. Humpback and killer whale abundance (indexed by encounter rate or group size) in the PWS region also declined after the onset of the PMH, but the decline was only sustained for humpback whales through 2018 (Fig. 4b; Table S1).Marine bird colony metrics and mammal abundance trends, especially for piscivorous species in the eastern study area, were generally negative during the PMH (Fig. 4b).

        <p>Marine bird abundance at sea showed a mix of response trends and short-term, annual variation. The abundance responses of primarily piscivorous species in summer and fall were neutral (murres) or declined (murrelets and guillemots), with one exception of an increase in murrelets during winter in PWS (Fig. 4c; Table S1). Murres showed more short-term variation, especially with an influx into nearshore areas of PWS and Kenai and Alaska Peninsulas during the PMH in 2015 (Fig. 4c individual points). Primarily zooplanktivorous or omnivorous storm-petrels and fulmars increased in middle-and inner-shelf areas and declined in offshore areas during Table 2.

        <p>Response trends in groundfish varied by adult versus younger age classes. Significant negative trends were primarily found in adult female spawning biomass of Pacific cod, sablefish, and arrowtooth flounder (Fig. 4d); and neutral response by pollock (Table S1). Positive trends occurred for abundance of larval southern rock sole and juvenile pollock, and growth rate of juvenile sablefish (Fig. 4d). Although juvenile pollock declined during the PMH, increases post-PMH led the model to fit an increasing trend through 2018. Changes in abundance of pollock and northern rock sole larvae, and of Pacific cod larvae and juveniles were initially negative and saffron cod positive, but these trends were not sustained; this resulted in overall neutral trends (Table S1).Response trends in groundfish varied by adult versus younger age classes.

        <p>Commercial harvest trends in pounds and revenue were strongly negative for Pacific cod delivered to fishing ports throughout our study area, sockeye salmon for ports in the eastern study area and Chinook salmon in the west (Fig. 4e). Pollock harvest showed a negative trend at one port in the east and positive at one port in the west. There were fewer positive trends in harvest, primarily chum salmon and sablefish at a couple of ports in the east, and coho salmon and pollock at Kodiak in the west (Fig. 4e; Table S1).Commercial harvest trends in pounds and revenue were strongly negative for Pacific cod delivered to fishing ports throughout our study area, sockeye salmon for ports in the eastern study area and Chinook salmon in the west (Fig. 4e).

        <p>Annual patterns in the combined community composition of our 187 time series of the GOA ecosystem showed distinct groupings of before and after the onset of the PMH in both the cluster analysis (Fig. 5a) and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS, 2 dimension, stress = 0.08; Fig. 5b). Whereas years were more tightly clustered during a period of relatively cold ocean temperatures (2010-2013; Fig. 1) before the PMH, there was greater distance among years after the onset of the PMH (2015-2018; Fig. 5a,b). The largest changes in directional vectors of the nMDS occurred during 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 (Fig. 5b). The temporal pattern in axis 1 of the nMDS reflects the common trend identified by DFA (Fig. 5c), whereas axis 2 reflects species that responded strongly to the 2015-2016 maximal intensity of the heatwave, then reverted to pre-heatwave state. The DFA common trend was highly correlated with nMDS axis 1 (r = 0.99), indicating that both methods identified the same pattern of response to the PMH. Correlation of individual time-series with nMDS axis 1 therefore closely followed those previously discussed for DFA results (Fig. S1a). Time series that most strongly correlated (&gt; 0.40) with initial response then return to pre-PMH levels described by nMDS axis 2 included phytoplankton phenology, phytoplankton size, and forage fish growth and condition (Fig. S1b).Annual patterns in the combined community composition of our 187 time series of the GOA ecosystem showed distinct groupings of before and after the onset of the PMH in both the cluster analysis (Fig. 5a) and non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS, 2 dimension, stress = 0.08; Fig. 5b).

Cluster analysis further differentiated the 9-year period before, during, and after the PMH into two (east) or three (west) significantly different groups (similarity profiles, p &lt; 0.05), clearly differentiating 2010-2013 pre-PMH from 2014-2018 periods (Fig. S2,d).Community analysis by region showed strong before-after PMH pattern overall, with slightly different year groupings in east versus west (Fig. S2a,b).

        <p>Longer time series perspective. Our time series that extend for decades prior to the PMH demonstrate that the biological response in the northern GOA to this recent event was indeed anomalous. For example, we repeated our cluster analysis on a reduced number (n = 87) of our biological time series that spanned a 19-year period before, during, and after the 2014-2016 PMH. These longer time series confirmed that 2016-2018, in particular, is distinct from the previous 16 years (Fig. S3). Other examples include the abundance of warm-water associated zooplankton; while these increased during previous warm periods in the GOA (e.g., 2003-2006) and at least one location beginning to increase before the PMH, the magnitude and duration of increase during the PMH was unprecedented in the time series (Fig. 6a). Likewise, for over two decades, the abundance of Pacific herring, humpback whales, and nesting black-legged kittiwakes varied between periods of warm and cold, but all exhibited a precipitous decline and remained low through 2019, 5 years after the onset of the PMH (Fig. 6b). This was similarly true with the availability of sand lance and capelin, as well as with effects on reproductive success to both surface feeding and diving birds foraging from Middleton Island. The decline was notably consistent among all metrics, persisted for 5 years after the onset of the PMH (Fig. 6c), and was unlike previous years of warm and cool periods. Sockeye salmon and groundfish revenue declined during the PMH from high points prior to the heatwave, however, the low values were within the range of previous lows in the past 19 years and the decline in some groundfish species began before the PMH (Fig. 6d).Longer time series perspective.

Sockeye salmon and groundfish revenue declined during the PMH from high points prior to the heatwave, however, the low values were within the range of previous lows in the past 19 years and the decline in some groundfish species began before the PMH (Fig. 6d).</p>
        <p>The PMH was a major ecosystem perturbation corresponding to widespread effects throughout the food web, from phytoplankton to fishing communities and from intertidal to oceanic domains. The dominant pattern identified from our 187-member biological time series was an abrupt change during the PMH; over half of our time series showed either significant positive or negative responses. Such immediate responses across trophic levels through to commercial harvests are particularly notable without accounting for potential multi-year response lags among age classes and life histories of such diverse organisms. This further highlights the magnitude of this ecosystem perturbation. Collectively, this led to novel biological community patterns within 2 years of the onset of the PMH that was distinct from that prevailing at least 4-14 years prior. Whereas some metrics began trending back toward pre-PMH, these new community patterns have remained for 4 years post-onset of the PMH. The PMH was particularly strong in not only the spatial extent, duration, and magnitude of warming 19 , but also in the depth of warming and the diversity of habitats affected-ranging from offshore oceanic to intertidal waters in glacial fjords 32 . Furthermore, while water temperatures in some areas trended back toward pre-heatwave levels in years following the 2014-2016 PMH, others did not or did so only intermittently. Warm water anomalies persisted for at least 4-5 years after the beginning of the PMH, especially in the lower water column of the continental shelf (Fig. 1) 32 . Therefore, various life stages of many organisms were still experiencing anomalously warm conditions in up to five subsequent years; this likely explains the lag in returning to pre-heatwave values for the GOA community as a whole.The PMH was a major ecosystem perturbation corresponding to widespread effects throughout the food web, from phytoplankton to fishing communities and from intertidal to oceanic domains.

        <p>Biological community response during the PMH. Some patterns of response during the PMH emerged across taxa and food webs of various biological communities. Shorter-term responses occurred across all trophic levels in the form of changing phenology and cohort demographics, e.g., size, growth, and condition. Longer-term, persistent responses also were observed across all trophic levels, from phytoplankton to whales. For example, trends in several primary and secondary production metrics did not begin returning to pre-PMH levels until the second year of the 2017-2018 heatwave hiatus. Other taxa, including intertidal macroalgae, forage fish, and whale metrics showed little or no return to pre-heatwave levels, indicating carryover effects of the prolonged heatwave.Biological community response during the PMH.

        <p>Three main forage fishes of pelagic communities in the GOA (capelin, herring, sand lance) showed declines in abundance or condition during the PMH, and two species-capelin and herring-remained at low abundance levels through 2019 in the eastern GOA (Fig. 6) 33 . The decline in size and total energy content of sand lance 34 was particularly striking given that the occurrence of this species increased beginning in 2016 (Fig. 4) and during other prior warm events in the GOA 35 . While conditions in 2016 were presumably favorable for age-0 sand lance, the lower energy content and size/age truncation observed in sand lance in that year suggest this key forage fish also experienced overall negative impacts during the PMH. Indeed, by 2019, sand lance abundance still remained well below historically high values (Fig. 6). Large-scale reductions in these and other forage species in the northern GOA appeared to restrict energy transfer to upper trophic level species 33 , leading to largescale mortality events 28,36 and declines in abundance and breeding success of forage-fish-dependent salmon, groundfish, birds, and mammals (Fig. 4). Evidence points to potential top-down and bottom-up mechanisms causing mid-trophic level forage reductions during the PMH 28,37 . For example, contrary to expectations, cold water zooplankton species that typically decline in abundance during warm water periods 25,38,39 showed a weak negative or neutral to positive response (Fig. 3). The increase in zooplankton biomass overall, however, was dominated by smaller, warm water species, which likely hindered energy acquisition of zooplanktivores. The overall high biomass of warm and cold copepod species during the marine heatwave could also suggest possible reduced grazing pressure by forage fishes and other zooplanktivores due to greater consumption of those species by ectothermic predators with increased energetic demands during warm water conditions 28,37 . Declines in euphausiids, especially cool water associated species of Thysanoessa inermis and T. longipes, however, could have also limited energy transfer to upper trophic levels 40 . Overall, over half of our 187 time series showed a significant, multi-year response during the PMH; and intertidal to pelagic community metrics showed how prior disparate trends coalesced during the PMH. These results signify the magnitude of the effect of the PMH and suggest the GOA ecosystem had passed a tipping point that could no longer be buffered by the functional redundancy supporting resiliency in this system 41 .Three main forage fishes of pelagic communities in the GOA (capelin, herring, sand lance) showed declines in abundance or condition during the PMH, and two species-capelin and herring-remained at low abundance levels through 2019 in the eastern GOA (Fig. 6) 33 .

        <p>The PMH affected biological metrics across the northern GOA, but we did observe some regional differences including some stronger responses in areas east (upstream) versus west (downstream) of Cook Inlet. These areas differ hydrographically in terms of mixing regimes affecting temperature and overall productivity, with Kodiak Island area west of Cook Inlet providing thermal refuge for some cold water-associated species (e.g., capelin) 42 .The PMH affected biological metrics across the northern GOA, but we did observe some regional differences including some stronger responses in areas east (upstream) versus west (downstream) of Cook Inlet.

        <p>Changes in the GOA ecosystem during the PMH that affected groundfish and salmon stocks subsequently affected commercial fisheries and local communities. Like all marine predators, commercial fishers are constantly adapting to changes in the abundance and distribution of their target species 43,44 . While the abundance of some commercial species with lower latitude distributions (e.g., southern rock sole and juvenile sablefish) exhibited a positive response during the PMH, other species optimized to grow and survive at colder temperatures, such as cod, showed strongly negative effects 45,46 (Fig. 4). Changes in groundfish abundance were accompanied by changes in distribution 47 that can collectively affect overall fishery revenue 48 . Resilience exists in fisheries and local economies through adjustments in the supply chain (e.g., price, timing of product delivery) and fisheries diversification 49 so that individuals, communities, and commercial markets can adapt to heatwaves (Fig. 6). However, commercial species most negatively affected by the PMH in the GOA were among the highest revenue-producing fisheries representing a substantial portion of total earnings for vessels in the region. Additionally, uncertainty in recovery times associated with repeated fishery closures, rapid rates of change in target species, and damage to natural attractions (e.g., whale watching) created stress for fishing-and touristdependent communities 50,51 .Changes in the GOA ecosystem during the PMH that affected groundfish and salmon stocks subsequently affected commercial fisheries and local communities.

        <p>It is difficult to predict when or whether the GOA ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH state. Examples from the 2011 Western Australian marine heatwave indicated that after 7 years, only parts of the ecosystem were showing significant signs of recovery 52 ; whereas Chandrapavan et al. (2019) 53 reported partial recovery of a crab stock only 18 months after a marine heatwave in Australia-with the recovery linked to the return of mean summer water temperatures to below 24 Â°C. Key factors in that system that influenced recovery rate for individual species included: (1) species at the latitudinal (thermal) limit of their range; (2) spatial overlap between species distribution and the extent of the warming event; (3) the stage of the life cycle that was affected; (4) life-cycle duration and maturation time of the species affected; and (5) management intervention 52 . Similar factors were at play during the PMH and partly explain short-versus long-term responses for some metrics. The magnitude of GOA heatwave, however, resulted in broad, cross-sectional effects and lack of return to a preheatwave state across multiple trophic levels.It is difficult to predict when or whether the GOA ecosystem will return to a pre-PMH state.

        <p>Indications of return to pre-PMH levels by 2018 for time series with significant heatwave responses were strongest in metrics where shorter-term response times might be expected. However, even rocky intertidal macroalgal (Fucus) cover (Fig. 3) and whale encounter rates (Figs. 4, 6) showed some, albeit relatively minor, progress toward pre-PMH levels. Nonetheless, the GOA community through 2018 still appeared distinct from pre-PMH years (Fig. 5, Fig. S3). While additional prey and predator metrics were showing some indication in 2019 of trending back toward pre-PMH levels 33 , the re-intensification of the warming through fall 2018 and summer 2019 23,32 and the return of some lower trophic level metrics (e.g., spring chlorophyll size composition, abundance of warm water copepods) to heatwave levels in 2019 (Batten, Campbell, Holderied, Hopcroft, Kimmel, McKinstry, Strom unpubl. data), suggest caution when interpreting observations during two years of an apparent heatwave hiatus.Indications of return to pre-PMH levels by 2018 for time series with significant heatwave responses were strongest in metrics where shorter-term response times might be expected.

        <p>Future Gulf of Alaska. Recent warming events that began with the PMH are affecting most of Alaska, including the GOA, Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, with recent years among the most anomalous on record 54 . Annual sea surface temperatures in the GOA and Bering Sea through 2019 showed that half or more of the warmest 10 of the past 119 years occurred after the onset of the PMH in 2014 (i.e., all years hence, with the exception of 2017 in the GOA; University of Alaska Fairbanks, Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, ACCAP). The sustained warm water anomalies over winter that were characteristic of the PMH were of particular concern for the GOA subarctic ecosystem. Cool winter temperatures can be important to slow metabolic demands for food and maintain lipid reserves for fish 55 . Bioenergetic winter stress was also hypothesized to contribute to increased mortality of adult Pacific cod in the GOA 37 . While some species and ontogenetic stages may initially respond favorably to warm periods in the GOA, thresholds exist in positive seasonal temperaturerecruitment relationships 56 . Such changes do not appear to be gradual. For example, in the neighboring Bering Sea ecosystem, the absence of sea ice over a single winter resulted in a poleward shift in the zooplankton and fish community composition the following summer 57 .Future Gulf of Alaska.

        <p>Extreme climate events such as the PMH are an emerging driver of marine ecosystem dynamics with longterm impacts potentially greater than those of slower warming that leads to gradual reorganization and possible evolution and adaptation 58 . Models are successful in forecasting some physical aspects of events such as the PMH 59 ; however, we are still searching for mechanisms to forecast biological change in these complex ecosystems [60][61][62] . Whereas our analyses did not identify mechanisms of biological change, our results do provide a foundation on which to develop hypotheses and test mechanistic links to physical drivers of change for specific taxa, life stages, trophic levels, and thermal niches. We expect that subsequent targeted analyses will identify unifying mechanisms of change to inform ecosystem models. Long-term monitoring efforts-coupled with targeted process studies-are critically important and contribute disproportionately to this effort 63 , such that informed management decisions are compromised without dedicated long-term monitoring programs 64 . Effective communication of knowledge regarding observed and projected change is also important, not only for maintaining support for long-term monitoring programs 65 , but also to evaluate trade-offs associated with climate change adaptation and effective management of marine resources during periods of rapid climate change or extreme climate events 66 .Extreme climate events such as the PMH are an emerging driver of marine ecosystem dynamics with longterm impacts potentially greater than those of slower warming that leads to gradual reorganization and possible evolution and adaptation 58 .

Time series were neither randomly selected nor consistent in spatial extent, yet they broadly represented examples of how lower to upper trophic level ecosystem components responded during the PMH in the northern GOA.

        <p>Time series varied in length of 6 to 49 years between 1971 and 2019 (Table S1). For our primary analyses to assess GOA ecosystem response to the 2014-2016 PMH, we used all 187 time series from a 9-year period (2010-2018), providing the most years pre-PMH while minimizing missing years in time series (n = 8-9 years [91% of time series], n = 5-7 years [9% of time series]). Missing values during the 2010-2018 period were due to either more recent start of a time series or alternate year sampling; however, all time series were initiated by 2012 and included years post PMH. Additional analyses were conducted on a reduced number of time series that spanned longer time periods, 19-49 years, to assess biological trends during the 2014-2016 PMH relative to events of prior decades. Below we describe analytical approaches and general sample collection methods; see Table S1 for duration and frequency of sampling for each time series.Time series varied in length of 6 to 49 years between 1971 and 2019 (Table S1).

Metrics with skewed distributions of values varying by generally more than one order of magnitude were log transformed (log 10 (x + 1)) prior to calculating annual (geometric) means and annual means were back transformed prior to analysis. Statistically significant linear trends in seven annual time series (abundance of Steller sea lions, Eumetopias jubatus, and black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla) were removed to reduce potentially confounding patterns that could mask a PMH response.

Dynamic factor analyses were conducted in R using the multivariate autoregressive state-space modeling package 69 . We fit nine models that included three variance structures and up to three trends to the full set of 187 time series over a 9-year period that encompassed the PMH. Model variance structures that we tested included: (1) same variance and covariance (R matrix specified as 'equalvarcov'); (2) same variance and no covariance (diagonal and equal); and (3) different variance and no covariance (diagonal and unequal). We restricted the analysis to identifying a maximum of three possible trends that might include a single response (positive or negative), multiple responses (e.g., change, then return to pre-PMH), and neutral or change not associated with the timing of PMH. We applied a z-score standardization to all time series prior to analysis and followed routine methods of fitting models outlined in Holmes et al. (2018) 70 .

Each box was also split into shelf and oceanic zones. The boxes contain 1615-1698 pixels each, with shelf and oceanic boxes containing 665-1033 pixels. We excluded images with less than 30% coverage, such that all mean satellite-derived chlorophyll data included a minimum of 200 data points. Metrics used were chlorophyll biomass in each zone, and day of the year exhibiting peak chlorophyll biomass (shelf zones only).</p>
        <p>In situ measures of the size composition of chlorophyll-containing particles were integrated at 10 m intervals from the upper 50 m at stations GAK1-13 along the Seward Line. Water samples were filtered using a 20 Âµm pore-size filter over 0.7 Âµm effective pore-size filter. Pigments were extracted in 90% acetone and chlorophyll content determined by fluorometry on board the ship. The metric used for this analysis was the fraction of total chlorophyll in particles &gt; 20 Âµm (&gt; 20 Âµm chl/total chl). The data were summarized by continental shelf (GAK1-9) and slope (GAK10-13) domains.

        <p>Zooplankton samples were collected using several sampling platforms. Continuous plankton recorders towed by commercial ships transiting through the study area to ports in Alaska and Asia collected samples throughout continental shelf and oceanic waters of the GOA (Fig. 2; for more details see ref. 25 ). Research vessel-based net sampling was used to collect zooplankton samples along Line 8 in Shelikof Strait, Seward Line, in Prince William Sound (PWS), and Kachemak Bay (Fig. 2). Samples were collected during spring through fall using paired bongo nets, CalVet nets, or Multinets with 153, 202, 333, or 505 Î¼m mesh. Nets were towed to a depth of 200 m maximum (or 5-10 m above the bottom when shallower) in the GOA and to 50 m maximum (or near bottom when shallower) in Prince William Sound and Kachemak Bay (for detailed methods see ref. 39,77,78 ). For multidecade time series that used various mesh sizes over time, we included species and life history stages that were less effected by differences in mesh size 78 . Metrics for zooplankton used in our analysis included overall zooplankton abundance and size 77 , copepod community size index 79 , and the abundance of warm and cool water associated copepods; with warm species distinguished as Calanus pacificus, Clausocalanus spp., Corycaeus anglicus, Ctenocalanus spp., Mesocalanus tenuicornis, and Paracalanus parvus; and cool species as Calanus marshallae, Pseudocalanus spp., Arcartia longiremis, Oithona similis, Neocalanus cristatus, N. flemingeri, N. plumchrus, and Eucalanus bungii 38 .Zooplankton samples were collected using several sampling platforms.

        <p>Intertidal organisms. Rocky intertidal sampling was conducted at 21 sites in four regions across the northern GOA; including Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula (Kenai Fjords National Park), Kachemak Bay, and the Alaska Peninsula (Katmai National Park and Preserve). We selected a subsample of metrics representing a primary producer (macroalga Fucus distichus), predators (sea stars, Dermasterias imbricata, Evasterias troschelii, Pisaster ochraceus, and Pycnopodia helianthoides), and invertebrate prey (Pacific blue mussel, Mytilus trossulus). See ref. [82][83][84] for detailed methods and analysis of rocky and mussel bed intertidal community changes during the PMH. We used percent cover of Fucus (individuals m -2 quadrat), counts of sea stars along a 50 m Ã— 4 m transect (individuals 200 m -2 ) at rocky intertidal sites, and density of large (&gt; 20 mm) mussels (individuals m -2 quadrat) at mussel bed sites. To standardize metrics among regions, Fucus was converted to normalized anomalies of percent cover, whereas raw counts were retained for sea stars and mussels.

        <p>Marine bird abundance at sea was determined using strip transect surveys from aboard vessels conducting alongshore transects adjacent to the Alaska Peninsula and Kenai Peninsula intertidal study sites described above, from transects within PWS, and along the Seward Line between oceanographic sampling stations and transits within the region depicted in Fig. 2. We included time series of summer marine bird abundance for five species from alongshore transects adjacent to the intertidal sites: black oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani), Brachyramphus murrelets (marbled murrelet, B. marmoratus, Kittlitz's murrelet B. brevirostris), common murre, pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba), and harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus). Two time series each were used for fall (November and December) and winter (February and March) abundance of common murres and Brachyramphus murrelets in PWS. For Seward Line bird surveys in the GOA, we included time series from six species in three oceanographic domains (inner continental shelf, middle shelf, and oceanic; see Fig. 1 for boundaries); and two seasons, spring (May) and fall (September). Not all possible species-season-domain combinations were included; instead, we selected the season-domain combinations from periods when the species were most abundant. We included the species that best represented the different domains and foraging guilds, which included common murre (shelf associated diving piscivore), black-legged kittiwake (shelf associated surface feeding piscivore), sooty shearwater (Ardenna grisea; oceanic and outer shelf associated diving planktivore/ ominvore), black-footed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus; outer shelf-oceanic associated surface feeding piscivore), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis; outer shelf-oceanic associated surface feeding omnivore), and fork-tailed storm-petrel (Oceanodroma furcata; outer shelf-oceanic associated surface feeding and primarily planktivore).Marine bird abundance at sea was determined using strip transect surveys from aboard vessels conducting alongshore transects adjacent to the Alaska Peninsula and Kenai Peninsula intertidal study sites described above, from transects within PWS, and along the Seward Line between oceanographic sampling stations and transits within the region depicted in Fig. 2.
