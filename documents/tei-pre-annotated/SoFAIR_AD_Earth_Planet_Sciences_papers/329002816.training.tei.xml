        <p>Sea-level histories during the two most recent deglacial-interglacial intervals experienced significant differences 1-3 despite both periods having similar changes in global mean temperature 4,5 and forcing from greenhouse gases 6 . Although the last interglaciation (LIG) experienced stronger boreal summer insolation forcing than during the present interglaciation 7 , understanding why LIG global mean sea level may have been 6-9 m higher than present has proven particularly challenging 2 . During glacial as well as interglacial periods, extensive areas of polar ice sheets were grounded below sea level, with grounding lines and fringing ice shelves extending onto continental shelves 8 , suggesting that oceanic forcing by subsurface warming may also have contributed to ice-sheet loss [9][10][11][12] analogous to ongoing changes by the Antarctic 13,14 and Greenland 15 Climate evolution over the last two terminations shares a number of similarities (Extended Data Fig. 1). Proxy records of ocean circulation show that the last two terminations were accompanied by large reductions of the AMOC. Climate responses to these reductions show the characteristic bi-polar seesaw due to reduced northerly ocean heat transport and the weakening of the Asian monsoon due to the cooling of the Northern Hemisphere. Other similarities include an increase in the rate of sea-level rise when the AMOC begins to decrease and the occurrence of a Heinrich event during the period of reduced AMOC. Similar climate changes accompanied earlier terminations over the last 640 ka 18 , suggesting that an AMOC reduction is a characteristic feature of these periods of rapid deglaciation.Sea-level histories during the two most recent deglacial-interglacial intervals experienced significant differences 1-3 despite both periods having similar changes in global mean temperature 4,5 and forcing from greenhouse gases 6 .

        <p>There are also several notable differences between the last two terminations (Extended Data Figs. 1,2). First, proxy data suggest that the AMOC during T-II remained in a reduced state for ~7,000 years before recovering at the start of the LIG. In contrast, during T-I, the AMOC only remained weak for ~3,500 years before recovering to nearly full strength during the 1,500-year Bølling-Allerød warm interval. It then decreased again during the 1,200-year Younger Dryas cold interval, with its final recovery at the start of the present interglaciation. Second, the full T-II sealevel rise occurred during the 7-kyr sustained "one-step" period of reduced AMOC, whereas only ~50% of the T-I sea-level rise occurred during the ~6.5-kyr "two-step" period of reduced AMOC 3 (Fig. 1). Third, ice-rafted debris (IRD) suggests that Heinrich event 11 (H11), which is nearly twice as long as Heinrich event 1 (H1), was sourced from more than just the Hudson Strait Ice Stream (HSIS), which was the primary source for H1 19 .There are also several notable differences between the last two terminations (Extended Data Figs. 1,2).

        <p>A transient simulation of T-I climate used an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model version 3; NCAR CCSM3) forced by changes in insolation, CO2, ice sheets, and freshwater fluxes that, while not in full agreement with reconstructions, were designed to cause the two-step reduction of the AMOC 17 (Fig. 1k). The simulation successfully captured many aspects of the climate evolution through T-I as recorded by proxy records 17,20,21 . Among the responses to the AMOC reduction was subsurface warming throughout much of the Atlantic basin 17 (Fig. 1k,1l), which is supported by proxy temperature records from intermediate-depth (1,000-1,500 m) North Atlantic core sites 12 .A transient simulation of T-I climate used an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model version 3; NCAR CCSM3) forced by changes in insolation, CO2, ice sheets, and freshwater fluxes that, while not in full agreement with reconstructions, were designed to cause the two-step reduction of the AMOC 17 (Fig. 1k).

        <p>We used the same climate model to conduct a transient simulation that spans T-II and the LIG (140-115 ka) (Methods). We applied freshwater forcing consistent with reconstructions that reproduced the 7-kyr "one-step" reduction in the AMOC suggested by proxy records of ocean circulation (Extended Data Figs. 1,3) in order to quantify associated changes in subsurface temperatures during T-II and into the LIG and thus allow direct comparison with subsurface warming simulated for T-I. 1f,1l). Changes in GHGs and SSTs are similar during the two terminations, with increases of ~2 W m -2 from GHGs and ~2o C warming from lowlatitude Pacific SSTs, which strongly influence Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet surface mass balance 10 . Despite these similarities, sea level reached modern by the end of T-II while it remained ~50% below modern at the end of T-I (Fig. 1a,1g). Some have attributed the faster rate of sealevel rise during T-II to the greater boreal summer insolation forcing 3 , but that forcing only exceeds that of T-I after the majority (~80 m) of T-II sea-level rise had occurred (Fig. 1a, 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2). Otherwise, insolation forcing during the first 8,000 years of each termination is similar (~55 W m 2 ), whereas the associated 80 m of sea-level rise during T-II is much greater than the ~35 m during T-I.We used the same climate model to conduct a transient simulation that spans T-II and the LIG (140-115 ka) (Methods).

        <p>We attribute this contrast in sea-level response to the similar radiative forcing and temperature changes of the last two terminations to the greater subsurface warming during T-II associated with the "one-step" reduction in the AMOC than during the T-I "two-step" reduction, leading to greater oceanic forcing of marine ice-sheet margins in the North (Fig. 1e, 1k, Extended Data Fig. 4) and South (Fig. 1f, 1l, Extended Data Fig. 4) Atlantic. Moreover, the Eurasian Ice Sheet during the Penultimate Glacial Maximum (PGM, ~140 ka) was larger than during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21 ka), with most of the excess mass located in low-lying areas southsoutheast of the glaciated Barents and Kara Seas 22 that, from isostatic depression, was also marine based (Extended Data Fig. 5). We thus hypothesize that collapse of this large marine-based ice complex triggered by oceanic forcing would have also contributed to the rapid T-II sea-level rise, with the associated IRD contribution to H11 diluting the contribution from the HSIS 19 . In general, this greater FW flux from deglaciating Northern Hemisphere ice sheets during T-II provided an important positive feedback on that deglaciation through its influence on the AMOC and subsurface temperatures. than during the present interglaciation (Fig. 2c,2j). The main difference is in the higher boreal and lower austral summer insolation forcing during the LIG (Fig. 2b,2h). Modeling studies show that this forcing would cause excess mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet during the LIG, but the estimated 1-3 m of global mean sea-level equivalent (GMSLE) is too small to explain the LIG highstand, thus requiring a contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet 2 . Lower austral summer insolation forcing during the LIG (Fig. 2b), however, results in surface cooling over most of Antarctica, suggesting an important role for oceanic forcing, with warming hypothesized to originate from an AMOC reduction during the LIG 11 or from a lagged ice-sheet response to warming from a change in the strength and/or position of the Southern Ocean westerlies associated with the T-II AMOC reduction 3 . One ice-sheet model simulates up to 6.7 m of sea-level rise when specifying a uniform increase of Southern Ocean temperatures by 3 °C11 .We attribute this contrast in sea-level response to the similar radiative forcing and temperature changes of the last two terminations to the greater subsurface warming during T-II associated with the "one-step" reduction in the AMOC than during the T-I "two-step" reduction, leading to greater oceanic forcing of marine ice-sheet margins in the North (Fig. 1e, 1k, Extended Data Fig. 4) and South (Fig. 1f, 1l, Extended Data Fig. 4) Atlantic.

        <p>Our transient climate simulation shows that T-II oceanic forcing in the Southern Ocean as well as the North Atlantic continued into the early LIG (Fig. 2e, 2f, Extended Data Fig. 4). We use the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) to assess the response of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to this oceanic as well as surface forcing through T-II and into the LIG as simulated by our transient climate run (Methods). The Greenland Ice Sheet starts to deglaciate from its PGM extent when adjacent ocean temperatures begin to warm at ~137.5 ka (Fig. 1e, Fig. 3g). It reaches its present extent at 131.5 ka and then loses an additional 0.88 m GMSLE by 119.5 ka largely by oceanic forcing of those sectors of the ice sheet that remain marine based, causing drawdown of the ice-sheet interior (Fig. 3c). The majority (3.42 m) of the total sea-level rise (3.88 m) occurs between 136-129 ka (Fig. 3g), corresponding to the period of rapid rise in global mean sea level (GMSL) (Fig. 1a). Sensitivity tests in which ocean temperatures are held constant at either PGM or LIG values show that the simulated deglaciation is controlled entirely by oceanic forcing (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 6), supporting our hypothesis that oceanic forcing contributed to deglaciation of other Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (Extended Data Fig. 4).Our transient climate simulation shows that T-II oceanic forcing in the Southern Ocean as well as the North Atlantic continued into the early LIG (Fig. 2e, 2f, Extended Data Fig. 4).

        <p>Our simulations also show that the major deglacial phase of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from its PGM extent closely coincides with the onset of warming of adjacent ocean temperatures at ~137.5 ka induced by the AMOC slowdown (Fig. 1f, Fig. 3g). In particular, the ice sheet retreats to its present extent at ~128 ka, with the majority (6.25 m) of the total (6.65 m) sea-level rise also occurring during the rapid T-II rise in global sea level (Fig. 3g). Sea-level rise then slows beginning at 128 ka, followed by an acceleration starting at 126.5 ka, with a total of 2.99 m of LIG sea-level rise occurring by 116 ka (Fig. 3g). The majority of this LIG deglaciation is associated with collapse of the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) (Fig. 3e) largely in response to oceanic forcing (Extended Data Fig. 6), similar to what is suggested by observed recent changes and projected for future ice-sheet recession in this area 13,14 . This destabilization leads to retreat that continues after the period of peak oceanic forcing at a rate that is determined largely by the retrograde gradient of the bed beneath WAIS, followed by a slowing of retreat as the Southern Ocean cools (Fig. 2f).Our simulations also show that the major deglacial phase of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from its PGM extent closely coincides with the onset of warming of adjacent ocean temperatures at ~137.5 ka induced by the AMOC slowdown (Fig. 1f, Fig. 3g).

        <p>We next apply an ice-age sea-level model 23 to predict how our simulated changes in LIG ice-sheet mass would be recorded at three widely distributed sites with well-dated corals that provide minimum estimates of relative sea level (RSL) during the LIG 24,25 , and a speleothem record that bounds RSL during the same period 26 (Methods). Of the five adopted ice histories, the two (LAM and HYB) based on studies that use a significantly larger Eurasian Ice Sheet during the PGM relative to the LGM 22,27 best predict RSL histories during the LIG that are consistent with the elevation of the corals from the Bahamas, Western Australia and the Seychelles (Fig. 4a-c, Extended Data Fig. 7). However, all simulations tend to underestimate the first half (prior to 122 ka) of the LIG RSL inferred from the speleothem record in Mallorca (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 7).We next apply an ice-age sea-level model 23 to predict how our simulated changes in LIG ice-sheet mass would be recorded at three widely distributed sites with well-dated corals that provide minimum estimates of relative sea level (RSL) during the LIG 24,25 , and a speleothem record that bounds RSL during the same period 26 (Methods).

        <p>In the absence of melting of polar ice during the LIG, predictions of RSL at the Bahamas and at Mallorca would show a monotonic rise, while those at the Seychelles and Western Australia would tend to show a monotonic fall 28 . Our ice-sheet simulations, however, are characterized by excess melt from WAIS (relative to present day) that increases from 0 to 3 m GMSLE between 127 ka and 124 ka (Fig. 3g). This signal is responsible for the accentuated RSL rise over the same period in the prediction for Bahamas and Mallorca and the reversal in the RSL trend at Western Australia and the Seychelles (Fig. 4).In the absence of melting of polar ice during the LIG, predictions of RSL at the Bahamas and at Mallorca would show a monotonic rise, while those at the Seychelles and Western Australia would tend to show a monotonic fall 28 .

        <p>Our results do not account for several other processes that may have caused LIG global mean and relative sea level to have been even higher than modeled here. For example, our atmospheric modeling may underestimate surface melting around the lower-elevation margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The greater boreal summer insolation forcing during the LIG relative to the present interglaciation likely caused an even greater loss of glaciers, which today account for 0.41 m GMSLE. Warmer-than-present LIG temperatures would have caused additional thermosteric sea-level rise 5 . Finally, we note that any additional melt near the start of the LIG would change the preferred Earth models identified in our analysis (Methods). LIG RSL can also be influenced by dynamic topography due to mantle convection, introducing meter-scale displacement on these 10 5 -year timescales 29 .Our results do not account for several other processes that may have caused LIG global mean and relative sea level to have been even higher than modeled here.

        <p>In summary, several lines of evidence suggest that the greater oceanic forcing during T-II than during T-I, as simulated by our climate modeling, contributed to the more-rapid sea-level rise during T-II. First, forcing of ice-sheet surface mass balance was similar during the two terminations, indicating that an additional forcing was required to explain the differences in rates of sea-level rise. Second, our GIA modeling demonstrates that the larger PGM Eurasian ice sheet caused a significantly larger fraction of the ice-sheet bed to be below sea level, and thus be more vulnerable to oceanic forcing, than during T-I. Third, our ice-sheet modeling shows that &gt;85% of the volume loss of the PGM Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to their present sizes occurs in response to oceanic forcing during T-II. Although additional modeling of the deglaciation of the former NH ice sheets during T-II will be required to further support this hypothesis, our ice-sheet modeling does show that oceanic forcing was the primary driver of excess ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets during the LIG. Our sea-level predictions demonstrate that the modeled 4 m of GMSLE from LIG deglaciation of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets may explain much of the LIG RSL at intermediate-and far-field sites when GIA from T-II deglaciation is included, although additional melt is required to fully reconcile these data.In summary, several lines of evidence suggest that the greater oceanic forcing during T-II than during T-I, as simulated by our climate modeling, contributed to the more-rapid sea-level rise during T-II.

        <p>System Model version 3 (CCSM3) in T31 resolution 30 for the transient simulation of the penultimate deglaciation and last interglaciation (LIG) from 140 to 120 ka. CCSM3 was used in the TraCE-21K transient simulation of the past 21,000 years spanning the last deglaciation and the current interglaciation 17,21,31 . The transient simulation of the penultimate deglaciation was initialized with a 600-year equilibrium simulation of the penultimate glacial maximum that branched off the TraCE-21K last glacial maximum (LGM) simulation with orbital configuration 7 and greenhouse gas contribution (CO2) for 140 kyr 32 . The transient simulation of penultimate deglaciation with CCSM3 was integrated from 140 ka to 129 ka with changing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations 32 , Earth's orbit 7 , and continental ice sheets based on ICE-5G 33 but with the timing of the corresponding sea-level rise adjusted to closely follow the Waelbroeck et al. 1 and Grant et al. 34 sea-level reconstructions for the penultimate deglaciation (Extended Data Figs. 2,3). We note that our sea-level modeling suggests that the sizes of the penultimate glacial maximum Northern Hemisphere ice sheets differed from the LGM and thus our climate modelling does no account for these important difference between the two terminations. Further climate modeling is thus needed to assess how these differences may have affected atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic Ocean and the AMOC.System Model version 3 (CCSM3) in T31 resolution 30 for the transient simulation of the penultimate deglaciation and last interglaciation (LIG) from 140 to 120 ka.

        <p>Ice-sheet modeling. We use version 0.7.1 of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM), in which the dynamical core superposes velocity fields from the shallow shelf and shallow ice approximations across the entire domain. Fast flow ("streaming") of grounded ice is enabled by plastic failure of subglacial sediments, which depends on a prescribed but spatially-variable till friction angle, representing sediment strength and its degree of saturation. The till friction angle is based primarily on topography, so that deeper areas have lower friction angles. This mimics the effect of weaker sediments accumulating in deeper basins. The parameterization follows the form, phi min / phi max / elevation min / elevation max, in which the phi min is the friction angle applied below elevation min, phi max is the friction angle applied above elevation max, and values in between are linearly interpolated. For our Greenland simulations we prescribe values of 10 / 30 / -300 / 300, and for Antarctica 6 / 30 / -700 / -100. These values are based on, but modified from, previous work (Aschwanden et al. 35 for Greenland; Golledge et al. 36 for Antarctica), but these values are uncertain. Our values were chosen following exploratory simulations that sought to best capture the broad-scale geometric and dynamic features of the ice sheets.Ice-sheet modeling. We use version 0.7.1 of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM), in which the dynamical core superposes velocity fields from the shallow shelf and shallow ice approximations across the entire domain. Fast flow ("streaming") of grounded ice is enabled by plastic failure of subglacial sediments, which depends on a prescribed but spatially-variable till friction angle, representing sediment strength and its degree of saturation. The till friction angle is based primarily on topography, so that deeper areas have lower friction angles. This mimics the effect of weaker sediments accumulating in deeper basins. The parameterization follows the form, phi min / phi max / elevation min / elevation max, in which the phi min is the friction angle applied below elevation min, phi max is the friction angle applied above elevation max, and values in between are linearly interpolated.

        <p>Sediment strength evolves dynamically depending on the basal ice temperature. Where ice is sufficiently thick to allow basal melting, meltwater weakens the substrate until driving stresses exceed till cohesion. Failure of the substrate that results in acceleration of overlying ice follows a pseudo-plastic law 37,38 , such that a small increase in stress above the shear strength of the substrate leads to an increasing velocity response. This ultimately thins the ice, which reduces the gravitational driving stress and results in a deceleration of the ice sheet. The cyclic behavior of ice streams that occurs as a consequence of this mechanism is described in more detail elsewhere 39 .Sediment strength evolves dynamically depending on the basal ice temperature.

        <p>PISM uses a sub-grid grounding line scheme 40 in which the interpolation of sub-ice shelf melt across the grounded to floating transition may be turned on or off. When turned on, the scheme tends to accelerate ice-sheet retreat in marine basins, whereas when it is off, the scheme produces a slower response 36 . This difference in behavior results in differences in retreat rates, but equilibrium states (for example, ice volume) are less affected. In our experiments we investigated both approaches, and found that interpolating sub-shelf melt across the grounding line produced simulations that were most closely in keeping with geological constraints for Termination I (T-I) (see below).PISM uses a sub-grid grounding line scheme 40 in which the interpolation of sub-ice shelf melt across the grounded to floating transition may be turned on or off.

        <p>We run separate simulations for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, both at 20-km resolution. To drive our ice-sheet model, we use output climatologies from the transient CCSM3 simulations described above for T-I and Termination II (T-II). Atmospheric outputs are applied as anomalies to present-day air temperature and precipitation fields 42,43 , in the same manner as employed previously 44 . We employ a positive-degree day (PDD) model to translate temperatures above freezing into surface melt, of which 60% remains in the snowpack as a consequence of refreezing during percolation. The proportion of refreezing that takes place even under present conditions is difficult to constrain precisely 45 so we use a uniform value both for the control and perturbation experiments, in order to minimize the effects of this parameterization. That is, differences in the simulation outputs are unlikely to arise from uncertainty in this aspect of model parameterization.We run separate simulations for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, both at 20-km resolution.

        <p>During our model tuning process, we explored a wide range of degree-day values (from 1 mm o C -1 day -1 up to 64 mm o C -1 day -1 ) independently for both snow and ice. We tried the more usual melt threshold of 273 K and the lower value of 270 K following van den Broeke et al. 46 . The latter method yields more widespread melt, mimicking the possible melt arising from short-wave radiation under sub-freezing conditions, and thus degree-day factors are typically lower (van den Broeke et al., 2010). We also allow for stochastic variability in daily temperatures using a zeromean white noise component whose standard deviation is set at 5 K. Although the choice of PDD parameters did exert some control on the geometry of the evolving ice mass, the basic shape of the ice sheet evolved in a similar manner regardless of either the melt forcing or the glaciological parameterization, suggesting that the dominant control on ice-sheet geometry is the climate forcing from the GCM. Recent work has shown that our simulations of surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland Ice Sheet under the high boreal summer insolation of the LIG may be sensitive to climate model resolution and SMB model type (i.e., PDD, surface energy balance) 47 .During our model tuning process, we explored a wide range of degree-day values (from 1 mm o C -1 day -1 up to 64 mm o C -1 day -1 ) independently for both snow and ice.

        <p>Oceanic fields for temperature and salinity at 500 m depth were used as inputs to a thermodynamic ocean model that calculates basal melt from salt and heat-flux gradients across the ice/ocean interface, according to the scheme described in 48 . As with the atmospheric variables, we apply the oceanic fields as anomalies from a present-day ocean configuration that for Antarctica is tuned to reproduce observed melt-rate patterns 49 . Since such constraints are not currently available for Greenland, we use a spatially uniform melt factor instead, which is iteratively refined so that both LGM and present-day ice-sheet extents are reproduced (see below).

        <p>With the model set-up as described above, we ran a series of time-evolving experiments that first focused on T-I, rather than T-II. The rationale for this approach is that substantial geological data exist with which to constrain the evolving ice-sheet geometry through the last deglaciation, whereas there are few constraints for the preceding T-II. Therefore, in order to optimize our parameter settings, we undertook &gt;500 experiments of T-I for both ice sheets until a good fit to empirical constraints was found. For Antarctica, our guiding constraints are that the ice sheet at the LGM, immediately prior to T-I, should occupy the majority of the continental shelf, and have an ice-volume excess above present that is within the range of 5.6-14.5 m represented by previous simulations [52][53][54][55] . Furthermore, we required that the evolution of the simulated ice sheet must reproduce the glacial maximum thickening of West Antarctica and thinning of East Antarctica inferred from ice-core analyses 55 , and exhibit a pattern of mass loss that is consistent with geologically inferred deglacial changes in ice discharge 56 . In Greenland, geological constraints on the offshore extent of the LGM ice sheet are sparse, but the ice volume excess is thought to have been in the range 2 -5 m global mean sea level equivalent 57,58 . We use this range as our target (Extended Data Fig. 8). Finally, both ice sheets are required to reproduce present-day grounded ice extent and volume as closely as possible at the end of the T-I simulations.With the model set-up as described above, we ran a series of time-evolving experiments that first focused on T-I, rather than T-II.

        <p>Once this phase of parameter optimization is complete, we run our experiments for T-II using the exact same settings, changing only the input climatology based on outputs from CCSM3. This dual approach allows for the robust simulation of a period, such as T-II, for which little data exist to constrain outputs. In addition, this methodology allows for the direct comparison of model outputs for the two periods, allowing any differences to be attributed solely to the imposed climate forcing rather than to uncertainties in the modelling procedure. A novelty of our ice-sheet simulations compared to previous studies 59,60 is that we use a fully evolving T-I experiment to constrain our model parameterizations. This includes components such as degree-day factors for the PDD scheme. For Greenland, we run an ensemble of tuning experiments that explore a range of snow and ice melt factors as well as ice-flow enhancement coefficients (Extended Data Fig. 8). By then selecting the parameterization that at the end of the T-I simulation most closely reproduces present-day ice volume and geometry we ensure that the surface melt fields we generate are realistic. We then apply this setup to our T-II experiments. Our annual temperature range is defined by the CCSM3 outputs. However, we also experimented with duplicate simulations in which we modified our Greenland climatologies to incorporate summer temperatures from Fausto et al. 42 . These simulations resulted in only minor differences in mass change, suggesting that in our experiments, atmospheric forcing plays a lesser role than oceanic forcing (Extended Data Figs. 6,9). This is supported by experiments in which we also explored alternative grounding line schemes to make the ice sheets either more or less sensitive to ocean temperature change. In the less sensitive experiments, the ice sheet failed to advance sufficiently far offshore, and was thus incompatible with geological constraints.Once this phase of parameter optimization is complete, we run our experiments for T-II using the exact same settings, changing only the input climatology based on outputs from CCSM3.

Given that corals provide a minimum bound on sea level, our metric for fit for these data was the number of coral records that any specific RSL prediction bounded from above.

As an indication of performance, Extended Data Fig. 7 shows predictions from the full suite of simulations that satisfy the following criteria: (1) all coral data from Western Australia and Bahamas, with the exception of the earliest datum at the latter site (at ~131 ka), fall below the prediction; and (2) the prediction at the Seychelles falls above all three coral records at an elevation of ~4 m. The various lines on the figure represent the different Earth models for each ice history that satisfy these constraints.

This is reflected in Fig. 4 in the main text, where the simulation highlighted in each frame is the result for a distinct Earth model. This variation is justified by the fact that the Earth's mantle is subject to large amplitude variations in viscoelastic structure and so it would be unexpected if the sea-level response at each of the three sites preferred the same Earth model.None of the 1685 simulations (i.e., our sampling of 337 Earth models and 5 ice histories) were successful in bounding all coral records from above.

        <p>Note that the number of simulations that satisfy our plotting criterion for the Bahamas increases as one moves to ice histories with larger Eurasian ice cover at the PGM (i.e., from the WAE to the COL results), but the number of simulations that satisfy the criteria for the Seychelles decreases in the same sense. While not apparent from Extended Data Fig. 7, the predicted highstand at Seychelles increases as one considers Earth models with progressively thinner elastic lithospheres (see Ref. 28, Fig. 9A), and the simulations that predict RSL highstands above the Seychelles records are those based on a lithospheric thickness of 30 km (as in Fig. 4 of the main text) or, in a couple of cases for the WAE ice history, 50 km.

        <p>First, none of the simulations that yield RSL above all the coral elevations at Seychelles also satisfy the geological constraints at the Bahamas. Second, since the predicted highstand at the Seychelles is sensitive to the adopted lithospheric thickness, there is a trade-off between the preferred value of this parameter and the level of excess melting during the LIG. That is, increasing polar ice sheet melting above the ~4 m GMSL equivalent adopted in the simulations in Extended Data Fig. 7, would increase the range of lithospheric thickness that would satisfy the Seychelles coral record, and thus bring the inference into better accord with other GIA-based estimates of this Earth model parameter.First, none of the simulations that yield RSL above all the coral elevations at Seychelles also satisfy the geological constraints at the Bahamas.

        <p>This issue may also have relevance in regard to the results for Mallorca (Extended Data Fig. 7) where simulations are only plotted if the misfit between the GIA predictions and the speleothem observations is within 50% of the minimum misfit achieved in all simulations. In this case, fewer of the simulations provide a reasonable fit to the speleothem record as one considers ice histories with progressively larger volumes over Eurasia at PGM and, indeed, no simulations based on the COL ice history satisfy our plotting criterion. However, regardless of the adopted ice history, none of the simulations fit the highstand constraints before 125 ka. Bringing the GIA predictions in Extended Data Fig. 7 into accord with the Mallorca observations would require additional excess melting that is limited to the earliest phase of the LIG.This issue may also have relevance in regard to the results for Mallorca (Extended Data Fig. 7) where simulations are only plotted if the misfit between the GIA predictions and the speleothem observations is within 50% of the minimum misfit achieved in all simulations.

Here we evaluate the evidence for warming over the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Last Interglaciation (LIG). This supports our climate model simulation that while the LIG atmosphere was warmer than pre-Industrial, it largely remained below freezing and did not lead to significant mass loss from surface melting.Evidence for warming over the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Last Interglaciation.

        <p>Regarding the reconstructed LIG temperatures at the NEEM 65 and GISP2 66 ice-core sites, there is uncertainty in which dδ 18 Oice/dT relationship should be used to reconstruct LIG temperatures, and this uncertainty is exacerbated when applying the modern dδ 18 Oice-dT relationship to past climates, where differences in orbital forcing, moisture transport pathways, ice-sheet topography, and sea-ice extent can change the relationship [67][68][69][70][71][72] . To illustrate some of these uncertainties, we have compared our simulated temperatures for the NEEM and GISP2 icecore sites with the temperature reconstructions for these sites based on δ 18 Oice (Extended Data Fig. 10). These reconstructions span the interval 127-120 ka, which is the warmest interval in the ice-core records for the LIG suggested by this proxy. The published reconstructed temperatures for GISP2 (blue symbols on upper panel) 66,73 and NEEM (dark blue line on lower panel) 65 are based on the relation dδ 18 Oice/dT = ~0.5‰ C -1 which is derived from Greenland ice-core sites elsewhere 74 . During the LIG, the precipitation-weighted δ 18 O is likely biased to summer months rather than mean annual temperature (van de Berg et al., 2013), so we compare this reconstruction with our simulated summer temperature (JJA) (grey line on each panel). This suggests that our simulated JJA temperatures are underestimating the mean of the reconstructions by 4-5 o C. This difference is reduced when we account for our simulated ice-surface lowering of ~200 m at NEEM and ~400 m at GISP2 (see Fig. 3C) and assume the lapse rate of 7.5 o C km -1 used by Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 , thus placing our results within the published uncertainties of the reconstructions (green line on each panel).Regarding the reconstructed LIG temperatures at the NEEM 65 and GISP2 66 ice-core sites, there is uncertainty in which dδ 18 Oice/dT relationship should be used to reconstruct LIG temperatures, and this uncertainty is exacerbated when applying the modern dδ 18 Oice-dT relationship to past climates, where differences in orbital forcing, moisture transport pathways, ice-sheet topography, and sea-ice extent can change the relationship [67][68][69][70][71][72] .

        <p>However, following the publication of Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 , Masson-Delmotte et al. 75 established that the dδ 18 Oice/dT relation at the NEEM site is ~1.1‰ C -1 , suggesting that the NEEM and GISP2 LIG summer temperatures are about half of the originally published values based on the Vinther et al. 74 dδ 18 Oice/dT relation (red symbols on upper panel, red line on lower panel).However, following the publication of Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 , Masson-Delmotte et al. 75 established that the dδ 18 Oice/dT relation at the NEEM site is ~1.1‰ C -1 , suggesting that the NEEM and GISP2 LIG summer temperatures are about half of the originally published values based on the Vinther et al. 74 dδ 18 Oice/dT relation (red symbols on upper panel, red line on lower panel).</p>

        <p>Landais et al. 76 used δ 15 N from the NEEM core to reconstruct temperatures that were 8.5 o + 2.5 o C warmer during the LIG compared to preindustrial (PI). However, the δ 15 N reconstruction represents annual temperature whereas the δ 18 Oice temperatures are biased to the summer, which is the critical season for influencing changes in surface mass balance through melting. The two temperature reconstructions are thus not directly comparable. Moreover, Landais et al. 76 identify "large uncertainties" (p. 1944) in their temperature reconstruction, including in the firn model used, in the assumed accumulation rates, and in the potential influence of surface melt on firn depth.Landais et al. 76 used δ 15 N from the NEEM core to reconstruct temperatures that were 8.5 o + 2.5 o C warmer during the LIG compared to preindustrial (PI).

        <p>We thus conclude that when using the most suitable temperature calibration for the icecore sites and within the uncertainties of the ice-core proxy reconstructions, our climate model successfully captures the LIG summer (JJA) temperature anomaly relative to pre-Industrial at NEEM and GISP2. Consistent with this model-data agreement for warmer LIG JJA temperatures, we find that the LIG surface mass balance of the GrIS is more negative than present day (Extended Data Fig. 9). Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 stated "during our NEEM field campaigns (2007-2012), the mean surface air temperature in July reached -5.4 o C." However, Box 77 reported the average JJA temperature for 2007-2012 at NEEM site as -10.9 + 0.3 o C, suggesting that Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 are reporting a maximum July temperature value during their period of record rather than climatology.We thus conclude that when using the most suitable temperature calibration for the icecore sites and within the uncertainties of the ice-core proxy reconstructions, our climate model successfully captures the LIG summer (JJA) temperature anomaly relative to pre-Industrial at NEEM and GISP2.

        <p>But the JJA temperature that matters for comparing to the LIG is the pre-Industrial, which Box 77 found to be -12.6 + 0.6 o C for 1840-1870 (period of record closest to pre-Industrial). (Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 compared to the average of the last millennium.) Thus, even if the Dahl-Jensen et al. 65 LIG temperature reconstruction is correct (7.5+1.8 o C warmer than the mean of the past millennium), average LIG summer temperatures would still be well below freezing (~ -5 o C). More likely, however, they are even further below freezing when using the dδ 18 Oice/dT relation established for the NEEM site 75 , i.e., 3.6+0.7 o C warmer than the mean of the past millennium, with average LIG summer temperatures thus being -9 o C.But the JJA temperature that matters for comparing to the LIG is the pre-Industrial, which Box 77 found to be -12.6 + 0.6 o C for 1840-1870 (period of record closest to pre-Industrial).

        <p>The evidence for surface melt at the NEEM ice core site is based on: (1) a low-resolution record showing that out of 73 samples, seven have elevated CH4 and N2O during the interval 118-127 ka, and (2) a high-resolution CH4 record that suggests five melt events in the 123.5-122.5 ka interval, or one every 200 years 65,78 . Noble gases that were measured at the times of four of the five elevated CH4 events in the high-resolution record confirm melting at these times 78 . This alone makes it clear that these were infrequent periods of melting rather than continuous melting throughout the LIG. According to Anais Orsi (personal communication, March, 2019), during a melt event, such as the 2012 event 79 , the melt percolates and refreezes in the top 1m of the firn, often in many layers, so one melt event may be represented by more than one melt layer. Moreover, although the noble gas results clearly identify four periods of enhanced melting, one cannot exclude the possibility that each sample represents a single 2012-like melt event.The evidence for surface melt at the NEEM ice core site is based on: (1) a low-resolution record showing that out of 73 samples, seven have elevated CH4 and N2O during the interval 118-127 ka, and (2) a high-resolution CH4 record that suggests five melt events in the 123.5-122.5 ka interval, or one every 200 years 65,78 .

        <p>In summary, ice-core proxies suggest that Greenland LIG temperatures were warmer than present, but constraining the amount of warming from these proxies remains uncertain. However, even the highest estimates of warming still suggest that average JJA temperatures remained well below freezing relative to pre-Industrial, and based on the more-appropriate δ 18 Oice-temperature calibration from Masson-Delmotte et al. 75 , are in good agreement with our simulated temperatures for the ice-core sites. Consistent with this model-data agreement for warmer LIG JJA temperatures, we find that the LIG surface mass balance of the GrIS is more negative then present day. Rare episodes of melting occurred, but while their frequency may increase under higher mean temperatures and insolation, such as is recorded in the Holocene section of the GISP2 ice core 80 , we conclude that with a frequency of perhaps only one melt event every 200 years, they had a negligible influence on long-term surface mass balance, and average summer temperatures at the NEEM site otherwise remained well below freezing during the LIG.In summary, ice-core proxies suggest that Greenland LIG temperatures were warmer than present, but constraining the amount of warming from these proxies remains uncertain.

We did not include additional freshwater (FW) forcing after 129.5 ka, but we show here that the FW fluxes from our modeled mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (GrIS and AIS) after 129.5 ka (during the LIG) were too small to have influenced the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) or Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) formation. Since global sea level reached modern at 129-130 ka, and our modeled AMOC resumes at 129.5 ka, we only consider the FW fluxes from the GrIS and AIS since 129.5 ka.Ice Sheets on ocean circulation during the last interglaciation.

Also shown are the reconstructed temperatures using the dδ 18 Oice/dT relation established for the NEEM site (~1.1‰ C -1 ) 75 (red symbols, 1 sigma uncertainty), suggesting that the GISP2 LIG summer temperatures are about half of the originally published values based on the Vinther et al. 74 dδ 18 Oice/dT relation and in good agreement with our model results. (b) The simulated JJA temperature (grey line) and lapse-rate corrected JJA temperature (green line) compared to reconstructed temperatures for the NEEM ice-core site (dark blue line, gray shading is uncertainty) 65 based on the relation dδ 18 Oice/dT = ~0.5‰ C -1 which is derived from Greenland ice-core sites elsewhere 74 .
