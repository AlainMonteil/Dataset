        <p>Twelve actual evaporation datasets are evaluated for their ability to improve the performance of the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM). The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (
            <rs type="software">GLEAM</rs> v
            <rs type="version">3.2a</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">GLEAM</rs> v

            <rs type="software">GLEAM</rs> v
            <rs type="version">3.3b</rs>), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012.
        </p>
        <p>Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflowonly calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial biasaccounting strategy ( + 29%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy ( + 26%) and the pixel-wise strategy ( + 24%), while the basin-average strategy ( + 20%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage ( + 11%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture ( + 6%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture ( + 89%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v
            <rs type="version">3.3a</rs> and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.

        <p>Assessing the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological processes is the crux of effective water resource management. Global warming is expected to intensify (i.e., accelerate) the hydrological cycle, thus increasing or decreasing evaporation depending on places ( Donat et al., 2016 ;Famiglietti and Rodell, 2013 ;Huntington, 2006 ). Minimum air temperature tial in (semi-)arid catchments, where evaporation represents the dominant outgoing water flux. In such environments, a classical hydrological model calibration on streamflow alone could lead to important model biases. More generally, for catchments with strong anthropogenic influences on the water cycle (e.g., irrigation schemes, dams, etc.) or in data scarce regions, the inclusion of evaporation data in model calibration has the potential to better constrain a hydrological model rather than streamflow alone ( Becker et al., 2019 ;Jiang and Wang, 2019 ). Accordingly, calibrating hydrological models solely based on streamflow is not sufficient to guarantee an accurate representation of the hydrological system because streamflow is the result of several inter-linked processes, thereby it masks spatial heterogeneity ( Tobin and Bennett, 2017 ;Wambura et al., 2018 ). This limitation in model implementation has been overcome by the advent of multivariate calibration techniques using satellite-based datasets, which offers models a chance for better spatial heterogeneity ( Efstratiadis and Koutsoyiannis, 2010 ;Rakovec et al., 2016 ).Assessing the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological processes is the crux of effective water resource management.

        <p>In the quest to improve process representation in hydrological models, large scale distributed hydrological modelling faces the challenging requirement of spatially explicit observational datasets for model setup and performance evaluation ( Clark et al., 2017 ;Fatichi et al., 2016 ;Hrachowitz and Clark, 2017 ). Correspondingly, Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) and reanalysis datasets of various hydrological processes have been used as input data ( Beck et al., 2017 ;Maggioni and Massari, 2018 ) or as calibration and evaluation data for hydrological models ( Koppa and Gebremichael, 2020 ;McCabe et al., 2017 ). Evaporation estimates from SRS are increasingly used in multivariate calibration of hydrological models. Because it is a key indicator of surface water availability, evaporation is an essential source of information for better constraining the spatiotemporal representation of processes in hydrological models ( Bai and Liu, 2018 ;Cui et al., 2019 ;Talsma et al., 2018 ). The increasing availability and diversity of gridded evaporation datasets has triggered many evaluation and comparison studies ( Long et al., 2014 ;Vinukollu et al., 2011b ), which highlight significant differences between the datasets and thereby indicate underlying uncertainty in the evaporation estimates ( Baik et al., 2018 ;López et al., 2017 ). The uncertainty stems from the strong variability of bio-geophysical variables that drive evaporation (e.g., albedo, net radiation, surface roughness and temperature) and the diversity of the model structures, model parametrizations and input datasets used to estimate evaporation ( Badgley et al., 2015 ;Wang and Dickinson, 2012 ;Zhang et al., 2020 ). Therefore, the choice and use of SRS evaporation data in hydrological modelling should be done cautiously, particularly in catchments with strong anthropogenic influences ( Senkondo et al., 2019 ;Yang et al., 2016 ). Generally, the following four approaches are adopted to evaluate gridded evaporation products:In the quest to improve process representation in hydrological models, large scale distributed hydrological modelling faces the challenging requirement of spatially explicit observational datasets for model setup and performance evaluation ( Clark et al., 2017 ;Fatichi et al., 2016 ;Hrachowitz and Clark, 2017 ).

        <p>Assessing the uncertainty of evaporation estimates at large-scale is challenging due to the limited availability of ground-based measurements ( Bhattarai et al., 2019 ;Ceperley et al., 2017 ). The uncertainty in evaporation varies in space and according to climate regions ( Blatchford et al., 2020 ;Vinukollu et al., 2011a ). In evaluating the contribution of gridded evaporation datasets to hydrological model calibration, some limitations can be denoted in previous studies. Most previous studies only use or compare few evaporation datasets (e.g., Kunnath-Poovakka et al., 2016 ;Vervoort et al., 2014 ), and rarely (if any) investigate the use of reanalysis datasets (i.e., retrospective analysis; cf. Bosilovich et al., 2008 ), which are an important source of spatial evaporation estimates ( Feng et al., 2019 ). Usually, a lumped or semi-distributed model is used (e.g., Odusanya et al., 2019 ;Rientjes et al., 2013 ), which does not harness the full potential of the gridded evaporation datasets that is their spatial patterns ( Armstrong et al., 2019 ;Stisen et al., 2018 ). Most studies do not test different model calibration strategies, with some exceptions that use a semi-distributed model (e.g., Herman et al., 2018 ;Rajib et al., 2018 ). Finally, a few studies use a bias-insensitive metric to focus only on the spatial patterns of gridded evaporation products ( Dembélé et al., 2020a ;Koch et al., 2018 ).Assessing the uncertainty of evaporation estimates at large-scale is challenging due to the limited availability of ground-based measurements ( Bhattarai et al., 2019 ;Ceperley et al., 2017 ).

        <p>This study aims to fill current knowledge gaps by evaluating the utility of nine satellite-based (prognostic and diagnostic) and three reanalysis evaporation datasets in improving the performance of a distributed hydrological model using four distinct calibration strategies. This study does not intend to quantify the intrinsic accuracy of the evaporation products nor determine whether a product is better than the others in terms of absolute values. Rather it strives to evaluate their ability to improve the simulations of a distributed hydrological model when used as a calibration variable. Besides the high number and diversity of gridded evaporation datasets evaluated, the novelty of this study is the implementation of four distinct model calibration strategies with a fully distributed hydrological model, the evaluation of the model responses with multiple variables (i.e., streamflow, soil moisture and terrestrial water storage) to test evaporation error propagation on other hydrological processes, and the application of the experiment in a large basin spread across four eco-climatic zones with considerable anthropogenic influence.

        <p>The transboundary Volta River Basin (VRB) is shared among six countries of West Africa (i.e., Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Mali, Benin and Côte d'Ivoire) and covers approximately 415,600 km 2 ( Fig. 1 ). Most of the basin lies below 400 m a.s.l. with a predominantly flat topography ( Fig. 1 b). The Volta River flows north-south over a distance of 1,850 km and drains into the Atlantic Ocean at the Gulf of Guinea after transiting through Lake Volta (8,502 km 2 ) formed by the Akosombo dam (7.94 Mm 3 ) ( Dembélé et al., 2019 ;Dembélé et al., 2020a ;Williams et al., 2016 ).

        <p>The VRB extends over four eco-climatic zones (i.e., Sahelian, Sudano-Sahelian, Sudanian and Guinean) characterized by increasing vegetation density and receiving increasing precipitation from north to south ( Fig. 1 a; Table 1 ). The information provided in Table 1 is obtained from the global aridity index database ( Trabucco and Zomer, 2018 ), and the WFDEI meteorological data (see Table 2 ; Weedon et al., 2014 ) for the period 1979-2016. Fig. 1 The climate is driven by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and varies from sub-humid in the south to semi-arid in the north ( Dembélé et al., 2019 ;FAO/GIEWS, 1998 ;Mul et al., 2015 ). Actual evaporation varies between 70% and 90% of annual rainfall in the basin.The VRB extends over four eco-climatic zones (i.e., Sahelian, Sudano-Sahelian, Sudanian and Guinean) characterized by increasing vegetation density and receiving increasing precipitation from north to south ( Fig. 1 a; Table 1 ).

        <p>The fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) is a conceptual model that simulates dominant hydrological processes (e.g., evaporation, soil moisture and discharge) per grid cell in the modelling domain ( Kumar et al., 2013 ;Samaniego et al., 2010 ). Samaniego et al. (2011) provide a schematic representation of the processes accounted for in mHM. A multiscale routing model based on the Muskingum-Cunge method ( Cunge, 1969 ) is used for the routing of the total grid-generated runoff through the river network ( Thober et al., 2019 ). The sub-grid variability of the basin physical characteristics (e.g., soil texture, land cover) is accounted for with a multiscale parameter regionalization technique ( Samaniego et al., 2017 ). The model parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, soil porosity) are linked to the basin physical characteristics via pedo-transfer functions and global parameters. Thirty-six global parameters (cf. Pokhrel et al., 2008 ) are tuned during model calibration for this study (Table S6). mHM was found reliable for modelling hydrological processes in the VRB ( Dembélé et al., 2020a ).

In addition to in-situ streamflow, SRS datasets of soil moisture and terrestrial water storage are used to evaluate the model performance after calibration.

The blended product of both passive and active microwave products is used here ( Gruber et al., 2017 ;Liu et al., 2012 ;Wagner et al., 2012 ).

The ensemble arithmetic mean of different solutions from three processing centers (i.e., Center for Space Research at University of Texas, Geoforschungs Zentrum Potsdam and Jet Propulsion Laboratory) is used in this study because it has been shown to be more effective in reducing noise in the Earth's gravity signal than the individual solutions ( Sakumura et al., 2014 ).The quality control and the gap-filling of the streamflow data are described by Dembélé et al.

The versions v3.3a and v3.2a are produced with reanalysis, satellite and gauge-based datasets, while the versions v3.3b and v3.2b are mainly produced with satellite datasets. Considerable differences can be observed both in the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns of the 12 gridded evaporation datasets across the climatic zones in the VRB ( Figs. 2 and3 ).

Then, the contribution of evaporation datasets in improving hydrological model calibration is tested by simultaneously constraining the model with streamflow and each of the twelve gridded evaporation datasets using four calibration strategies for each (Fig. 4) . Therefore, 48 scenarios (i.e., 12 datasets times 4 calibration strategies) are developed and compared to the benchmark calibration to evaluate the impact of different calibration strategies on model performance. The dynamically dimensioned search algorithm ( Tolson and Shoemaker, 2007 ) is used for parameter estimation, using 5,000 iterations for each of the 48 scenarios and for the benchmark model calibration.

        <p>For Q , the benchmark model (i.e., Q-only) yields a median E KG of 0.69. In the multivariate calibration scenarios (i.e., Q + E a ), the E KG of Q varies between 0.42 for SEBS with case PW to 0.73 for CMRSET with case SP. The best multivariate calibration strategy is the case SB with an average E KG of 0.68 and 75% of the evaporation datasets producing a higher model performance than the benchmark, followed by case SP ( E KG = 0.67), case PW ( E KG = 0.63) and case BA ( E KG = 0.60). The top 3 best evaporation datasets for the average E KG of Q over the calibration strategies are GLEAM v3.2b ( E KG = 0.71), GLEAM v3.3b ( E KG = 0.71) and GLEAM v
            <rs type="version">3</rs>.3a ( E KG = 0.70), while the worst are ALEXI ( E KG = 0.61), SEBS ( E KG = 0.56) and ERA5 ( E KG = 0.51). The decrease in the model performance for Q in the multivariate calibration might be an artifact caused by equifinality (i.e., non-uniqueness of model parameters; Beven, 2006 ;Savenije, 2001 ) that occurred with the Q-only calibration, which gives more degrees of freedom for constraining the model parameter space Dembélé et al. (2020a) . In fact, Figures S68-S71 show that the high performance for Q achieved with the Q-only calibration is obtained at the expense of poor performance for other hydrological processes, while the multivariate calibrations with Q + E a result in parameter sets that provide equivalent model performance for Q but higher model performance for S t and S u . These results support the findings of Dembélé et al. (2020a) , thereby confirming the pitfalls of the Q-only calibration ( Bouaziz et al., 2020 ;Stisen et al., 2018 ).

However, case SB ( E SP = 0.0) has the highest average performance across the evaporation datasets, while case BA ( E SP = -0.04) has the lowest performance.

        </p>
        <p>In general, it is observed that the model performances for S t and S u improve for most of the multivariate calibration scenarios. Among the multivariate calibration strategies, case SB gives the best results considering the average model performance for all variables ( Q, S t and S u ). In Fig. 7 b, the highest average relative change in model performance by multivariate calibration strategies as compared to the Q-only calibration is obtained with case SB is ( + 29%), followed by case SP ( + 26%), case PW ( + 24%) and case BA ( + 20%). Consequently, all grid-based model calibration strategies outperform the basin-average calibration (case BA), which gives the lowest average model performance. These results highlight the value of calibrating hydrological models on the full extent of gridded evaporation datasets. It is noted that, in most of the scenarios, calibrating the model only on the spatial patterns (case SP) of the evaporation datasets, thereby ignoring their absolute values, improves the predictive skill of the model with a higher performance than that of case Q and case BA ( Fig. 6 ). With these findings, case SP (i.e., only spatial patterns of evaporation datasets) can be preferred to case SB (i.e., absolute values of evaporation datasets) for the calibration of hydrological models because the propagation of the errors of the evaporation estimates into the modelling process can be case specific and depends on the model structure. This observation also draw attention on the adequacy of the model for a given experiment ( Addor and Melsen, 2019 ). Moreover, for a given evaporation dataset, the spatial variation in biases in the estimates can lead to contrasting performance across regions ( Jung et al., 2019 ;Nicholson, 2000 ).In general, it is observed that the model performances for S t and S u improve for most of the multivariate calibration scenarios. Among the multivariate calibration strategies, case SB gives the best results considering the average model performance for all variables ( Q, S t and S u ). In Fig. 7 b, the highest average relative change in model performance by multivariate calibration strategies as compared to the Q-only calibration is obtained with case SB is ( + 29%), followed by case SP ( + 26%), case PW ( + 24%) and case BA ( + 20%). Consequently, all grid-based model calibration strategies outperform the basin-average calibration (case BA), which gives the lowest average model performance. These results highlight the value of calibrating hydrological models on the full extent of gridded evaporation datasets. It is noted that, in most of the scenarios, calibrating the model only on the spatial patterns (case SP) of the evaporation datasets, thereby ignoring their absolute values, improves the predictive skill of the model with a higher performance than that of case Q and case BA ( Fig. 6 ). With these findings, case SP (i.e., only spatial patterns of evaporation datasets) can be preferred to case SB (i.e., absolute values of evaporation datasets) for the calibration of hydrological models because the propagation of the errors of the evaporation estimates into the modelling process can be case specific and depends on the model structure. This observation also draw attention on the adequacy of the model for a given experiment ( Addor and Melsen, 2019 ). Moreover, for a given evaporation dataset, the spatial variation in biases in the estimates can lead to contrasting performance across regions ( Jung et al., 2019 ;Nicholson, 2000 ).</p>
        <p>The spatial patterns of ALEXI, followed by those of MOD16A2 and CMRSET, were the least informative for the model calibration in case SP ( Fig. 6 ). Considering all hydrological processes and model calibration strategies, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, 
            <rs type="software">GLEAM</rs> v
            <rs type="version">3.3a</rs> and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5 ( Figs. 6 and7 a). However, it is noteworthy that they outperform the Q-only calibration when used in case SP, meaning that only their spatial patterns improve the model performance. In general, the versions 3

        <p>Different model calibration strategies result in different spatial patterns of modelled E a and S u , as shown for selected scenarios in Fig. 8 . Additional maps of E a , S u and S t for other scenarios are provided in the supplementary material (Figures S58-59, Figures S65-66 andFigures S38-39), along with those obtained with the Q-only calibration (Figure S12). In general, the south to north gradient of increasing aridity observed with modelled E a and S u is well depicted for all the calibration strategies. However, considerable mismatches in the variability of the patterns are observed among the calibration strategies. Such discrepancies in spatial patterns have implications for water resources assessment including water accounting, flood and drought monitoring and prediction ( AghaKouchak et al., 2015 ;Klemas, 2014 ;Teng et al., 2017 ;West et al., 2019 ). Knowing when flood or drought events occur is important, but knowing the spatial extent of the event is crucial for deploying efficient adaptation and mitigation strategies ( Brunner et al., 2020 ;Diaz et al., 2019 ;He et al., 2020 ). Consequently, improving the representation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes should be a key consideration in modelling with spatially distributed models. The comparison of the maps of modelled E a ( Fig. 8 a) with the reference ALEXI dataset ( Fig. 3 ) reveals that the spatial patterns of E a in the case BA show the highest mismatch with the reference, thereby unveiling the Fig. 9. Model performance of streamflow ( Q ), terrestrial water storage ( S t ) and soil moisture ( S u ) using various evaporation datasets and model calibration strategies with the mHM model. The results are shown for the four climatic zones in the Volta River Basin (VRB) over the simulation period (2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012). Each score for a given evaporation product represents the average over the scores obtained with 4 calibration strategies, while the score is the average over scenarios with 12 evaporation datasets for each calibration strategy. The skill scores of the temporal dynamics are obtained with the Kling-Gupta efficiency ( E KG ) for Q and the Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r ) for S t and S u . The spatial pattern efficiency ( E SP ) is used to assess the spatial representation of S u . The benchmark model performance is given for the Q-only calibration as a reference. The skill scores are ranked from the highest (bluest) to the lowest (reddest). potential pitfalls of the basin-average calibration. The highest improvement of the spatial patterns of S u is obtained with case SB ( + 101%), followed by case SP ( + 93%) and case PW ( + 85%), while case BA ( + 76%) provides the least improvement ( Fig. 7 b).Different model calibration strategies result in different spatial patterns of modelled E a and S u , as shown for selected scenarios in Fig. 8 .

        <p>The analysis of the model performance according to climatic zones is done for all hydrological processes except Q because of the few gauging stations, which are unevenly distributed across the VRB (cf. Fig. 1 ). The results reveal contrasting model performances across climatic zones ( Fig. 9 ).

        <p>In average, the model performance at predicting the temporal dynamics of S t and the spatial patterns of S u is higher in the intermediate climatic regions (i.e., Sudano-Sahelian and Sudanian zones) than in the driest and wettest regions (i.e., Sahelian and Guinean zones) of the VRB.

Similar to results obtained at the entire VRB scale ( Section 3.1 ), MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5 still show the lowest contribution in improving the model performance across different climatic zones. More details on the ranking of the evaporation datasets are provided in the supplementary material (Tables S1-S5; Figures S14, S21 andS40).

        <p>Contrary to the basin scale analysis, case SP is the least efficient calibration strategy per climatic zones. This result can be justified by the fact that the model calibration on the spatial patterns of evaporation datasets is done at the scale of the VRB. Consequently, the spatial variability of hydrological processes at large scale is not representative of the climatic zones where the patterns are more homogenous. For regions with strong spatial variability, sub-region model calibration on spatial patterns can be a way forward in overcoming the pitfalls of domain-wide calibration, thereby ultimately resulting in a higher model performance.Contrary to the basin scale analysis, case SP is the least efficient calibration strategy per climatic zones.

        <p>The results presented are primarily valid for the VRB because errors in evaporation estimates are known to vary according to region ( Hartanto et al., 2017 ;Sörensson and Ruscica, 2018 ). However, the innovative model evaluation approach proposed in this study is not location-specific and can be applied to other regions using a grid-based hydrological model. The robust evaluation approach for evaporation datasets is based on multiple hydrological processes, and responds to the recent call of the scientific community for process-oriented diagnostics of earth system models ( Maloney et al., 2019 ;Melsen et al., 2016 ). The same methodology can be deployed for the evaluation of other spatial observational datasets such as gridded soil moisture estimates using robust metrics ( Dong et al., 2019 ), and subsequently be used to estimate their value for hydrological modelling. Moreover, this study highlights the potential of satellite and reanalysis evaporation datasets to improve the representation of various hydrological processes, which might guide modellers in choosing the adequate product for their applications, and support the data developers in their quest of improving global estimates of evaporation ( McCabe et al., 2019 ). It must be noted that the overall ranking in Fig. 9 does not systematically determine whether a dataset is good or bad, rather it shows which evaporation product provides the highest or lowest model performance for a given hydrological flux or state variable. Only the skill scores allow a judgement on the ability of a given dataset to yield a good model performance.The results presented are primarily valid for the VRB because errors in evaporation estimates are known to vary according to region ( Hartanto et al., 2017 ;Sörensson and Ruscica, 2018 ).

        <p>There might be uncertainties related to the rescaling of the evaporation datasets from their native spatial resolutions to that of the hydrological modelling resolution. However, for a fair comparison, all the datasets should be used at the same spatiotemporal resolution. The high performance of the GLEAM datasets is most likely due to the integration of soil moisture information in the calculation of actual evaporation. Therefore, 
            <rs type="software">GLEAM</rs> is expected to perform well for hydrological modelling. Surprisingly, MERRA-2 ranks among the best evaporation datasets notwithstanding its coarse spatial resolution. The high performance of MERRA-2 can be explained by its high temporal resolution, which might compensate its lower spatial resolution. In general, there is no clear tendency of SRS datasets to outperform the reanalysis datasets, and vice versa. Thus, besides their use as forcing data, reanalysis datasets represent a valuable source of information for the calibration of hydrological models. Satellite data of soil moisture and terrestrial water storage used for model evaluation in this study are not free of errors. However, at large scale and in poorly gauged regions, they are the only source of data that can be used for spatial model evaluation ( Peters-Lidard et al., 2019 ).

        <p>Overall, this study strives to provide solutions to some of the current challenges in hydrology (i.e., modelling methods, uncertainty and spatial variability; Blöschl et al., 2019 ). The proposed methodology represents an innovative way to use satellite and reanalysis datasets to improve process representation in hydrological models ( Clark et al., 2015 ;Peters-Lidard et al., 2017 ), develop hydrological water accounting ( Hunink et al., 2019 ) and advance prediction in ungauged basins ( Hrachowitz et al., 2013 ;Zhang et al., 2019 ).Overall, this study strives to provide solutions to some of the current challenges in hydrology (i.e., modelling methods, uncertainty and spatial variability; Blöschl et al., 2019 ).

        <p>Future studies should test the advantages of a multi-scale calibration framework that accounts for both domain-wide and sub-domain spatial heterogeneity, which might lead to better prediction of spatial patterns across climatic zones at large scale. Calibration strategies with multiple non-commensurable variables as well as spatial patterns is a way forward in advancing process representation in hydrological models ( Dembélé et al., 2020a ;Nijzink et al., 2018 ;Zink et al., 2018 ). More importantly, the choice of the calibration strategy or the objective function is determinant for high model performance, mainly under a changing environment ( Fowler et al., 2018 ;Schaefli et al., 2010 ). Uncertainties in the structure of the mHM model might influence the modelled hydrological processes. For instance, the calculation of actual evaporation ( Section 2.1 ) might be subject to a double accounting of stress from both the leaf area index and soil moisture. However, in such case, the sources of stress can be proportionally adjusted by the model parameters during the calibration. Further work should investigate the impact of different model structures on the methodology proposed in this study, and assess the parameter sensitivity of mHM depending on calibration strategies and variables, which is beyond the scope of the current study. Besides improving model calibration, satellite and reanalysis datasets can play an important role in identifying deficiencies in model structures and contribute to model improvement ( Hulsman et al., 2020 ). As the accuracy of the satellite and reanalysis datasets depends on the quality of the input meteorological datasets used for their production, it is also important to assess the impact of precipitation datasets on evaporation modelling ( Dembélé et al., 2020b ;Mao and Wang, 2017 ;Or and Lehmann, 2019 ).Future studies should test the advantages of a multi-scale calibration framework that accounts for both domain-wide and sub-domain spatial heterogeneity, which might lead to better prediction of spatial patterns across climatic zones at large scale.

        <p>These findings contribute to solving current challenges related to large-scale hydrological modelling and provide avenues for improving process representation with the use of increasingly available satellite and reanalysis datasets. Improving the representation of the spatial patterns of hydrological processes should be a key consideration in modelling with spatially distributed models, which would allow better predicting floods and droughts. Moreover, the results provide insights to the developers of the evaporation datasets and might serve of guidance for future developments. However, a replication of the proposed methodology to evaluate evaporation datasets should be applied in other regions with different hydro-climatic conditions, and with different hydrological and land surface models.
