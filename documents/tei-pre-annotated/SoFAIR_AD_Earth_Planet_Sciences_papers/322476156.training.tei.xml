        <p>The surface tension of surfactant-containing, finite volume droplets Bryan R. Bzdek a,1 , Jonathan P. Reid a,1 , Jussi Malila b , and Nønne L. Prisle b  a School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, BS8 1TS Bristol, United Kingdom; and b Nano and Molecular Systems Research Unit, University of Oulu, 90014 Oulu, Finland Edited by Ravi R. Ravishankara, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, and approved February 28, 2020 (received for review September 9, 2019) Surface tension influences the fraction of atmospheric particles that become cloud droplets. Although surfactants are an important component of aerosol mass, the surface tension of activating aerosol particles is still unresolved, with most climate models assuming activating particles have a surface tension equal to that of water. By studying picoliter droplet coalescence, we demonstrate that surfactants can significantly reduce the surface tension of finite-sized droplets below the value for water, consistent with recent field measurements. Significantly, this surface tension reduction is droplet size-dependent and does not correspond exactly to the macroscopic solution value. A fully independent monolayer partitioning model confirms the observed finite-sizedependent surface tension arises from the high surface-to-volume ratio in finite-sized droplets and enables predictions of aerosol hygroscopic growth. This model, constrained by the laboratory measurements, is consistent with a reduction in critical supersaturation for activation, potentially substantially increasing cloud droplet number concentration and modifying radiative cooling relative to current estimates assuming a water surface tension. The results highlight the need for improved constraints on the identities, properties, and concentrations of atmospheric aerosol surfactants in multiple environments and are broadly applicable to any discipline where finite volume effects are operative, such as studies of the competition between reaction rates within the bulk and at the surface of confined volumes and explorations of the influence of surfactants on dried particle morphology from spray driers.The surface tension of surfactant-containing, finite volume droplets Bryan R.

        <p>Aerosol chemical composition measurements challenge the assumption that the surface tension of activating particles is equal to that of water. Organic aerosols contain surface active molecules in sufficient abundance to reduce the surface tension of macroscopic solutions (4,7,8), and these abundances could, in principle, be sufficient to maintain a reduced surface tension throughout activation (7)(8)(9)(10)(11). Such a reduction could increase CCN concentrations by an order of magnitude (12). Moreover, organic films may significantly alter the growth pathway of activating particles (13)(14)(15), and dynamic surface effects may be important (16,17).Aerosol chemical composition measurements challenge the assumption that the surface tension of activating particles is equal to that of water.

        <p>The major challenge to resolve the impact of surfactants on aerosol particle surface tension is to accurately account for a surface-to-volume ratio orders of magnitude larger for a finitesized droplet than for a macroscopic solution. A high surface-tovolume ratio increases the fraction of the total molecules partitioned to the surface, which lowers the bulk concentration and reduces the solute effect in the Köhler equation. Such partitioning may fully or partially counteract the surface tension lowering effect of surfactants and must be considered when predicting particle activation (18)(19)(20)(21)(22). Accounting for this partitioning is challenging because few approaches directly measure aerosol particle surface tension (23)(24)(25)(26)(27) and so far none have investigated surfactant partitioning in detail. Most approaches infer surface tension from hygroscopic growth or critical supersaturation measurements (28). Moreover, many studies report only macroscopic solution surface tension measurements and do not consider surfacebulk partitioning effects (4,7,8,16,29). Consequently, predictions of surfactant partitioning in aerosol are not accompanied by direct Significance Atmospheric aerosol particles cool Earth's climate by serving as cloud droplet seeds. This cooling effect represents both the single most uncertain and the largest negative radiative forcing. Cloud droplet activation is strongly influenced by aerosol particle surface tension, which in climate models is assumed equivalent to that of pure water. We directly measure the surface tensions of surfactant-coated, high surface-to-volume ratio droplets, demonstrating that their surface tensions are significantly lower than pure water but do not match the surface tension of the solution from which they were produced and depend on finite droplet size. These results suggest surfactants could potentially significantly modify radiative forcing and highlight the need for a better understanding of atmospheric surfactant concentrations and properties.The major challenge to resolve the impact of surfactants on aerosol particle surface tension is to accurately account for a surface-to-volume ratio orders of magnitude larger for a finitesized droplet than for a macroscopic solution.

Two aqueous droplets each with a 5-to 10-μm radius containing known concentrations of a primary solute and a soluble surfactant were optically trapped and then coalesced into one composite droplet (Fig. 1A). Droplet coalescence excites damped oscillations in droplet shape (Fig. 1B), which were monitored by recording the elastic backscattered laser light. The frequency of these oscillations is related to the droplet surface tension (41,42).

        <p>The observation of higher measured surface tensions in microscopic droplets relative to the macroscopic solution is a consequence of the large surface-to-volume ratio of picoliter droplets. In a macroscopic solution, the fraction of surfactant molecules that partitions to the solution surface is negligible compared to the total number of molecules in the bulk because the surface-tovolume ratio is small and the total number of molecules in the solution volume is very large (i.e., N surface &lt;&lt; N bulk in Eq. 1, so N tot ≈ N bulk , where N tot = N surface + N bulk ). However, in a finitesized droplet, the fraction of surfactant molecules that partitions to the surface represents a significant portion of the total number of molecules in the droplet because of the larger surface-tovolume ratio (N tot &gt;&gt; N bulk ) (19,22). For example, a pendant drop tensiometry experiment on a 1 mM solution of surfactant might involve analysis of a 1-mm-radius droplet, which corresponds to a surface-to-volume ratio of 3,000 m -1 . By comparison, a 10-μmradius droplet has a surface-to-volume ratio 100 times larger (3 × 10 5 m -1 ). Consequently, equilibrium partitioning of surfactant molecules to the surface of the 10-μm-radius droplet requires removal of a larger fraction of the total molecules from the bulk to form the surface film (i.e., a larger fraction at the surface), decreasing the fraction of molecules in the bulk and lowering [Triton X-100] bulk below 1 mM. The result, when plotted as [Triton X-100] tot , is a higher surface tension in the droplet relative to macroscopic solution measurements. If surface-bulk partitioning were considered and an appropriate correction included, then the droplet measurements would collapse onto the macroscopic solution measurements when plotted as [Triton X-100] bulk .The observation of higher measured surface tensions in microscopic droplets relative to the macroscopic solution is a consequence of the large surface-to-volume ratio of picoliter droplets.

        <p>The hypothesis that the droplet measurements are sensitive to the high surface-to-volume ratio and the resulting bulk depletion of the surfactant is tested using a monolayer partitioning model (43). This model was developed to quantify the surface-bulk partitioning for a droplet with a finite volume containing a specific number of surfactant molecules and is fully independent of the measurements (no fit parameters) (Methods). The surface is considered as a finite-sized phase with a thickness corresponding to one molecular layer, and surface tension is predicted from the bulk composition that results from the equilibrium distribution of molecules between the surface and bulk. Unlike other recently developed models, the only experimental data used to constrain the monolayer partitioning model are a modified Szyszkowski-Langmuir parameterization of the macroscopic solution surface tension data (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) and the solution density.The hypothesis that the droplet measurements are sensitive to the high surface-to-volume ratio and the resulting bulk depletion of the surfactant is tested using a monolayer partitioning model (43).

        <p>This monolayer partitioning model was selected over more commonly used Gibbs models (12,22) and a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals model (13) for several reasons. First, the monolayer partitioning model is fully predictive, has no free parameters, and is only constrained by measurements not related to the droplet experiments, in contrast to the 2D van der Waals model. Second, the Gibbs model tends to overestimate partitioning, as discussed in greater detail in previous modeling studies (17,43,44), and has compared poorly against experimental and field studies in some cases (12,20), providing unphysically large estimations of surface layer thicknesses (20). Here, we compare the experimental data for the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 droplets to a Gibbs model (22) and, similar to these previous studies (12,17,20,43,44), we observe that the extent of surface partitioning is overpredicted relative to the measurements (i.e., the Gibbs model overestimates N surface and underestimates N bulk ), thereby predicting much higher surface tensions than experimentally measured (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Although perhaps counterintuitive, this observation reflects the impact of surface partitioning on N bulk , which can usually be ignored in bulk phase measurements but strongly and implicitly depends on surface enrichment in finite-volume systems. The very act of enriching the surface depletes the bulk phase, which depresses the bulk surfactant concentration and leads to an erroneous inferred surface tension when the total composition alone is used as the reference concentration to predict surface tension.This monolayer partitioning model was selected over more commonly used Gibbs models (12,22) and a two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals model (13) for several reasons.

        <p>Modeled droplet surface tensions are shown in Fig. 2A for three droplet radii (7.0, 8.5, and 10.0 μm), spanning the experimentally measured droplet radius range. The modeled surface tensions, which account for surface-bulk partitioning, agree well with direct droplet measurements. At [Triton X-100] tot = 0 mM, the predicted droplet surface tension is equivalent to that of the macroscopic solution of glutaric acid. This observation indicates that depletion effects are not manifested in this size range for glutaric acid, which has weak intrinsic surface propensity but is a water-soluble organic compound, mainly due to the very high concentrations (hundreds of millimolar) studied. As [Triton X-100] tot increases, the predicted surface tension decreases. Near [Triton X-100] tot = 0.6 to 0.7 mM, the predicted surface tension sharply drops because the critical micelle concentration (CMC) is reached in the droplet bulk. This steep change in predicted surface tension is an artifact of plotting the model data against [Triton X-100] tot rather than [Triton X-100] bulk . Beyond the steep change in surface tension, the CMC is surpassed and the surface tension is invariant with surfactant concentration. The steep change in predicted surface tension results from the small size and small absolute number of molecules in a droplet, together with the manner of plotting the data. A small increase in the absolute number of surfactant molecules in the droplet bulk corresponds to a large increase in surfactant mole fraction, which can manifest as a steep change in surface tension for sufficiently small volumes. For example, the surface tension of an 11-nm-radius droplet is predicted to be initially unaffected by increases in [Triton X-100] tot because all molecules are partitioned to the droplet surface and none reside in the droplet bulk. However, a single surfactant molecule residing in the droplet bulk drives [Triton X-100] bulk above the CMC (43). Therefore, the predicted surface tension would implicitly follow a step function when plotted against [Triton X-100] tot , highlighting the importance of considering the total surfactant concentration rather than just the bulk concentration. However, as demonstrated in Fig. 2B and discussed below, when the experimental data are plotted against [Triton X-100] bulk , a continuous trend in surface tension is observed. For larger droplets, this behavior transitions toward a smoother variation in surface tension as the total surfactant concentration increases. The model prediction therefore qualitatively resembles the "compressed film-to-gaseous phase transition" of surfactant films described by a 2D van der Waals model (13,14,45). A key difference in our model is that the steep change in surface tension is due to size-dependent surfacebulk partitioning, whereas in the 2D van der Waals model it is due to a phase transition in the surface film (43).Modeled droplet surface tensions are shown in Fig. 2A for three droplet radii (7.0, 8.5, and 10.0 μm), spanning the experimentally measured droplet radius range.

        <p>To confirm the model accurately accounts for surface-bulk partitioning, surface tension predictions at 0.050-, 7.0-, 8.5-, and 10.0-μm radius were compared with macroscopic solution measurements (Fig. 2B).

A trend of increasing surface tension with decreasing composite droplet radius and increasing surfaceto-volume ratio is clear, confirming experimentally that the droplet surface tension is size-dependent at a constant [Triton X-100] tot . Although the same general trend is predicted by the model (higher surface tension at smaller radius), the magnitude of the change is smaller. Nonetheless, the hypothesis that surfacebulk partitioning is significant in picoliter droplets is confirmed.Droplet Size-Dependent Surface Tension.

        <p>Surface Tensions of Droplets Containing Salt and Surfactant. Droplets containing NaCl and Triton X-100 were also studied. Fig. 4 compares surface tension measurements of 7-to 9-μm-radius droplets to macroscopic solution values. These data are derived from 39 individual coalescence events. The comparison of droplet and macroscopic solution surface tension values is broadly consistent with observations for the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 system: Picoliter droplet surface tension values are substantially higher than the corresponding macroscopic solution values when plotted against [Triton X-100] tot . A much larger maximum difference between droplet and macroscopic solution surface tension is observed for the NaCl-Triton X-100 system (35 mN•m -1 ) than for the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 system (15 mN•m -1 ). This observation is consistent with the salting-out effect. Salt alters surfactant partitioning properties, resulting in a larger surface excess (higher surface propensity) at a given [Triton X-100] bulk for the NaCl-Triton X-100 system than the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 system (evidenced by the steeper slope of the surface tension vs. concentration curve for NaCl-Triton X-100 in SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Consequently, when droplet surface tension is plotted against [Triton X-100] tot , a larger [Triton X-100] tot is required to reduce surface tension because a greater fraction of the surfactant molecules are partitioned to the droplet surface rather than the bulk. In other words, the relative magnitudes of N surface and N bulk in Eq. 1 shift toward N surface for the droplets containing salt.Surface Tensions of Droplets Containing Salt and Surfactant.

        <p>Model predictions of surface tensions for droplets (7.0-, 8.5-, and 10.0-μm radii) are also shown in Fig. 4. The surface tension values for each of these sizes are very close because of the stronger dependency of surface tension on [Triton X-100] bulk compared to the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 system (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).

        <p>Partitioning models predict that accounting for the surface-bulk partitioning of surface-active molecules becomes increasingly important in smaller droplets, where surface-to-volume ratios are much larger than in micrometer-sized droplets (e.g., 6 × 10 7 in a 0.05-μm-radius droplet). Based on this first direct validation of the model for picoliter droplets, we explored the surface tension effects of surfactants in smaller droplets more likely to dominate as CCN. Fig. 5A shows that for a 0.05-μm-radius droplet (a typical size for CCN) containing 0.9 M glutaric acid, [Triton X-100] tot must be &gt;&gt;1 mM to substantially lower the surface tension, a consequence of a high surface-to-volume ratio.Partitioning models predict that accounting for the surface-bulk partitioning of surface-active molecules becomes increasingly important in smaller droplets, where surface-to-volume ratios are much larger than in micrometer-sized droplets (e.g., 6 × 10 7 in a 0.05-μm-radius droplet).

        <p>Fig. 5B explores the significance of accounting for surface-bulk partitioning during cloud droplet activation by showing the hygroscopic growth of a 0.05-μm-radius particle with different initial surfactant concentrations. The model prediction accounts for both the dilution resulting from hygroscopic growth and the decreasing surface-to-volume ratio as the droplet size increases. With increasing droplet size due to hygroscopic growth, surface tension increases due to the dilution by condensing water. Countering this surface tension increase is the reduction owing to decreasing surface-to-volume ratio at larger droplet sizes, although this is insufficient to offset the concentration change from hygroscopic growth. Once enough water has condensed on the droplet, the surface tension approaches that of pure water (72 mN•m -1 ). With increasing initial surfactant concentration, an increasing fraction of droplet growth occurs with a surface tension &lt;72 mN•m -1 . The effects on critical radius (R c ), critical supersaturation (SS c ), and surface tension at activation (γ c ), as predicted by the Köhler equation (2,44), are shown in Fig. 5C and Table 1. When [Triton X-100] tot,init = 1 mM, γ c is equivalent to that for the reference case where [Triton X-100] tot,init = 0 mM. Consequently, R c and SS c are not significantly affected by the presence of surfactant. Similarly, when [Triton X-100] tot,init = 10 mM, γ c = 64 mN•m -1 , resulting in ∼10% changes to R c and SS c . However, when [Triton X-100] tot,init = 100 mM, droplet surface tension is predicted to be low during all of the droplet growth (γ c = 55 mN•m -1 ), resulting in an R c of 0.12 μm and an SS c of 0.57%, representing a 50% change in R c and a 37% change in SS c relative to the scenario where [Triton X-100] tot,init = 0 mM. When [Triton X-100] tot,init = 1,000 mM, surface tension is a minimum throughout growth, remaining 34 mN•m -1 at activation, thereby modifying R c to 0. Triton X-100 is likely to be representative of many atmospheric surfactants, as its CMC and γ CMC are consistent with those reported in atmospheric aerosol (7,20). Consequently, the monolayer partitioning model predictions suggest that the total surfactant concentration in particles must be at least on the order of several tens to 100 mM for there to be a substantial effect on cloud droplet activation. Gérard et al. (7,29) recently reported total surfactant concentrations in collected ambient fine aerosol reaching several tens to hundreds millimolar across Europe. Moreover, surfactant concentrations are enhanced in smaller (&lt;200-nm diameter) atmospheric particles (46). Such atmospheric observations combined with our results suggest surfactants in some cases will substantially impact the activation of atmospheric particles into cloud droplets. However, it may be unlikely for droplet surface tension to equal γ CMC at R c , which emphasizes the importance of considering finite size-dependent surfactant partitioning to accurately estimate surface tension. These results indicate surfactant effects may be challenging to identify in ambient studies because surfactants may only significantly affect cloud droplet activation under specific scenarios (12). Consequently, these results underscore the need for further investigation of surfactant effects, exploring a broader range of model surfactants and cosolutes to develop a more refined understanding of surfactant effects on cloud droplet activation.Fig. 5B explores the significance of accounting for surface-bulk partitioning during cloud droplet activation by showing the hygroscopic growth of a 0.05-μm-radius particle with different initial surfactant concentrations.

        <p>In conclusion, we provide direct measurements of the surface tensions of surfactant-coated, finite-sized picoliter droplets, which demonstrate that surface partitioning effects can result in droplet surface tensions up to 35 mN•m -1 larger (i.e., closer to the value for water) than the corresponding macroscopic solution owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio. Therefore, surface-bulk partitioning must be considered when reconciling finite-sized droplet surface tensions with macroscopic solution values. It is insufficient to simply use the macroscopic solution surface tension. We also demonstrate experimentally that surfactant partitioning in finitesized droplets is substantially affected by the presence of a cosolute (glutaric acid, NaCl). Considering atmospheric aerosols are complex chemical mixtures containing inorganic salts and organic molecules, of which surfactants are an important component (7,46), the surfactant-solute interactions and resulting size-dependent surface-bulk partitioning effects must be further explored.In conclusion, we provide direct measurements of the surface tensions of surfactant-coated, finite-sized picoliter droplets, which demonstrate that surface partitioning effects can result in droplet surface tensions up to 35 mN•m -1 larger (i.e., closer to the value for water) than the corresponding macroscopic solution owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio.

The qualitative agreement between measurement and model strengthens our confidence in the application of surface tension models accounting for surface-bulk partitioning as well as highlights the necessity for further model development to predict more accurately the surface properties of complex aerosol particles. Improved predictive capabilities will enable better estimation of N d , ultimately reducing uncertainty in the indirect aerosol effect.

        <p>Holographic Optical Tweezers. The instrumental approach has been described in detail elsewhere and is only briefly summarized here (23,39,40). Aerosol droplets are produced from an aqueous solution containing known concentrations of solute and surfactant using a standard medical nebulizer (NE U22; Omron). Droplets of typically 5-to 10-μm radius are captured in individual optical traps. These two steerable optical traps were created by dynamically shaping the phase front of a continuous-wave 532-nm laser (Opus 3W; Laser Quantum) using a liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulator (SLM) (X10468; Hamamatsu). The beam was expanded to fill the SLM display, which was conjugated to the back focal plane of a high-numerical-aperture microscope objective (Olympus ACH, 100×/1.25 oil) by a pair of condensing 4f telescopes. The trap separation was user controlled using a precalculated sequence of kinoforms (phase-only computer-generated holograms). A sufficiently small trap separation resulted in coalescence of the two trapped droplets into one composite droplet. Bright-field images to monitor droplet capture and coalescence were recorded with a camera (Dalsa Genie HM 640, Table 1.

        <p>For the droplets analyzed in this study, the correction was generally very small (&lt;2 mN•m -1 ). Note that this correction does not account for potential contributions from surface viscosity (50,51), but we estimate such effects impact the retrieved surface tension by &lt;10%. Droplets containing one primary solute (either glutaric acid, 99%; Acros or NaCl, 99.9999%; Sigma) and one soluble surfactant (Triton X-100, electrophoresis grade; Fisher) were studied. Surfactant concentrations were sufficiently low that effects on the solution RI were minimal (&lt;0.0005, measured with a refractometer). Therefore, the primary solute concentration (glutaric acid or NaCl) was measured directly via retrieval of the droplet RI through previously reported parameterizations for the primary solutes (23). To calculate the total surfactant concentration within a droplet, it was assumed that the known primary solute:surfactant ratio in the macroscopic solution was conserved after nebulization. This assumption is justified for the following three reasons. First, collection of nebulized aerosol (∼15 mL nebulized from a 30-mL solution) containing glutaric acid and Triton X-100 had the same RI and surface tension as the initial solution and the residual solution in the nebulizer, which is only expected if the glutaric acid:Triton X-100 ratio is conserved upon nebulization (SI Appendix, Table S1). Second, if the ratio were not conserved, one might expect substantial variability in retrieved surface tensions among measurements produced from solutions with the same primary solute:surfactant ratio. In fact, the surface tension values of droplets produced by nebulization of the same solution were uniformly consistent (&lt;±3 mN•m -1 ) over several weeks even using different nebulizers, with clear and consistent differences in measured droplet surface tensions apparent only when the primary solute:surfactant ratio was changed. Third, in previous work with mixtures of glutaric acid and NaCl, the retrieved droplet RI and corresponding surface tension gave excellent agreement with model predictions and macroscopic solution measurements, indicating the relative ratio of glutaric acid and NaCl in solution was conserved upon nebulization (26,52).For the droplets analyzed in this study, the correction was generally very small (&lt;2 mN•m -1 ).

        <p>The slight discrepancy (&lt;7 mN•m -1 ) between macroscopic solution and droplet surface tension measurements beyond the CMC may be due to the presence of the surfactant film on the surface of the droplet, which, as described above, can decrease the droplet oscillation frequency from its true value, resulting in a retrieved surface tension below the true value (50). Another possible explanation is that the composite droplet surface is slightly enriched in surfactant compared to a fully equilibrated surface. Coalescence produces a composite droplet with a smaller total surface area than the two initial droplets. If surfactant diffusion away from the composite droplet surface is slower than the timescale of the shape oscillation (10 to 100 μs), the composite droplet surface will not reestablish equilibrium, resulting in a tighter packing of surfactant molecules and a reduction in surface tension. In either case, the discrepancy would be most significant at values around the CMC. The magnitude of this discrepancy is always significantly less than the magnitude of the surface-bulk partitioning effects and would trend opposite to the surface-bulk partitioning effects.The slight discrepancy (&lt;7 mN•m -1 ) between macroscopic solution and droplet surface tension measurements beyond the CMC may be due to the presence of the surfactant film on the surface of the droplet, which, as described above, can decrease the droplet oscillation frequency from its true value, resulting in a retrieved surface tension below the true value (50).

        <p>Macroscopic Solution Surface Tensiometry Measurements. Surface tensions of all macroscopic solutions (which also served as the sources of the nebulized droplets) were measured using a Wilhelmy plate tensiometer (K100; Krüss). Macroscopic Solution Surface Tension Parameterisations. Although Gibbs adsorption isotherm fits (provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S3 for comparison) quantitatively reproduce surface tension measurements for ternary systems, they are not adequate for implementation into the monolayer partitioning model, as the Gibbs adsorption isotherm cannot be extended to arbitrary bulk compositions needed for partitioning calculations. Therefore, a modified Szyszkowski-Langmuir parameterization was fitted to the macroscopic solution surface tension data for both the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 and the NaCl-Triton X-100 systems at 298 K (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).

Surface tensions of all macroscopic solutions (which also served as the sources of the nebulized droplets) were measured using a Wilhelmy plate tensiometer (K100; Krüss). Macroscopic Solution Surface Tension Parameterisations. Although Gibbs adsorption isotherm fits (provided in SI Appendix, Fig. S3 for comparison) quantitatively reproduce surface tension measurements for ternary systems, they are not adequate for implementation into the monolayer partitioning model, as the Gibbs adsorption isotherm cannot be extended to arbitrary bulk compositions needed for partitioning calculations. Therefore, a modified Szyszkowski-Langmuir parameterization was fitted to the macroscopic solution surface tension data for both the glutaric acid-Triton X-100 and the NaCl-Triton X-100 systems at 298 K (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).

        <p>The higher SER for NaCl-Triton X-100 arises due to poorer fits at high solute concentrations ([NaCl] &gt; 2 M and [Triton X-100] &gt; 3 mM), which are not important for the concentrations in the droplets studied here. Cross terms a 3 [surfactant][solvent] represent contributions from composition dependent molecular area per surfactant molecule due to surfactant-solvent interactions. In both cases, the underlying parameters (a 1 and b 2 ) for both fits to the macroscopic solution data (provided in SI Appendix, Table S2) agree with those given by Zdziennicka et al.

At the limit of a water-glutaric acid solution (i.e., surfactant concentration = 0 mM), a 1 and b 2 agree with literature values (56). At the limit of a water-NaCl solution, the fit function predicts a linear dependence of surface tension on salt concentration with the resulting coefficient a 2 b 1 slightly below literature values (57).

        <p>The surface tension of pure, nonaqueous Triton X-100 is not known and therefore is approximated by γ CMC . Combined with Eq. 7, this leads to the condition that, at the CMC, x surface ≈ 1 for Triton X-100. In other words, the model assumes formation of a complete monolayer at the CMC. It is possible that the surface is not completely saturated when the CMC is approached in the bulk, in which case this assumption leads to a sudden jump in the modeled surface mole fraction x surface of Triton X-100 (and also in surface thickness δ). Furthermore, because the volume and density of the surface and bulk phases depend nonlinearly on [Triton X-100] tot , the assumption of a pure monolayer can in some cases lead to numerical fluctuations in the model close to the CMC. However, the effect on model predictions is minor.The surface tension of pure, nonaqueous Triton X-100 is not known and therefore is approximated by γ CMC .
