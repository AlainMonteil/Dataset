        <p>A new method, combining empirical modelling with time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data, is proposed to provide an assessment of potential landslide volume and area. The method was developed to evaluate potential landslides in the Heitai river terrace of the Yellow River in central Gansu Province, China. The elevated terrace has a substantial loess cover and along the terrace edges many landslides have been triggered by gradually rising groundwater levels following continuous irrigation since 1968. These landslides can have significant impact on communities, affecting lives and livelihoods. Developing effective landslide risk management requires better understanding of potential landslide magnitude. Fifty mapped landslides were used to construct an empirical power-law relationship linking landslide area (AL) to volume (VL) (V ! = 0.333 × A ! ".$%% ). InSAR-derived ground displacement ranges from -64 mm/y to 24 mm/y along line of sight (LOS). Further interpretation of patterns based on remote sensing (InSAR &amp; optical image ) and field survey enabled the identification of an additional 54 potential landslides (1.9×10 2 m 2 ≤AL≤ 8.1×10 4 m 2 ). In turn this enabled construction of a map that shows the magnitude of potential landslide activity. This research provides significant further scientific insights to inform landslide hazard and risk management, in a context of ongoing landscape evolution. It also provides further evidence that this methodology can be used to quantify the magnitude of potential landslides and thus contribute essential information towards landslide risk management.A new method, combining empirical modelling with time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data, is proposed to provide an assessment of potential landslide volume and area.

        <p>Landslides involve the downward and outward mass movement of slope materials composed of rock, soils, artificial fills, or a combination of these materials (Cruden &amp; Varnes, 1996). Ongoing population growth, rapidly expanding societies, coupled with gradually progressing environmental (climate) change enhances pressures on the natural environment and results in increased exposure to potentially unstable terrain. Landslides are geohazards that globally result in serious impacts, annually causing tens of billions of US$ worth of damage and more than 4,300 lives lost (Froude and Petley, 2018;Intrieri et al., 2019).Landslides involve the downward and outward mass movement of slope materials composed of rock, soils, artificial fills, or a combination of these materials (Cruden &amp; Varnes, 1996).

        <p>Recent developments in remote sensing techniques can significantly contribute to developing more effective landslide hazard and risk management. This includes more efficient mapping of landslides using high resolution satellite imagery in a three-dimensional virtual environment and manipulating this digital information to allow further quantitative analyses of landslide parameters (location, size, volume, state of activity; Guzzetti et al., 2005;Crosta et al., 2013;Broeckx et al., 2018). In addition, ground deformation on a millimeter scale obtained using time-series InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) can be used to update landslide inventory maps and to identify pre-cursor signatures in the landscape that can be used to identify potential landslides ( Remote sensing techniques have thus been used successfully to investigate the position and movements of landslides and unstable slopes. However, for disaster risk management it is of greater importance to obtain a measure of the magnitude of potential landslides, e.g. through estimating the volume of material involved (Corominas et al., 2014). This research highlights a feasible route to achieve this, using a case study of the Heitai river terrace in central Gansu Province, China.Recent developments in remote sensing techniques can significantly contribute to developing more effective landslide hazard and risk management.

        <p>Identifying and quantifying the volume of a landslide is possible by measuring the shape and inferring the slip surface geometry of landslides from a range of observational data or using an empirical relationship between geometrical properties (Guzzetti et al., 2009;Malamud et al., 2010;Cui et al., 2018). However, this is generally a laborious and data-intensive assessment that is only realistic for individual events. When a large number of landslides are encountered this soon becomes an unfeasible / uneconomical task and forecasting the volume of potential landslides is even more challenging as there is added uncertainty regarding the landslide geometry and morphology of potential slip surfaces.Identifying and quantifying the volume of a landslide is possible by measuring the shape and inferring the slip surface geometry of landslides from a range of observational data or using an empirical relationship between geometrical properties (Guzzetti et al., 2009;Malamud et al., 2010;Cui et al., 2018).

        <p>In this paper, a combined approach is illustrated that uses an empirical model, InSAR techniques and field surveying to evaluate the magnitude of potential landslides (Fig. 1). Firstly, a landslide inventory is established which records the area (AL) and volume (VL) of historic landslides (among other parameters). Subsequently, an empirical relationship between AL and VL is established (cf. Guzzetti et al., 2009). Time-series InSAR data, coupled with geomorphological observations are used to derive polygons showing the location and extent of potential landslides. The empirical relationship is used to convert these areas into volume estimations of these potential landslides. In turn, these estimations enable characterization of the magnitude of the potential events.In this paper, a combined approach is illustrated that uses an empirical model, InSAR techniques and field surveying to evaluate the magnitude of potential landslides (Fig. 1).

        <p>From 1968, irrigation systems were established to support agricultural activities developed on Heitai terrace. Approximately 5 times per year the terrace is irrigated resulting in a process of ground water recharge that has raised the groundwater level by 20 m at an average annual rate of 0.18 m (Xu et al., 2014). Raising groundwater levels induced more than 107 loess-related landslides since 1969, destroying buildings, facilities and causing multiple fatalities (Dijkstra et al., 1994;Zeng et al., 2016). Presently, some 50 landslide signatures are still visible as older events are superseded by later ones (Fig. 2). In addition, information from all available maps and tables in the literature above were digitized and incorporated into the Heitai landslide inventory. Further 3D interpretation of satellite images from

        <p>The movement of a landslide can be divided into four stages: 1) the pre-failure stage, 2) the onset of failure, 3) the post-failure stage and 4) the reactivation stage (Leroueil, 2001). For brittle materials that have very little or no discernable pre-failure strain it is difficult to detect the pre-cursors to failure. However, the pre-failure strains of loess deposits in Heitai terrace are well documented and observations from both laboratory tests and field investigations have shown that loess deposits can accumulate substantial pre-failure strains as a consequence of gradually accumulating micro-shears in the loess fabric (Zhang and Wang, 2017; Shi et al., 2019).The movement of a landslide can be divided into four stages: 1) the pre-failure stage, 2) the onset of failure, 3) the post-failure stage and 4) the reactivation stage (Leroueil, 2001).

        <p>Following on from the early works on pre-failure strain by Saito (1965) and Voight (1988), it has been proposed that extrapolation of the reciprocal of displacement rate (velocity) can indicate when a material would fail. However, the mobilization of pre-failure strains responds to varying stress and moisture conditions in these materials providing a potentially complex pattern of strain before accelerating until failure. Pre-failure strain can be summarized into three sub-phases (Saito, 1969;Voight, 1989;Petley et al., 2005;Federico et al., 2012) (Fig. 12):Following on from the early works on pre-failure strain by Saito (1965) and Voight (1988), it has been proposed that extrapolation of the reciprocal of displacement rate (velocity) can indicate when a material would fail.

        <p>The time series InSAR technique to monitor non-linear ground displacement at millimeter scale over time provides extremely valuable information to characterize not just the susceptibility of the terrain to generate a landslide, but also the type of pre-failure strain that the slope is subject to; decelerating (Fig. 13a); steady (Fig. 13b); or accelerating strains potentially leading to failure (Fig. 13c). The displacement trends of each polygon were checked using the

            <rs type="software">QGIS</rs> software and, using geomorphological features, were classified manually to ensure accuracy. The pre-failure strain behavior was classified by the displacement trends of pixels in the section with largest displacement rates. Figure 14 shows potential landslides along the edges of the Heitai terrace classified according to these precursory characteristics. The majority of the potential landslides (i.e. 37, 1.6×10 7 m 3 , 83% of total volume) show steady strains behavior with a constant rate of displacement over the observed period. The displacement rates of 14 potential landslides (2.9×10 6 m 3 , 14% of total volume) show signs of accelerating strains. The remaining three potential landslides (0.7×10 6 m 3 , 3% of total volume) appear to be decelerating.

        <p>The proposed method provides reliable predictive capability with respect to area and volume of potential landslides at the Heitai river terrace, which are crucial parameters to assess and manage the associated risk. Studies about the empirical relationship between AL and VL are mostly established based on the volume and affected area of landslides (Malamud et al., 2004;Guzzetti et al., 2009;Qiu et al., 2017). Uncertainty in the established relationships can be introduced by local conditions, such as geometry and relief of slip surfaces which represents also a limitation to the visibility of spaceborne SAR sensors (Notti et al., 2014) or where InSAR measurements are missing or incomplete because of land cover or displacements larger than the maximum detectable displacement (~28 mm between two consecutive acquisitions for Sentinel-1; Massonnet and Feigl, 1998).The proposed method provides reliable predictive capability with respect to area and volume of potential landslides at the Heitai river terrace, which are crucial parameters to assess and manage the associated risk.

        <p>The relationship derived from this study exhibits a trend that is similar to those reported by Guzzetti et al. (2009), but it appears to represent landslides that have slightly larger volumes relative to the ground surface area. This is potentially caused by the dominance of potential landslides occurring along a high terrace edge and a substantial loess thickness (&gt;50 m) influencing the depth of critical slip surfaces and resulting in a landslide population that would be marginally larger than those in more varied terrain. number of events upon which each relationship is based. These relationships are illustrated in Fig. 15. A sufficient density of CTs, which depends on the number and quality of images, temporal distribution and extent of data, characteristic of physical processes, CT detecting method and processing technique (Wasowski and Bovenga, 2014), can be used as support to distinguish the boundary of potential landslides. In addition, understanding the topography and mechanisms of geomorphological processes in the study area is vital, e.g. to improve identification and characterization of active slopes. The validation of the forecasted magnitude of potential landslides was further enhanced following three case studies of events that occurred soon after InSAR monitoring from 14 th October 2014 to 7 th May 2017. The geometrical and geomorphological characteristics of these three landslides were established using a Laser Rangefinder in the field (Fig. 16). The landslides shown in Fig. 16 are a re-activation of an existing landslide (16b), a re-activation of the crown area of an existing landslide (16d), and a new landslide (16e) respectively. The volume of the landslides was calculated as the product of the length, width and mean depth multiplied by a correction factor that depends on the geometry of the event. For a landslide occurring on a natural slope without previous slope failures, the coefficient is 0.5 (Figs. 16b and16e). The correction factor is taken as 0.3 where a landslide occurs on the backscarp and overlaps with previous landslide deposits (Fig. 16d). The shows a good consistence between the forecasted and actual landslide volume with a small overestimation of volume for the landslide shown in Fig. 16b. Figure 16d indicates that our empirical method only slightly underestimated the actual landslide volume. The actual landslide in Fig. 16e is located within the forecasted area, but did not manifest an event (as yet) that is as large as the forecasted size. It can be concluded therefore, that the applied method of forecasting the location and magnitude of potential landslides can provide an adequate insight into where the greatest risk is located providing a useful guide to assist with the management of these geohazards.The relationship derived from this study exhibits a trend that is similar to those reported by Guzzetti et al.

The landslides shown in Fig. 16 are a re-activation of an existing landslide (16b), a re-activation of the crown area of an existing landslide (16d), and a new landslide (16e) respectively. The volume of the landslides was calculated as the product of the length, width and mean depth multiplied by a correction factor that depends on the geometry of the event. For a landslide occurring on a natural slope without previous slope failures, the coefficient is 0.5 (Figs. 16b and16e). The correction factor is taken as 0.3 where a landslide occurs on the backscarp and overlaps with previous landslide deposits (Fig. 16d). The shows a good consistence between the forecasted and actual landslide volume with a small overestimation of volume for the landslide shown in Fig. 16b. Figure 16d indicates that our empirical method only slightly underestimated the actual landslide volume. The actual landslide in Fig. 16e is located within the forecasted area, but did not manifest an event (as yet) that is as large as the forecasted size. It can be concluded therefore, that the applied method of forecasting the location and magnitude of potential landslides can provide an adequate insight into where the greatest risk is located providing a useful guide to assist with the management of these geohazards.</p>
        <p>The three landslides shown in Fig. 16 have a similar geometry of the sliding surface; the landslides develop largely within the loess deposits and contain only small amounts of bedrock.The three landslides shown in Fig. 16 have a similar geometry of the sliding surface; the landslides develop largely within the loess deposits and contain only small amounts of bedrock.</p>
        <p>This corresponds well with the assumption used for the identification of potential landslides in this study. In the field survey that was carried out before these landslides occurred, large cracks were observed along the upper margin of the potential landslide of Fig. 16e. However, there were no apparent cracks observed that would indicate the position of the backscarps of the landslides in Fig. 16b and16d. This supports the value of using CTs for the identification of potential landslides, and that further evidence from geomorphological features (trends of cracks, sinkholes, valleys and ridges) can then provide added value for determining the extent of these potential events. The combination of InSAR and an empirical model not only extends their application, but also provides an important contribution towards the quantification of landslide risk assessment. The landslide volume that is determined using this approach enables estimation of the magnitude of potential landslides. Coupled with observations on the typical sliding velocity and runout distance of landslides in this region, in the near-future this could provide estimates of exposure to these hazards and improvements in risk reduction strategies for this region. Opportunities to estimate the probability of landslide occurrence will enhance as the InSAR time-series analysis accumulates.This corresponds well with the assumption used for the identification of potential landslides in this study.

        <p>This study has shown that this is a plausible pathway to determine the magnitude of potential landslides in this region. It also highlights that further work is required to establish (semi-)empirical or physical models to evaluate the full potential of using time-series displacement generated by InSAR to predict the occurrence (time, place, size) of landslides (Saito, 1969;Petley et al., 2005;Serena et al., 2017). Further analysis of these time-series displacement profiles of individual (potential) events can help to direct monitoring and observation resources to sites that are in an accelerating strain phase and help to highlight areas at risk that may require preventative evacuation.This study has shown that this is a plausible pathway to determine the magnitude of potential landslides in this region.

        <p>With time, this can result in a regional approach that addresses landslides hazard management throughout this part of the Loess Plateau and other similar regions.With time, this can result in a regional approach that addresses landslides hazard management throughout this part of the Loess Plateau and other similar regions.</p>

        <p>An inventory of 50 historical landslides was used to generate the empirical relationship (V # = 0.333 × A # $.&amp;'' ), which is in good agreement with similar relationships established elsewhere (Guzzetti et al. 2009). The total area and volume of historical landslides are 1.26×10 6 m 2 and 3.86×10 7 m 3 , respectively. The magnitude of these historical landslides is expressed as the base 10 logarithm of the landslide volume and varies from 3 to 6.An inventory of 50 historical landslides was used to generate the empirical relationship (V # = 0.333 × A # $.&amp;'' ), which is in good agreement with similar relationships established elsewhere (Guzzetti et al. 2009).

        <p>42 Sentinel 1 images acquired from 14 th October 2014 to 7 th May 2017 were processed by SBAS technique to generate the ground displacement rates to support the identification and mapping of potential landslides. A total of 157,434 CTs (2399 CTs km -2 ) with displacement rates between 24 mm/y and -64 mm/y were detected around the Heitai terrace. Fifty-four potential landslides were identified using the stability threshold of ±10 mm/y and further refined using geomorphological interpretation.42 Sentinel 1 images acquired from 14 th October 2014 to 7 th May 2017 were processed by SBAS technique to generate the ground displacement rates to support the identification and mapping of potential landslides.

        <p>Finally, the areas of these 54 potential landslides were mapped by time series InSAR and their volumes (VP) were calculated using the empirical relationship. The approach of this study enabled identification of location, area and volume of potential landslides in the Heitai terrace. The magnitude of these potential landslides (an expression based on the base 10 logarithm of landslide volume) helps to convey the severity of these events, were they to occur. Once the InSAR-based displacement time-series becomes longer, it is anticipated that analyses of the patterns of pre-failure strains will provide further insights into forecasting time to failure. The further development of effective landslide risk management in this region will benefit from this approach as it will provide the best available knowledge to characterize the location and size of a potential event. With careful analysis of the pattern of pre-failure strains this combined knowledge will be instrumental in designing appropriate management and mitigation strategies. The information also enables assessment of the potential for post-failure mobility and the modeling of landslide runout. In turn this enables designation of zones at risk from these potential landslides in the Heitai region and this will be reported in a separate paper.Finally, the areas of these 54 potential landslides were mapped by time series InSAR and their volumes (VP) were calculated using the empirical relationship.

        <p>Extending this method over a larger area in this part of the Loess Plateau will enhance the quality of the landslide inventory and fine-tune the empirical relationship. The landslides in the Heitai area generally occur entirely within the loess deposits, with the deepest slip surfaces positioned along the loess-bedrock interface. This rule of thumb works well in this region and it is reasonable to assume that this can also be applied in many other parts of the 440,000 km 2 large Loess Plateau or areas elsewhere where such clear distinctions in surface strata and underlying bedrock exist. This method has the potential to generate very useful information across a much larger regions that will benefit landslide risk assessment, hazard management, and research on landscape evolution.Extending this method over a larger area in this part of the Loess Plateau will enhance the quality of the landslide inventory and fine-tune the empirical relationship.
