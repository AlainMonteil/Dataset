        <p>The identity of the earliest inhabitants of Xinjiang, in the heart of Inner Asia, and the languages that they spoke have long been debated and remain contentious 1 . Here we present genomic data from 5 individuals dating to around 3000-2800 bc from the Dzungarian Basin and 13 individuals dating to around 2100-1700 bc from the Tarim Basin, representing the earliest yet discovered human remains from North and South Xinjiang, respectively. We find that the Early Bronze Age Dzungarian individuals exhibit a predominantly Afanasievo ancestry with an additional local contribution, and the Early-Middle Bronze Age Tarim individuals contain only a local ancestry. The Tarim individuals from the site of Xiaohe further exhibit strong evidence of milk proteins in their dental calculus, indicating a reliance on dairy pastoralism at the site since its founding. Our results do not support previous hypotheses for the origin of the Tarim mummies, who were argued to be Proto-Tocharian-speaking pastoralists descended from the Afanasievo 1,2 or to have originated among the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex 3 or Inner Asian Mountain Corridor cultures 4 . Instead, although Tocharian may have been plausibly introduced to the Dzungarian Basin by Afanasievo migrants during the Early Bronze Age, we find that the earliest Tarim Basin cultures appear to have arisen from a genetically isolated local population that adopted neighbouring pastoralist and agriculturalist practices, which allowed them to settle and thrive along the shifting riverine oases of the Taklamakan Desert.The identity of the earliest inhabitants of Xinjiang, in the heart of Inner Asia, and the languages that they spoke have long been debated and remain contentious 1 .

        <p>As part of the Silk Road and located at the geographic confluence of Eastern and Western cultures, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (henceforth Xinjiang) has long served as a major crossroads for trans-Eurasian exchanges of people, cultures, agriculture and languages 1,5-9 . Bisected by the Tianshan mountains, Xinjiang can be divided into two subregions referred to as North Xinjiang, which contains the Dzungarian Basin, and South Xinjiang, which contains the Tarim Basin (Fig. 1). The Dzungarian Basin in the north consists of the Gurbantünggüt Desert, which is surrounded by a vast expanse of grasslands traditionally inhabited by mobile pastoralists. The southern part of Xinjiang consists of the Tarim Basin, a dry inland sea that now forms the Taklamakan Desert. Although mostly uninhabitable, the Tarim Basin also contains small oases and riverine corridors, fed by runoff from thawing glacier ice and snow from the surrounding high mountains 4,10,11 .As part of the Silk Road and located at the geographic confluence of Eastern and Western cultures, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (henceforth Xinjiang) has long served as a major crossroads for trans-Eurasian exchanges of people, cultures, agriculture and languages 1,5-9 .

        <p>Within and around the Dzungarian Basin, pastoralist Early Bronze Age (EBA) Afanasievo (3000-2600 bc) and Chemurchek (or Qiemu'erqieke) (2500-1700 bc) 12 sites have been plausibly linked to the Afanasievo herders of the Altai-Sayan region in southern Siberia (3150-2750 bc), who in turn have close genetic ties with the Yamnaya (3500-2500 bc) of the Pontic-Caspian steppe located 3,000 km to the west [13][14][15] . Linguists have hypothesized that the Afanasievo dispersal brought the now extinct Tocharian branch of the Indo-European language family eastwards, separating it from other Indo-European languages by the third or fourth millennium bc (ref. 14 ). However, although Afanasievo-related ancestry has been confirmed among Iron Age Dzungarian populations (around 200-400 bc) 7 , and Tocharian is recorded in Buddhist texts from the Tarim Basin dating to ad 500-1000 (ref. 13 ), little is known about earlier Xinjiang populations and their possible genetic relationships with the Afanasievo or other groups.Within and around the Dzungarian Basin, pastoralist Early Bronze Age (EBA) Afanasievo (3000-2600 bc) and Chemurchek (or Qiemu'erqieke) (2500-1700 bc) 12 sites have been plausibly linked to the Afanasievo herders of the Altai-Sayan region in southern Siberia (3150-2750 bc), who in turn have close genetic ties with the Yamnaya (3500-2500 bc) of the Pontic-Caspian steppe located 3,000 km to the west [13][14][15] .

        <p>Since the late 1990s, the discovery of hundreds of naturally mummified human remains dating to around 2000 bc to ad 200 in the Tarim Basin has attracted international attention due to their so-called Western physical appearance, their felted and woven woollen clothing, and their agropastoral economy that included cattle, sheep/goats, wheat, barley, millet and even kefir cheese [16][17][18][19] . Such mummies have now been found throughout the Tarim Basin, among which the earliest are those found in the lowest layers of the cemeteries at Gumugou (2135-1939 bc), Xiaohe (1884-1736 bc) and Beifang (1785-1664 bc) (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). These and related Bronze Age sites are grouped within the Xiaohe archaeological horizon on the basis of their shared material culture 13,16,20 .Since the late 1990s, the discovery of hundreds of naturally mummified human remains dating to around 2000 bc to ad 200 in the Tarim Basin has attracted international attention due to their so-called Western physical appearance, their felted and woven woollen clothing, and their agropastoral economy that included cattle, sheep/goats, wheat, barley, millet and even kefir cheese [16][17][18][19] .

        <p>Multiple contrasting hypotheses have been suggested by scholars to explain the origins and Western elements of the Xiaohe horizon, including the Yamnaya/Afanasievo steppe hypothesis 16 , the Bactrian oasis hypothesis 21 and the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (IAMC) island biogeography hypothesis 4 . The Yamnaya/Afanasievo steppe hypothesis posits that the Afanasievo-related EBA populations in the Altai-Sayan mountains spread via the Dzungarian Basin into the Tarim Basin and subsequently founded the agropastoralist communities making up the Xiaohe horizon around 2000 bc (refs. 16,22,23 ). By contrast, the Bactrian oasis hypothesis posits that the Tarim Basin was initially colonized by migrating farmers of the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) (around 2300-1800 bc) from the desert oases of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan via the mountains of Central Asia. Support for this hypothesis is largely based on similarities in the agricultural and irrigation systems between the two regions that reflect adaptations to a desert environment, as well as evidence for the ritual use of Ephedra at both locations 3,21 . The IAMC island biogeography hypothesis similarly posits a mountain Central Asian origin for the Xiaohe founder population, but one linked to the transhumance of agropastoralists in the IAMC to the west and north of the Tarim Basin 4,24,25 . In contrast to these three migration models, the greater IAMC, which spans the Hindu Kush to Altai mountains, may have alternatively functioned as a geographic arena through which cultural ideas, rather than populations, primarily moved 25 .Multiple contrasting hypotheses have been suggested by scholars to explain the origins and Western elements of the Xiaohe horizon, including the Yamnaya/Afanasievo steppe hypothesis 16 , the Bactrian oasis hypothesis 21 and the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor (IAMC) island biogeography hypothesis 4 .

        <p>Recent archaeogenomic research has shown that Bronze Age Afanasievo of southern Siberia and IAMC/BMAC populations of Central Asia have distinguishable genetic profiles 15,26 , and that these profiles are likewise also distinct from those of pre-agropastoralist hunter-gatherer populations in Inner Asia 2,5,7,[27][28][29][30] . As such, an archaeogenomic investigation of Bronze Age Xinjiang populations presents a powerful approach for reconstructing the population histories of the Dzungarian and Tarim basins and the origins of the Bronze Age Xiaohe horizon. Examining the skeletal material of 33 Bronze Age individuals from sites in the Dzungarian (Nileke, Ayituohan and Songshugou) and Tarim (Xiaohe, Gumugou and Beifang) basins, we successfully retrieved ancient genome sequences from 5 EBA Dzungarian individuals (3000-2800 bc) culturally assigned as Afanasievo, and genome-wide data from 13 Early-Middle Bronze Age (EMBA) Tarim individuals (2100-1700 bc) belonging to the Xiaohe horizon (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1A). We additionally report dental calculus proteomes of seven individuals from basal layers at the site of Xiaohe in the Tarim Basin (Extended Data Table 2). To the best of our knowledge, these individuals represent the earliest human remains excavated to date in the region.Recent archaeogenomic research has shown that Bronze Age Afanasievo of southern Siberia and IAMC/BMAC populations of Central Asia have distinguishable genetic profiles 15,26 , and that these profiles are likewise also distinct from those of pre-agropastoralist hunter-gatherer populations in Inner Asia 2,5,7,[27][28][29][30] .

        <p>Outgroup f 3 statistics supports a tight genetic link between the Dzungarian and Tarim groups (Extended Data Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, both of the Dzungarian groups are significantly different from the Tarim groups, showing excess affinity with various western Eurasian populations and sharing fewer alleles with ANE-related groups (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). To understand this mixed genetic profile, we used qpAdm to explore admixture models of the Dzungarian groups with Tarim_ EMBA1 or a terminal Pleistocene individual (AG3) from the Siberian site of Afontova Gora 31 , as a source (Supplementary Data 1D). AG3 is a distal representative of the ANE ancestry and shows a high affinity with Tarim_EMBA1. Although the Tarim_EMBA1 individuals lived a millennium later than the Dzungarian groups, they are more genetically distant from the Afanasievo than the Dzungarian groups, suggesting that they have a higher proportion of local autochthonous ancestry.Outgroup f 3 statistics supports a tight genetic link between the Dzungarian and Tarim groups (Extended Data Fig. 2A).

        <p>Here we define autochthonous to signify a genetic profile that has been present in a region for millennia, rather than being associated with more recently arrived groups. We find that Dzungaria_EBA1 and Dzungaria_EBA2 are both best described by three-way admixture models (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Table 3 and Supplementary Data 1D) in which they derive a majority ancestry from Afanasievo (about 70% in Dzungaria_EBA1 and about 50% in Dzungaria_EBA2), with the remaining ancestry best modelled as a mixture of AG3/Tarim_EMBA1 (19-36%) and Baikal_EBA (9-21%). When we use Eneolithic and Bronze Age populations from the IAMC as a source, models fail when Afanasievo is not included as a source, and no contribution is allocated to the IAMC groups when Afanasievo is included (Supplementary Data 1D). Thus, Afanasievo ancestry, without IAMC contributions, is sufficient to explain the western Eurasian component of the Dzungarian individuals. We also find that the Chemurchek, an EBA pastoralist culture that succeeds the Afanasievo in both the Dzungarian Basin and Altai Mountains, derive approximately two-thirds of their ancestry from Dzungaria_EBA1 with the remainder from Tarim_EMBA1 and IAMC/BMAC-related sources (Fig. 3, Extended Data Table 3, Supplementary Data 1F and Supplementary Text 5). This helps to explain both the IAMC/BMAC-related ancestry previously noted in Chemurchek individuals 30 and their reported cultural and genetic affiliations to Afanasievo groups 32 . Taken together, these results indicate that the early dispersal of the Afanasievo herders into Dzungaria was accompanied by a substantial level of genetic mixing with local autochthonous populations, a pattern distinct from that of the initial formation of the Afanasievo culture in southern Siberia.Here we define autochthonous to signify a genetic profile that has been present in a region for millennia, rather than being associated with more recently arrived groups.

        <p>The Tarim_EMBA1 and Tarim_EMBA2 groups, although geographically separated by over 600 km of desert, form a homogeneous population that had undergone a substantial population bottleneck, as suggested by their high genetic affinity without close kinship, as well as by the limited diversity in their uniparental haplogroups (Figs. 1 and2, Extended Data Fig. 4, Extended Data Table 1, Supplementary Data 1B and Supplementary Text 4). Using qpAdm, we modelled the Tarim Basin individuals as a mixture of two ancient autochthonous Asian genetic groups: the ANE, represented by an Upper Palaeolithic individual from the Afontova Gora site in the upper Yenisei River region of Siberia (AG3) (about 72%), and ancient Northeast Asians, represented by Baikal_EBA (about 28%) (Supplementary Data 1E and Fig. 3a). Tarim_EMBA2 from Beifang can also be modelled as a mixture of Tarim_EMBA1 (about 89%) and Baikal_EBA (about 11%).

        <p>unanimously fail when using the Afanasievo or IAMC/BMAC groups as a western Eurasian source (Supplementary Data 1E), thus rejecting a western Eurasian genetic contribution from nearby groups with herding and/or farming economies. We estimate a deep formation date for the Tarim_EMBA1 genetic profile, consistent with an absence of western Eurasian EBA admixture, placing the origin of this gene pool at 183 generations before the sampled Tarim Basin individuals, or 9,157 ± 986 years ago when assuming an average generation time of 29 years (Fig. 3b). Considering these findings together, the genetic profile of the Tarim Basin individuals indicates that the earliest individuals of the Xiaohe horizon belong to an ancient and isolated autochthonous Asian gene pool. This autochthonous ANE-related gene pool is likely to have formed the genetic substratum of the pre-pastoralist ANE-related populations of Central Asia and southern Siberia (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Text 5).unanimously fail when using the Afanasievo or IAMC/BMAC groups as a western Eurasian source (Supplementary Data 1E), thus rejecting a western Eurasian genetic contribution from nearby groups with herding and/or farming economies.

        <p>Although the harsh environment of the Tarim Basin may have served as a strong barrier to gene flow into the region, it was not a barrier to the flow of ideas or technologies, as foreign innovations, such as dairy pastoralism and wheat and millet agriculture, came to form the basis of the Bronze Age Tarim economies. Woollen fabrics, horns and bones of cattle, sheep and goats, livestock manure, and milk and kefir-like dairy products have been recovered from the upper layers of the Xiaohe and Gumugou cemeteries [33][34][35][36] , as have wheat and millet seeds and bundles of Ephedra twigs 34,37,38 . Famously, many of the mummies dating to 1650-1450 bc were even buried with lumps of cheese 35 . However, until now it has not been clear whether this pastoralist lifestyle also characterized the earliest layers at Xiaohe. To better understand the dietary economy of the earliest archaeological periods, we analysed the dental calculus proteomes of seven individuals at the site of Xiaohe dating to around 2000-1700 bc. All seven individuals were strongly positive for ruminant-milk-specific proteins (Extended Data Table 2), including β-lactoglobulin, α-S1-casein and α-lactalbumin (Extended Data Fig. 5), and peptide recovery was sufficient to provide taxonomically diagnostic matches to cattle (Bos), sheep (Ovis) and goat (Capra) milk (Extended Data Fig. 5, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Data 3). These results confirm that dairy products were consumed by individuals of autochthonous ancestry (Tarim_EMBA1) buried in the lowest levels of the Xiaohe cemetery (Extended Data Table 2). Importantly, however, and in contrast to previous hypotheses 36 , none of the Tarim individuals was genetically lactase persistent (Supplementary Data 1J). Rather, the Tarim mummies contribute to a growing body of evidence that prehistoric dairy pastoralism in Inner and East Asia spread independently of lactase persistence genotypes 28,30Although the harsh environment of the Tarim Basin may have served as a strong barrier to gene flow into the region, it was not a barrier to the flow of ideas or technologies, as foreign innovations, such as dairy pastoralism and wheat and millet agriculture, came to form the basis of the Bronze Age Tarim economies.

        <p>Although human activities in Xinjiang can be traced back to around 40,000 years ago 24,39 , the earliest evidence for sustained human habitation in the Tarim Basin dates only to the late third to early second millennium bc.

        <p>Since their initial discovery in the early twentieth century and subsequent large-scale excavations beginning in the 1990s (ref. 16 ), the Tarim mummies have been at the centre of debates with regard to their origins, their relationship to other Bronze Age steppe (Afanasievo), oasis (BMAC) and mountain (IAMC and Chemurchek) groups, and their potential connection to the spread of Indo-European languages into this region 3,4,40 .Since their initial discovery in the early twentieth century and subsequent large-scale excavations beginning in the 1990s (ref. 16 ), the Tarim mummies have been at the centre of debates with regard to their origins, their relationship to other Bronze Age steppe (Afanasievo), oasis (BMAC) and mountain (IAMC and Chemurchek) groups, and their potential connection to the spread of Indo-European languages into this region 3,4,40 .</p>
        <p>The palaeogenomic and proteomic data we present here suggest a very different and more complex population history than previously proposed. Although the IAMC may have been a vector for transmitting cultural and economic factors into the Tarim Basin, the known sites from the IAMC do not provide a direct source of ancestry for the Xiaohe populations. Instead, the Tarim mummies belong to an isolated gene pool whose Asian origins can be traced to the early Holocene epoch. This gene pool is likely to have once had a much wider geographic distribution, and it left a substantial genetic footprint in the EMBA populations of the Dzungarian Basin, IAMC and southern Siberia. The Tarim mummies' so-called Western physical features are probably due to their connection to the Pleistocene ANE gene pool, and their extreme genetic isolation differs from the EBA Dzungarian, IAMC and Chemurchek populations, who experienced substantial genetic interactions with the nearby populations mirroring their cultural links, pointing towards a role of extreme environments as a barrier to human migration.The palaeogenomic and proteomic data we present here suggest a very different and more complex population history than previously proposed.

They made cheese from ruminant milk using a kefir-like fermentation 37 , perhaps learned from descendants of the Afanasievo, and they cultivated wheat, barley and millet 37,41 , crops that were originally domesticated in the Near East and northern China and which were introduced into Xinjiang no earlier than 3500 bc (refs. 8,42 ), probably via their IAMC neighbours 24 . They buried their dead with Ephedra twigs in a style reminiscent of the BMAC oasis cultures of Central Asia, and they also developed distinctive cultural elements not found among other cultures in Xinjiang or elsewhere, such as boat-shaped wooden coffins covered with cattle hides and marked by timber poles or oars, as well as an apparent preference for woven baskets over pottery 43,44 . Considering these findings together, it appears that the tightknit population that founded the Xiaohe horizon were well aware of different technologies and cultures outside the Tarim Basin and that they developed their unique culture in response to the extreme challenges of the Taklamakan Desert and its lush and fertile riverine oases 4 .In contrast to their marked genetic isolation, however, the populations of the Xiaohe horizon were culturally cosmopolitan, incorporating diverse economic elements and technologies with far-flung origins.

        <p>This study illuminates in detail the origins of the Bronze Age human populations in the Dzungarian and Tarim basins of Xinjiang. Notably, our results support no hypothesis involving substantial human migration from steppe or mountain agropastoralists for the origin of the Bronze Age Tarim mummies, but rather we find that the Tarim mummies represent a culturally cosmopolitan but genetically isolated autochthonous population. This finding is consistent with earlier arguments that the IAMC served as a geographic corridor and vector for regional cultural interaction that connected disparate populations from the fourth to the second millennium bc (refs. 24,25 ). While the arrival and admixture of Afanasievo populations in the Dzungarian Basin of northern Xinjiang around 3000 bc may have plausibly introduced Indo-European languages to the region, the material culture and genetic profile of the Tarim mummies from around 2100 bc onwards call into question simplistic assumptions about the link between genetics, culture and language and leave unanswered the question of whether the Bronze Age Tarim populations spoke a form of proto-Tocharian. Future archaeological and palaeogenomic research on subsequent Tarim Basin populations-and most importantly, studies of the sites and periods where first millennium ad Tocharian texts have been recovered-are necessary to understand the later population history of the Tarim Basin. Finally, the palaeogenomic characterization of the Tarim mummies has unexpectedly revealed one of the few known Holocene-era genetic descendant populations of the once widespread Pleistocene ANE ancestry profile. The Tarim mummy genomes thus provide a critical reference point for genetically modelling Holocene-era populations and reconstructing the population history of Asia.This study illuminates in detail the origins of the Bronze Age human populations in the Dzungarian and Tarim basins of Xinjiang.

        <p>Ancient DNA work was conducted in dedicated cleanroom laboratory facilities at the ancient DNA laboratories of Jilin University in Changchun and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1A). For the 33 individuals initially screened in this study, approximately 50 mg of dentine or bone powder was obtained per individual from either teeth or bones. DNA was extracted following established protocols 47 with slight modifications (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols. io.baksicwe). A subset of DNA extracts (n = 16) was subjected to a partial uracil-specific excision reagent repair following the methods described in ref. 48 (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1A). All 33 DNA extracts were built into double-stranded dual-index Illumina libraries. Libraries that were prepared in Jilin (n = 26) were directly shotgun sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X10 or HiSeq 4000 instrument using 2 × 150-base-pair (bp) chemistry, and those with endogenous human DNA higher than 10% (n = 12) were sent for deeper sequencing. One of the 12 individuals (XHBM1) was later excluded from this study owing to high modern human DNA contamination (Supplementary Data 1A). For libraries prepared at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, samples with 0.1% or more human DNA from the initial screening (n = 7) were further enriched for approximately 1.2 million nuclear SNPs and then deeper sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument using 2 × 150-bp chemistry. Together, a total of 18 individuals yielded sufficient high-quality ancient genomic data for downstream analyses (Extended Data Table 1).Ancient DNA work was conducted in dedicated cleanroom laboratory facilities at the ancient DNA laboratories of Jilin University in Changchun and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1A).

            <rs type="version">2.2.0</rs> (ref. 50 ). Merged reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hs37d5; GRCh37 with decoy sequences) using the

            <rs type="version">0.12.2</rs> (ref. 49 ). To minimize the effect of postmortem DNA damage on genotyping, we trimmed BAM files generated from samples treated (n = 11) or not (n = 7) with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) by soft-masking up to 10 bp on both ends of each read using the trimbam function on

        <p>We assessed the authenticity of our ancient DNA data as follows. First, we computed the proportion of C-to-T deamination errors at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the sequencing reads, and found that all samples exhibited postmortem damage patterns characteristic of ancient DNA (Supplementary Data 1A). We then estimated mitochondrial DNA contamination for all individuals using the Schmutzi v.1.5.1 program 54 .We assessed the authenticity of our ancient DNA data as follows.

        <p>To do this, we mapped adapter-trimmed reads to a 500-bp-extended revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) of the human mitochondrial genome (NC_012920.1) to preserve reads passing through the origin, and then wrapped up the alignment to the regular rCRS with the circularmapper v.1.1 (ref. 49 ). We successively ran the contDeam and schmutzi modules in the schmutzi program against the worldwide allele frequency database of 197 individuals to estimate the mitochondrial DNA contamination rate. Last, we estimated the nuclear contamination rate on men using ANGSD v.0.910 (ref. 55 ), on the basis of the principle that mens have only a single copy of the X chromosome, and thus contamination will introduce extra mismatches among reads in SNP sites but not in the flanking monomorphic sites.To do this, we mapped adapter-trimmed reads to a 500-bp-extended revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) of the human mitochondrial genome (NC_012920.1) to preserve reads passing through the origin, and then wrapped up the alignment to the regular rCRS with the circularmapper v.1.1 (ref. 49 ).

        <p>We compared the genome sequences of our ancient individuals to two sets of worldwide genotype panels, one based on the Affymetrix Axiom Genome-wide Human Origins 1 array (HumanOrigins; 593,124 autosomal SNPs) [56][57][58] and the other on the 1,240k dataset (1,233,013 autosomal SNPs including all of the HumanOrigins SNPs) 59 . We augmented both datasets by adding the Simons Genome Diversity Panel 60 and published ancient genomes (Supplementary Data 2A).We compared the genome sequences of our ancient individuals to two sets of worldwide genotype panels, one based on the Affymetrix Axiom Genome-wide Human Origins 1 array (HumanOrigins; 593,124 autosomal SNPs) [56][57][58] and the other on the 1,240k dataset (1,233,013 autosomal SNPs including all of the HumanOrigins SNPs) 59 .

        <p>We used pairwise mismatch rate (pmr) 61 and lcMLkin v0.5.0 (ref. 62 ), to determine the genetic relatedness between ancient individuals. We calculated pmr for all pairs of ancient individuals in this study using the autosomal SNPs in the 1,240k panel and kept individual pairs with at least 8,000 SNPs covered by both to remove noisy estimates from low-coverage samples. We used lcMLkin to validate our observation in pmr analysis and to distinguish between parent-offspring and full sibling pairs.We used pairwise mismatch rate (pmr) 61 and lcMLkin v0.5.0 (ref. 62 ), to determine the genetic relatedness between ancient individuals.

        <p>We aligned the adapter-trimmed reads to the rCRS NC_012920.1, and then generated the mitochondrial consensus sequence of each ancient individual using 
            <rs type="software">Geneious</rs> software v.
            <rs type="version">11.1.3</rs> (ref. 63 ;

            <rs type="software">HaploGrep</rs>
            <rs type="version">2</rs> (ref. 64 ). For the Y chromosome, we used lineage-informative SNPs from the International Society of Genetic Genealogy 2016 tree (https://isogg.org/tree/2016/index16.html). For these SNPs, we called each individual's genotype using 
            <rs type="software">bcftools</rs> v.

We subsequently removed all heterozygous genotype calls. Then we assigned each individual to a specific Y haplogroup by manually comparing the genotype calls with the International Society of Genetic Genealogy SNPs. Before variant calling, we filtered alignment data using the 
            <rs type="software">pysam library</rs> v.

            <rs type="url">https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</rs> to reduce false positive variants due to postmortem damage and modern human contamination. We kept an observed base only if it was from a read shorter than 100 bp and the base was more than 10 bp away from the read ends. For transition SNPs, we further removed aligned bases if they were from a read with no postmortem damage pattern (that is, no C-to-T or G-to-A substitution). We determined each individual's Y Article haplogroup primarily on the basis of the transversion SNPs and additionally considered transitions if transversions were insufficient.

        <p>We performed principal component analysis as implemented in 
            <rs type="software">smartpca</rs> v.

            <rs type="version">1.3.0</rs> (ref. 66 ). For ADMIXTURE, we removed genetic markers with minor allele frequency lower than 1% and pruned for linkage disequilibrium using the -indep-pairwise 200 25 0.2 option in 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">1.90</rs> (ref. 67 ). We used outgroup f 3 statistics 68 to obtain a measurement of genetic relationship of the target population to a set of the Eurasian populations since their divergence from an African outgroup. We calculated f 4 statistics with the 'f4mode: YES' function in the 
            <rs type="software">ADMIXTOOLS</rs> package 58 . f 3 and f 4 statistics were calculated using qp

        </p>
        <p>We characterized whether the Bronze Age Xinjiang individuals descended from genetically related parents by estimating the runs of homozygosity (ROH). ROH refers to segments of the genome where the two chromosomes in an individual are identical to each other owing to recent common ancestry. Therefore, the presence of long ROH segments strongly suggests that an individual's parents are related. We applied the hapROH method 69 using the Python library 
            <rs type="software">hapROH</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">0.3a4</rs> with default parameters. The method was developed to identify ROH from low-coverage genotype data typical of ancient DNA and is still robust enough to identify ROH for individuals with a coverage down to 0.5× (ref. 69 ). We reported the total sum of ROH longer than 4, 8, 12 and 20 cM, and visualized the results using

        <p>We modelled our ancient Xinjiang populations using the 
            <rs type="software">qpWave</rs>/ 
            <rs type="software">qpAdm</rs> programs (
            <rs type="software">qpWave</rs> v.

            <rs type="software">qpAdm</rs> v.810 (ref. 57 )). We used the following eight populations in the 1,240k dataset as the base set of outgroups (base) unless explicitly stated otherwise: Mbuti (n = 5), Natufian (n = 6), Onge (n = 2), Iran_N (n = 5), Villabruna (n = 1), Mixe (n = 3), Ami (n = 2), Anatolia_N (n = 23). This set includes an African outgroup (Mbuti), early Holocene Levantine hunter-gatherers (Natufian), Andamanese islanders (Onge), early Neolithic Iranians from the Tepe Ganj Dareh site (Iran_N), late Pleistocene Western European hunter-gatherers (Villabruna), Central Native Americans (Mixe), an indigenous group native to Taiwan (Ami) and Neolithic farmers from Anatolia (Anatolia_N). To compare competing models, we also took a 'rotating' approach, where we reciprocally added a source from a model to outgroups for a competing model. We specified which outgroups are used for all qpAdm models.
        </p>
        <p>We used 
            <rs type="software">DATES</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">753</rs> (ref. 26 ) for the dating of admixture events of the ancient populations with the pseudo-haploid genotype data under the simplified assumption that gene flow occurred as a single event, and assuming a generation time of 29 years (ref. 58 ). The 
            <rs type="software">DATES</rs> software measures the decay of ancestry covariance to infer the admixture time and estimates jackknife standard errors. In the parameter file for running DATES, we used the options binsize: 0.001, maxdis: 0.5, runmode: 1, qbin: 10 and lovalfit: 0.45 in every run on the pseudo-haploid genotype data. For each target population, we chose a pair of reference populations that we identified as good sources in the qpAdm analysis. In cases in which the qpAdm source had limited sample size or SNP coverage, we chose an alternative that had a similar genetic profile to the qpAdm source but with better data quality to enhance the statistical power of the DATES analysis (Supplementary Data 1D-G). For Dzungaria_EBA1 and Chemurchek, we used the Afanasievo (n = 20) and Baikal_EBA (n = 9) as the references. For Kumsay_EBA and Mereke_MBA, we used the Afanasievo (n = 20) and Baikal_EN (n = 15). For Dali_EBA, we used Tarim_EMBA1 (n = 12) and Baikal_EBA (n = 9). For Tarim_EMBA1, we used West_Siberia_N (n = 3) and DevilsCave_N (n = 4).

Final protein and peptide FDRs were 1.8% and 0.99%, respectively. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm 72 . After establishing the presence of the milk proteins β-lactoglobulin and α-S1-casein using these criteria, we expanded our analysis to accept further milk proteins identified on the basis of single peptides for high-scoring PSMs (&gt;60), which resulted in the additional identification of α-lactalbumin. Proteins that contained similar peptides that could not be differentiated on the basis of MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. All samples yielded proteomes typical of a dental calculus oral microbiome, and damage-associated modifications (N and Q deamidation) characteristic of ancient proteins were observed (Supplementary Data 3).
