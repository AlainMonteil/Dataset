        <p>The combination of U-Pb and Lu-Hf compositions measured in zircon crystals is a remarkably powerful isotopic couplet that provides measures on both the timing of mineral growth and the radiogenic enrichment of the source from which the zircon grew. The U-Pb age documents the timing of zircon crystallization/recrystallization and Hf isotopes inform on the degree to which the host melt was derived from a radiogenic reservoir (e.g. depleted mantle) versus an unradiogenic reservoir (e.g. ancient continental crust), or some mixture of these sources. The ease of generating large quantities of zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf data has been in large part facilitated by instrument advances. However, the dramatic increase in time constrained zircon Lu-Hf analyses in the Earth science community has brought to the fore the importance of careful data collection and reduction workflows, onto which robust geological interpretations may be based. In this work, we discuss the fundamentals of Lu-Hf isotopes in zircon, which then allows us to provide a robust, accessible, methodology for the assessment of data quality. Additionally, we discuss some novel techniques for: data visualizationthat facilitates better transparency of data interpretation; integration of geographic informationthat may reveal spatial trends where temporal trends were only apparent before; and some novel statistical evaluation toolsthat may provide more rigorous interand intra-sample comparisons.</p>
        <p>The past ten years have seen a dramatic increase in Lu-Hf analyses of zircon grains (Fig. 1). Such burgeoning datasets require a data reduction workflow based around the demonstration of data quality as well as utilization of statistical tools to systematically extract information out of datasets that may be large and complex. As a prelude to discussing means of demonstrating data quality and data visualization, we provide a brief introduction to Lu-Hf systematics in zircon and discuss their utility when coupled to zircon geochronology.</p>
        <p>Lutetium is naturally monoisotopic with one dominant radioactive isotope ( 176 Lu) forming ~3% of the total Lu with the remaining ~97% ( 175 Lu) being stable. Radioactive 176 Lu has a half-life of ~37.8 Ga which makes it a prime candidate as a radiogenic isotopic tracer and geochronometer of the protracted geological history of Earth. The major mode of radioactive decay of 176 Lu produces 176 Hf through beta minus decay (β À ). There are currently a number of decay constant estimates that range from ~1.7E-11/yr to ~1. 96E-11/yr (Albar ede et al., 2006). Although constraining the decay constant of nuclides decaying by β-emission has proven difficult, lending to a wide range of λ 176 Lu, age comparison of terrestrial materials has yielded a more consistent λ 176 Lu of 1.867 AE 0.013 (Scherer et al., 2001;S€ oderlund et al., 2004;Albar ede et al., 2006). Using the decay constant, the age equation can be used to calculate the 176 Hf at the time of zircon formation: 176 Hf present ¼ 176 Hf initial þ 176 Lu Â (e λt -1) Lu-Hf isotopes in zircon are not used as a geochronometer senso stricto, but are generally used as an isotopic 'tracer', i.e. they are used to trace the source of the melt that the zircon crystallised from based upon the Hf isotopic ratio. To facilitate easier comparison of Hf isotopic ratios, a general assumption is applied; the Hf isotopic composition of the bulk Earth has evolved from a source with a Lu/Hf ratio equivalent to that of chondritic meteorites (Blichert-Toft and Albar ede, 1997; Fisher and Vervoort, 2018). Measured isotopic compositions are normalized to this so-called Chrondritic Uniform Reservoir (CHUR) (DePaolo and Wasserburg, 1976;Blichert-Toft et al., 1999;Vervoort et al., 1999;Patchett et al., 2004;Bouvier et al., 2008). This approach yields numbers that are larger and, in some respects, easier to compare than isotopic ratios whose significant deviation, for geological purposes, can be on the order of 100 ppm or less. The epsilon notion is used to easily visualize the isotopic composition with respect to CHUR and is calculated using the following equation:</p>
        <p>Estimates of the present day 176 Lu/ 177 Hf of CHUR range from 0.0332 to 0.0336 and 176 Hf/ 177 Hf range from 0.282772 to 0.282785 (Blichert-Toft and Albar ede, 1997;Bouvier et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>The other model reservoir that is used to normalize Hf measurements is Depleted Mantle. Lu and Hf are incompatible trace elements and relatively immobile. However, Hf is more incompatible (hence concentrated in the melt phase of magma) than Lu, so Hf is relatively enriched in silicates melts and the crust. Thus, a higher Lu/Hf elemental ratio (also meaning a higher 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratio over time) is generally found in the residual solid during partial melting and removal of a liquid from the reservoir. Estimates of the isotopic composition of the present-day Depleted Mantle have varied slightly over time as more precise and more comprehensive data have become available. A recent 'best estimate' yielded a 176 Lu/ 177 Hf of 0.03976 and a 176 Hf/ 177 Hf of 0.283238 (Vervoort et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>The wide isotopic dissimilarity between the present-day composition of CHUR and magmatic rocks derived directly from the mantle (midocean ridge basalts) with highly supra-CHUR (radiogenic) values has been taken to imply that the terrestrial isotopic reservoir from which all crust was derived (i.e. the mantle) was itself formed during planetary differentiation (Vervoort and Blichert-Toft, 1999;Salters and Stracke, 2004). Using the modelled initial composition of CHUR and Depleted Mantle, the isotopic evolution of these reservoirs can be tracked through geologic time to the formation of the Earth. Previously, it has been proposed that elevated 142 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios, which in many respects are analagous to 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios, point to the formation of an isotopic reservoir that is depleted in incompatible elements within the first 30-75 million years following the formation of the Earth (Boyet and Carlson, 2005;Bennett et al., 2007). Furthermore, unradiogenic hafnium signatures in Hadean zircon crystals from the Jack Hills of Western Australia have been argued as evidence for a complimentary 'enriched' isotopic reservoir during the Hadean Eon (Harrison et al., 2005(Harrison et al., , 2008;;Blichert-Toft and Albar ede, 2008;Kemp et al., 2010;Wang and Wilde, 2018). Nevertheless, it is important to note that, despite evidence from 142 Nd and Hadean zircon with unradiogenic Hf compositions, the earliest excursion of Hf isotopes in mafic (and presumed mantle-derived) rocks from CHUR is proposed to have occurred at ~3.8 Ga (Fisher and Vervoort, 2018). This observation implies that global mantle differentiation and incompatible element depletion did not occur until ca. 3.8 Ga and that the unradiogenic signatures of Hadean zircon may very well be a consequence of small-scale and significantly fractionated melts.</p>
        <p>Previous workers have also attempted to characterize other isotopic compositions in natural reservoirs. Dhuime et al. (2011) compiled the Lu-Hf isotopic composition of modern island arcs, and demonstrated that these have average compositions less radiogenic than the Depleted Mantle; the cause of this less radiogenic signature is due to contamination of mantle-derived melts from subducted sediment and assimilated crust. Dhuime et al. (2011) proposed a novel average isotopic composition of 'new crust' which they suggest should be used to calculate model ages. Nonetheless, Depleted Mantle serves as a more useful composition as it is more easily defined and, in theory, represents an end-member composition. New Crust on the other hand is the average of a very wide-range of compositions, and is not an end-member since its composition is known to arise from a mixture of sourcesi.e. old sediment and crust mixed with mantle (White and Patchett, 1984;Plank, 2005;Chauvel et al., 2008).</p>
        <p>Evaluation of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf in zircon is best placed in the context of CHUR and DM reservoirs. Just as with the evolution of CHUR and Depleted Mantle, the isotopic evolution in zircon itself is controlled by zircon 176 Lu/ 177 Hf which is extremely low. This means that any radiogenic ingrowth is minimal, and hence, the age correction to derive the initial ratio is small. However, any melt from which zircon grows will have a Lu/Hf ratio (in all likelihood) much greater than that in the zircon grain itself. The 176 Lu/ 177 Hf of terrestrial materials can be estimated using known isotopic abundances and elemental ratios:</p>
        <p>Hf ¼ Lu ppm Hf ppm Â Iso:wt:Lu Iso:wt:Hf Â Iso:abun:Lu Iso:abun:Hf Â At:wt:Hf At:wt:Lu Using elemental ratios of various crustal reservoirs, the 176 Lu/ 177 Hf of the crust ranges from ~0.026 (lower continental crust) to 0.01 (upper continental crust). For ease of use, the 176 Lu/ 177 Hf evolution trajectory can be estimated as a function of εHf/Ma (Table 1) using the following equation:</p>
        <p>The 176 Lu/ 177 Hf evolution trajectory is thus useful in calculating the time at which the 176 Hf/ 177 Hf of the sample may have been the same as various isotopic reservoirs (CHUR or Depleted Mantle).</p>
        <p>Partial melting will preferentially partition Hf strongly into the silicate melt, whereas Lu will reside in the residuum (Lu is less incompatible). Hence, as mantle rocks contain elevated Lu they will develop 176 Hf/ 177 Hf that changes more significantly over time than crustal rocks. In contrast, crustal rocks have 176 Hf/ 177 Hf that will only change slightly from the time of mantle extraction due to low Lu content and lower Lu/Hf.</p>
        <p>Natural variations in 176 Hf/ 177 Hf are very small and there is the need for high precision in any measurement capable of addressing geological questions. Zircon has a high Hf content and low Lu content and can be readily dated. Therefore, zircon is highly suitable for 176 Hf/ 177 Hf measurement and calculation of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf initial ratios. However, there are specific analytical challenges that must be overcome. Isobaric interferences of Yb and Lu at mass 176 must be corrected for and this correction must be evaluated to ensure the interferences have been adequately dealt with (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>The fractionation between heavy and light isotopes needs to be corrected, and the effect of isobaric interferences needs to be stripped from measured ratios of interest. The 177 Hf/ 179 Hf ratio can serve as a measure of this mass bias for the Hf isotopes and a correction applied on 176 Hf/ 177 Hf. This is a significant magnitude of correction. As with Hf mass bias fractionation, Yb fractionation also needs to be measured and corrected. Typically, 171 Yb/ 173 Yb will be measured and a correction factor determined, which in most cases is also substantial (&gt;1%/atomic mass unit). A fractionation-corrected 173 Yb/ 176 Yb signal can then be calculated. The calculated 176 Yb (fractionation-corrected) needs to be removed from the 176 X signal, which can be accomplished by measuring 171 Yb, applying the determined mass bias correction and using a known fixed 171 Yb/ 176 Yb ratio. The remaining isobaric interference on 176 Hf now is only from 176 Lu. Lu has two isotopes ( 175 Lu and 176 Lu) so it is not possible to directly measure a mass bias. Therefore, fractionation of Lu is assumed to be equivalent to fractionation of Yb. Fortunately, Lu interference on 176 X is minimal so if this assumption is inaccurate, it has little effect on calculated final 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratio. The fraction-corrected 175 Lu/ 176 Lu ratio is used to calculate the abundance of 176 Hf free of 176 Lu interference. As can be appreciated from this preamble, correction for mass basis and interference is non-trivial and a range of strategies is presented to demonstrate that a correction approaches efficacy.</p>
        <p>The Hf isotopic system benefits from the existence of several stable isotopes (e.g. 177 Hf, 178 Hf, 180 Hf). Hence the stable isotope ratios can provide a useful measure of confidence in instrument stability and the accuracy of mass bias corrections. Based upon known atomic weights and proportions, the 178 Hf/ 177 Hf and 180 Hf/ 177 Hf are 1.46717 and 1.88666, respectively (Blichert-Toft and Albar ede, 1997). Long term analysis of Hf isotopes via inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) indicates long term reproducibility with ~200 ppm, with reproducibility being calculated with the following equation:</p>
        <p>Multi-year compilations (&gt;3 years) of stable Hf isotope ratios from two different laboratories running different mass spectrometers and laser ablation systems provide a useful benchmark to compare future Hf studies. We consider analyses that lie within 200 ppm of the natural stable ratios to be a useful indication that the instrument is performing adequately. This corresponds to 178 Hf/ 177 Hf between 1.46746 and 1.46688 and 180 Hf/ 177 Hf between 1.88704 and 1.88628 (Fig. 3). Analyses outside of these acceptable ranges may suffer inaccurate mass bias corrections or other unforeseen aberrations in the resulting data.</p>
        <p>Accurate radiogenic Hf isotope measurement requires a number of isobaric interference corrections. These corrections include the removal of 176 Yb and 176 Lu from the measured 176 mass. While there are a range of strategies to accomplish this correction (Thirlwall and Walder, 1995;Nowell and Parrish, 2001;Xu et al., 2004;Iizuka and Hirata, 2005;Wu et al., 2006;Blichert-Toft, 2008;Fisher et al., 2014), the evaluation of the resultant corrected 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratio (and εHf) is facilitated through Analysis of a range of reference materials with varying 176 Lu/ 177 Hf and 176 Yb/ 177 Hf ratios provides a useful means of validating isobaric interference corrections. Similar to other elemental and isotopic measurements, it is important that the composition of the reference material brackets that of the unknowns. The range of compositions shown in Fig. 5 allows for the appropriate reference materials to be selected based on the composition of the unknown material. A compilation of ~26,000 analyses (Roberts and Spencer, 2015) demonstrates the vast majority of natural zircon have 176 Lu/ 177 Hf between 0.0001 and 0.002 and 176 Yb/ 177 Hf between 0.008 and 0.2 (Fig. 5). This range of isotopic compositions can be encompassed by using Mudtank or Ple sovice (Jackson et al., 2004;Sl ama et al., 2008) on the lower isotopic side and R33 or the Memorial University synthetic zircon (doped with Yb) on the higher side (Fisher et al., 2011(Fisher et al., , 2014)). We also suggest that a selected reference material should match the mode of unknown zircon composition for robustness.</p>
        <p>When estimating the uncertainty of any measurement, it is important to identify all of the possible sources of uncertainty including random (analytical) and systematic (Horstwood et al., 2016). Given the time-integrated nature of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf (t) and εHf (t) , it is important to consider the age uncertainty in conjunction with the Hf isotopic uncertainty. In a scenario where the age uncertainty is considered, the time-integrated uncertainty will broadly form a rhombus-shaped or elliptical envelope with vertical age-constraints and sloped connecting lines constrained by the 176 Lu/ 177 Hf of the zircon analysis. However, in practice, we suggest simply using the maximum and minimum 176 Hf/ 177 Hf (t) or εHf (t) of the time-integrated uncertainty in conjunction with the age uncertainty (Fig. 6). Although this approach likely over-estimates the 176 Hf/ 177 Hf (t) and εHf (t) uncertainty, we prefer this conservative approach when defining specific fields of similar Hf isotopic compositions (Spencer et al., 2019b). For instance, incorporating the crystallization age uncertainty (~2% age uncertainty from LA-ICPMS data) produces Hf isotope uncertainties that are ~50% larger, on average, than estimates that do not consider crystallization age and time-integrated uncertainty. Fig. 5. Compilation of natural zircon analyses (blue spots) of 176 Yb/ 177 Hf versus 176 Lu/ 177 Hf. Frequency of 176 Yb/ 177 Hf and 176 Lu/ 177 Hf are shown as probability density curves along the axes (Spencer et al., 2017). Ranges of reference material compositions are shown in colored bars for Mudtank, Plesovice, 91500, MunZirc2 (Woodhead and Hergt, 2005;Morel et al., 2008;Sl ama et al., 2008;Fisher et al., 2011Fisher et al., , 2014) ) as analysed by multiple laboratories over a multi-year period of time. Published median values for Mudtank, Plesovice, 91500, FC1, R33, MunZirc2 are shown in dashed lines.</p>
        <p>Theorized isotopic reservoirs can be used as reference frames within which isotopic enrichment or depletion can be compared. In general, CHUR has become the most useful reference frame through the epsilon notation. Those data that have a supra-CHUR composition can be characterized as more radiogenic (i.e. there is elevated 176 Hf produced from a source with greater Lu than CHUR) whereas the sub-CHUR composition is unradiogenic (i.e. there is less 176 Hf produced from a source with less Lu than CHUR). Additionally, the Depleted Mantle can be a useful reference frame that allows for interpretations to integrate planetary differentiation and isotopic depletion of the mantle. The ability to track the 176 Hf/ 177 Hf isotopic composition of the Depleted Mantle through geologic time allows for the calculation of 'Depleted Mantle model ages' or the average 'age' of Depleted Mantle extraction. These are two stage model ages which project back in time from the present to zircon crystallization age using the 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio of the zircon and then in the stage prior to zircon growth using a chosen average crustal 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio. The limitations and utility of these model ages has been discussed at length elsewhere (Arndt et al., 1987;Roberts and Spencer, 2015;Payne et al., 2016;Vervoort and Kemp, 2016). Suffice it to say that Depleted Mantle model ages are generally not 'ages' of geologic events, but are numerical estimates of average mantle extraction ages. Only in rare cases can it be demonstrated through independent means that model age tracks a real crust production episode (Kemp et al., 2006;Nebel et al., 2007;Kirkland et al., 2013;Vervoort and Kemp, 2016). Hence, in most cases model ages should not be used to define the timing of geologic events as they rely on assumptions about the composition of parental material. Based on these assumptions, model ages then provide an indication of the potential age of the parent material. Using the isotopic estimates of the Depleted Mantle discussed above (Vervoort et al., 2018) and the timing of global mantle depletion at ~3.8 Ga (Fisher and Vervoort, 2018) we can state that, depending on the timing of mantle extraction and degree of radiogenic enrichment, either Depleted Mantle model ages (T DM ) or CHUR model ages (T CHUR ) are most appropriate when considering a specific data set (Fig. 7). For zircon with a Hf isotopic composition above the average crustal 176 Lu/ 177 Hf evolution trajectory that projects from 3.8 Ga (the timing of mantle depletion), Depleted Mantle model ages are appropriate. Conversely, for zircon with a Hf isotopic composition below the average crustal isotopic evolution trajectory, CHUR model ages are appropriate simply because Depleted Mantle extraction may have not yet occurred on the evolving planet.</p>
        <p>Radiogenic ingrowth over time leads to linear arrays on hafnium evolution plots. In addition, isotopic evolution slopes are controlled by age. Hence, a well constrained age for initial isotopic ratio calculation (i.e. 176 Lu/ 177 Hf) is critical. The slope of isotopic evolution arrays can, therefore, provide important information regarding the nature of the source material and the long-term history of the isotopic system. Plots of 176 Hf/ 177 Hf versus zircon crystallization age provide a useful indication of whether the slope of the isotopic evolution array can be explained by crustal reworking, Depleted Mantle input, mixtures of these sources, or Pb-loss having affected the age used in initial calculations. A trend attributed to Pb-loss will be (near) horizontal when displayed in 176 Hf/ 177 Hf versus age space. This Pb loss array would correspond to a 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio of zero, and plot as a steep trend in εHf versus age space but may be difficult to distinguish from natural compositional trends on a εHf plot. It is commonly assumed that an isotopic composition of 176 Lu/ 177 Hf between 0.010 and 0.015 approximates the isotopic evolution of the average continental crust (Vervoort and Blichert-Toft, 1999;Griffin et al., 2002;Roberts et al., 2013). Mafic lithologies will have 176 Lu/ 177 Hf greater than the average continental crust, and felsic lithologies will have a lower ratio. When converted to εHf, the isotopic evolution array will correspond to an εHf/Ma slope. Although a 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio of zero (i.e. as expected for Pb-loss) corresponds to an εHf/Ma slope of 0.022, determination of Pb-loss is most easily facilitated using a 176 Hf/ 177 Hf versus age plot (not εHf versus age). The slopes of linear regressions of εHf/Ma can be used to estimate the 176 Lu/ 177 Hf of the source using the equation discussed above.</p>
        <p>Important discussions regarding the interpretation of the 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio and crustal evolution trajectories in complex dataset that often exhibit radiogenic Pb-loss are presented elsewhere (Griffin et al., 2004;Laurent and Zeh, 2015;Payne et al., 2016;Vervoort and Kemp, 2016).</p>
        <p>Although the εHf/Ma slope and corresponding 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio are most generally used to define the isotopic evolution trajectory and interpreted to be controlled by the composition of the host rocks, it has been proposed this slope can also be used to infer changes in the geodynamic environment responsible for the crustal reworking (Spencer et al., 2018). For example, a εHf/Ma slope that corresponds to a negative (and therefore implausible) 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratio may simply be indicative of collisional orogenesis where the reworking of progressively older crust leads to a steepened εHf/Ma slope (Kohanpour et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>It is often the case that zircon Hf ratios yield a range of isotopic values despite being from a single igneous sample with robust isobaric interference corrections and a single U-Pb crystallization age (Andersen et al., 2002;Griffin et al., 2002;Roberts et al., 2013;Hartnady et al., 2019). This variance of composition has been explained as being due to disequilibrium Fig. 7. Evolution of Hf isotopes shown in 176 Hf/ 177 Hf and εHf through time. Large-scale mantle depletion is hypothesized to have occurred at ~3.8 Ga (Fisher and Vervoort, 2018) and therefore Depleted Mantle model ages greater than ~3.8 Ga are likely overestimates of mantle melting. of the magma composition (Villaros et al., 2009;Tang et al., 2014) or magma mixing (Griffin et al., 2002;Belousova et al., 2006;Kemp et al., 2007). Regardless of the petrological reason for the wide range of zircon εHf compositions within a single magmatic system, the visualization of such data generally cannot be effectively accomplished via a simple arithmetic, geometric, or weighted mean (AE2 standard deviations). For weighted means, it is important to evaluate the reduced chi-squared statistic (mean square weighted deviation, MSWD) and whether or not the data display over-or under-dispersion (Spencer et al., 2016). Many scholars make use of histograms or probability density functions; however these diagrams do not allow for the samples to be placed in their temporal context. For this reason, a useful tool for displaying Hf data is a violin plot, where the distribution of εHf is displayed as a vertical density function mirrored on the vertical axis and placed in its proper temporal location along the horizontal axis (Fig. 8). This approach provides a means to clearly show data frequency and the range of isotopic compositions, while simultaneously correctly showing the temporal context. Violin plots can be constructed using a variety of software packages (

        </p>
        <p>When displaying large compiled databases of zircon Hf data, scatterplots are often used to visualize the data. However, these diagrams cannot quantitatively treat data density. In 1-dimensional distributions (such as detrital zircon age spectra), kernel density estimations have proven to be useful to provide a relative likelihood of different ages in the population (Botev et al., 2010;Vermeesch, 2012). In most cases, the kernel density estimation simply adds gaussian curves (the kernel) of a given bandwidth to form a single smooth curve. The selection of the bandwidth is important as this will control the smoothness of the curve. If the bandwidth is too narrow, then the distribution will be under-smoothed and may give an invalid perception of the frequency of meaningful age populations (showing a single age population as multiple peaks). If the bandwidth is too wide, it will mask multiple age populations within a single peak. While there are a number of strategies for choosing the most appropriate bandwidth (Vermeesch, 2012), we recommend that the kernel density bandwidth is set to meet the fundamental limitations of the analytical equipment used (i.e., average zircon age uncertainty).</p>
        <p>The same kernel density estimation approach can be accomplished in two dimensions with zircon U-Pb and εHf to create a bivariate kernel density estimation diagram (Fig. 9) (Botev et al., 2010;Spencer et al., 2019b). Importantly, the kernel density estimation algorithm should use independent bandwidths for U-Pb and εHf (e.g., 20 Ma for U-Pb and 1 epsilon unit for εHf, or the average age and εHf uncertainties; Spencer et al., 2019b).</p>
        <p>The Nd isotope system has long been used to track crustal evolution. A powerful way of visualising such information has been to contour initial ratios or model ages to produce maps that may track zones of reworking or enhanced mantle input (Milisenda et al., 1988(Milisenda et al., , 1994;;Herrell et al., 2006;Dickin and Strong, 2019) and may delineate metallogenic tracks (Cassidy et al., 2004;Champion and Cassidy, 2007;Wyche et al., 2012). More recently, the Hf isotope system has been utilised in a similar way but with some important advantages (Kirkland et al., 2011;Mole et al., 2015). Each Hf isotope analysis of zircon may be time constrained with its U-Pb age, Range of εHf values of the younger population implies a degree of mixing between the Depleted Mantle and the isotopically evolved composition of the older population. The distribution of data of the younger population implies that mixing of the old crust was greater than that of the Depleted Mantle.

        <p>removing ambiguity in initial ratio determination in whole rock Nd approaches. Furthermore, as each analysis of zircon has an associated location and an age, the Hf isotopic signature can be used to develop time dynamic images of the development of crust (Fig. 10). On many occasions, each specific location within a Hf isotopic map can be constrained at different points in time, with associated unique Hf ratios, as samples may contain older inherited zircons. While such inherited zircon may blur the spatial resolution, they do provide further temporal resolution. There are several approaches to collating data sets suitable for Hf isotopic mapping, the most common being age bin averaging, where the median of isotopic values for each sample for a given age range is computed and the median value spatially interpolated between different sample locations. The age span of the bin can be changed with pay offs in terms of sample density versus temporal resolution. Isotopic maps have been produced for both initial ratios and model ages. Many interpolation and approximation methods have been developed to predict values of spatial phenomena in unsampled locations (Franke, 1982;Lam, 1983;Burrough, 1986;McCullagh, 1988;Franke and Nielson, 1991;Watson, 1999) and this is readily accomplished in GIS applications. One widely used approach in Hf isotopic mapping is inverse distance weighting, which assumes that the value at an unsampled point can be approximated as a weighted average of values at points within a certain cut-off distance, or from a given number m of the closest points (typically 15). Weights are usually inversely proportional to a power of distance (Burrough, 1986;Watson, 1999) which, at an unsampled location, leads to an estimator. In the case of time dynamic maps (e.g. animated maps), it is feasible to implement between bin morphing, where the calculated isotopic grid is morphed into the next age bin grid over a number of temporal steps. Basically, this approach is temporal interpolation as opposed to spatial interpolation and is carried out between two end-member grids to yield an animation showing how the isotopic parameter may have changed over both space and time.</p>
        <p>It should be remembered that such visualization techniques, although based on measured data, are still only models as they necessitate assumptions in both spatial and temporal dimensions. An animation of the temporal change between 3.0 Ga and 2.2 Ga in two-stage Depleted Mantle model ages across the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, is presented in Supplementary Fig. 2 produced from a compilation of available zircon Hf isotopic data in the region. The Hf isotopic pattern reveals breaks and gradients that correspond to known zones of mineralization, including gold, and the location of Komatiite volcanism (Mole et al., 2015). A distinct feature of this animation is the development of the relatively more juvenile Eastern Goldfield Superterrane across the Ida Fault and an earlier juvenile mantle corridor running NNE-SSW, developing at 3.0 Ga, between the towns of Que and Meekatharra, where several large vanadium bearing ca. 2.8 Ga mafic bodies are concentrated (Ivanic et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Hf isotopes allow a wide range of geological questions to be addressed, such as, what is the proportion of magmatic addition from the mantle to the crust? How does the source of magma change over time? Where are major crustal structures? Furthermore, due to the ability to delineate major crustal structures, spatial relationships in isotopic signatures can have metallogenic significance. Despite the clear power of time constrained Hf isotopes to address questions on crustal evolution, measurement of Hf isotopes in zircon is non-trivial, requiring five corrections for mass bias and interference to allow meaningful 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios to be calculated. Additionally, the precision of measurement needed to address geological questions necessitates accurate measurement to the 5th decimal place.</p>
        <p>The work flow that is presented in this study (Inline Supplementary Fig. S1), provides a baseline to help assure that the steps taken towards data correction and interpretation are robust and rooted in fundamental geologic, isotopic, and analytical constraints. This workflow in no way represents the only method through which Hf isotopes of zircon can be interpreted, but merely provides suggestions towards our view of best practice. (Kirkland et al., 2011).
