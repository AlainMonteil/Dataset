        <p>The Permian-Triassic mass extinction was marked by a massive release of carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system, evidenced by a sharp negative carbon isotope excursion. Large carbon emissions would have increased atmospheric pCO 2 and caused global warming. However, the magnitude of pCO 2 changes during the PTME has not yet been estimated. Here, we present a continuous pCO 2 record across the PTME reconstructed from highresolution δ 13 C of C 3 plants from southwestern China. We show that pCO 2 increased from 426 +133/-96 ppmv in the latest Permian to 2507 +4764/-1193 ppmv at the PTME within about 75 kyr, and that the reconstructed pCO 2 significantly correlates with sea surface temperatures. Mass balance modelling suggests that volcanic CO 2 is probably not the only trigger of the carbon cycle perturbation, and that large quantities of 13 C-depleted carbon emission from organic matter and methane were likely required during complex interactions with the Siberian Traps volcanism.</p>
        <p>T he Permian-Triassic mass extinction (PTME; ca. 252 Ma) coincided with rapid global warming that produced one of the hottest intervals of the Phanerozoic [1][2][3][4][5] , which was likely triggered by a massive release of greenhouse gases 6,7 . The emplacement of the Siberian Traps large igneous province has been widely suggested as the ultimate trigger for the extinction of ~90% of marine species and ~70% of terrestrial vertebrate species at the Permian-Triassic boundary 8 , with major losses amongst plants (e.g. refs. 9,10 ). Alongside volcanic degassing, CO 2 , SO 2, and halogen volatiles were likely released due to thermal metamorphism by Siberian Traps' intrusions into organic-rich sediments 6,7,11 . The global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) found in both marine and terrestrial settings at the PTME (for a review, ref. 12 ) indicates a major carbon cycle perturbation in the ocean-atmosphere system, which implies a rise in the atmospheric CO 2 levels (pCO 2 ). However, pCO 2 changes during the PTME still remain poorly constrained.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, records of pCO 2 from proxies (stomata index, palaeosol carbonates, and biomarkers) are mainly focused on the late Permian and/or Phanerozoic long-term trends without detailed pCO 2 data for the earliest Triassic (refs. [13][14][15][16][17] ). On the other hand, various models show large variability of peak pCO 2 estimates, because of the different assumed background pCO 2 levels (e.g. refs. [18][19][20] ). Hence, there is a pressing need for a continuous proxy-based and high-resolution record of pCO 2 during the PTME. Understanding the magnitude of pCO 2 changes during past hyperthermals is indeed crucial to understand the possible imminent environmental effects of today's CO 2 increase: pCO 2 has risen from 280 to more than 400 ppmv in the last 150 years and is projected to go higher 21 .</p>
        <p>Experiments on living C 3 plants (in the field and in growth chambers) suggest that carbon isotope fractionation (Δ 13 C) during photosynthesis increases with increasing CO 2 levels, lowering the carbon isotope signature of C 3 plants (δ 13 C p ) 22 . Based on this relationship, Δ 13 C calculated from δ 13 C p measured in fossil C 3 plants remains can be used as a proxy for past pCO 2 23 . This proxy successfully reproduced ice-core records of pCO 2 for the Last Glacial Maximum 23 , and has been applied to reconstruct pCO 2 during Early Eocene hyperthermals 24 , the Cretaceous Period 25 , and the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event 26 .</p>
        <p>Here, we present high-resolution δ 13 C records of fossil C 3 plant remains from sedimentary successions of southwestern China. Using the δ 13 C data of C 3 plants, we calculated a six-fold increase of atmospheric pCO 2 during the PTME, from 426 +133/-96 ppmv to 2507 +4764/-1193 ppmv. Furthermore, the pCO 2 estimates are compared with carbon isotope mass balance calculations showing that in addition to volcanic CO 2 , large quantities of 13 C-depleted carbon emission from organic matter and methane were likely required to trigger the observed global negative CIE in the exogenic carbon pool.</p>
        <p>High-resolution terrestrial carbon isotope records. We present high-resolution terrestrial organic carbon isotope records (δ 13 C org ) from plant cuticles, wood and bulk organic matter (OM) together with our previous work 10 from four terrestrial Permian-Triassic boundary sections (Chahe, Jiucaichong, core ZK4703 and Chinahe) in southwestern China (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. 2). The δ 13 C of bulk OM and C 3 plant remains from the four study sections exhibit nearly identical secular trends (Fig. 1). Each profile can be divided into four stages: (1) a pre-CIE stage, (2) an onset of the negative CIE (onset of CIE) stage, (3) a prolonged CIE body stage and (4) a post-CIE stage. In the pre-CIE stage, δ 13 C org records from the Xuanwei Formation are characterized by steady values around -25.0% (Fig. 1). The synchronous, prominent onset of CIEs with peak values of -32% occurs at the bottom of the Kayitou Formation. Subsequently, the onset of the CIE stage is followed by a prolonged interval with sustained low values (ca. -30%) through the whole Kayitou Formation, interrupted by a slight positive shift immediately after the onset of CIE. A recovery to slightly higher δ 13 C org values (-28% to -26%) starts in the uppermost part of the Kayitou Formation and the Dongchuan Formation. Previously published terrestrial δ 13 C org profiles in southwestern China (e.g. refs. 27,28 ) all belong to mixed organic carbon source The last appearance datum (LAD) of coal beds and Gigantopteris flora distributions represent the coal gap and collapse of tropical peatlands respectively 10,45 . Carbon isotope (δ 13 C) data source: Chahe (δ 13 C of bulk organic matter from ref. 27 ; δ 13 C of plants data from this study), Jiucaichong (this study), ZK4703 core and Chinahe (δ 13 C data in this study together with our previous work 10 ), Amb (Pakistan) 32 and global marine carbonate δ 13 C (Methods). The locations of marine and terrestrial carbon isotope profiles are shown in the late Permian palaeogeographic map.</p>
        <p>in bulk OM. Few unusually negative values (&lt; -34%) observed in the upper Kayitou Formation, e.g., in a published record from Chahe 27 , are statistical outliers and local signals, as such negative values are not observed in our high-resolution study. These outliers may be caused by local 13 C-depleted samples possibly containing an algal and/or bacterial component 29 . The four-stage terrestrial δ 13 C org trend is also seen in the marine carbonate carbon isotope (δ 13 C carb ) records (Fig. 1). A total of 10 global-distributed marine Permian-Triassic boundary sections with both high-resolution δ 13 C carb and conodont biostratigraphy were integrated as a global marine δ 13 C carb profile, using the age model from the Meishan Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) 30 (Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. 4). These newly compiled global δ 13 C carb records are nearly identical to those published previously (e.g. ref. 12 ). pCO 2 estimates based on Δ 13 C of fossil plants. Constraining the magnitude of the CIE is crucial to estimate accurate mass, rate, and source of the 13 C-depleted carbon released during the PTME 20 . CIE magnitudes show large variations between different localities and substrates because they can be affected by multiple factors 31 . δ 13 C p profiles from southwestern China (low latitude) and Pakistan 32 (middle latitude) exhibit CIE magnitudes of ca.</p>
        <p>-7% and ca. -5.5% respectively, which are significantly larger than the ca. -3.5% marine CIE magnitude estimated from global marine δ 13 C carb records (Fig. 1). Data compilation confirms this discrepancy: terrestrial CIE magnitudes range from -3.6% to -6.1% (bulk OM, 25th percentile to 75th percentile, n = 29), and from -5.2% to -7.1% (C 3 plants, n = 9), whereas marine CIE magnitudes range from -3.0% to -4.7% (n = 69) (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 1). As shown both in modern and fossil plants, elevated atmospheric pCO 2 was likely responsible for amplifying the magnitude of the CIE in the terrestrial δ 13 C p record due to an increase of Δ 13 C 22,33 . Therefore, following the relationship between Δ 13 C and pCO 2 developed by Cui and Schubert 24 (Methods), we could calculate the pCO 2 across the PTME. The Δ 13 C was calculated using the δ 13 C p records of four study sections from southwestern China, and the δ 13 C CO2 (the δ 13 C of atmospheric CO 2 ; Supplementary Fig. 5) calculated from the global marine δ 13 C carb compiled in this study. As explained above, this is possible because the marine and terrestrial δ 13 C records are closely comparable and can be readily correlated (Fig. 1), the correlation being supported also by biostratigraphy (flora and conchostracans), and radioisotope dating (Supplementary Fig. 6; Supplementary Information). The initial, background late Permian pCO 2(t = 0) is set in our calculations at 425 ± 68 ppmv based on the late Changhsingian pCO 2 estimates calculated by Li et al. 16 using stomatal ratio method and mechanistic gas exchange model for fossil conifers from the Dalong Formation in South China, with good age control and reliable taxonomy.</p>
        <p>Our estimates (Fig. 3) show that pCO 2 was moderately low (426 +133/-96 ppmv) at 252.1 Ma within the pre-CIE stage (upper part of conodont Clarkina changxingensis zone). Subsequently, the pCO 2 began to increase rapidly in the Clarkina yini zone, reaching a maximum level (2507 +4764/-1193 ppmv), immediately after the Permian-Triassic boundary (Hindeodus parvus zone). This near six-fold increase of atmospheric pCO 2 occurred within ~75 kyr and coincided with the onset of the global CIE. The pCO 2 remained high (ca. 1500 to 2500 ppmv) immediately after the onset of the CIE, with only one transient drop (down to ca. 1300 ppmv). Coupled to the recovery of δ 13 C, pCO 2 drops to ca. 700 ppmv at the top of Isarcicella isarcica zone. Atmospheric CO 2 levels show a close coupling with estimated sea surface temperatures (r = + 0.60, p &lt; 0.001, n = 173; Supplementary Fig. 7), implying that CO 2 was likely the dominant greenhouse gas across the PTME, although the contribution of other greenhouse gases such as methane and water vapor cannot be excluded here. The six-fold increase of atmospheric pCO 2 , together with a 10 °C increase in sea surface temperatures estimated from low latitude conodont oxygen isotope (Fig. 3) implies Earth system sensitivity (ESS) of 3.9 °C per doubling of CO 2 if we assume ESS equals to ΔT/log 2 [pCO 2(peak) /pCO 2(background) ] 34 . This is consistent with a previous estimate of the Permian-Triassic ESS 35 and the IPCC equilibrium climate sensitivity range of 1.5 to 4.5 with a median of 3.0 36 , suggesting slow feedbacks operated in the geologic past. However, climate model simulations reveal that the increase of SST in high latitude should be higher than low latitude 37 . As a result, the 10 °C SST increase in low latitude might underestimate the global SST increase, which leads to an underestimate of the Earth system sensitivity during the PTME.</p>
        <p>Comparison with previous studies and uncertainty. Previous pCO 2 estimates around the Permian-Triassic boundary (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 2) come from stomatal proxies 16,17 , palaeosol carbonates 13,14 , phytane 15 and carbon cycle modelling (e.g. refs. [18][19][20] ). Published proxy-based pCO 2 reconstructions are mostly for the late Permian, within long-term and very lowresolution Phanerozoic records. Stomata-based estimates from modified fossil Ginkgo stomatal index method 17 gave pCO 2 around 400-800 ppmv in the latest Permian, but with poor age constraint and high taxonomic uncertainty 16 . Latest Permian pCO 2 from δ 13 C of palaeosol carbonates from Texas, US 13 , was calculated at 400 ppmv 38,39 (re-calculated by ref. 38 values (883-1325 ppmv). Similarly, the δ 13 C phytane -based pCO 2 estimates show that CO 2 levels during Changhsingian could have ranged from 873 to 1085 ppmv 15 . The few earliest Triassic peak pCO 2 estimates from stomatal 17 and phytane 15 proxies show significant variation (600-2100 ppmv). Simulations with various climate models (e.g. carbon cycle box modelling 18,19 and cGENIE 20 ) show major variability of peak pCO 2 values (1000-9380 ppmv; Supplementary Table 3), using a large range of assumed background pCO 2 . Several effects, especially diagenesis 40 , chemical treatment 41 , plant taxonomic changes 42 and precipitation 43,44 can influence the δ 13 C p and consequently affect pCO 2 estimates. The original signals of δ 13 C p values can potentially be altered by diagenesis during burial 40 and chemical treatment during sample preparation 41 . However, the method we use to calculate palaeo-pCO 2 considers a relative change of the Δ 13 C that minimizes these biases (Methods). A dramatic plants turnover occurred in southwestern China during the PTME, with a Gigantopteris flora (spore plant) in the Xuanwei and basal Kayitou formations replaced by an Tomiostrobus (spore plant) and Peltaspermum (seed plant) dominated flora 45 . Experiments on modern plants indicate lower Δ 13 C in seed plants than in spore plants 42 . Using a plant assemblage including a mixture of different taxa and plant tissues is better than using single species and plant remains when using δ 13 C p as pCO 2 proxy 33 . In this study we used a mixture of different plant tissues (i.e. cuticle, charred wood and non-charred wood), which very likely includes different plant taxa.</p>
        <p>An increase of the mean annual precipitation (MAP) can also increase Δ 13 C 44,46 . This effect is negligible in sites experiencing high precipitation (&gt;1500 mm/yr) 47 , such as the studied area in southwestern China, which was a humid, equatorial peatland during the PTME 45 . The plant community changed from Gigantopteris flora-dominated rainforest ecosystem to isoetaleandominated (lycophyte) herbaceous vegetation that inhabited the surrounding margins of coastal oligotrophic lakes, which indicate fairly constant precipitation regimes during the PTME interval 48,49 . The sedimentology of the Xuanwei and Kayitou formations suggests there was no significant precipitation change across the mass extinction (Supplementary Fig. 8; ref. 50 ). In contrast, low MAP can explain the smaller magnitude of the CIE (&lt;3%) recorded at the PTME in the semi-arid locations of Karoo Basin and North China 31 . In summary, the persistently humid condition in southwestern China was unlikely to have affected plant Δ 13 C, thus the pCO 2 estimates are considered robust. A Monte Carlo method has been applied to evaluate the uncertainties (Supplementary Information; Supplementary Fig. 9), which reveals that the uncertainty in the pCO 2 increases with increasing pCO 2 , as seen in the previous studies 51 .</p>
        <p>Potential source of 13 C-depleted carbon during the PTME. The ultimate source of 13 C-depleted carbon capable to trigger the observed negative CIE, is widely debated. Several climate models of varying complexities (e.g. simple box models 18,19 and cGENIE 20 ) use different light carbon sources to fit the δ 13 C of marine carbonates (Supplementary Table 3). Proposed 13 C-depleted carbon sources include biotic or thermogenic methane (δ 13 C ≈ -60% to -40%; e.g. ref. 18 ), CO 2 from thermal metamorphism or rapid oxidation of organic-rich rock (δ 13 C ≈ -25%; e.g. ref. 6,19,52,53 ), and Conodont zones are those of the Meishan section. Global marine carbonate carbon isotope (δ 13 C carb ) compiled from ten sections (Methods). Land C 3 plant carbon isotopes profile (δ 13 C p ) is from the four study sections in southwestern China (Fig. 1). Sea surface temperature (SST) was calculated based on conodont δ 18 O values from South China (Meishan and Shangsi) [1][2][3] , Iran (Kuh-e-Ali Bashi and Zal) 4 and Armenia (Chanakchi) 5 . The blue, green and red lines represent the LOESS fit curve for δ 13 C carb , δ 13 C p and SST, respectively, while light blue, green, and red shaded area represent 68% confidence intervals (standard errors calculated from LOESS). Reconstruction of atmospheric pCO 2 based on carbon isotope fractionation in C 3 land plant (on a log scale). Median values of the 10,000 re-samplings determined by Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation are shown as dark gray line. The 68% confidence intervals for pCO 2 are showed as light gray shaded area (lower limit and upper limit represent the 16 th and 84 th percentiles respectively). Previous reported pCO 2 estimates based on stomata 16,17 , palaeosol carbonates 13,14 and phytane 15 are shown as points with error bar (Supplementary Table 2). Marine species richness data show the two pulse mass extinction 8 volcanic CO 2 (δ 13 C ≈ -6%; e.g. ref. 54 ) or a combination of these sources 20 . We performed a simple carbon isotope mass balance to evaluate the most likely 13 C-depleted carbon source 55,56 . Under the assumption of four possible 13 C-depleted carbon sources (i.e. volcanic CO 2 , organic matter, thermogenic methane, and biogenic methane), the mass of released carbon was calculated (Fig. 4) and compared with our pCO 2 rise estimates (2081 +4764/-1193 ppmv). Our calculated pCO 2 mostly falls within the range of model results for organic matter and methane release scenarios (Fig. 4), supporting the hypothesis that these more 13 C-depleted sources than volcanic CO 2 are required to contribute to the global carbon cycle perturbation. There are some U-Pb dating 7 and field evidence 6,57 show that the organic-rich sediment intruded by Siberian Traps sill likely provided massive 13 C-depleted CO 2 and thermogenic methane, which may have been the ultimate trigger of the global CIE and significant increase in atmospheric CO 2 . However, due to the limitation of the C 3 plant proxy, the uncertainty of pCO 2 is significantly larger at high CO 2 levels (Supplementary Fig. 9). Therefore, volcanic CO 2 source could still have made a contribution to the global carbon cycle perturbation. The best estimates for mass of added carbon based on a 3.5% carbonate CIE magnitude and a source with δ 13 C of -25% to -60%, suggest that at least 3900~12,000 Gt carbon were added into the ocean-atmosphere system during the PTME. Previous estimates (15,000-20,000 Gt C) were based on an assumed ca. 5.5% negative shift of C 3 plant in simple mass balance calculations 32 and might therefore have overstated the amount of added carbon. The ca. 7% CIE in C 3 plants, amplified by pCO 2 increase, also produces an over-estimate in the mass balance calculation (Fig. 4). Our estimates of the amount of injected carbon are also smaller than those calculated by the cGENIE climate model (7,000~22,400 Gt C) 20 , because the ~5% magnitude of δ 13 C carb from Meishan used in the calculations is too large compared to the global carbonate records. However, simple mass balance calculations don't consider global carbon cycle fundamental processes and changes through time, like carbon weathering and burial rates during the studied interval. In addition, the size of the DIC reservoir is usually assumed to be the size of the background surface carbon reservoir, because of poor understanding of atmosphere carbon reservoir size 58 . These limitations might lead to an underestimate of the total mass of added CO 2 .</p>
        <p>Carbon emission caused prolonged high pCO 2 and high temperature (ca. 35 °C) during the earliest Triassic (H. parvus and I. isarcica zones) and may have lasted for &gt; 500 kyr (Fig. 3). This lengthy phase of extreme warmth likely implies prolonged carbon emissions into ocean-atmosphere system from continued eruption of the Siberian Traps volcanism, and/or reduced carbon sequestration rate, potentially due to lower consumption of atmospheric CO 2 through reduced organic carbon burial and the possible failure of the silicate weathering thermostat 59 .</p>
        <p>Sample treatment and analysis. In total, 68 samples from Chinahe, 41 samples from ZK4703 and 40 samples from Jiucaichong were analyzed for bulk organic carbon isotopes. Samples were crushed to fine powder (&lt;200 mesh), and ∼2 g powder were weighed, placed into a centrifuge tube and treated with 3 mol/L HCl for 24 h to remove the carbonate. Then the treated samples were rinsed with ultrapure water repeatedly until neutralized and finally dried at 35 °C. For C 3 plants δ 13 C analysis, 45 samples from Chinahe, 26 samples from ZK4703, 30 samples from Jiucaichong and 13 samples from Chahe were treated with concentrated HCl and HF, then sieved over 500 μm and a 100 μm mesh screen to get the 100~500 μm particles. C 3 plant fragments, including cuticle, non-charred wood and charred wood (charcoal), were picked under the microscope. The δ 13 C org analyses were performed by using an elemental analyzer (EA) coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Thermo Delta V Advantage) at the State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology of the China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). The results were calibrated using certified secondary references standards: USGS40 (δ 13 C = -26.39%) and UREA (δ 13 C = -37.32%) and given in per mil (%) relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) with analytical precision better than ± 0.2%. A Multi EA 4000-analyzer was used for TOC at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), yielding an analytical precision of 1.5%.</p>
        <p>Carbon isotope compilation and estimate of CIE magnitude. In order to estimate a reliable magnitude of the CIE, the carbon isotope profiles that record a roughly complete CIE shape with pre-CIE and CIE body are selected in our study. The compilation consists of 69 marine carbonate carbon isotope (δ 13 C carb ) profiles and 38 terrestrial δ 13 C org profiles. The δ 13 C carb profiles recording complete negative CIE are from Eastern Palaeotethys (n = 29), Western Palaeotethys (n = 19), Central Palaeotethys (n = 4), Northern Neotethys (n = 4), Southern Neotethys (n = 10) and Panthalassa (n = 3). Bulk marine organic matter δ 13 C records were not included, because they often represent a mix of various organic components (both marine and terrestrial). The sedimentary facies belong to a range of shallow shelf, deep shelf, and slope environments. The few reported δ 13 C carb profiles from deep basins are ignored in this compilation (e.g. Shangsi section), because the elevated water stratification and large vertical δ 13 C DIC gradients at deep basin sites during Permian-Triassic crisis could cause large CIE magnitudes 60 . A total of 38 terrestrial δ 13 C org records are reviewed from eight terrestrial basins including western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan in southwestern China (n = 14), Junggar Basin (n = 3), Turpan Basin (n = 1), North China (n = 3), Central European Basin (n = 1), Bowen Basin (n = 2), Sydney Basin (n = 7), Karoo Basin (n = 1) and three oceanic regions where organic matter (OM) in samples are C 3 plants or a mix of organic matter dominated by C 3 plants including South China (n = 1), Boreal realm (n = 2) and South Neotethys (n = 3). Among these terrestrial δ 13 C org profiles, there are nine records of δ 13 C records from C 3 plant (5 δ 13 C wood and 4 δ 13 C cuticle ) from Meishan section, Amb section in South Neotethys, southwestern China, and others are all bulk δ 13 C org profiles.</p>
        <p>In order to demonstrate the difference of marine and terrestrial CIE magnitudes, carbon isotope values immediately before the CIE (δ 13 C background ) and peak values (δ 13 C peak ) are used to calculate the magnitude of the CIE (δ 13 C peakδ 13 C background ). Note that 31 pairs of δ 13 C background and δ 13 C peak values are from marine sections that are well constrained by latest Permian conodont occurrences (e.g. C. changxingensis, H. praeparvus, H. latidentatus zones) and earliest Triassic conodont (H. parvus and I. isarcica zones) occurrences. To test if the discrepancy of the CIE magnitude in different substrates (marine carbonate, terrestrial bulk OM, terrestrial C 3 plant tissues) is statistically significant, we used a non-parameter Kruskal-Wallis test (function kruskal.test), using 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> software. The Wilcoxon (function wilcox.test) test was performed in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> software to determine whether means of two independent groups (marine vs. terrestrial) are equal or not. Boxplots were drawn to visualize discrepancy in CIE magnitude of different substrates. All statistical analyses and graphing functions were undertaken using 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>.

        <p>C 3 plant proxy. The carbon isotope fractionation in C 3 plants (Δ 13 C) and atmospheric pCO 2 is described as a hyperbolic relationship [22][23][24]61 : Organic matter (-25‰) Thermogenic methane (-40‰) Biogenic methane (-60‰)</p>
        <p>Fig. 4 Mass of added carbon estimated from carbon isotope mass balance calculation. Four different scenarios including volcanic CO 2 (δ 13 C = -6%), organic matter (δ 13 C = -25%), thermogenic methane (δ 13 C = -40%) and biogenic methane hydrate (δ 13 C = -60%). Second y-axis converts the mass of added carbon to an increase in atmospheric pCO 2 based on the earth system model (1 Gt C = 0.3 ppmv CO 2 ) 55,56 . Gray shaded area represents the 68% confidence intervals of pCO 2 increase (2081 +4764/-1193 ppmv) estimated from the C 3 plant proxy.</p>
        <p>The original δ 13 C signals in C 3 plant can be altered by several effects (e.g. diagenesis 40 , chemical treatments 41 ), that potentially influence pCO 2 calculations. In order to minimize this effect, the data set is analyzed by a relative change in the Δ 13 C value between the time of interest (t) and a reference time (t = 0), designated as Δ (Δ 13 C):</p>
        <p>which can be expanded as:</p>
        <p>By rearranging Eq. ( 3), pCO</p>
        <p>where δ 13 C pðt¼0Þ and δ 13 C p(t) are δ 13 C values in C 3 plant at reference time (t = 0) and the time of interest (t). The values for δ 13 C pðt¼0Þ is determined as -24.42 ± 0.5%, whose age equals to Clarkina changxingensis conodont zone that occurred slightly earlier than the onset of the CIE 16 . We suggest that a mixture of δ 13 C in C 3 plant cuticle, charred wood and non-charred wood from southwestern China (without δ 13 C of bulk OM) provides the best choice as δ 13 C p(t) input data for three reasons. Firstly, using the δ 13 C values of C 3 plant tissues (e.g. cuticle, wood) can minimize the influence of varying OM sources from mixed soils and sediments. Several previous reports on terrestrial δ 13 C org in western Guizhou and eastern Yunnan, South China have recorded the negative CIE 27,28,62,63 , but all the data are not δ 13 C from C 3 plants and not suitable for pCO 2 calculation. Secondly, Eq. ( 1) is based on the combination of carbon isotope from stem and leaf tissues of chamber plants. Thirdly, the mixture of different micro plant tissues (i.e. cuticle, charred wood and non-charred wood) would contain different plant fossils species that is suggested to be better than a single species approach when applying this proxy 33 . The δ 13 C CO 2 ðt¼0Þ and δ 13 C CO 2 ðtÞ are δ 13 C values in atmospheric CO 2 at reference time (t = 0) and the time of interest (t). The temperature (T) dependent carbon isotope fractionation between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and atmospheric CO 2 64 can be used to calculate δ 13 C CO 2 .</p>
        <p>where T is the sea surface temperature determined from oxygen isotopes of conodont fossils [1][2][3][4][5] . δ 13 C DIC can be estimated from marine δ 13 C carb (δ 13 C DIC = δ 13 C carb -1%), because the carbon isotope fractionation between marine carbonate (δ 13 C carb ) and dissolved inorganic carbon (δ 13 C DIC ) is constant and independent of temperature (~1%) 65 . Among the global CIE compilations, 10 marine, high-resolution, nonbasinal δ 13 C carb profiles are well constrained by detail conodont zones including Meishan 30 , Nhi Tao 66 , Yangou 67 in eastern Palaeotethys; Zal 3 , Kuh-e-Ali Bashi 3 in central Palaeotethys; Bálvány North 68 in western Paloetethys; Shahreza 12 , Abadeh 12 in northern Neotethys; Wadi Shahha 69 , Wenbudangsang 70 in Southern Neotethys. Thus, we integrated these 10 δ 13 C carb profiles together as a global marine δ 13 C carb profile combined with a U-Pb age model 30 and high-resolution conodont zones (conodont zones from Meishan are selected as standard 71,72 ). LOESS curves with 0.002 Myr spacing were fitted to the integration of global marine δ 13 C carb . At each 0.002 Myr time step, the probability maximum value and standard error are identified and served as δ 13 C carb input parameters in calculations. The best degree of smoothing for LOESS fitting was determined using cross-validation method in package 
            <rs type="software">fANCOVA</rs>. To eliminate the potential for an uneven distribution of δ 13 C carb data, we also applied a LOESS fitting based on an 80% subsample of all data. In addition, the δ 13 C carb data from Meishan (n = 199) is the most abundant of all the δ 13 C carb data (n = 707), thus, we performed a LOESS fitting based on δ 13 C carb data without Meishan data (Supplementary Fig. 4).

        <p>In order to calculate pCO 2(t) , we need to align global marine δ 13 C carb profiles and δ 13 C p based on same age model. The nearly same CIE curves were divided into four stages in carbonate and C 3 plants records to ensure the correlation between marine and terrestrial carbon isotope profiles. The age model for four sections is showed in Supplementary Information. In addition, the LOESS method with 0.002 Myr spacing was also performed in δ 13 C p and temperature data to get the probability maximum value and standard error at each 0.002 Myr time step. The Monte Carlo method was employed to propagate input error 51 by the propagate package in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>. All the input parameters were assumed to be Gaussian distributed with mean and standard deviations listed in Supplementary Table 4. 10,000 values for each input parameters were randomly sampled to calculate 10,000 values for each pCO 2(t) . The invalid pCO 2(t) values (i.e., pCO 2(t) &lt; 0 or &gt;10 6 ppmv) were excluded. The 16 th and 84 th percentiles of the remaining estimates were determined to construct the 68% confidence interval. The positive error of the reconstructed pCO 2(t) value represents the difference between the 84th percentile value and the median, and the negative error represents the difference between the 16th percentile value and the median. The sensitivity analysis of C 3 plant proxy is discussed in Supplementary information and Supplementary Fig. 9.

        <p>Carbon isotope mass balance. This model used to evaluate the light carbon source, following mass balance equation is modified from McInerney and Wing 55 :</p>
        <p>where M added is the mass of carbon added into atmosphere-ocean system carbon emission. The M background represents initial carbon reservoir size during Permian-Triassic including ocean and atmosphere carbon inventory, but dominated by the ocean reservoir. Thus, the M background is assumed to be the initial marine DIC reservoir size ranging from 66,000 to 82,000 Gt 58,73 . CIE represents the global magnitude of CIE controlled only by release of light carbon effect, which is set as a series values from -1% to -8%. The peak δ 13 C value (δ 13 C peak ) at the event is calculated by initial isotopic composition of global carbon reservoir (δ 13 C background ) and CIE (δ 13 C peak = δ 13 C background + CIE). The δ 13 C background is assumed to be the initial isotopic composition of DIC reservoir 2.2% that is estimated from global marine δ 13 C carb profiles (age &gt;252.104 Ma). The δ 13 C added is the δ 13 C value of the carbon source causing the CIE. Four kinds of carbon sources are involved including biogenic methane buried in permafrost or seafloor (δ 13 C = -60%), thermogenic methane (δ 13 C = -40%), thermal metamorphism or rapid oxidation of organic-rich rock (δ 13 C = -25%) and CO 2 released from direct volcanic eruption (-6%). Finally, the increased pCO 2 is estimated from M added (1 Gt C = 0.3 ppmv; ref. 56 ), and compared with reconstructed atmospheric CO 2 levels from C 3 plant proxy.</p>

        <p>Boxplot of carbon isotope excursion magnitudes for three substrates. Carbon isotope excursion (CIE) magnitudes of marine carbonate, terrestrial bulk organic matter (OM), and terrestrial C 3 plant compiled from the literature and this study. The magnitude of the terrestrial CIE is larger compared to the marine CIE magnitude. The Wilcoxon test suggests that the CIE magnitude between marine and terrestrial substrate is statistically different (Supplementary Table</p>
