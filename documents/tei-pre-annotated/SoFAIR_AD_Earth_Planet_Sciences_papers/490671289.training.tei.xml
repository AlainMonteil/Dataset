        <p>Constructing multi-source satellite-derived water quality (WQ) products in inland and nearshore coastal waters from the past, present, and future missions is a long-standing challenge. Despite inherent differences in sensors' spectral capability, spatial sampling, and radiometric performance, research efforts focused on formulating, implementing, and validating universal WQ algorithms continue to evolve. This research extends a recently developed machine-learning (ML) model, i.e., Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Pahlevan et al., 2020;Smith et al., 2021), to the inverse problem of simultaneously retrieving WQ indicators, including chlorophyll-a (Chla), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and the absorption by Colored Dissolved Organic Matter at 440 nm (a cdom (440)), across a wide array of aquatic ecosystems. We use a database of in situ measurements to train and optimize MDN models developed for the relevant spectral measurements (400-800 nm) of the Operational Land Imager (OLI), MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions, respectively. Our two performance assessment approaches, namely hold-out and leaveone-out, suggest significant, albeit varying degrees of improvements with respect to second-best algorithms, depending on the sensor and WQ indicator (e.g., 68%, 75%, 117% improvements based on the hold-out method for Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440), respectively from MSI-like spectra). Using these two assessment methods, we provide theoretical upper and lower bounds on model performance when evaluating similar and/or out-ofsample datasets. To evaluate multi-mission product consistency across broad spatial scales, map products are demonstrated for three near-concurrent OLI, MSI, and OLCI acquisitions. Overall, estimated TSS and a cdom (440) from these three missions are consistent within the uncertainty of the model, but Chla maps from MSI and OLCI</p>
        <p>With the availability of free satellite images from multiple missions capable of making high fidelity radiometric measurements over water bodies, devising proper processing chains to produce harmonized global water quality (WQ) products is currently a high-priority research topic. Global WQ products are critical for addressing the pressing questions surrounding aquatic ecosystems threatened by a changing climate and ever-increasing human exploitation of natural resources. These challenges primarily pertain to aquatic ecosystem responses to shifts in climate and human activities and the disentanglement of the impacts of these two main drivers (e.g., wildfire (Kramer et al., 2020) or extended dry/wet periods (Mosley, 2015) versus landuse and landcover change (Baker, 2006)) across different eco-hydrodynamic regions. Landcover and landuse change, deforestation and reforestation (Mapulanga and Naito, 2019), or mining activities (Dethier et al., 2019;Lobo et al., 2015), for example, can alter the regional carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems, thereby affecting aquatic life and water quality (Kutser et al., 2005). Further, operational utilities and water resource management agencies increasingly tend to rely on satellite assets for improved sampling schemes and informed decision-making (Binding et al., 2021;Schaeffer et al., 2018). At large spatial scales with seasonal variability, it is consequential for these end-users to access reliable satellite-derived WQ indicators applicable to a broad range of aquatic ecosystem conditions (e.g., various trophic states).</p>
        <p>The optical WQ indicators considered in this study include chlorophyll-a (Chla), total suspended solids (TSS), and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), measured as CDOM absorption at 440 nm (a cdom (440)). These indicators, together with water and other non-water Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs), regulate the color of the water (Gordon et al., 1975), which is commonly quantified as water-leaving radiance (L w (λ) ; W m -2 sr -1 nm -1 ) just above the water (Mobley, 1994). Because L w (λ) varies according to the illumination conditions, it is commonly normalized by the total downwelling irradiance and expressed as spectral remote sensing reflectance, i.e., R rs (λ), in units of sr -1 (Mobley, 1999). For conciseness, the spectral dependency is dropped hereafter.</p>
        <p>Among the three WQ indicators targeted here, Chla, the primary pigment found in all phytoplankton types, is a proxy for phytoplankton biomass whose shortage or excess leads to detrimental consequences on ecosystem function, health, and integrity. While phytoplankton absorb and scatter incoming solar irradiance, in open-ocean environments, it is the absorption by Chla, with two major absorbing peaks at 443 and 670 nm, that primarily regulates the shape of R rs in the visible spectrum (Kiefer and Mitchell, 1983). R rs is further modulated by the absorption by other pigments, such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins (Sathyendranath et al., 1989), leading to peaks and troughs throughout the visible spectrum (Bricaud et al., 1998). In optically complex waters, these spectral features are generally masked by the absorption and/or scattering induced by suspended particles as well as by a cdom . Across global aquatic ecosystems, TSS, inclusive of all organic and inorganic suspended particles, influences turbidity. Its elevated quantities may limit the availability of light to benthic habitats, trap heat in the upper layers of the water column, thereby triggering harmful algal blooms (HABs) (Bukata et al., 1995). They can be associated with the transport of polluting substances including heavy metals and nutrients to waterways (Snyder and Carson, 1986). Its contribution to R rs is through the absorption and scattering regimes and, in general, governs the overall magnitude of R rs (Novo et al., 1989). CDOM may be considered as a proxy for dissolved organic carbon (Hestir et al., 2015;Kutser et al., 2015;Spencer et al., 2012), enabling regional and/or global assessments of the carbon budget and cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Duarte and Prairie, 2005;Roehm et al., 2009). Due to its lightabsorbing characteristics, particularly in the ultraviolet (UV) and blue spectrum, an increase in CDOM concentration restricts light availability in the water column, hence aquatic life (Roulet and Moore, 2006). In coastal estuaries, a cdom is regarded as a proxy for salinity, an important variable that mediates coastal biodiversity (Benlloch et al., 2002) and plays a major role in identifying aquaculture sites (Resley et al., 2006). Global quantification of changes in these optical WQ indicators over time can elucidate aquatic ecosystem responses to environmental stressors and inform the global environmental policy (Hakimdavar et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Global assessment of these indicators using field sampling techniques alone is not feasible. Despite decades of research and developments (Brezonik et al., 2015;Bukata et al., 1995;Gitelson, 1992;Odermatt et al., 2012), the potential of remote sensing for many aquatic ecosystems has not been fully realized, leaving behind a significant portion of global satellite observations Further, methods for generating reliable global products still deserve thorough studies. The objective of this research is to extend a previously developed machine-learning (ML) model, i.e., Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Pahlevan et al., 2020;Smith et al., 2021) to concurrently estimate Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440) from the Operational Land Imager (OLI), MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions, respectively. To the extent possible (owing to the differences in the spectral, spatial, and radiometric characteristics of these instruments), we aim to advance consistency among multi-mission products to deliver globally seamless WQ products. This development relies on an in situ database that contains hyperspectral radiometric measurements and co-located Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440). The model performance is gauged against that of select, topperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. The model is then retrained using all the available in situ data for application to OLI, MSI, and OLCI images and assessment of WQ matchups.</p>
        <p>Optically relevant WQ indicators and inherent and apparent optical properties (IOPs, AOPs) have been collected over four decades using radiometers aboard vessels, airborne platforms, or satellites. This has generated considerable advances in our ability to estimate Chla (Gitelson et al., 2007;Gower et al., 2005;Moses et al., 2012a;O'Reilly et al., 1998), TSS (Doxaran et al., 2002;Knaeps et al., 2015;Petus et al., 2010), or a cdom (Kowalczuk et al., 2003;Nieke et al., 1997). Recent and upcoming launches of satellite missions continuously improve spatiotemporal coverage of aquatic environments and produce higher quality radiometric measurements. This has spurred the development of new high-quality WQ products (Balasubramanian et al., 2020;Cao and Tzortziou, 2021;Jiang et al., 2021;Smith et al., 2021) and algorithms that operate across different sensors (Pahlevan et al., 2020). Concurrently with enhancements in satellite data, the body of high-quality in situ radiometric and biogeochemical data has increased (Spyrakos et al., 2018), offering more realistic representations of natural waters in comparison to synthetic data that has long served as the backbone of similar efforts in the ocean color domain (IOCCG, 2006).</p>
        <p>Similar to other geophysical problems, estimating Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440) from multispectral R rs is by definition an inverse problem, where a function of form f -1 is sought to predict a vector x given R rs , i.e., x[Chla, TSS, a cdom (440)] = f -1 (R rs ). Note that here we assume IOP components are not measured or unavailable. Given the inherent covariations and nonlinearities of IOPs and the associated substance concentrations in global inland and coastal waters (Bukata et al., 1995;Doerffer and Fischer, 1994;IOCCG, 2000IOCCG, , 2006IOCCG, , 2018;;Mobley, 1994;Zheng et al., 2015), a simultaneous retrieval scheme may exploit the fact that various natural combinations of these variables differently drive the magnitude and shape of R rs . For optically complex waters, such schemes fall into three families of algorithms: a) Linear Matrix Inversion (LMI) (Brando and Dekker, 2003;Giardino et al., 2007;Hoogenboom et al., 1998), b) spectral matching based on look-up-tables (Arabi et al., 2020;Concha and Schott, 2016;Gerace et al., 2013;Raqueno, 2003), and c) machine-learning models (Doerffer and Schiller, 2007;Hieronymi et al., 2017;Keiner and Yan, 1998;Tanaka et al., 2004). All these approaches have shown promise for estimating WQ indicators and, in some cases, for IOPs in inland and nearshore coastal waters; however, most developed models have been evaluated at local or regional scales only, due to the lack of globally representative development data (e.g., the absence of specific IOPs in case of LMI). Among these methods, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network (Doerffer and Schiller, 2007) trained with a Hydrolight simulated dataset (Mobley and Sundman, 2008) has been adopted as the standard processing of OLCI data over inland waters (Toming et al., 2017) and applied to OLI (Hafeez et al., 2019) and MSI (Ansper and Alikas, 2019;Brockmann et al., 2016;Soomets et al., 2020). Instead of using simulated data, our study leverages a sizable database of in situ data for training and testing of an MDN for the simultanous estimation of Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440) at a global scale.</p>
        <p>A large portion of our database (R rs -Chla and R rs -TSS) has been described in previous publications (Balasubramanian et al., 2020;Jiang et al., 2021;Pahlevan et al., 2020;Smith et al., 2021). For this study, we added new co-located samples from Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Spain, Uruguay, and Brazil (Fig. 1). This dataset has been further augmented by in situ R rs -a cdom (440) measurements. Our most complete dataset includes paired R rs and Chla samples that correspond to 35 different sources, each encompassing data from one or multiple campaigns from a single principal investigator (PI). Our TSS and a cdom (440) datasets came from 26 and 17 sources, respectively. The details on the geographic scope of these sources are provided in Appendix A. Note that the data from a single PI delivered at different stages were treated as separate sources, leading to a total of 42 different sources (Appendix A).</p>
        <p>The frequency distributions of each WQ component and their respective correlations are shown in Fig. 2. It is these covariances that our algorithm uses to determine the inverse function and produce the three indicators (Section 4). For our development, the measured hyperspectral R rs were resampled with the four, seven, and 12 Relative Spectral Responses (RSRs) of OLI, MSI, and OLCI within the 410-800 nm spectral range, respectively (see Appendix B for more details). The spectral coverage of our R rs spectra fell into two categories; the ones covering 400-700 nm and those that had extended coverage from 400 through 800 nm. For this reason, the number of samples for the spectral band configurations of the sensors differed. OLCI's band centered near 400 nm was not considered here due to the small number of in situ spectra encompassing the UV range.</p>
        <p>To demonstrate the quality of our WQ map products, three instances of near-simultaneous images acquired by OLI, MSI, and OLCI over two major estuaries and one hypereutrophic lake (Section 5.2) were</p>

The percentage of contributed data from each continent is also provided for the data applicable to MSI (see text). Note that 63 samples from South Africa have not been illustrated (see Table A).</p>
        <p>processed via the Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite' (ACOLITE) (Vanhellemont and Ruddick, 2021). These scenarios were selected because they represent a wide range of WQ conditions (e.g., 0.5 &lt; Chla &lt; 100 mg m -3 ). While no ideal atmospheric correction (AC) processor for generating seamless R rs from these missions has yet become available (Pahlevan et al., 2021a;Warren et al., 2019), ACOLITE (v20190326.0) is a convenient processor for inland and nearshore coastal waters and allows for retrieving R rs under highly turbid or eutrophic optical regimes, thereby making it a suitable choice for demonstration purposes.</p>
        <p>To understand how uncertainties in both Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) observations and AC processing manifest in derived R rs , i.e., uncertainties in R rs -hereafter referred to as σ(R rs ), and subsequent MDN products, OLI and MSI images at WQ matchup locations were reduced to R rs via two AC processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (
            <rs type="software">SeaDAS</rs> v
            <rs type="version">7.5.3</rs>) and ACOLITE. Per Pahlevan et al. (2021a), these two processors perform relatively well in nearshore coastal and inland waters, respectively. For SeaDAS, the Near-InfraRed (NIR) and ShortWave InfraRed (SWIR) band combinations were utilized to account for aerosol contribution, whereas ACOLITE was used with its default setting (dark spectrum fitting). Because of MSI's low signal-to-noise ratio in the NIR and SWIR bands (Pahlevan et al., 2017a), 
            <rs type="software">SeaDAS</rs> did not return as many matchups as ACOLITE when MSI imagery were processed. This issue however does not apply to OLI (Pahlevan et al., 2021a). Here, median satellite-derived WQ estimates within 3 × 3-element windows were computed.
        </p>
        <p>In situ WQ data for this matchup exercise were obtained from various databases across North America. A majority of the Chla matchup dataset has been employed in previous studies (Pahlevan et al., 2021a;(Smith et al., 2021) ). This study added TSS and a cdom (440) matchups. The TSS data were mostly available through the U.S. Water Quality Portal (htt ps://www.waterqualitydata.us) and Geological Survey's National Water Information System (https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) that contain data from small inland waters, as well as through the Chesapeake Bay repository (https://www.chesapeakebay.net) with data mostly ranging from 0.1 to 20 g m -3 . These datasets were further augmented by the repository provided in Ross et al. (2019). Several filtering techniques were executed to exclude duplicate data records. More Chla and a cdom (440) data were made available through the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada's (NERC) Lake Pulse Network (LPN), an extensive multi-year field campaign conducted across select drinking water supplies and lakes in Canada (Huot et al., 2019). Additional a cdom (440) datasets acquired in Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) and across several lakes in Minnesota were contributed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and the University of Minnesota (Olmanson et al., 2020), respectively. For Chla and TSS matchups, we permitted a +/-3 h time window from the satellite overpass for coastal matchups and a same-day overpass for inland waters. Given the known stability of a cdom (440) over extended periods at our matchup sites, i.e., boreal lakes (Cardille et al., 2013), and to incorporate an adequate number of matchups, we adopted a +/-3 Fig. 2. Frequency distribution (top) of WQ indicators for which co-located R rs spectra covering the MSI visible-Near-InfraRed spectral bands (&lt; 800 nm) were available. 2D histograms (bottom) exhibit correlations between co-located sample pairs. The number of available data samples was the highest for OLI (410 &lt; λ &lt; 700 nm) and slightly lower for OLCI due to a broader spectral coverage. The R-squared (R 2 ) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) are annotated to give insights into the correlations between WQ indicators. day time window for this parameter (Brezonik et al., 2015). Note that a large portion of our dataset originates from narrow ecosystems or nearshore coastal waters making it difficult to obtain enough matchups for OLCI's 300 m nominal spatial resolution.</p>
        <p>MDNs differ from traditional neural networks (Bishop, 1995;Bricaud et al., 2007;Jamet et al., 2012) in that they produce the likelihoods of generated estimates (Bishop, 1994). Succinctly, MDNs learn a probability distribution over the output space, thereby accomodating multimodal target distributions. This multimodality is a fundamental characteristic of inverse problems, where a non-unique relationship exists between input and output features. Using the probabilities estimated for each individual prediction, users may choose the maximum likelihood estimate (the prediction with the highest probability) or the weighted average of all predictions (e.g., see five likelihood functions in Fig. 3). Similar to previous publications, the model input and output features encompass in situ R rs and in situ WQ indicators (Section 3.1), respectively. Adopted from Pahlevan et al. (2020), an example for a Chla estimation from an arbitrary MSI-like R rs spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 3, with Gaussian mixtures output by the model and the maximum likelihood estimate representing the final prediction. For comparison, estimates from a conventional MLP (Smith et al., 2021) and the Ocean Color 3-band algorithm (OC3) (O'Reilly and Werdell, 2019) are also depicted. This multimodal representation within the target space allows for enhanced predictions compared to other ML models. Traditional ML models like MLPs or other empirical Chla models report a single estimate without insights into the distribution of estimates.</p>
        <p>Further, Smith et al. (2021) have shown that for a Chla retrieval task from OLI observations, MDNs outperform traditional MLPs by 20 to 30%, an improvement attributable to MDNs' ability in learning conditional probabilities. MDNs inherently learn the covariances among the output features, intuitively improving the accuracy over models intended for retrieving an individual parameter (Bishop, 1994). In general, multi-parameter inversion algorithms for biogeochemical properties and/or IOPs (e.g., Kallio et al. (2001)) are anticipated to constrain the solution space given the covariances among parameters of interest in a natural environment (Fig. 2). This study leverages this characteristic to estimate optically relevant WQ indicators through MDNs.</p>
        <p>For generating simultaneous WQ indicators, several modifications were made to the basic MDN model. First, the data itself necessitates special handling, due to hundreds of missing samples from one or two categories (Fig. 2). For instance, within the in situ Chla dataset suitable for OLI, there are 5680 available measurements out of a total of 6475 samples. For TSS and a cdom (440), the number of available measurements is even smaller (3847 and 2910 samples, respectively), with only 1613 samples encompassing all three quantities -just over 20% of the total dataset. To make use of the remaining 80% of the data with missing values, a method is needed to allow the MDN model to learn from partial information.</p>
        <p>To fill in the missing values, we apply a method referred to as multiple imputation (Rubin, 2004), which has been utilized in inverse problems related to geophysical parameter retrievals (Hudak et al., 2008;Junninen et al., 2004;Kalteh and Hjorth, 2009). Simply put, the missing values are replaced by values randomly drawn from a distribution that represents the dataset. After m values are drawn, each of those values is independently used to complete the analysis as if the value were not missing and subsequently pooled into a final analysis output. This process assumes the missing values are either Missing Completely At Random (MCAR), or as a slightly weaker assumption, Missing At Random (MAR) (King et al., 2001). Concretely, this means that we are assuming a missing Chla is not dependent upon the Chla value itself -it is, at worst, dependent only on the other available measurements for that sample. Suppose the missing value is instead conditionally missing upon its value (or the value of other missing variables). In that case, the data is considered Missing Not At Random (MNAR) and requires additional care in handling (King et al., 2001).</p>
        <p>MDNs inherently model the joint probability of all output variables, leading to a multiple imputation approach which is capable of handling even MNAR variables in certain circumstances (in addition to the usual MAR or MCAR) by allowing us to draw directly from the learned posterior (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2010;Galimard et al., 2018). Moreover, the multiple imputation estimates are improved continuously during the training of the MDN, i.e., as the MDN learns to better model the target variables, the accuracy of the imputed samples improves, thus leading to further improvements in the target variable estimates. Separate parts of this type of chained bootstrap learning have been documented in the literature (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1995).</p>
        <p>Brief experiments were performed to gauge how much improvement might be gained through hyperparameter optimization of the model, utilizing Amazon Sagemaker's Bayesian Search method to quickly search through the large space. It was found that the added complexity did not justify the relatively minor gains in performance, however, which is in line with the results shown previously (Smith et al. 2021). Instead, we used the configuration outlined in antecedent work to create models for all performance assessments: five Gaussian mixtures (Fig. 3), defined by a network using five hidden layers with 100 nodes in each layer; a learning and L2 normalization rate of 0.001 (a regularization term with model weights squared); and a bagging ensemble of ten models, over which the median is taken. See previous publications (Smith et al. 2021;Pahlevan et al., 2020) for additional details on the</p>
        <p>Per previous literature (Balasubramanian et al., 2020;Pahlevan et al., 2021b;Pahlevan et al., 2020;), several robust single-parameter retrieval methods applicable to OLI, MSI, and OLCI with their original form and coefficients were considered (Table 1). While &gt;20 algorithms for Chla and TSS estimations were initially examined, only a few a cdom (440) models viable for a wide range of CDOM content were The two primary metrics used to gauge the accuracy of retrievals are the median symmetric accuracy and signed systematic percentage bias (Morley et al., 2018) referred to as uncertainty (ε) and Bias (β) throughout:</p>
        <p>where e and o stand for estimated and in situ observed WQ indicators, respectively, and MR is median ratio. These metrics are similar to those applied in Seegers et al. (2018) with slight modifications for enhanced interpretability and robustness. Previous studies (Smith et al. 2021) have shown that these median measures, along with the slope of linear regressions (Type I), and root mean squared logarithmic difference (RMSLD), are adequate, offering a comprehensive perspective for evaluating algorithms. Two different schemes for the performance assessment were adopted. The first method was the commonly used hold-out method that entails a random split of the entire dataset. Similar to our prior research (Pahlevan et al., 2021b), we chose a 50-50 random split to allow equal datasets for testing and training. This approach, however, may favorably impact the model performance as the test data may not be entirely independent of the training samples (e.g., data acquired in one lake through one or multiple field campaigns may be correlated). To overcome this drawback and provide a more realistic (or even pessimistic) view of the performance, our second assessment strategy was the leaveone-out (LOO) approach where the model is trained with all the data sources (Appendix A) except one against which its performance is evaluated. This process is iterated until each data source is utilized once as a test set. The ultimate performance for MDN and the rest of the benchmarking algorithms is reported as the median or weighted average of all the individual performances (N = 35 for Chla in Fig. 5). This approach would deduce the expected performance of the model when an out-of-sample (unseen) dataset is applied to the model. In general, these two approaches (hold-out and LOO) are anticipated to provide a practical range for algorithm uncertainties and elucidate how well the model can estimate optical WQ indicators in globally diverse aquatic ecosystems.</p>
        <p>Due to the necessity of training an MDN for each data source in the LOO scheme, we used the 
            <rs type="creator">Amazon</rs>
            <rs type="software">SageMaker Studio</rs> (
            <rs type="url">https://aws.am azon.com/sagemaker</rs>/) to train the models simultaneously. Thus, each data split was sent as a separate training job ten times, with a different random seed used to initialize network weights and training data shuffling for each of these ten trials. The results of the ten trials were then averaged, and the final performance for each data source is used in the overall LOO weighted performance assessment (Table 3). In total, this led to several hundred training jobs necessary for each sensor.
        </p>
        <p>The performance assessment for MDN and two other best-performing algorithms based on the hold-out method implemented to MSI resampled R rs spectra (Section 3.1) is presented in Fig. 4. The MDN model shows negligible biases and moderate uncertainties across the three WQ indicators. Among all the tested Chla and TSS algorithms, Blend (Smith et al., 2018) and SOLID (Balasubramanian et al., 2020) are the secondbest performing algorithms, respectively. Notably, the MDN model predicts TSS with virtually no bias. For a cdom (440), MDN outperforms the other two algorithms with nearly half ε and RMSLD. Further, uncertainties in MDN estimates of a cdom (440) are highly uniform across the dynamic range spanning three orders of magnitude, whereas Ficek and QAA-CDOM approximations are only optimal for a cdom (440) ~ 1 m -1 . Reported Slopes slightly less than unity suggest degraded performance at the two tails of data distributions (e.g., Chla &lt; 1 mg m -3 and Chla &gt; 100 mg m -3 ) which may be alleviated with a larger dataset or by augmenting the existing dataset to fill in the gaps further. The equivalent metrics for OLI-and OLCI-like spectra are shown in Table 2. While the uncertainty measures from the MSI and OLCI spectra are similar, the estimates through OLI-like band settings contain uncertainties 30 to 100% larger for the three variables. The reason for the lower accuracy of Chla estimates is OLI's lack of spectral bands within the 700-800 nm range (Gitelson, 1992), underscoring that MSI and OLCI spectral band configurations in this region introduce more degrees of freedom for quantifying TSS and a cdom (440), despite a cdom (440) being a UV-blue absorbing component (Kirk, 1994). It should also be noted that the OLCI's spectral band configuration appears to enable 10-30% more accurate products over those from MSI, which corroborates the benefits of additional spectral bands for the optical sensing of WQ indicators (Lee et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>The LOO assessment of MDN and other best-performing algorithms for an MSI-like instrument is provided in bar charts for all the available data sources and each WQ component in Fig. 5. Again, MDN produces the most accurate estimates for most datasets. There are exceptions to that, however, where other algorithms like GI2B, Moses-2B, SOLID, and Ficek outperform MDN -though it should be noted that some of these occasionally generate invalid retrievals (e.g., GI2B for Chla &lt; 8 mg m -3 ), rendering them less ideal for global applications. We note that there are datasets for which predictions are associated with considerable uncertainties (e.g., Dataset #39 for Chla and TSS). For these scenarios, MDN typically provides the best approximations. The results do not imply that the dataset is of lower quality; instead, they may signify that the range of measured values from a specific dataset is not well represented within the rest of the dataset.</p>
        <p>A summary of the LOO performance assessment for the MDN model and the second-best algorithms in terms of a median and weighted average of ε is included in Table 3. Here, medians correspond to the median of all ε from all the datasets, and weighted averages represent sum of all ε weighed by the number of samples per dataset normalized by N. The reported uncertainties are often &gt;50% higher than those denoted in Table 2 and bear similar conclusions. For example, the performance metrics suggest that OLCI TSS and a cdom (440) products are expected to be of higher quality than those from MSI and OLI. Analogous to the hold-out analyses (Table 2), it is found that OLI can produce viable TSS and a cdom (440) estimates -although the derived Chla in highly eutrophic waters may be questionable, with more than 80% estimated uncertainties. The large differences in median and weighted average pertain to an unequal sample size of different data sources. For instance, large uncertainties (ε) for small datasets (&lt;10 samples) do not significantly contribute to ultimate uncertainties when reporting weighted average ε, whereas median ε (computed over all datasets) is equally affected by uncertainties in each data source. Among the three sensors and WQ indicators, the largest uncertainties ranging from 47 to 85% correspond to a cdom (440), which may be attributable to the availability of fewer samples and a possible presence of outliers. Moreover, a cdom (440) does not posses uniquely diagnostic features in R rs , and so depends on how well the other components can be estimated, pooling uncertainty into a cdom (440) estimates. Collectively, aside from uncertainties in Chla estimates from OLI, the average ε for all the sensors and WQ indicators for MDN are ~49 and ~ 65% (3 rd and 4 th columns in Table 3), which, together with the average ε from the holdout assessment, provide insights into the expected range of uncertainties, i.e., 26 to 49%, or 26 to 65%, associated with the MDN predictions. Whether median or weighted average uncertainties are examined, MDN WQ estimates are more accurate than those of the second-best models by an average of 11 and 53%, approximated from the mean ratios of columns 3-5 and 4-6 in Table 3, respectively.</p>
        <p>Three near-coincident OLI, MSI, and OLCI WQ maps produced via the MDN model over the San Francisco Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and Upper Klamath Lake (Oregon, USA) are evaluated for multi-mission product consistency. To simplify this analysis, we only focus on ACOLITE R rs products. The images over the San Francisco Bay (Fig. 6) were acquired on March 16 th , 2019, under clear sky conditions with OLI and OLCI imagery taken ~3 min apart, followed by MSI passing over the region ~30 min later. There appears to be a reasonable agreement among the WQ maps, verifying the potential of MDN for producing congruous, practical multimission products. Although the OLI-derived Chla map resembles those of MSI and OLCI in the lower section of the bay, a closer examination of the maps suggests a higher degree of consistency in MSI and OLCI products, which aligns with the assessments in Section 5.1. A notable illustration of the advantage of the higher spatial resolution of OLI and MSI imagery is the identification of the South Bay salt ponds (Warnock et al., 2002) with very high Chla estimates. We also note more resemblance in OLI and MSI TSS maps than in those of MSI-OLCI or OLI-OLCI. For instance, in the mid-bay area (east of San Rafael), a major gradient in TSS is captured by OLI and MSI, whereas the OLCI map shows a more uniform distribution across this region. The between-sensor consistency is highest for the a cdom (440) products in the northern section of the bay; spatial patterns show the largest concentrations (~ 2 m -1 ) in the Sacramento River outlet region and much lower values (0.2-0.3 m -1 ) in the southern section of the bay. In the lower bay, the three maps agree well by predicting values on the order of 1 m -1 . In situ measured Chla and TSS data (Schraga et al., 2020) available through the U.S. Geological Survey's field cruise (https://sfbay.wr.usgs.gov/water-quality-database /) two days prior to the overpass date are in general in agreement with those depicted in our maps. The reported near-surface Chla and TSS measurements in the South Bay at station #24 were ~10.7 mg m -3 and 5 g m -3 , respectively, while they are 9 mg m -3 and 7 g m -3 , respectively, for station #30.</p>
        <p>The mid-section of Chesapeake Bay is mapped by the three missions ~15 min apart from each other on Nov 7 th , 2016 (Fig. 7). In the main stem of the bay, OLI and MSI exhibit very similar spatial patterns of Chla, with OLCI showing slightly elevated concentrations in the bay and along the Potomac River. A single point measurement by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) within the Patuxent River discharge (CB5.1 W) on the same date at ~12:20 UTC (&gt; 3 h before satellite overpasses) indicates 6.2 mg m -3 of Chla for which OLI, MSI, and OLCI approximate 4.0, 2.9, and 9.4 mg m -3 , respectively. The between-sensor consistency is better in the TSS maps, where the most apparent difference appears to be that OLI and MSI resolve more subtle spatial features which are diffused by OLCI's coarser spatial sampling. For the same MD DNR matchup with a measured TSS of 7.4 g m -3 , TSS has been approximated as 4.0, 2.6, and 4.9 g m -3 by OLI, MSI, and OLCI, respectively The a cdom (440) products also match each other quite well with concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 m -1 along the main stem of the bay with OLCI maps illustrating lower CDOM levels. Of further note are the banding effects in MSI products caused by changes in view azimuth angles across odd and even focal plane modules common to pushbroom images (Pahlevan et al., 2017b).</p>
        <p>Shown in Fig. 8 are the maps from July 29 th , 2019, over the Upper Klamath Lake (Oregon), a eutrophic ecosystem known for its major summertime cyanobacteria HAB events (Bradbury et al., 2004). Here, full OLCI lake-wide maps via ACOLITE were not likely producible due to the instrument line-of-sight's turbid atmospheric conditions. The reported near-surface Chla data measured the following day by the USGS Oregon Water Science Center at three locations show concentrations varying within the 27-67 mg m -3 range, suggesting that our estimates are a realistic representation of lake conditions. Chla at sites RS, WR, and MN on July 30 th were reported as 57.0, 27.4, and 66.7 mg m -3 , respectively. The differences in MSI and OLCI products for these three locations lie between 14 and 35%. As in previous examples, a cdom (440) maps appear more consistent than the other two indicators. For instance, there are major distinctions between the OLI TSS map and those produced from MSI and OLCI that agree well with the retrieved spatial patterns. This implies that OLI's lack of spectral information within the 700-800 nm range may render the derived TSS or Chla products inaccurate in hypereutrophic waters. In addition, differences in estimated R rs spectra can introduce large uncertainties in predicted WQ products. The elevated MSI TSS estimates, for example, can be ascribed to such inconsistencies that drive inaccurate retrievals for one or all sensors (see Section 6 for discussions).</p>
        <p>The performance of MDN in practical terms for MSI and OLI matchups has been illustrated in Figs. 9, 10, and 11. Although the Chla matchups cover a broad range of trophic states (0.1 &lt; Chla &lt; 100 mg m -3 ), the range and distribution of TSS and a cdom (440) are relatively marginal and/or sparse. Therefore, in this subsection, for Chla, we only present MSI matchups. For TSS and a cdom (440), because of the availability of larger sample sizes since April 2013, only OLI matchups are analyzed. Although OLI's performance for Chla estimation is subject to large uncertainties (Table 2), we also report OLI Chla matchup analyses in Appendix D (Figure D). Recall that the purpose of this analysis is to gauge the sensitivity of MDN and selected models (Table 1) to σ(R rs ) from SeaDAS and ACOLITE, i.e., a direct comparison of the two processors is not intended. In addition, the number of matchups for each processor and/or sensor is different, making such direct comparisons futile. We further note that OLCI's coarser spatial resolution</p>

N corresponds to the number of samples used for assessing MDN performance. Reported medians correspond to median of all ε from all the datasets, and weighted averages represent the sum of all ε weighed by the number of samples per dataset normalized by N. significantly reduced the number of Chla matchups (Section 3.2), preventing robust statistical analyses.</p>
        <p>As shown in the matchups derived from ACOLITE (Fig. 9), neither MDN nor OC3 is viable for generating Chla products from MSI. MDN approximations from SeaDAS-derived R rs, however are highly more accurate than those estimated from OC3, although the number of matchups is much smaller than that for ACOLITE. In essence, the performance of MDN and other algorithms is likely better evaluated when a wider range of Chla is utilized. It is also shown that 
            <rs type="software">Blend</rs> exhibits large uncertainties for Chla &lt; 10 mg m -3 and MDN predictions are noisy and especially less accurate than OC3 predictions for Chla &lt;1 mg m -3 , indicating that σ(R rs ) primarily affect the retrieval accuracies within this range compared to the demonstrations in Section 5.1.
        </p>
        <p>Predictions of TSS from OLI-derived R rs yields the best result via MDN for almost all statistical descriptors compared to SOLID and Novoa for both AC processors (Fig. 10). The level of improvement is more discernible for SeaDAS R rs implying that ACOLITE may generate biasedhigh R rs causing varying degrees of overestimated TSS through all three algorithms. It also appears that SOLID is more sensitive to σ(R rs ) from ACOLITE than Novoa, while it is marginally less susceptible in the case of SeaDAS. Nonetheless, SOLID operates more uniformly across the dynamic range for both processors.</p>
        <p>Combined a cdom (440) matchups acquired from Lake Winnipeg, Lake Pulse Network (LPN), and Minnesota lakes are depicted in Fig. 11. Overall, MDN outperforms Ficek, despite its parametrization based on a green-red band ratio, which is expected to reduce sensitivity to σ(R rs ).</p>
        <p>The Ficek model tends to overestimate absorption, and its predictions contain significant uncertainties (~ 80%) and noise as inferred by the RMSLD when 
            <rs type="software">SeaDAS</rs> output is examined. The noise is approximately equal for ACOLITE estimates through MDN and Ficek. It is evident that a cdom (440) retrievals are largely affected by σ(R rs ) with QAA-CDOM being the most sensitive for both AC processors (Mannino et al., 2014). The consistently negative biases in MDN predictions from Sea-DAS agree well with the results of previous research (Pahlevan et al., 2021a), corroborating biased low R rs retrievals, particularly in the blue bands. It should also be noted that a preliminary, independent matchup assessment of these three sources manifested more considerable uncertainties for the LPN (N = 29 and 46 for SeaDAS and ACOLITE,
        </p>
        <p>Fig. 6. Water quality maps were produced via MDN for near-concurrent images of OLI, MSI, and OLCI onboard Landsat-8, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-3B, respectively, from March 16 th , 2019. The images were processed to R rs using ACOLITE. Labeled locations correspond to the sites sampled two days prior to the satellite overpasses. The near-surface Chla and TSS measurements for that day at station 24 were reported as ~ 10.7 mg m -3 and 5 g m -3 , respectively, while 9 mg m -3 and 7 g m -3 were measured for station 30. respectively) where impacts of photons emanating from adjacent land were apparent (Pahlevan et al., 2021a;Sterckx et al., 2011).</p>
        <p>We showed that the MDN model has the potential for producing consistent, high-quality WQ products from the past, present, and future satellite observations at a global scale. The model was demonstrated to be capable of generating WQ products spanning a wide range of Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440) that conform to previous studies and expectations. It can also be readily adapted to heritage instruments by applying the respective RSRs. These missions and/or instruments include, but are not limited to, the Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The extension of MDNs to these instruments will enable the construction of a longterm record of WQ variability across scales from watersheds to rivers and to nearshore and offshore areas that represent distinct optical regimes and offers a historical dataset to quantify trends and shifts in WQ indicators.</p>
        <p>To inform a plausible range of uncertainties for the model performance, two commonly used approaches in the machine-learning domain were employed. The LOO method is possibly the preferred assessment subject to the availability of high-quality, methodically measured multisource datasets, as well as datasets with overlapping distributions. This is not currently feasible and, owing to the diversity in in situ measurement methodologies and laboratory analyses likely presents the worstcase model performance per category (Fig. 5). Our reported weighted average and median statistics are, however, reliable metrics to gauge the overall performance, and in combination with the hold-out method, offer a viable range of uncertainties (e.g., 26 to 65%). This implies that if the model is tested with unseen datasets that resemble our development data, the performance would compare with the statistical descriptors reported through the hold-out method (Table 2). Nevertheless, distinct test datasets would yield performances bearing a resemblance to the LOO approach (Table 3).</p>
        <p>We further demonstrated that depending on the AC processor, uncertainties in MDN estimates vary differently for each WQ component. We presented two instances over the San Francisco Bay and Chesapeake Bay, for which MDN generated relatively consistent WQ products across three sensors. Given the range of model uncertainties, however, the difference in products from one sensor to another may reach &gt;100% even when a perfect AC processor is applied (e.g., when ε for a Chla estimate from MSI is -50% and the corresponding ε in an OLCI-derived estimate is 60%). Hence, we surmise that the products are consistent within the algorithm uncertainty and caution users on the interpretation and application until pixel-level uncertainties are provided (see below). These circumstances may exacerbate under more complex atmospheric conditions, such as in the presence of absorbing aerosols, haze, and thin clouds, where σ(R rs ) are relatively high. An excellent example for this scenario is the Upper Klamath Lake demonstration (Fig. 8), where TSS estimates through MSI appear to be higher in magnitude than those of OLI and OLCI. A brief assessment of ACOLITE R rs at a few selected locations verified higher MSI R rs spectra, which is anticipated to lead to overestimated TSS (Woźniak et al., 2010). The extracted spectra for the MN location are illustrated in Fig. 12.</p>
        <p>Potomac River Fig. 7. Similar to Fig. 6, but over the Chesapeake Bay on Nov 7 th , 2016. Near-surface Chla and TSS measurements at CB5.1 W &gt; 3 h before satellite overpasses were reported 6.2 mg m -3 and 7.4 g m -3 , respectively.</p>
        <p>In general, for Chla and TSS, compared to other retrieval algorithms applicable to 0.1 to 20 mg m -3 (or g m -3 ) shown in Figs. 9 and 10, MDN appears to be less sensitive to σ(R rs ) when SeaDAS is employed. MDN predictions of a cdom (440) &gt; 1 m -1 however, are more impacted than those of Ficek, a band ratio model, while QAA-CDOM is proven to be highly sensitive to σ(R rs ). Since MDN applies all the available bands to predict a cdom (440), an AC processor with better performance across all the bands (e.g., iCOR; Pahlevan et al. (2021a)) is expected to return more accurate retrievals. Yet, our matchup assessment using POLYMER R rs (Steinmetz and Ramon, 2018) in conjunction with QAA-CDOM for Lake Winnipeg (not shown here) indicated ~50% uncertainties in a cdom (440), suggesting &gt;30% improved performance compared to MDN and Ficek. This analysis (not shown here) indicates that AC processors that may be impractical for global inland and coastal waters (Pahlevan et al., 2021a) may still offer viable products when combined with algorithms that favorably offset σ(R rs ) for local and/or regional applications (e.g., Lake Winnipeg). More extensive matchup assessments (e.g., Chla &gt; 20 mg m -3 ) are critical to fully characterize the effects of σ(R rs ) on MDN estimates. Our analysis of these two AC processors serves as a sensitivity assessment to set user expectations of model performance in 2018)) in inland waters, i.e., optical water types 4, 5, 6, and 7 in Pahlevan et al. (2021), would lead to the most accurate retrievals. Further, improved handling of relative (sun-sensor) azimuth angles is necessary to characterize surface reflected skylight more accurately in the AC process and minimize banding effects present in OLI and MSI products.</p>
        <p>In the future, one avenue for improving the model performance is to augment the input feature space with band-ratio or line-height features that are expected to diminish the algorithm sensitivity to σ(R rs ) (O'Shea et al., 2021), which are primarily driven by uncertainties in the AC. One should, however, note that incorporating such features may worsen WQ estimates when denominators approach zero, typically due to overcorrections for aerosol contributions. Another line of research that deserves attention is the extent to which TOA reflectance observations across these sensors are consistent. While the consistency between OLI and MSI is monitored on a routine basis (Helder et al., 2018), more efforts are required to quantify their level of agreement with OLCI's TOA products. It is also critical to provide per-pixel uncertainty estimates, which are inherently modeled by the MDN itself, i.e., the network directly parameterizes the uncertainty within the learned covariance matrices of the mixture components (Brando Guillaumes, 2017;Choi et al., 2018). This is directly applicable to the task of providing confidence levels, as the negative log-likelihood loss function used to guide MDN training has been shown to provide accurate characterizations of estimated uncertainty, especially when used in combination with a bootstrap-aggregating (bagging) ensemble (Breiman, 1996;Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). The utility of our products in scientific studies and decision-making activities is meaningful only when pixel-level confidence intervals are generated and reported (IOCCG, 2019).</p>
        <p>While we anticipate the MDN model to produce adequately accurate WQ products at a global scale, we note that locally or regionally tuned ML models should generally be expected to outperform our global model because of the lesser complexity in the range and magnitude of variability across smaller spatial scales (although episodic events may not be well captured in such scenarios). These developments are particularly encouraged in regions where a robust atmospheric correction may not be feasible due to frequent haze, thick aerosol layers, or complex surrounding topography and landcover types that may lead to strong adjacency effects (Cao et al., 2020;Xue et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Building upon previous research efforts, this study formulated, developed, and demonstrated MDNs for simultaneous retrieval of optical WQ indicators, namely Chla, TSS, and a cdom (440), from the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions. With a goal of producing consistent multi-mission global WQ products, to the extent possible, given inherent differences in the spectral, spatial, and radiometric sampling of the sensors, we developed an MDN model using co-located in situ radiometry and WQ data. The model performance was comprehensively compared with that of several existing algorithms using two different methods, which proved advancements in WQ product accuracies. These analyses suggest uncertainties ranging from 26 to 62% for Chla and TSS, and 26 to 91% for a cdom (440) from MSI-and OLCI-like R rs spectra through MDN. For a spectral band configuration like that of OLI, 37 to 85% uncertainties are expected for TSS and a cdom (440), whereas this range spans from 59 to ~100% for Chla. Our demonstration maps exhibited that our model enables consistent multi-mission products within model uncertainties. Chla products for less eutrophic waters (e. g., large estuaries) are anticipated to agree well across OLI, MSI, and OLCI. In contrast, across more eutrophic waters (Chla &gt;5 mg m -3 ), MSI and OLCI should provide consistent products assuming negligible differences in the respective TOA observations. Given high-quality R rs products, we expect TSS and a cdom (440) maps from the three missions to match very well within the uncertainty of the model across a diverse spectrum of optical regimes represented in our development database. Our matchup assessments through samples representing an acceptable range of WQ conditions (&lt; 20 mg m -3 of Chla, &lt; 20 g m -3 of TSS and a cdom (440) &lt; 2.5 m -1 ) suggested that the sensitivity of MDN to σ(R rs ) is subject to the quality of R rs across all the bands and requires further studies at global and regional scales. Although our MDN model is anticipated to offer practical global multi-mission WQ products, local and regional ML models developed using relevant data or tied to a specific AC processor may well be advantageous over our global model; hence, such exercises, particularly in areas with challenging atmospheric and/or aquatic conditions, are immensely encouraged. These developments will likely better serve local communities and water resource managers with high demands for precise and timely WQ monitoring. Future advancements for the MDN model will include adding band-ratio and line-height features to the input feature space to maximize its resistance to σ(R rs ). Moreover, future models will provide accompanying per-pixel uncertainty estimates to allow users to choose fit-for-purpose products. The model is also planned to be extended to heritage instruments (e.g., MERIS) and hyperspectral sensors to demonstrate its utility for constructing long-term WQ products from the past into the future. The spectra correspond to the MN site in the Upper Klamath Lake (Figure 8). A higher magnitude of MSI R rs leads to larger estimates of TSS.</p>
