        <p>Global perturbations to the Early Jurassic environment (∼201 to ∼174 Ma), notably during the Triassic-Jurassic transition and Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, are well studied and largely associated with volcanogenic greenhouse gas emissions released by large igneous provinces. The long-term secular evolution, timing, and pacing of changes in the Early Jurassic carbon cycle that provide context for these events are thus far poorly understood due to a lack of continuous high-resolution δ 13 C data. Here we present a δ 13 C TOC record for the uppermost Rhaetian (Triassic) to Pliensbachian (Lower Jurassic), derived from a calcareous mudstone succession of the exceptionally expanded Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) borehole, Cardigan Bay Basin, Wales, United Kingdom. Combined with existing δ 13 C TOC data from the Toarcian, the compilation covers the entire Lower Jurassic. The dataset reproduces large-amplitude δ 13 C TOC excursions (&gt;3‰) recognized elsewhere, at the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian transition and in the lower Toarcian serpentinum zone, as well as several previously identified medium-amplitude (∼0.5 to 2‰) shifts in the Hettangian to Pliensbachian interval. In addition, multiple hitherto undiscovered isotope shifts of comparable amplitude and stratigraphic extent are recorded, demonstrating that those similar features described earlier from stratigraphically more limited sections are nonunique in a long-term context. These shifts are identified as long-eccentricity (∼405-ky) orbital cycles. Orbital tuning of the δ 13 C TOC record provides the basis for an astrochronological duration estimate for the Pliensbachian and Sinemurian, giving implications for the duration of the Hettangian Stage. Overall the chemostratigraphy illustrates particular sensitivity of the marine carbon cycle to long-eccentricity orbital forcing. astrochronology | δ 13 CTOC | global carbon cycle | Early Jurassic P rominent carbon-isotope excursions (CIEs) are identified globally in strata from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (∼201 Ma) and the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE; ∼183 Ma), both of which are expressed in the δ 13 C values derived from various marine and terrestrial organic and inorganic materials (1)(2)(3). These isotopic events express changes in the δ 13 C composition of the combined global exogenic carbon pool and are linked to the elevated release of isotopically light volcanic, and/or thermogenic, and/or biogenic carbon into the global ocean-atmosphere system (resulting in negative CIEs, e.g., refs. 4 and 5) and global increase in organic-carbon sequestration in marine and/or terrestrial environments (resulting in positive CIEs, e.g., refs. 6 and 7). Bracketed by these globally recognized distinct large-amplitude δ 13 C events (up to 7‰ in marine and terrestrial δ 13 C TOC records), numerous δ 13 C shifts of somewhat lesser magnitude have been identified in the Hettangian to Pliensbachian interval. Stratigraphically expanded shifts were recorded at the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian boundary (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14) and the upper Pliensbachian margaritatus and spinatum zones (10,15,16). Furthermore, multiple stratigraphically less extended short-term δ 13 C shifts of ∼0.5 to 2‰ magnitude have been recognized throughout the Hettangian (17)(18)(19), in the Sinemurian (17,(20)(21)(22)(23)(24), and Pliensbachian (10,11,16,22,(25)(26)(27)(28), where they are recorded as individual shifts or series of shifts within stratigraphically limited sections. Some of these short-term δ 13 C excursions have been shown to represent changes in the supraregional to global carbon cycle, marked by synchronous changes in δ 13 C in marine and terrestrial organic and inorganic substrates and recorded on a wide geographic extent (e.g., refs. 10, 16, 23, and 24). However, due to the previous lack of a continuous dataset capturing and contextualizing all isotopic shifts in a single record, there is no holistic understanding of the global nature, causal mechanisms, and the chronology and pacing of these CIEs. Therefore, these δ 13 C shifts have largely been interpreted as standalone events, linked to a release of 12 C from as-yet-undefined sources, reduced organic productivity (leaving more 12 C in the ocean-atmosphere system) and/or 13 C-depleted carbon sequestration and orbitally forced environmental change affecting the carbon cycle on the scale of Milankovitch cyclicity (17,20,24,25). Evidence for the latter is so far limited to the Hettangian to early Sinemurian and the early Toarcian, where high-resolution isotope records provide the basis for cyclostratigraphic analysis (17)(18)(19)(29)(30)(31).Global perturbations to the Early Jurassic environment (∼201 to ∼174 Ma), notably during the Triassic-Jurassic transition and Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, are well studied and largely associated with volcanogenic greenhouse gas emissions released by large igneous provinces.

        <p>Cyclic variations in Earth's orbit drive periodic changes in the ocean-atmosphere system at a time scale of tens to hundreds of thousands of years. The Mochras δ 13 C TOC record illustrates the continued impact of long-eccentricity (405-ky) orbital forcing on the carbon cycle over at least ∼18 My of Early Jurassic time and emphasizes orbital forcing as a driving mechanism behind medium-amplitude δ 13 C fluctuations superimposed on larger-scale trends that are driven by other variables such as tectonically determined paleogeography and eruption of large igneous provinces. The dataset provides a framework for distinguishing between internal Earth processes and solar-system dynamics as the driving mechanism for Early Jurassic δ 13 C fluctuations and provides an astronomical time scale for the Sinemurian Stage.Cyclic variations in Earth's orbit drive periodic changes in the ocean-atmosphere system at a time scale of tens to hundreds of thousands of years.

        <p>The Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) borehole (hereafter referred to as Mochras) cored the Lower Jurassic of the Cardigan Bay Basin (Wales, United Kingdom), an extensional structure related to the breakup of Pangaea (32). In the Early Jurassic, the basin was located at a midpaleolatitude in the Laurasian Seaway on the northwest fringes of the European shelf (Fig. 1 36). Ammonite biostratigraphy of the core was defined to a zonal and even subzonal level, and all ammonite zones of the Lower Jurassic have been identified with the exception of the lowermost Hettangian tilmanni zone (37,38). Due to the lack of the base-Jurassic biostratigraphic marker Psiloceras spelae, the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the Mochras borehole is placed at a lithological change from calcitic dolostone to calcareous mudstone at ∼1,906.78 mbs (36,38). About 1.7 m of biostratigraphically undefined strata lying between the base Jurassic and the base of the planorbis zone are referred to as "pre-planorbis beds," likely equivalent to the basal Jurassic tilmanni zone (38).The Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) borehole (hereafter referred to as Mochras) cored the Lower Jurassic of the Cardigan Bay Basin (Wales, United Kingdom), an extensional structure related to the breakup of Pangaea (32).

        <p>The relative thinness of the pre-planorbis beds suggests a base-Jurassic hiatus at the sharp lithological change at ∼1,906.78 mbs. A calcite-veined interval in the mid-Sinemurian oxynotum zone may be marked by a fault which, if present at all, cuts out less than one ammonite subzone (36). A small hiatus may also be present at the level of intraformational conglomerate at 627.38 mbs (36) within the upper Toarcian pseudoradiosa zone, and a further unconformity is present at the top of the Lower Jurassic (at 601.85 mbs), where sediments of the uppermost Toarcian aalensis zone are overlain by Paleogene strata (7,36). In all other respects, the Lower Jurassic succession appears to be stratigraphically complete. However, core preservation below ∼1,290 mbs is largely limited to reserve collection samples, each of which aggregate ∼1.4 m intervals of broken core, with consequential reduction of stratigraphic resolution (see Materials and Methods and SI Appendix).The relative thinness of the pre-planorbis beds suggests a base-Jurassic hiatus at the sharp lithological change at ∼1,906.78 mbs.

        <p>The Jurassic succession at Mochras is markedly expanded, with relatively uniform lithology compared to coeval strata elsewhere (38,39). The strata primarily comprise calcareous mudstone, with varying silt and clay content, alternating with strongly bioturbated calcareous siltstone and silty limestone (36). Average Rock-Eval thermal maturation parameter (T max = ∼430 °C) and vitrinite reflectance (R o = 0.38 to 0.63) from previous studies indicate the presence of immature to early mature sedimentary organic matter (7,22,40). δ 13 C data from total organic carbon (δ 13 C TOC ) and carbonates (δ 13 C carb ) generated in previous studies suggest that the Mochras sedimentary archive records the long-term pattern of global carbon-cycle change (7,14,22,41,42).The Jurassic succession at Mochras is markedly expanded, with relatively uniform lithology compared to coeval strata elsewhere (38,39).

        <p>The high-resolution δ 13 C TOC and Rock-Eval data from Mochras presented here for the uppermost Rhaetian to Pliensbachian are combined with published data for the Toarcian derived from the same core (ref. 7 and Fig. 2). The compiled δ 13 C TOC record illustrates significant long-and short-term fluctuations in δ 13 C TOC through the Lower Jurassic of the Mochras core. At a longer time scale, the record shows a long-term ∼5‰ positive shift in δ 13 C TOC from the lowermost Hettangian to upper Sinemurian. The Sinemurian-Pliensbachian boundary is characterized by a symmetrically shaped ∼5‰ negative long-term trend and subsequent "recovery" (upper oxynotum to upper ibex zones, ∼1,360 to ∼1,060 mbs), reaching the lowest values in the lower jamesoni zone. The mid-Pliensbachian interval presents a stable plateau in δ 13 C TOC , followed by the upper margaritatus zone (subnodosus and gibbosus subzones) where δ 13 C TOC values rise gradually and culminate in an abrupt ∼2‰ positive excursion in the upper margaritatus zone (∼930 to ∼926 mbs). The margaritatus-spinatum zone boundary is marked by a sharp ∼4‰ drop in organic carbonisotope ratios, followed by a gradual positive shift throughout the spinatum zone. The Toarcian record comprises a lower Toarcian overarching positive CIE interrupted by the large negative CIE associated with the T-OAE, as described in previous studies (7,14,22,41). All larger-scale trends in the δ 13 C TOC data are reproduced in δ 13 C wood presented for the upper Sinemurian to Toarcian, although the latter dataset shows a larger degree of variability (Fig. 2). At a decameter scale, the δ 13 C TOC record is characterized by consecutive alternating positive and negative shifts of ∼0.5 to 2‰ magnitude, superimposed on the observed long-term isotopic trends. These fluctuations in δ 13 C TOC , hereafter referred to as mediumamplitude shifts, are particularly well-defined in the Hettangian to uppermost Sinemurian (between 1,906.78 and 1,340 mbs) and the mid-Pliensbachian ibex to lower margaritatus zones (between 1,120 and 980 mbs). The individual shifts appear larger in magnitude and more stratigraphically extensive in the Hettangian and Sinemurian compared with those in the Pliensbachian. Superimposed on these medium-amplitude shifts, fluctuations in δ 13 C TOC of up to 2‰ on a meter to centimeter scale occur, with larger magnitudes in the upper Sinemurian and Pliensbachian likely being an artifact of differing sample resolution.The high-resolution δ 13 C TOC and Rock-Eval data from Mochras presented here for the uppermost Rhaetian to Pliensbachian are combined with published data for the Toarcian derived from the same core (ref. 7 and Fig. 2).

        <p>The calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) content of the Mochras strata is highly variable (∼0.6 to 95%; Fig. 2). The long-term shifts in CaCO 3 appear to negatively correlate with the broad δ 13 C TOC trends, with the exception of the upper Pliensbachian and lower Toarcian successions. On a decameter scale, the CaCO 3 shows a clear fluctuation in the Hettangian and Sinemurian interval, but the pattern does not correspond to the medium-scale shifts in δ 13 C TOC. The relatively higher variability in CaCO 3 on a meter to decameter scale over the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian transition and the upper Pliensbachian interval is associated with the higher data resolution obtained in these intervals. The total organic carbon (TOC) content and hydrogen index (HI) values are generally low throughout the Hettangian to Pliensbachian of the Mochras core (Fig. 2). TOC and HI values in the Hettangian and most of the Sinemurian (∼1.5 wt % and ∼80 mg HC/g TOC on average, respectively) notably increase in the upper Sinemurian to lower Pliensbachian (2.6 wt %, up to 380 mg HC/g TOC, respectively) and are moderately elevated through the Pliensbachian (∼1.4 wt % and ∼170 mg HC/g TOC on average, respectively).The calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) content of the Mochras strata is highly variable (∼0.6 to 95%; Fig. 2).

        <p>The increase in both TOC and HI accompanies the downgoing limb of the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian negative CIE, and some stratigraphic intervals with distinctly enhanced TOC and HI values also occur in the Hettangian and Sinemurian, coinciding with minimum values in δ 13 C TOC (for example in the angulata, bucklandi, and lower raricostatum zones). Similarly, the lowermost Jurassic sediments of the pre-planorbis beds and planorbis zone are also marked by distinctly elevated TOC and HI values (of 3.2 wt % and up to 660 mg HC/g TOC, respectively), coinciding with negative δ 13 C TOC values of -28‰ (Fig. 2). Overall, there is no clear correlation between TOC and δ 13 C TOC (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).The increase in both TOC and HI accompanies the downgoing limb of the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian negative CIE, and some stratigraphic intervals with distinctly enhanced TOC and HI values also occur in the Hettangian and Sinemurian, coinciding with minimum values in δ 13 C TOC (for example in the angulata, bucklandi, and lower raricostatum zones).

        <p>Predominant components of sedimentary organic matter identified by maceral analysis are liptinites, most of which are represented by liptodetrinite (up to 96.7 vol %; SI Appendix, Fig. S7), a product of aerobic and mechanic degradation of liptinitic macerals (43). Markedly smaller but variable amounts of lessdegraded liptinite macerals are algal in origin (alginite). Bituminite, also known as amorphous organic matter (AOM), which originates from anaerobic decomposition of algae and faunal plankton under anoxic conditions (44,45), is primarily present in Pliensbachian samples (up to 24 vol %). Terrestrial organic matter comprising coal clasts, vitrinite, inertinite, sporinite, and cutinite accounts for variable relative amounts (3.3 to 58.8 vol %) of the total organic matter. Notably, the Pliensbachian samples contain a larger relative amount of terrestrially derived organic matter and bituminite compared to the Hettangian and Sinemurian samples. This stratigraphic trend is also reflected in the comparatively high abundance of macrofossil wood in the Pliensbachian and Toarcian part of the core, contrasting with very rare occurrences in the Hettangian and Sinemurian.Predominant components of sedimentary organic matter identified by maceral analysis are liptinites, most of which are represented by liptodetrinite (up to 96.7 vol %; SI Appendix, Fig. S7), a product of aerobic and mechanic degradation of liptinitic macerals (43).

        <p>The formation of liptodetrinite, the predominant organic component in the bulk organic matter assemblage, is associated with physical disintegration of liptinite macerals in the water column and is indicative of extensive water-column circulation and high oxygen availability (45). The precursors of liptodetrinite can be of marine-aquatic origin or derive from terrestrial liptinites, such as sporinite and cutinite (46). The highly degraded shape of liptodetrinite macerals observed in Mochras (SI Appendix, Fig. S6) suggests fragile marine organic matter such as algae as primary precursor. The marine origin of the degraded particles is further supported by its fluorescence. The fluorescence of terrestrial organic matter should decrease with greater biodegradation (47) but in the studied samples appears higher compared to intact terrestrial liptinite. The HI values recorded in Mochras are likely highly compromised as a result of aerobic bacterial degradation of initially hydrogen-rich marine organic matter and are therefore not indicative for the primary source of the organic matter.The formation of liptodetrinite, the predominant organic component in the bulk organic matter assemblage, is associated with physical disintegration of liptinite macerals in the water column and is indicative of extensive water-column circulation and high oxygen availability (45).

The fluorescence of terrestrial organic matter should decrease with greater biodegradation (47) but in the studied samples appears higher compared to intact terrestrial liptinite. The HI values recorded in Mochras are likely highly compromised as a result of aerobic bacterial degradation of initially hydrogen-rich marine organic matter and are therefore not indicative for the primary source of the organic matter.</p>
        <p>Comparably larger relative amounts of bituminite (AOM) in the upper Pliensbachian strata indicate more anaerobic bottomwater conditions, resulting in preservation of lipid and hydrogenrich organic matter. An increase in AOM and foraminifera organic inner wall linings was previously reported from Mochras, concomitant with the increase in TOC in the raricostatum to davoei zones (22). The elevated TOC and HI values around the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian transition were interpreted to result from both the increase in organic flux to the seafloor and low-oxygen bottom waters (22). Elevated TOC and HI values manifested on a smaller (decameter) scale and stratigraphically coincident with negative CIEs (well-expressed, for example, in the angulata, bucklandi, and lower obtusum zones) may similarly be linked to enhanced preservation of organic matter as a response to redox conditions.Comparably larger relative amounts of bituminite (AOM) in the upper Pliensbachian strata indicate more anaerobic bottomwater conditions, resulting in preservation of lipid and hydrogenrich organic matter.

        <p>The Lower Jurassic δ 13 C TOC Record in the Mochras Core. The largemagnitude CIEs (&gt;3‰) recorded in the Mochras core are the same as isotope events that have been previously recorded elsewhere, such as the early Toarcian negative CIE, punctuating an overarching positive excursion, in the tenuicostatumserpentinum zones (7,14,22,41) and the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian boundary negative CIE, both of which have been interpreted as due to increased release of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system (4,5,39). Markedly well-expressed in the Mochras δ 13 C TOC record is an upper Pliensbachian (uppermost margaritatus zone) negative CIE, revealing a sharp ∼4‰ downward shift following the upper margaritatus positive CIE. Both these CIEs have been recognized in multiple European basins (10,15,25,48), as well as in the North American realm (16). The positive margaritatus zone CIE has been linked to widespread deposition of isotopically light organic matter during high sea levels and warm climates (6,25,49), with no apparent temporal link to large-scale volcanism (16). Subsequent cooling, associated sea-level fall, and restored water-column mixing have been suggested to have released accumulated light carbon through sediment reworking and oxidative and heterotrophic remobilization, causing the negative CIE in the uppermost margaritatus zone (8,10,26,50,51). Similarly, the influx (upwelling/recycling) of 12 C-rich deep waters associated with a climatic cooling trend has been suggested as an alternative driving mechanism for the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian boundary negative CIE (11).The Lower Jurassic δ 13 C TOC Record in the Mochras Core.

        <p>The clear parallelism between fossil plant matter and bulk organic δ 13 C records demonstrates, however, that the oceanatmosphere and biosphere carbon reservoirs were simultaneously affected and the shifts in δ 13 C TOC can thus not solely be explained with oceanographic changes such as redox-related preservation or upwelling of 12 C-enriched deep waters. Despite possible circulation-related redox changes throughout the strata, notably around the Sinemurian-Pliensbachian transition and the upper Pliensbachian (22,26,48), the δ 13 C wood record presented here signifies that Mochras appears to record the global δ 13 C evolution.The clear parallelism between fossil plant matter and bulk organic δ 13 C records demonstrates, however, that the oceanatmosphere and biosphere carbon reservoirs were simultaneously affected and the shifts in δ 13 C TOC can thus not solely be explained with oceanographic changes such as redox-related preservation or upwelling of 12 C-enriched deep waters.

They are expressed throughout the section but appear larger in magnitude in the Hettangian and Sinemurian stratigraphic interval, the deposition of which was associated with more oxygenated bottom waters.The most dominant feature illustrated by the Mochras record is, however, the periodic appearance of medium-amplitude (∼0.5 to 2‰) fluctuations on a decameter scale throughout the interval studied, superimposed on the longer-term isotopic shifts discussed above.

        <p>Several medium-amplitude CIEs observed in Mochras have previously also been identified in other δ 13 C records covering shorter stratigraphic intervals from geographically widespread sections, and obtained from different carbon substrates, demonstrating that these shifts do not represent a local phenomenon restricted to the Cardigan Bay Basin. In the Sinemurian, for example, a positive CIE in the turneri zone is also recorded in δ 13 C TOC on the Dorset coast of the United Kingdom (20) and in western North America (23). A negative CIE in the obtusum-oxynotum zones is also present in previously published δ 13 C records of bulk organic matter, belemnites, and terrestrially derived palynomorphs from Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, and the δ 13 C TOC records from Robin Hood's Bay, United Kingdom and Sancerre-Couy, France (15,21,24,42). Although biostratigraphically less well constrained, a similar pattern in δ 13 C TOC has been observed in records from Italy and Morocco (12,52). Likewise, multiple likely coeval medium-amplitude shifts in δ 13 C within the Pliensbachian ibex and davoei zones are recorded on a supraregional scale, including the European and African Tethyan margin (9-11, 14, 15, 25, 27, 28, 48, 50, 53). Exceptionally well-expressed are multiple consecutive shifts recorded in δ 13 C carb derived from belemnites from Dorset, United Kingdom, throughout the Pliensbachian jamesoni, ibex, and lower davoei zones (11).

        <p>These CIEs have thus far been discussed as single or episodic events, but as aggregated here in a continuous record and viewed collectively in the overall stratigraphic context they appear as elements in a regular series. Based on the occurrence, in multiple carbon substrates and in various sedimentary basins, it seems apparent that most, if not all, of the medium-amplitude CIEs recorded in the Mochras core reflect changes in the δ 13 C composition of an at least supraregional marine dissolved inorganic carbon pool.These CIEs have thus far been discussed as single or episodic events, but as aggregated here in a continuous record and viewed collectively in the overall stratigraphic context they appear as elements in a regular series.

The δ 13 C TOC data presented here point to a common and strongly repetitive, supraregionally to globally acting driving force pacing the observed fluctuations in δ 13 C TOC and concomitant shifts in δ 13 C carb . The most plausible driving mechanism acting continuously over an extended time interval is orbital forcing. Compared to shorter Milankovitch periodicities, the long-eccentricity (405-ky) orbital signal can be well expressed in δ 13 C records due to the long residence time of carbon in the ocean-atmosphere system and the associated "memory effect" of carbon in the oceans (54,55).Pacing of Early Jurassic Carbon-Cycle Fluctuations.

        <p>Thus far, it has not been resolved how eccentricity forcing impacts the carbon cycle and the δ 13 C signature. Orbital eccentricity forcing modulates the precessional amplitude of Earth's insolation, leading to cyclic changes in seasonal contrasts, with eccentricity maxima marked by high seasonal contrasts and short but intense "monsoon-like" wet intervals followed by prolonged dry periods, whereas eccentricity minima are characterized by more uniform precipitation patterns (57)(58)(59). High precipitation and weathering rates during the high-eccentricity wet season is associated with increased continental runoff and fluvial freshwater inputs, as well as increased nutrient and terrestrial organic and inorganic carbon transfer into the oceans, resulting in productivity blooms, a stratified water column, and bottom-water anoxia (58). During the dry season, oxidation of terrestrial organic matter is favored on land, restored water-column mixing oxidizes marine organic matter, and regional carbonate production increases. More stable conditions during eccentricity minima lead to a constant input of freshwater, nutrients, and carbon, resulting in constant productivity rates, persistent watermass stratification, and continuous accumulation of organic-rich deposits in the ocean, as well as increased net production of terrestrial biomass and its storage in stable tropical soils, wetlands, and peats (58,60,61). These eccentricity-paced variations in the accumulation and remineralization of marine and terrestrial organic carbon, and the ratio between burial flux of organic carbon and the accumulation rate of inorganic (carbonate) carbon, impact the oceanic carbon pool and are sufficient to drive δ 13 C fluctuations (58,(60)(61)(62)(63).Thus far, it has not been resolved how eccentricity forcing impacts the carbon cycle and the δ 13 C signature.

        <p>The negative shifts in δ 13 C TOC in Mochras may thus reflect enhanced preservation of isotopically light organic matter in response to orbitally paced redox conditions in the water column and/or bottom waters and sediments. The more distinct expression and larger magnitude of δ 13 C TOC shifts in the Hettangian to upper Sinemurian strata may be linked to the more oxygenated bottom-water conditions that were likely more susceptible to the orbitally paced redox changes.The negative shifts in δ 13 C TOC in Mochras may thus reflect enhanced preservation of isotopically light organic matter in response to orbitally paced redox conditions in the water column and/or bottom waters and sediments.

        <p>Increased drawdown of 12 C-enriched organic matter is, however, generally associated with positive shifts in δ 13 C. Conversely, in Mochras, increased TOC values correspond to negative isotope shifts instead (for example, in the angulata and bucklandi zones), but overall no correlation between TOC and δ 13 C TOC is apparent. Other Lower Jurassic geochemical records show that medium-amplitude shifts are preceded by, rather than concomitant with, increased TOC intervals (11,26). This offset may suggest that the accumulation of organic matter took place elsewhere, outside the Cardigan Bay Basin. Furthermore, the long-eccentricity (405-ky) cycles in δ 13 C TOC appear independent of the overall climatic background, as demonstrated by the isotope shifts expressed during the late Pliensbachian, which represents a climatically cold interval (8,51,64) and may be less conducive for the development of high seasonal contrasts.Increased drawdown of 12 C-enriched organic matter is, however, generally associated with positive shifts in δ 13 C.

        <p>Early Jurassic Astronomical Time Scale. Due to the stability of the orbital long-eccentricity cycle over the past 215 My (65), orbital tuning of datasets encoding this astronomical metronome can provide reliable time constraints. The 405-ky tuned δ 13 C TOC record from Mochras shows dominant spectral peaks corresponding to amplitude modulation, short eccentricity, and obliquity Milankovitch cycles (Fig. 4). A floating time scale based on the tuned dataset implies a duration of 8.8 My for the Pliensbachian (Fig. 4), which is closely comparable to the cyclostratigraphic duration estimate obtained from elemental calcium concentrations from the same core (8.7 My;ref. 39). The tuned δ 13 C TOC record of the preceding stage provides a direct cyclostratigraphic duration estimate for the Sinemurian and its constituent ammonite zones (Fig. 4). If all cycles were identified correctly, the stage duration of ∼6.6 My defined herein is shorter compared with the previous estimate of 7.6 My, which is based on the assumed linear decrease in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of belemnite rostra extracted from the Belemnite Marls, Dorset, United Kingdom (66). Some uncertainty regarding cycle allocation associated with a comparably weak spectral peak in the original and tuned dataset appears in the upper Sinemurian oxynotum zone (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S2). In this stratigraphic interval, the potential stratigraphic break associated with the possible occurrence of a fault and/or the transition between available sample types and data resolution (transition between samples taken from preserved core slabs and reserve bags) may have led to imprecise cycle allocation. Assuming a relatively uniform sedimentation rate, and considering that the fault, if present, cuts out less than one ammonite subzone, it appears most likely that, if at all, not more than one cycle may be missing in this stratigraphic interval.Early Jurassic Astronomical Time Scale.

        <p>Controversial astronomical duration estimates are currently debated for the Hettangian Stage, ranging between 1.7/1.9 My and 4.1 My (17-19, 67, 68).

For this study, bulk rock samples between 1,290 and 863.3 mbs were collected from well-preserved core slabs at a 30-cm to 60-cm resolution. Bulk-rock samples below the ∼1,290 mbs level were largely sampled from reserve collections, each of which aggregate ∼1.4 m intervals of broken core. A single sample was taken from each bag and referred to the depth of the midpoint of the sampled interval (reserve bag samples marked as white squares in Fig. 2). Macroscopic fossil plant material was extracted from reserve bags only. The sample resolution, ammonite and foraminiferal biostratigraphy, and a lithological log of the Mochras drill core are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1.
