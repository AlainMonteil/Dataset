        <p>Emissions of ozone-depleting substances, including trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), have decreased since the mid-1980s in response to the Montreal Protocol 1,2 . Recently, an unexpected increase in CFC-11 emissions since 2013 was reported, with much of the global rise attributed to emissions from eastern China 3,4 . Here we use high-frequency atmospheric mole fraction observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, to investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern China. We find that CFC-11 emissions returned to pre-2013 levels in 2019 (5.0 ± 1.0 Gg yr -1 in 2019 compared to 7.2 ± 1.5 Gg yr -1 for 2008 -2012, 1 s.d.), decreasing by 10 ± 3 Gg yr -1 since 2014 -2017.

        <p>were higher than expected after 2013 and then declined one to two years prior to the CFC-11 emissions reduction. This suggests CFC-11 production in eastern China after the mandated global phase-out, and a subsequent decline in production during 2017-2018. We estimate that the CFC-11 bank in eastern China is up to 112 Gg larger in 2019 compared to pre-2013, most likely as a result of recent production. Nevertheless, it seems that any substantial delay in ozone layer recovery has been avoided, perhaps due to timely reporting 3,4 and subsequent action by industry and government in China 5,6 .were higher than expected after 2013 and then declined one to two years prior to the CFC-11 emissions reduction.

        <p>An unexpected rise in global emissions of CFC-11 beginning in 2013 was detected by two independent global atmospheric measurement networks, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 3 and the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) 4,7 . Data collected in the background atmosphere were used to infer a rise in global emissions of 17 ± 3 Gg yr -1 (NOAA) or 11 ± 3 Gg yr -1 (AGAGE) for 2014 -2017, compared to 2008 -2012 4 . The enhanced emissions to date are unlikely to lead to a substantial delay in ozone recovery, although a delay of years to decades would be expected if emissions continued at the levels observed between 2014 and 2017 8,9 .An unexpected rise in global emissions of CFC-11 beginning in 2013 was detected by two independent global atmospheric measurement networks, operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 3 and the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) 4,7 .

        <p>Under the Montreal Protocol, production and consumption of CFC-11 for emissive applications was phased-out globally in 2010. Before the phase-out, CFC-11 was used initially as a propellant gas in aerosol cans, as a refrigerant in chillers, and later as a blowing and insulating agent in the manufacture of foams in buildings and domestic appliances 10 . As a result, substantial "banks'' of CFC-11 remain (i.e. CFC-11 contained in foams and chillers), and their emissions are expected to continue for several decades at a gradually declining rate 11 . Largely because the observed emissions rise since 2013 was contrary to the expectation of globally and regionally falling emissions from banks, it was concluded that the rise since 2013 was indicative of new CFC-11 production, most likely for the manufacture of closed-cell foams 10 , which had not been reported to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 3,4 .Under the Montreal Protocol, production and consumption of CFC-11 for emissive applications was phased-out globally in 2010.

        <p>The previously reported 4 increase in emissions of 7 ± 3 Gg yr -1 , for the period 2014-2017 compared with 2008-2012, from a region denoted "eastern mainland China", has been revised slightly to 7 ± 4 Gg yr -1 in this study (see Methods). The estimate was made by analysis of observations from the AGAGE Gosan station on Jeju Island, South Korea, and the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) station on Hateruma Island, Japan. The emissions increase was centred on Shandong and Hebei provinces; Anhui, Beijing, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhejiang provinces were included in the eastern mainland China region, but showed lower or near-zero increases, or decreases, in emissions. An increase in emissions from eastern China has since been confirmed by independent atmospheric data from Taiwan 12 . In addition, Chinese authorities have reported that, during inspections of several industrial facilities, small quantities (tens of tonnes) of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), including CFC-11, had been seized, suggesting new production of CFC-11 5,6 .The previously reported 4 increase in emissions of 7 ± 3 Gg yr -1 , for the period 2014-2017 compared with 2008-2012, from a region denoted "eastern mainland China", has been revised slightly to 7 ± 4 Gg yr -1 in this study (see Methods).

        <p>In 2018 and 2019, data from Gosan and Hateruma indicate a decline in emissions from eastern Asia (Figure 1). This conclusion can be drawn from the decrease of atmospheric CFC-11 mole fraction enhancements above background levels after 2017, suggesting a fall in emissions from regions to which the monitoring stations are sensitive (see Extended Figure 1). Of the two stations, Gosan is more strongly influenced by industrialised sources in north-eastern China, where the post-2012 emission rise was centred. Unfortunately, substantial periods of instrumental down-time occurred at Gosan in 2016, 2017 and 2018 as a result of typhoon-related damage. These periods of missing data, combined with seasonal changes in meteorology, make it difficult to determine whether emissions changed suddenly, or more gradually throughout 2018 and 2019 (see Methods).In 2018 and 2019, data from Gosan and Hateruma indicate a decline in emissions from eastern Asia (Figure 1).

        <p>The quantification and attribution of emissions on regional scales using atmospheric mole fraction data by inverse modelling requires models of atmospheric transport that account for meteorological influences on the observed CFC-11 mole fractions. Here, we update inverse estimates of CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia using Gosan and Hateruma data, based on two atmospheric chemical transport models, NAME and FLEXPART (see Methods), and four independent statistical approaches (denoted NAME-HB, NAME-InTEM, FLEXPART-MIT and FLEXPART-Empa) 4 . Consistent with the observed decline in above-baseline mole fractions (Extended Figure 2), all modelling approaches derive a drop in CFC-11 emissions after 2017 (Figure 2); multi-inversion mean emissions in 2019 were 10 ± 3 Gg yr -1 lower than 2014 -2017.The quantification and attribution of emissions on regional scales using atmospheric mole fraction data by inverse modelling requires models of atmospheric transport that account for meteorological influences on the observed CFC-11 mole fractions.

        <p>Emissions during 2018 appear to be intermediate between those derived for 2014-2017 and 2019, which may suggest a gradual reduction in emissions between 2018 and 2019, or could imply a step-change at some point during 2018 (see Methods). Average emissions for the year 2019 from the four inverse methods, were 5.0 ± 1.0 Gg yr -1 , which is consistent, within 1-sigma uncertainty, with the emissions of 7.2 ± 1.5 Gg yr -1 inferred for the period 2008 -2012 (i.e. before the new emissions rise). Similar to our previous study 4 , these values represent a multi-inversion average, assuming fully correlated uncertainties (see Methods). Analysis of the spatial distribution of the derived emissions reveals that the maximum over Shandong and Hebei between 2014 -2017 is largely absent in 2019 (Figure 3 and Extended Data Figure 3). The revised 7 ± 4 Gg yr -1 estimated increase in emissions in 2014-2017 compared with 2008-2012 from eastern China explains 60 ± 40% of the global emissions rise over the same period (the global increase has also been revised using a correction for the influence of atmospheric dynamics 13 ). As in eastern Asia, global background CFC-11 atmospheric monitoring data provide evidence that, in 2019, global emissions returned to levels consistent with those observed before 2013 13 . Our estimated emissions reduction of 10 ± 3 Gg yr -1 from eastern China between 2014-2017 and 2019 accounts for 60 ± 30% of the global decline during the same period. We do not know where the remaining emissions changes have occurred, as demonstrated in our previous study, which found no evidence of an emission increase in western North America, north-west Europe or southern Australia, where AGAGE stations are located 4 . This result highlights that substantial changes in the emissions of key ODSs have likely occurred in regions not directly sensed by downwind atmospheric measurement stations.Emissions during 2018 appear to be intermediate between those derived for 2014-2017 and 2019, which may suggest a gradual reduction in emissions between 2018 and 2019, or could imply a step-change at some point during 2018 (see Methods).

        <p>Assuming that unreported CFC-11 production in eastern mainland China started in 2013 and ended in 2018, we can make an estimate of the excess emissions above those originating only from banks (see Methods). Based on our inferred emissions estimates, integrated excess emissions between 2013 and 2018 (inclusive) were 46 (34-60) Gg (median and 95% uncertainty) from eastern China, or 42 (28-56) Gg with a more constrained production scenario (see Methods). This estimate includes fugitive emissions during production of CFC-11, emissions that occurred at the point of use (e.g. as a blowing agent), and those resulting from any addition to, and subsequent emission from the bank (see Methods).Assuming that unreported CFC-11 production in eastern mainland China started in 2013 and ended in 2018, we can make an estimate of the excess emissions above those originating only from banks (see Methods).

        <p>Two substances whose emissions were historically related to CFC-11 production 10 are CCl4, the chemical feedstock for CFC-11, and CFC-12, which is typically co-produced with CFC-11.Two substances whose emissions were historically related to CFC-11 production 10 are CCl4, the chemical feedstock for CFC-11, and CFC-12, which is typically co-produced with CFC-11.</p>
        <p>Emissions of CCl4 had increased from north-eastern China around the same period as the rise in CFC-11 emissions 14 . However, its emissions are known to be associated with several industrial activities, such as the manufacture of other chloromethanes, so it is not possible to conclusively attribute this change to CFC-11 production 15,16 . The ratio of co-produced CFC-12 to CFC-11 can be highly variable 10 as the emissions ratio of CFC-12 relative to CFC-11 depends on whether the CFC-12 was vented to the atmosphere, destroyed, stockpiled, or banked in new equipment.Emissions of CCl4 had increased from north-eastern China around the same period as the rise in CFC-11 emissions 14 .

        <p>Previous investigation did not find evidence for an abrupt increase in CFC-12 emissions since 2013, although a detailed inverse analysis was not carried out 4 . Notwithstanding the above caveats, further information about CFC-11 production may be gleaned through analysis of CFC-12 and CCl4 emissions from eastern China, even though the timing and location of the recent increase and decrease in regional CFC-11 emissions need not necessarily coincide with those of its production.Previous investigation did not find evidence for an abrupt increase in CFC-12 emissions since 2013, although a detailed inverse analysis was not carried out 4 .

        <p>Inverse modelling estimates of CCl4 and CFC-12 emissions from eastern China using Gosan data show similarities to the changes in CFC-11 emissions between 2008 and 2019 (Figure 2 and Extended Data Figure 4; Hateruma observations were not available throughout this period for these compounds). All three compounds exhibit a small peak in emissions in 2010, perhaps related to the onset of Montreal Protocol restrictions, although, due to the lack of emissions data before 2008, we cannot infer whether pre-2010 emissions are anomalously low or 2010 emissions are larger than expected. In contrast to bottom-up estimates, inverse modelling-derived emissions of CCl4 increased after 2012, growing from 6.0 ± 1.4 Gg yr -1 for 2011 -2012 to 10.9 ± 2.0 Gg yr -1 for 2014 -2017. These emissions subsequently declined around 2017, returning to 6.2 ± 1.4 Gg yr -1 in 2018 -2019, similar to the 2011 -2012 estimates. Consistent with our earlier qualitative findings 4 , eastern China emissions of CFC-12 did not change significantly between 2011 -2012 and 2014 -2017 (3.0 ± 1.2 Gg yr -1 , compared to 3.1 ± 1.2 Gg yr -1 , respectively). However, CFC-12 emissions did decline substantially after 2016, reaching 0.7 ± 0.9 Gg yr -1 , indistinguishable from zero, for 2017 -2019. One possible explanation for the CFC-12 emissions trend is that the expected decline in emissions from CFC-12 banks 17 was approximately equal to the increasing production-related emissions, which then ceased around 2017, and thus no appreciable emissions change was observed before 2017. Under this assumption, we find cumulative excess emissions of 8 ± 4 Gg for CFC-12 between 2013 and 2018 (inclusive, see Methods). For CCl4, overall enhanced emissions were 23 ± 6 Gg during this period. Our results show that emissions of CCl4 and CFC-12 dropped either one (CCl4) or two (CFC-12) years before those of CFC-11, which may be consistent with a fall in CFC-11 production before stockpiled CFC-11 was used. The possibility of an increase in CFC-11 emissions was reported at scientific meetings from May 2016 onwards 18,19 , two years before the first peer-reviewed publication 3 . Therefore, it is possible that a drop in production during 2017 (as implied by CFC-12 emissions trends), or 2018 (as implied by CCl4) could have followed from the first public dissemination of anomalous background CFC-11 trends.Inverse modelling estimates of CCl4 and CFC-12 emissions from eastern China using Gosan data show similarities to the changes in CFC-11 emissions between 2008 and 2019 (Figure 2 and Extended Data Figure 4; Hateruma observations were not available throughout this period for these compounds).

        <p>A simple process model and some simplifying assumptions can be used to determine the level of CFC-11 production in eastern China that is consistent with our estimates of integrated excess emissions of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 during 2013-2018 (see Methods). A recent assessment 10 found that CFC-11 was most likely used to manufacture closed-cell foams, with a release fraction of 25-35% of the produced CFC-11. Using these findings to constrain the process model, unreported production may be up to 165 Gg (median of 118 Gg, lower bound of 74 Gg), with an increase in the 2019 bank of up to 112 Gg (median of 75 Gg, lower bound of 46 Gg; Extended Data Table 2). These results are also supported by an estimate with no explicit assumptions about the target species during production nor its usage application (Extended Data Table 3), which suggest that total unreported production of CFC-11 was up to 109 Gg between 2013-2018 (95% uncertainty interval upper bound, with a median of 62 Gg and lower bound of 44 Gg). This finding results in an increase in the bank size in 2019 of up to 58 Gg (lower bound of 0 Gg, median of 14 Gg), reflecting a short-term CFC-11 release during its production and at the point of use (e.g. during foam manufacture) of between 40% and 100% of the total amount produced.A simple process model and some simplifying assumptions can be used to determine the level of CFC-11 production in eastern China that is consistent with our estimates of integrated excess emissions of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 during 2013-2018 (see Methods).

        <p>The integrated excess emissions due to new production, use and increased bank size between 2013 and 2018 for all three species are equivalent to 71 (52-90) Gg of CFC-11 emissions (median and 95% uncertainty, see Methods) in terms of the impact on stratospheric ozone and 362 (247-479) Tg CO2 in terms of the impact on climate over a 100-year time horizon, equivalent to around 4% of China's 2018 fossil fuel CO2 emissions 20 . If we assume that all of the inferred CFC-11 production within eastern China will ultimately be released to the atmosphere, and include the associated excess emissions of CCl4 and CFC-12 already seen, total Antarctic ozone loss associated with these additional ODS emissions 8 will be less than 0.2% (see Methods). Therefore, we can conclude that substantial future stratospheric ozone depletion from renewed, unreported production of CFC-11 and associated ODS from eastern China has been avoided, perhaps instigated by the timely reporting of increased emissions. Coincident with our findings for eastern China, there is evidence that a return to an emissions trajectory more consistent with Montreal Protocol regulations has also taken place globally 13 . These findings underscore the rapid progress that has been made to address this important issue at both regional and global scales. However, due to gaps in the global ODS monitoring system, it remains unclear which other parts of the world contributed to 40 ± 40% of the global emission rise, or 40 ± 30% of the subsequent fall, that could not be attributed to eastern China.The integrated excess emissions due to new production, use and increased bank size between 2013 and 2018 for all three species are equivalent to 71 (52-90) Gg of CFC-11 emissions (median and 95% uncertainty, see Methods) in terms of the impact on stratospheric ozone and 362 (247-479) Tg CO2 in terms of the impact on climate over a 100-year time horizon, equivalent to around 4% of China's 2018 fossil fuel CO2 emissions 20 .

Coincident with our findings for eastern China, there is evidence that a return to an emissions trajectory more consistent with Montreal Protocol regulations has also taken place globally 13 . These findings underscore the rapid progress that has been made to address this important issue at both regional and global scales. However, due to gaps in the global ODS monitoring system, it remains unclear which other parts of the world contributed to 40 ± 40% of the global emission rise, or 40 ± 30% of the subsequent fall, that could not be attributed to eastern China.</p>

Compounded by missing data, this makes it difficult to determine when sub-annual emissions changes occurred.Gosan measurement station has several large data gaps in 2016, 2017 and 2018 due to periods of instrumental down-time as a result of typhoon-related damage.

The inversion is not performed on a fixed underlying grid, but a variable basis function representation, which is explored during the inversion 28 , where the highest allowable spatial resolution is the NAME output resolution. The treatment of the measurement data averaging, model-measurement error and prior constraints on the scaling of the a priori emissions and boundary conditions were the same for all three gases. A priori estimates of CFC-12 for all years were 20 Gg yr -1 in the inner domain, which were distributed uniformly over land (not water), and 20 Gg yr -1 in the outer domain (see our previous study 4 for definitions of these domains). For CFC-12, a priori mole fraction concentrations at the domain boundary were equal to the monthly baseline mole fraction derived from measurements at the Mace Head measurement site in Ireland. The NAME-HB a priori emissions estimates for CCl4 for each country were taken from an inventory estimate for 2014 16 where available (Russia 0.6 Gg yr -1 , China 7.3 Gg yr -1 , India 2.8 Gg yr -1 , Japan 0.6 Gg yr -1 , South Korea 0.2 Gg yr -1 ), or else they were taken to be 0.05 Gg yr -1 , with the emissions distributed uniformly over land within each country.

These were given large uncertainties resulting in estimates of total emissions of 23 (0-147) Gg yr -1 for China, 2.6 (0-26) Gg yr -1 for eastern mainland China, and 1.2 (0-8.6), 0.3 (0-3.4) and 0.4 (0-3.9) Gg yr -1 for western Japan (using a previous definition of western Japan 4 ), South Korea and North Korea, respectively, for CFC-11 and CFC-12. For CCl4, the a priori estimates were 14 (0-90) Gg yr -1 for China, 1.6 (0-16) Gg yr -1 for eastern mainland China, and 0.7 (0-5), 0.2 (0-2) and 0.2 (0-2.3) Gg yr -1 respectively for western Japan, South Korea and North Korea. A priori emissions over water were set to zero and assigned a smaller prior uncertainty relative to emissions on land. The methodology of the NAME-InTEM model has been previously reported 4 , however there have been adjustments to some of the modelling parameters which have resulted in changes to the estimated NAME-InTEM CFC-11 compared to our previous study. The observations were averaged into 6 h inversion windows and the observational uncertainty was time varying and estimated as the variability of the observations in the 12 h period centred on the inversion window plus the measurement repeatability determined from repeat measurements of the on-site air tank. Model uncertainty was estimated every 6 h as the larger of the median of all pollution events at each station in a year or 10% of the magnitude of the pollution event. A temporal correlation of 12 h was assumed in the model uncertainty at each station.

The values derived from the multi-inversion mean are consistent with those of the individual inversions. Therefore, we use the multi-inversion mean in the main text.

A relatively high overall fugitive release rate of CCl4 of 8 -49% (due to CCl4 production, transport and CFC-11 production) is implied.

A relatively high overall fugitive release rate of CCl4 of 8 -49% (due to CCl4 production, transport and CFC-11 production) is implied. The higher end of this range seems unlikely and could be indicative of a coincident change of some other process relating to CCl4 emissions 38 , potentially including the production of chloroform (CHCl3), which increased between 2010 and 2015 32 . Using the likely production and usage scenario, co-production of CFC-12 is constrained to 0 -15%, with a fugitive CCl4 release rate of 5.8 -26.9%.</p>
        <p>We define "integrated excess" CFC-11 emissions as the cumulative total emissions above those that originated only from the inferred pre-2013 bank. Therefore, our integrated excess emissions include any CFC-11 that was released promptly during production and usage and any that was added to the bank and subsequently emitted between 2013 and 2018.We define "integrated excess" CFC-11 emissions as the cumulative total emissions above those that originated only from the inferred pre-2013 bank.

        <p>It was assumed that, without the new CFC-11 production, the emissions of CFC-12 and CCl4 would have followed a linear trend between 2012 and 2019 and the 2019 emissions were not influenced by any additional contribution to the CFC-12 or CCl4 bank. Integrated excess emissions can therefore be approximated as the sum of annual emissions above a trend line fitted between the 2012 and 2019 emissions.It was assumed that, without the new CFC-11 production, the emissions of CFC-12 and CCl4 would have followed a linear trend between 2012 and 2019 and the 2019 emissions were not influenced by any additional contribution to the CFC-12 or CCl4 bank.

        <p>A Monte Carlo uncertainty estimate used an ensemble of emissions estimates, where a normally distributed random number was added to the emissions in each year, with a standard deviation equal to the multiinversion uncertainty. For each ensemble member, the trend and excess emissions were calculated. Values presented in the main text are the mean and standard deviation of 100,000 ensemble members. Emissions for CFC-12 and CCl4 relied on data from Gosan only, whereas CFC-11 estimates were inferred from Gosan and Hateruma data together. Therefore, it is possible that integrated excess emission estimates could be somewhat different for CCl4 and CFC-12, if Hateruma data were available, although whether they would be higher or lower will likely be dependent on the relative spatial distributions of the emissions for these species.A Monte Carlo uncertainty estimate used an ensemble of emissions estimates, where a normally distributed random number was added to the emissions in each year, with a standard deviation equal to the multiinversion uncertainty.

        <p>The global warming potentials on 100-year time horizon (GWP100) of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 were 5160, 10300 and 2100 respectively 39 , which equates to 362 (247-479) Tg CO2 using no assumptions about production and usage, or 343 (231-457) Tg CO2 for the most likely case. The ozone depletion potentials were 1, 0.77 and 0.89 for CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 respectively, where the ozone depletion potential for CFC-12 was assumed to be the mean of the range presented in the literature 39 . Using a linear relationship between CFC-11 emissions and stratospheric ozone loss 8 , the total impact on stratospheric ozone was estimated by converting the derived excess emissions for all gases into a CFC-11-equivalent total. The cumulative emissions from eastern China alone -71 (52-90) Gg CFC-11-equivalent in terms of the impact on stratospheric ozone using no production nor usage assumptions -would account for a reduction over the coming decades in global column ozone, or spring-time Antarctic ozone, of only around 0.007% or 0.07%, respectively. The same ozone reduction would be observed using the most likely production case. If we assume that all of the inferred CFC-11 production within eastern China will ultimately be released to the atmosphere, and including the temporary excess emissions of CCl4 and CFC-12, total associated ozone loss under no production and usage assumptions (or the most likely production case) would be between 0.006 -The global warming potentials on 100-year time horizon (GWP100) of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 were 5160, 10300 and 2100 respectively 39 , which equates to 362 (247-479) Tg CO2 using no assumptions about production and usage, or 343 (231-457) Tg CO2 for the most likely case.
