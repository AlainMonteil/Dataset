        <p>Coastal wetlands provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, including protecting coastal communities from storms. We estimated for the first time the global value of these storm protection services for all coastal wetlands for both damages avoided and lives saved. We used the historical tracks of 1,014 tropical cyclones since 1902 that recorded property damage and/or human casualties in 71 countries/regions. We used Bayesian and OLS statistical techniques to relate storm damages and lives lost to: wind speed, storm forward speed, the year of the storm, the volume of ocean water proximal to landfall, and GDP, population, and coastal wetlands in the swath of the storm. Based on current storm probabilities, we estimate the median annual global value of coastal wetlands for storm protection at $447 billion/yr (2015$US) ($213 -$837 billion/yr, 90% CI) and 4,620 lives saved per year (3,320 -6,550, 90% CI). The 40 million hectares of coastal wetlands in storm prone areas provided an average of $11,000/ha/yr in avoided storm damages. The frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones has been increasing in recent decades and is projected to further increase with climate change. Consequently, the already significant benefits from protecting and restoring coastal wetlands will become increasingly important and valuable in the future. These results justify much larger investments in conservation and restoration of coastal wetlands.Coastal wetlands provide a range of valuable ecosystem services, including protecting coastal communities from storms.

        <p>Coastal wetlands provide a large assortment of ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 2014;de Groot et al., 2012;Finlayson et al., 2015). One particularly vital service is the protection of both lives and property from the impacts of tropical cyclones (Rahman et al., 2018). Coastal wetlands reduce the damaging effects of tropical cyclones on coastal communities by absorbing storm energy in ways that neither solid land nor open water can (Simpson and Riehl, 1981). The mechanisms involved include decreasing the area of open water (fetch) for wind to form waves, increasing drag on water motion and hence the amplitude of a storm surge, reducing direct wind effect on the water surface, and directly absorbing wave energy (Boesch et al., 2006;Costanza et al., 2006). Wetland vegetation contributes in two ways: (1) by decreasing surges and waves; and (2) by maintaining shallow water depths that have the same effect. Wetlands also reduce flood damages by absorbing flood waters caused by rain and moderating their effects on built-up areas.Coastal wetlands provide a large assortment of ecosystem services (Costanza et al., 2014;de Groot et al., 2012;Finlayson et al., 2015).

        <p>Relatively few previous studies have addressed the ecosystem service value of storm protection provided by coastal wetlands. Some have focused on a particular type of wetland, (e.g. mangrove forests), on specific storms, or for specific regions (Badola and Hussain, 2005;Barbier, 2007;Barbier and Enchelmeyer, 2014;Barbier et al., 2013;Boutwell and Westra, 2016;Danielsen et al., 2005;Das and Vincent, 2009;Farber, 1987). A few have addressed the national scale using statistical analysis of historical storms for the US (Costanza et al., 2008;Sun and Carson, 2020), Mexico (Pérez-Maqueo et al., 2018), China (Liu et al., 2019;Ouyang et al., 2018), and Australia (Mulder et al., 2020). Costanza et al. (2008) analysed the storm damages from 34 major hurricanes avoided by coastal wetlands in the United States. They estimated an average value of more than $US 8000/ha/yr and a total value for the US Atlantic and Gulf coast wetlands of more than $US 23 billion/ yr (in 2007US$). Value in this case is estimated as the dollar value of the damages avoided by having the coastal wetlands in place. Using methods similar to Costanza et al., Ouyang et al. (2018) estimated the value of coastal wetlands in Australia and China at $US 53 and 199 billion/yr.Relatively few previous studies have addressed the ecosystem service value of storm protection provided by coastal wetlands.

        <p>More recently, Sun and Carson (2020), using a different functional form and improved data, analysed property damage caused by 88 tropical storms hitting the US from 1996 to 2016. They estimated an average value of $1.8 million/km 2 /yr ($18,000/ha/yr).More recently, Sun and Carson (2020), using a different functional form and improved data, analysed property damage caused by 88 tropical storms hitting the US from 1996 to 2016.

        <p>These studies used statistical analysis of the relationships between storm damages, wetlands, and storm characteristics. A different approach uses process based hydrological modelling of storm impacts on flooding and flood damages. Recent examples at the global scale estimate the flood protection value provided by coral reefs (Beck et al., 2018) and mangroves (Menéndez et al., 2020).

        <p>To determine the storm protection value of coastal wetlands, we developed models that predict the property damage and lives lost caused by tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones are grouped into categories. Tropical storms are cyclones with wind speeds between 34 and 63 knots (sometimes called category 0). Storms with wind speeds&gt;64 knots are classified as hurricanes (or typhons) ranging in category on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale from 1 to 5, with wind speeds ranging from 64 to 82, 83-95, 96-112, 113-136, and &gt; 137 knots respectively. Property damage and lives lost are based on the spatial and physical characteristics of the storms themselves and the social, economic, and environmental characteristics of the land and water in the swath of the storm.To determine the storm protection value of coastal wetlands, we developed models that predict the property damage and lives lost caused by tropical cyclones.

        <p>To do this, we needed to assemble data on three basic elements: (1) storm tracks and characteristics; (2) wetland area, GDP (as a proxy for infrastructure), and population in each storm's swath; and (3) storm damages and human lives lost in each storm's swath. We describe details of how we assembled this data and how we used it to model the relationships between these variables in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

The US was the focus for the Costanza et al. study because sufficient data was not available for other countries/regions to carry out the analysis. In the intervening years, similar studies showing the role of wetlands in reducing storm damages have been carried out in Mexico (Pérez-Maqueo et al., 2018), China (Liu et al., 2019;Ouyang et al., 2018), and Australia (Mulder et al., 2020).In general, we used methods similar to those used in Costanza et al.

This estimate of this parameter is consistent with estimates in previous studies and estimates using a subset of this dataset and standard OLS methods (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). Table 2 shows the range of these estimates. The resulting values of coastal wetlands for storm protection are also consistent with these previous studies, as we show further on. Here we expand the analysis to a longer term, global perspective, use Bayesian analysis techniques to better handle data uncertainty while estimating the value of coastal wetland for both preventing property damages and saving lives.These parameter estimates indicate that coastal wetlands have very significant effects on reducing damages from tropical storms: β 1 = -0.236.

        <p>Windspeed is the most obvious contributor to damages and has a significant positive effect (β 2 = 3.298). This value is consistent with the well-known relationship that the power in wind increases as the cube of windspeed. Storm forward speed has a significant negative effect on damages (β 4 = -0.55) since slower moving storms have more time to cause damages from rainfall. The volume of water in the ocean proximal to landfall has a significant positive effect on damages (β 5 = 0.137) since more water in the coastal ocean proximal to landfall provides more water for storm surges and more thermal energy to support the storm.Windspeed is the most obvious contributor to damages and has a significant positive effect (β 2 = 3.298).

        <p>Finally, we show that time (year -1900) has a significant negative effect on damages (β 3 = -0.058). This is because technology is improving for tracking and monitoring storms and assessing damages, and building codes are improving the ability of built infrastructure to resist damages. As far as we are aware, this identification of a time trend that captures a We had initially included the area of coral reefs in the storm swath as an additional explanatory variable, but found that it was not statistically significant. This is most likely due to the complexity of the interactions between coral reefs and tropical cyclones, including peak wave height during the storm compared to ambient wave height, distance of the reefs from the coast, height of reef, continuity of reefs, tidal conditions etc. (Roeber and Bricker, 2015) These factors were inadequately captured by the global statistical datasets available to us. However, Beck et al. (2018), using a very different, process based, hydrodynamic approach were able to estimate the flood protection benefits provided by global coral reefs. They estimated these services at about $3 billion/yr for 30 countries. However, Australia, with one of the largest coral reefs in the world, was not included in that study. This is because coral reefs in shallow water close to populated coasts provided the largest flood protection and the Great Barrier Reef is far offshore and not proximal to large population centres.Finally, we show that time (year -1900) has a significant negative effect on damages (β 3 = -0.058).

        <p>As Fig. 5 shows, there is still significant unexplained variation in the results. The effects of tropical cyclones on property damages are complex. However, our Bayesian R 2 of 0.49 shows our model captures a large portion of the variability in damages globally using data across 61 countries/regions and over 75 years. Our results clearly indicate and quantify the major effects that coastal wetlands have on moderating damage from tropical cyclones. Next, we estimated in a similar way deaths/population using Equation (1) as a log-log function of wind speed of the storm (windspeed), forward speed of the storm (speed), wetland area in the swath of the storm (wetlands), volume of water in the ocean proximal to the landfall (volume) and a linear function of year of the storm -1900 (time). Results for these parameters are given in Fig. 6 and Table 3. For this analysis we used the entire dataset back to 1902, since earlier storms were much more likely to report deaths accurately than damages and many storms with missing damage data did report deaths. This left us with 936 storms that reported deaths.As Fig. 5 shows, there is still significant unexplained variation in the results. The effects of tropical cyclones on property damages are complex.

        <p>We see similar results for our model in estimating the deaths from tropical cyclones as we did for estimating property damages. The influence of wetlands is again very significant (Table 3) in avoiding deaths and the other variables have similar influences. As far as we know, this is the first quantitative estimate of the relative influence of coastal wetlands on lives lost from tropical cyclones. Our results clearly indicate that coastal wetlands have a major influence on saving lives.We see similar results for our model in estimating the deaths from tropical cyclones as we did for estimating property damages.

        <p>To do this, we needed to know the probabilities of particular locations being hit by a tropical cyclone of a given magnitude in a typical year. We estimated this probability based on historical storm frequency by storm category striking 100 × 100 km pixels (Fig. 3). We then applied equations 4a-c in Supplementary Materials and Methods to each 100 × 100 km pixel globally to produce maps of the value of coastal wetlands for storm protection in terms of both avoided property damages (Fig. 8) and lives saved (Fig. 9).To do this, we needed to know the probabilities of particular locations being hit by a tropical cyclone of a given magnitude in a typical year.

Fig. 10 is a probability density plot for this estimate, with a median value of $447 billion/yr (2015$US), a mean of $475 billion/yr and a 90% centralized credibility interval (from the joint posterior distribution) of $213-$837 billion/yr For global lives saved, this resulted in the probability density plot shown in Fig. 11, with a median value of 4620 lives saved, a mean of 4720 lives saved, and a 90% centralized credibility interval (from the joint posterior distribution) of 3230-6550 lives saved.Summing over all pixels with a chance of being hit by a tropical cyclone yielded an estimate of global avoided damages.

        <p>We then summed these values for each of the 71 countries/regions hit by tropical storms. Table 4 shows the number of tropical cyclones, total historical damages and lives lost due to tropical cyclones, and the annual estimated avoided damages and lives saved by coastal wetlands for each country/region. Note that the distribution of storm protection across countries/regions is quite variable, and is dependent on storm probability, GDP in storm prone areas, coastal wetlands in storm prone areas, and coastal bathymetry. The top five countries in terms of annual avoided damages (all in 2015$US) are United States ($200 billion), China ($157 billion), Philippines ($47 billion), Japan ($24 billion), and Mexico ($15 billion). In terms of annual lives saved, the top five are China (1309), Philippines (976), United States (469), India (414), and Bangladesh (360).We then summed these values for each of the 71 countries/regions hit by tropical storms.

        <p>These results are a significant expansion and improvement over previous estimates of the value of coastal wetlands for storm protection. Our analysis maps the global distribution of these benefits. The summaries by country/region can help guide policy decisions about coastal wetland conservation and restoration.These results are a significant expansion and improvement over previous estimates of the value of coastal wetlands for storm protection.

        <p>Table 5 summarizes the results from some previous studies for comparison. Most are statistical analyses limited to single countries/ regions using much smaller sample sizes. For example, Farber (1987) looked at a subnational region (Louisiana) and specific damages (wind) from a small number of storms. Later studies employed larger sample sizes and better data on damages, wetland area, and storm characteristics. Our estimates are based on a much larger global sample, but they are consistent with the other studies. For example, Sun and Carson (2020) produced an average estimate of $US 18,000/ha/yr for the US, a bit larger than our global average of $US11,000/ha/yr. One might have expected the difference to be even larger as the average GDP/capita in the US is higher than the majority of countries impacted by tropical cyclones. But our total value for the US of $US 200 billion/yr (Table 4) is consistent with the results from Sun and Carson (2020) and damages from tropical cyclones are not directly related to national GDP/capita. Menéndez et al. (2020) estimated the global value of mangrove forests for flood protection using a totally different, process-based hydrodynamic approach. Their approach provides some of the underlying causality for the statistical results we observe, and their value estimates for avoided flooding damages provided by mangrove forests are consistent with what we observe. Our statistical analysis includes all coastal wetlands (not just mangroves) and includes all damages from the storms (not just flood damages).Table 5 summarizes the results from some previous studies for comparison.

        <p>All of the studies mentioned are spatially explicit and show a broad range of values depending on the local infrastructure at risk, wetland area in the swath, building codes that affect damages, the probability of Ours is the first estimate globally and for all countries/regions affected by tropical cyclones of the value of all coastal wetlands for avoiding all tropical cyclone damages and the first estimate of the global value of wetlands for avoiding lives lost from tropical cyclones.All of the studies mentioned are spatially explicit and show a broad range of values depending on the local infrastructure at risk, wetland area in the swath, building codes that affect damages, the probability of Ours is the first estimate globally and for all countries/regions affected by tropical cyclones of the value of all coastal wetlands for avoiding all tropical cyclone damages and the first estimate of the global value of wetlands for avoiding lives lost from tropical cyclones.</p>
        <p>Globally, tropical cyclone intensity has been increasing in recent decades due to an increase in tropical cyclone potential caused by an increase in ocean surface temperatures. (Emanuel, 2020;Kossin et al., 2020). For example, the number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin alone in 2020 was a new record of 30 named storms, with 7 registering winds of 100 knots or more. These trends are consistent with Vecchi et al. ( 2013) and Smith et al. ( 2010) who show increasing frequency over time in the Atlantic basin. Other studies show that while major tropical cyclones (categories 4-5) are becoming increasingly frequent (Emanuel, 2020;Klotzbach and Landsea, 2015;Kossin et al., 2020) hurricane categories 1-3 appear to have remained relatively constant. Klotzbach et al. (2018) found that the number of landfalls in the US has not been increasing over the period 1900 to 2015, even though damages increased dramatically. However Weinkle et al. (2018) did not find any clear trends in hurricane damages for the US.Globally, tropical cyclone intensity has been increasing in recent decades due to an increase in tropical cyclone potential caused by an increase in ocean surface temperatures.

        <p>Most of these studies were limited to the Atlantic basin or the US. Fig. 12 shows the global trends for tropical cyclones included in IBTrACS v3 (https://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00834 ) for (1) all tropical cyclones; and (2) for those that have recorded damages or deaths in EM-DAT and were included in our database. These plots show a clear change in the trends post 1940, due, we believe, to better reporting after that date, especially for damages. This is why we only used the post 1940 tropical cyclones that recorded damages from EM-DAT for our damages model. If pre 1940 storms are excluded, the R 2 for the trend line increases from 0.77 to 0.83.Most of these studies were limited to the Atlantic basin or the US.

        <p>While not all basins show increasing tropical cyclone frequency, recent global trends are clear. Climate change will continue to exacerbate these trends and will make the value of coastal wetlands for storm protection and their other ecosystem services even greater. This is also becoming increasingly relevant as 700 million people (approximately 10% of the human population) currently live at &lt;10 m above sea level on an area that is 2% of the land surface (McGranahan et al., 2007). The increasing vulnerability of aging coastal built infrastructure in the face of climate change also highlights the need to protect and restore coastal wetlands.While not all basins show increasing tropical cyclone frequency, recent global trends are clear.

        <p>Coastal wetlands provide 'horizontal levees' that are maintained by nature and are far more cost-effective than constructed levees or seawalls (Liu et al., 2019). Coastal wetlands also provide a host of other valuable ecosystem services that constructed levees do not. They have been estimated to provide about $US 135,000/ha/yr of other ecosystem services over and above storm protection (Costanza et al., 2014). Experience (including the current study) has shown that as we better understand the functioning of ecological systems and their connections to human wellbeing, estimates of their values tend to increase. At the same time land use change, including the loss of coastal wetlands, is reducing the extent and total value of the ecosystem services they are able to provide (Costanza et al., 2014). It has been estimated that since 1900 the world has lost over 50% of wetlands (Davidson, 2014). Reversing these trends and investing in the maintenance and restoration of coastal wetlands is an extremely cost-effective strategy for society and can significantly increase sustainable wellbeing for humans and the rest of nature (Kubiszewski et al., 2017).Coastal wetlands provide 'horizontal levees' that are maintained by nature and are far more cost-effective than constructed levees or seawalls (Liu et al., 2019).

        <p>• As noted, the interaction between tropical storms and coastal wetlands is complex. Our analysis does not attempt to model the biophysical dynamics of this interaction, as some other recent studies have done (Beck et al., 2018;Menéndez et al., 2020). We are only looking at statistical relationships between the variables for which we were able to collect sufficient data globally. For example, the relative position of infrastructure and population relative to the storm swath and direction is not used in the analysisonly the aggregate area of wetlands, infrastructure, and total population in the swath. Thus we are demonstrating statistical, not deterministic or causal relationships. It is interesting, however, that these different approaches give similar results as to the value of coastal wetlands for storm protection, leading to more confidence in the results of both. • Global data on land cover, GDP, storm tracks, wind speed and storm speed, property damages, and lives lost are all uncertain in different ways. Combining these data introduces additional uncertainty. Our Bayesian approach is better able to deal with this data uncertainty and give us better estimates of the range of uncertainty in the results, but better data would obviously help and we had to make several assumptions in order to complete the analysis. For example, we backcast GDP in the swath based on GDP in the swath in 2015 (for which we have reasonably accurate data) and the ratio of GDP in the country/region in 2015 to GDP in the country/region in the year of the storm (for which we also have reasonably accurate data from a different source). But this ignores differential GDP growth rates in different parts of countries/regions. Likewise, we used global coastal wetland area data from the ESA CCI land cover time series, but this series showed negligible change in wetland area from 1980 to present, even though we know that coastal wetlands have declined in many areas over that time period. We ran some sensitivity analyses to see what difference this makes to our results (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). It turned out to be negligible, but obviously we would like to have better global wetland area data over time. In addition, damage data is quite unreliable in its coverage for tropical cyclones in the first half of the 20th century, especially for smaller losses prior to 1980. We limited our damage model to post-1944 storms for this reason. • Another issue is the shape and size of the swath we used. We compared two different ways of doing this (see Supplementary Materials and Methods) and noted that they gave similar results, but each of these (or any other method we might have chosen) represents an assumption on our part about the area over which the storm has its major impacts. The fact that our two different methods had similar results implies that our analysis is relatively robust to this assumption.• As noted, the interaction between tropical storms and coastal wetlands is complex.
