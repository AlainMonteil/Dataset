        <p>We investigate the gravitational lensing by spinning Proca stars and the shadows and lensing by Kerr black holes (BHs) with synchronised Proca hair, discussing both theoretical aspects and observational constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) M87* and Sgr A* data. On the theoretical side, this family of BHs interpolates between Kerr-like solutionsexhibiting a similar optical appearance to that of Kerr BHs -to very non-Kerr like solutions, exhibiting exotic features such as cuspy shadows, egg-like shadows and ghost shadows. We interpret these features in terms of the structure of the fundamental photon orbits, for which different branches exist, containing both stable and unstable orbits, with some of the latter not being shadow related. On the observational side, we show that current EHT constraints are compatible with all such BHs that could form from the growth of the superradiant instability of Kerr BHs. Unexpectedly, given the (roughly) 10% error bars in the EHT data -and in contrast to their scalar cousin model -, some of the BHs with up to 40% of their energy in their Proca hair are compatible with the current data. We estimate the necessary resolution of future observations to better constrain this model.We investigate the gravitational lensing by spinning Proca stars and the shadows and lensing by Kerr black holes (BHs) with synchronised Proca hair, discussing both theoretical aspects and observational constraints from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) M87* and Sgr A* data.

        <p>The present golden age of observational strong gravity invites us to test the Kerr hypothesis and, in particular, its universality [1]. It is therefore timely to consider well motivated non-Kerr models and compare their phenomenology with the current data. In parallel, considering non-Kerr models is a valuable theoretical arena, often enlightening in understanding how generic or special the General Relativity (GR) (electro-)vacuum black holes (BHs) are, since much of our intuition about the physics of BHs is constructed upon them.The present golden age of observational strong gravity invites us to test the Kerr hypothesis and, in particular, its universality [1].

        <p>For either of these -i.e. observational or theoretical -perspectives, light is a privileged probe.

The deeper understanding of BHs that emerged in the 1960s, in particular the discovery of the Kerr metric [5], led to the first (academic) discussions on the optical appearance of BHs [6]. It was understood that such optical appearance is intimately connected to the bound orbits of light around BHs.

        <p>These academic studies were accompanied by more astrophysical investigations on the optical appearence of BHs, most notably the tour de force image of a Schwarzschild BH surrounded by an accretion disk, by Luminet [10]. At the turn of the last century Falcke et al. proposed that the optical appearence the supermassive BH at our galactic centre could actually be resolved, to produce its "photography", observing in particular its silhouette or shadow [11]. This remarkable proposal led to a worldwide collaborative effort -the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) -that in 2019 [12][13][14] and 2022 [15][16][17][18] published the first images of the M87* and Sgr A* supermassive BHs, respectively.These academic studies were accompanied by more astrophysical investigations on the optical appearence of BHs, most notably the tour de force image of a Schwarzschild BH surrounded by an accretion disk, by Luminet [10].

        <p>BH imaging is still in its infancy, and the future promises to deliver higher accurate results with the next generation EHT observatories. It is therefore timely to study how much these observations can distinguish well motivated models of non-Kerr BHs, emerging as solutions of sound physical theories, without known pathologies and with a plausible formation mechanism. Such conditions are quite restrictive, but they can be met even in GR with simple matter contents obeying the most fundamental energy conditions. This is the case of Kerr BHs with (synchronised) Proca Hair (KBHsPH) [19,20] that are solution of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to a free, complex Proca field (cf. action (2.1) below). These BHs circumvent no-Proca hair theorems [21] by virtue of a harmonic time dependence of the bosonic field [19]. The model is free of known pathologies, and the hairy BHs could emerge dynamically via the superradiant instability of Kerr [22], triggered by the bosonic field [23][24][25]. This family of hairy BHs interpolates between the bald Kerr solution and horizonless self-gravitating solitons known as Proca stars (PSs) [26]. Spinning PSs, unlike their scalar cousins -boson stars (BSs) -have been shown to be dynamically robust [27], lending further dynamical credibility to the model -see also [28]. These PSs, moreover, have been recently advocated to match gravitational wave data [29,30], further motivating the model from a phenomenological viewpoint. Finally, even in the spherical case, PSs exhibit qualitatively distinct features from their scalar cousins, and have been shown to be able to imitate imaging observations under some conditions [31] (see also [32]).BH imaging is still in its infancy, and the future promises to deliver higher accurate results with the next generation EHT observatories.

        <p>The goal of this paper is study the lensing, shadows of KBHsPH from both a theoretical and observational viewpoint. This study parallels previous studies for Kerr BHs with (synchronised) scalar hair [9,[33][34][35][36], and some of our findings are qualitatively similar to the scalar case; others, however, are different. We observe, for instance, that the shadows of these Proca hairy BHs can vary from Kerr-like to very non-Kerr like, as one scans the domain of existence of solutions. When the latter occur, qualitatively distinct features emerge, such as cuspy shadows, egg-like shadows and ghost shadows. We shall interpret these features considering the study of the FPOs of the corresponding solutions. One of the most unexpected aspects of our study emerges when considering the comparison with EHT data. As we shall show below, KBHsPH can be compatible with the current EHT observations for much hairier solutions than in the scalar case. We shall put forward a speculation to why this is the case in the discussion section.The goal of this paper is study the lensing, shadows of KBHsPH from both a theoretical and observational viewpoint.

        <p>Synthetic lensing images were generated by evolving numerically 1024 × 1024 light ray trajectories from O's location, using a backwards ray-tracing method [34,39]. The observation angles seen by O (in its frame) determine the initial conditions for the light ray propagation. The observer's field of view always spans 35 • across both horizontal and vertical directions in all the lensing images presented in this paper. The image information is then presented in image coordinates (x, y), obtained by multiplying the observation angles by the circumferential radius of the observer (defined below). This scaling procedure removes the typical fall-off behaviour of the angular size of objects at very large distances -see [34] for more details.Synthetic lensing images were generated by evolving numerically 1024 × 1024 light ray trajectories from O's location, using a backwards ray-tracing method [34,39].

        <p>It is helpful to start with a discussion on the lensing due to PSs (see figure 345). To gain insight on the gravitational effects of the PSs, it is pedagogical to follow a sequence of solutions with increasingly stronger gravitational effects. Thus, we start from the PS solution 1.0, with ω 1.0 = 0.99, which is the closest one to vacuum (for which ω = 1), 3 and we then move along red spiral in the space of solutions, see figure 1.It is helpful to start with a discussion on the lensing due to PSs (see figure 345).

        <p>For solution 1.0 we find no noticeable distortion on the background -figure 3 (top left panel) -when compared with the flat-spacetime reference image in figure 2. By moving to solutions 2.0 and 3.0 the (still very weak) lensing distortion only increases mildly -see figure 3 (top middle panel). Then, a new qualitative feature arises for solution 4.0 with ω 4.0 ER1 = 0.90: the appearance of the first Einstein ring, as the white spot at F opens up and encloses two inverted copies of regions of the sky belonging to two of the quadrants of the celestial sphere -see figure 3 (top right panel).For solution 1.0 we find no noticeable distortion on the background -figure 3 (top left panel) -when compared with the flat-spacetime reference image in figure 2.

        <p>As we move further along the spiral to solution 5.0, the Einstein ring takes a more elliptical shape and copies of all four quadrants can now be seen inside the ring -figure 3 (bottom left panel). Similarly to rotating scalar BSs [33], the side rotating away from O JCAP01(2023)047 appears more amplified, and F is progressively shifted to one side. As we move even further along the PS spiral to solution 7.0 and ω 7.0 ER2 = 0.75, then we find the emergence of a second Einstein ring -see figure 3 (bottom right panel). Likewise to rotating BSs, these new rings also have a squashed "D-shape".As we move further along the spiral to solution 5.0, the Einstein ring takes a more elliptical shape and copies of all four quadrants can now be seen inside the ring -figure 3 (bottom left panel).

        <p>The first appearance of a light ring marks the transition from the compact to the ultracompact regime [55]. This light ring appearance is observed (in our selection of solutions) for the PS solution 8.0, with ω 8.0 LR1 = 0.70, cf. figure 4 (top left panel); then an infinite number of copies -and a self similar structure -is expected to arise [39].The first appearance of a light ring marks the transition from the compact to the ultracompact regime [55].

        <p>Finally, in table 1 we summarize some key features of the PSs data set by indicating the frequency (in units of µ) of the solution at which they first appear. 4 For comparison, we also present the same information but for the rotating BSs case [33]. We observe that the emergence of the first light ring precedes that of an ergo-region, which is first spotted at ω 0.602. This is generic feature: it was recently proved that any stationary, axisymmetric JCAP01(2023)047 (bottom) ω 11.0,12.0,13.0 = 0.55; 0.50; 0.47. Note that the lensing images of solutions with ω 12.0,13.0 show a few pink colored pixels.

        <p>The fact that ultracompact spinning PSs do not feature an ergo-region is useful in isolating imprints of the light ring instability from those of ergo-region sourced instabilitiessee e.g., [58]. The light ring instability has been suggested to be associated with the presence of stable light rings in the spacetime [55,59,60], and ultracompact PSs necessarily have both a stable and an unstable LR [60]. For the case of PSs this instability was recently shown to lead to a migration of the ultracompact PSs to non-ultracompact ones [56].The fact that ultracompact spinning PSs do not feature an ergo-region is useful in isolating imprints of the light ring instability from those of ergo-region sourced instabilitiessee e.g., [58].

        <p>Similarly to the scalar case, KBHsPH have Kerr-like shadows near the existence line (whence they bifurcate from Kerr solutions) for the same mass, angular momentum and comparable observation conditions. This is the case for instance of solution 3.4 -figure 6 (top left panel). Considering then the sequence of solutions 3.v (with v ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}), one observes a monotonically decreasing shadow size as v also decreases -see figure 6 (top panels, from left to right). The decreasing shadow size seems a natural consequence of the correspondingly smaller fraction of the horizon mass to the ADM mass. We remark that the sequence of KBHsPH solutions 3.v bifurcate from the PS solution 3.0, with frequency ω 3.0 = 0.95.Similarly to the scalar case, KBHsPH have Kerr-like shadows near the existence line (whence they bifurcate from Kerr solutions) for the same mass, angular momentum and comparable observation conditions.

        <p>Kerr BHs possess two light rings with opposite rotation senses, both of them unstable: one for a negative impact parameter, η LR -, and another for a positive one, η LR + . A continuum family of SPOs exists between the two light rings, with η LR η η LR + , all of them related to one or more points of the shadow edge (see [9]). We represent in figure 10 the SPO family for an extremal Kerr BH in terms of the impact parameter η and the corresponding Boyer-Lindquist radius coordinate r.

        <p>It is not unexpected that there exists a subset of hairy BH solutions whose FPO family structure does not differ very much from the Kerr case. above, in terms of the lensing, this is the case for solutions with frequencies down to ω 7.v = 0.75.

Although the solution studied in [9] corresponds to a different family of hairy BHs solutions, 6 we verified that the same interpretation of the shadow cusp also applies here, as we shall now discuss, reinforcing the idea that FPOs are a useful non-trivial tool when it comes to understanding non-Kerr features present in shadows and lensing images.Cuspy shadow.

        <p>In figure 11 we present the FPO family diagram for solution 8.3, where it is clear that there are two distinct and discontinuous branches of unstable FPOs that are shadow related -the red and yellow solid lines. The red line is dubbed the lower branch, occurring for larger (albeit some still negative) impact parameters, whereas the yellow line is dubbed the upper branch, occurring for smaller (and all negative) impact parameters. These two branches actually connect to each other via some other FPOs that are not shadow related, some being stable and others unstable. Each branch of the shadow related FPOs terminates at a light ring, on one end, and at a particular FPO, on the other end. The impact parameter of the latter is the same for both branches, which allows the shadow edge to be continuous, but not smooth (as a curve). This explains the cusp seen in the shadow edge of solution 8.3, which is displayed in figure 12 together with an illustration of how each shadow point is mapped to a corresponding FPO branch. Curiously, solution 8.3 is also fairly close in the domain of existence of KBHsPH to solution 8.2, which has two additional light rings (one stable and the other unstable) with respect to 8.3 -see figure 1. This realization, together with an examination on how extra light rings might emerge by deforming the FPO family diagram (see also the discussion of the next section), leads to the conjecture that the presence of a cuspy shadow could signal the near-emergence of a second pair of light rings in the space of solutions.

        <p>This upper branch can be divided into three different sub-branches: a stable 7 and unstable O 1+ 0 type orbits and a stable O 0+ 0 type one. Orbits of type O 0+ 0 discussed here are restricted to the equatorial plane and, thus, there are several available options when it comes to labelling these orbits with a single coordinate r value. In this paper, the radial value used to represent type O 0+ 0 orbits corresponds to the JCAP01(2023)047 mean radial value, defined as the average of the maximum and minimum r values reached along the geodesic motion. By labelling these FPOs in such a manner, the O 0+ 0 branch upper end point in figure 13, i.e. with largest radius, coincides precisely with the radius at which the stable O 1+ 0 branch connects to the unstable one. In [9] the authors discussed how unstable FPOs non-related to the shadow could be associated to a set of lensing patterns attached to the shadow edge, dubbed "eyelashes". A similar feature can be seen in the lensing of 8.3 (cf. figure 7, lower left panel). After the emergence of a second pair of light rings in solution 8.2, the eyelashes appear to become disconnected from the shadow, forming a pixelated banana-shaped strip that can be seen in the lensing image -see bottom middle panel of figure 7. This feature has been dubbed "ghost shadow" in the literature [62], and it seems plausible that it is a consequence of the existence of the unstable FPO branch that is non-related to the shadow.

        <p>Shifting our attention to solution 9.3 (figure 8, top left panel), FPOs of type O 2+ 1 can also be found (cf. figure 14). These orbits were already reported to exist in PSs [9], but it was still unknown whether they could be present in KBHsPH, and how they were related to the other FPOs branches.

        <p>Fully dynamical numerical evolutions of the superradiant instability around a Kerr BH, driven by a complex vector field, were shown to form KBHsPH with p 0.1 (see [19,23,24] for details). As discussed in [64], the bound p 0.1 can be expected to hold in general regardless of the spin of the bosonic field, as long as the development of the superradiant instability from Kerr is assumed to be approximately conservative. Numerical evolutions have indeed suggested the latter to be the case, at least in the cases studied thus far [23,64]. Nevertheless, JCAP01 As in that figure, the red solid line is the PS limit and the blue dotted line is the Kerr limit. The black solid line is the extremal Kerr line.

        <p>Although it is possible to obtain numerically the shadow size of KBHsPH up to a fairly high precision, it will become useful in the following sections to work with an analytical approximation instead. Following [36], we start by expressing the Kerr areal radius as a function of the spin and of the polar angle of the observer, θ o . This can be achieved by interpolating between the two cases where the shadow area can be computed exactly: when the observer is on the rotation axis (i.e., θ o = {0, π}), and for the case of an extremal Kerr BH viewed from the equatorial plane in the far-away limit.

        <p>The main implication of this shadow analysis is that the vector (Proca) case introduces a more complex picture than that of the scalar case, described in [36]. For instance, as one can realise from figure 17, KBHsPH can in fact become better Kerr mimickers, since there are solutions whose shadow deviation from the comparable Kerr is below 10% and that possess up to 40% of the total mass stored on the Proca hair outside the horizon (i.e. p = 0.4). It is nothing short of surprising that having such a significant deviation on the spacetime geometry can still lead to small deviations on shadow size. This scenario contrasts with the scalar case, wherein a shadow deviation of 10% disfavoured solutions with p &gt; 0.1. This is a key difference that we have unveiled between the two models. We will come back to this difference and its possible cause below. According to figure 17, for a fixed M µ, the greater the value of p, the greater is the deviation δS. Thus, each value of p determines a minimum observation resolution necessary to test that KBHPH model, for a given M µ. This is clear by looking at the left panel of figure 18, where we represent δS (p, M µ) as function of M µ for fixed values of p from 0.1 to 0.29. From this plot we realise that as we increase M µ, and for a fixed p, the more challenging it becomes to distinguish a KBHsPH solution from a Kerr one.The main implication of this shadow analysis is that the vector (Proca) case introduces a more complex picture than that of the scalar case, described in [36].

Our study has been both academic, exploring the lensing and shadow features across the full domain of existence, as well as phenomenological, focusing on regions of the parameter space where the solutions are astrophysically more plausible (e.g. free of stable light rings or FPOs, that can source a spacetime instability).In this work we have considered the shadows and lensing of a non-Kerr model -KBHsPH -that is dynamically robust, in the sense that it appears in a sound physical theory with no known pathologies and it has a plausible formation mechanism, as discussed in the Introduction, at least in some regions of the parameter space.

        <p>Our study corroborates the generic expectation: since KBHsPH interpolate between the (vacuum) Kerr solution and the (horizonless) PSs, their lensing features vary from Kerr likenear the former -to very non-Kerr like -for some regions of the parameter space and for solutions with a large fraction of the hair in the Proca field. Concerning the latter, which are more exotic solutions, non-Kerr features such as cuspy, egg-like or ghost shadows emerge typically when the spacetime accommodates a more complex structure of FPOs than Kerr. As emphasised in the text above, it would be interesting to study the generality of some of the features unveiled here, such as: 1) the relation between cuspy shadows and the emergence of new pairs of light rings; or 2) the connection between ghost shadows and the existence of unstable FPOs not-related to the shadow.Our study corroborates the generic expectation: since KBHsPH interpolate between the (vacuum) Kerr solution and the (horizonless) PSs, their lensing features vary from Kerr likenear the former -to very non-Kerr like -for some regions of the parameter space and for solutions with a large fraction of the hair in the Proca field.

        <p>Furthermore, the (possibly) most intriguing result from our analysis arose when considering the comparison with observations. Let us contextualize it by recalling the analog result for Kerr BHs with synchronised scalar hair [36]. In this reference it was shown that the scalar hairy BHs were compatible with the EHT M87* measurement up to a fraction of the energy in the hair of the order of 10%. This seems an intuitive result, as this distribution of the energy between the BH and the surrounding environment seems to affect the shadow size by (roughly) 10%, which is of the order of the error in the measurement of the shadow size by the EHT JCAP01(2023)047 for M87*. Naively, one could have expected a similar result for the KBHsPH discussed here. However, we found that in some regions of the parameter space -and given sufficiently large M µ -, Proca hairy BHs with at least 29%10 of their energy in the surrounding environment (rather than in the horizon) are still compatible with the EHT measurement of both M87* and Sgr A*. Our best guess, at the moment, is that the estimation of the variation of the shadow size by the fraction of energy outside the horizon can be misleading, as the shadow is an imprint not of the horizon but rather of the FPOs structure. For reasons that should be better understood this (naive estimate) works well for the scalar hairy BHs, but less for the Proca hairy ones. Thus, it would be interesting to understand if there is a correlation between the shadow size variation and the amount of hair that can be assigned to be outside the shell of FPOs around generic spinning BHs. An investigation on this aspect is underway, and we expect to report on it in the near future.Furthermore, the (possibly) most intriguing result from our analysis arose when considering the comparison with observations.
