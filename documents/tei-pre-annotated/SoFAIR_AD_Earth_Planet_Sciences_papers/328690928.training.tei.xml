        <p>The marine environment represents a vast source of renewable energy. Energy is available in multiple forms -wind, wave, tides, currents, and temperature and pressure gradients. The successful commercial exploitation of these energy sources is perceived as a key target to be able to tackle the energy trilemma [1]: to provide secure, sustainable, and affordable energy. However, targeted installed capacities for 2050 (460 GW for offshore wind [2] and 188 GW for tidal and wave [3]) can be achieved only by lowering the cost of the energy produced, possibly through the combined extraction of more than one marine resource. In this regard, offshore wind farms and aquaculture have been proposed as suitable candidates for co-location/multiple use, in the recent past [4,5,6].The marine environment represents a vast source of renewable energy.

        <p>Of the various offshore renewable energy (ORE) systems, bottom fixed offshore wind turbines can be considered as commercially mature. On the other hand, floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) have been slowly evolving from concepts to reality [7], in recent decades. This upswing in the demand for FOWTs has been brought about by a combination of several factors -stronger and less turbulent offshore winds, reduced visual pollution and mulit-use conflicts, for instance. However, other offshore renewable energy (ORE) systems, such as wave energy converters, still need to be further developed, in order to be considered commercially competitive.Of the various offshore renewable energy (ORE) systems, bottom fixed offshore wind turbines can be considered as commercially mature.

        <p>In parallel with the energy trilemma, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that, by 2030, the demand for seafood will exceed the supply by 40 million metric tonnes [8]. With constraints limiting the possibilities for the expansion of inland and near-shore fisheries, offshore aquaculture has emerged as a viable alternative for increasing the global seafood production. Aquaculture is classified as offshore, if it takes place in the open sea, exposed to significant metocean conditions [9]. Notwithstanding the challenges posed by the open ocean, offshore farming offers several advantages -increased possibilities for expansion, reduced exposure to pollution from human sources and the potential of co-locating infrastructure with ORE systems to reduce competition for operational space [10].In parallel with the energy trilemma, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that, by 2030, the demand for seafood will exceed the supply by 40 million metric tonnes [8].

        <p>Thus, a proposed solution for a reliable energy extraction and aquaculture development, while addressing the questions of CAPEX, space limitation and operational safety could be the use of Multi-Purpose Platforms (MPPs). Ideally, an MPP is an offshore structure able to exploit the synergies between ORE systems and aquaculture systems, avoiding by design the conflicts arising from the close co-location of these systems. MPPs are expected to bring about significant cost reduction, by allowing multiple use of space and infrastructure, through co-located and shared technologies [11,12]. MPPs would also promote an optimization of the marine spatial planning, proposing an efficient, integrated, sustainable, and ecological use of oceanic resources through shared spaces and infrastructure [12,13,14].Thus, a proposed solution for a reliable energy extraction and aquaculture development, while addressing the questions of CAPEX, space limitation and operational safety could be the use of Multi-Purpose Platforms (MPPs).

        <p>Combining different ORE systems onto the same platform structure offers several benefits: increased, more consistent power production, thanks to the different patterns of different renewable energy sources, lower CAPEX-to-rated power ratio, shared balance-of-plant operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, positive dynamics interactions (e.g. wave energy converters (WECs) as additional damping systems for the OWT with which are coupled, ensuring a lower response to waves), are some of the main technological advantages.

        <p>In the STC [19], the NREL 5-MW OWT [20] is supported on a spar, and the torus (an axisymmetric point absorber that operates mainly in heave) extracts wave energy by moving along the spar, by means of a hydraulic power takeoff (PTO) system. The SFC [21] comprises a semi-submersible floater with four columns (one at the centre and three at the sides) connected by means of pontoons. The central column supports the turbine and rotating flaps hinged at the pontoons capture the wave energy, making use of a hydraulic PTO system to generate electricity.

        <p>Control systems form an integral part of any energy system. Coupling several ORE technologies and energy storage on a single MPP for aquaculture operations calls for a hybrid control system. This is due to the fact that while aquaculture requires a smooth, stable supply of power, ORE systems are highly dependent on their environmental source for power production. This can often result in periods of zero power production [60]. The existing scenario in control strategies for MPPs is reviewed in the following subsections.Control systems form an integral part of any energy system.

        <p>For an MPP combining ORE and aquaculture, while the latter can smooth the influence of waves and currents on the platform [61], it also has an impact on the layout of the power generation equipment [62]. Also, the interaction between the floating platform, wind turbine, WECs and energy storage (ES) devices, exists in many aspects such as the motion response, the dynamic loads and the control system, making the MPP a highly complex and coupled system.For an MPP combining ORE and aquaculture, while the latter can smooth the influence of waves and currents on the platform [61], it also has an impact on the layout of the power generation equipment [62].

        <p>The power supply of the MPP should be smooth and stable to meet the requirements of both the platform operations and the aquaculture system. The power transmission between land substation and the MPP also needs to be stable. As a result, power generation, ES and electrical equipment on the MPP need an overall power control and capacity management system. No comprehensive review of control technologies for MPPs currently exists. However, reviews on control of wind and wave devices [63], and control of energy storage (ES) systems [64], are useful for the present purpose.The power supply of the MPP should be smooth and stable to meet the requirements of both the platform operations and the aquaculture system.

        <p>Control systems for each ORE technology aims to operate the devices at their rated values by following an operating strategy, whilst maintaining safe operating conditions. The power generated by each technology depends on the renewable source cycle, leading to periods of zero power production. In an MPP, the combination of wind, wave and ES technologies can minimize the time of zero power production if shared control objectives are attained by means of a platform-level controller. These objectives can be classified as maximization of energy capture (wind and wave), regulation of generated power (wind, wave, ES), mitigation of structural loads for MPPs with large power capacity (wind, wave, platform), and reduction of unwanted platform swings and motions. For some types of ORE, estimation of the input can be of further benefit to the attainment of the control objectives, especially incident wave estimation for WECs [63].Control systems for each ORE technology aims to operate the devices at their rated values by following an operating strategy, whilst maintaining safe operating conditions.

        <p>The size of the MPP thus plays an important role in the definition of the control objectives. Promising wind/wave hybrid concepts estimate that the total installed capacity of around 10 -20 MW would include 20 -25% of wave energy, since energy efficiency of the WEC is much less than that of the wind turbine [65].The size of the MPP thus plays an important role in the definition of the control objectives.

        <p>The control of the electrical system is often treated separately from the control of the mechanical systems. The MPP grid is different from a conventional grid as the former depends basically on a collection of inverters and synchronous and/or asynchronous generators. Each generator will have a control system to provide voltage and frequency regulation. A power network management strategy is therefore required to provide the operating states to the local electrical control systems and also to control power sharing and achieve network stabilization.The control of the electrical system is often treated separately from the control of the mechanical systems.

        <p>The integration of island/sea area ORE power is mainly based on micro-grid technology including AC, DC and AC-DC hybrid micro-grids. The DC microgrid avoids many problems such as the loop-current between multi-inverter, protection strategies of AC grids, which conforms better to systems with source diversity and load diversity [74,75]. According to the availability of grid support, micro-grid can be divided into the grid-connected island power supply system and the remote isolated power supply system.

        <p>The micro-grid control system can be designed with different structures, i.e. the centralized control, the decentralized control and the hierarchical control. In the land-based and shore-based micro-grid demonstration projects, the centralized control is used more in Asia and the decentralized control mainly in Europe. The hierarchical model combines advantages of centralized and decentralized control, allowing better flexibility and scalability [78]. For the MPP control system, the use of hierarchical model is likely to be a better choice [79].

        <p>Several environmental impact assessment studies have been carried out on individual wind and wave energy concepts. The main concern for acoustically-sensitive species such as marine mammals to date has been the construction phase of bottom fixed OWTs due to the widespread use of pile driving, with comparatively limited focus on sounds emitted by operational OWTs, let alone floating ones [87,88,89,90]. Nonetheless, the ability of species such as harbour seals and porpoises to detect and react to the sound emitted by operational OWTs has been identified as a potential concern [91]. Marine fish and invertebrates may be similarly hampered in terms of communication masking and disturbance [92,93], although there is presently no evidence of noise emitted by operational OWTs causing physiological damage in fish [94]. Offshore WECs might present a collision risk for diving species and can potentially change local oceanographic processes by extracting large amounts of incident wave energy [95].Several environmental impact assessment studies have been carried out on individual wind and wave energy concepts.

        <p>In addition to the adverse impacts, the potential benefits of ORE systems to biodiversity have also been suggested [96]. These include the potential for ORE structures to act as secondary artificial reefs to aid in the enhancement of fisheries and rehabilitation of marine habitats [97,98,99].

As fishing around ORE installations is often prohibited, such areas can serve as miniature impromptu Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) [101].

EwE models have been successfully used to evaluate how these pressures cascade through the food-web. For example, changing in the spatial distribution of top predators (cetaceans, large fish and seabirds) will affect the entire marine ecosystem through top-down control pathways [170,152].

        <p>The emergent nature of WECs, and the lack of commercial-scale deployments, results in uncertainties surrounding their potential positive and negative socio-economic effects and impacts.

        <p>In addition to the benefit of providing a new source of electricity from a local, low carbon energy source, WEC developments will potentially bring economic benefits including the creation of jobs, the development of new supply chains and investment in infrastructure required to support such developments [194,195].In addition to the benefit of providing a new source of electricity from a local, low carbon energy source, WEC developments will potentially bring economic benefits including the creation of jobs, the development of new supply chains and investment in infrastructure required to support such developments [194,195].</p>

        <p>A further concern is that WECs may also provide non-market benefits, such as providing coastal protection benefits, they may negatively impact upon the ecosystems services and provisioning services, such as fisheries and the cultural services provided by the marine and coastal environment [194,200].

        <p>Indeed, emergent research investigating such issues has identified divergent views on the socio-economic benefits and appropriateness of wave energy development [194].

        <p>With community buy-in and support being vital to WEC deployment, there is clearly a need to maximize community benefits [194]. For example, some communities have questioned the potential benefits of WEC developments, which may result in increased electricity prices or taxes if subsidized. Thus, calls for wealth distribution and community benefit schemes, similar to those associated with other industries, have been made [194,204]. These may range from community payments, to new forms of business models, including shared or community owned schemes [194]. The embryonic nature of WECs and the lack of commercial deployments also mean that there is a paucity of empirical research investigating their real world socio-economic impacts.With community buy-in and support being vital to WEC deployment, there is clearly a need to maximize community benefits [194].

        <p>While food and jobs are the main direct socio-economic benefits from aquaculture, it has to be noted that in many Asian countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh [209,210], the fishermen community is struggling to survive with the generated income. Further, the negative effects of aquaculture have been difficult to quantify, mainly due to the lack of knowledge and awareness among the consumers [211]. The recent decades have witnessed large degradation of the coastal marine environment and its resources in many areas, at least partly due to an unprecedented growth of the aquaculture industry, coupled with the absence of proper national and international regulations, policies and management strategies [212,213].While food and jobs are the main direct socio-economic benefits from aquaculture, it has to be noted that in many Asian countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh [209,210], the fishermen community is struggling to survive with the generated income.

        <p>A ORE systems extracting energy only from one type of energy source (single purpose); B Aquaculture (only) systems; Most of the research has been focused on the technological aspects of the MPP systems, followed by the socio-economic aspects, and then the environmental impact aspects.

As it can be seen, even if it is not the only aspect, from TRL 1 to TRL 6 the focus is on the technological aspects. An important first consideration following up from this one is indeed that, despite the substantial advantages obtained if both the environmental and the socio-economic aspects are considered from the early stage of the technology development, the need to adopt a multidisciplinary approach is still not common practice even for commercially mature systems, with only few noticeable examples [11,14,57,61,226].A ORE systems extracting energy only from one type of energy source (single purpose); B Aquaculture (only) systems; Most of the research has been focused on the technological aspects of the MPP systems, followed by the socio-economic aspects, and then the environmental impact aspects.

        <p>The second consideration is that the research done on MPP has been much more focused on the so called 'hybrid' ORE systems, i.e. coupling wind, wave, and tidal systems, but considering the direct coupling or the close co-location of aquaculture systems in very few cases, especially when considering the technological aspects. The Blue Growth EU-funded projects have started to address this gap in knowledge, and MERMAID [27]), but have also highlighted the several multidisciplinary challenges to be tackled.The second consideration is that the research done on MPP has been much more focused on the so called 'hybrid' ORE systems, i.e. coupling wind, wave, and tidal systems, but considering the direct coupling or the close co-location of aquaculture systems in very few cases, especially when considering the technological aspects.

        <p>The third observation is that these European projects had been focusing on large commercial scale installations, MPP farms, consisting in installed capacities of the order of hundreds of MW to GW, connected to the grid and, whenever considered, aquaculture systems of commercial scale. Nonetheless, as demonstrated by some pilot projects in China (Daguan [221], Dawanshan [222], and Sehngshan [222]), there is a strong potential for small scale MPP to serve remote, isolated communities, providing not only a sustainable, safe, affordable source of energy, but also socio-economic benefits such as food and jobs.The third observation is that these European projects had been focusing on large commercial scale installations, MPP farms, consisting in installed capacities of the order of hundreds of MW to GW, connected to the grid and, whenever considered, aquaculture systems of commercial scale.

        <p>For example, the scale of the environmental impact is completely different, the metocean conditions will have a higher impact on the dynamic response of the MPP, and the dynamics of the different systems (wind, wave, solar, aquaculture) may be more strongly coupled.
