        <p>The recovery of long-term climate proxy records with seasonal resolution is rare because of natural smoothing processes, discontinuities and limitations in measurement resolution. Yet insolation forcing, a primary driver of multimillennialscale climate change, acts through seasonal variations with direct impacts on seasonal climate 1 . Whether the sensitivity of seasonal climate to insolation matches theoretical predictions has not been assessed over long timescales. Here, we analyse a continuous record of water-isotope ratios from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core to reveal summer and winter temperature changes through the last 11,000 years. Summer temperatures in West Antarctica increased through the early-to-mid-Holocene, reached a peak 4,100 years ago and then decreased to the present. Climate model simulations show that these variations primarily reflect changes in maximum summer insolation, confirming the general connection between seasonal insolation and warming and demonstrating the importance of insolation intensity rather than seasonally integrated insolation or season duration 2,3 . Winter temperatures varied less overall, consistent with predictions from insolation forcing, but also fluctuated in the early Holocene, probably owing to changes in meridional heat transport. The magnitudes of summer and winter temperature changes constrain the lowering of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet surface since the early Holocene to less than 162 m and probably less than 58 m, consistent with geological constraints elsewhere in West Antarctica 4-7 .The recovery of long-term climate proxy records with seasonal resolution is rare because of natural smoothing processes, discontinuities and limitations in measurement resolution.

        <p>Milankovitch famously postulated that variations of Earth's orbit and axis drive climate changes over tens of thousands of years by altering the seasonal cycle of insolation 1 . By controlling summer temperatures and ice ablation, summer insolation in the northern high latitudes is thought to drive global ice volume changes over glacial-interglacial timescales 8 . Although modelling studies support this idea 9,10 , empirical evidence of the specific climate response to insolation changes derives almost entirely from mean annual temperature reconstructions 11,12 or from indirect effects on, for example, trapped gases and melt layers in polar ice 13,14 and marine aeolian deposits 15 . The absence of seasonal temperature reconstructions has precluded direct evidence of insolation forcing on seasonal climate, a relationship that may vary geographically. In Antarctica, long records of multiple glacial-interglacial cycles have supported different claims about whether the effects of summer insolation relate most strongly to its maximum intensity, its seasonal integral or to duration above a threshold 2,3,16,17 . Site-specific empirical determinations would provide valuable tests of such competing ideas.Milankovitch famously postulated that variations of Earth's orbit and axis drive climate changes over tens of thousands of years by altering the seasonal cycle of insolation 1 .

        <p>We reconstructed seasonal temperature variability in West Antarctica through the Holocene (the last 11,000 years) and performed model experiments to understand its physical controls. The Holocene offers a window of time for assessing the influence of orbital forcing without the complicating effects of Northern Hemisphere deglaciation 18 . Our reconstruction (Figs. 1 and2) uses the high-resolution water-isotope record (δD) from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide ice core (WDC) [18][19][20] (Methods-Water isotopes; Extended Data Fig. 1a,b), obtained with a continuous-flow technique that provides millimetre-scale depth resolution 21 .

        <p>Records of seasonal temperatures from ice cores are limited by measurement resolution and information loss from water-isotope diffusion. In Greenland, the longest records separating summer and winter variability extend to only 2 thousand years ago (ka) (refs. 23,24 ), Nature | Vol 613 | 12 January 2023 | 293 whereas only climate model simulations are available for older periods 10 . For Antarctica, before the present study, the longest records spanned only a few centuries 25 . A combination of three factors accounts for the considerably greater scope of our reconstruction: exceptional depth resolution of measurements, conditions at WAIS Divide (high accumulation, low temperature and thick ice) which allow for preservation of subannual information through the entire Holocene 26 and an analysis strategy which circumvents interannual noise by evaluating millennial averages of the seasonal parameters.Records of seasonal temperatures from ice cores are limited by measurement resolution and information loss from water-isotope diffusion.

        <p>Our method corrects water-isotope variations for diffusion [26][27][28] and assesses uncertainties including preservation bias and precipitation intermittency (Methods-Diffusion corrections and Uncertainties in reconstructing temperatures). The diffusion correction operates on the high-resolution data and produces isotopic time series from which seasonal summer-winter amplitudes were extracted. These were converted to temperature using a model-derived scaling 29 (6.96‰ δD °C -1 ; Methods-Seasonal temperatures) and added to previously reconstructed annual mean temperatures 30 to obtain summer and winter histories.Our method corrects water-isotope variations for diffusion [26][27][28] and assesses uncertainties including preservation bias and precipitation intermittency (Methods-Diffusion corrections and Uncertainties in reconstructing temperatures).

        <p>Summer temperatures at WAIS Divide (Fig. 2a) generally rose through the early and middle Holocene, persisted at a maximum between about 5 and 1.5 ka, then decreased toward the present, with a total Holocene range of around 2 °C. These variations broadly correlate with local maximum insolation, rather than with integrated summer insolation or the duration of summer (Fig. 3d,e). Winter temperatures (Fig. 2c) varied less than summer ones overall (about 1 °C range) but also fluctuated at about 10 to 8 ka, a variation too rapid to attribute to orbital forcing.Summer temperatures at WAIS Divide (Fig. 2a) generally rose through the early and middle Holocene, persisted at a maximum between about 5 and 1.5 ka, then decreased toward the present, with a total Holocene range of around 2 °C.

        <p>To evaluate how orbitally driven insolation changes may explain the WAIS Divide reconstructed temperatures (Fig. 2), we first simulated temperature history at 80° S using a global, zonal mean (2° resolution) moist energy balance model (MEBM) accounting for incoming and outgoing radiation, albedo and meridional atmospheric-heat transport (Methods-Moist energy balance model). The model is driven by top-of-atmosphere (TOA) seasonal insolation changes (Fig. 3a-e); for this latitude, the maximum summer insolation increases until about 2.5 ka and annual mean and annual-and summer-integrated values mostly decline through the Holocene. The calculations yield summer maximum temperatures and seasonal temperature amplitudes (Fig. 3g) that covary with local maximum summer insolation (Fig. 3e) and with the general pattern of our reconstructed summer temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 7). Although heating at lower latitudes can influence Antarctic temperature through atmospheric and oceanic heat transport, modelled maximum summer temperatures at WAIS Divide correlate best with local insolation Shaded regions are 1σ and 2σ uncertainty ranges for combined uncertainties arising from analysis, diffusion correction, seasonality of accumulation, precipitation intermittency, isotope-temperature scaling and reconstructed mean temperatures (Methods-Uncertainties in reconstructing temperatures). Also shown are MEBM-calculated temperatures for 80° S (maximum and minimum annual values) and HadCM3 zonal temperatures for 80° S (late-December for summer, mid-August for winter) (ORBIT, GLAC1D and ICE-6G). The 0 ka ORBIT simulation uses pre-industrial settings, a calculation not available for GLAC1D or ICE-6G.

Indeed, models indicate heat export from WAIS Divide in summer (Extended Data Fig. 4k), rather than import from more northern locations. Since December is always the month of maximum insolation (Fig. 3a-c), variability of December insolation dominates the response of maximum summer temperature. For winter, modelled temperatures are less variable than those of summer at 80° S (Fig. 3g) because of the lack of direct insolation (Fig. 3b) and have an opposite trend. Winter minima are a function of three factors: changes in the length of the zero-insolation season, the effective cooling rate of the surface and convergent heat transport from lower latitudes. Lower minimum winter temperatures occur at times when the zero-insolation season is longer. However, neither the length of the zero-insolation season, modelled minimum temperatures, nor winter heat divergence correlate well with reconstructed winter temperatures.(70° to 90° S, R 2 = 0.9, P ≪ 0.001 during 0 to 6 ka) rather than insolation anywhere in the subtropical through subpolar latitudes (20° to 60° S, R 2 = 0.33-0.55, P &lt; 0.05).

        <p>To investigate the role of more-complex geography and mechanisms, including topographical changes not accounted for in the MEBM, we simulated Holocene climate with a fully coupled general circulation model, HadCM3 (ref. 35 ) (Methods-HadCM3 model simulations). Simulations forced solely by changes in orbital parameters produce summer maximum temperatures (for approximately the December solstice) at 80° S similar to our reconstructed values and to the MEBM: increasing over the Holocene, peaking at 4 to 3 ka and decreasing into the modern era (ORBIT, Fig. 2a). This pattern reflects a strong role of maximum summer insolation in determining observed summer temperatures. The similarity of the early-to mid-Holocene (11-6 ka) summer temperature increase in the orbitally forced HadCM3 simulations and our reconstruction suggests little influence of changing ice-sheet elevation and extent.

        <p>Next, as boundary conditions in the HadCM3 simulations, we prescribed variable greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and two different ice-sheet histories, GLAC1D and ICE-6G, which entail net surface lowerings of about 83 m and about 208 m, respectively, from 11 to 7 ka at the WDC site (Fig. 4a). These elevation scenarios substantially affect simulated temperatures (Fig. 2a,c). Much of the elevation-induced warming in these models, which occurs primarily in the early Holocene, can be attributed directly to the surface lapse-rate effect (Fig. 4b). However, comparison to the orbital-only runs (Fig. 4c) reveals a remaining temperature anomaly (Fig. 4d), attributable to GHGs, ice-sheet extent and nonlinear responses to simultaneously imposed forcings. Sea ice has only a small impact on the temperature at 80° S in summer (Methods-Sea ice; Extended Data Fig. 6).Next, as boundary conditions in the HadCM3 simulations, we prescribed variable greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and two different ice-sheet histories, GLAC1D and ICE-6G, which entail net surface lowerings of about 83 m and about 208 m, respectively, from 11 to 7 ka at the WDC site (Fig. 4a).

        <p>Inconsistencies exist between the different ice-sheet scenarios (Fig. 4d) and the summer versus winter seasons but differences are minor enough to permit a bounded estimate of the true Holocene elevation decrease. This calculation is made by comparing the excess of the reconstructed temperature increase over the orbital-only simulation to the same excess for the ice-sheet model simulations and scaling to the elevation changes used in the latter (Methods-Estimating elevation changes). We find central estimates for elevation decrease of 23 m and 53 m from comparison to the GLAC1D and ICE-6G scenarios, respectively, over the period 10 to 3.5 ka (Table 1). Accounting for uncertainties in the seasonal temperature reconstructions (Fig. 2) allows for elevation changes ranging from 33 m increase to 131 m decrease (2σ) from 10 to 3.5 ka or 54 m increase to 162 m decrease (2σ) if the time interval is narrowed to 10 to 6.5 ka (Table 1). Our results, thus, are consistent with geological observations of ice high-stands on mountain nunataks, which indicate less than 100 m of Holocene surface lowering [4][5][6] .Inconsistencies exist between the different ice-sheet scenarios (Fig. 4d) and the summer versus winter seasons but differences are minor enough to permit a bounded estimate of the true Holocene elevation decrease.

        <p>Winter temperatures on the Antarctic mainland must respond to insolation forcings indirectly, via heat transport from lower latitudes. Orbital forcing models predict winter cooling across the Holocene, mostly from 11 to 6 ka (Figs. 2c and3g). Both models and reconstructed winter temperatures lack a late Holocene maximum. But in the earlier Holocene, the winter reconstruction does not display the cooling trend expected from models and is dominated by prominent millennial variations. The mismatch with insolation at lower latitudes and absence of local forcings suggests variations in the efficacy of meridional atmospheric-heat transport.Winter temperatures on the Antarctic mainland must respond to insolation forcings indirectly, via heat transport from lower latitudes.

        <p>Previous analyses with simplified atmospheric models 3 identified the duration of Southern Hemisphere summer as a key driving variable of Antarctic climate at orbital timescales. Some palaeoclimate findings validate this claim; for example, the onset of deglacial warming in West Antarctica corresponds with increasing integrated summer insolation 2 . Our results-spanning about half a precession cycle-reveal a dominant role for annual maximum insolation in determining West Antarctic summer climate during the Holocene, without precluding a greater role for duration or integrated summer insolation in other periods, such as glacial terminations.Previous analyses with simplified atmospheric models 3 identified the duration of Southern Hemisphere summer as a key driving variable of Antarctic climate at orbital timescales.

        <p>SWIM is based on earlier numerical Rayleigh-type distillation models 53,54 , which simulate the transport and distillation of moisture down climatological temperature gradients. As moist air is transported towards the poles and cools, the saturated vapour pressure decreases nonlinearly and moisture above saturation is removed by precipitation. The model keeps track of the isotopic fractionations at each step along this distillation process. In most previous simple models, there is an inconsistency in the calculation of the supersaturation that determines the point of condensation and that drives kinetic isotope fractionation. Modifications to these earlier models, used in SWIM, ensure consistency in the calculation, which results in a smoother relationship between temperature and the δ-values of precipitation and better agreement with observed spatial patterns of δD and δ 18 O. Given input of both δD and δ 18 O data, SWIM calculates distributions of source temperatures, the temperature gradients of pseudo-adiabatic pathways and condensation temperature. We used SWIM to derive sensitivities for surface isotope-temperature scalings using diffusion-corrected WDC data to obtain a surface scaling of 6.96‰ δD °C -1 . Using raw data, the surface scaling is 7.07‰ δD °C -1 . In comparison to other isotope-temperature scalings, ref. 55 obtain about 6.56‰ δD °C -1 and ref. 30 about 7.10‰ δD °C -1 (both converted from δ 18 O to δD using a factor of 8).SWIM is based on earlier numerical Rayleigh-type distillation models 53,54 , which simulate the transport and distillation of moisture down climatological temperature gradients.

        <p>We included uncertainties associated with the following factors: measurement analysis, diffusion correction, seasonality of accumulation, precipitation intermittency, modelled isotope-temperature scaling and mean-temperature history. The 'analysis uncertainty' is 0.55‰ for δD (1σ) (ref. 21 ). The 'diffusion-correction uncertainty' is described in ref. 26 . The uncertainty of the mean-temperature reconstruction, calculated previously 30 , accounts for most uncertainty in the early Holocene but a small fraction in the late Holocene. Sections 'Seasonal preservation bias uncertainty' to 'Isotope-temperature scaling and associated uncertainty' below explain the other uncertainty terms. Uncertainties for some factors (analysis and diffusion correction) can be treated as independent random variables so that, on time-averaging, their magnitudes decrease as the inverse of the square root of the number of values. Uncertainties for other factors (intermittency, isotope-temperature scaling, mean temperature and seasonality) might be systematically biased and therefore their magnitudes are taken to be invariant with respect to the interval of averaging.

We used the Community Firn Model (CFM) 56,57 , a firn-evolution model with coupled firn temperature, firn densification and water-isotope modules, to test how seasonally weighted accumulation affects the diffusion of specified, hypothetical isotope records progressing from surface snow (δD snow ), to consolidated snowpack in the firn (δD firn ), to solid ice beneath the pore close-off depth (δD ice ). We applied the back-diffusion calculation (section on Diffusion corrections) to δD ice to estimate the original δD snow .

The seasonal cycle for δD snow is based on the mean amplitude in Fig. 1b (15.43‰). Five WAIS accumulation scenarios were tested on the basis of monthly accumulation from the regional climate model MAR3.6 (Modèle Atmosphèrique Règional; ERA-Interim forced) 58 , which spans the period January 1979 to December 2017. The mean accumulation over the entire 39-yr period is 0.24745 m ice equivalent yr -1 , with about 1.6× as much snow in winter (April to September) as in summer (October to March). The five scenarios are as follows: (1) 'constant': identical accumulation for all months (0.0206 m ice equivalent month -1 ; one-twelfth of the annual mean); (2) 'cycle': monthly accumulation equal to MAR monthly means;We performed five CFM runs using monthly time steps for accumulation, temperature and isotopes (Extended Data Table 1).

We repeated this 12-month time series for the duration of the model runs.

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 2a,b shows the results for the 'constant' and 'cycle' cases. The diffusion-correction technique accurately reconstructs δD snow for summer and winter in the 'constant' snowfall scenario but underestimates summer values in the MAR 'cycle' scenario by about 2.6‰, which is 11% of the full range of the observed WDC summer water-isotope values. Winter values are overestimated by only about 0.6‰, about 3% of the full winter range, since winter has 1.6× as much snow as summer. The 'noise', 'random' and 'loop' runs produce results within 0.3‰. These CFM experiments demonstrate that centennial trends in the summer and winter water isotopes of the order of a few per mil (‰) could arise from large changes in seasonal-accumulation weighting, whereas multimillennial trends ≫2.6‰ are unlikely to be caused by seasonal accumulation and can therefore be interpreted as climate signals of a different origin. For 1,000-yr averaging (as in Fig. 2), HadCM3 indicates seasonal-accumulation weighting (winter:summer) of 1.3 to 1.7 throughout the Holocene (Extended Data Fig. 2f), which yields a 1σ uncertainty of 0.27‰ based on the CFM testing criteria.Extended Data Fig. 2a,b shows the results for the 'constant' and 'cycle' cases.

        <p>To determine observationally if seasonal snowfall changed across the Holocene, we used measured black carbon (BC) concentrations, the only age-scale-independent impurity. BC data are available from 0-2.5 ka and 6-11 ka (ref. 22 ). Seasonal-fire regimes in South America dominate BC concentrations at WDC, causing BC maxima and minima in autumn and spring, respectively 59 (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We split each year into two parts, characterized by rising or falling BC: BC 1 and BC 2 the depth intervals of rising and falling BC (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The duration of BC 2 is longer than BC 1 owing to source characteristics 59 , thus BC 1 /BC 2 &lt; 1 (Extended Data Fig. 2e). The BC 1 /BC 2 ratio can change with time because of variability at the source, changes in atmospheric transport or seasonality of snow deposition. We observe little change in BC 1 /BC 2 resembling the multimillennial trends seen in WDC summers and winters (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Unless there are competing and exactly compensating effects in seasonality (the source change exactly cancels the depositional and transport change or other unlikely scenarios), the BC data provide evidence that changes in WDC seasonal snowfall were not large enough to affect our multimillennial climate interpretations.To determine observationally if seasonal snowfall changed across the Holocene, we used measured black carbon (BC) concentrations, the only age-scale-independent impurity.

        <p>Intermittency of precipitation uncertainty. The episodic nature of snowfall creates an incomplete record of local climate variations 60 , preventing interpretation of trends over short time intervals. We want to interpret isotopic variations averaged over a sufficiently long timescale so that, to within a specified tolerance, trends are not likely to be random noise arising from the spread of distributions preserved in the ice. Using distributions of reconstructed annual amplitudes (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2g) for 1,000-yr windows throughout the Holocene, we conducted Monte Carlo resampling simulations to determine that 250-yr averaging-lengths are needed to achieve a standard error of 1‰, corresponding to a mean amplitude-to-noise ratio of 15. For the time period with greatest variability, centred on 4 ka, the standard error for a 1,000-yr average (as used in Fig. 2) is 0.52‰ (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Because this is an amplitude uncertainty (rather than uncertainty associated with a season), we specify the 1σ uncertainties for summer and winter as half of 0.52‰.Intermittency of precipitation uncertainty.

We then subtracted the 1,000-yr averages from the 300-yr averages to obtain residuals and then determined R 2 values again for summer and winter versus the mean (Extended Data Table 2). From 11 to 0 ka, the high summer correlations for the 1,000-yr comparison indicate a strong association of the annual mean temperature with the summer temperature at orbital timescales. At suborbital scales (300-1,000-yr residuals), neither the summer nor the winter alone explain much of the mean annual variability and the annual mean is a random composite of the two seasons. If only 11-7 ka is considered, winter variability explains more of the mean at submillennial scales.Using 1,000-yr and 300-yr averages of summer, winter and mean temperature (Extended Data Fig. 3c-f), we determined R 2 values for summer and winter versus the mean.

        <p>Trend analysis. To assess the significance of dominant trends in our reconstructed seasonal temperatures, we conducted a Monte Carlo analysis founded on the assumption that all possibilities for the unknown time-dependence of errors are equally likely. The essential Article motivation for this approach is that we have determined the magnitudes of uncertainties as a function of age but that we have no information about whether the errors in our reconstruction persist at similar values for long periods of time (exhibit a bias) or whether they fluctuate at high-frequency.Trend analysis.

        <p>We randomly generated a large number of alternative seasonal temperature histories governed by the uncertainties on 1,000-yr averages (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), calculated the temperature trends for each alternative history over desired time intervals (such as 11-4 ka and 4-0 ka) and compiled the results into frequency distributions from which probabilities can be calculated (Fig. 2b,d). Specifically, each alternative history deviates from the summer and winter temperature reconstruction by an amount that smoothly varies over time between random nodes whose values are a Gaussian random variable of zero mean and standard deviation for 1,000-yr averages at the age of the node. The number of nodes and the age of each node are random variables, uniformly distributed between 1 and 11 nodes and 0-11 ka, respectively. A small number of nodes produce an alternative temperature history for which the bias is serially correlated for millennia, whereas a large number of nodes produce a history for which the bias is uncorrelated from millennium to millennium.We randomly generated a large number of alternative seasonal temperature histories governed by the uncertainties on 1,000-yr averages (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), calculated the temperature trends for each alternative history over desired time intervals (such as 11-4 ka and 4-0 ka) and compiled the results into frequency distributions from which probabilities can be calculated (Fig. 2b,d).

        <p>We used a simple global, zonal mean MEBM to calculate surface temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 4), accounting for TOA insolation, temperature-dependent longwave emission to space, temperaturedependent albedo to simulate brightening by snow and ice and horizontal atmospheric-heat transport treated as diffusion of near-surface moist static energy [61][62][63] . The model has a 2° spatial resolution, a single surface and single atmospheric layer and a surface-heat capacity based on the relative fraction of land and ocean surface in the zonal mean. Heat exchange between the surface and atmosphere layers arises from differences in blackbody radiation from each layer and sensible and latent heat exchanges proportional to temperature and specific humidity contrasts (assuming a constant relative humidity of 80%), following bulk aerodynamic formulae. We calculated the annual TOA insolation-cycle at every latitude in 500-yr time slices from 0 to 11 ka. For each time slice the model is run at 2 hour time resolution for 30 model-years to reach equilibrium.We used a simple global, zonal mean MEBM to calculate surface temperatures (Extended Data Fig. 4), accounting for TOA insolation, temperature-dependent longwave emission to space, temperaturedependent albedo to simulate brightening by snow and ice and horizontal atmospheric-heat transport treated as diffusion of near-surface moist static energy [61][62][63] .

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 4 compares the temporal evolution of summer maximum and winter minimum heat divergence by the atmosphere (∇•F) at the WDC site to the summer maximum and winter minimum site temperature and insolation. Although Holocene changes in ∇•F at the WDC site correlate with insolation forcing, the magnitude of changes in maximum direct insolation are much larger than those in atmospheric-heat divergence. Further, the Holocene changes in summertime heat divergence are of the wrong sign to cause net heating at the WDC site (positive divergence is an export of heat by the atmosphere from the site). Heat transport in the Antarctic is convergent in the annual mean but divergent in mid-summer, as intense incoming insolation exceeds longwave emissions from the cold surface.Extended Data Fig. 4 compares the temporal evolution of summer maximum and winter minimum heat divergence by the atmosphere (∇•F) at the WDC site to the summer maximum and winter minimum site temperature and insolation.

        <p>Summer climate. We examined the zonal mean at 80° S in simulations for hypothetical 10 ka worlds, by changing the boundary conditions to compare to the pre-industrial/late Holocene. These simulations are '10 ka ORBIT-only'; two runs with only ice sheets at 10 ka and pre-industrial settings otherwise, called '10 ka GLAC1D-only' and '10 ka ICE-6G-only'; and two runs with all 10 ka forcings, called '10 ka GLAC1D-all' and '10 ka ICE-6G-all'. In '10 ka ORBIT-only', reduced TOA shortwave radiation causes a large reduction in shortwave radiation at the surface (SW d ) and consequent cooling. Downward longwave radiation (LW d ) also decreases, probably because of atmospheric cooling. Sensible heat flux (SH d ) to the surface is increased, indicating that the atmosphere and surface do not equally cool; one cause of this is the increased meridional heat convergence (-∇•F).Summer climate.

        <p>The preceding description of changes in the zonal mean in the 10 ka simulations compared to pre-industrial period holds for the entire Holocene epoch. Orbital forcing alone reduces SW d and LW d by roughly the same magnitude. With full forcing (including ice sheets), the reduction in LW d is roughly three times the reduction in SW d . Considering an energy budget over the WDC site (79.467° S, 112.085° W), mechanisms are the same as for the zonal mean. Magnitudes of forcings change but reduced SW d still cools the surface, amplified by an LW d feedback dependent on ice-sheet size.The preceding description of changes in the zonal mean in the 10 ka simulations compared to pre-industrial period holds for the entire Holocene epoch.

        <p>Winter climate. During winter, SW d is no longer a factor as the sun is below the horizon, yet there is still surface warming caused by an increase in LW d . An increase in -∇•F in '10 ka ORBIT-only' warms the atmospheric temperature, increasing LW d and SH d . With an ice sheet imposed, the surface temperature cools. In both '10 ka GLAC1D-only' and '10 ka ICE-6G-only' there is a reduction in -∇•F, reducing LW d and SH d . When all 10 ka forcings are introduced, the change in temperature is smaller than for ice sheet-only runs. In '10 ka GLAC1D-all' we found no change in -∇•F, LW d or surface temperature. This suggests that the increase in -∇•F from orbital forcing is almost perfectly balanced by the change in -∇•F from the ice-sheet configuration.Winter climate.

        <p>The processes controlling heat transport over Antarctica are complicated and HadCM3 may not be able to simulate them perfectly. Our simulations indicated that remote processes during winter alter the heat transport, affecting atmospheric and surface temperatures. Raising the topography of Antarctica tends to reduce such heat transport (Extended Data Fig. 5), producing an additional cooling on top of a pure lapse-rate effect 75 . This cannot, however, explain the prominent millennial-scale changes at about 9.2 and about 7.9 ka (Figs. 1e and2c).The processes controlling heat transport over Antarctica are complicated and HadCM3 may not be able to simulate them perfectly.

        <p>The zonal mean of the change in the sea ice that we prescribed can be seen in Extended Data Fig. 6e and the change in the SST can be inferred from Extended Data Fig. 6f-h. Extended Data Fig. 6f shows that the atmosphere-only model replicates the change in temperature of the coupled model. Extended Data Fig. 6g shows that the effect of the 10 ka orbital configuration ('Atmos_10k_insol') is to cool Antarctica considerably by about 0.5 °C. North of 65° S there is no change in the surface temperature, primarily a response to the imposed SST and sea ice, which are the same in the 'Control' and 'Atmos_10k_insol'. Imposing the SST and sea ice from 10 ka ('Atmos_10k_ice_SST'), we find very little change in the surface temperature over Antarctica but there are some large changes in the surface temperature north of 70° S. Extended Data Fig. 6h shows the result of imposing 10 ka SST or 10 ka sea ice. The 10 ka SST ('Atmos_10k_SST') tends to warm Antarctica, consistent with the large increases in SST north of 65° S. Changing sea ice ('Atmos_10k_ice') tends to cool Antarctica. Both effects are small, approximately 0.1 °C and of opposite sign. This explains the small net change in the surfacetemperature change over Antarctica when SST and sea ice are changed simultaneously, as shown by 'Atmos_10k_SST_ice'. It should be noted that in the coupled system a change in sea ice cannot be decoupled from a change in the SST, so not only is the effect of sea ice on the climate small, it is also probably associated with a compensating change in SST.

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 6e shows that the change in sea ice at 10 ka in ORBIT is much larger than the change in either GLAC1D or ICE-6G. The ORBIT simulations do not account for all of the changes in the boundary conditions at 10 ka and are therefore less realistic than either ICE-6G or GLAC1D. Because ICE-6G and GLAC1D both show much smaller changes in the sea ice and SST than ORBIT, we expect that in reality there is also a much smaller change in the sea ice and SST than in ORBIT.

We found that the atmosphere-only model does not compare well with the coupled model, simulating very little change in the surface temperature. Doing a term-by-term decomposition of the atmosphere model is not, therefore, particularly useful as it tells us more about the model rather than the physical climate. The failure of the atmosphere-only model to capture the changes at 10 ka suggests that the importance of the SST and sea ice is in their day-to-day coupling with the atmosphere and not in any long-term mean change in this season.We also performed a similar analysis of the winter season (not shown).

Specifically, the estimated elevation decrease is ΔZ R = ΔZ M ((ΔT R - ΔT O )/(ΔT M - ΔT O )).

        <p>Accounting for uncertainties in ΔT R requires recognizing that uncertainties of summer and winter reconstructions are not independent, while also recognizing that they emerge from two independent sources: uncertainty in the mean annual temperature history (calculated in ref. 30 ) and uncertainty in the seasonal amplitude (calculated in the present study). In general, the uncertainty of seasonal temperature at a specified time is the quadrature sum of annual and amplitude uncertainties, which gives 1σ and 2σ uncertainties for a given season and time. However, if the true value of annual temperature is shifted by an amount ασ from the nominal reconstruction, this must be true for both summer and winter. And if the true value of amplitude is shifted by an amount βσ from the nominal reconstruction, the temperature shift must be +βσ in one season but -βσ in the other.Accounting for uncertainties in ΔT R requires recognizing that uncertainties of summer and winter reconstructions are not independent, while also recognizing that they emerge from two independent sources: uncertainty in the mean annual temperature history (calculated in ref. 30 ) and uncertainty in the seasonal amplitude (calculated in the present study).

        <p>To define bounding cases on elevation change in a specified time interval, we calculated the maximal (or minimal) temperature change ΔT R for a season by differencing the upper (or lower) limit at one end of the interval with the lower (or upper) limit at the other end and also calculating the corresponding ΔT R for the opposite season required by the correlated errors. The elevation decreases ΔZ R were then calculated by comparison to HadCM3 simulations, as specified previously and the summer and winter values averaged. This process was completed four times for each time interval and HadCM3 model, corresponding to four different initial ΔT R (maximum and minimum ΔT R for summer and maximum and minimum ΔT R for winter) and the most extreme case taken as the result (this proved to be the one starting with maximum summer ΔT R ). Table 1 lists results for two time intervals and the two HadCM3 simulations with variable topography. Extended Data Fig. 2 | Precipitation uncertainties. Uncertainties for seasonally weighted accumulation are shown in a-f, and for precipitation intermittency in g-h. a, The diffusion envelope of CFM output data (50-yr avg.), based on an input sine wave with f = 1yr -1 and amplitude = 15.43‰. The original (input) amplitude of the signal (black, dotted-dashed lines) decreases as time passes due to diffusion and downward advection of the firn, as shown by the decay of the maximum (red) and minimum (blue) lines, while the mean values of the 'constant' and 'cycle' (black solid and dashed lines, respectively) scenarios do not change and are dependent on the seasonal weighting of snowfall. b, Diffused CFM output data from beneath the pore close-off depth (&gt;200 yr) (black lines; smaller amplitude), with diffusion-corrected data shown with grey lines (larger amplitude). Red circles are the annual maximum value, and blue circles the annual minimum, selected using the same algorithm as Fig. 1a. c, A zoom of black carbon (BC) concentrations at ~6.5 ka 22,59 . The maxima (red circles) and minima (blue circles) can be used to separate approximate depth intervals corresponding to winter (BC 1 ) and summer (BC 2 ); vertical blue lines correspond to nominal January 1, as defined by the peak of nssS/Na 22 . d, The 140-yr averages for BC 1 (blue) and BC 2 (red). The grey line is WDC annual accumulation 76 , orange circles are BC 1 + BC 2 , which should equal annual accumulation. e, Black carbon seasonality BC 1 /BC 2 (black), based on (d). f, Accumulation seasonality for HadCM3 seasonal snowfall (red line) compared to the range of seasonality tested using the CFM (dashed blue lines) and modern MAR seasonality 58 (blue diamond). g, Distribution of annual amplitudes for water isotopes for a 1,000-year window centred at 4 ka. h, Standard errors are determined for 1,000-realizations of random sampling of the distribution in (g) to determine a standard deviation of the residuals of the true mean minus the mean of the random sampling. Plots for temperature anomaly normalized to the mean (blue), insolation (red), and heat divergence (black) for the annual mean (d,g,j), annual max (e,h,k), and annual min (f,i,l).
