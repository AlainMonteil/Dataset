The variance in observed (Sonde) and modeled (ATLAS) ∆O 3 (shown in the ordinate of Fig. 1) that is explained by the quantity OLP (Ozone Loss Potential) that is computed using PFP (PSC Formation Potential), as a function of the value of the exponent η in the expression for OLP (Eq. 7) (red). Here, variance is reported as the square of the correlation coefficient between ∆O 3 and the value of OLP associated with the specific 6 or 15 winters for which ∆O 3 has either been modeled or observed, respectively. The results shown in blue are for the use of ARP (Aerosol Reactivity Potential), rather than PFP, in the expression for OLP (Eq. 8). Supplementary Figure 18.
