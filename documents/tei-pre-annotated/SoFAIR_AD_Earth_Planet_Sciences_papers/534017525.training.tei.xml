        <p>Molecular clusters are ubiquitous constituents of the ambient atmosphere, that can grow into larger sizes forming new aerosol particles. The formation and growth of small clusters into aerosol particles remain one of the largest uncertainties in global climate predictions. This has made the modelling of atmospheric molecular clustering into an active field of research, yielding direct molecular level information about the formation mechanism. We review the present stateof-the-art quantum chemical methods and cluster distribution dynamics models that are applied to study the formation and growth of atmospheric molecular clusters. We outline the current challenges in applying theoretical methods and the future directions to move the field forward.Molecular clusters are ubiquitous constituents of the ambient atmosphere, that can grow into larger sizes forming new aerosol particles.

        <p>Atmospheric vapour molecules, with strong intermolecular interactions, can accumulate in the gas phase forming molecular clusters (Kulmala et al., 2013). Provided that the interactions between the molecules are strong enough, these molecular clusters can be stable against evaporation. Stable clusters can further growth into larger sizes by uptake of additional vapour molecules and eventually form aerosol particles (here defined as 2 nm in diameter or above). If not scavenged by other sources, such as coagulation on pre-existing particles, the particles can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) when they reach diameters of ∼50-100 nm. The interactions between aerosol particles and clouds remain the least understood process in global climate estimation (IPCC), and presently, up to half the number of CCN is believed to originate from new particles formed in the atmosphere from gas-phase molecules (Merikanto et al., 2009). Even minor changes in the parameterization of the early growth of particles between 1.7 nm and 3.0 nm can lead to up to a 50% increase in modelled cloud condensation nuclei (Tröstl et al., 2016). The formation of ultrafine particles presents a large problem for air quality and our health. This is a growing concern, especially in densely populated areas, such as megacities in China, where visible air pollution has become a daily plague. Long term exposure to ultrafine aerosol particles can lead to inflammation in the lungs, potentially resulting in lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Gan et al., 2013;Falcon-Rodriguez et al., 2017;Mei et al., 2018). The world health organisation (WHO) has estimated that ∼7 million premature deaths are annually linked to air pollution (WHO). Thus a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the initial steps in forming new particles and their early growth is essential for improving our understanding of the global climate system and to better control the adverse health effect of ultrafine aerosol particles.Atmospheric vapour molecules, with strong intermolecular interactions, can accumulate in the gas phase forming molecular clusters (Kulmala et al., 2013).

        <p>In recent years, the scientific interest in atmospheric molecular clusters has steadily increased and it presents a relatively new and rapidly expanding field of research. While many experimental techniques have been developed to study the formation and growth of atmospheric clusters into large aerosol particles, there exist no single method that can effectively uncover the process from the smallest clusters up to large particles. For instance, there is a significant gap between the largest sizes that can be measured using chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface mass spectrometer (up to ∼1.5 nm in diameter) and the smallest size that can be measured by aerosol mass spectrometers (from ∼50 nm). Theoretical simulations can be utilized to obtain detailed knowledge about the initial steps in cluster formation and growth pathways (∼0.5-1.5 nm), which remain difficult to assess using state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Recent advances in theoretical methods have allowed the modelling of atmospheric molecular clusters to bloom and permit studies of significantly larger clusters than previously possible. However, there is still a persisting gap between the size of the currently modelled clusters and the sizes which are usually measured in the ambient atmosphere. Modelling this transition regime between 1-2 nm is of utter importance as evidence suggests that this is the region where critical processes for cluster survival occur (see Figure 1). In this review, we discuss the progress, outline some of the current challenges and future prospects in modelling the formation and growth of atmospheric molecular clusters.In recent years, the scientific interest in atmospheric molecular clusters has steadily increased and it presents a relatively new and rapidly expanding field of research.

        <p>Detection of aerosol particles can be performed using Neutral cluster and Air Ion Spectrometers (NAIS) (Kulmala et al., 2007;Manninen et al., 2009) or condensation particle counters (CPC) (McMurry, 2000) with detection thresholds down to around 2-3 nm in diameter (McMurry, 2000). State-of-the-art measurement techniques such as particle size magnifiers (PSM) (Vanhanen et al., 2011) now allows the detection of particles as small as ∼1.7 nm, but these instruments have poor counting efficiency and are not standard instrumentation in the field (Kontkanen et al., 2017). However, particle counters yield no insight into the chemical composition of the detected particles or any mechanistic understanding on how they were formed. Using offline filter techniques chemical classification of particle constituents can be performed using, for instance, gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) (Noziére et al., 2015). This requires a large mass of particles to be collected on the filters, and potentially important trace compounds will not be detected. Online information about the composition of aerosol particles (in the ∼50 nm to ∼1 m size range) can be obtained using an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) (Davis, 1973).Detection of aerosol particles can be performed using Neutral cluster and Air Ion Spectrometers (NAIS) (Kulmala et al., 2007;Manninen et al., 2009) or condensation particle counters (CPC) (McMurry, 2000) with detection thresholds down to around 2-3 nm in diameter (McMurry, 2000).

        <p>To obtain online information about the composition of atmospheric molecular clusters, a chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF) (Jokinen et al., 2012) can be utilized. This technique relies on charging the clusters, which might change their molecular composition and lead to fragmentation inside the instrument (Zapadinsky et al., 2019;Passananti et al., 2019). This implies that the measured cluster might not be representative of the cluster that was initially formed. For instance, most water molecules that are present in the cluster will Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth instantly evaporate during the detection process (Ehn et al., 2010;Schobesberger et al., 2013). Various reagent ions (nitrate (Ehn et al., 2012(Ehn et al., , 2014;;Hyttinen et al., 2015), iodide (Lee et al., 2014;Iyer et al., 2016), acetate/lactate (Berndt et al., 2016;Jen et al., 2016b;Hyttinen et al., 2017) and bisulfate (Sipilä et al., 2015)) are sensitive towards different molecular systems and not all clusters may be efficiently detected by a single charging technique. An improved resolution compared to the CI-APi-TOF can be achieved by applying the recently developed CI-Orbitrap technique which shows promising applications in the detection of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) (Riva et al., 2019). Cryogenic techniques can be applied to hinder the evaporation process and coupling mass spectrometry with infrared spectroscopy allows the direct detection of charged cluster compositions and makes it possible to study arrangement of molecules in the cluster (Waller et al., 2018). Using tandem MS coupled to an ion trap, the influence of adding water to the cluster structures has been directly detected (Yang et al., 2018).To obtain online information about the composition of atmospheric molecular clusters, a chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface mass spectrometer (CI-APi-TOF) (Jokinen et al., 2012) can be utilized.

        <p>With state-of-the-art instruments some of the compounds that might potentially be involved in new particle formation have been revealed in recent years. Over the oceans, the primary source of CCN is believed to be dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is produced by phytoplankton and emitted into the atmosphere. The emitted DMS is then oxidized by OH/Cl radicals and the mechanism is believed to involve the formation of low volatile acids such as methanesulfonic acid and sulfuric acid which drive the formation of new particles (Charlson et al., 1987). In coastal regions, iodine emissions from biogenic sources have been shown to form marine aerosols (O'Dowd et al., 2002). The mechanism is believed to be linked to the formation of iodic acid which can produce particles via sequential addition of iodic acid molecules (Sipilä et al., 2016).With state-of-the-art instruments some of the compounds that might potentially be involved in new particle formation have been revealed in recent years.

        <p>In continental regions, sulfuric acid and water have been definitively established as important components in particle formation (Sipilä et al., 2010). Nitrogen-containing compounds with high basicity such as ammonia (Kirkby et al., 2011;DePalma et al., 2012DePalma et al., , 2014)), monoamines (Kurtén et al., 2008;Almeida et al., 2013;Jen et al., 2014;Glasoe et al., 2015), diamines (Jen et al., 2016a;Elm et al., 2016aElm et al., , 2017d) ) and guanidine (Myllys et al., 2018(Myllys et al., , 2019b;;Hemmilä et al., 2020) have been shown to efficiently enhance sulfuric acid based new particle formation provided that they are present at even ppt-level mixing ratios. Carboxylic acids have also been claimed to enhance sulfuric acid based new particle formation (Zhang et al., 2004). Highly oxygenated organic molecules termed HOMs (Bianchi et al., 2019) have also been speculated to participate in sulfuric acid based new particle formation (Schobesberger et al., 2013;Riccobono et al., 2014), but most likely ionic pathways are required to facilitate the process (Kirkby et al., 2016;Rose et al., 2018). An overview of potentially important species for cluster formation and growth are shown in Figure 2. Ionic pathways greatly facilitate new particle formation rates when the vapour concentrations are low (Wagner et al., 2017). In general, the ion production rate in the atmosphere is too low for the ionic pathways to explain new particle formation bursts. Thus, particle formation seems to be mainly driven by neutral pathways. The overall particle formation mechanism is generally a matter of the correct timing of relevant chemical species colliding under the right atmospheric conditions (Bianchi et al., 2016). Multi-component sulfuric acid -ammonia -HOM clusters were studied in the CLOUD chamber. It was found that the components had a synergistic enhancing effect on particle formation and that covalently bound HOM dimers most likely contributed more to process compared to the monomers (Lehtipalo et al., 2018).In continental regions, sulfuric acid and water have been definitively established as important components in particle formation (Sipilä et al., 2010).

        <p>The total concentration of molecules in ground-level atmospheric conditions (pressure around 1 atm and temperatures on the order of 250-300 K) is on the order of 10 19 molecules cm -3 . At high relative humidities, the mixing ratio of water may be around 1%, corresponding to ∼10 17 molecules cm -3 . The concentration of any other condensable vapour is always many orders of magnitude lower. For example, ammonia mixing ratios can reach tens of ppb, i.e. 10 11 molecules cm -3 , while amine concentrations are typically substantially lower. Even in very polluted environments, the most studied driver of atmospheric new-particle formation, sulfuric acid, seldom exceeds 10 8 molecules cm -3 . The very reason that the key components have low gas-phase concentrations is that they efficiently transform into the condensed phase. Hence, attempting to identify atmospheric trace species in the gas phase that might be important for new particle formation presents the common conundrum of finding "a needle in a haystack".The total concentration of molecules in ground-level atmospheric conditions (pressure around 1 atm and temperatures on the order of 250-300 K) is on the order of 10 19 molecules cm -3 .

        <p>There are multiple different ways of classifying particles in the atmosphere. For our purposes, the most important distinction is between primary and secondary particles. Primary particles, such as desert or road dust, soot, pollen etc., have been emitted into the air as pre-existing particles, though their size and other properties may subsequently change due to processing in the atmosphere. In contrast, secondary particles have been completely formed in the air by the Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth clustering of gas-phase molecules. Especially within aerosol physics, it is customary to separate this initial clustering process ("particle formation") from the subsequent condensation of gas molecules onto both primary and secondary particles ("particle growth"). The precise threshold between "clusters" and "particles" is ambiguous, and varies with the property of interest.

        <p>The particle origin, e.g. biogenic/anthropogenic: Note that this distinction is often difficult to apply, for example in the case of human-induced forest fires, or particles composed of organic nitrates formed in reactions of biogenic carbon compounds with anthropogenic nitrogen oxides.The particle origin, e.g. biogenic/anthropogenic: Note that this distinction is often difficult to apply, for example in the case of human-induced forest fires, or particles composed of organic nitrates formed in reactions of biogenic carbon compounds with anthropogenic nitrogen oxides.</p>
        <p>Composition, e.g. organic/inorganic: In principle this classification is straightforward to apply, as "organic" can be defined as any compound containing C-H bonds. In practice, aminium bisulfate or aminium sulfate salts are often implicitly included in the "inorganic" category even though the amines contain carbon atoms, and "organic" is reserved exclusively for non-basic volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation products.Composition, e.g. organic/inorganic: In principle this classification is straightforward to apply, as "organic" can be defined as any compound containing C-H bonds.

        <p>Phase state, e.g. solid/liquid: The phase state of larger particles is an area of intense research, see (Virtanen et al., 2010;Shiraiwa et al., 2011;Pöschl and Shiraiwa, 2015;Shiraiwa et al., 2017;Reid et al., 2018) and will not be discussed here. For the smallest clusters, the distinction is unclear, and possibly irrelevant. It should be noted that in typical applications of quantum chemistry to atmospheric clusters, it is simultaneously assumed that clusters are "crystal-like" in the sense that their partition functions can be computed using rotational and vibrational energy levels corresponding to one or more minimum-energy structures (the global minimum and possibly a limited number of low-lying local minima), but "liquid-like" in the sense that interconversions between the different minima are rapid, compared to the timescale of evaporation reactions. This is based on the assumptions that there are no significant free energy barriers between the different minima. If the latter condition does not hold, then the assumption that clusters quickly re-organize to the global minimum structure after each collision would not be valid. Under the assumption that the rapid interconversion between minima holds, the probability that a given cluster is found in some specific configuration ( ) is proportional to exp(-Δ bind, /RT), where Δ bind, is the binding energy of the configuration (see section 4.4), is the molar gas constant and is the temperature.Phase state, e.g. solid/liquid: The phase state of larger particles is an area of intense research, see (Virtanen et al., 2010;Shiraiwa et al., 2011;Pöschl and Shiraiwa, 2015;Shiraiwa et al., 2017;Reid et al., 2018) and will not be discussed here.

        <p>Particle formation is often loosely called nucleation. Strictly speaking, if the evaporation probability of even a dimer containing only two molecules is lower than the probability that the clusters grow, particle formation is kinetically controlled, and should not be called nucleation, and classical nucleation theory (equation (1)) cannot be applied. If clusters have to grow up to a threshold size (the critical cluster size) before the growth probability exceeds the evaporation probability; the process is genuine nucleation. Since the evaporation rate does not depend on the vapour concentrations (it is an inherent property of the cluster), while the growth rate is directly proportional to the vapour concentration, the very same particle formation mechanism may or may not involve nucleation, depending on the vapour concentration. In the case of nucleation, the formation free energy, related to the binding free energy and definition in section 4.5, exhibits a barrier. Figure 3 sketches three different types of commonly encountered formation free energy surfaces.Particle formation is often loosely called nucleation.

        <p>Free Energy Cluster Formation Free Energy Cluster Formation Free Energy Another important distinction to make is that between (thermal) evaporation, and various types of scattering or nonaccommodation. While both refer to the process of a molecule escaping from a cluster, the timescales of the processes are very different at least for condensing vapors and conditions relevant to the lower atmosphere. Cluster-molecule collisions occur on timescales of picoseconds (the time it takes a molecule traveling at typical thermal velocities of hundreds of meters per second to cross a typical molecular/cluster with a diameter of a nanometer or less). Collisions may then lead to immediate scattering (on the timescale of picoseconds), or to the uptake of the molecule onto the cluster surface for at least one vibrational period (typically also on the order of picoseconds for intermolecular vibrations). For example, any excess energy from the collision event will be removed by thermalizing collisions (with N 2 and O 2 gas molecules) occurring at a rate of around 10 10 s -1 at atmospheric pressure. Thus, loss due to energy non-accommodation occurs within a few nanoseconds. The net growth probability (or growth rate) can be defined as the product of the collision probability (or rate) and the uptake or accommodation coefficient. This coefficient is often assumed to be unity, and despite considerable research, no universal consensus has emerged as to the correct value of the coefficient even for simple systems such as pure H 2 O surfaces. In contrast to collisions and non-accomodation processes, evaporation of fully accommodated molecules occurs at substantially longer timescales; for example, for sulfuric acid -base clusters relevant to new-particle formation, the evaporation rates at 298 K are usually well below 10 6 s -1 (Olenius et al., 2013;Elm, 2017). For example, for a typical H 2 SO 4 concentration of around 10 7 molecules cm -3 and a molecule-cluster collision rate around cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 , the threshold for "stability" is an H 2 SO 4 evaporation rate below 10 -3 s -1 .Free Energy Cluster Formation Free Energy Cluster Formation Free Energy Another important distinction to make is that between (thermal) evaporation, and various types of scattering or nonaccommodation.

Thus, loss due to energy non-accommodation occurs within a few nanoseconds. The net growth probability (or growth rate) can be defined as the product of the collision probability (or rate) and the uptake or accommodation coefficient. This coefficient is often assumed to be unity, and despite considerable research, no universal consensus has emerged as to the correct value of the coefficient even for simple systems such as pure H 2 O surfaces. In contrast to collisions and non-accomodation processes, evaporation of fully accommodated molecules occurs at substantially longer timescales; for example, for sulfuric acid -base clusters relevant to new-particle formation, the evaporation rates at 298 K are usually well below 10 6 s -1 (Olenius et al., 2013;Elm, 2017). For example, for a typical H 2 SO 4 concentration of around 10 7 molecules cm -3 and a molecule-cluster collision rate around cm 3 molecule -1 s -1 , the threshold for "stability" is an H 2 SO 4 evaporation rate below 10 -3 s -1 .</p>
        <p>To simplify the discussion above, we have referred exclusively to the collision and evaporation of single molecules. However, for sufficiently strongly bonded multicomponent systems (e.g. sulfuric acid and many amines), the concentration of small clusters may be comparable to that of the free monomers, and cluster-cluster collisions, as well as the reverse process of cluster fragmentation to two smaller clusters, must be taken into account. Even in the much weaker bound H 2 SO 4 -H 2 O system, the very large atmospheric concentration of H 2 O leads to a large fraction of the H 2 SO 4 monomers existing as hydrates, and this must be accounted for even though most other cluster-cluster collisions or fragmentation reactions can be ignored.To simplify the discussion above, we have referred exclusively to the collision and evaporation of single molecules.

        <p>The birth-death equations themselves contain only a few implicit assumptions about the clustering system. First, a single set of birth-death equations describes clustering at one point in space. If the concentrations, or conditions in general, vary strongly in space, the equations should be solved separately for different regions. Second, the use of thermal evaporation rates assumes that the system, including the clusters, has a well-defined temperature, which is not affected by the clustering process. This implies first of all that the clusters are only a small part of the total system. This certainly holds in the atmosphere, as the vast majority of gas molecules are N 2 and O 2 . Second, it also implies that the nascent clusters formed by collisions have a sufficient number of internal degrees of freedom, permitting them to live long enough to be thermalized by collisions with a carrier gas (e.g. N 2 and O 2 ). Due to the relatively large number of atoms in the key molecules likely responsible for atmospheric particle formation, the assumption of thermalization at pressures encountered in the lower atmosphere (0.1 to 1 atm, or roughly 10 000 to 100 000 Pa) is unlikely to be a major source of error. The probability of fragmentation or evaporation due to energy non-accommodation (i.e. imperfect thermalization) decreases rapidly with the number of vibrational modes in the cluster, which is equal to 3 -6, where is the number of atoms in the cluster. A common misconception, possibly originating from simulations of clustering of atoms, e.g. metals or noble gases, is that would equal the number of molecules. For example, in a sulfuric acid dimer ( = 14), there are already 36 vibrational modes. Even if only a fraction of these are accessible for accommodating excess energy, thermalization at 1 atm is likely to be essentially complete -especially after accounting Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth for the almost inevitable presence of one or more H 2 O molecules, which provide both additional vibrational modes, and a "sacrificial cooling" -type mechanism in which water molecules are lost instead of H 2 SO 4 (Kurtén et al., 2010). It should be mentioned that if the colliding molecules are more complex, the amount of excess energy released after collision is also increased which would promote non-thermal evaporation. We note that the assumption of complete thermalization also implies a lack of dependence of the clustering process on the total pressure (see section 4.5 for a discussion of the reference pressure, which often causes confusion). While the assumption of thermalization is likely valid throughout the lower atmosphere, there are situations in which energy non-accommodation and non-thermal fragmentation need to be accounted for, such as inside mass of spectrometer instruments (Hogan. Jr and Fernandez. de. la. Mora, 2010;Thomas et al., 2016;Zapadinsky et al., 2019). This can conceptually be thought of as adding an energy axis to the birth-death equations, with especially fragmentation rates being summed over energies in addition to daughter cluster types.The birth-death equations themselves contain only a few implicit assumptions about the clustering system.

        <p>There are two main approaches for solving the birth-death equations. The historical approach has been to use the liquid-drop model based on classical bulk thermodynamics to predict cluster properties, and a further set of simplifying assumptions allowing the birth-death equations to be solved analytically. This approach is known as classical nucleation theory (CNT). More recently, computational chemistry tools have permitted the calculation of cluster properties from molecular interactions, and these can be combined with numerical solutions of the birth-death equations for a limited set of cluster sizes.

        <p>Regardless of the approach chosen, one additional approximation is almost inevitably done when solving the birthdeath equations: evaporation rates ( ( , ) ) are never calculated or simulated directly for atmospherically relevant systems, but instead indirectly deduced using statistical mechanics tools. The reason for this is simple: the timescales for the key evaporation rates of the relevant molecules are far too long for direct simulation of the dynamic process, even with the cheapest possible computational models (classical force fields). By far the most common approach is to first calculate the collision rates for example from kinetic gas theory, and then derive evaporation rates by applying detailed balance to an equilibrium situation. The use of kinetic gas theory assumes that the clusters are in the free molecular regime, as their size is much smaller than their mean free path.

        <p>The key computational concept involved in deriving evaporation rates from collision rates within both CNT and cluster distribution dynamics is the cluster binding free energy Δ bind or closely related Δ form (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): the free energy change in going from the isolated monomers to the cluster. In quantum chemistry based studies, this is usually specified as the Gibbs binding free energy, but we note that given the assumption that the clusters are only a vanishingly small part of the total system, the Gibbs free energy, Helmholz free energy and grand potential are actually identical (Vehkamäki, 2006).The key computational concept involved in deriving evaporation rates from collision rates within both CNT and cluster distribution dynamics is the cluster binding free energy Δ bind or closely related Δ form (see sections 4.4 and 4.5): the free energy change in going from the isolated monomers to the cluster.

        <p>One of the central problems in using classical nucleation theory to predict atmospheric particle formation is the treatment of proton transfer. Proton transfer reactions are essential for forming stable clusters, and the extent of proton Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth transfer depends not only on the relative amounts of, for example, acid and base molecules in the cluster, but also the actual numbers of molecules, in other words the cluster size. The liquid drop model assumes that clusters of all sizes exhibit the bulk value for the extent of proton transfer, which depends on composition, but not size. This introduces a significant error in the formation free energies of the smallest clusters. For example, for a cluster with one ammonia and one sulfuric acid molecule, the liquid drop model predicts a complete proton transfer, but the more realistic quantum chemical methods indicate that no proton transfer will occur. The liquid drop model thus overestimates the stability of these cluster drastically.One of the central problems in using classical nucleation theory to predict atmospheric particle formation is the treatment of proton transfer.

        <p>Cluster distribution dynamics are based on first obtaining collision (or growth) and evaporation rates for some predefined set of clusters (using for example free energies from quantum chemical calculations), and then numerically solving the birth-death equations up to some maximum cluster size (for example, 4 H 2 SO 4 and 4 NH 3 molecules). Chemical intuition can often be used to reduce the number of clusters that need to be explicitly modelled; for example a (NH 3 ) 4 cluster will have a very high evaporation rate, and such clusters can thus be omitted from the set of simulated clusters (defined here as the set of clusters for which the birth-death equations are explicitly solved). An example of a typical acid -base simulation cluster set is shown in Figure 5 represented by 4×4 grid. In addition to not relying on bulk thermodynamic models, the advantage of cluster distribution dynamic simulations is that they are not restricted by the rather stringent approximations inherent in CNT. For example, time-dependence, cluster-cluster collisions or cluster fragmentations to two smaller clusters can be trivially included. The most obvious error sources in cluster distribution dynamic simulations are the sink processes and the accuracy of the free energies used in determining the evaporation rates from equation (2). Section 5 discusses the accuracies and error sources related to the free energies. A less obvious, but equally important, potential source of error is related to the boundary conditions used in the simulation, including for example the limit of the set of simulated clusters, the treatment of clusters outside this set, and the choice of parameters kept constant (e.g. monomer concentration, total concentration of molecules of a certain type in the system, or monomer production rate).

        <p>Most applications of cluster distribution dynamics to date have used molecule-cluster and cluster-cluster collision rates directly from kinetic gas theory for neutral molecules and clusters, and standard parametrizations for collisions involving ions. However, some studies have applied "sticking factors" (equivalent to accommodation coefficients in the discussion above) below unity (Almeida et al., 2013;Lu et al., 2020), leading to reduced growth rates -and by the logic of detailed balance, also reduced evaporation rates. Such sticking factors may be motivated simply by improving the agreement with experimental results, or by qualitative physical arguments such as sulfuric acid -amine clusters needing to collide with each other in a particular orientation for sticking to occur as e.g. the non-polar alkyl groups of the amines are unlikely to bind to each other sufficiently strongly. However, molecular dynamics simulations of collisions between sulfuric acid and dimethyl amine suggests that the intermolecular interactions between the molecules are strong enough to alleviate initial collision orientations that are not optimal, leading to a sticking factor of one (Loukonen et al., 2014). Very recently, molecular dynamics simulations have also allowed the direct simulations of collision rates accounting explicitly for both the non-spherical shape of molecules, as well as attractive dipole-dipole interactions. For the case of H 2 SO 4 -H 2 SO 4 collisions, this has been found to result in an enhancement of the collision rate by about a factor of 2.2 (Halonen et al., 2019); even larger enhancements are likely for e.g. H 2 SO 4 -amine clusters as their dipole moment are larger. It is noteworthy that a similar enhancement factor has already been suggested for H 2 SO 4 -base clustering based on comparison to experimental studies (Kürten et al., 2014). We note that while these enhancements (or sticking) factors may seem large, they are still much smaller than the typical uncertainties in the evaporation rates calculated based on quantum chemical data due to the exponential dependence on the formation free energies in Equation (2).Most applications of cluster distribution dynamics to date have used molecule-cluster and cluster-cluster collision rates directly from kinetic gas theory for neutral molecules and clusters, and standard parametrizations for collisions involving ions.

        <p>Cluster distribution dynamics models present a powerful toolkit to understand particle formation pathways, which gives direct information on the formation mechanism and to interpret experimental results. However, caution with these models should be advised as they are very sensitive to the thermochemical input data. A common misconception is that the modelled results can be taken as the quantitative "true" atmospheric value. Discrepancies between model and experiment can result from: a) The proposed mechanism is incorrect. b) Inaccuracies in the model. c) Inaccuracies in the experiment. d) All of the above.Cluster distribution dynamics models present a powerful toolkit to understand particle formation pathways, which gives direct information on the formation mechanism and to interpret experimental results.

        <p>Another common issue leading to erroneous conclusions is that the choice of concentrations, temperature and losses is not reasonable for the environment being simulated. For example, quite often measurements of ground level concentrations are directly extrapolated to higher altitudes where the temperature is significantly lower. As the saturation vapour pressure is temperature dependent, it is not possible to have very high concentrations at low temperature. On a similar note, a very high concentration of vapours in the polluted atmosphere, will also be associated with a large loss of clusters due to condensation on pre-existing particles. These effects should be taken into consideration when setting up the dynamics model.Another common issue leading to erroneous conclusions is that the choice of concentrations, temperature and losses is not reasonable for the environment being simulated.

        <p>Another very important thing to consider is how to model the monomer concentration of a given species. Should the concentration be held constant or be allowed to change over the course of the simulation? A constant concentration corresponds either to continuous production of the monomer or a compound which is massively in excess, e.g., its losses are negligible compared to the total concentration. Alternatively, the monomer concentration can be simulated using a fixed amount of formed monomers, which eventually will lead to depletion of the monomer in the gas phase Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth as the compound partitions to the cluster phase. The effect of monomer depletion was explicitly demonstrated by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2019) who studied the chemical reaction between methanol and SO 3 forming the less-volatile methyl hydrogen sulfate compound. One would assume that the formation of a less volatile species would lead to an increased particle formation potential, but on the contrary, the formation of methyl hydrogen sulfate consumes an appreciable amount of atmospheric SO 3 . This implies that less SO 3 is available to form sulfuric acid by reacting with water and thus limiting particle formation. The complete opposite trend was observed in the simulations if the concentration of SO 3 was kept constant instead of being allowed to be consumed by the reactions with methanol.Another very important thing to consider is how to model the monomer concentration of a given species.

Using a fixed free sulfuric acid monomer concentration, will allow a higher enhancement at increasing dimethylamine concentration, as with increasing DMA concentration the total concentration of sulfuric acid molecules, including those bound to clusters, increases. This is essentially an unphysical behaviour if the sulfuric acid concentration is not in large excess. As illustrated by these sensitivity tests it is of utter importance that the above mentioned checklist is followed when applying cluster distribution dynamics models. The potentially largest error involved in particle formation studies using cluster distribution dynamics models still lies in the applied thermochemistry and especially whether the correct global minimum structure has been found.

It should be mentioned that the temperature effect is included in an ad hoc fashion using statistical mechanics, and the cluster structures remain 0 K minimum energy structures. To correctly account for temperature effects, long molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations need to be performed.

        <p>When calculating the vibrational frequencies of clusters, it is common that several low-lying frequencies with less than 100 wave numbers emerge. Essentially, these low frequency vibrations are not strictly vibrations as such, but corresponds to a collective pivotal movement of the cluster. The second term in the vibrational contribution to the total entropy of a harmonic oscillator, given by ( 25), goes to infinity as the vibrational frequency goes towards zero, and thus the harmonic oscillator approximation becomes a large source of errors when low vibrational frequencies are present in the cluster. One way to correct this deficiency is to employ a quasi-harmonic approximation. Ribeiro et al. (Ribeiro et al., 2011) employed a simple approach where all vibrational frequencies below 100 cm -1 were raised to up 100 cm -1 . Stefan Grimme (Grimme, 2012) proposed an alternative approach where the contribution of low frequencies to the entropy is replaced by a corresponding rotational entropy.

        <p>Anharmonic calculations can be applied to small benchmark systems with the goal of deriving universal scaling factors between the harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies. This process has been applied to many single molecules and has provided an ad hoc approach for approximating anharmonic frequencies (Pople et al., 1981;III). However, this is not a well established procedure for molecular clusters and has only been applied to a few systems. It should be noted that scaling factors correct for both the deficiency in the applied ab initio method, as well as anharmonicity within a single factor.Anharmonic calculations can be applied to small benchmark systems with the goal of deriving universal scaling factors between the harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies.

        <p>As the entropy depends on the pressure entering Equation ( 23) for both the reactant(s) and the product(s), the numerical values for the binding or reaction free energies typically also depend on this pressure.

As the used reference pressure (or reference concentration) is an arbitrary number, this may seem counterintuitive and can lead to misunderstandings especially when the sign of Δ add is assumed to carry a special meaning, for example, with a negative Δ add assumed to imply "spontaneity". This implies that the threshold free energy for a spontaneous reaction is different in gas-phase chemistry, where a reference pressure of 1 atm = 101325 Pa Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth is commonly used, and in liquid-phase chemistry, where the reference concentration is usually 1 mol/L.

        <p>A frequent misconception concerning the Δ form surfaces is that the product pressure is neglected, as it is kept at 1 atm.

This contrasts with the typical calculations done in, for example, chemical thermodynamics, where both the reactant and the product concentrations are used to deduce whether a reaction will proceed in the forward or reverse direction.A frequent misconception concerning the Δ form surfaces is that the product pressure is neglected, as it is kept at 1 atm.

The composite methods have been developed for accurate thermochemistry of molecules, but are highly empirical and not necessarily accurate for atmospheric relevant cluster systems. The B3RICC2 level was compared to measured cluster evaporation rates and found to perform well (Ortega et al., 2012). Large differences between the B3RICC2 and PW91/6-311++G(3df,3pd) calculated thermochemistry have been pointed out (Nadykto et al., 2014). However, this is solely based on the fact that there exists a difference between the numbers calculated by the two methods and with no further comparison with higher level methods, it was difficult to assess which method is actually at fault. The RI-CC2/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z single point energy correction was most likely chosen as it was the highest level of theory applicable at the time. However, CC2 (Christiansen et al., 1995) has been developed primarily for excited state properties, so there is little assurance that it should work well for ground state properties. Furthermore, the leading terms in the CC2 equations are dominated by MP2 terms, and thus higher accuracy than regular MP2 cannot be assumed. In fact, benchmark studies have shown that the RI-CC2/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z single point energies severely over-predicts the stability of atmospheric molecular clusters (Schmitz and Elm, 2020). This will lead to B3RICC2 representing an upper bound of the simulated particle formation rates. Thus, in general, the RI-CC2/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z single point energy correction cannot be recommended for studying atmospheric clusters.The RI-CC2/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z//B3LYP/CBSB7 level of theory (termed B3RICC2) has routinely been applied to study atmospheric relevant cluster systems (Ortega et al., 2012;Paasonen et al., 2012;Kupiainen-Määttä et al., 2012;Henschel et al., 2014Henschel et al., , 2016;;Ortega et al., 2016;Olenius et al., 2017;Li et al., 2020b;Lu et al., 2020).

        <p>Based on the benchmark study of Elm et al. (Elm et al., 2012), the M06-2X functional should perform more reliably than other functionals for obtaining the structures and reaction Gibbs free energies for small clusters compared to experimental methods. It should be mentioned that the PW6B95-D3 and B97X-D functionals were not among the functionals tested in the benchmark set. While it should perform well compared to experimental results, the M06-2X has been found to severely over-predict the binding energy of clusters consisting of sulfuric acid and highly oxidized organic molecules (HOMs) (Elm et al., 2015(Elm et al., , 2016b) ) compared to Coupled Cluster methods. This shows that the M06-2X functional is not well transferable to other cluster systems, which might originate from the fact that it is heavily parameterized.Based on the benchmark study of Elm et al.

Out of the tested functionals, the B97X-D functional performed the best with a mean absolute deviations of 2.12 kcal/mol. The PW91 and M06-2X functionals performed slightly worse with mean absolute deviations of 3.28 and 3.46 kcal/mol, respectively. The superiority of the B97X-D functional compared to other density functionals have further been corroborated by comparison of the binding energies with CCSD(T) complete basis set estimates for test sets up to 45 atmospheric relevant clusters (Elm and Kristensen, 2017;Schmitz and Elm, 2020).

        <p>As mentioned in section 5, the DFT binding energies constitute the largest source of errors. A common approach is to correct the electronic single point energy of the clusters with a more reliable method such as CCSD(T). It should be noted that the DFT structures are not true minima on the higher level energy surface, though it is assumed that the surfaces are to some extend parallel. Using different DFT functionals (PW91, M06-2X and B97X-D) for geometry optimizing the same cluster conformations and calculating the binding energies with LCCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 on top of each, has shown that there is very little difference (mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.58 kcal/mol for B97X-D) in the calculated binding energies (Elm and Mikkelsen, 2014). In a similar manner, it was shown that there was little difference (MAE of 0.40 kcal/mol for B97X-D) in the binding energy when changing the basis set used to optimize the DFT geometry from a large 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set to a small 6-31++G(d,p) basis set. This illustrates that the DFT geometries are quite decent and that it is less important which of the PW91, M06-2X and B97X-D functionals was used for obtaining the geometry and whether the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) or 6-31++G(d,p) basis set was Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth utilized, as long as a higher level correction is applied.

        <p>When calculating binding energies, the emergence of basis set superposition errors (BSSE) might become a concern. BSSE arise in the calculation of binding energies as the interacting monomers come into the vicinity of each other. This leads to a lowering of the total electronic energy of the system as each fragment is stabilized by the overlapping basis function from another fragment. This leads to an over-prediction of the binding energy. As the clusters of interest are usually quite large, it is more or less impossible to apply a large enough basis set to completely suppress the BSSE. One approach to suppress BSSE is to apply the counterpoise (CP) correction (Boys and Bernardi, 1970), but this is very time consuming and no guarantee to lead to more reliable results. It has been shown in several studies (Elm et al., 2017a;Myllys et al., 2016b;Elm and Kristensen, 2017), that when limited to small/medium basis sets the uncorrected calculations actually agree better with the complete basis set limit compared to the CP corrected values (see Figure 9 for an illustration). This has been shown to be valid for both the DFT (Myllys et al., 2016b) and DLPNO (Elm et al., 2017a) binding energies. There exist several cost efficient approaches to correct for BSSE. Galano and Alvarez-Idaboy (Galano and Alvarez-Idaboy, 2006) developed an atom by atom approach denoted CP . Frank Jensen further extended this approach into a generalized atomic counterpoise correction (ACP( )) (Jensen, 2010), where denotes the number of bonds between atoms for defining the subspace of basis functions. In this framework the ACP(1) method also included neighbouring atoms, making it identical to the CP method. Kruse and Grimme (Kruse and Grimme, 2012) further developed this concept into a geometric counterpoise correction (gCP) that only depends on the input geometry of the molecule/cluster. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these approaches have been tested on atmospheric molecular cluster systems.When calculating binding energies, the emergence of basis set superposition errors (BSSE) might become a concern.

        <p>Besides the potential BSSE, binding energy calculations might also suffer from basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE). This is definitely an issue when calculating the binding energy of a cluster using a small basis set. Benchmark calculations such as performed by Myllys et al. (Myllys et al., 2016b) are valuable in quantifying the potential errors one make when applying a too small basis set for calculating the binding energies. At least triple zeta basis sets are required for obtaining properly converged binding energies using DFT. It should be mentioned that geometries and the thermal contribution to the free energy require a significantly smaller basis set than the binding energies and one can get away with a double zeta basis set as long as the binding energy is corrected with a larger basis set. Explicitly correlated (F12) methods highly suppress both the BSSE and BSIE, and results in a good agreement with the complete basis set limit can be obtained even when using a cc-pVDZ-F12 basis set.Besides the potential BSSE, binding energy calculations might also suffer from basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE).

        <p>The cluster formation process involves loss in the number of degrees of freedom as hydrogen bonds are formed. This will inevitably lead to a negative entropy contribution and hence to a positive -Δ -value. For atmospheric relevant systems the Δ -value will be negative and is associated with attractive intermolecular interactions such as H-bonds. To illustrate typical Δ add -values for atmospheric relevant systems we look further into the following three types of cluster formation reactions recently presented by Schmitz et al.

        <p>Other thermochemical functions, such as the enthalpy, entropy and their associated thermal contributions can calculated from, by simply exchanging with either , , , thermal or thermal . It should be mentioned here that the thermal contributions also include the zero point vibrational energy. All the structures were obtained at the B97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory and the single point energy has been calculated at the DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 )-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory with a TightPNO criterion. All the data are taken from the Schmitz et al. (Schmitz and Elm, 2020) paper. To decompose the influence of the different contributions to the free energy, Figure 10 shows box-and-whisker plots (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum) of the Δ add , Δ add and Δ add values calculated for the 45 cluster addition reactions. The Δ add -values span a large range from -12.5 kcal/mol (sulfuric acid -dimethylamine) to +1.6 kcal/mol (nitric acid dimer). Naturally, this very large range originates from the fact that the interactions are specific to what molecules actually interact. This large range emerges primarily from the pure electronic energy Δ add contribution, with only a minor contribution from the Δ add, thermal term, which lies in the range of +0.9 kcal/mol to +2.7 kcal/mol. The thermal contribution to the free energy (Δ add, thermal ) also vary very little between the different systems with a range from +10.3 kcal/mol (nitric acid -water) to 14.1 kcal/mol (methanesulfunic acid -ethylenediamine). Again it should be mentioned that the Δ add, thermal term as given by equation ( 47) includes both the entropy contribution and the Δ thermal contribution. The changes in the Δ add, thermal contribution is primarily caused by the minor variation in the entropy contribution from -29.3 cal/mol⋅K to -39.8 cal/mol⋅K. All these values are very sensitive to the applied level of theory and can easily change by up to a few kcal/mol if a different method is used either for optimizing the cluster structures or to calculate the binding energy. This further illustrates that obtaining accurate binding energies are likely more important than the thermal contribution to the free energy, in the (quasi)harmonic oscillator framework. This conclusion is valid under the assumption that the (quasi)harmonic approximations yield reasonable entropies. The fact that different DFT methods tend to give similar entropies support this assumption. Furthermore, this clearly shows that strong intermolecular interactions are most important for the cluster formation process as the entropy penalty is within a similar range for most atmospheric relevant cluster addition reactions. However, it should be noted that for large clusters the rigid rotor harmonic oscillator approximations used in this example will most likely lead to a larger range in the Δ add -values, especially if the clusters are "fluffy".Other thermochemical functions, such as the enthalpy, entropy and their associated thermal contributions can calculated from, by simply exchanging with either , , , thermal or thermal . It should be mentioned here that the thermal contributions also include the zero point vibrational energy. All the structures were obtained at the B97X-D/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory and the single point energy has been calculated at the DLPNO-CCSD(T 0 )-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory with a TightPNO criterion. All the data are taken from the Schmitz et al. (Schmitz and Elm, 2020) paper. To decompose the influence of the different contributions to the free energy, Figure 10 shows box-and-whisker plots (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum) of the Δ add , Δ add and Δ add values calculated for the 45 cluster addition reactions. The Δ add -values span a large range from -12.5 kcal/mol (sulfuric acid -dimethylamine) to +1.6 kcal/mol (nitric acid dimer). Naturally, this very large range originates from the fact that the interactions are specific to what molecules actually interact. This large range emerges primarily from the pure electronic energy Δ add contribution, with only a minor contribution from the Δ add, thermal term, which lies in the range of +0.9 kcal/mol to +2.7 kcal/mol. The thermal contribution to the free energy (Δ add, thermal ) also vary very little between the different systems with a range from +10.3 kcal/mol (nitric acid -water) to 14.1 kcal/mol (methanesulfunic acid -ethylenediamine). Again it should be mentioned that the Δ add, thermal term as given by equation ( 47) includes both the entropy contribution and the Δ thermal contribution. The changes in the Δ add, thermal contribution is primarily caused by the minor variation in the entropy contribution from -29.3 cal/mol⋅K to -39.8 cal/mol⋅K. All these values are very sensitive to the applied level of theory and can easily change by up to a few kcal/mol if a different method is used either for optimizing the cluster structures or to calculate the binding energy. This further illustrates that obtaining accurate binding energies are likely more important than the thermal contribution to the free energy, in the (quasi)harmonic oscillator framework. This conclusion is valid under the assumption that the (quasi)harmonic approximations yield reasonable entropies. The fact that different DFT methods tend to give similar entropies support this assumption. Furthermore, this clearly shows that strong intermolecular interactions are most important for the cluster formation process as the entropy penalty is within a similar range for most atmospheric relevant cluster addition reactions. However, it should be noted that for large clusters the rigid rotor harmonic oscillator approximations used in this example will most likely lead to a larger range in the Δ add -values, especially if the clusters are "fluffy".</p>
        <p>Previous sections discuss quantum chemistry calculations conducted on molecular atmospheric clusters. To compute these, the computer must be given a concrete cluster structure (configuration = set of atom nuclei coordinates). For a specific cluster consisting of a set of molecules, infinite configurations can be created by shifting some atoms, and each configuration has an associated potential energy. The entirety of all possible configurations shapes the potential energy surface on which a minima/configuration with lower (free) energy represents a more stable structure. The aim of configurational sampling/exploration processes is to identify the most stable cluster structures (global minimum and low-lying local minima). Local minimum can be found by minimization of the potential energy as a function of atomic coordinates. Generally, it is straightforward to locate the most stable structures for simple molecules consisting of only a few atoms. However, the potential energy functions for many-body systems, such as molecular clusters, become very complicated as numerous possible energy minima appear. Figure 11 shows an example of the potential energy function of configurational space known as the potential energy surface. To simplify, the configurational space represents all possible nuclei positions, which correspond to a multi-dimensional space (overall 3 -6 degrees of freedom, where is number of atoms).

        <p>Figure 11 illustrates several local minima which are connected by a so-called disconnectivity tree (or graph). (Bryngelson et al., 1994) The disconnectivity tree aids in guiding which minima structures are similar (e.g., two structures which are part of the same tree branch or sub-branch) and which minima are very different, i.e., those what are "disconnected" by long distance on the configurational space. To move from a given starting configuration to a distant minima on configurational space, you have to move the atoms significantly or completely reorganize the entire system to reach it. Figure 11 displays diverse depth of energy minima, variously high energy barriers, and different topologies and shapes of the potential energy surface (PES). Combined this complexity makes the configurational search for the global (free) energy minimum of molecular clusters extremely challenging.Figure 11 illustrates several local minima which are connected by a so-called disconnectivity tree (or graph).

        <p>Many different approaches have been utilized to sample the configurational space of atomic clusters (Huang et al., 2010;Wales and Doye, 1997;Zhang and Dolg, 2015) or exploring complicated PES in for instance protein folding (Bryngelson et al., 1994;Smellie et al., 2003;Wales, 2018;Plotkin and Onuchic, 2002).

In order to explore all thermodynamically stable minima, several studies have utilized various thermodynamic simulations such as sampling from molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations (Shields et al., 2010;Husar et al., 2012) and its variations such as simulated annealing (Loukonen et al., 2010), umbrella sampling (Loukonen et al., 2010;Xie et al., 2019) and basin hopping (Chen et al., 2017;Peng et al., 2015;Miao et al., 2015;Jiang et al., 2014;Wales and Doye, 1997). However, the disconnectivity tree grows exponentially with cluster size and for systems containing more than 3-4 molecules thermodynamic simulations usually do not have enough time to explore all essential tree branches.

        <p>Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth urational space, several random distribution sampling techniques have been utilized. Elm et al. (Elm et al., 2013b,c) randomly place a new molecule around cluster minima of size -1 to obtain the cluster . Another approach is using a grid of points created around the -1 cluster. Using Fibonacci spheres (González, 2009) the grid points can be evenly distributed around the cluster and a new molecule is placed and reoriented to form the cluster (Kildgaard et al., 2018a,b). For clusters containing molecules with several rotamers a systematic rotor approach coupled with random sampling can be used for a more thorough exploration of the PES. Combining these two methods is particular handy for molecular clusters containing organic molecules such as pinic acid (Elm et al., 2014). However, even these systematic approaches do not effectively sample the tremendous number of molecular cluster configurations.Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth urational space, several random distribution sampling techniques have been utilized.

        <p>Recently, several genetic algorithm programs (
            <rs type="software">OGOLEM</rs> (Dieterich and Hartke, 2010), 
            <rs type="software">ABCluster</rs> (Zhang andDolg, 2015, 2016) and 
            <rs type="software">CLUSTER</rs> (Kanters and Donald, 2014)) for configurational sampling of molecular clusters have been introduced. Their primary focus is searching for a global minimum, but they also save all identified local minima during the PES exploration. 
            <rs type="software">ABCluster</rs>, which uses the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (Karaboga and Basturk, 2008), has already been utilized in many configurational sampling procedures of atmospherically relevant molecular clusters (Liu et al., 2018b;Hou et al., 2017;Malloum et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2020c;Wang et al., 2019;Myllys et al., 2019a,c). Temelso et al. (Temelso et al., 2018) applied a genetic algorithm to generate the initial configurations and narrow down the configurations initially with a semi-empirical method and subsequently using density functional theory. Kubečka et al. (Kubečka et al., 2019) have developed the Jammy Key for Configurational Sampling (JKCS) program, which couples the ABCluster program with other 3rd-party quantum chemistry programs. Moreover, they have introduced an approach of including various isomers/protonation states of cluster molecules in the initial guess, which consequently overcome the problem of non-reactive potentials of force-field methods. Recently, Odbadrakh et al. (Odbadrakh et al., 2020) proposed a similar protocol based on generating the initial configurations using the 
            <rs type="software">OGOLEM</rs> program. While these genetic algorithms show promising applications in cluster formation studies involving acids and bases, they rely on treating the molecules as rigid in the global optimization using a force field, which makes the methods difficult to apply to systems containing organic molecules with many rotamers. Recently, Rasmussen et al. (Rasmussen et al., 2020)coupled the approach outlined by Kubečka et al. (Kubečka et al., 2019) with the systematic hydrate sampling approach by Kildgaard et al. (Kildgaard et al., 2018a,b) for studying the shallow potential free energy surface of sulfuric acid -water clusters. This approach appears to be a viable approach to study multicomponent atmospheric molecular clusters involving water.

        <p>Inspiration for proper configurational exploration could be obtained from various artificial neural networks or other machine learning methods already applied in several protein folding studies. (Fleetwood et al., 2020;Chen and Ferguson., 2018;Galvelis and Sugita, 2017) However, the main focus of configurational exploration is to provide enough initial guesses that cover the entire PES. Therefore, utilizing computationally cheap molecular mechanics methods in the initial step is assumed to be the most viable option. Subsequently, the molecules have to be optimized at a higher level of theory. Furthermore, we usually search for thermodynamically stable structures, i.e., structure minima not with respect to the lowest potential energy, but to the lowest Gibbs free energy. This implies that the search for the lowest free energy minimum, will depend on the chosen temperature. The potential energy surface depends on the computational method of choice. This implies that different methods might locate a different number of stable structures in the sampling process. Generally, the main bottleneck in configurational sampling remains the selection of important configurations for further calculations at a higher level of theory.Inspiration for proper configurational exploration could be obtained from various artificial neural networks or other machine learning methods already applied in several protein folding studies.

That is why we need descriptors that express variables, functions or features which provide a way to construct a unique representation for each cluster structure. A good descriptor should fulfil certain requirements, e.g., invariance with respect to the rotation of the cluster and permutation of atom indices.

        <p>Uniqueness: Two molecular clusters can be assumed to be the same (one of them is redundant) if a (set of) descriptor(s) for them differ less than some predefined threshold. For example, when two configurations differ in energy less than 0.001 Hartree and, at the same time, differ in dipole moment less than 0.1 Debye, then, they are very likely to be identical and the difference is caused by numerical precision. Another option would be utilizing root mean square distances (RMSD) (Kildgaard et al., 2018a) of two clusters with ordering implemented according to Temelso et al. (Temelso et al., 2017) The disadvantage here is that it is only a relative value between two structures and therefore lacks interpretability. The RMSD has to be minimized in order to allow for a selection of configurations.Uniqueness: Two molecular clusters can be assumed to be the same (one of them is redundant) if a (set of) descriptor(s) for them differ less than some predefined threshold.

For example, all configurations which have (free) energy 20 kcal/mol or more higher than the configuration with the lowest energy. Filtering cut-off depends on the step in the configurational sampling procedure. For instance, the cut-off in free energy predicted by a semi-empirical method should be significantly higher than the cut-off in DFT free energy.Filtering: Configurations could be removed if their descriptors lies out of some predefined range.

Some of them have been implemented as libraries in Python such as Quantum Machine Learning (QML) (Christensen et al., 2017) and DScribe (Himanen et al., 2020). The descriptors range from fingerprint-style (Cereto-Massagué et al., 2015) to those that represent the whole geometry of the structure (Huo and Rupp, 2017), with the latter being the preference when modelling non-covalently bound cluster PES.

        <p>The purpose of well-chosen descriptors is to enable the use of algorithms that allow for a sophisticated selection of molecular structures to calculate. In the past, this was commonly performed via a manual selection of certain "best" energies. Kubečka et al.

Clustering can be used to address the aforementioned bottleneck in configurational sampling as a more sophisticated filtering method (removal of redundant structures) and can be applied in different fields (Lo et al., 2018).

        <p>The occurrence of local free energy minima affects the calculation cluster free energies. A common, but erroneous approach for accounting higher energy local minima when calculating free energies has been the application of Boltzmann averaging. This will lead to an increase in the cluster Gibbs free energy when accounting for multiple conformers and implies that the cluster becomes less stable which corresponds to a lowering in the number of available microstates in the system. The existence of multiple conformers should always lead to an increase in the number of available microstates and hence a lowering of the free energy. To correctly account for the effect that multiple conformers has on Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth the free energy, the following relation should be used (Partanen et al., 2016b,a;Ho et al., 2016):The occurrence of local free energy minima affects the calculation cluster free energies.

        <p>This will correctly lead to a lowering of the free energy as more conformers are taken into account. The effect of including higher free energy conformers has been shown to be relatively small on the order of -1 kcal/mol or lower for sulfuric acid -ammonia and sulfuric acid -pinic acid clusters (Partanen et al., 2016b), sulfuric acid -guanidine clusters (Kubečka et al., 2019) and sulfuric acid -water clusters (Rasmussen et al., 2020). It has also been illustrated that conformers 3 kcal/mol higher in energy compared to the lowest one will not contribute significantly to the free energy and can safely be neglected (Partanen et al., 2016b). This implies that other sources of errors are more pronounced and effort is better spend in improving other calculation parameters compared to performing an exhaustive search of all available conformers. For instance, not finding the global minimum yields a significantly larger error than not considering higher energy local minima. While the effect of including higher energy conformers is small, proper sampling techniques as outlined in section 6.1 will automatically generate a large set of relevant conformers. Albeit being a minor effect, it is worth considering as all the required data are available after sampling the relevant cluster structures.This will correctly lead to a lowering of the free energy as more conformers are taken into account.

        <p>The earliest studies (Kurdi and Kochanski, 1989;Arstila et al., 1998;Bandy and Ianni, 1998;Re et al., 1999;Natsheh Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth et al., 2004) only considered a single sulfuric acid molecule clustered with few water molecules and simply focussed on obtaining the cluster structures and binding energetics. Particular emphasis was shown on how many water molecules are required for the first dissociation of sulfuric acid in the clusters. Ding and Laasonen (Ding and Laasonen, 2004) extended the cluster data set up to (sa) 1 (w) 6-9 clusters to investigate whether sulfuric acid could be fully dissociated in the two component cluster system. They found that the fully dissociated clusters were close in energy to the partially dissociated clusters, but in no cases was a fully dissociated cluster found as the global minimum. These findings indicate that fully dissociated clusters could co-exist with their partial dissociated counterparts and as the produced SO 2- 4 ion in the cluster will be encapsulated in water molecules, this suggested that sulfuric acid molecules at the aerosol surfaces are unlikely to be fully deprotonated. These studies are extremely valuable as they showed the initial proton transfer did not occur in the smallest clusters, indicating that the CNT approach of using the liquid drop model, implicitly assuming that the clusters behave as a bulk solution, is highly inaccurate for the smallest clusters. Using equilibrium distributions that obey the law of mass action Noppel et al. (Noppel et al., 2002) derived a scheme to correct the CNT by treating the sulfuric acid molecule as in equilibrium with the surrounding water vapour. Water can then be taken into account by the respective hydrate distribution. This approach has been used to estimate how many water molecules that can be expected to bind to a given cluster (Loukonen et al., 2010;Temelso et al., 2012a,b;Henschel et al., 2014;Rasmussen et al., 2020).The earliest studies (Kurdi and Kochanski, 1989;Arstila et al., 1998;Bandy and Ianni, 1998;Re et al., 1999;Natsheh Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth et al., 2004) only considered a single sulfuric acid molecule clustered with few water molecules and simply focussed on obtaining the cluster structures and binding energetics.

        <p>Despite its simplicity, and considerable effort that has been made in studying the sulfuric acid water system, to date there still do not exist any studies that have reported sulfuric acid cluster formation explicitly from individual molecules up to large measurable sizes (∼2 nm in diameter). As seen in Table 1 the largest number of sulfuric acid molecules in the clusters remain four and more than five water molecules have not been considered.Despite its simplicity, and considerable effort that has been made in studying the sulfuric acid water system, to date there still do not exist any studies that have reported sulfuric acid cluster formation explicitly from individual molecules up to large measurable sizes (∼2 nm in diameter).

        <p>Based on both experimental and theoretical evidence it is the general consensus that some stabilizing species is required for sulfuric acid particle formation to occur in the boundary layer. Very early it was established that ammonia, being the most abundant base molecule in the atmosphere, had a significant enhancing effect on sulfuric acid cluster formation. Table 2 summarizes quantum chemical cluster formation studies involving sulfuric acid, bases and water. Modelling Clusters Formation and Growth simple alkyl amines (methyl-, dimethyl-and trimethylamine) as these are usually present in the highest concentrations in the atmosphere. More than 150 different amines and 30 amino acids have been identified in the atmosphere from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources (Ge et al., 2011). Because of the complexity of quantum chemical calculations, most studies to date still only consider a single type of amine in the cluster. Essentially, the correct formation mechanism might include the combination of many different amines. Recent studies have also established that there exist a synergistic effect between different bases, which implies that not only the basicity of the base and their relative abundance is important, but also the exact molecular structure in the form of the number of available hydrogen bond donors/acceptors has a crucial influence on the ability to form particles. Including different types of bases in the cluster very quickly leads to a large number of different combinations of cluster compositions and the amount of relevant configurations rapidly gets out of hand.Based on both experimental and theoretical evidence it is the general consensus that some stabilizing species is required for sulfuric acid particle formation to occur in the boundary layer.

        <p>While experimental and theoretical work shows that amines highly enhance sulfuric acid driven new particle formation compared to ammonia, it is still relatively unknown how high amine concentrations actually are in different environments. This is caused by the fact that atmospheric measurements of amine concentrations are extremely difficult to perform and requires very sensitive equipment. Amines might be emitted from very local sources and the concentration in the gas phase is always found to be low. This can very well be linked to their high potential to "stick" to sulfuric acid which might hinder their detection in the gas phase as they more or less instantly partition to the cluster phase.While experimental and theoretical work shows that amines highly enhance sulfuric acid driven new particle formation compared to ammonia, it is still relatively unknown how high amine concentrations actually are in different environments.

        <p>As demonstrated by Table 2 there exist very few studies that actually consider the synergistic effect of different base molecules in the clusters (Kupiainen-Määttä et al., 2012;Temelso et al., 2018;Myllys et al., 2019a;Li et al., 2020b). Similarly, studies investigating the effect of water on sulfuric acid -base clusters also remain scarce. To obtain realistic datasets, synergistic effects should be further studied in the future, most likely combined with the effect of also considering hydrated clusters. While it will be important to study new sulfuric acid -base systems, at present, it is impossible to consider all possible combinations of relevant bases. This implies that some sort of structure-activityrelation needs to be identified to potentially lump some of the amines together as a single species when considered in cluster distribution models.As demonstrated by Table 2 there exist very few studies that actually consider the synergistic effect of different base molecules in the clusters (Kupiainen-Määttä et al., 2012;Temelso et al., 2018;Myllys et al., 2019a;Li et al., 2020b).

        <p>Unfortunately, this has to some extent also led to a pathological quest for finding the "missing" organic that promotes new particle formation. As volatile organic compounds are photo-oxidized in the atmosphere there exist a plethora of different species with varying amount of oxygen content. This implies that cluster formation studies involving organics suffer from the same general issue as amines in the sense that many different combinations of cluster compositions inevitably will exist. Table 3 outlines some of the quantum chemical studies that have involved the formation of sulfuric acid -organic clusters. For simplicity we do not list the exact compositions of the clusters, only the organic compounds and other precursor molecules which were studied. A few studies exist that have applied cluster distribution dynamics simulations to study the influence of organics. For instance, it has been indicated that small chained organic acids (lactic-, glycolic-, glyoxylic-and malonic acid) (Li et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2018a;Zhang et al., 2018a) can enhance sulfuric acid -base new particle formation rates. However, to archive a significant enhancing effect the temperature must be very low (∼ 220 K). Such low temperatures are only attainable at higher altitudes, which would inevitably lead to lower concentrations of precursor compounds compared to the ground level. Again, it should be noted that given high enough concentration and low enough temperature anything will nucleate, but this gives no information about the processes in the atmosphere. We thus recommend cautious consideration to the simulation conditions when studying the enhancing effect of organics. On the other hand, studies on very large clusters consisting of up to six sulfuric acid molecules and four tricarboxylic acids (MBTCA) molecules (Elm et al., 2017c;Elm, 2019b) have indicated that the organics form particles by themselves instead of interacting with sulfuric acid. However, this might very well be a unique feature of the MBTCA molecule and does not necessarily transfer to other multicarboxylic acids. Experimental evidence suggests that ions are crucial to induce cluster formation involving only organic compounds (Kirkby et al., 2016). However, without complete data sets that include all relevant components (sulfuric acid -bases -organics -water and ions) it remains speculative whether organics actually stabilize the initial cluster formation, or are only involved in the growth of the clusters.Unfortunately, this has to some extent also led to a pathological quest for finding the "missing" organic that promotes new particle formation.

        <p>A key reason for the unknown role of organic compounds participating in new particle formation is related to the limited structural information about the relevant compounds. A common approach has been to study compounds of anthropogenic (aromatic acids) and biogenic (isoprene, monoterpene derived acids) origin which are identified in high concentrations either in the gas-phase or particle phase. While to some extend very logical, this approach is flawed in the sense that it remains unknown at what stage a given compound enters the particle. Presently, all known organics, containing only C-, H-and O-atoms, simply bind too weakly to sulfuric acid and do not appreciably enhance the sticking of further sulfuric acid molecules to the cluster in the manner that bases do. So at any realistic concentration and temperature their effect just appears to be too small. At atmospheric relevant conditions it might very well only be a few elusive exotic organic oxidation products that can act as the initial stabilizer of the sulfuric acid clusters.A key reason for the unknown role of organic compounds participating in new particle formation is related to the limited structural information about the relevant compounds.

        <p>The potential of a given organic compound to form new particles is assumed to be linked to its saturation vapour pressure. This has sprouted the interest in atmospheric covalently bound dimers as these should have low vapour pressures given their sheer size. For instance, monoterpene (C 10 H 16 ) derived dimers can consist 19-20 carbon atoms and 11-14 oxygen atoms per dimer molecule (Ehn et al., 2014). Such large molecules have many rotational degrees of freedom, which makes quantum chemical studies of particle formation involving covalently bound organic dimers very challenging. The oxygen-to-carbon (O:C) ratio has also widely been used as a metric for the vapour pressure of organic compounds and inferred the plausibility that a given compound could be involved in particle formation. However, it has been explicitly shown that high O:C ratios cannot directly be linked to low saturation vapour pressures (Kurtén et al., 2016), the exact molecular structure i.e. available strong binding groups is more important (Elm et al., 2017b).The potential of a given organic compound to form new particles is assumed to be linked to its saturation vapour pressure.

        <p>Despite the considerable attention that organics have received, not a single compound has been identified that is capable of promoting the binding of additional sulfuric acid molecules to the clusters, which is required to enable the growth and to have a substantial effect on new particle formation. The high molecular weight and numerous available rotamers of relevant organic compounds makes it impossible to address the problem head on using a brute force approach. Thus, studies that focus on specific combinations of binding patterns of organic compounds to other cluster precursors might become a more valuable approach in the future. The most likely approach to successfully identify organic compounds that might be involved in particle formation will be a combination of identifying exotic oxidation products from gas-phase kinetic studies that bind strongly to other organics or sulfuric acid.Despite the considerable attention that organics have received, not a single compound has been identified that is capable of promoting the binding of additional sulfuric acid molecules to the clusters, which is required to enable the growth and to have a substantial effect on new particle formation.

        <p>While sulfuric acid is believed to be important for new particle formation in many inland environments, methanesulfonic acid (msa) is believed to play a role over the oceans and in coastal regions. It has been hypothesized that with forthcoming stricter regulation on SO 2 emissions, the relative concentration of methane sulfonic acid compared to sulfuric acid will increase (Perraud et al., 2015). Typical concentrations of methanesulfonic acid is of the same order as, or slightly lower than, that of sulfuric acid (Eisele and Tanner, 1993;Mauldin et al., 1999Mauldin et al., , 2003;;Berresheim et al., 2002;Bardouki et al., 2003;Yokelson et al., 2009).

        <p>It is clear that the studies involving methane sulfonic acid is clearly lacking behind compared to sulfuric acid. Only in the recent few years have cluster distribution dynamics simulations involving methane sulfonic acid been reported. In general, most studies indicate that methane sulfonic acid is a significantly worse clustering agent compared to sulfuric acid. Interestingly, the selectivity towards different bases follow a different pattern compared to sulfuric acid. For methane sulfonic acid the stabilizing effect of bases follow MA &gt; TMA ≈ DMA &gt; NH 3 (Chen et al., 2016) as opposed to sulfuric acid that follow a DMA ≈ TMA &gt; MA &gt; NH 3 pattern (Jen et al., 2014;Glasoe et al., 2015).It is clear that the studies involving methane sulfonic acid is clearly lacking behind compared to sulfuric acid.

        <p>Most studies have investigated exclusively either methane sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid, but it has been indicated that considering clusters consisting of both molecules lead to a synergetic effect (Bork et al., 2014). Thus more studies with both components and with different bases are required to fully understand the synergistic effects of msa and sa together with various bases. To the best of our knowledge there is only a single study that has looked into the potential of particle formation caused by iodic acid (ia) (Rong et al., 2020). As iodic acid might be important for new particle formation at coastal regions further studies are definitely required.Most studies have investigated exclusively either methane sulfonic acid or sulfuric acid, but it has been indicated that considering clusters consisting of both molecules lead to a synergetic effect (Bork et al., 2014).

        <p>As demonstrated in the previous sections there exist an abundance of cluster formation studies involving sulfuric/methanesulfonic acid, bases, organics and water. However, the effect of ions has been somewhat less studied and has been a subject of much debate. Studies have indicated that there is a direct link between cloud cover and cosmic rays, implying that ionic pathways might contribute to particle formation and growth processes (Svensmark and Fri-isChristensen, 1997;Marsh and Svensmark, 2000;Svensmark et al., 2007;Enghoff and Svensmark, 2008;Svensmark et al., 2009). A recent study showed that condensation of ions could contribute several percent to the growth of particles (Svensmark et al., 2017). Field measurements in the remote boreal forest have indicated that neutral pathways dominate the particle formation mechanism with ions only playing a minor role (Kulmala et al., 2007)]. There is no doubt that when the clusters are otherwise weakly bound and the concentration of precursor species is low, ions will have a large effect on the total particle formation rate (Olenius et al., 2013). Table 5 presents some of the studies that have involved ionic clusters. It should be mentioned that some of the studies listed in Tables 1-4 also address the role of ions and the Table below primarily presents the studies where ions are in focus.As demonstrated in the previous sections there exist an abundance of cluster formation studies involving sulfuric/methanesulfonic acid, bases, organics and water.

        <p>As seen from Table 5, there exist very few complete datasets that include both positive and negative ions (Olenius et al., 2013;Myllys et al., 2019b). For weakly bound systems, such as sulfuric acid -ammonia clusters and clusters consisting purely organics, ions are potentially very important for the overall formation rate. This also implies that in the pursuit of a cleaner atmosphere, with reduced emission of anthropogenic SO 2 , the relative contribution from ionic pathways might become more important in the future.As seen from Table 5, there exist very few complete datasets that include both positive and negative ions (Olenius et al., 2013;Myllys et al., 2019b).

        <p>It is clear from the previous sections there already exists a plethora of different cluster studies, and hence there is an emerging need for unified databases for storing thermochemical data to ensure easy public availability (Elm, 2019a). It is also evident that solving all possible combinations of relevant acid -base cluster systems up to 4×4 or larger grid sizes and including the effect of hydration is a formidable task and most likely not a viable option. To progress the field forward we need to be clever about which systems that are relevant to study and improve the applied algorithms used narrow down the massive number of cluster configurations. The application of machine learning techniques appears to be a natural step in the process of screening relevant cluster configurations. There is also both a need for studying cluster systems involving new compounds and at the same time expanding to larger clusters. Screening of small relevant atmospheric systems consisting of combinations of inorganic acids, polyfunctional organic acids, bases, ions and water might be a valid approach towards identifying which systems are capable of binding strong enough to be able to grow to larger sizes. Once again, we stress that for a system to be relevant for new particle formation it not only has to be "stable" with respect to evaporation, but also has to enable the further growth into larger sizes. Such screening procedures would allow for the potential to lump several different chemical species with similar properties as a single entity in cluster distribution dynamics models.It is clear from the previous sections there already exists a plethora of different cluster studies, and hence there is an emerging need for unified databases for storing thermochemical data to ensure easy public availability (Elm, 2019a).

        <p>In general, we anticipate that both the quantity and quality of input thermochemistry based on quantum chemical data will improve. This includes both the calculated free energies, and to extension the evaporation rates, but also other input parameters such as the collision rates. For modelling realistic atmospheric conditions there is a need for further quantifying the magnitude of sinks/losses, as shown in Figure 6 the effect of losses can easily be similar to that of the uncertainties in the calculated Δ -values for low vapour concentrations.In general, we anticipate that both the quantity and quality of input thermochemistry based on quantum chemical data will improve.

        <p>Establishing knowledge of which cluster systems that can be regarded as stable and grow, will make it possible to study reactive uptake of volatile organic species on small clusters/particles. This will allow the possibility to study the early growth behaviour where explicit knowledge is severely lacking. In this regard multi-scale modelling will most likely be useful, where the important part (or "active site") of the large cluster/particle is described with QM methods, while the environment is described at a simpler level of theory.Establishing knowledge of which cluster systems that can be regarded as stable and grow, will make it possible to study reactive uptake of volatile organic species on small clusters/particles.

        <p>Obtaining the free energy profile of cluster growth from single molecules to small clusters to ∼2 nm particles will allow the identification of the transition from the cluster regime (discrete QM thermodynamics) to the bulk particle regime (continuum thermodynamics). Promising work in this aspect is underway, for example by connecting sectional models to cluster distribution dynamics which allows not only for the formation rates to be simulated, but also the full size distribution and growth rate (Kürten et al., 2018;Kürten, 2019;Carlsson et al., 2020). However, it remains difficult to obtain highly accurate thermochemistry from quantum chemical calculations when studying clusters larger than 10 molecules. Thus, new approaches or development of cost-efficient methodologies are required to effectively bridge the gap between discrete and continuum thermodynamics.Obtaining the free energy profile of cluster growth from single molecules to small clusters to ∼2 nm particles will allow the identification of the transition from the cluster regime (discrete QM thermodynamics) to the bulk particle regime (continuum thermodynamics).

        <p>Without the accessibility of accurate methods for modelling of large liquid particles COnductor-like Screening MOdels (COSMO ℎ (COSMO)) appears to be a possible intermediate step to obtain bulk thermochemical properties using quantum chemical methods for complex mixtures of compounds where experimental data is lacking (Wang et al., 2015). While restricted to bulk thermodynamics, COSMO-type calculations can predict many bulk properties of complex molecules in multicomponent mixtures. This implies that not only pure compound saturation vapour pressures ( sat ) can be calculated, but also Setschenow constants, solubilities and activity coefficients in any solvent environment, including both water and water-insoluble organic matter (Toivola et al., 2017;Kurtén et al., 2018;Hyttinen et al., 2020). However, presently the error margins appears to be quite large.Without the accessibility of accurate methods for modelling of large liquid particles COnductor-like Screening MOdels (COSMO ℎ (COSMO)) appears to be a possible intermediate step to obtain bulk thermochemical properties using quantum chemical methods for complex mixtures of compounds where experimental data is lacking (Wang et al., 2015).

        <p>When studying larger clusters the assumption that the structures remain crystal-like might not be valid anymore. To address this issue would require sophisticated molecular dynamics simulations to adequately describe the cluster, but current methods are too computationally expensive to allow the long simulation time it would take to equilibrate a large cluster. Potentially, molecular dynamics simulations using semi-empirical quantum chemical methods might be a valid option for studying relatively large systems, while maintaining an adequate accuracy.When studying larger clusters the assumption that the structures remain crystal-like might not be valid anymore.

        <p>Recently, Roldin et al. (Roldin et al., 2019) coupled a cluster distribution dynamics model with chemical transport model to study the boreal forest aerosol-cloud-climate system. This allowed, for the first time, the explicit inclusion of particle formation based on quantum chemical data in the model instead of simple paramerizations. Hence, there is a general need for more accurate and complete thermochemical dataset based quantum chemistry to further improve the description of particle formation in chemical transport models in various regions.Recently, Roldin et al.

        <p>However, at typic atmospheric conditions and concentrations of sulfuric acid (10 5 -10 8 molecules cm -3 ) and ammonia (up to ppb level) the observed new particle formation rates in different regions worldwide cannot fully be explained by a sulfuic acid -ammonia -water mechanism. The work by Kurtén et al. (Kurtén et al., 2008) showed that amines might be an even more potent source to new particle formation compared to ammonia even when considering that amine concentrations (1-10 ppt) most likely are orders magnitudes lower than ammonia. From a purely acid -base chemistry point of view this makes sense as amines are stronger bases, and hence the interaction with sulfuric acid will be stronger.However, at typic atmospheric conditions and concentrations of sulfuric acid (10 5 -10 8 molecules cm -3 ) and ammonia (up to ppb level) the observed new particle formation rates in different regions worldwide cannot fully be explained by a sulfuic acid -ammonia -water mechanism.

This is caused by the observation that organics, such as highly oxygenated autoxidation products, generally bind too weakly to sulfuric acid and do not enhance the attachment of additional sulfuric acid molecules (Elm et al., 2015). This implies that the addition of organics to a cluster consisting of sulfuric acid and bases is not able to compete with the corresponding uptake of another sulfuric acid molecule, even at a high loading of organic compounds (Elm et al., 2016b). The most likely organics to be involved in cluster formation are multicarboxylic acids. Elm et al. (Elm et al., 2017b) showed that the direct interaction between sulfuric acid and various carboxylic acids (i.e forming two sets of hydrogen bonds) were more or less independent of the carbon backbone of the carboxylic acid with a Δ -value close to -6 kcal/mol for all acids. Stronger binding was only possible if additional hydrogen bonds were possible between the sulfuric acid and organic acid. A recent study by Li et al.
