        <p>Chemical looping combustion of biomass-sourced fuels (bio-CLC) is a novel bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology for power and heat generation with net negative CO 2 emissions. In this study, a new 10 kW th CLC pilot designed for high-volatiles biomass fuels was commissioned with ilmenite oxygen carrier and five different biomass fuels of varying volatile and alkali content fractions. The system was tested for its ability to convert high and low volatile content biomass, while achieving high carbon capture efficiency. The new pilot achieved carbon capture close to 100% for high-volatiles biomass, and &gt;94% for low-volatiles biomass char fuels. Furthermore, due to the implementation of a volatiles distributor, the new pilot demonstrated an improvement of up to 10 percentage points of gas conversion efficiency for high-volatiles biomass vs. the previous generation reactor. Gaseous alkali emissions were measured with a surface ionization detection system. Flue gas alkali release levels were found to rise with higher fuel alkali content. Alkali emissions were found to be approximately similar in the AR and the FR for all but the straw pellet mixture fuel (highest alkali content fuel). For the straw pellet mixture, gaseous alkali release levels in the AR were up to seven times higher than those of the FR. In all cases, over 96% of the fuel's alkalis were absorbed by the ilmenite bed material. Ilmenite's strong alkali absorption characteristics were concluded to be the key determinant of gas-phase release of biomass alkali in the conducted experiments.Chemical looping combustion of biomass-sourced fuels (bio-CLC) is a novel bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology for power and heat generation with net negative CO 2 emissions.

        <p>Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is promising thermal fuel conversion technology that allows low-cost and low-energy-penalty integrated carbon capture [1]. The principle of CLC is shown in Fig. 1 and consists of cyclical oxidation and reduction of a metal oxide material, the oxygen carrier (OC), circulated through two-interconnected reactors. The metal oxide is reduced by fuel in the fuel reactor (FR) and oxidized by air in an air rector (AR). In this process scheme, oxygen is transferred by the OC from the air in the AR to the fuel in FR, while nitrogen is rejected in the AR. Thus, fuel in the FR is converted with pure oxygen, resulting in a nitrogen-free flue gas. This avoids the costly separation of CO 2 from nitrogen that is required in post-combustion CO 2 capture systems. A more complete overview of the CLC process is described in several review publications [2][3][4][5][6].Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is promising thermal fuel conversion technology that allows low-cost and low-energy-penalty integrated carbon capture [1].

        <p>Until the early 2000 ′ s CLC was largely a paper concept, until the first successful pilot-scale demonstration of the process in 2004 [7]. Since then the field of chemical looping has grown, with multiple research teams addressing process optimization, oxygen carrier material screening and development, thermodynamic and kinetics studies of the process, as well as the adoption of the CLC principle for development of novel related technologies such as chemical looping reforming, chemical looping gasification, oxygen carrier aided combustion, and others [4,8,9]. The technology readiness level (TRL) of chemical looping combustion technology is currently at TRL6 [10]. Pilot work remains the ultimate test for the study, development, and validation of the CLC process. Since the first demonstration of CLC technology, at least 46 CLC pilot rectors have been successfully constructed and operated with gaseous, liquid, and solid fuels [11].Until the early 2000 ′ s CLC was largely a paper concept, until the first successful pilot-scale demonstration of the process in 2004 [7].

        <p>In recent years, the use of biomass as fuel in CLC (bio-CLC) has been of great interest. Bio-CLC is a bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology that allows for a net negative CO 2 emissions impact. Since negative emissions technologies (NETs) are deemed necessary for achieving ambitious CO 2 emissions reduction targets, as indicated in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [12], development of bio-CLC is highly relevant. Although CLC with solid fuels has been demonstrated in various pilots using fossil-derived fuels, CLC of biomass remains a relatively unexplored area of the CLC suite of technologies. In a recent review by Lyngfelt et al. [11], of the 22 pilot CLC systems capable of using solid fuels, less than half of the pilot systems have been operated using biomass. For most of these units, the original design was developed for general solid fuel capability, with coal as the basis fuel. Although such units are capable of operation with biomass, their design is not optimal for the relatively high volatile content of biomass fuels.In recent years, the use of biomass as fuel in CLC (bio-CLC) has been of great interest.

        <p>The aim of this study was to commission and establish performance benchmarks of a new 10 kW th CLC pilot designed specifically for conversion of high-volatiles fuels such as biomass. Furthermore, this study aimed to develop the understanding of how alkalis that are found in higher proportion in biomass fuels will influence the CLC process. In conventional fluidized bed combustion of biomass, alkalis are wellknown to cause corrosion and fouling of heat exchange equipment and agglomeration of the bed material. The behavior of alkali release and how alkalis influence the CLC process remains largely unexplored. The determination of this behavior is integral to development of bio-CLC systems and is addressed in this study.The aim of this study was to commission and establish performance benchmarks of a new 10 kW th CLC pilot designed specifically for conversion of high-volatiles fuels such as biomass.

        <p>Design of CLC pilot systems for solid fuel conversion must address several unique challenges not encountered in CLC of gaseous fuels. The main difference is that solid fuels undergo rapid devolatilization, leaving behind solid char. While devolatilized species can react upon contact with the OC, the char must first be gasified by steam or CO 2 in order to form gasification products that can react upon contact with the OC. Fuel composition plays a large role here. Solid fossil fuels, such as coal and coke, typically have a relatively low volatiles content, but high char content, as compared to biomass. For such fuels, char gasification is the rate-limiting step in the overall fuel conversion process [6,13]. To achieve high char conversion and to prevent loss of char to the AR, the pilot system must maximize char contact with steam and the OC. The OC circulation rate and the FR inventory control the OC residence time in the FR. The OC residence time, in-turn, affects char residence time, and thus directly influences char conversion. However, OC circulation is constrained by the energy balance and FR inventory is subject to practical limitations. Given these constraints, another option to influence char conversion is to reduce the fuel size. For a given OC residence time, smaller fuel particles improve char conversion. For example, an optimum size for coal fuel is in the size range of 100-300 µm [6]. Reduction of the fuel size also has limitations as particles that are too small can be stripped by the fluidizing gas and carried away unconverted with the FR flue gas. To limit char elutriation, some pilot unit designs have opted to add a char separation loop, called a carbon stripper, to the FR. The purpose of a carbon stripper is to separate char from the OC leaving the FR and recirculate it back to the FR for further conversion.Design of CLC pilot systems for solid fuel conversion must address several unique challenges not encountered in CLC of gaseous fuels.

        <p>Biomass fuels behave differently from solid fossil-derived solid fuels. Depending on the type, biomass fuels typically have a volatile content of 60-85 wt% [14]. The high proportion of volatiles and the quick nature of devolatilization results in suboptimal contact of the volatiles with the OC. This results in incomplete conversion. Complete conversion requires post-injection of oxygen to the FR flue gas in order to complete the oxidation. To improve the contact between volatiles and the OC, fuel feeding into the bottom of the FR bed is preferred. Oxygen carriers capable of releasing free oxygen in the FR have also been used. Use of such oxygen carriers is classified as a subset of chemical looping technology, termed chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU). The oxygen release from CLOU oxygen carrier enhances conversion, as some free oxygen is available for oxidation of unconverted volatiles in the freeboard of the FR. Nevertheless, typical gas conversion efficiency reported for bio-CLC reactor operation are below 80%, and improvement of gas conversion efficiency is pursued with testing of alternative oxygen carriers or with new CLC pilot designs.Biomass fuels behave differently from solid fossil-derived solid fuels.

        <p>Further to influencing conversion, the high volatiles fraction of biomass fuels means that the char content of biomass is significantly lower than that of fossil-derived solid fuels. Biomass char is more reactive than that of fossil fuel char, and thus easier to gasify. The increased reactivity of biochar is attributed to the alkali content of biomass and biochar's increased porosity and surface area, when compared to char originating from fossil-derived solid fuels. Alkali, K and Na, are known catalysts for char gasification [15]. The increased porosity and active surface area also improve gasification, since char gasification depends on surface reactions [16][17][18]. The lower relative amount and higher reactivity of biomass char alleviates the design challenge encountered with fossil-derived fuels in CLC, leaving the issue of volatiles conversion as the primary reactor design issue.Further to influencing conversion, the high volatiles fraction of biomass fuels means that the char content of biomass is significantly lower than that of fossil-derived solid fuels.

        <p>The first CLC reactor for solid fuels was designed and commissioned by Berguerand and Lyngfelt in 2008 at Chalmers University of Technology and is described in detail in [19]. From 2011, results from other solid-fuel-capable reactors began to appear in published literature. Most of these designs use a high-velocity riser AR and either a bubbling bed or a high velocity riser as the FR. Most of these CLC pilots were designed for general solid fuel conversion with coal as the basis fuel. Operational experience from the original Chalmers 10 kW solid fuels reactor as well as published results from other solid fuel CLC pilot units confirms that the primary challenge in bio-CLC is poor volatiles conversion.The first CLC reactor for solid fuels was designed and commissioned by Berguerand and Lyngfelt in 2008 at Chalmers University of Technology and is described in detail in [19].

        <p>Another key consideration for designing a pilot system for biomass CLC is the release of alkali during fuel conversion. Compared to fossilbased solid fuels, biomass typically has less ash, but can contain higher levels of alkalis (Na and K), as they are essential nutrients for plant growth [14]. In conventional combustion of biomass in boilers, alkalis are known to cause severe issues in for heat exchange surfaces, as well as in the boiler bed. Alkalis are released to the gas phase at temperatures above 700 • C. The release is primarily facilitated by Cl through formation of highly volatile KCl and NaCl salts that cause fouling and corrosion of the heat exchange equipment [16,20]. Alkali species can also be retained in the ash fraction of the bed, where they can react to form potassium and sodium silicates. At process conditions, these species form sticky melts that initiate agglomeration of bed material.Another key consideration for designing a pilot system for biomass CLC is the release of alkali during fuel conversion.

        <p>In CLC, the fate of alkali release is largely unknown. Several studies have reported observations of interaction of biomass alkali with oxygen carriers. In a 1 kW pilot CLC study with wood saw dust fuel and iron oxygen carrier, Gu et al. found that alkalis form deposits on the OC but do not affect its reactivity [21]. In similar experiments in a 500 W CLC pilot, Mendiara et al. found no deposition or effect on reactivity of the iron ore OC [22]. In experiments with ilmenite, the most common OC for solid fuels, Corcoran et al. has shown that ilmenite absorbs alkali, thus limiting the release to the gas phase, as well as preventing formation of alkali silicates [23]. To date, literature mentions only one study that has reported alkali gas phase release measurements in CLC [24].In CLC, the fate of alkali release is largely unknown.

The vertical fuel chute leads the fuel to the bottom section of the FR, where the fuel mixes with the bed material. To aid the feeding process, nitrogen sweep gas is supplied to the lid of the fuel hopper and to the top of the fuel chute.The solid fuel injection system from the first generation reactor was re-used in the present design.

        <p>The idea behind the volatiles distributor is to optimize contact between biomass volatiles and the oxygen carrier. Experience with biomass fuels shows that devolatilization is a fast process. It is expected that as soon as biomass fuel is introduced into the fuel chute, it would heat up and start to devolatilize. Since the steam fluidizing velocity is several times higher than the OC minimum fluidization velocity, the additional volatile release would tend to pass though the bed as large bubbles, thus avoiding much of the close contact with the OC that is needed for conversion. The volatiles distributor is essentially a perforated internal baffle which separates much of the volatiles flow into multiple streams, thus increasing contact with the OC bed. It should be noted that the center section of the volatiles distributor remains open, such as not to impede fluidization and OC circulation in the FR.The idea behind the volatiles distributor is to optimize contact between biomass volatiles and the oxygen carrier.

        <p>New 10 kW solid fuels CLC system key operating parameters. From the Dekati® diluter, the diluted sample is split up through a manifold between a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS -TSI 3082 &amp; CPC 3750), the surface ionization detector (SID), a CO 2 analyzer (LICOR LI-850), a trace oxygen analyzer (Alpha Omega Instruments 3000-Y230BTP), and a vent line for excess sample flow. The SID was custom built for this reactor and is the main measurement component that detects total flue gas alkali concentration using the principle of surface ionization. The SID principle has been successfully used to measure alkali emissions in conventional combustion [33], gasification [34], and tested in a previous campaign on the Chalmers 100 kW CLC reactor [24]. A comprehensive overview of the SID's working principles is described in several publications [35,36]. The trace CO 2 analyzer is used to track overall dilution of the sample when measuring alkali in the FR flue gas. Since the FR raw flue gas CO 2 concentration is measured by the main process gas analyzers, the dilution ratio can be calculated by dividing the raw flue gas CO 2 concentration by the CO 2 concentration of the diluted sample. The dilution ratio is then used to recalculate the raw flue gas alkali concentration from the diluted sample alkali concentration measured by the SID. When measuring alkali levels in the AR flue gas, oxygen is used to track dilution. The undiluted AR flue gas oxygen concentration is measured by the main process gas analyzers, while oxygen in the diluted sample is measured by the trace oxygen analyzer. The SMPS system measures the concentration and distribution of particles in the diluted sample in the range of approx. 10-700 nm. It is primarily used for calibration of the SID. The SID is calibrated with a 0.005 M KCl (aq) solution. An aerosol generator uses the calibration solution to create fine aqueous KCl aerosol. This aerosol is dried in a diffusion dryer to precipitate solid KCl particles in the size range of approx. 10-600 nm. The calibration aerosol flow is then split between the SMPS system and the SID. The mass concentration of the KCl particles is calculated by the SMPS and compared to the SID output signal in order to create a calibration curve. SID instrument calibration for this campaign was performed at the beginning as well as after campaign completion. Deviation between the calibration results indicated that the SID instrument had an approximate measurement drift of up to + 1.5% per hour of operation. Although the SID's signal drift is not the only source of source of measurement uncertainty, the performance of the instrument was deemed acceptable for the comparison of time-averaged values utilized in the results and discussion sections.New 10 kW solid fuels CLC system key operating parameters. From the Dekati® diluter, the diluted sample is split up through a manifold between a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS -TSI 3082 &amp; CPC 3750), the surface ionization detector (SID), a CO 2 analyzer (LICOR LI-850), a trace oxygen analyzer (Alpha Omega Instruments 3000-Y230BTP), and a vent line for excess sample flow. The SID was custom built for this reactor and is the main measurement component that detects total flue gas alkali concentration using the principle of surface ionization. The SID principle has been successfully used to measure alkali emissions in conventional combustion [33], gasification [34], and tested in a previous campaign on the Chalmers 100 kW CLC reactor [24]. A comprehensive overview of the SID's working principles is described in several publications [35,36]. The trace CO 2 analyzer is used to track overall dilution of the sample when measuring alkali in the FR flue gas. Since the FR raw flue gas CO 2 concentration is measured by the main process gas analyzers, the dilution ratio can be calculated by dividing the raw flue gas CO 2 concentration by the CO 2 concentration of the diluted sample. The dilution ratio is then used to recalculate the raw flue gas alkali concentration from the diluted sample alkali concentration measured by the SID.

        <p>In addition to the alkali emissions measurement system described in Section 3.3, the key analytical methods employed in the study consist of reactor flue gas analysis. Gas composition for the AR and FR was determined by multicomponent gas analyzers. During operation, FR flue gas is continuously sampled from the FR chimney. The sample gas is first passed through a water-cooled condenser to reject majority of the water. The gas is then filtered to remove oxygen carrier fines. The cleaned gas is conveyed to a gas-conditioning system for further filtration and residual water removal. The conditioned gas then follows to a multicomponent gas analyzer. The AR gas is sampled directly from the AR chimney and then undergoes the same treatment sequence as the FR flue gas, but without the first condenser step. A primary condenser is not required as the water content of AR gas is much lower than that of the FR. The gas analyzers, gas-conditioning systems, the gases measured, and the measurement uncertainties are summarized in Table 3.In addition to the alkali emissions measurement system described in Section 3.3, the key analytical methods employed in the study consist of reactor flue gas analysis.

        <p>It should be noted that within this commissioning campaign, significant operational upsets were experienced during two tests with SWC and GWC fuels due to excessive backpressure in the FR chimney. It was found that the backpressure was caused by unconverted wood char being carried into the FR chimney and setting on the chimney walls. Significant amounts of wood char were found in the FR water seal and in the material removed during subsequent FR chimney cleaning. Wood char was also found in the AR filters, confirming that once significant back pressure developed in the FR chimney, disbalance in pressure between the AR and FR caused one or both of the loop seals to blow out, allowing char to be carried over into the AR and then to the AR chimney and AR filters. Results from these tests were omitted.It should be noted that within this commissioning campaign, significant operational upsets were experienced during two tests with SWC and GWC fuels due to excessive backpressure in the FR chimney.

        <p>AR and FR flue gas alkali measurement was conducted throughout the commissioning campaign. Collection of alkali measurements proved to be challenging primarily due to the difficulty of maintaining a stable sampling dilution ratio. When sampling, the dilution ratio was manipulated by setting the 1st and 2nd stage dilution nitrogen flow. The dilution at the third stage diluter was fixed at 8:1. The stability of the overall dilution ratio was monitored from the trace CO 2 (when sampling the FR) and trace O 2 measurements (when sampling the AR) of the diluted sample. During measurement, the trace CO 2 and O 2 measurements declined over time, indicating that the raw sample suction flow was decreasing. The likely cause of this was gradual plugging of the sampling probes with the OC fines present in the exhaust flow. This issue was mitigated by periodically backflushing the probes with nitrogen. This method proved to be effective, but temporarily affected the alkali data collection. During data processing, alkali measurements affected by probe back flushing and cleaning of the main gas analyzer system were mostly excluded.

        <p>The first operational learning for the new 10 kW reactor was established during initial tests with BP fuel. Fig. 5 shows selected operating and performance parameters for sub-tests BP 1 through BP 7. These tests indicate that a minimum system OC inventory of approx. 22 kg of OC is required before effective circulation of the system can be achieved. The lack of inventory was evident from the fact that oxygen demand for black pellets is high and increases as reactor inventory decreases. This indicates that delivery of oxygen in the form of oxidized OC circulated to the FR is quite low. When fresh material is added to the FR, at 56 min and 183 min, a step decrease in oxygen demand is observed, indicating the onset of effective circulation of oxidized OC into the FR. This is corroborated by the O 2 concentration of the AR. AR O 2 levels are generally high, indicating that very little reduced OC is overflowing from the FR. When inventory is topped off, the AR O 2 concentration drops, increased transfer of reduced OC to the AR. Fig. 6 shows the inventory levels of the AR bottom section and the AR riser for the tests. The figure clearly shows that the AR bottom section needs to accumulate more than approx. 5 kg of ilmenite, prior to any significant level of inventory appearing in the AR riser section. The onset of inventory in the AR riser signifies the onset of effective global OC circulation within the system.The first operational learning for the new 10 kW reactor was established during initial tests with BP fuel.

For example, it was found that during the first campaign day, which included almost 4 h of fueled operation and approximately 1.5 h of unfueled circulation in hot conditions, 5.1 kg of OC material were carried over and settled in the FR chimney and the FR water seal. This level of elutriation was observed for the remainder of the campaign.In Fig. 7, the effect of insufficient circulation to the FR can be clearly seen as CO and H 2 levels increase and CO 2 levels fall in periods corresponding to a decrease in system inventory.

Although, not included in the benchmarking data, German wood char operation had carbon efficiencies of 68.2 and 91.7%. The lower carbon capture efficiency of the char fuels can be explained by the fact that the wood chars have non-volatile fraction of approx. 85%, vs. the 15-20% non-volatile content of straw, black pellets, and pine forest residue fuels. The higher char fraction increases the probability of unconverted char carry-over to the AR.

        <p>The previous generation 10 kW solid fuels reactor was equipped with a carbon stripper designed to recirculate char at the FR outlet back to the FR inlet. The carbon stripper was meant to increase the char's residence time in the FR and improve its conversion, thus decreasing char breakthrough to the AR [40]. As summarized in Table 9, carbon capture efficiency of the previous generation unit was reported in the range of 96-99 % for German wood char [31], 76-97% for Swedish wood char [29][30][31][32], and 87-100% for black pellets [31,32]. The current unit was designed without a carbon stripper but was able to achieve carbon capture efficiencies like those of the previous unit, thus suggesting that high carbon capture efficiency is achievable without the need for a carbon stripper, when the reactor is operated with biomass fuels. However, the case may be different for solid fossil-derived fuels such as coal and petcoke. Fossil-derived solid fuel char is well-known to be less reactive than biomass char [15].The previous generation 10 kW solid fuels reactor was equipped with a carbon stripper designed to recirculate char at the FR outlet back to the FR inlet.

As summarized in Table 9, carbon capture efficiency of the previous generation unit was reported in the range of 96-99 % for German wood char [31], 76-97% for Swedish wood char [29][30][31][32], and 87-100% for black pellets [31,32]. The current unit was designed without a carbon stripper but was able to achieve carbon capture efficiencies like those of the previous unit, thus suggesting that high carbon capture efficiency is achievable without the need for a carbon stripper, when the reactor is operated with biomass fuels. However, the case may be different for solid fossil-derived fuels such as coal and petcoke. Fossil-derived solid fuel char is well-known to be less reactive than biomass char [15].</p>
        <p>The oxygen demand demonstrated by the new system ranges from 4.9 to 25.5%. Here, the main difference in oxygen demand is again related to the fuel's composition. For straw, black pellets, and pine forest residue, up to 75% of the fuel mass, the volatiles fraction, is quickly devolatilized. This fast release limits the contact time between the volatiles and the OC in the FR bed, resulting in only partial conversion of the volatiles. For the char fuels, release of most of the fuel's combustible content is limited by the char gasification rate, giving time for the fuel particles to mix well with the bed material. Thus, the gradual release of the gasification products results in better contact between the reactive gaseous species and the OC particles, enabling higher gas conversion efficiency.The oxygen demand demonstrated by the new system ranges from 4.9 to 25.5%.

        <p>In Table 10, fuels are ordered top to bottom in order of increasing oxygen demand. Each fuel's volatiles content is also reported. The operational data presented in Table 10 clearly shows a dramatic rise in oxygen demand with increasing volatiles content. There are two deviations to this trend. The largest one is that petcoke, despite having lower volatiles content, has a higher oxygen demand than SWC and GWC fuels. The explanation for this deviation can likely be related to fuel reactivities. Oxygen demand is essentially the degree of incomplete oxidation of the reactive gases released in fuel conversion. These gases consist of the fuel's volatiles and the syngas released from fuel char gasification. It is well known that volatile species are a lot less reactive than syngas. As such, reactive gasses with a higher volatiles-to-syngas ratio are less reactive and yield a higher oxygen demand. Petcoke char is known to be a lot less reactive than the biochar found in SWC and GWC fuels, resulting in a large proportion of the char leaving the FR unconverted. The reactive gases released in petcoke conversion are likely very rich in volatiles and result in an overall higher oxygen demand vs. the reactive gases higher in syngas proportion released in SWC and GWC fuel conversion. Furthermore, the volatile species found in biomass fuels are potentially more reactive than those in fossil-based fuels such as petcoke. The second deviation to the overall trend is that SWC performs slightly better than GWC, despite a lower volatiles content. This could be explained by the smaller particle size of the SWC fuel used in those studies. This effect was clearly shown when particle size of GWC fuel was varied [43].In Table 10, fuels are ordered top to bottom in order of increasing oxygen demand.

        <p>Another trend noticeable from the presented data is that oxygen demands are generally lower for manganese ores as compared to ilmenite. This is evident from comparing the oxygen demand of Columbian Coal with Ilmenite relative to two Mn ores in 100 kW unit and comparing the oxygen demand of petcoke with Ilmenite to that of the Sinfin Mn ore in the 10 kW unit. Finally, the presented data also suggests that results from the 100 kW unit generally give lower oxygen demand. This is seen comparing BP and GWC fuels using Sibelco Calcined Mn ore.Another trend noticeable from the presented data is that oxygen demands are generally lower for manganese ores as compared to ilmenite.

        <p>The average demand of 21.5% reported for the new 10 KW leads to a conclusion that the new 10 kW shows a significant performance improvement over the previous version of the 10 kW CLC pilot. This improvement can likely be attributed to the use of the volatiles distributor, but unfortunately could not be directly evaluated in this study.The average demand of 21.5% reported for the new 10 KW leads to a conclusion that the new 10 kW shows a significant performance improvement over the previous version of the 10 kW CLC pilot.

        <p>Further to capturing the general performance level of the new 10 kW CLC pilot, the influence of OC circulation was investigated. From the first tests conducted in this study, it was already established that OC circulation only starts to develop when the AR bottom section inventory exceeds approximately 5 kg. Higher circulation can be achieved with further inventory increase or with higher AR air flow rate. The effect of circulation on conversion is captured in Fig. 10, where gas conversion efficiency is plotted against specific circulation index (circulation index divided by fuel input power).Further to capturing the general performance level of the new 10 kW CLC pilot, the influence of OC circulation was investigated.

        <p>For the high-volatiles fuels, Fig. 10 shows that higher circulation (CI/ P fuel ) results in higher gas conversion efficiency. There are several reasons for this. First, higher circulation simply increases the relative amount of oxygen input available for contact with the gaseous components of the fuel. Secondly, higher OC circulation results in lower OC conversion, which has two beneficial effects on fuel conversion. The kinetics of ilmenite reduction (fuel conversion) are known to be faster at low OC conversions. Also, since the overall FR process is endothermic, lower ilmenite conversion limits temperature decrease in the FR, keeping reaction kinetics fast [45].For the high-volatiles fuels, Fig. 10 shows that higher circulation (CI/ P fuel ) results in higher gas conversion efficiency.

        <p>It is worth noting that the data points for the two char fuels show an overall higher gas conversion efficiency vs. volatile fuels and lower dependency on the OC circulation rate. This can be explained by the fact that reactive gases released in conversion of the SWC and GWC fuels are composed mostly of highly-reactive syngas, the product of char gasification. For the high-volatiles fuels (BP, PFR, SPM) the reactive gases are dominated by less reactive volatile species. Furthermore, the release of the syngas from the SWC and GWC fuels is gasification-controlled, and thus more gradual than the fast release of volatiles of the high-volatiles fuels. The gradual release of syngas results in better contact with the oxygen carrier than can be expected to occur between the volatiles and the oxygen carrier.It is worth noting that the data points for the two char fuels show an overall higher gas conversion efficiency vs. volatile fuels and lower dependency on the OC circulation rate.

        <p>Alkali emissions measurement proved to be quite challenging due to instability of sampling that was suspected to occur due to ingress of solid particles into the alkali sampling probe during testing. Fig. 11 shows SID alkali measurements for the SPM fuel tests. The extreme peaks in the signal correspond to a manual change in dilution settings. The missing data is a result of rejecting data in the data processing stage due to measurement instability. The collected alkali emissions data set presented in Table 7 represents the most comprehensive survey of alkali emissions in CLC at the time of publication. The only other previously reported results were conducted in an earlier study performed on the Chalmers 100 kW CLC pilot system [24], but presented very limited data on the alkali release levels of the AR. This was largely due to the inability to accurately track AR sample dilution during measurement. Since this earlier study, the measurement methodology was enhanced with the ability to track AR sample dilution through measurement of raw and diluted O 2 concentration of the AR sample. This improvement was implemented in this study and represents a significant step forward with respect to AR alkali measurement validity. To make the discussion of the alkali results easier, Table 11 shows a summary of the average alkali results.Alkali emissions measurement proved to be quite challenging due to instability of sampling that was suspected to occur due to ingress of solid particles into the alkali sampling probe during testing.

        <p>Table 11 reveals a few trends. Increase of the fuel's alkali content seems to result in higher alkali release in the FR. This effect, however, is not strictly proportional. For example, a 11-fold increase of alkali input that comes from switching fuel from BP to SPM, results in only a 5-fold increase in FR alkali emissions. Surprisingly, increase in alkali input rates, seems to have little to no effect on the AR alkali emissions levels. In fact, AR alkali emission of BP, PFR and SPM fuels are roughly equivalent despite the progressively higher alkali content of these fuels.Table 11 reveals a few trends.

        <p>On a relative basis, for all fuels, experimental data shows that over 97% of the alkali introduced into the reactor with the fuels, are retained in the reactor system. It is expected that the majority of this retention can be attributed to retention by the bed material, as ilmenite is wellknown to be effective at absorbing alkali thorough formation of alkali titanates [23,23]. This is consistent with the 98% retention rate reported for the 100 kW CLC unit when operated with a mixture of synthetic perovskite and ilmenite as the oxygen carrier [24]. To confirm alkali retention by Ilmenite, the OC alkali retention was also calculated as per Eq. ( 7), using OC solids samples collected before and after fueled operation on the last campaign day. This period captures the SPM fuel test and an unreported GWC fuel test (unreported due to operational upset during this test). The calculation is presented in Table 12.On a relative basis, for all fuels, experimental data shows that over 97% of the alkali introduced into the reactor with the fuels, are retained in the reactor system.

        <p>Comparison of the relative AR and FR alkali release rates shows that for BP and PFR fuel, roughly equivalent mass amounts of alkali are released both in the FR and AR flue gases. The measured concentration of alkali in the FR flue gas is much higher, but this is compensated by the fact that the AR gas flow rate is approximately 4 to 10 times higher than that of the FR. The results for BP fuel are roughly consistent with those reported for the 100 kW CLC unit fueled with BP fuel [24]. In both cases, the AR and FR release is below 2% of total incoming alkali, and the rough magnitude of the percent release in each reactor is roughly equivalent. The SPM fuel shows different behavior. On average, 0.98% of alkali are released to the FR, but only 0.14% of the incoming alkali are released in the AR. The seven-fold release of alkali in the FR is closer to the expected behavior, as the fuel is converted in the FR. For all cases, alkali release behavior is dominated by alkali absorption by ilmenite. It is possible that removing ilmenite's strong alkali absorption effect, by using an oxygen carrier with low affinity for alkalis, may reveal a completely different partitioning of alkalis between the AR and FR.Comparison of the relative AR and FR alkali release rates shows that for BP and PFR fuel, roughly equivalent mass amounts of alkali are released both in the FR and AR flue gases.

        <p>Beyond the alkali release partitioning findings discussed above, a significant data analysis effort was made in finding possible relationships between reactor operating parameters and the measured alkali concentration. The primary investigated parameters were the system OC inventory, system circulation, and the oxygen demand. However, no clear dependencies were observed, suggesting that Ilmenite's strong affinity for alkali and the fuel alkali content are the primary determinants of alkali emissions.Beyond the alkali release partitioning findings discussed above, a significant data analysis effort was made in finding possible relationships between reactor operating parameters and the measured alkali concentration.
