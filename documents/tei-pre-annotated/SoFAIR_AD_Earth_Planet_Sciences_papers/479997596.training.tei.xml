        <p>The proposal of new technologies capable of producing electrical energy from renewable sources has driven research into seas and oceans. Research finds this field very promising in the future of renewable energies, especially in areas where there are specific climatic and morphological characteristics to exploit large amounts of energy from the sea. In general, this kind of energy is referred to as six energy resources: waves, tidal range, tidal current, ocean current, ocean thermal energy conversion, and saline gradient. This review has the aim to list several wave-energy converter power plants and to analyze their years of operation. In this way, a focus is created to understand how many wave-energy converter plants work on average and whether it is indeed an established technology.</p>
        <p>This review is focused on the exploitation of sea wave energy. However, this is just one of the several kinds of energy, related to the oceanic environment, thus a brief description of the main sea energy resources is necessary [1,2].</p>
        <p>Oceans represent an enormous energy reserve that is distributed in different phenomena. Among these, the main kinds of energies related to the oceans are marine currents, osmotic salinity, OTEC (acronym of Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion), tide, and sea wave.</p>
        <p>Each oceanic energy source has a relevant potential for human applications; however, as shown in Table 1, sea waves and marine currents have the highest energy potentials [3].</p>
        <p>Table 1. Potential installable capacity and energy production from marine energy sources [3]. All these oceanic energy sources are classified as renewable [4]. Indeed, tides are due to the Moon's orbit around the Earth, the orbit of this one around the sun, and the Earth's rotation. As consequence, a huge amount of seawater flows around the world's surface, modifying locally the sea level. The effects are locally different due to the irregular distribution of lands around the world. In any case, the tides are a regular phenomenon, whose effects can be accurately predicted. Thus, tides represent an interesting renewable energy source, allowing the exploitation of tidal streams or tidal ranges. The second one has few applications worldwide, since this phenomenon allows the installation of the power plant close to the coastline, realizing a barrier equipped with low-head hydro turbines. The first one was the power plant in La Rance (France), installed in 1966 and still operating. Other plants are installed in Russia (Kislaya Guba, 1.7 MW), Canada (Annapolis Royal Generation Station, 20 MW), China (Jiangxia, 3.9 MW), and Korea (Lake Sihwa. 254 MW) [5].</p>
        <p>The term ocean current is used to underline the different origin of marine currents in comparison to the tidal currents, previously described. Ocean currents are seawater circulations promoted by solar energy. Since the solar radiation varies with the latitude and considering the irregular distribution of the lands on the Earth's surface and the orography of seabed, the variation of water density produces water flows that are extended for thousands of kilometers. Superficial currents are, also, created by the wind interactions (that is also an effect of solar radiation) with the sea surface. Summing all these contributions, the thermohaline circulation is generated. The Gulf Stream is a famous ocean current (about 100 km wide and 800 m to 1200 m deep) that is originated from the Gulf of Mexico and flows up the North Pole with a speed of about 2.5 m/s [6]. Other famous currents are the Kuroshio Current (on the west side of Pacific Oceans) [7] and the Agulhas Current (on the south-eastern part of the Indian Ocean, along the coastline of South Africa) [8].</p>
        <p>About the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), the idea is the installation of a thermal machine using the superficial seawater as a thermal source and the deep water as a thermal sink [9]. The main problem is the low energy efficiency of this system, also in the best cases. Considering the installation of an ideal Carnot heat engine to exploit the available thermal sources, the energy efficiency is no more than 7%. Consequently, introducing the irreversibility of a real system, the power plant requires huge dimensions (especially the heat exchangers) to obtain a significant power output; thence the required investments are high. Two layouts for a possible OTEC power plant have been proposed: open cycle and closed cycle [9,10]. In the first one, the warm water from the sea surface is flashed to produce steam and then condensed using the cold deep water. The main disadvantages are related to the operative conditions. Indeed, steam generation requires a vacuum condition along with the entire plant, so air infiltration is possible. At the same time, the specific mass of steam is quite high (30-100 m 3 /kg), hence the system requires large pipes for small power outputs. In the second solution, the warm superficial water is used to evaporate a working fluid, normally used in the chilling sector such as ammonia, propane, or chlorofluorocarbon. This vapor is used to run a turbine, then it is condensed using the deep water as a refrigerant. The advantage is that the system works under pressure, so air infiltration is avoided. As a disadvantage, large heat exchangers are required [11].</p>
        <p>About the saline gradient energy source (called also Osmotic Power), the idea is the exploitation of chemical energy released when the freshwater from rivers is mixed with saltwater in the sea. Two solutions with different ions concentrations are characterized by different values of osmotic pressure. A solution, proposed in 1937, is the Pressure Retarded Osmosis, where the saltwater is pressurized before a semipermeable membrane. If the external pressure gradient is lower than the osmotic pressure, water flows from the diluted solution to the concentrated one. Brackish water is consequently produced, with the same pressure as the saline water but with a greater flow. Using a hydro turbine is possible to collect more energy than the pumping expenditure, producing an electrical output [12,13].</p>
        <p>Finally, sea wave is a form of marine energy due to the several forces acting on the water surface, such as the friction generated by wind, the Coriolis force (related to the Earth rotation), the celestial bodies attraction (tidal), or other unpredictable phenomena as earthquake and volcanic eruptions (tsunami) [14]. In any case, to describe this energy source, some definitions are required.</p>

        <p>A regular wave is classically modelled by a sine (or cosine) function of time and position, introducing the amplitude A, the wavelength λ, and the period T, reported in Equation (1) [15].</p>
        <p>In detail, fixing the observing time t 0 , the wavelength λ represents the minimal distance over which the wave shape is repeated, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

        <p>A regular wave is classically modelled by a sine (or cosine) function of time and position, introducing the amplitude 𝐴, the wavelength 𝜆, and the period 𝑇, reported in Equation (1) [15].</p>
        <p>In detail, fixing the observing time 𝑡 , the wavelength 𝜆 represents the minimal distance over which the wave shape is repeated, as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, selecting the observing point 𝑥 , the period 𝑇 represents the minimal time required to complete a single oscillation. Both conditions are expressed by the relations reported in Equation (2), considering 𝑛 as a generic natural number [15].</p>
        <p>The rate of propagation (called also phase velocity) 𝑣 represents the speed at which the wave profile travels and is given by the ratio 𝜆/𝑇.</p>
        <p>The amplitude 𝐴 represents the measure of the entire oscillating phenomenon in a single period. Two definitions are commonly used:</p>
        <p>Peak amplitude, i.e., the difference between the peak and the Surface Water Level (SWL). This definition is commonly used in the electronics sector.</p>
        <p>Peak-to-peak, i.e., the difference between the crest (the highest value during the oscillation) to the trough (the lowest one).</p>
        <p>To avoid misunderstanding, in the sea wave sector the term "height" (symbol 𝐻) is normally used to indicate the peak-to-peak amplitude (see Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Equation (1) can be used also to introduce other two parameters. The amount 2𝜋/𝑇 is called angular frequency and is indicated with the Greek letter 𝜔. Similarly, the amount 2𝜋/𝜆 is the wavenumber and indicated with 𝑘. Finally, the steepness is a nondimensional number given by the ratio 𝐻/𝜆.</p>
        <p>The parameters above introduced are commonly used to analyze the periodic signal, also irregular, by introducing the Fourier series. Considering only a time-dependent function to simplify, a generic period signal can be approximated by Equation (3), where Similarly, selecting the observing point x 0 , the period T represents the minimal time required to complete a single oscillation. Both conditions are expressed by the relations reported in Equation (2), considering n as a generic natural number [15]. z w (x + nλ, t 0 ) = z w (x, t 0 ) z w (x 0 , t + nT) = z w (x 0 , t)</p>
        <p>The rate of propagation (called also phase velocity) v p represents the speed at which the wave profile travels and is given by the ratio λ/T.</p>
        <p>The amplitude A represents the measure of the entire oscillating phenomenon in a single period. Two definitions are commonly used:</p>
        <p>Peak amplitude, i.e., the difference between the peak and the Surface Water Level (SWL). This definition is commonly used in the electronics sector.</p>

        <p>To avoid misunderstanding, in the sea wave sector the term "height" (symbol H) is normally used to indicate the peak-to-peak amplitude (see Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Equation ( 1) can be used also to introduce other two parameters. The amount 2π/T is called angular frequency and is indicated with the Greek letter ω. Similarly, the amount 2π/λ is the wavenumber and indicated with k. Finally, the steepness is a nondimensional number given by the ratio H/λ.</p>
        <p>The parameters above introduced are commonly used to analyze the periodic signal, also irregular, by introducing the Fourier series. Considering only a time-dependent function to simplify, a generic period signal can be approximated by Equation (3), where A 0 is the average value of the signal, A s,i and A c,i the amplitude of the harmonics used to approximate the input signal [15].</p>
        <p>The motion of a single particle of fluid during sea motion was described by the Airy wave equations (published by Sir George Biddel Airy in 1845), representing a linear solution to the hydrodynamic equations.</p>
        <p>The particle describes an elliptical motion around the mean position (x 0 , z 0 ) according to Equation (4) [16], tending to be circular in the surface (z 0 = 0) and practically horizontal near seabed (z 0 = -d w ), as depicted in Figure 2.</p>
        <p>𝐴 is the average value of the signal, 𝐴 , and 𝐴 , the amplitude of the harmonics used to approximate the input signal [15].</p>
        <p>The motion of a single particle of fluid during sea motion was described by the Airy wave equations (published by Sir George Biddel Airy in 1845), representing a linear solution to the hydrodynamic equations.</p>
        <p>The particle describes an elliptical motion around the mean position (𝑥 , 𝑧 ) according to Equation (4) [16], tending to be circular in the surface (𝑧 = 0) and practically horizontal near seabed (𝑧 = -𝑑 ), as depicted in Figure 2. Indeed, if the quote 𝑧 tends to -𝑑 (seabed), the factor cosh 𝑘(𝑧 + 𝑑 ) is equal to 1 while sinh 𝑘(𝑧 + 𝑑 ) is equal to 0.</p>
        <p>If the water depth 𝑑 tends to ∞, Equation ( 4) can be simplified in Equation ( 5), corresponding to the case of a circular motion [14].</p>
        <p>However, the sea wave phenomenon is an example of random waves, thence a statistical approach is normally used. The following definitions are commonly adopted during a measuring campaign in the open sea. The classical approach considers the sea wave phenomenon as a sum of a large number of sine wave components, each one with different amplitude 𝐴 , period 𝑇 , wavelength 𝜆 , and direction 𝜗 [17]. The term 𝜙 represents the wave phase, considered randomly distributed in the interval</p>
        <p>Using a statistical approach, it is possible to introduce a directional variance spectrum 𝑠(𝑓, 𝜗) indicating how the energy in the wave field is distributed with respect to frequency and direction [17].</p>
        <p>The directional variance spectrum 𝑠(𝑓, 𝜗) can be decomposed into two functions (see Equation ( 7)): 𝑠(𝑓) represents the total energy at each frequency independently of wave direction, while 𝐷(𝑓, 𝜗) expresses how the energy at a specific frequency is distributed according to the wave direction [14]. Indeed, if the quote z 0 tends to -d w (seabed), the factor cosh k(z 0 + d w ) is equal to 1 while sinh k(z 0 + d w ) is equal to 0.</p>
        <p>If the water depth d w tends to ∞, Equation ( 4) can be simplified in Equation ( 5), corresponding to the case of a circular motion [14].</p>
        <p>However, the sea wave phenomenon is an example of random waves, thence a statistical approach is normally used. The following definitions are commonly adopted during a measuring campaign in the open sea. The classical approach considers the sea wave phenomenon as a sum of a large number of sine wave components, each one with different amplitude A i , period T i , wavelength λ i , and direction ϑ i [17]. The term φ i represents the wave phase, considered randomly distributed in the interval [0, 2π].</p>
        <p>Using a statistical approach, it is possible to introduce a directional variance spectrum s( f , ϑ) indicating how the energy in the wave field is distributed with respect to frequency and direction [17].</p>
        <p>The directional variance spectrum s( f , ϑ) can be decomposed into two functions (see Equation (7)): s( f ) represents the total energy at each frequency independently of wave direction, while D( f , ϑ) expresses how the energy at a specific frequency is distributed according to the wave direction [14].</p>
        <p>By the integration over the entire space, the omnidirectional spectrum or frequency spectrum is obtained in Equation ( 8) [18]:</p>
        <p>Energies 2021, 14, 6604 5 of 31</p>
        <p>where the directional distribution function D( f , ϑ) satisfies the conditions expressed by Equation ( 9) [14]:</p>
        <p>The definition of frequency spectrum S( f ) is fundamental since several statistical parameters used in sea wave analysis are defined on this basis. The n-th order momentum of frequency spectrum m n is defined by Equation (10) [18]:</p>
        <p>The significant height H s is equal to four times the standard deviation of the surface elevation or equivalently as four times the square root of the zeroth-order moment of the wave spectrum [19], so:</p>
        <p>In the past, the significant height was traditionally defined as the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves [15], according to Equation (12).</p>
        <p>It is important to underline that the two definitions are practically equivalent as a more accurate correlation shows that H 1/3 = 4.01 √ m 0 , so the difference is negligible [19].</p>
        <p>In the literature, sometimes other parameters are used to describe the wave height [20]:</p>
        <p>Mean wave represents the average value of all measured waves in the measuring period.</p>
        <p>H 1/10 Wave one-tenth is the mean wave height of the highest tenth of the waves.</p>
        <p>H max Maximum wave height is the maximum value measured in the site. It is relevant to design structures that are exposed to sea waves.</p>
        <p>In the literature, the average period T m represents the average value of all waves, measured in a fixed interval (for example 30 min or 1 h). A more rigorous definition is given by Equation ( 13) [17]:</p>
        <p>Another common period is the mean wave period T z defined as the square root of the zero-order momentum and the second-order momentum of the frequency spectrum (see Equation ( 14)) [21]:</p>
        <p>It is also possible to define a Peak Period T p corresponding to the peak of the variance density spectrum S( f ).</p>
        <p>Finally, the wave-energy period T e is defined as the variance-weighted mean period of the one-dimensional period variance density spectrum S( f ) [22]. Analytically, the energy period is defined by Equation (15):</p>
        <p>This parameter is commonly used for the evaluation of potential energy production. As Equation ( 15) is quite complex to perform, simplified correlations are available in the literature.</p>
        <p>As an example, the Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources suggests the correlation between the energy period and the average period, expressed by Equation (16) [22]:</p>
        <p>The energy period can be also evaluated from the peak period T p , according to Equation (17). The value 0.86 is obtained in the case of the Pierson Moskowitz spectrum [23]. This value is commonly used in the surrounded seas with a limited surface, such as the Mediterranean Sea [18].</p>
        <p>T e = 0.86 T m (17) The Pierson Moskowitz spectrum, above cited, is modelled by Equation (18), where α PM e β PM are two parameters related to the sea state, defined by the significant height H s and the peak period T p (or equivalently the peak frequency f p = 1/T p ) [24,25]:</p>
        <p>In the original work, the Pierson Moskowitz spectrum was related to the wind speed measured at 19.5 m above the average sea level, using a similar formulation [14].</p>
        <p>Another common spectrum is the JONSWAP (acronym of Joint North Sea Wave Observation Project) spectrum, obtained from Pierson Moskowitz spectrum multiplied by an extra peak enhancement factor γ δ( f ) [26]:</p>
        <p>In the JONSWAP distribution, all parameters are obtained from the observed sea [17]. A qualitative comparison of the Pierson Moskovitz spectrum and JONSWAP spectrum is reported in Figure 3, where the x-axis is normalized by the peak frequency and the y-axis by the maximum value of the Pierson Moskovitz spectrum. The graph underlines the effect produced by an extra peak enhancement factor introduced in the JONSWAP spectrum, as in the real application all parameters are calculated to approximate the measuring data [14]. In oceanography, the term "sea state" is used to indicate the temporary (about a half-hour) and local conditions of the sea surface (with respect to wind waves and swell) as a consequence of wind interaction. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines the sea states according to the Douglas Sea Scale, reported in Table 2. Analyzing the phenomenon of sea wave propagation, the group velocity v g is introduced, representing the velocity at which wave-energy travels, and defined by Equation (20):</p>
        <p>In general, the phenomenon is influenced by the water depth. Considering a finite water depth d w , the wavenumber k = 2π/λ and the angular frequency ω = 2π/T are related by the dispersion relation, expressed by Equation (21).</p>
        <p>It is interesting to observe that in the case of deep water (d w /λ &gt; 1/2), the term tanh(kd w ) is close to 1; in the case of shallow water (d w /λ &lt; 1/20) the same term is equivalent to kd w [24]. Thus, in these cases, Equation ( 21) is replaced by Equation (22):</p>
        <p>Energies 2021, 14, 6604 8 of 31</p>
        <p>Combining the equations above reported, the velocity group is given by Equation (23) [22]:</p>
        <p>that can be simplified in two forms, according to the case of shallow water and deep water, respectively (see Equation ( 24)).</p>
        <p>With the target to exploit sea waves as a renewable energy source, it is important to evaluate the amount of energy associate with the phenomenon.</p>
        <p>It is possible to define the total amount of energy, related to sea wave for a unitary surface E t . (sum of kinetic and potential energy) according to Equation ( 25):</p>
        <p>The value 8 (instead of 2) at the denominator is because wave height is double the wave amplitude.</p>
        <p>The wave-energy flux is defined as the power of a unitary wavefront, which is given by Equation ( 26):</p>
        <p>Equations ( 25) and ( 26) can be applied only for a monochromatic wave spectrum. Since the real sea states are represented by a sum of several monochromatic waves, an approximation is given by Equations ( 27) and ( 28), using the definition of significant height.</p>
        <p>The phase velocity for gravity wave is given by Equation (29):</p>
        <p>consequently, in the case of deep water (where v g = v p /2), the wave-energy flux is finally obtained, according to Equation (30):</p>
        <p>In the literature, this equation is universally adopted to estimate the wave-energy potential in a specific site, knowing the energy period T e and the significant height H s [21,22,28,29].</p>
        <p>As introduced before, the sea state, identified by the significant height and the energy period, represents one of the several possible conditions that can be observed in the site.</p>
        <p>A simple way to report data on the measured sea states is the scatter table (see Figure 4), reporting the equivalent hours in which a specific condition (T e , H s ) is measured (picture on the left) or the corresponding annual energy availability (picture on the right). [21,22,28,29].</p>

A generic device to exploit the sea wave-energy source is affected by energy efficiency, due to the transferring of energy from the sea wave to the device (hydraulic efficiency 𝜂 ) and the internal transformation to electricity (electrical efficiency 𝜂 ). According to the definition of sea wave flux (power per unitary length of wavefront), the electricity production from the sea waves can be estimated by Equation (31):</p>
        <p>where 𝑑 is the equivalent diameter of the system that recovers the energy from sea wave, 𝐻 , is the i-th class of significant height, 𝑇 , is the j-th class of energy period and 𝑡 , is the number of hours in which the condition (𝐻 , , 𝑇 , ) is measured.</p>

        <p>assuming an average hydraulic efficiency 𝜂 , an average electrical efficiency 𝜂 of the system 𝜂 , , and indicating with ℎ the number of hours per month [31].</p>

        <p>Among the renewable energy sources, the exploitation of sea waves represents a recent sector, despite the first patent was registered in France in 1799 [32]. Many authors claim that sea waves could play a significant role in the energy sector, especially in small islands [33][34][35]. Recent statistics indicate that the total theoretical wave-energy potential could achieve 30 × 10 6 GWh/year; however, this renewable source is irregularly distributed worldwide [36,37]. As shown in Figure 5, there are some hot spots (red-colored areas in the picture), i.e., regions with the highest values of wave-energy potential. The most energetic area is the southern part of Australia, Africa, and America, because of the limited presence of lands. Other relevant areas are located between North America and Japan in the Pacific Ocean and between Europe, Greenland, and North America in the Atlantic Ocean. All these regions are exposed to extreme weather conditions, for this reason, sea wave harvesting is complicated [20,38].</p>

In this context, the device able to extract energy from sea waves and produce electrical energy or other useful energy output is commonly defined as Wave-Energy Converters (WEC) [32]. These systems are classified using different criteria such as the position to the coastline, the typical size, the orientation to the direction of wave propagation, or the working principle [39]. As shown in Figure 6, considering the orientation of the system to the direction of wave propagation, it is possible to define [40]:</p>
        <p>Attenuators, these systems are oriented parallel to the wave direction. Since the device has a length of the same order as the wavelength, it adapts its shape to the wave profile, extracting energy from sea waves.</p>
        <p>Point absorbers, these systems work independently of wave direction due to their small sizes in comparison with the wavelength.</p>
        <p>Terminators, these systems are oriented perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Sea wave ends on the device, transferring its energy.

        <p>The air inside the chamber is pressurized and depressurized by the water oscillation, producing a bidirectional airflow usable to run special wind turbines.

        <p>Wave-activated bodies. In this case, the sea wave produces relative motions on the systems, running the energy converters. This kind of system can be assembled in several configurations to produce a rotation or a translation. About the installation, there are floating systems and submerged ones.</p>
        <p>Overtopping devices. In this case, seawater is conveyed in a reservoir, using a ramp to convert the kinetic energy of sea waves into potential energy. The water is consequently spilled from the reservoir and used to produce electricity, using a low-head hydro turbine.</p>
        <p>About the distance from the coastline, it is common to define the following regions, Figure 7: • Onshore. In this case, the system is directly fixed on the mainland, simplifying the maintenance and the installation of the device.</p>
        <p>Nearshore. It represents the transition region between the shoreline and the effective offshore area. In this zone, sea wave energy starts to be dissipated by the seabed. In simple terms, the nearshore region starts where the water depth is about half of the wavelength and ends where the depth is one-twentieth of wavelength.</p>
        <p>Offshore, the region where the sea wave phenomenon is practically not influenced by the seabed. In this area, waves are strong and regular. Considering the working principle, the following categories are identified [41]:</p>
        <p>• Oscillating water column. In this system, sea wave enters inside a chamber open to the atmosphere. Inside the chamber, sea wave produces a vertical water oscillation. The air inside the chamber is pressurized and depressurized by the water oscillation, producing a bidirectional airflow usable to run special wind turbines. The system can be installed on the coastline or integrated into a floating device.</p>

        <p>Offshore, the region where the sea wave phenomenon is practically not influenced by the seabed. In this area, waves are strong and regular. After this classification, a list of devices, divided into working principles, is reported.</p>
        <p>Several Oscillating Water Column (OWC) devices have been proposed in the past. According to the position of the system from the coastline, OWC devices can be classified as fixed or floating [37].</p>
        <p>In the first case, the OWC plant is installed via a fixed structure on the shoreline or close to it, or in natural or artificial structures, such as breakwaters and rock cliffs [37].</p>
        <p>The installation of WEC directly on the shoreline has several benefits. The maintenance operations are simplified, reducing the relative costs. At the same time, the costs for the mooring system are minimized. Furthermore, the entire electrical equipment for the energy conversion is installed out of the water [32].</p>
        <p>As mentioned before, the OWC devices are designed to produce a vertical oscillation of water inside a chamber to produce the alternative compression and expansion of the air inside the same chamber. Since the airflow changes continually its direction, the traditional horizontal-axis air turbines cannot be adopted. A solution is represented by the Wells turbine, developed in the mid-1970s by Alan Arthur Wells (in that period professor at Queen's University of Belfast) [32].</p>
        <p>The Wells turbine is a low-pressure air turbine, characterized by the ability to rotate in one direction independently of the airflow direction. The blades are characterized by symmetrical airfoils where the plane of the symmetry is the same as the plane of rotation Energies 2021, 14, 6604 and perpendicular to the airflow direction. As reported in [32], the Wells turbine is affected by a low (or negative) torque in the case of a small airflow rate; significant aerodynamic losses, and noise in comparison with other wind turbines. Thus, this turbine requires a greater section to achieve the same power output as other turbines. Nevertheless, the Wells turbine has been applied in several OWC plants.</p>
        <p>As an example of a full-scale OWC system, the Kvaerner Brug's OWC plant was realized at Toftesfallen (Norway) in 1985 [42], with an electrical rated power of 500 kW [43]. The lower part was realized in concrete, with a height of 3.5 m above sea level. As reported in Figure 8, this part of the system formed a chamber, communicating to the sea under the water level. The upper part (steel tower), achieving the height of 21 m, was equipped with a self-rectifying air turbine, with a rated power of 500 kW. Unluckily, this plant was destroyed by a severe storm at the end of 1988. Despite the proposal to replace the damaged part, the system was decommissioned, keeping only the concrete part on the testing site. In its short operative life, the Kvaerner Brug's OWC plant delivered 29 MWh to the electrical grid [44].</p>

In 1990 an OWC system was installed at Vizhinjam (Trivandrum, Kerala, India), composed by a concrete caisson, and installed near the original breakeven structure. The project considered the installation of a Wells turbine coupled with an induction generator (150 kW) in order to be directly coupled with the electrical grid [45].</p>
        <p>In reality, the results were under the expectation: the output power was highly variable in the range 0-60 kW in a few seconds and the induction motor frequently was an electrical load instead of a generator, consuming more energy than the energy produced [46]. The plant was inactive for a long period. In 2004 the plant was investigated to supply a Reverse Osmosis desalination plant. This OWC device was finally decommissioned in 2011 [47]. This OWC system is reported in Figure 9.</p>
        <p>Based on the same principle, in 2000 the Islay LIMPET (Land Installed Marine Power Energy Transmitter) was installed on the Scottish island of Islay. This plant was realized and operated by Wavegen in cooperation with the Queen's University of Belfast. Islay LIMPET was the full-scale version of a previous prototype (75 kW) realized in 1991. The OWC system is reported in Figure 10.</p>

However, the generated power achieved a peak of 180 kW in the first two years of operation, for this reason, the plant was declassed to a rated power of 250 kW [51]. The plant demonstrated the working principle, revealing the issue of noise generation due to the operation of Well turbines. A noise attenuator chamber was added at the end of the turbine chamber, however, causing malfunctioning to the device [50].

        <p>Similar technology was also developed in Portugal, under the supervision of Instituto Superior Técnico of Lisbon. In 1999 a full-scale (400 kW) OWC plant was realized in Pico Island (Azores, Portugal) [50]. Some problems were due to malfunctions of the Wells turbine and its support. The project was concluded in January 2018, demonstrating the feasibility of this technology [52]. The Pico Plant is reported in Figure 11.</p>
        <p>In 2011, an OWC plant was inaugurated in the bay of Mutriku (Spain) [53]. The power plant is 100 m long and has an installed power of 296 kW. It is composed of 16 OWC chambers, each one equipped with a Wells turbine. The producer indicated a total electricity production equal to 2.1 GWh (updated to the end of September 2020) [54]. The OWC system is reported in Figure 12.</p>
        <p>An OWC system, called REWEC3 (REsonant Wave-Energy Converter), has been developed in Italy, by the University of Reggio Calabria [37]. This system is designed to be incorporated into a traditional vertical breaker in the harbor. In comparison with other OWC devices, the main difference is the U-shape connection between the internal chamber and the sea (see Figure 13) that is chosen to adapt the resonance frequency of the system to sea wave. Thus, it is possible to maximize the energy extraction [55]. In the port of Civitavecchia, a full-scale plant has been installed, composed of 136 chambers and a rated power of 2.5 MW [3]. In 2016 the system, with a length of 100 m, produced 500 MWh/y. After the optimization, the designers want to achieve an annual production of 800 MWh/y.</p>

The other family of OWC devices is composed of floating systems. The working principle is the same. The main difference is related to the structure, where the OWC device is installed. Indeed, the most popular solution is represented by the adoption of floating buoys, equipped with chambers used to produce the water oscillation.</p>
        <p>One of the first floating OWC was developed in Japan between the 1960s and 1970s by the team of Yoshio Masuda.

        <p>The Spar Buoy is a vertical pipe installed in a floating buoy that has a cylindrical shape. This aspect improves the energy extraction from sea waves because the system works independently of wave direction. For this reason, it is classified as Point Absorber.

The turbines were alternatively activated according to sea states [67]. The prototype was installed 1.5 km away from the coastline of Gokasho Bay (Japan), in July 1998.

        <p>The following Table 3 summarizes the main specifics of the current technologies for sea wave harvesting, based on the OWC principle.</p>
        <p>The category of Wave-Activated Bodies (WAB) comprises several kinds of solutions for sea wave exploitation. These systems are generally composed of two or more parts, arranged to produce a relative motion and run the energy converter [68].</p>
        <p>These systems are generally designed for nearshore or offshore installation, to exploit the more regular waves of the open sea, in comparison with the systems installed on the coastline. However, the installation far away from the coastline increases the number of problems. Indeed, long underwater cables or pipes are required to transfer the energy collected by the WEC to the mainland. These devices need also a mooring system, strong enough to resist extreme weather conditions [69]. Since there are several WABs, a classification is introduced by considering the working principle of the device as criterium [32]: single-body heaving buoys, two-body heaving systems, fully submerged heaving systems, pitching devices, bottom-hinged systems, and many-body systems.</p>
        <p>An example is a system composed essentially of a buoy able to move along a metallic strut anchored to the seabed by a universal joint. The idea was the exploitation of this vertical motion to pressurize an air reserve and, consequently, run an air turbine. A prototype, with a buoy one-meter diameter, was tested in 1983 in the Trondheim Fjord (Norway), replacing the air turbine with an orifice [32]. A solution of this technology (Figure 18) was developed at Uppsala University (Sweden), called the Lysekil project [32,70]. As shown in the picture, the vertical motion is used to run a linear generator, with a rated power of 10 kW. This plant was enlarged with the other two WECs and today is currently operating, achieving a total installed power of 30 kW [71].</p>

In this case, the WEC is composed of two floating buoys to produce a relative motion usable to extract energy. The shapes of the two floaters are normally different to maximize the relative motion.</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 19, Wavebob is an example of a two-body heaving system. To improve the relative motion between the two parts of the WEC, the central buoy is equipped with a big mass, increasing the inertia, and limiting the vertical motion. The inferior buoy is designed to be submerged at depth enough to minimize the interference with sea waves. The vertical motion produced by the upper buoy (body 1) is used to run an oil pumping system. A small-scale (1:4) prototype was tested in Galway Bay (Ireland) [32,72].

To minimize the cost of the electrical connection with the mainland, an offshore substation could be realized. In 2005 a pilot plant (40 kW) was tested in an offshore site, close to Atlantic City (NJ, USA) [70,74]. In 2008, another plant of the same size was installed off the coast of Santoña (Spain) [32].</p>

        <p>As shown in Figure 21, the system comprises two parts: a basement that is anchored to the seabed, and a floater. The device works using the variation of the hydrostatic pressure applied to the floater that pushes up and down a linear generator installed inside. In 2004, a pilot plant was tested successfully in Portugal [32]. After this test, AWS Ocean Energy Ltd. was started in Scotland. Recent news reports the development of a 16 kW device [75]. PowerBuoy is another example of a two-body heaving system, developed by the American company Ocean Power Technologies. As shown in Figure 20 [70,73], this WEC is composed of a floater, which is free to move up and down according to sea wave, and a submerged body, with a disk shape adopted to improve the inertia and hydrodynamic resistance of this part and maximize the relative motion between the two main parts of the device.

CETO (name inspired by a Greek ocean goddess) is another fully submerged device, proposed by Carnegie Clean Energy. This system is designed to be installed in the nearshore, a few meters below sea level. The previous version (CETO 5) was designed to pump water for a station located on the coast where electricity and freshwater are produced, using a Reverse Osmotic unit [77,78]. The project of an upgraded version (called CETO 6, with a rated power of 1.5 MW) was started in Western Australia in 2014 to produce electricity directly on the WEC. The technology is shown in Figure 22. However, the project was discontinued on 31 October 2019 [79].</p>
        <p>In the pitching devices, the main motion is a relative rotation (usually pitch) among the parts.</p>
        <p>A first example was the Salter's Duck (also called the nodding Duck), developed by the team of Prof Stephen Salter at the University of Edinburg (UK), between the 1970s and 1980s. In detail, this device is composed of a floater, with a cam shape (see Figure 23) [80,81]. As a first solution, a hydraulic pumping system was proposed to convert the rotary motion into electricity. As an alternative solution, a gyroscope system was proposed some years later [81]. CETO (name inspired by a Greek ocean goddess) is another fully submerged device, proposed by Carnegie Clean Energy.

In detail, the system had a shape similar to a snake, oriented according to the wave direction, achieving a length of 120 m and a rated power of 750 kW. The working principle of Pelamis was based on the generation of a relative rotation on the PCM, equipped with hinged joints, to pump oil at high pressure into accumulators and then run hydraulic motors coupled with induction generators.</p>

        <p>The Bottom-Hinged Systems are designed to exploit sea waves in shallow water (10-15 m), where the sea motion is mainly horizontal. An example is Oyster, which is illustrated in Figure 25 [86,87].</p>
        <p>This device consists essentially of a barrier, made of five cylinders horizontally stacked. Since the barrier is fixed by a horizontal hinge, the braking wave produces a rotation, activating a high-pressure pump. The pressurized water is conveyed along pipes to the coastline, where hydro turbines and alternators are installed to produce electricity. This kind of WEC was proposed by the team of Professor Trevor Whittaker, from the Queen's University of Belfast. The company Aquamarine Power developed and tested two fullscale plants at the European Marine Energy Centre's Billia Croo test site (Orkney): Oyster Pelamis was a famous example of a pitching device [32]. It was developed in the UK by Scottish company "Pelamis Wave Power Ltd.". A first prototype, connected to the electrical grid, was tested in Orkney (Scotland) between 2004 and 2007. In 2008 a wave farm with three devices was installed at Aguçadoura (Portugal). Unluckily, the wave farm worked only for two months due to technical failures, causing financial problems to the company. The intellectual property was transferred to the Scottish government in November 2014.

        <p>Regardless of the selected technologies, the main barrier is represented by the costs for the development of these systems. The participation of governments becomes very important. Many governments have participated in the construction of energy production plants because it is in their interest to enable the development of renewable technologies, although some not very efficient plants have been decommissioned since funding has been cut off.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, it is important to highlight that this energy sector is very is complicated and involves the management of many interrelated factors; for example, in addition to the objective of energy production, attention must be paid to the resistance of the equipment, which must withstand the harsh marine environment. Research has progressed and borne fruit, but it is still possible to aim higher.</p>
