        <p>The Ediacaran-Cambrian transition, which incorporates the radiation of animals, lacks a robust global temporal and spatial framework, resulting in major uncertainty in the evolutionary dynamics of this critical radiation and its relationship to changes in palaeoenvironmental geochemistry. We first present a new δ 13 Ccarb composite reference curve for the Ediacaran Nama Group of southern Namibia, and we then outline four new possible global age models (A to D) for the interval 551-517 million years ago (Ma). These models comprise composite carbonate-carbon isotope (δ 13 Ccarb) curves, which are anchored to radiometric ages and consistent with strontium isotope chemostratigraphy, and are used to calibrate metazoan distribution in space and time. These models differ most prominently in the temporal position of the basal Cambrian negative δ 13 Ccarb excursion (BACE). Regions that host the most complete records show that the BACE nadir always predates the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary as defined by the first appearance datum (FAD) of the ichnospecies Treptichnus pedum. Whilst treptichnid traces are present in the late Ediacaran fossil record, the FAD of the ichnospecies T. pedum appears to post-date the LAD of in situ Cloudina and Namacalathus in all environments with high-resolution δ 13 Ccarb data. Two age models (A and B) place the BACE within the Ediacaran, and yield an age of ~538.8 Ma for the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary; however models C and D appear to be the most parsimonious and may support a recalibration of the boundary age by up to 3 Myr younger. All age models reveal a previously underappreciated degree of variability in the terminal Ediacaran, incorporating notable positive and negative excursions that precede the BACE. Nothwithstanding remaining uncertainties in chemostratigraphic correlation, all models support a pre-BACE first appearance of Cambrian-type shelly fossils in Siberia and possibly South China, and show that the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition was a protracted interval represented by a series of successive radiations.</p>
        <p>The Ediacaran-Cambrian radiation occurred over a protracted interval without global mass extinctions and with generally diachronous metazoan appearances.</p>
        <p>The late Ediacaran to early Cambrian interval encompasses the Gaskiers glaciation (~580 Ma), the first appearance of complex macroscopic life (~575 Ma), mobile biota (≤560 Ma), skeletal metazoans (~550 Ma), and the origin of modern metazoan phyla (Wood et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Understanding the temporal and spatial context of these events is currently limited due to the lack of high-resolution age models to allow correlation of key sections. The geological record throughout this interval also contains numerous unconformities and gaps of uncertain duration, a sparse global distribution of datable stratiform volcanic deposits, and diverse endemic biotas, resulting in loose chronostratigraphic and biostratigraphic control. As a result, no consistent global chronostratigraphic correlation exists, particularly for the critical late Ediacaran to lower Cambrian (Fortunian Stage) interval. Early metazoans evolved in a highly dynamic Earth system, and so without a high-resolution temporal and spatial framework we are unable to address many profound uncertainties, including the evolutionary dynamics of the Cambrian Explosion, the response of metazoans to local and global changes in oceanic redox conditions and nutrient availability, and whether one or more contemporaneous mass extinctions occurred.</p>
        <p>The formal placement of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in the Fortune Head section, Newfoundland, Canada, which is based on the first appearance datum (FAD) of Treptichnus pedum ichnospecies (Brasier et al., 1994), has been particularly problematic since it occurs in a section with few datable volcanics, sparse skeletal biota, and limited potential for chemostratigraphy (Babcock et al., 2014). Indeed, the choice of T. pedum as a marker fossil for the basal Cambrian has also been a source of contention given the strong environmental, lithological and facies dependency for preservation of this trace, resulting in a notable absence from carbonate-dominated successions (e.g. Babcock et al., 2014). A similar problem is encountered when attempting to define the basal Cambrian using the first appearance of 'Cambrian-type' small skeletal fossils, which are themselves absent or rare in siliciclasticdominated successions, especially in environments that were not conducive to early phosphatization. To overcome this complication, a holistic integration of radiometric, chemostratigraphic and palaeontological data across this interval is crucial. At present, the age of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary is 541.0 ± 1. 0 Ma (ICC 2021), however the radiometric age of a tuff deposit in the Nama Group, Namibia, on the Kalahari Craton, provides a current best estimate of 538.8 Ma for the maximum age of the first appearance of T. pedum (Linnemann et al., 2019;Xiao and Narbonne, 2020).</p>
        <p>The carbon isotopic composition of marine carbonates (δ 13 Ccarb) is most commonly considered to reflect secular changes in the ratio of 13 C to 12 C in seawater that are associated with changes in the relative export/burial rates of inorganic versus organic carbon (Kaufman et al., 1991;Keith and Weber, 1964;Veizer et al., 1980;Veizer and Hoefs, 1976). As a result, secular δ 13 Ccarb profiles have been used for regional and global correlation (Halverson et al., 2010;Macdonald et al., 2013;Maloof et al., 2010;Yang et al., n.d.;Zhu et al., 2007). However, a number of local effects have also been proposed that may partially decouple the local record of primary δ 13 Ccarb from the composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the open ocean. These include diurnal coupling between photosynthesis and carbonate saturation in shallow carbonate settings (Geyman and Maloof, 2019), local DIC pools of distinct isotopic composition (Cui et al., 2020b;Melim et al., 2002), and the possibility for water-column methanogenesis and carbonate recycling under low-sulfate conditions associated with restriction (Cui et al., 2020b). Additionally, facies-specific diagenetic regimes can yield distinct δ 13 Ccarb for time-equivalent sections in modern marine basins (Melim et al., 2002), and this has also been established in the Cryogenian interglacial ocean (Hoffman and Lamothe, 2019), and the Paleoproterozoic Lomagundi-Jatuli event (Prave et al., 2021). As a result, changes in δ 13 Ccarb may in fact archive contemporaneous pools of DIC from adjacent depositional settings with variable C isotope composition. The potential for both local water column DIC and the effects of carbonate diagenesis to result in significant deviation of δ 13 Ccarb from global seawater δ 13 C may therefore be problematic when building δ 13 Ccarb-based age frameworks.</p>
        <p>Despite these potential complications, it is not clear why during certain intervals of geological history some depositional settings acquire δ 13 Ccarb values that deviate markedly from mean values (Hoffman and Lamothe, 2019). For example, integrated δ 13 Ccarb, δ 44 Ca, δ 26 Mg and sequence stratigraphic study of the Cryogenian interglacial Trezona δ 13 Ccarb excursion reveals that, whilst facies-specific trends in δ 13 Ccarb may correspond with fluid vs sediment buffered diagenesis, the excursion itself is of global significance and may correspond with global changes in siliciclastic vs carbonate sedimentation, nutrient delivery, and eustatic sea level (Ahm et al., 2021). Therefore, notwithstanding uncertainties in the driving mechansims for δ 13 Ccarb records and possible faciesrelated, diagenetic offsets, the secular trends represented by gradual unidirectional shifts in δ 13 Ccarb in multiple globally distributed and temporally equivalent open-marine sections may reflect changes to the carbon cycle that are of global significance, and hence are applicable for chemostratigraphic correlation.</p>
        <p>To date, efforts to produce a global composite Ediacaran δ 13 Ccarb record (e.g. Macdonald et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2021) have revealed the middle Ediacaran Shuram negative anomaly at around &lt;579 -&gt;564 Ma (Rooney et al., 2020;Yang et al., 2021), followed by a positive shift from ca.</p>
        <p>564-550 Ma. The sedimentary record from ca. 564-550 Ma is radiometrically well dated in Baltica (the East European Platform) (Yang et al., 2021) and Avalonia (Matthews et al., 2020;Noble et al., 2015); however, siliciclastic strata with poor δ 13 Ccarb resolution dominate these successions. A subsequent negative excursion with a recovery at ~550 Ma (Yang et al., 2021) is followed by a final late Ediacaran positive plateau (the EPIP, Zhu et al., 2017). This plateau appears to terminate with the onset of a globally widespread large magnitude (min  13 Ccarb of -10‰) negative excursion, termed '1n' in strata of the Siberian Platform, and in previous global compilations (Kouchinsky et al., 2007;Maloof et al., 2010). This excursion is considered to be approximately coincident with the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary and has also previously been termed the 'Basal Cambrian negative  13 Ccarb excursion' (BACE); an acronym that is adopted herein. The age of the BACE is currently correlated with a radiometrically dated negative excursion in the A4 Member of the Ara Group, Oman at ~541 Ma (Bowring et al., 2007;Hodgin et al., 2020;Maloof et al., 2010;Smith et al., 2015). Possible mass extinctions have been suggested between the Ediacaran White Sea and Nama biotic assemblages, and again at the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, coincident with the BACE (e.g. Amthor et al., 2003;Darroch et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Determining the global nature and age of the BACE has been particularly problematic, but is critical for developing a robust biostratigraphic and chronostratigraphic framework across this interval. The BACE reaches a δ 13 Ccarb nadir of -10‰ and has been recorded in all fossiliferous successions with high-resolution  13 Ccarb data, except the Nama Group. The FAD of T. pedum occurs above the BACE in all regions that host both features (e.g. Smith et al., 2015Smith et al., , 2016;;Hodgin et al., 2020). As a radiometric basis for the age of the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary derives from the Nama Group (Linnemann et al., 2019;Xiao and Narbonne, 2020), the position of the BACE (if present) in the Nama succession must be determined. Recent high precision radiometric and δ 13 Ccarb data from Laurentia appear to constrain the age of the BACE nadir to ≤539.4 Ma, coincident with stable positive δ 13 Ccarb data on the Kalahari craton (Hodgin et al., 2020). It has therefore been suggested that the conflicting δ 13 Ccarb trends between the Laurentian and Kalahari datasets may result from local pools of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with distinct isotopic compositions (Hodgin et al., 2020). In order to test whether these data are unrepresentative of global δ 13 Ccarb, it is first necessary to discount all alternative possibilities associated with uncertainties in the δ 13 Ccarb age model framework.</p>
        <p>Here, we present an updated δ 13 Ccarb framework for the Ediacaran Nama Group of southern Namibia. These data are first correlated regionally by combined litho-, chemo-, and sequence stratigraphy, then constrained in time using published high precision U-Pb ages determined via zircon chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS).</p>
        <p>We correlate trends in the resulting Nama reference curve with δ 13 Ccarb data from globally distributed sections that are well constrained by interbedded zircon U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS ages, and robust high-resolution regional section correlation, for the interval ~551 -538.5 Ma. The δ 13 Ccarb record is then extended to 517 Ma in multiple regions with high resolution litho-, chemo-, and sequence stratigraphic records. Compiled data from sections that host the most robust radiometric constraints throughout this interval act as framework curves to reveal trends in the global data that can be confidently constrained in age. These curves are used to anchor a wider correlation in order to best fit high-resolution δ 13 Ccarb data from key sections that lack robust radiometric constraints. This allows construction of four possible composite carbon isotope curves and age models, comprising 130 globally distributed sections (Australia, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Morocco, Namibia, Mexico, USA, Canada, Oman, Siberia and South China). These curves are consistent with all reliable radiometric age data and strontium isotope ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) records between ~551 -517 Ma (Tables S1 andS2). All models reveal a previously underappreciated degree of variability in the EPIP, incorporating multiple positive and negative excursions preceding the BACE that are globally widespread. Differences between the four age models result from ongoing uncertainties which we review in detail. All FADs and, for Ediacaran taxa, Last Appearance Datums (LADs) of key fossil occurrences are calibrated within this framework (Tables S2 andS3). This provides the basis for biotic temporal and spatial distributions to be accurately constrained and visualized.</p>
        <p>The Nama Group in Nambia and South Africa, comprises a richly-fossiliferous mixed carbonate-siliciclastic succession deposited in a foreland basin on the Kalahari Craton. The succession developed during flexural subsidence associated with two major orogenies; the Damara to the north, and the Gariep to the southwest (Germs, 1983;Germs and Gresse, 1991;Gresse and Germs, 1993) (Fig. 1). Near-complete exposure and minimal structural deformation across hundreds of square kilometers have inspired half a century of detailed sedimentological and palaeontological research, incorporating high resolution litho-, chemo-and sequence stratigraphy (Darroch et al., 2015(Darroch et al., , 2016(Darroch et al., , 2021;;Jensen et al., 2000;Saylor, 2003;Saylor et al., 1998;Smith, 1998;Wood et al., 2015). These aspects, in combination with high-precision radiometric age calibration (Bowring et al., 2007;Grotzinger et al., 1995;Linnemann et al., 2019), make the Nama Group the best candidate succession globally for construction of a terminal Ediacaran δ 13 Ccarb reference curve. This is especially the case for the lower Nama Group (Kuibis Subgroup), where carbonate ramp deposits are ubiquitous throughout the northern (Zaris) sub-basin.</p>
        <p>δ 13 Ccarb data from fifteen sections of the Nama Group, Namibia (Saylor et al., 1995;Smith, 1998;Wood et al., 2015), compiled within a sequence stratigraphic framework and calibrated to dated volcanic tuff interbeds, result in a composite Ediacaran Nama δ 13 Ccarb reference curve (Fig. 1). Gaps in the δ 13 Ccarb record of individual sections are permitted at exposure or erosion surfaces, or during significant intervals of siliciclastic deposition. Below, we explore implications for global correlation of the δ 13 Ccarb reference curve derived for the and Schwarzrand (&lt;546 -538 Ma) subgroups.</p>
        <p>In the Kuibis Subgroup succession, positive, laterally consistent δ 13 Ccarb values in the lower Hoogland Member (Zaris Formation) of the Zaris sub-basin are constrained by a zircon U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS age of 547.36 ± 0.23 Ma (Bowring et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). Carbonate strata in multiple sections below this ash bed record a gradual recovery from a negative δ 13 Ccarb excursion. This can be readily correlated with the δ 13 Ccarb trend expressed in strata of the lower Dengying Formation, South China. Recovery from this negative δ 13 Ccarb excursion in the lower Dengying Formation is constrained by a zircon U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS age of 550.1 ± 0.6 Ma (Yang et al., 2021, updated from 551.09 ± 1.02 Ma, Condon et al., 2005) from an ash bed in the underlying Miaohe Member at Jijiawan (/Jiuqunao) section (Table S1). The age of the 0‰ crossing point in the lower Kuibis Subgroup can therefore be anchored to ~550 Ma. The preceding negative excursion (≥550 Ma),</p>
        <p>Nama Group, Namibia with resulting reference curve for the Kalahari craton for the interval ~550 -538.5 Ma (Saylor et al., 1998;Smith, 1998;Wood et al., 2015). (a) Litho-, chemo-and sequence stratigraphic correlation for sections of the Zaris sub-basin after Smith (1998) and Wood et al. (2015). New data for sections 12 and 14. (b) Resulting Nama δ 13 Ccarb reference curve showing position of tuff bed age constraints and sequence boundaries. Note that age model between ca. 547 Ma and 540 Ma remains poorly constrained. BANE: Basal Nama Excursion, OME: Omkyk Excursion, A0, A3 and A4 named after tentative correlation with radiometrically dated excursions in the A0, A3 and A4 members of the Ara Group, Oman (see text for details). BACE-A, B and C correlate to the positions of the 1n/BACE in models A, B and C, respectively (Table S2). See Fig. 2 for key to lithology and sequence stratigraphy. Radiometric data ( 238 U/ 206 Pb CA-ID-TIMS) are from (Bowring et al., 2007;Linnemann et al., 2019) and italicized data (air abrasion ID-TIMS 207 Pb/ 206 Pb) are from Grotzinger et al. (1995) recalculated in Schmitz (2012) (the age of tuff bed 5 is discounted; details in Table S1). See Fig. S1 for a high-resolution version of this figure . whilst present and radiometrically calibrated in South China, is expressed most completely and with highest resolution in multiple sections by carbonates of the Dabis Formation in both the Zaris and Witputs sub-basins of the Nama Group. This is a recently recognized distinct negative δ 13 Ccarb excursion (Yang et al., 2021), herein termed the basal Nama excursion (BANE, Fig. 1b).</p>
        <p>Subsequent to the BANE, peak δ 13 Ccarb values are reached within the upper Omkyk Member of the Zaris Formation, and lower members of the Dengying Formation. This δ 13 Ccarb peak is herein termed the Omkyk excursion (OME, Fig. 1b).</p>
        <p>The onset of a gradual decline prior to 547.32 ± 0.31 Ma (Bowring et al., 2007) is constrained by a tuff bed within the lower Hoogland Member of the upper Zaris Formation and correlative intervals of the lower Dengying Formation (Table S2). Declining δ 13 Ccarb values culminate in a short-lived (&lt;0.5 Ma) negative excursion, with a recovery to ~0‰ recorded at 546.72 ± 0.21 Ma by a tuff bed in the middle A0 Member of the Ara Group, Oman (see section 5.5, Bowring et al., 2007;Schmitz, 2012). This minor negative excursion is expressed in carbonate interbeds of the Urikos Member of the Zaris Formation, Namibia, and the A0 Member of the Ara Group, Oman (Bowring et al., 2007;Saylor et al., 1998). It may also correspond with a minor negative excursion recorded in the lower Khatyspyt Fm of the northern Siberian Platform (Cui et al., 2016;Knoll et al., 1995), although this remains uncertain (see section 5.3).</p>
        <p>Based on the interbasinal δ 13 Ccarb correlation herein (Fig. 1) and published palaeontological information, carbonates in the lower Kuibis Subgroup (Mara Member of the Dabis Fm) of the Witputs sub-basin host the earliest FAD of Cloudina (Germs, 1983). This FAD may predate the 0‰ recovery from the BANE, however the precise location of the section that hosts the Mara Member cloudinids and associated δ 13 Ccarb data is undocumented. In the Zaris sub-basin, the earliest recorded appearance of cloudinids occurs immediately above the 0‰ recovery from the BANE (~550 Ma) within the lowermost upper Omkyk Member (Fig. 1). Siliciclastics in the lower Kuibis Subgroup (Kliphoek Member of the Dabis Formation) of the Witputs sub-basin, deposited immediately below the 0‰ recovery from the BANE, contain a rich fossil archive of soft-bodied biota (Maloney et al., 2020). The majority of the soft-bodied fossils in this interval correspond to the Nama assemblage, however this level may also host the regional last appearance of elements of the White Sea assemblage, including Ausia fenestrata (Hahn and Pflug, 1985;Pickford, 1995).</p>
        <p>Fossil impressions interpreted as Ausia have previously been noted from the middle Verkhovka Formation of the White Sea area (Grazhdankin, 2004), below a volcanic tuff in the overlying lower Zimnie Gory Formation recently redated to 552.96 ± 0.19 (Yang et al., 2021) (Table S1).</p>
        <p>During deposition of the Schwarzrand Subgroup the locus of carbonate sedimentation shifted to the Witputs sub-basin, and siliciclastic deposits of the Zaris sub-basin record gradual basin infill (Germs, 1983;Gresse and Germs, 1993). The existing δ 13 Ccarb record of the Schwarzrand Subgroup consists of a low resolution δ 13 Ccarb dataset from the Huns and lower Spitskop members of the Urusis Formation, and multiple datasets of varying resolution from the upper Spitskop Member at Farm Swartpunt (Linnemann et al., 2019;Saylor et al., 1998;Wood et al., 2015). We present new δ 13 Ccarb data for two sections from the Urusis Fm (Nord Witputz and Swartpunt), and construct a composite lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic column incorporating available data from the lower Spitskop Member (Saylor et al., 1998) (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>Shallow marine facies of the lower Huns Member at Nord Witputz show initially high δ 13 Ccarb values (max = 4.24‰) that gradually decrease to reach 0.08‰ near the top of the section (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>Higher order variability in the δ 13 Ccarb data of the lower Huns Member may be associated with a series of parasequences, where lower δ 13 Ccarb reflects deepening of the depositional environment.</p>
        <p>Samples of both shallow and marginally deeper facies show pronounced and simultaneous decreases in their mean δ 13 Ccarb composition up-section, which may reflect a gradual trend in seawater δ 13 Ccarb overprinted by minor perturbations associated with regional facies. Based on regional stratigraphic correlation, the Urusis Fm of the Witputs sub-basin was deposited equivalent to siliciclastic deposits of the Schwarzrand Subgroup in the Zaris sub-basin (Germs, 1983), and is therefore likely to be younger than ~546 Ma (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>Namibia. Composite section after (Saylor, 2003). Geological map shows relative positions of measured sections. Map redrawn from Saylor and Grotzinger (1996) using the 1:250000 map of Ai-Ais (2716), Geological Survey of Namibia, Ministry of Mines and Energy. Radiometric data ( 238 U/ 206 Pb CA-ID-TIMS) are from Linnemann et al. (2019) and italicized data (air abrasion ID-TIMS 207 Pb/ 206 Pb) are from Grotzinger et al. (1995) recalculated in Schmitz (2012) (the age of tuff bed 5 is discounted; details in Table S1). BACE-A, B and C correlate to the positions of the 1n/BACE in models A, B and C, respectively (Table S2).</p>
        <p>The lower Spitskop Member contains a volcanic tuff deposit with a 207 Pb/ 206 Pb age of 542.68 ± 1.25 Ma (Grotzinger et al., 1995, recalculated in Schmitz, 2012) (Table S1). Carbon isotope data of relatively low resolution have previously been presented for the lower Spitskop Member from the lower part of a composite section described as 'near Swartkloofberg' (Saylor et al., 1998) (Fig. 2). The lower part of this section (corresponding to medium scale sequences D11 -E16 of Saylor, 2003) lies to the north of our Huns Member section, and the upper part (medium scale sequences E17 and E18 of Saylor, 2003) corresponds to the Swartpunt section (Fig. 2, and see Fig. 1 of Saylor and Grotzinger, 1996). According to Saylor (2003), a total thickness of ~370 m of interbedded shale and carbonate, for which only 18 data points are currently published, separates the Huns Member at Nord Witputz from the upper Spitskop Member at Swartpunt (Fig. 2) (Saylor et al., 1998). However, an alternative correlation for the relative position of the lower Spitskop Member data is discussed in the Supplementary Information. Future high resolution resampling for δ 13 Ccarb, in addition to re-dating of ash beds throughout the lower Spitskop Member southeast of Swartpunt using the updated CA-ID-TIMS methodology, should yield valuable information to better constrain this interval in the global age model.</p>
        <p>The  13 Ccarb record between 546 Ma and 543 Ma remains poorly constrained globally due to a dearth of  13 Ccarb data interbedded with tuff beds dated by reliable radiometric methods (Fig. 3a).</p>
        <p>However, when the new δ 13 Ccarb data of the Huns Member are compared to other δ 13 Ccarb profiles from ca. 546-543 Ma from other cratons (e.g. Yangtze Block, Laurentia, Amazonia and Siberia, Fig. 3), the magnitude and overall trend in the data are consistent with a temporal position coincident with the initial downturn from positive values of up to 5‰ recorded in the middle Member of the Dengying Formation (Gaojiashan Member and equivalent units). We stress that this is a maximum age estimate based on the assumption that the age constraint from the overlying lower Spitskop Member (542.68 ± 1. 25 Ma, Grotzinger et al., 1995, updated in Schmitz, 2012) approximates the true age of the lower Spitskop Member (see Supplementary Text for further discussion). A subsequent recovery to a positive  13 Ccarb peak is well constrained by 5 radiometric ages; 543.40 ± 3.5 Ma from the Baimatuo Member of the Yangtze Platform (Huang et al., 2020), 542.90 ± 0.12 Ma and 542.33 ± 0.11 Ma from the lower and upper A3 Member of the Ara Group (Bowring et al., 2007), and 542.37 ± 0.28 Ma and 541.85 ± 0.75 Ma from the upper Tamengo Formation, Brazil (Parry et al., 2017). Here,  13 Ccarb values increase once more to 3-5.6‰ (herein termed the 'A3' anomaly, Fig. 3) and then decline to a plateau of 0-2‰ prior to 541 Ma (Tables S1 andS2). The available data from the lower Spitskop Member, though sparse, correlate with predominantly positive  13 Ccarb values that precede the negative excursion recorded in the A4 Member of the Ara Group (Fig. 3).</p>
        <p>There are three possible positions for the BACE in the Nama Group, all of which are consistent with available radiometrically-dated tuff deposits and occur in siliciclastic units without  13 Ccarb data (Fig. 2). These give rise to three alternative age models A, B and C (Fig. 3). In each, we assume that the age of the A4 Member accurately constrains the  13 Ccarb excursion recorded in the A4 Member, as shown by Bowring et al. (2007) (see section 5.5 for further discussion of the Ara Group age model). For ease of distinction, the excursion in the A4 Member is herein termed the 'A4 anomaly'. The position of the BACE in relation to the Spitskop Member is inferred either within the shale interval of medium scale sequence E17, stratigraphically beneath the ca. 540 Ma tuff bed at the base of the Swartpunt section (Model A), within the shale interval of medium scale sequence E18 above the well dated horizon constrained by multiple tuff deposits at ca. 539.6 Ma (Linnemann et al., 2019) (Model B), or in strata younger than the Swartpunt section (&lt;538 Ma, Model C) (Figs. 2,3). Models A and B are consistent with a recent radiometric constraint from the La Ciénega Formation, Mexico (Hodgin et al., 2020). However, models B and C imply that the A4 anomaly does not correspond to the BACE, but rather to an earlier negative excursion with a recovery at or before ca. 540 Ma (Figs. 3c and d). In models A and B, the apparent absence of the BACE nadir in the Nama Group is interpreted simply as a function of coincident deposition of outer shelf shale for which δ 13 Ccarb data are lacking (Fig. 2). Indeed, if the A4 anomaly is of global significance and (a) Available radiometric ages with associated internal/analytical uncertainty. See Supplementary Materials (Tables S1 andS2) for references to radiometric and δ 13 Ccarb data, in addition to biostratigraphic and section information. BANE marks the basal Nama negative δ 13 Ccarb excursion, OME marks the positive δ 13 Ccarb peak recorded in the Omkyk Member of the Zaris Formation of the Nama Group, Namibia. A0, A3 and A4 mark the relative positions of δ 13 Ccarb excursions with radiometric ages in the Ara Group, Oman. δ 13 Ccarb peaks 1p-6p, and II-V are labelled after direct correlation with the Sukharikha River section and Lena River sections of Siberia (e.g. Kouchinsky et al., 2007). 1n is equivalent to the BACE in all models. correctly constrained in time (see section 5.5), it is sequestered within a shale interval stratigraphically beneath the Swartpunt section in all models.</p>
        <p>Matching δ 13 Ccarb excursions in fossiliferous Ediacaran sections that display one or more δ 13 Ccarb excursions but lack radiometric ages is complicated by the finding here of multiple global late Ediacaran δ 13 Ccarb excursions. This is equally problematic for the multiple excursions present in the Fortunian Stage of the lower Cambrian. In an attempt to address this issue, we compile a further database of published 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data as an independent chronostratigraphic test (Table S2, Fig. 4). These 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data have been screened on a case-by-case basis using available geochemical data to account for modification of the Sr isotope composition associated with diagenetic alteration or common Rb (see Supplementary Text, Table S2). Reliable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data are anchored directly to the prescribed age of the corresponding δ 13 Ccarb value in the same sample.</p>
        <p>In this way, we are able to constrain trends that we consider the most robust estimate of seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr composition, and use 87 Sr/ 86 Sr as an independent chronostratigraphic indicator for age models A, B and C for sections that lack radiometric ages (Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>Revision of the age of the Shuram excursion after Rooney et al. (2020) and Yang et al. (2021) results in a highly uncertain interval ('WSI' in Figs. 3,4) where 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data are largely unconstrained with the possible exception of values corresponding to the Blueflower Formation of NW Canada (Narbonne et al., 1994). The resulting late Ediacaran 87 Sr/ 86 Sr record (~551 -538 Ma) is characterized by values that are relatively invariant about 0.70842-0.70846, and these values are consistent between Namibia, South China, Mongolia and southeastern Siberia (Table S2). The Khatyspyt Formation yields inconsistent outlier values down to 0.70784 (boxed data in Fig. 4b-d), accompanied by a high degree of scatter in δ 13 Ccarb. The position of the Khatyspyt Formation remains problematic due to uncertainties in the nature of the boundary with the overlying Turkut Formation (see section 5.3). However, we consider the correlation proposed herein to be a reasonable estimate based on consistent δ 13 Ccarb trends between the Khatyspyt Formation and globally distributed sections throughout this interval. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values remain constant throughout much of the Fortunian, but begin to decline approximately coincident with rising δ 13 Ccarb values in Cambrian Stage 2, reaching a nadir of ~0.70805 near the boundary between stages 2 and 3, prior to gradual recovery during upper Stage 3.</p>
        <p>In order to test the validity of our Nama reference curve for global δ 13 Ccarb correlation, and to explore the three alternative age models, we expand our dataset to incorporate published data from correlative strata into the early Cambrian from other cratons and regions (e.g. Yangtze Block, Oman, Laurentia, Amazonia, Morocco, Siberia, Mongolia, Fig. 3). We first prioritise sections with δ 13 Ccarb data and interbedded volcanic deposits dated via zircon U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS. Values of δ 13 Ccarb, anchored by the age of interbedded tuff deposits (within internal/analytical uncertainty) provide the scaffold for wider correlation, and intervals that lack constraint from radiometric ages are considered to be the most uncertain (Tables S1 andS2). Within this framework, we utilize regional sequence stratigraphic models that incorporate gaps in the carbon isotope record of individual sections, due to unconformities or intervals of siliciclastic deposition, while excluding unreasonable sedimentation rates for given tectonic settings (Table S2). Individual sections are subdivided into units of consistent lithofacies, and relative sedimentation rates are permitted to vary accordingly (Table S2). Deeper marine carbonate facies (e.g. organic-rich thinly bedded limestone laminae) and intervals of phosphorite deposition typically exhibit lower rates of deposition than shallow marine carbonate facies (e.g. dolostone and oolitic limestone deposited above fair weather wave base) within each region (Table S2).</p>
        <p>Several high resolution δ 13 Ccarb correlation frameworks have been assembled for the lower Cambrian (e.g. Brasier et al., 1994;Knoll et al., 1995;Kouchinsky et al., 2017Kouchinsky et al., , 2007Kouchinsky et al., , 2005;;Maloof et al., 2010;Smith et al., 2015, Table S2). Our new framework is consistent with that derived by Maloof et al., (2010), but updates their model through incorporation of more recent high resolution δ 13 Ccarb datasets (e.g. Kouchinsky et al., 2017;Smith et al., 2015) and radiometric constraints (e.g. Hodgin et al., 2020;Landing et al., 2020;Linnemann et al., 2019). We also consider updated biostratigraphic information integrated with δ 13 Ccarb from sections in South China (Steiner et al., 2020), Australia (Betts et al., 2018) and Laurentia (Dilliard et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>All global δ 13 Ccarb correlation models reveal widespread, but short-lived, negative excursions in an interval dominated by positive δ 13 Ccarb values in the terminal Ediacaran ~551-538 Ma (Fig. 3e). These models differ most prominently in their correlation of the BACE nadir, either within the latest Ediacaran (models A and B) or within the lowermost Cambrian (Model C), as defined by its position relative to the radiometric age that currently constrains the FAD of T. pedum in Namibia (Fig. 3). However, T. pedum has not been reported in strata older than the BACE nadir in any region that hosts the BACE, and so the BACE nadir may in fact be older than the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary in all models (discussed further below). Models B and C offer valid alternatives to the generally accepted Model A that are consistent with radiometric (models B and C) and stratigraphic (Model C) information in all regions. The relative likelihood of each of these three models, and their biostratigraphic implications, are further discussed below.</p>
        <p>The A4 anomaly records minimum  13 Ccarb values of -5‰ and one outlier value of -6.7‰ (Amthor et al., 2003;Bowring et al., 2007) (Figs. 3 and5). The onset of this negative excursion is anchored by an age of 541.00 ± 0.13 Ma (Bowring et al., 2007). The overlying A5 Member of the Ara Group records stable positive values of 2-3‰, prior to the onset of another negative excursion (Amthor et al., 2003). The radiometric age of the A4 Member has been used to constrain an onset age for the BACE of ~541 Ma (Model A, e.g. Bowring et al., 2007;Hodgin et al., 2020;Linnemann et al., 2019;Maloof et al., 2010). As previously noted, the BACE reaches a nadir of -10‰ and is recorded in all fossiliferous successions with high-resolution  13 Ccarb data, except the Nama Group, Namibia (Figs. 3 and5, Table S2). A maximum age of 539.40 ± 0.23 Ma derives from a sandy dolostone bed in the La Ciénega Formation, Mexico, which lies within negative  13 Ccarb values inferred to correspond to the BACE interval (Tables S1 andS2, Hodgin et al., 2020). However, strata of the upper Spitskop Member of the Urusis Formation (Nama Group, southern Namibia) at the Swartpunt section record relatively stable positive δ 13 Ccarb values about 1‰ that are consistent with values from the A5 Member and constrained by 4 high resolution tuff bed ages between ca. 540 Ma and 539.5 Ma (Figs. 2,3,5,Table S1) (Linnemann et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>In Model A (Fig. 3b), the A4 anomaly and BACE are equivalent and constrained below the Swartpunt section in the shale interval of medium scale sequence E17 (Fig. 2). In this model, the BACE onset is at ca. 541 Ma, constrained in the A4 Member, and the recovery occurs at or before 540 Ma, constrained at the base of Swartpunt section. This is also consistent with the interpreted depositional age being close to the radiometric age determined for the sandy dolostone bed in the La Ciénega Fm, Mexico (Hodgin et al., 2020). However, this implies that 1) the clastic unit that hosts the sandy dolostone bed was deposited at a slower depositional rate above the BACE nadir, 2) the BACE recovery and plateau recorded at Swartpunt are constrained within the clastic horizon of the La Ciénega Fm and are therefore not recorded, and 3) a second more minor negative excursion is recorded above the level of the dolostone bed (possibly equivalent to the onset of 2n or a preceding minor negative excursion).</p>
        <p>In Model A, positive  13 Ccarb values in the uppermost Spitskop Member at Swartpunt may correlate with the 2p interval in Siberia (Kouchinsky et al., 2007), Mongolia (Smith et al., 2015) and possibly Morocco (Maloof et al., 2010), all of which postdate the BACE nadir (Fig. 3b).</p>
        <p>However, in all areas that host high-resolution Fortunian  13 Ccarb records, peaks 2p-4.5p appear to be short-lived positive excursions in an interval dominated by negative mean  13 Ccarb values (Fig. 3e). The duration of the 2p interval implied by the Swartpunt radiometric data therefore appears to contradict the best-fit  13 Ccarb correlations of Fortunian sections (Maloof et al., 2010), notwithstanding the possibility for stratigraphic condensation in other regions at the 2p level (Figs. 3b ande). We consider the caveats associated with the La Ciénega Fm correlation and inconsistencies relating to inferred peak duration between Swartpunt and 2p to make Model A less likely than models B or C for the BACE position, although it remains possible.</p>
        <p>By contrast, models B and C imply that the A4 anomaly and BACE are two distinct excursions, with nadirs that are separated from one another by up to 5 million years . In Model B (Fig. 3c) a return to positive  13 Ccarb values following the A4 anomaly is constrained by the age of 540.095 ± 0.099 Ma at the base of the Swartpunt section, Namibia (Fig. 2) (Linnemann et al., 2019). The BACE onset occurred after ~539.6 Ma, as constrained by three radiometric ages from the Swartpunt section immediately below carbonates that record a decrease in  13 Ccarb to 0‰ (Figs.</p>
        <p>2 and 3c, Table S1, Linnemann et al., 2019), which is consistent with the aforementioned radiometric constraint of 539.4 Ma from the La Ciénega Formation, Mexico (Hodgin et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>In this model, recovery from the BACE in Namibia occurred prior to ~538.6 Ma, consistent with a likely minimum age for the uppermost Spitskop Member at Swartpunt, as constrained by an ash bed age within the overlying Nomtsas Formation at a neighboring section (Linnemann et al., 2019) (Figs. 1 and2). Although this model is consistent with all radiometric constraints, it implies that the BACE was a very short-lived event on the order of 1 Myr. This model demands that some sections (e.g. Sukharikha River) exhibited significantly higher sedimentation rates during the BACE (1n) interval than the overlying 2p-5p interval, which appears inconsistent with the relatively monotonous lithofacies documented throughout.</p>
        <p>Figure 5 presents age Model C for selected successions that host the highest resolution  13 Ccarb data for the critical late Ediacaran to Cambrian Stage 3 (Atdabanian) interval, in regions without significant Fortunian phosphorite deposition. Sections in Morocco, the Zavkhan terrane of Mongolia, and the Siberian Platform have limited Ediacaran-Fortunian radiometric ages, and therefore rely upon best-fit  13 Ccarb correlation throughout this interval. In Model C (Figs. 3d and5), the onset of the BACE is inferred to post-date the Swartpunt section (&lt;538.5 Ma). Stable positive  13 Ccarb values in the interval ~540 -539.5 Ma, as constrained at Swartpunt, separate the A4 anomaly from the BACE with the resulting peak herein termed the Spitskop excursion (SPIE, Figs. 3d and5). Model C implies that 1) the A4 anomaly is distinct from the BACE, and 2) the age derived from the La Ciénega Formation (Hodgin et al., 2020) is best interpreted as detrital (Fig. 5). In this model, the sandy dolostone bed in the La Ciénega Formation was deposited up to 3 Myr after eruption of the incorporated tuffaceous material based on best fit with the  13 Ccarb curve and constant average rates of sedimentation.</p>
        <p>Figure 5 also shows that age-calibrated stratigraphy in many successions record a striking regional lithostratigraphic transition across the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary interval. In many regions, the transition is marked by a widespread erosive unconformity or exposure surface (e.g. Namibia, NE Siberia), and/or a subsequent change in dominant lithofacies which may reflect changes in global sea level. Whilst invoking a eustatic driver for combined litho-and chemostratigraphic variability across this transitional interval is complicated by regional tectonics, this may have significant biostratigraphic implications that warrant future consideration. Model C is our preferred correlation when considering best fit between sections that host continuous Fortunian  13 Ccarb data, whereby dominantly negative  13 Ccarb values are interrupted by short-lived positive excursions (Kouchinsky et al., 2007;Maloof et al., 2010) (e.g. Morocco, Siberia, Figs. 3d, e and 6). This model also permits a short-lived pre-BACE excursion (herein termed 0n) which is recorded in sections with high-resolution δ 13 Ccarb data from Morocco (e.g.</p>
        <p>Oued Sdas and Oued n'Oulili sections, Maloof et al., 2005), Siberia (Sukharikha and Nokhtuysk sections, Kouchinsky et al., 2007;Pelechaty, 1998), Mongolia (Zavkhan terrane, Smith et al., 2015), and possibly Laurentia (Hodgin et al., 2020;Smith et al., 2016) (Figs. 5 and 6).</p>
        <p>Model C also maintains near constant sedimentation rates in multiple Fortunian -Stage 2 sections (Table S2). Taking two of the most continuous carbonate successions known with limited facies variation, Sukharikha River, Siberian Platform, and Zawyat n'Bougzoul, Morocco, we show that while Models A and B both show markedly declining sedimentation rates in both successions, Model C maintains a constant sedimentation rate (Fig. 6). At the resolution of lithostratigraphic detail afforded for each of these sections in the published literature, Model C appears to be the simplest and most parsimonious solution.</p>
        <p>The maximum age for the regional FAD of T. pedum on the Kalahari Craton is associated with the radiometric age of the lower Nomtsas Formation, Namibia (Linnemann et al., 2019). We note, Zawyat n'Bougzoul section (Anti-Atlas, Morocco), with lithostratigraphy and δ 13 Ccarb after Kouchinsky et al. (2007) and Maloof et al. (2005), respectively. See Fig. 2 for key to lithology and sequence stratigraphy. however, that T. pedum has not been reported from the section (Farm Swartkloofberg, Linnemann et al., 2019) from which this radiometric age is derived. Instead, the FAD of T. pedum is reported from entirely siliciclastic valley fill deposits of the Nomtsas Formation on Farms Sonntagsbrunn and Vergelee, &gt;100 km to the east of Farm Swartkloofberg (Table S3). By contrast, the FAD of T. pedum in Laurentia is well constrained above the nadir of the BACE recorded in carbonate interbeds of the Esmeralda Member of the Deep Spring Formation, Nevada (Fig. 5c, Smith et al., 2016). If Model C is correct, then the integrated  13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Mount Dunfee section may imply a far younger age for the FAD of T. pedum (~535.5 Ma), and by extension the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, than currently defined (Fig. 5). This may therefore also support a case for repositioning the Ediacaran-Cambrian GSSP to the Mount Dunfee section based on the best-fit calibration of the FAD of T. pedum.</p>
        <p>The process of constructing these age models has exposed the largest remaining uncertainties in late Ediacaranearly Cambrian stratigraphic correlation, which occur mainly due to insufficient radiometric control. Despite these uncertainties, we build on the biostratigraphic framework of Maloof et al. (2010) and constrain the FADs of key Cambrian-type small skeletal fossil groups within each age model (Table S2).</p>
        <p>High resolution δ 13 Ccarb and sequence stratigraphic assessment of Cryogenian and early Ediacaran carbonates of the Congo Craton has revealed significant facies-dependency in the expression of presumed-global δ 13 Ccarb excursions (Hoffman and Lamothe, 2019). In their model, Hoffman &amp; Lamothe (2019) propose that the observed multimodal δ 13 Ccarb expression between inner platform, basin margin and upper foreslope carbonates may be associated with significant facies-dependent distinction relating to seawater vs sediment-buffered diagenesis. They note that this may significantly complicate the utility of δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphic studies throughout geological time, especially where radiometric anchor-points are absent or sparse. Anomalously positive δ 13 Ccarb values of the middle Bambuí Group of Brazil, stratigraphically above Cloudinabearing carbonates, also clearly demonstrate offset from global seawater composition (Uhlein et al., 2019). This offset is interpreted to reflect local effects of unusual water column chemistry that likely result from partial restriction (Cui et al., 2020b;Uhlein et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>In our models, a number of regions show a degree of scatter in δ 13 Ccarb, with possible evidence for deviation from the idealized seawater δ 13 Ccarb curve. Examples include the Zuun-Arts and Salaany Gol formations (Mongolia), and potential δ 13 Ccarb bimodality between different facies across the Yangtze Block (South China). In particular, the negative excursions at ca. 546.5 Ma (A0) and 541 Ma (A4), which may be globally widespread, are significantly muted in sections of the Yangtze Block. Whether the excursions themselves, or the muted record in South China, best reflect true changes in seawater composition as opposed to degrees of diagenetic alteration or restriction, remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>Resolving the possible multimodal nature of Ediacaran and lower Cambrian δ 13 Ccarb records will benefit from future radiometric calibration, in addition to high-resolution studies of integrated stratigraphic, petrographic, δ 44/40 Ca and δ 26 Mg analyses (e.g. Ahm et al., 2021;Bold et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Whilst this frustrates the utility of the proposed global δ 13 Ccarb correlation for regional chemostratigraphic studies of unfossiliferous strata with limited radiometric constraints throughout this time interval, we note that it does not alter proposed FADs and LADs of key taxa.</p>
        <p>We tentatively suggest that the broad trends observed in δ 13 Ccarb represented by gradual, unidirectional shifts in δ 13 Ccarb, are consistent between sections but that the absolute magnitude of positive and negative excursions may differ depending on the specifics of local diagenetic alteration and/or steepness of the local isotopic gradient of seawater during organic carbon remineralisation. We note that this assumption holds true even for the Cryogenian interglacial interval, with the possible exception of the interval recording the Taishir anomaly (Hoffman and Lamothe, 2019). In this regard, and given the stratigraphic alternatives considered herein (Fig. 2), we do not consider the stable, positive δ 13 Ccarb data of the Swartpunt section to necessarily correlate with the nadir of the BACE, as has previously been suggested (e.g. Hodgin et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>In models A to C, the shape of the global composite δ 13 Ccarb curve between ~547 Ma and 543</p>
        <p>Ma is dictated in large part by the age of the base of the Dengying Fm of the Yangtze Platform, South China, and the shape of the Dengying Fm δ 13 Ccarb profile. Detailed litho-, chemo-, and sequence stratigraphic studies of the Ediacaran Yangtze Platform are numerous (e.g. An et al., 2015;Condon et al., 2005;Cui et al., 2016;Cui et al., 2019;Ishikawa et al., 2008;Li et al., 2013;Lu et al., 2013;Tahata et al., 2013;Wang et al., 2014Wang et al., , 2017;;Yang et al., 2021;C. Zhou et al., 2017b;Zhu et al., 2007Zhu et al., , 2013)). A summary description of the Dengying Fm, and detailed section correlation figures (Figs. S3 andS4) are provided herein for reference.</p>
        <p>The Dengying Fm is lithostratigraphically subdivided into three members, each of which have differing names that correspond to geographic position on the Yangtze Platform (Fig. S3). The lower Member is dominated by dolostone that was deposited during a sea level highstand atop black shale of Member IV of the Doushantuo Formation (Zhu et al., 2007). This unit corresponds to the Algal Dolomite and Donglongtan members on the shallow Yangtze platform to the north and west, respectively, where it reaches thicknesses of &gt;280m. In the Yangtze Gorges area to the east, the equivalent Hamajing Member ranges in thickness from 3-60m in sections measured for δ 13 Ccarb (Fig. S3), but may reach a maximum thickness of 200m (Jiang et al., 2007;Zhu et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>A sequence boundary separates dolostone of the lower Dengying Fm from overlying fossiliferous deeper marine deposits of the middle Dengying Fm across the Yangtze Platform (Zhu et al., 2007). In the north, this unit corresponds to fossiliferous transgressive siliciclastics and limestones of the Gaojiashan Member (20-45m) (Cui et al., 2016;Cui et al., 2019;Zhu et al., 2007). Equivalent transgressive deposits of the middle Dengying Fm correspond to shale of the Jiucheng Member (20-45m) in the west, and bituminous limestone of the richly fossiliferous Shibantan Member (up to &gt;100m) in the Yangtze Gorges area to the east (Duda et al., 2016;Xiao et al., 2020;Zhu et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>The third and topmost Member of the Dengying Fm is composed of highstand systems tract dolostones, which are frequently capped by a sequence boundary that shows evidence for exposure. In the north and west, this unit corresponds to the Beiwan (25-370m) and Baiyanshao (≤120m) members, respectively, which correlate with the Baimatuo Member (≤400m) in the Yangtze Gorges area (Zhu et al., 2007). Zircons within an ash layer 45m above the base of the Baimatuo Member at the Zhoujiaao section (central south Huangling anticline, Fig. S1) have been dated by U-Pb SIMS to 543.40 ± 3.5 Ma (Huang et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>A zircon U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS age of 550.14 ± 0.63 Ma (Yang et al., 2021) from an ash bed at the top of Member IV (Miaohe Member) of the Doushantuo Fm at Jiuqunao section of the western Huangling anticline (Fig. S3) is classically considered to constrain a maximum age for the base of the Dengying Fm (Condon et al., 2005). The Dengying Fm in the Jiuqunao section records recovery from a negative δ 13 Ccarb excursion characterised by increasing δ 13 Ccarb from -4.05‰ to +3.56‰ in &lt;3m of dolostone (Fig. S3) (Condon et al., 2005;Yang et al., 2021;Zhu et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, lithostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic correlation between sections of the western Huangling anticline at the boundary between the Doushantuo and Dengying formations is complicated by slumping and associated stratigraphic repetition (Fig. S3) (An et al., 2015;Vernhet, 2007;Yang et al., 2021;Zhou et al., 2017b). Furthermore, the ~550 Ma ash layer at Jiuqunao section has not been reported at the top of Doushantuo Member IV, or elsewhere, from any other section on the Yangtze Platform to date.</p>
        <p>Here we consider a further alternative model (Model D) that explores the implications of correlating the δ 13 Ccarb data above the 550 Ma ash bed at Jiuqunao with the upper Hamajing Mb, rather than the basal Hamajing Mb (Fig. S4). In this model, the 550 Ma ash layer represents the age of slumping in the western Huangling anticline, and was deposited at the top of the disrupted unit, thereby permitting a conformable contact between the ash horizon and the overlying Dengying Fm at Jiuqunao section. The sequence stratigraphic framework for the entire Dengying Fm in sections across the Yangtze Platform and slope presented by Zhu et al. (2007) 7d). In Model D, the global δ 13 Ccarb curve between 546.5 Ma and 541 Ma is characterised by a simple increase and decrease (Fig. 7b), from A0 to A3 and culminating in the A4 excursion (which may or may not correspond with the BACE).</p>
        <p>The temporal placement of the Khatyspyt Formation of the Olenek Uplift is key to understanding the degree of assemblage overlap between the Avalon, White Sea and Nama assemblages, as it contains typical Avalon assemblage fossils including the rangeomorphs Charnia masoni and Khatyspytia grandis (e.g. Cui et al., 2016). The age of the Khatyspyt Formation also has significant implications for the evolution and morphological changes in macroalgae during the late Ediacaran (Bykova et al., 2020). The Khatyspyt Formation has long been assumed to record deposition between ca. 560 and 550 Ma, approximately contemporaneously with the Miaohe Member and fossiliferous deposits of the White Sea area (e.g. Cui et al., 2016). In fact, the only radiometric constraint available is a maximum age for intrusion of the volcanic breccia of the Tas-Yuryakh volcanic complex within the lower part of the Syhargalakh Formation (lower Kessyusa Group), which unconformably overlies the Khatyspyt and overlying Turkut formations. The maximum age for intrusion of this unit is 542.8±1.30 Ma, provided by zircon U-Pb air abrasion ID-TIMS (Table S1) (Bowring et al., 1993;Maloof et al., 2010;Rogov et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding uncertainties in this age (Table S1), the Turkut Formation, which overlies the Khatyspyt Formation, contains the local FAD of the anabaritid Cambrotubulus decurvatus and the onset of a negative excursion which may be equivalent either to the A4 anomaly or the BACE (depending on the preferred model, Figs. 3 and4). Screened 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data for the Khatyspyt Formation (boxed data in Fig. 4b-d) are notably depleted (mean = 0.708038, n = 19, Cui et al., 2016;Vishnevskaya et al., 2017Vishnevskaya et al., , 2013) ) relative to all screened data prior to the nadir in upper Cambrian Stage 2 (Table S2). Recent efforts to produce a global late Ediacaran 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compilation suggest that the low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data recorded by the Khatyspyt Formation are supportive of a temporal placement approximately coincident with and postdating data from the Nama Group (Cui et al., 2020a). Potential issues with this correlation are outlined below.</p>
        <p>Carbon isotope data from the Nama Group are anchored at various levels to high precision radiometric ages (e.g. Bowring et al., 2007;Linnemann et al., 2019), and reveal trends in δ 13 Ccarb that are correlatable in other, globally distributed and similarly temporally well-constrained sections (e.g. Ara Group, Oman, Amthor et al., 2003;Bowring et al., 2007). Robust 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data from the Nama Group are recorded from samples spanning the Omkyk Member (Zaris Formation) to the Nomtsas Formation, with relatively invariable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (mean = 0.708538, n = 11) (Kaufman et al., 1993). Furthermore, high Sr limestones from the Shibantan Member, South China and the Zuun-Arts and overlying Bayan-Gol formations of the Zavkhan Terrane, Mongolia, show robust 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and δ 13 Ccarb trends consistent with the record from the Nama Group, with the latter extending relatively stable values of ~0.708500 into the lower Fortunian (Fig. 4b-d, Table S2, Brasier et al., 1996). In light of available robust δ 13 Ccarb and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data from radiometrically well-constrained sections, our compilation suggests either: 1) that low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values and an Avalon-type biotic assemblage support an older temporal placement for the Khatyspyt Formation than that shown in our compilation (&gt;551 Ma and possibly as old as ~575 Ma), or 2) that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data recorded by the Khatyspyt Formation are not representative of global seawater composition. The nature of the contact between the Khatypsyt and Turkut formations along the Khorbusuonka River is key to determining the true placement of the Khatyspyt Formation, and reports vary considerably. For example, Cui et al. (2016) report that the boundary between the Khatyspyt and Turkut formations is conformable, whereas Vishnevskaya et al. (2017) suggest that this is an unconformable contact. However, neither publication provides figured evidence of the nature of the contact.</p>
        <p>In our correlation, we tentatively assume that the hiatus (if any) at the boundary between these two formations along the Khorbusuonka River is relatively minor (&lt;500 kyrs). This is justified in part by the consistency in δ 13 Ccarb and lithostratigraphy between late Ediacaran sections of the Olenek uplift and the Nama and Ara groups (Figs. 3 and5). However, we stress that this requires future clarification due to the unusually low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data of the Khatyspyt Formation in this time interval. If the boundary is conformable, the presence of Avalon-type fossils in the Khatyspyt Formation, in addition to Charniodiscus noted from the Shibantan Member (Chen et al., 2014), together suggest that rare remnants of the Avalon assemblage remained until possibly as late as ca. 545.5 Ma. It is noteworthy that ordination plots of the overall late Ediacaran fossil assemblages have not placed the Khatyspyt assemblage within the Avalon-type biotas and instead place it with the younger White Sea biota (Boag et al., 2016). The temporal overlap between the Avalon and Nama assemblages also holds true regardless of the age of the Khatyspyt Formation, as the age of the Shibantan Member is confidently constrained (&lt; ca. 551 Ma) by the aforementioned radiometric age of the volcanic tuff deposit in the underlying upper Miaohe Member (Condon et al., 2005;Schmitz, 2012;Yang et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>A maximum age for intrusion of the Tas-Yuryakh volcanic breccia within the lower Syhargalakh Formation (lower Kessyusa Group) along the Khorbusuonka River is suggested by a zircon U-Pb air abrasion ID-TIMS age of 542.8 ± 1.30 Ma (Table S1) (Bowring et al., 1993;Maloof et al., 2010;Rogov et al., 2015). The intrusive Tas-Yuryakh volcanic breccia unconformably overlies the Turkut Formation. The FAD of the anabaritid Cambrotubulus decurvatus is recorded from the lower Turkut Formation in this section (Rogov et al., 2015), which supports a late Ediacaran lower boundary for the regional Nemakit-Daldynian Stage of Siberia, consistent with biostratigraphy and δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy in sections along the Yudoma River of SE Siberia (Zhu et al., 2017). δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic studies support temporal placement of the Turkut Formation of the Khorbusuonka River correlative with the middle -upper Ust'-Yudoma Formation in sections along the Yudoma River (Knoll et al., 1995;Pelechaty, 1998;Pelechaty et al., 1996bPelechaty et al., , 1996a;;Zhu et al., 2017). Indeed, if the age of the Tas-Yuryakh volcanic breccia is close to the minimum age within analytical uncertainty, then the negative excursion recorded at the top of the Turkut Formation (Knoll et al., 1995) is equivalent to the A4 anomaly, and either corresponds with (Model A) or precedes (models B and C) the BACE. In both scenarios, the lower Turkut Formation and middle Ust'-Yudoma Formation at Kyra-Ytyga contain the earliest known FADs of anabaritids globally (≥541 Ma, Fig. 8). It is likely that future high precision CA-ID-TIMS analyses significantly alter the temporal position of the Tas-Yuryakh volcanic breccia, and by extension the minimum age of the underlying Turkut Formation. In the age models presented herein, a maximum age for the FAD of SSFs of the Anabarites trisulcatus -Protohertzina anabarica Zone (and by extension the Nemakit-Daldynian lower boundary) is therefore set at ca. 541-542 Ma across the Siberian Platform (Fig. 8). This temporal placement is most consistent with the dominant  13 Ccarb trends observed pre-BACE, whereby positive  13 Ccarb values are interrupted by short-lived negative excursions (Fig. 3e).</p>
        <p>A complication inherent in the chemostratigraphic assessment of the Ara Group is the nature of the carbonate units themselves, which are found as 'stringers', frequently interbedded by evaporite (Amthor et al., 2003;Bowring et al., 2007). We note that whilst the high precision radiometric ages provided by Bowring et al. (2007) confidently place these carbonate units in relative stratigraphic order, the analysed tuffaceous material and  13 Ccarb datasets do not always derive from the same core. For example, the A0  13 Ccarb excursion is recorded within the Sabsab-1 well, whereas the radiometric constraint of ~546.72 Ma derives from a tuff bed in the Asala-1 well.  13 Ccarb data for the Asala-1 well remain unpublished, precluding confident calibration of this  13 Ccarb excursion. Indeed, the only two wells for which both radiometric and  13 Ccarb data are available are BB-5 and Minha-1. Whilst BB-5 constrains the A4 anomaly, Minha-1 captures positive  13 Ccarb values in the A3 Member that are in agreement with radiometrically constrained  13 Ccarb data from Brazil (Parry et al., 2017) and South China (Huang et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>We note that some other globally-distributed sections record an excursion that is demonstrably pre-BACE (e.g. Zuun-Arts Formation), which may be more consistent with an earlier, distinct 'A4' anomaly. The A5 Member of the Ara Group also records a δ 13 Ccarb plateau of similar magnitude to that recorded at Swartpunt (Figs. 5a,b), followed by a gradual decrease in δ 13 Ccarb that mirrors the decrease seen above the level of the ca. 539.6 Ma horizon at Swartpunt (Figs. 2 and5a, b).</p>
        <p>These features may add credence to a pre-BACE 'A4' anomaly (models B and C).</p>
        <p>Recent biostratigraphic and δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphic assessment of Ediacaran -Cambrian transitional strata of the Yangtze Platform, South China have shown a previously underappreciated level of δ 13 Ccarb variability in the post-BACE, pre-ZHUCE (Zhujiaqing positive δ 13 Ccarb excursion) interval (Steiner et al., 2020). In age models A and B, the BACE is constrained to be late Ediacaran in age, with a nadir either at ca. 541 (Model A) or ca. 539 Ma (Model B, Figs. 3 and9, Table S2).</p>
        <p>In Model C, the BACE is within the basal Cambrian based on correlation with the radiometric age and inferred maximum FAD of T. pedum in the Nomtsas Fm (Fig. 10). However, as noted above, the FAD of T. pedum is constrained to be post-BACE in all successions that host the BACE, which may also support an Ediacaran age for the BACE in Model C. The BACE is well-recorded in sections across the Yangtze Platform, South China, in the lower Zhujiaqing Formation (Daibu Member) and Yanjiahe Formation, and is commonly overlain by phosphorus-rich carbonates of the middle Zhujiaqing Formation (Zhongyicun Member) and equivalent units (Brasier et al., 1990;Steiner et al., 2020). Phosphorite deposition is globally widespread in lower Fortunian strata (e.g. Tarim, Yangtze Platform, Malyi Karatau of Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, some sections of Laurentia), with carbonate substituted in the phosphorite lattice commonly recording very negative, or highly variable δ 13 Ccarb values that diverge from global seawater composition. The upper Yanjiahe Formation, above the level of the BACE, yields highly variable δ 13 Ccarb values alongside SSFs of the A. trisulcatus -P. anabarica assemblage Zone (Steiner et al., 2020). The Kuanchuanpu Formation yields similarly variable δ 13 Ccarb values and SSFs (Steiner et al., 2020;B. Yang et al., 2016). Crucially, the lower Kuanchuanpu Formation records the co-occurrence of Cloudina with SSFs of the A. trisulcatus -P. anabarica Zone (B. Yang et al., 2016), however the exact position of this mixed assemblage relative to the BACE nadir remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>In areas where phosphorite deposition is limited, the δ 13 Ccarb composition of Fortunian-age global seawater is more faithfully recorded (e.g. Siberia, Morocco, Mongolia), and appears to show high frequency excursions (including peaks 2p-4p) that record a gradual increase in δ 13 Ccarb towards a large positive excursion (5p) (Figs. 3b-d, 5d-f) (Kouchinsky et al., 2007;Maloof et al., 2010;Smith et al., 2015). Crucially, however, this interval of high frequency δ 13 Ccarb variability suffers from a significant dearth of radiometric anchor-points, robust differentiation in SSF zonation, or differentiation of δ 13 Ccarb peaks of distinct magnitude. Sections of the Anti-Atlas Mountains in Morocco and along the Sukharikha River of northwest Siberia have been proposed as continuous reference sections for correlative trends in Fortunian global seawater δ 13 C (Kouchinsky et al., 2007;Maloof et al., 2010). However, the absolute magnitude and number of peaks are thought to vary between and within regions (e.g. Smith et al., 2015). At present, the published section information in both of these areas is insufficiently detailed to accurately constrain the position of individual exposure surfaces. We note that the Fortunian remains the interval of greatest uncertainty in our correlation and demands future targeted study, integrating high resolution chemostratigraphic data with detailed sedimentological, biostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic information and, where possible, high resolution radiometric age constraints. Higher resolution δ 13 Ccarb datasets may also permit more statistically significant peak correlation through use of dynamic programming algorithms, as has been demonstrated for Atdabanian successions of Morocco (Hay et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Below we consider alternative temporal positions for the ZHUCE and the excursion recorded in the Salaany Gol Formation. For ease of reference, alternative correlations are incorporated into Model A relative to models B and C, however their relative positions and uncertainties should be considered in isolation.</p>
        <p>The upper Zhujiaqing Formation (Dahai Member) of the Yangtze Platform records a prominent positive δ 13 Ccarb excursion with an onset approximately coincident with the FADs of the mollusks Aldanella attleborensis and Watsonella crosbyi (Figs. 8-10, Table S3, Li et al., 2011;Parkhaev and Karlova, 2011;Steiner et al., 2020). The FAD of Watsonella crosbyi occurs prior to the apex of 5p, or immediately following recovery from 5p in sections of the western Anabar Shield, and may be approximately contemporaneous in the Bayangol Fm of the Zavkhan Terrane, Mongolia (Kouchinsky et al., 2017;Smith et al., 2015) (but see section 5.8). Peak 5p is followed by 6p in Cambrian Stage 2 strata of Siberia and Morocco, but the relative position of the singular excursion recorded in the Dahai Member has been problematic (Steiner et al., 2020). Possible regional variability in the magnitude of the ZHUCE in South China, in addition to widespread phosphorite deposition of the underlying Zhongyicun Member in some areas of the Yangtze Platform, complicates the utility of δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy for accurately determining the correct correlation of the peak recorded in the Dahai Member (Steiner et al., 2020). S2) may instead represent a tommotiid fragment; however, this cannot be confirmed due to the poor quality of the specimen.</p>
        <p>Model A (Figs. 3b,8a,9b,c) shows the result of correlating the ZHUCE with 5p, which may be more consistent with a depositional hiatus of longer duration that separates the Dahai Member from the overlying Shiyantou Formation. In this correlation, the FAD of tommotiids in South China significantly predates Siberia (Fig. 8a), and maximum δ 13 Ccarb values of the Dahai Member are greater than 5p in the Siberian and Moroccan profiles. However, Model A results in a relatively consistent (possibly slightly earlier) FAD of the mollusks Watsonella and Aldanella relative to Siberia (Fig. 9c), whereas Model B results in a slightly delayed FAD of these genera in South China (Figs. 8b and9f). The correlation of ZHUCE with 5p is also supported by SSF biostratigraphy of the Yanjiahe Fm, where peak values in Unit 3 occur within the SSF Zone 2 (Purella antiqua), which would be consistent with a pre-5p excursion in other localities.</p>
        <p>In models B and C, the ZHUCE is correlated with peak 6p (Figs. 3c,d,8b,c,9f,10c) and negative δ 13 Ccarb values associated with phosphatic lithologies of the Zhongyicun Member are not considered useful for global chemostratigraphic correlation. Correlation of the ZHUCE with 6p may be justified by the best fit of δ 13 Ccarb data (particularly maximum values at Xiaotan section), but also by recognition of the more consistent age for the resulting FAD of tommotiids in South China relative to Siberia (Fig. 8b,c). In Model B, positive δ 13 Ccarb in Yanjiahe Unit 3 are correlated with peak 5p, and peak 6p is absent from this formation in recognition of the depositional hiatus separating the Yanjiahe Formation from the overlying Shuijingtuo Formation (Steiner et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Robust differentiation between these correlations is currently hampered by a lack of radiometric data and discontinuous carbonate sections from this interval in South China. Transbaikalian terranes and occur permanently below the first trilobites in each area (Debrenne et al., 2015;Dyatlova and Sycheva, 1999;Osadchaya and Kotel'nikov, 1998;Zhuravleva et al., 1997). In turn, this first trilobite species assemblage is also the same and belongs to the Resimopsis trilobite Zone, which contains species of the middle Atdabanian (Stage 3) Repinaella trilobite Zone of the Siberian Platform and lacks any earlier trilobite elements (Astashkin et al., 1995;Korobov, 1989Korobov, , 1980)). Landing and Kruse (2017) noted these inconsistencies and suggested that the positive δ 13 Ccarb excursion in the lower Salaany Gol Formation is rather an equivalent of the middle Atdabanian δ 13 Ccarb excursion IV of the Siberian Platform, which fits better to both archaeocyath and trilobite biostratigraphies. The other suggestion of Smith et al. (2015) concerning the absence S3). Black dotted line marks the temporal position of the 1n/BACE nadir. Red dashed line marks the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary as defined by the maximum age for the first appearance datum of Treptichnus pedum. Note that uncertainty remains in ichnofossil assignment of the traces in the Mistaken Point Formation of Avalonia (Warren et al., 2020). S3). Black dotted line marks the temporal position of the 1n/BACE nadir. Red dashed line marks the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary as defined by the maximum age for the first appearance datum of Treptichnus pedum. In this figure, the FAD of T. pedum is interpreted to post-date the BACE nadir in all regions (max.</p>
        <p>FAD in upper Esmeralda Mb, Nevada, Fig. 5c), and the age of the lower Nomtsas Fm at Swartkloofberg section does not anchor the FAD of T. pedum in Namibia (see discussion in Section 4). Key provided in Fig. 9.</p>
        <p>of upper Atdabanian and Botoman (stages 3 and 4) faunal elements from the Salaany Gol Formation is correct and supported by the restudy of archaeocyath species assemblage, which is the same through the entire formation (Cordie et al., 2019;Debrenne et al., 2015;Zhuravlev, 1998).</p>
        <p>We agree with Smith et al. (2015) that the magnitude of the positive δ 13 Ccarb excursion reported from the Salaany Gol Formation fits well with peak 6p on the reference scale, but greatly exceeds the magnitude of peak IV (Figs. 3, 5f, Table S2). However, we also note that the regional δ 13 Ccarb record from the Zavkhan terrane throughout the underlying Zuun-Arts and Bayangol formations frequently exhibits more extreme values (positive and negative) relative to other late Ediacaran and lower Cambrian records from Siberia, Morocco and elsewhere. Models B and C (Figs. 3c,d,8b,c,9e,f,10b,c) reposition the Salaany Gol Formation to the Atdabanian, with the uppermost Bayan Gol Formation occupying a position relative to peak 6p, and implies poor expression of peak 5p, possibly within lower Member BG5 of Smith et al. (2015) (Fig. 5f). We stress, however, that peak correlation throughout the Fortunian and Stage 2 of Mongolia, and globally, remains poorly constrained.</p>
        <p>The Arrowie and Stansbury basins contain a rich assemblage of lower Cambrian fossils, including the regional first appearance of archaeocyaths, trilobites, bradoriids and tommotiids. Betts et al. (2019Betts et al. ( , 2018Betts et al. ( , 2017aBetts et al. ( , 2017bBetts et al. ( , 2016) ) and Jago et al. (2020) refined the lower Cambrian biostratigraphy for South Australia developed by Daily (1990Daily ( , 1972)), Laurie (1986), Gravestock (1984), Bengtson et al. (1990), Zhuravlev and Gravestock (1994), and Gravestock et al. (2001) and added δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy. Contrary to previous workers, Betts et al. (2019Betts et al. ( , 2018Betts et al. ( , 2017aBetts et al. ( , 2017bBetts et al. ( , 2016) ) and Jago et al. (2020) suggested that lower units of fossiliferous strata of the Arrowie and Stansbury basins be repositioned to stages 2 and 3 instead of stages 3 and 4, respectively. These justifications were mostly based on tommotiid biostratigraphy, with little reference to other biostratigraphic constraints. However, Australian tommotiids are highly endemic species and some genera are unknown even beyond the Australian-Antarctic faunal province of Gondwana, while other faunal elements, including archaeocyaths, trilobites, bradoriids, mollusks and brachiopods are much more widespread, although at the generic level (Bengtson et al., 1990;Betts et al., 2017b;Brock et al., 2000;Gravestock et al., 2001;Laurie, 1986). In dismissing the biostratigraphic value of archaeocyaths, for instance, these authors arrive at a correlation of their Kulparina rostrata tommotiid Zone and the regionally pre-trilobitic portion of their succeeding Micrina etheridgei Zone with the Cambrian Stage 2, even though these zones collectively coincide with the Warriootacyathus wilkawillinensis, Spirillicyathus tenuis and Jugalicyathus tardus archaeocyath zones (Zhuravlev and Gravestock, 1994), dated as Atdabanian in Siberian terms (Stage 3). Likewise, comparison of archaeocyath genera in common with South China indicates a correlation with trilobite-bearing upper Qiongzhusian-lower Canglangpuan (Stage 3) strata in that region (A. Yang et al., 2016). The same conclusions contradicting the correlations of Betts et al. (2018Betts et al. ( , 2017a) ) follow from analysis of the biostratigraphic distribution of any other fossil group present in these tommotiid-based zones, including bradoriids, brachiopods (Kruse et al., 2017) and mollusks (Parkhaev, 2019a). In general, tommotiids and coeval early small shelly fossils in South Australia are not indicative of the Terreneuvian because representatives of all other co-occurring fossil groups (archaeocyaths, bradoriids, brachiopods, mollusks) are restricted to post-Terreneuvian strata in Siberia, South China, Laurentia and other regions, and more precisely to global stages 3 and 4 (Kruse et al., 2017;Parkhaev, 2019a), which suggests different, younger ages for some of the δ 13 Ccarb peaks, rather than those accepted by Betts et al. (2018). In our correlation, we have repositioned some of these Australian δ 13 Ccarb data to maintain consistency with both the regional stratigraphic correlation of Betts et al. (2018) and biostratigraphic constraints that are more globally applicable (Figs. 9 and 10, Table S2).</p>
        <p>Our revised correlations have important implications both for the late Ediacaran global  13 Ccarb profile and for macroevolutionary dynamics across the BACE interval. Combining the temporal and spatial distribution of major Ediacaran-Cambrian shelly and trace fossils into these new global δ 13 Ccarb, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and geochronological records, together with older Ediacaran radiometric dates, allows us to establish temporal and spatial paleobiogeographic trends that significantly diverge from the accepted consensus (Figs. 8-11; Table S3). These trends are robust despite remaining uncertainties, and crucially, all age models show the same macroevolutionary trends across the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary interval . Namely, that multiple negative δ 13 Ccarb excursions are present in the late Ediacaran record, which do not clearly correlate with extinction events and that SSFs of the A. trisulcatus -P. anabarica Zone appeared below the BACE.</p>
        <p>The available radiometric age constraints for the interval of ~580-538 Ma confirm the temporal overlap of elements of the Avalon, White Sea and Nama assemblages of the Ediacaran biota, rather than forming discrete successive assemblages, with the White Sea assemblage being entirely transitional (Grazhdankin, 2014;Yang et al., 2021). Consistent with previous models, the Ediacaran biota show a marked decline in diversity ~550, and again ~545 Ma (Boag et al., 2016;Grazhdankin, 2014;Muscente et al., 2019). Elements of the Avalon and White Sea assemblages inhabited different basins contemporaneously in the White Sea and Podolia regions of Baltica, and Australia, until ~552 Ma (Gehling and Droser, 2013;Grazhdankin, 2014), although the age range of fossiliferous strata of the Ediacara Member remains poorly constrained. Both the Avalon and White Sea assemblages largely disappeared by ~550 Ma, however some elements of the Avalon assemblage (e.g. Charniodiscus) and White Sea assemblage (e.g. possible Dickinsonia sp.) were likely present until as late as ~545.5 Ma in South China and possibly northern Siberia (e.g. Xiao et al., 2020). After this time, taxa of the Nama assemblage remained present in the Nama Basin, Namibia, the Erga Formation of the White Sea region, the Shibantan Member of the Yangtze Block, South China, and the Wood Canyon Formation of Laurentia. Successions of Armorica (Spain) and SW Gondwana (Brazil and Paraguay) also host skeletal assemblages of Cloudina, Namacalathus and Corumbella (Adôrno et al., 2017;Cortijo et al., 2010;Warren et al., 2011), however these successions remain poorly constrained in time &lt;550 Ma due to a dearth of high resolution δ 13 Ccarb data. Fossils of the Palaeopascichnus group may have extended below ~560 Ma in the Shuram-Wonoka negative excursion interval in South Australia. However, these taxa are known from ~547-545 Ma in Siberia (Aim Formation), South China (Gaojiashan and Shibantan members, and Liuchapo Formation) and Namibia (Schwarzrand Subgroup), and may show their greatest range in eastern Newfoundland, where they are found below a Gaskiers age diamictite (&gt;580 Ma) and even co-occur with T. pedum above the basal Cambrian GSSP (Table S3).</p>
        <p>Treptichnid trace fossils pre-date the inferred nadir of the BACE in Namibia, and Cambriantype shelly fossils of the Anabarites trisulcatus -Protohertzina anabarica Zone predate the nadir of the BACE in Siberia and predate or co-occur with the nadir of the BACE in South China (Cai et al., 2019;Jensen et al., 2000;Zhu et al., 2017). Diverse and complex ichnofossils also predate the T. pedum FAD in a number of sections (e.g. Chen et al., 2019;Gozalo et al., 2003;Jensen et al., 2000;Zhu et al., 2017). At least three soft-bodied genera of the Nama assemblage are present in the Nama Basin, Namibia, post-dating (Model A), coeval with (Model B), or pre-dating (Model C) the inferred position of the BACE, and both Cloudina and Namacalathus occur above the inferred recovery from the A4 anomaly in the same section in all models (Fig. 2, Darroch et al., 2015;Narbonne et al., 1997;Wood et al., 2015). There are currently no environments that show unequivocal co-occurrence of the Cambrian ichnospecies T. pedum and Ediacaran skeletal fossils Cloudina or Namacalathus. These taxa, as well as Nenoxites (= Shaanxilithes in South China) became extinct at or before the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, as defined by the FAD of T. pedum, but significantly these extinctions were regional, rather than global events (e.g. Cloudina LAD may be as early as ~542.3 Ma in Oman (Bowring et al., 2007), but occurred after ~539.6 Ma in Namibia (Linnemann et al., 2019)).</p>
        <p>Model C may support a range extension for erniettomorphs in Laurentia associated with the BACE nadir, to an age that is within the lower Cambrian as presently defined (Figs. 5 and 10).</p>
        <p>However, Model C may also imply a younger age for the FAD of T. pedum (and hence the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary) if this ichnospecies is restricted to a position above the BACE recovery as suggested in multiple regions (Figs. 5 and 10, Table S3). The T. pedum FAD may show broadly synchronous origination at the boundary above recovery from the BACE, with a maximum radiometric age constraint of ~538.8 Ma (Linnemann et al., 2019). However, the first appearance of this ichnospecies is delayed in the Zavkhan terrane, and is not well constrained within the interval 538.8-532 Ma in Siberia, South China or the lower Cambrian boundary type section in Avalonia (Table S3). This pattern may be a consequence of local ecological, taphonomic and/or lithological controls.</p>
        <p>The FADs of Ediacaran and Cambrian shelly fossils are also highly variable temporally and spatially . The Cloudina -Namacalathus assemblage appeared ~550 Ma in the Nama Basin and became globally widespread, but asynchronously, thereafter. Anabarites trisulcatus and Protohertzina anabarica FADs, which are commonly recognized as the index fossils of the basal Cambrian strata, are in fact oldest in Siberia, where Anabarites co-occurs with Cloudina at a level below the BACE (Figs. 8-10) (Zhu et al., 2017), followed closely by the appearance of these taxa in South China (Cai et al., 2019). Cambrian-type skeletal fossils (halkieriids, chancelloriids, hyolithelminthes, hyoliths, archaeocyaths and many others) also appear highly asynchronously in different basins (Fig. 8).</p>
        <p>By contrast, our compilation suggests that the appearance of Watsonella and Aldanella at ~532-531 Ma may have had a broadly synchronous appearance during the same interval on the global δ 13 Ccarb profile, however this remains dependent upon the correlation of the ZHUCE in South China . The probability of a trilobite biomineralisation event at ~521-518 Ma is supported by the stratigraphic and paleogeographic distribution of arthropod scratch marks (e.g.</p>
        <p>Rusophycus, Cruziana and Diplichnites), which occur from ~531-525 Ma and pre-date the appearance of trilobites and other arthropods in almost every basin by several million years (Landing et al., 2020;Paterson et al., 2019). This biomineralisation event may have been driven by changing seawater chemistry (e.g. Mg/Ca ratios, pCO2), causing a shift from aragonite to calcite seas (Porter, 2007).</p>
        <p>These observations may imply two patterns of first appearance. In the first case, an animal or a group of animals appeared first in a single area and became globally widespread much later (e.g. Namibian shelly fossils including Cloudina and Namacalathus, Siberian archaeocyaths). The appearance of such organisms probably reflects local conditions most advantageous for their oxygen, calcium and other essential requirements. The second type of FADs embraces a broadly synchronous global appearance of the same group in remote regions (e.g. mollusks, trilobites). Such events can be attributed to global changes of environmental factors (e.g. pCO2, Mg:Ca ion ratio) facilitating almost simultaneous biomineralisation of hitherto soft-bodied representatives of these groups in different basins, as noted in trilobites (Paterson et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>We conclude that the Cambrian Explosion was in fact a protracted Ediacaran-Cambrian radiation. All models reveal widespread and correlatable late Ediacaran negative and positive δ 13 Ccarb excursions between ~550 Ma and the onset of the BACE. In contrast to previous studies (Amthor et al., 2003), our correlation demonstrates no significant extinction or faunal turnover coincident with the A4 anomaly, or any older negative carbon δ 13 Ccarb perturbation between 550 Ma and 540 Ma, but rather a series of successive, often regional, originations and minor extinctions. The canonical model (Model A) also implies that the disappearance of the Nama assemblage post-dated the BACE, whereas Model C may be compatible with a coincident disappearance of this assemblage with the BACE nadir. Regardless, the pre-BACE appearance of anabaritids and treptichnid traces in all models also argues against a mass extinction event coincident with the BACE.</p>
        <p>While the near synchronous global appearance of trilobites may support a calcification (biomineralisation) event in this group (Landing et al., 2020;Paterson et al., 2019), the radiation of other skeletal biota was generally highly asynchronous, with varying tempos in different basins . This may reflect both a diversity gradient formed by clade origination in low latitudinal basins (Siberia, Mongolia, Chinese and Namibian Gondwana) and then migration to higher latitudes (e.g. Avalonia, Morocco) (Fig. 11, e.g. Jablonski et al., 2006, but see Landing et al., 2020), and also a highly heterogeneous local landscape of redox and/or nutrient regimes. The origination of many skeletal groups, including cloudinids, mollusks and trilobites, as well as the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary itself, all seem to coincide with the succession of marked positive δ 13 Ccarb excursions (Figs. 9 and 10). Peak δ 13 Ccarb values during positive excursions during Cambrian stages 2-4 on the Siberian Platform have been proposed to record pulses of nutrients and oxygen into shallow marine seas that promoted biodiversification (He et al., 2019). By contrast, global δ 13 Ccarb excursions of regionally variable magnitude, from the level of the BACE to 6p, may reflect a combination of changes in glacioeustatic sea level overprinted by regional palaeomarine redox and nutrient heterogeneity. The age model framework constructed herein provides a comprehensive and editable template by which the operation of these, and other driving forces, in shaping the Ediacaran-Cambrian radiation of early animals may be explored.</p>
        <p>Sampling was undertaken at two stratigraphic sections in southern Namibia in July 2018 by FB, AC and RW. Sampled sections are located on Farms Nord Witputz (base of section 27°34'3.66"S, 16°42'12.60"E, section measured due north) and Swartpunt (base of section 27°28'21.88"S, 16°41'46.37"E) (Fig. 2). These two sections constitute carbonate-dominated members of the Urusis Formation (Schwarzrand Subgroup) that are separated by approximately 50-60 m of transgressive outer ramp to slope, green and purple shale of the Feldschuhhorn Member, and interbedded carbonate-siliciclastic units of the lower and middle Spitskop Member (e.g. Saylor, 2003;Saylor and Grotzinger, 1996;Wood et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>The Huns Member on Farm Nord Witputz overlies fossiliferous sandstone and siltstone of the Nasep Member and is composed of shallow marine limestone and subordinate dolostone. Here, strata of the Huns Member have an average dip of 20° to northwest, exposing a continuous section bounded by the conformably underlying Nasep Member to the southeast, and the conformably overlying Feldschuhhorn Member to the northwest. Packstones and ooid grainstones of the Huns Member at this locality contain occasional well-developed cross-bedding accentuated by floating grains of quartz sand indicating deposition in a high energy, shallow marine, inner to mid-ramp environment above fair weather wave base. Intervals of thinly-bedded limestone with little evidence for wave activity are interpreted as reflecting deposition in a mid-shelf environment and correspond to minor transgressive parasequences, consistent with the sequence stratigraphic model of Saylor (2003).</p>
        <p>We also compile data from a composite section noted as 'near Swartkloofberg' (Saylor et al., 1998) (Fig. 2). The 'near Swartkloofberg' section corresponds to a section incorporating the Feldschuhhorn and lower Spitskop members (medium scale sequences D11-E16 of Saylor, 2003) to the southeast of Swartpunt and the upper Spitskop Member at Swartpunt (section 14 of Saylor, 1996, position of section noted in Fig. 1 of Saylor and Grotzinger, 1996). An alternative stratigraphic correlation of the section incorporating the lower Spitskop Member would reject the lower Spitskop radiometric constraint of 542.68 ± 1.25 Ma (Grotzinger et al., 1995, recalculated in Schmitz, 2012), and directly correlate the lower Spitskop succession as an expanded shallow shelf equivalent to the Swartpunt section. This stratigraphic reassessment would significantly reduce the thickness of the Spitskop Member, constraining a maximum age for the Spitskop Member of ca. 540 Ma and repositioning the BACE/A4 to the siliciclastic Feldschuhhorn Member.</p>
        <p>It would also permit a longer duration for deposition of the underlying shale-dominated Nudaus Formation in the Witputs Sub-basin. In this alternative correlation, the downturn from positive values recorded in the Huns Member at Nord Witputz (this study) would correlate with the downturn from the A3 excursion. This alternative correlation is incorporated into Model D (Table S2).</p>
        <p>The stratigraphy, sedimentology and palaeontology of the Swartpunt section have been described in detail in previous publications (e.g. Darroch et al., 2015;Linnemann et al., 2019;Narbonne et al., 1997;Saylor, 2003;Wood et al., 2015). Sampling began 1 m above the lowermost ash layer dated at 540.095 ± 0.099 Ma (Table S1) (Linnemann et al., 2019), and continued to the summit of the koppe.</p>
        <p>The FAD of protoconodonts occurs in the lower Aksai Mb of the Chulaktau Fm (Yang et al., 2016). The Aksai Mb is an extremely condensed phosphatic unit (~5m thick). The cloudinid Rajatubulus occurs in the overlying Karatau Mb (5-10m thick unit) (Yang et al., 2016), which is entirely phosphatic. It remains possible that these phosphatic units correspond to the Zhongyicun Mb, thereby implying a post-BACE LAD of cloudinids in the Maly Karatau of Kazakhstan. Given the uncertainty in accurate age determination of these members brought on by the unsuitable (phosphatic) lithology for robust δ 13 Ccarb chemostratigraphy, we do not place undue weight on these occurrences. However, we do note in Table S3 that the Chulaktau Fm may host the global LAD of cloudinids in the lowermost Fortunian (citing Yang et al., 2016). T. pedum has not been recovered from the Chulaktau Fm of underlying units, implying that the regional FAD of this ichnospecies is most likely post-BACE in age.</p>
        <p>The FAD of anabaritids occurs in the upper Ust'-Yudoma Fm at the Kyra-Ytyga section on the Yudoma River of SE Siberia (Zhu et al., 2017). In this section, anabaritids co-occur with cloudinids during a positive δ 13 Ccarb plateau and below a downturn that is inferred to be the BACE onset. Anabaritids also occur in a pre-BACE position in the lower Turkut Fm of the Khorbusuonka River of NE Siberia (Rogov et al., 2015;Knoll et al., 1995;Pelechaty et al., 1996). The LAD of cloudinids is also within this pre-BACE interval throughout sections of the Siberian Platform. The FAD of T. pedum occurs in the upper Syhargalakh Fm along the Khorbusuonka River of the Olenek Uplift. The Syhargalakh Fm is a condensed siliciclastic unit, and the T. pedum FAD occurs above a poorly calibrated maximum age derived from air-abrasion ID-TIMS U-Pb dating of the Tas-Yuryakh volcanic breccia (Bowring et al., 1993) (Table S1). The T. pedum FAD in this section occurs beneath carbonates of the Mattaia Fm that host Aldanella and a CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb age of ~529.70 Ma (Kaufman et al., 2012;Grazhdankin et al., 2019). In sections of the SW Siberian Platform, T. pedum occurs within a bed with a maximum detrital zircon age of 531.1 ± 5.20 Ma (weighted mean 530.6 ± 5.30 Ma) in the Irkut Formation (Marusin et al., 2020, their Fig. 4e).</p>
        <p>However, this trace fossil does not display a clear regular probing pattern typical of T. pedum and can be rather interpreted as a treptichnid s.l. The FAD of T. pedum across the Siberian Platform therefore remains poorly constrained but most likely above the nadir of the BACE.</p>
        <p>Spain: According to Álvaro et al. (2019), the lowest occurrence of T. pedum is within the lower Arrocampo Fm of the Ibor and Navalpino anticlines, below a regional unconformity. The LAD of in situ Cloudina is noted from the underlying Villarta Fm in the same succession. Allochthonous broken fragments of reworked Cloudina are noted from megabreccia blocks in the neighbouring Valdelacasa anticline. Given the absence of a robust δ 13 Ccarb framework and the complexity of the fragmentary record, it is not possible to assign the Valdelacasa cloudinids to the lower Cambrian.</p>
        <p>The Tamengo Fm hosts cloudinids from an interval with positive δ 13 Ccarb (Boggiani et al., 2010). High precision radiometric dating constrains this interval as Ediacaran (&gt;541 Ma) (Parry et al., 2017). Unfortunately, the succession transitions to siliciclastics of the Guaicurus Fm, and the age of this transition is poorly constrained in time pre-BACE.</p>
        <p>Paraguay: Cloudinids and other Ediacaran skeletal fossils in Paraguay occur in a positive δ 13 Ccarb plateau as demonstrated in numerous publications (e.g. Warren et al., 2019Warren et al., , 2017Warren et al., , 2011)). These δ 13 Ccarb records, and an associated U-Pb SHRIMP age of 545 ± 4.5 Ma (Warren et al., 2019), correlate most readily with the late Ediacaran δ 13 Ccarb record. We are not familiar with any published reports that show T. pedum co-occurring with Cloudina in sections of the Itapucumi Group, and to our knowledge, the FAD of T. pedum is therefore most likely higher in the succession, in accordance with the global record.</p>
        <p>Carefully selected micritic carbonate was microdrilled from hand samples and simultaneously analysed for δ 13 Ccarb and δ 18 Ocarb on an Elementar PRECISION stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer following reaction with 100% orthophosphoric acid at 75°C, using an Elementar iso FLOW system at the Wolfson Laboratory, School of Geosciences, Grant Institute, University of Edinburgh. New δ 13 Ccarb data from the upper Nama Group are reported in per mil (‰) notation relative to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard (VPDB) alongside compiled global δ 13 Ccarb data for the interval ca. 551-517 Ma in Table S2 (Supplementary xlsx file). The standard deviation for replicate analyses (n=7) of an in-house coral standard (Reference COR1D) measured alongside samples (standard-sample bracketing) was better than ±0.02‰ for δ 13 Ccarb and ±0.08‰ for δ 18 Ocarb.</p>
        <p>The long mean residence time of Sr (3-5 Myrs) relative to the mixing time of the global ocean (~1500 yrs) results in a globally homogeneous seawater Sr isotopic composition (Elderfield, 1986). Long term changes in oceanic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr reflect the balance between radiogenic (high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) input derived from continental weathering versus non-radiogenic (low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) input from hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust (Brass, 1976). Unlike the majority of Phanerozoic studies that benefit from targeted analyses of Sr retained with high fidelity in carbonate biominerals, strontium isotope stratigraphy in pre-Cambrian and lower Cambrian sections relies upon identifying primary marine Sr isotopic compositions from bulk (often micritic) carbonate (e.g. Halverson et al., 2007). Post-depositional diagenetic exchange and contamination of bulk carbonate by silicate-bound phases commonly result in deviation towards more radiogenic values (Veizer and Compston, 1976), however late diagenesis may also skew 87 Sr/ 86 Sr to lower values resulting 87 Sr/ 86 Sr correlation, are provided in the supplementary information. All data were normalized to NIST SRM987 = 0.710250. The resulting compilation, including data that did not pass our screening procedure, is provided in Table S2, and shown graphically by lithology and [Sr] in Figure 4. We consider the lowest values throughout the studied interval to best represent seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, with the exception of the values reported from the Mastakh and Khatyspyt formations (red boxes in Fig 4c,g, see Supplementary Information).</p>
        <p>Our screening procedure removed ~50% of the data compiled from the published literature, most of which tended towards radiogenic values. The remaining 87 Sr/ 86 Sr dataset (Fig 4 ) shows significant variability, likely due to the effects of diagenesis or contamination that are indecipherable using only the published geochemical information. We consider the lowest values throughout the studied interval to best represent seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, with the exception of the values reported from the Mastakh and Khatyspyt formations (red boxes in Fig. 4c and4g, see below).</p>
        <p>Low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are commonly retained in high [Sr] (&gt;500ppm) limestone and dolomite samples, whereas samples with low [Sr] tend to deviate towards more radiogenic values, consistent with the findings of Halverson et al. (2007). However, of the 208 samples that were removed by the final screening criteria (Mn/Sr &gt; 1, [Rb] &gt; 1ppm), 25 closely follow the trend captured by the 'most reliable' data, which attests to the complications inherent in assigning cut-off thresholds for sample screening of legacy datasets. The resulting seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr curves (grey lines in Fig. 4) show trends consistent with previous correlations (e.g. Halverson et al., 2007;Maloof et al., 2010), whereby latest Ediacaran to Fortunian values remain relatively constant in the range 0.70840 -0.70850 before beginning to decrease in lower Cambrian Stage 2 and reaching a nadir of ~0.70806 at the boundary between stages 2 and 3, followed by increasing values during Stage 3.</p>

We anticipate substantial modification to this age after future reanalysis. If taken as a minimum age for the top of the Turkut Formation, this may imply correlation of the negative excursion at the top of the Turkut Formation (e.g. at the Olenek River section) with the either the A0 excursion, or the more minor negative excursion in the lowermost part of the upper Dengying Fm (Beiwan and equivalent members). We prefer to correlate the Turkut negative excursion with the A4 onset, which is also (Bowring et al., 1993) consistent with the interpretation of Maloof et al.

        <p>Tables S1,S3 Other Supplementary Materials for this manuscript include the following: Reviewing the co-occurrence of Cloudina, Namacalathus and T. pedum According to published information, T. pedum and Cloudina sensu stricto do not occur at the same level, and the T. pedum FAD occurs after the BACE nadir. We review these occurrences briefly below: Nama Group, southern Namibia: The published LAD of cloudinids and Namacalathus occurs in the uppermost beds of the Swartpunt section, dated by CA-ID-TIMS to between ~539.6 Ma and ~538.6 Ma. There is no evidence from δ 13 Ccarb for the BACE at Swartpunt, and this interval is therefore most parsimoniously interpreted to be immediately pre-BACE (Model C). Though simple ichnofossils, including treptichnids, appear lower in the Nama succession, the FAD of T. pedum occurs in siliciclastic valley fill deposits on farms Vergelee and Sonntagsbrunn, &gt;100km to the east of farms Swartpunt and Swartkloofberg (Wilson et al., 2012;Darroch et al., 2021). The maximum age for the T. pedum FAD is currently very loosely constrained by inferred lateral equivalence between the Swartkloofberg section (basal Nomtsas maximum age of ~538. 6 Ma, Linnemann et al., 2019) and the valley fill deposits on farms Vergelee and Sonntagsbrunn.</p>
        <p>However, it has been noted that the tuff bed from the Nomtsas Fm at Swartkloofberg may be reworked (Linnemann et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>South China (please see Figs. S3 andS4): Both Cloudina and tubicolous calcifiers of 'Cambrian'type are at inferred-pre-BACE levels in the Lijiagou section of the shallow Yangtze Platform (see Figs. S2 and S3, Cai et al., 2019). This is the lowest published occurrence of Cambrian-type small skeletal fossils (SSFs) in South China, however accurate correlation of the δ 13 Ccarb profile in this section remains problematic. In South China, the FAD of T. pedum occurs in the phosphatic Zhongyicun Mb of the Zhujiqing Fm in multiple sections of the shallow platform. The underlying (Daibu) Member and correlative units across the Yangtze Platform host the BACE nadir. (Brand et al., 2010). Furthermore, identifying the most robust estimates of seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr from legacy datasets is often hampered by the limited geochemical information necessary for adequate screening, and the lack of a standardized methodology for chemical pre-treatment and dissolution over the past 30 years of Sr isotope research.</p>
        <p>Due to the specific complications noted above, in addition to sample-specific carbonate mineralogy and differential diagenesis, a universal screening procedure to determine primary seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr from bulk carbonate data has proven elusive. A number of criteria are classically used to identify the most isotopically altered samples, including Mn/Sr, Mg/Ca, δ 18 O and 87 Rb/ 86 Sr. However, applying cut-off values for these parameters to determine degrees of diagenetic alteration is often an unsuitable oversimplification, especially in the case of Mn/Sr, where some primary marine carbonates may have precipitated from manganous seawater (e.g. Halverson et al., 2007).</p>
        <p>We compiled an updated dataset of published 87 Sr/ 86 Sr from stratigraphic sections covering the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition interval (Table S2), and employed a liberal screening procedure using available geochemical data in an attempt to filter out values considered least likely to represent seawater composition. Samples with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr &gt; 0.7095 and &gt;20% insoluble residue (where this information is available) were automatically discounted, and the remaining data were screened on a section by section basis in order to identify trends suggestive of diagenetic alteration, including cross-plotting 87 Sr/ 86 Sr against Mn/Sr, [Sr], [Rb], and δ 18 O. In most cases, clear covariations between these parameters was not observed, with the exception of [Sr] (see Supplementary Information for details). We then discounted all data with Mn/Sr &gt; 1 and [Rb] &gt; 1ppm, as a final test.
