        <p>Lake Urmia, located in the northwestern of Iran, was once the most extensive permanent hypersaline lake in the world. It has been shrinking at an alarming rate during the last two decades. Unsustainable water management in response to increasing demand together with climatic extremes have given rise to the lake's depletion. Based on research findings, short-and long-term approaches have been proposed to revive the lake.

        <p>Lake Urmia, once the largest permanent hypersaline lake in the world, has been shrinking at an alarming rate during the last two decades (Wurtsbaugh et al., 2017;UNEP, 2012). The lake water level and its area have decreased at a rate of 34 cm/yr and 220 km 2 /yr, respectively (Tourian et al., 2015). Unsustainable water management in collaboration with increasing demand and climatic extremes have given rise to the observed depletion of the lake (Schulz et al., 2020;AghaKouchak, 2015;Arkian et al., 2018;Ghale et al., 2018;Chaudhari et al., 2018;Shadkam et al., 2016). Precipitation and water inflow from different rivers are the main sources of water into the lake. Precipitation has decreased moderately between -9 mm/year and -20 mm/year while the air temperature of the region has risen significantly between 0.15 • C/year and 0.2 • C/year (Arkian et al., 2018;Nourani et al., 2018;Delju et al., 2013;Fathian et al., 2015). The decrease in rainfall after 1995 played an important role in the documented decline of the lake water level (Arkian et al., 2018). Moreover, the increase in temperature, accompanied by a rise in sunshine duration, has accelerated the rate of evaporation over the lake which is the only direct sink (Nourani et al., 2018).Lake Urmia, once the largest permanent hypersaline lake in the world, has been shrinking at an alarming rate during the last two decades (Wurtsbaugh et al., 2017;UNEP, 2012).

        <p>Many studies have identified various anthropogenic factors responsible for the lake's shrinkage. In particular, the expansion of irrigated land areas and, in consequence, increased water demand for agricultural purposes is one of the main drivers (Shadkam et al., 2016;Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2016;Ghale et al., 2017;Chaudhari et al., 2018;Khazaei et al., 2018). Moreover, irrigation systems in the catchment often have low efficiency which accounts for significant amount of water loss in the agricultural sector (Dariane &amp; Eamen, 2017). Flow regulation through the construction of dams has decreased the inflow to the lake indirectly by accelerating the irrigation expansion (Shadkam et al., 2016;Hassanzadeh et al., 2012). During two major drought periods, 1997-1998 and 2007-2008, agriculture practices put stress on groundwater resources of the basin by over-extracting water from wells. Tourian et al. (2015) demonstrated that groundwater depletion was alarming between 2003 and 2014, in which the total water storage over the catchment decreased at a rate of about -26.9±18 mm/yr. Similar trend values have been reported by other studies (Voss et al., 2013; above employed different approaches to investigate the main reasons behind the desiccation of the lake, they all found that human intervention was a more significant factor than climate change.Many studies have identified various anthropogenic factors responsible for the lake's shrinkage.

        <p>The desiccation of Lake Urmia has threatened the local population's health and economy and raised national and international concern. Based on research findings, short and long-term approaches have been proposed to revive the lake from what was called the water bankruptcy (Madani et al., 2016). Revising the surface water management, improving the efficiency of the irrigation systems, introducing a water market, increasing public awareness to conserve water and averting new dam construction are the main strategies that have been advocated (Hassanzadeh et al., 2012;Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2016;Dariane &amp; Eamen, 2017;Shadkam et al., 2016;Ghale et al., 2018). The government of Iran established the Urmia Lake Restoration Program, ulrp, a ten-year program (2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017)(2018)(2019)(2020)(2021)(2022)(2023) to revive Lake Urmia in three phases: i) stabilizing the current status; ii) restoration; and iii) sustaining the restoration. The ulrp aims to achieve its objectives by reducing the amount of water required for irrigation within a five-year program. Meanwhile, it plans to boost the water productivity up to 60 % using advanced irrigation systems. Moreover, it is intended to divert water from the Zab and Silveh rivers to the Urmia Lake basin. Finally, the ulrp has planned to use treated waste-water as a source of inflow to the lake.The desiccation of Lake Urmia has threatened the local population's health and economy and raised national and international concern.

        <p>In the recent past, only a few studies have assessed the progress of the restoration program. Sima et al. (2020) concluded that the ecological water level should be set to a higher level to reduce salinity for recovering brine shrimp and flamingos. Moreover, they suggested defining a range of water level instead of a single ecological level to include more ecosystem services. Danesh-Yazdi &amp; Ataie-Ashtiani ( 2019) assessed the status of the lake by analyzing its water level over the past six years. They claimed that the current restoration plan needs to be revisited and they highlighted the importance of data for a more realistic model and plan.In the recent past, only a few studies have assessed the progress of the restoration program.

        <p>In this study, we aim to monitor and analyze the restoration progress of the Lake Urmia using mainly the observations from satellites accompany with ground-based measurements. Furthermore, we discuss the cause of the variation in the status of the lake using hydrological parameters over the lake and its closed basin, including fluxes namely precipitation and evaporation. We present the time series of total water storage (tws) change of the Urmia basin from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (grace) mission added with its successor GRACE Follow-On for the first time. The ground-based data available for the Urmia basin and the lake includes in situ data of the inflow to the lake, and in situ groundwater data both for validation and analyses. Using the data mentioned above, we have investigated the role of climate factors and human activities, including the ulrp in the region, specifically after 2013.In this study, we aim to monitor and analyze the restoration progress of the Lake Urmia using mainly the observations from satellites accompany with ground-based measurements.

        <p>Lake Urmia, located in northwestern Iran, is one of the world's largest permanent hypersaline lakes and the largest in the Middle East (Figure 1). About 5 springs, bring water into the lake. The majority (about 75 %) of the water inflow to the lake comes from river discharge while surface water runoff, groundwater resources, and precipitation provide about 25 % of the water inflow (Eimanifar &amp; Mohebbi, 2007;Zarghami, 2011). Around 41 reservoirs have been constructed over rivers inside the basin since 1970 with the capacity of storing 2 • 10 9 m 3 of water. The surface area of the lake has varied between 1000 and 6000 km 2 during the last two decades (Tourian et al., 2015;Zarghami, 2011). A 1709 m causeway called Shahid Kalantari divided the lake into a northern and a southern part in 2008. Water exchanges between these two part via a culvert along the causeway. Lake Urmia is located in a closed basin with a catchment area of about 52 000 km 2 . In terms of topography, the basin is surrounded by mountains (about 65 % of the catchment area) with vast agriculturally productive plains (about 21 % of the catchment area) located in the middle of the basin and around the lake. The lake and its surrounding area account for nearly 14 % of the total area of the catchment. The altitude of the basin varies between 1280 m and 4886 m above sea level. The basin climate is classified as arid to semi-arid where agriculture depends vitally on irrigation. Based on data from 1973 to 2011, the average annual precipitation over the basin is 352 mm (Farajzadeh et al., 2014). The air temperature of the basin usually varies from 0 to -20 • C during the winter period and increases up to 40 • C in a hot summer (Eimanifar &amp; Mohebbi, 2007).Lake Urmia, located in northwestern Iran, is one of the world's largest permanent hypersaline lakes and the largest in the Middle East (Figure 1).

        <p>The Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ulrp) was established in October 2013. It consists of 6 technical committees and 20 working teams that aim to implement integrated approaches for catchment management and to provide solutions to restore the Urmia Lake (ULRP, 2015b). ulrp has defined its main mission as Urmia Lake Restoration and aims to increase the lake water level to reach a so-called ecological equilibrium till 2023. The corresponding ecological water level, 1274.67 m above sea level, was established based on water quality conditions (240 g l -1 of NaCl) needed to retain brine shrimp Artemia (Abbaspour &amp; Nazaridoust, 2007). Three main visions have been announced by ulrp including the life cycle revival of the lake (the most important), integrated water resource management of its basin, and sustainable agricultural development. Moreover, the minimum water level of 1271.72 m, so called health threshold, is crucial to minimize the health risk from dust-prone regions of the lake (Sima et al., 2020;Mardi et al., 2018). This new criterion will assure that more than 90 % of the dust producing areas will be covered with water (RSRC, 2016).The Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ulrp) was established in October 2013.

However, in many countries like Iran, recent measurements are not provided publicly. As a result, in this study, we evaluate the performance of 10 gridded precipitation datasets over the Urmia basin compared with a gridded in-situ data from 255 stations. Finally, we selected six bias-corrected datasets and used them for monitoring and assessments. The process of computing gridded precipitation from point measurements and then evaluating the datasets are discussed in detail in Ap-pendixA.Precipitation: Observation from a dense network of rain-gauges provides the best estimation of precipitation over a region.

The degree-1 coefficients were added to the grace fields, as suggested by Swenson et al. (2007). Since the grace fields are noisy, we use a Gaussian filter of half-width radius 400 km to filter them (Devaraju, 2015). Then we compute the regional average of total water storage change over the Urmia basin for each month to obtain a time-series. This time-series is not an accurate representation of the hydrological changes because filtering damages the signal via leakage and attenuation (Vishwakarma et al., 2016).

In Figure 11 we have plotted the time-series from filtered grace fields and the corrected time-series.</p>
        <p>To obtain a holistic assessment of the current status of the lake, we present the results and discussions in three parts. First, we investigate the recent water change of the lake by monitoring and analysing the water level, surface area, and volume of the lake. In the second part, we study the water balance in Lake Urmia as an independent system (see figure 2a). In this part, we assess the time series of precipitation and lake inflow as the sources and evaporation as the only sink. Finally, we investigate changes in the main parameters of the basin, including the water balance fluxes (see figure 2b). Although the lake water level decreased by an average of 14 cm and 17 cm cm in 2017 and 2018, respectively, it still was in a better situation than 2015, on average 16 cm and 12.5 cm higher, respectively. In 2019, the lake experienced its highest water level over the past decade. In the first seven months of the year, the average water level of the lake was more than 74 cm higher than in 2015, with the average monthly variation this year found to be similar to 2010. The lake experienced a positive trend of 14.5 cm/year from 2015 to 2019.To obtain a holistic assessment of the current status of the lake, we present the results and discussions in three parts.

        <p>From 2015 to the end of 2018, a trend in the lake area is negligible although a large annual amplitude exists. The lake experienced a jump and reached 2922 km 2 in June 2016. The average area of the lake was 1489 km 2 and 1246 km 2 In order to obtain a better understanding of the lake area variations during the monitoring period, water coverage frequency maps of Lake Urmia for specific periods are presented in figure 5. high slope of the lake bed will led to large changes in the surface water area against slight changes in the lake water level. In this way, yellow dots represent the deepest slope in the lake bed and green dots indicate the mildest slope. The scatter plot delineates the shrinking process of the lake with a weak negative trend in green dots, strong negative trend in yellow and red dots, and positive trend in orange dots.

        <p>To investigate the changes in the lake over the last six years in more detail, we analyze the scatter plot of area versus the in-situ water level of the lake between 2014 to 2019 (shown in Figure 5b). The colors follow Figure 3 (bottom). The year 2014 is included as a reference for tracking the process of desiccation.

        <p>The evaporation from the lake shows weak positive trend of 0.02 km 3 /year and precipitation to the lake 0.10 km 3 /year.

        <p>where S is the water volume of the lake, one can conclude that the main cause of the increase in water volume of the lake comes from the change in the inflow from rivers. We monitored the ratio of inflow to the total precipitation of the Urmia basin over the last 25 years back to 1995 when the lake had its highest area. The precipitation shows a positive trend from 1995 to 2019, ignoring the inter-annual fluctuations of precipitation to the basin. Although the basin gained more water in the 2000s and 2010s, the inflow from rivers declined. This decline is correlated with the decrease in the water volume of the lake and acknowledged in the previous studies like (Danesh-Yazdi &amp; Ataie-Ashtiani, 2019; Schulz et al., 2020). From 2015, with initiating the restoration endeavours in the basin, the lake gained more water from rivers and reservoirs as the inflow which is highly correlated with the rise in the water volume of the lake.where S is the water volume of the lake, one can conclude that the main cause of the increase in water volume of the lake comes from the change in the inflow from rivers.

        <p>Lake Urmia lies at the lowest point in a closed drainage basin. Natural and anthropogenic activities inside the basin affect the state of the lake. Therefore, we monitored the water balance fluxes, namely precipitation and evapotran-spiration, in section 5.3. Water balance fluxes consider surface water change and are blind to the deep groundwater change. Hence we employed grace to monitor total water storage change inside the catchment (see section 5.3).Lake Urmia lies at the lowest point in a closed drainage basin.

        <p>In this section, we investigate the change in the components of the water balance of the Urmia basin, namely precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the total water storage anomaly. These parameters have been surveyed to understand the reasons behind the desiccation of the lake (Arkian et al., 2018;Ghale et al., 2018;Shadkam et al., 2016;Tourian et al., 2015). Precipitation represents more natural variation in the climate, while anthropogenic activities like agriculture can influence evapotranspiration. Finally, satellite gravimetry provides a holistic view of storage change in the basin, including variation in deep water. Expansion of irrigated area is reported as a primary cause of the lake's desiccation (Khazaei et al., 2018;Schulz et al., 2020). However, monitoring and analysing the spatio-temporal change of the agricultural land area needs groundbased observations for calibration and validation. Since such an observation is not available for the restoration period, we have not included an assessment of irrigated area into our analyses. in-situ water level mean annual water level For further validation, we assess the agreement between P -ET and grace in the water balance equation:In this section, we investigate the change in the components of the water balance of the Urmia basin, namely precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the total water storage anomaly.

To be more precise, except for 2017 (two months with moderate drought) and 2016 (moderately wet), all years were conform with the long-term climatology of the catchment. However, the catchment received massive water from heavy rainfall in spring 2019. Experiencing such a drought-free period from 2015 to 2019 significantly helped stopping the shrinkage of the lake and push it into the restoration phase.• The time series of precipitation does not show any significant trend between 2015-2018.

        <p>• The stabilization seems to be fragile however, since most of the increase in water volume of the lake has spread over the large shallow region in the south with high evaporation potential during hot seasons.

        <p>The results of this study are in line with studies in recent years, which generally analyzed Lake Urmia's desiccation (Hosseini-Moghari et al., 2018;Khazaei et al., 2018;Chaudhari et al., 2018;Ghale et al., 2018). In order to achieve a sustainable restoration, more tenable efforts are required, such as those suggested in previous studies including preventing diversion of water flows into the lake towards agricultural land. Our result showed that the Lake Urmia had been stabilized as the result of a largely positive trend in the inflow to the lake, mainly due to the heavy rainfall in 2019. Since the elevation of Lake Urmia in the southern part is associated with shallow water depths, the process of lake restoration might not be sustainable and is feared to be reversed by drought in the coming years. we selected the datasets with (omfe) less than 5 % of the long-term average of the annual precipitation over the Lake Urmia basin (c.f. green box in figureThe results of this study are in line with studies in recent years, which generally analyzed Lake Urmia's desiccation (Hosseini-Moghari et al., 2018;Khazaei et al., 2018;Chaudhari et al., 2018;Ghale et al., 2018).

        <p>We assessed the gridded precipitation datasets over the Urmia basin using the ground-based data. Among all datasets, we have selected those that had data after 2014 until 2019 (see table ). Ground-based data for precipitation were not available after 2014. The in-situ data is collected through synoptic stations and rain-gauges of the Ministry of Energy, more than 257 rain-gauge daily time series in Iran throughout 1965-2013 (Figure 1). Before comparison, we controlled the quality and homogenized the precipitation time series according to Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010). We used a grid of a half degree over Urmia basin same as global gridded precipitation datasets. To reach a gridded data from in-situ at each month, we averaged the precipitation from stations at each grid. Finally, we obtained the monthly precipitation over the Urmia basin by aggregating gridded datasets and gridded in-situ. we compared the in situ time series with the time series of the datasets (table AppendixA), using a Taylor diagram (Taylor, 2001), (cf. Figure A.13), which shows three types of statistics: the correlation coefficient, the Root Mean Square Difference (rmsd), and the standard deviation. Almost all global datasets show a fairly strong linear correlation with the ground-based data with a correlation coefficient of more than 0.75. Since metrics summarized the comparison in one value and does not give us the whole picture of errors. Therefore, we compared the Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf) of the over median folded error (omfe) of all datasets over the period of 1983-2013 (see figure A.12). Finally, modis (250 m). It is important to mention that the bathymetry of the lake is not constant during the study period, mainly due to the sediment of salt to the bed of the lake.
