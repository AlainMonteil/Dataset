        <p>• Key feature: attenuation mode of the local resonance mass couples with the inertially amplified resonance leading to coupled double peaks in the attenuation profile</p>

        <p>The generation of frequency band gaps (stop bands) within which waves spatially attenuate is one of the coveted characteristics of periodic structures [1][2][3]. This concept has attracted research from a variety of disciplines, including vibrations, structural dynamics, acoustics, and materials physics. In an attenuation band, a free or driven wave cannot</p>

Hussein) propagate, and instead experiences exponential attenuation along the direction of propagation. The most common band-gap formation mechanism is based on wave interferences and Bragg scattering. Destructive interferences of transmitted and reflected waves from periodic inclusions, interfaces, and/or boundaries within the medium is the main cause behind Bragg scattering [4,5]. Band gaps may also emerge due to local resonances; these may be realized in an elastic or acoustic waveguide with intrinsically embedded or attached resonators (usually distributed periodically) [6,7]. The key mechanism for locally resonance band gaps is a coupling-a hybridization-between substructure resonance modes and elastic wave modes in the hosting medium.</p>
        <p>Given the practical benefits of band gaps, it is often desirable to find unit-cell configurations that exhibit band gaps that are both as low and wide as possible in the frequency domain; see, for example, Refs. [8][9][10][11][12] for Bragg band gaps and Refs. [13][14][15] for localresonance band gaps. Band-gap enlargement by possibly utilizing more than one band-gap mechanism in a combined manner has also been pursued [16,17]. Relatively wide Bragg band gaps may be realized by careful unit-cell topology design and optimization [8][9][10]; however, the unit cell is fundamentally constrained to be on the order of the wavelength of the interfering waves. This, in turn, implies relatively high-frequency band gaps for small unit cells. On the other hand, while local resonances provide an effective path towards realizing low-frequency, subwavelength band gaps with small unit cells (since resonance couplings are independent of wave interferences), these tend to be overly narrow and require a relatively heavy resonator to drop significantly in the frequency domain [18]. To address these limitations, the mechanism of inertial amplification has been introduced as an alternative for band-gap generation in structured media [19][20][21]. Inertial amplification represents a contrast to local resonance in a subtle manner because it involves a mechanical mechanism to provide a magnification of the "effective inertia" of a resonator. This concept has been realized by the introduction of a lever-arm effect whereby the inertia of a resonating mass is magnified to a degree proportional to the arm length. A unique feature that emerges in certain implementations is the existence of a double-peak in the attenuation profile which is represented in the imaginary part of the dispersion diagram [22]. Compared to a single peak-which is realized in an IA chain with only one independent degree of freedom in the unit cell [23]-double peaks provide a frequency range with a significantly higher spatial attenuation strength. These traits bring rise to band gaps that can be both low, wide, and highly attenuating-all while keeping the unit cell size within the subwavelength regime. Upon reduction to its canonical form, inertial amplification is realized by introducing a classical inerter element into a locally resonant mass-in-mass chain [24], as demonstrated by Kulkarni and Manimala [25] and Al Babaa et al. [26].</p>
        <p>Since its introduction in 2007 by Yilmaz et al., the concept of inertial amplification in phononic media has been attracting increasing attention among the phononics community; see, e.g., Refs. [22,[27][28][29][30][31].</p>
        <p>In previous studies of inertially amplified (IA) phononic materials/structures, the double peaks in the attenuation spectrum stem from a direct connection between an IA mass (which exhibits an antiresonance) and an independent degree of freedom associated with another component in the system causing the generation a second antiresonance (possibly due to a local resonance effect). 1 This enables combined frequency breadth and spatial attenuation strength for the band gap, whereas the location of the IA antiresonance is determined by the level of amplification-which in turn is controlled by levering the acceleration of the IA mass using a rigid, or rigid-like, link. These features create an IA mechanism that either define the backbone configuration of a phononic waveguide [19][20][21] or serve as an attachment to a standard continuous elastic structure such as a rod [22] or a beam [28]. In the latter cases, the IA modal mass is coupled to a modal degree of freedom representing the motion of the supporting continuous base. In contrast, in this paper we present a mechanism whereby the generation of the double-peak attenuation band gap is obtained from a modal coupling of an IA mass and a locally resonant mass separately attached to the base waveguide. This intrinsic and coupled mixing of the motion of an IA mass and that of a conventional attached local resonator to open up a wide subwavelength band gap with two peaks in the imaginary wavenumber domain represents a novel concept with significant implications on band-gap design. We present a lumped-parameter model realising this concept, and derive the corresponding complex dispersion relation. An analytical expression is also provided that characterizes the coupling conditions. A parametric analysis is then carried out to identify the sensitivity of the governing parameters on the attenuation properties. Three metrics are proposed for quantifying the performance of this type of band gap. The behavior of these performance metrics with variation in the governing design parameters are then examined to pave the way for realization of optimized configurations. Effective mass and stiffness properties are also calculated to add further insight. Finally, we present at the end of our investigation a direct comparison-on both infinite and finite chains-between the response when the resonator mass is included versus when it is removed.</p>
        <p>Our proposed inertially amplified chain is depicted in Fig. 1(a). Two successive baseline masses M are connected to each other with a baseline spring K and a pair of inertial amplifiers each of mass m a . Each inertial amplifier mass is levered with rigid links as illustrated in Fig. 1. These inertial amplifier masses play the key role in inducing inertial amplification, as their accelerations are amplified owing to the lever-arm formed by the connecting mechanism. To introduce a "tuning knob" for the level of inertial amplification, a vertical spring with stiffness k a , termed the vertical stiffness of the inertial amplifier, is introduced as shown in Fig. 1(b). When the value of k a is set to zero, maximum inertial amplification is attained. As it is increased, the level of inertial amplification decreases representing an effective loss of rigidity in the connecting link. In the limit of high vertical stiffness, the levered masses transition their behaviour to standard local resonance (see analysis in the following section).</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, a spring-mass linear resonator is attached to the base chain. The modal degree of freedom associated with the linear spring-mass resonator may be tuned to couple with that associated with the inertially amplified mass and thus creating a band gap with a double-attenuation peak in the imaginary part of the dispersion diagram; this aspect is discussed and analysed in the next sections. First we will examine the effective mass stemming from this unique configuration. The equation of motion of the resonating mass can be written as</p>
        <p>where u n and w x denote the displacement of the baseline mass and local resonator mass, respectively, ω is the free wave frequency, ω 2 s = K/M is the natural frequency of the base chain mass/spring, ω 2 r = k/m is the natural frequency of the local resonator mass/spring, Ω is a non-dimensional frequency ratio defined as Ω = ω/ω s , and η r is a non-dimensional frequency ratio which can be written as η r = ω r /ω s .</p>
        <p>The frequency dependent effective baseline mass M e can be computed from the momentum balance as follows:</p>
        <p>where θ r = m/M is defined as a dimensionless parameter.</p>
        <p>From the system kinematics, the relationship between the acceleration of the auxiliary masses vn and the acceleration of the main mass ün and ün-1 can be expressed as</p>
        <p>where α is the angle of the rigid-link with the axial axis of the base chain, as shown in Fig. 1. The force on the rigid links can be calculated by balancing the forces acting at the mass of the inertial amplifier as</p>
        <p>The force component acting from the inertial amplifier on the baseline mass in the direction of the wave propagation is</p>
        <p>The governing equation of motion for the n th baseline mass in the chain is as follows:</p>
        <p>where M e and K e are the effective baseline mass and stiffness of the overall chain as shown in Fig 1 . The effective stiffness K e can be expressed as K + χ where χ is defined as shown in Eq. 5. From Bloch's theorem, the displacement of the successive units can be written as:</p>
        <p>where a is the length of the unit cell, q is the wavenumber, and a dimensionless term qa is represented by µ. Substituting Eq. 7 into Eq. 6, we derive the dispersion relationship as</p>
        <p>The effective stiffness K e , in turn, reads as</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>is the inertial amplification factor; it is a parameter that represents the ratio of the inertial amplifier mass m a to the baseline mass M considering the influence of the angle of the inertial amplifier α. The parameter θ = m a /M is the ratio of the inertial amplifier mass to the baseline mass.</p>
        <p>• η a = ω a /ω s is the ratio of the inertial amplifier/vertical spring natural frequency ω a = k a /m a to the base chain mass/spring natural frequency ω s = K/M .</p>
        <p>• θ r = m/M is the ratio of the resonator mass to the base chain mass.</p>
        <p>• η r = ω r /ω s is the local resonator frequency ratio, defined as the ratio of the local resonance mass/spring natural frequency ω r = k/m to the base chain mass/spring natural frequency ω s = K/M .</p>
        <p>A propagation band may be identified from the range of cos µ of Eq. 8; this is because a real µ corresponds to a propagating wave:</p>
        <p>It can be seen that Eq. 10 depends only on four non-dimensional parameters: β, η a , η r and θ r . For η a = 0, the inequality of Eq. 10 can be further simplified as follows:</p>
        <p>Propagating waves:</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>indirectly predict the locations of the band-gap edges as a function of the model design parameters.</p>
        <p>Equation 2 and Eq. 9 define the frequency-dependent dynamical effective mass and stiffness needed to obtain identical dispersive behavior. The effective mass ratio M is the ratio of the effective mass M e to the baseline mass M , and the effective stiffness ratio K is the ratio of the effective stiffness K e to the baseline stiffness K. These are expressed, respectively, as follows:</p>
        <p>In principle, a one-to-one mapping can be realized between the complex dispersion relation and these frequency-dependent effective properties. These quantities will be used in the upcoming subsection in the analysis of the attenuation mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Two attenuation peaks are noticed when the effective stiffness is equal to zero, i.e., K = 0 and the effective mass tends to infinite, i.e., M e → ∞. From Eq. 12, it can be seen that the stiffness peak Ω s occurs at Ω s = 1/β while η a = 0 and the mass peak occurs at Ω m = η r . Additionally, the above condition occurs while a transition of the band-gap character occurs at βη 2 r (1 + θ r ) = 1.</p>
        <p>In conjunction to Bloch wave propagation analysis of infinite models, it is useful to also examine the response of corresponding finite models. This provides insights into how the wave attenuation characteristics displayed in the imaginary wave number of the dispersion diagrams manifest in a truncated finite system subject to some form of excitation.</p>
        <p>Implementing the "backward substitution based" method [15] and "momentum balance" technique [32] for a full finite chain, the transmittance and effective mass can be computed by the following approach. The displacement amplitude of the last unit cell in the finite chain is written as:</p>
        <p>whereas, the displacement amplitude of the j th unit cell is expressed as:</p>
        <p>Solving Eq. 14 for the n -1 and proceeding backwards to the second unit cell, we obtain the amplitude of displacement u 1 in terms of u n . Thus, the transmittance can be easily expressed as τ = log 10</p>
        <p>un . The effective mass, on the other hard, can be computed as:</p>
        <p>In this section, we evaluate the dispersion relations derived and present their behaviour as a function of the model parameters with a focus on the influence on the attenuation profile in the imaginary part of the band structure diagram.</p>
        <p>We start by examining the variation of the inertial amplification factor β, which as described earlier is a function of the ratio θ of inertial amplifier mass m a to baseline mass M and the rigid-link angle α. This parameter provides a direct representation of the level of effective inertial amplification of the levered mass-which in the static state is First, we consider a case with only the inertial amplifier and no local resonator attached to the baseline mass; this configuration has been examined in Ref. [19]. This case is obtained by setting θ r = 0. Therefore, Eq. 10 can be simplified further to</p>
        <p>Thus, the attenuation band exists while Ω &gt; 2 1+2βη 2 a 1+4β whereas the upper limit of the transmission band is restricted to Ω &lt; 2. The shifting of the attenuation band towards lower frequencies can be represented by</p>
        <p>Here we conclude that the inertial amplifier mass, in the absence of the discrete local resonator, creates only a single attenuation peak in the imaginary wavenumber part of the disperison diagram. While this configuration provides a semi-infinite attenuation profile above the IA antiresonance, the strength of this leveled attenuation (i.e., the maximum value of the imaginary wave number as the frequency goes to infinite) is relatively weak. Now, a conventional local resonant mass m is attached to the baseline mass M of the chain; we will occasionally refer to this as the "tuning" mass. First, the coefficient of the vertical spring supporting the inertial amplifier-which in practice may be viewed as a representation of the actual stiffness of the joints-is assumed to be k a = 0, which means the frequency ratio of the inertial amplifier is also 0.</p>
        <p>The complex dispersion diagram including both propagation and attenuation bands (with the strength of the latter indicated by the absolute value in the imaginary wavenumber domain) is computed from Eq. 8. The effects of the inertial amplifier mass ratio β, the resonator natural frequency ratio η r , and the resonator mass ratio θ r on the overall dispersion curves, specifically the attenuation profile, are examined closely in this section. For β = 0.12, the attenuation profile exhibits two uncoupled peaks, the lower one corresponding to a standard local resonance and the higher one representing an IA antiresonance. For β = 0.12, transition has occurred to an attenuation profile with two coupled peaks. The distance in the frequency domain between the two coupled attenuation peaks is observed to grow with further increase in β. All results are for a vertical stiffness k a = 0, i.e., η a = 0.</p>
        <p>θ r , respectively. From Fig. 4, the following observations are noted:</p>
        <p>• With increase in inertial amplifier mass ratio β, the IA band gap widens and its central frequency drops to lower values.</p>
        <p>• The two attenuation peaks, namely mass peak Ω m and stiffness peak Ω s are located where the effective mass and effective stiffness of the medium turns to infinite and zero respectively. Only the stiffness peak shifts to the low frequency side and the mass peak remains constant while β is increased.</p>
        <p>• Below a cut off value in β, defined as β * = 1 η 2 r (1+θr) , the double-peak IA attenuation phenomenon cannot be observed. In particular, for β = 0.12, we notice that the IA antiresonance peak is not coupled with the attenuation peak associated with the local resonance of the tuning mass at η r = 2.0. However, for higher values of β these two attenuation peaks couple and generate a relatively large IA band gap with these two peaks appearing inside the band gap.</p>
        <p>Mass peak, Stiffnes peak, The distance in the frequency domain between the two coupled attenuation peaks is observed to grow with further increase in η r . All results are for a vertical stiffness k a = 0, i.e., η a = 0.</p>
        <p>As for Fig. 5, it illustrates the following:</p>
        <p>• The IA band gap width increases with the resonator natural frequency ratio η r beyond a transitional value of η r = 0.5; below this value the chain behaves mostly like a conventional locally resonant chain.</p>
        <p>• The location of the mass peak varies with the natural frequency ratio of resonator; however, the stiffness peak remains constant.</p>
        <p>• At η r = 0.5, the transition point, the attenuation due to the stiffness peak vanishes and a single attenuation peak (mass peak) in the dispersion diagram is noticed.</p>
        <p>• At that transitional value, the resonance due to the tuning mass and the inertial amplifier mass matches and a cross-over occurs.</p>
        <p>Mass ratio of resonator, Unlike the previous two cases, the IA band gap and the frequency of the two peaks remain practically constant when the tuning mass ratio θ r is varied; however, the level of attenuation increases with increasing θ r , as shown in Fig. 6. The tuning mass may be made to have a more influential effect by changing other parameters in the system as shown below.</p>
        <p>To quantify the properties of an IA band gap with double attenuation peaks, three metrics are proposed as shown in Fig. 7. The metric µ min denotes the minimum level of attenuation achieved within the IA band gap within the frequency range Ω min as illustrated in the figure. As for the metric Ω max , this represents the conventional band-gap width. In both frequency metrics, the bandwidth is normalized with respect to its central frequency value, ω mid . Upon normalization, Ω min and Ω max are denoted Ω * min and Ω * max , respectively.</p>
        <p>The variation of the metrics as a function of each of β, η r , and θ r is plotted in Fig. 8.</p>
        <p>Figures 8(a) and 8(b) illustrate that an IA band gap exists after certain cut-off values of β and η r , respectively. With increasing β and η r , beyond certain values, a wider IA band gap is possible at the cost of low level of attenuation µ min . In contrast, all metrics monotonically increase with θ r . We observe in Fig. 8(b) that compared to when m = 0, a design with a relatively elevated level of minimum attenuation over practically the entire width of the band gap is possible for a band gap with a relative width of 130%. In contrast, a design is possible with a 15-fold increase in µ min but with a relatively smaller band-gap size. These results show a trade-off between large band-gap size and minimum attenuation strength. The regions shaded in green in Fig. 8 represent the net "gain" in minimum attenuation strength due to the addition of the locally resonant mass and the consequent generation of the coupled double-peak band gap.</p>
        <p>The addition of a locally resonant mass, on the other hand, increases the total weight of the unit cell; this represents a design challenge when there is a constraint on the total weight. Future investigations may explore optimization studies with the additional constraint of keeping the total mass within the unit cell fixed.</p>
        <p>To determine the effect of the vertical spring stiffness k a on the IA band gap and attenuation profile, the inertial amplifier natural frequency ratio η a is varied; this is shown in the form of the complex dispersion diagram in the top panel of Fig. 9. A contour plot of the attenuation level as a function of the inertial amplification factor β for the different η a values is plotted in the lower panel of Fig. 9. This figure depicts that as k a increases, i.e., η a no longer remains 0, the IA band gap shifts towards higher frequencies. And, critically, when η a &gt; η r1 , the IA band-gap character is lost and the chain behaves mostly like a conventional locally resonance chain. Therefore, a lower value of k a is desirable to realize a wider and lower-frequency IA band. This underlies the importance of having a quality lever, with maximum lever rigidity, minimal joint stiffness, etc., when realising this system in practice. Inertial amplification factor, E</p>
        <p>Finally, we show that for our proposed inertial amplifier chain, the frequency-dependent dynamic effective mass and effective stiffness exhibit a rich set of properties that vary qualitatively with the key design parameters β, η r , and θ r . Specifically, negative effective mass, negative effective stiffness, and dual negative mass and stiffness behavior are realized as indicated in Fig. 10. The following observations are made:</p>
        <p>• The dynamic effective stiffness becomes negative over a broad region in the top-right corner of the Ωβ spectrum, in contrast to a narrow region in the Ωθ r and Ωη r spectra.</p>
        <p>• The dynamic effective stiffness becomes negative in a narrow region in the bottomleft corner of the Ωβ spectrum, in contrast to broad top-left and bottom-right regions in the Ωθ r and Ωη r spectra.</p>
        <p>• Attenuation bands generate in two scenarios:</p>
        <p>1. When either of the dynamic effective medium properties, mass or stiffness, turns negative, or • When these two attenuation peaks fall between the two edge frequencies, i.e., Ω c1</p>
        <p>and Ω c2 , coupled double-peak attenuation occurs.</p>
        <p>• For the set of parameters for which the mass peak and stiffness peak coincide, a significantly high level of attenuation is attained.</p>
        <p>• A double negative region emerges where the dynamic effective mass and stiffness are simultaneously negative [33,34]. Observation of a double negative band in a similar chain mode was reported in Ref. [35], although no reference was made on the possibility of coupled peaks in the attenuation spectrum.</p>
        <p>The results illustrated in Fig. 11 provide confirmation that the attenuation characteristics shown in all the complex dispersion diagrams presented carry over to a corresponding 10-unit cell long finite chain. We observe that the transmittance through a finite chain significantly reduces in a manner that directly correlates with the attenuation in the dispersion, with the two coupled attenuation peaks matching in their appearance. Noticeably, we observe that in absence of the attached resonator, the effective mass of the system becomes frequency independent.</p>
        <p>The mass-spring-inertial amplifier configuration presented in Fig. 1 is a canonical configuration that serves the purpose of providing a demonstration of the core concept of coupling an IA antiresonance with an attenuation peak associated with a standard separately attached local resonator. This cononical framework has enabled rigorous analytical characterization and investigation of the concept. However, it is readily extendable to more complex configurations in higher dimensions. For example, a quasi-1D configuration comprising multiple interconnected layers of masses and springs could form the base chain [36]. Realization using standard mechanical components such as rods and beams is also possible [22,28]. Extension to higher dimensions may also be explored by considering, for example, a cage-type 2D [37] or 3D [38] structure to form the base medium from which levered substructures and seperately attached local resonators could emerge. Incorporation of damping in the system-to yield metadamping behavior [39][40][41][42]-and/or nonlinearity [43][44][45] are also other promising future avenues of investigation.</p>
        <p>A novel concept for the realization of an inertial amplification band gap with double attenuation peaks has been presented. The concept is based on coupling a mass that is inertially amplified by a lever arm with a secondary mass that is separately attached to the backbone chain. This secondary mass on its own represent a conventional local resonator that may be introduced to any system as a separate attachment. Upon tuning, the local resonance of this mass couples with the resonance associated with the inertially amplified mass leading to a low and wide IA band gap with a characteristic double peaks in the attenuation profile. Compared to a corresponding IA chain with only a single attenuation peak and a semi-infinite but weak attenuation profile at frequencies above this peak, here we get a spatial attenuation profile that is finite in its frequency range, but strong in its intensity. A key advantage is that the band-gap edge frequencies, width, and minimum attenuation strength may all be optimized through this coupled IA-local resonance configurational concept.</p>
        <p>Given these favorable characteristics, we derived mathematical expressions for the conditions for transition to the double-peak coupled regime. Extensive mappings of the response were then provided to conceptualize the effects of key parameters in the chain, namely the inertial amplification factor, the resonator natural frequency ratio, and the local resonator mass ratio, on the band-gap location, size, and attenuation profile. Furthermore, a vertical spring supporting the inertial amplifier mass pair is introduced to quantify-from a practical perspective-the effect of the lever link stiffness (which in our model is treated as rigid) on the degree of inertial amplification as realized in the dynamical response. Finally, three IA band-gap metrics have been introduced to characterize the band-gap relative size and attenuation properties, and a parametric optimization study was conducted to elucidate the effects of the various chain parameters on these metrics.</p>
        <p>It is observed that complex relations unfold with changing the IA and local resonator masses; for example, the minimum attenuation strength experiences an optimal point that coincides with the lowest relative band-gap size. These results pave the way for the design of a new class of inertially amplified phononic materials with superior IA band-gap performance characteristics.</p>
        <p>This appears in both IA materials (represented by infinite models)[22] and IA structures (represented by finite models)[20][21][22].</p>
