        <p>Aim: Palms are an iconic, diverse, and often abundant component of tropical ecosystems that provide 6 many ecosystem services. Being monocots, tree palms are evolutionarily, morphologically, and 7 physiologically distinct from other trees, and these differences have important consequences for 8 ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration and storage) and in terms of responses to climate 9 change. We quantified global patterns of tree palm relative abundance to help improve understanding of 10 tropical forests and reduce uncertainty about these ecosystems under climate change. 11 Location: Tropical and subtropical moist forests 12 Time period: Current 13 Major taxa studied: Palms (Arecaceae)</p>
        <p>14 Methods: We assembled a pantropical dataset of 2,548 forest plots (covering 1,191 ha) and quantified 15 tree palm (i.e., 10 cm diameter) abundance relative to co-occurring non-palm trees. We compared the ‚â• 16 relative abundance of tree palms across biogeographical realms, and tested for associations with 17 paleoclimate stability, current climate, edaphic conditions, and metrics of forest structure.</p>
        <p>18 Results: On average, relative abundance of tree palms was more than five times larger between 19 Neotropical locations and other biogeographic realms. Tree palms were absent in most locations outside 20 the Neotropics but present in &gt;80% of Neotropical locations. Relative abundance of tree palms was more 21 strongly associated with local conditions (e.g., higher mean annual precipitation, lower soil fertility, 22 shallower water table, and lower plot-mean wood density) than metrics of long-term climate stability. Life 23 form diversity also influenced the patterns; palm assemblages outside the Neotropics comprise many 24 non-tree (e.g., climbing) palms. Finally, we show that tree palms can influence estimates of above-ground 25 biomass but the magnitude and direction of the effect requires additional work.</p>
        <p>26 Conclusions: Tree palms are not just quintessentially tropical, they are overwhelmingly Neotropical.</p>
        <p>27 Future work to understand the contributions of tree palms to biomass estimates and carbon cycling will be 28 particularly critical in Neotropical forests.</p>
        <p>For each location, we calculated relative basal area (BA palm ) and relative abundance (RA palm ) of 142 tree palms as the sum of tree palm basal area or number of tree palm individuals divided by the total 143 basal area or total number of stems. These relative metrics of tree palm abundance reduce variation 144 caused by differences in sample area and stem density across locations. Results based on BA palm and 145 RA palm were highly correlated and we present and discuss BA palm results in the main text (results based on 146 RA palm are provided in the Supplementary Materials).</p>
        <p>To address our hypothesis about the link between long-term climatic stability and tree palm 150 abundance (the climate-stability hypothesis), we used several variables that likely had major impacts on 151 the distributions of palms and their habitats (e.g., Melo et al., 2018). Specifically, we calculated the 152 absolute difference (or "anomaly") between the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21,000 years ago) and 153 modern climatological averages , for both mean annual precipitation (mm yr -1 ) and 154 precipitation in the driest quarter (mm quarter -1 ) using 30 arcsec (~1 km 2 ) resolution data from CHELSA 155 (Karger et al., 2017). We used LGM variables based on data from the Palaeoclimate Modelling 156 Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) and output from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) 157 (Karger et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>We used several datasets to address our hypothesis about contemporary ecological controls on 159 tree palm relative abundance (the contemporary conditions hypothesis). For contemporary climate, we 160 extracted mean annual precipitation (mm yr -1 ) and precipitation in the driest quarter (mm quarter -1 ) for 161 each location from the 30 arcsec (~1 km 2 ) resolution CHELSA dataset (Karger et al., 2017). For edaphic 162 conditions, we extracted cation exchange capacity (CEC; a general proxy for soil fertility; cmol+/kg) at 250 163 m resolution from the SoilGrids website (www.soilgrids.org). We focused on CEC because prior work has 164 shown associations between forest composition (including palm diversity) and soil fertility (Muscarella et 165 al., 2019). We extracted depth to water table (m) from the 30 arcsec (~1 km 2 ) resolution database of Fan 166 et al. (2013). We examined how conditions at the study locations reflect the range of conditions in their 167 respective biogeographic realms by sampling each variable at 10,000 random points in each realm S1). We extracted values for the predictor variables listed above based on the mean latitude and 169 longitude of plots in each location.</p>
        <p>We calculated two proxies for turnover rates in each location. First, because forests with faster 171 turnover rates tend to have shorter canopies (Feldpausch et al., 2011), we estimated maximum canopy 172 height for each location based on the tree inventory data. More specifically, since most plots do not 173 include measured data on tree height, we used the '
            <rs type="software">BIOMASS</rs>' package (R√©jou-M√©chain et al., 2017) to 174 estimate the height of each individual tree based on its diameter using the geographically-based 175 allometric equation of Chave et al. (2014). We used the 95 th percentile of estimated tree height in each 176 location as a metric of maximum canopy height (comparable results were obtained when using the 99 th 177 percentile). Second, we calculated the basal-area weighted mean (CWM) wood density for each location 178 by matching wood density data from the global wood density database (Chave et al., 2009;Zanne et al., 179 2009) with the relative basal area of each species in each location. CWM wood density reflects life-history 180 strategies of trees and stands with lower values of CWM wood density tend to have more rapid turnover 181 rates (Phillips et al., 2004;Chave et al., 2009;Phillips et al., 2019). Because we were interested in the 182 relationship between local environmental conditions and palm relative abundance patterns, we excluded 183 palms when calculating CWM wood density. However, note that CWM wood density values per location 184 were highly correlated whether or not palms were included (Pearson's r = 0.98). Species-level mean 185 wood density values were available for 51% of the individual stems (representing 61% of the total BA), 186 genus-level mean values were used for 37% of the individuals (30% of the total BA), family-level mean 187 values were used for 9% of the individuals (6% of the total BA), and we excluded the remaining 3% of 188 individuals (representing 3% of the total BA) that were not identified to the family level. The computed 189 CWM wood density values were highly correlated with CWM wood density values computed based only 190 on species-level data (Pearson's r=0.87), genus-level data (Pearson's r=0.99), or family-level data 191 (Pearson's r=0.99). 194 As a first step to assess general patterns of tree palm occurrence, we used t-tests to compare each 195 environmental covariate described above between locations with and without tree palms, separately for 196 each realm. We log-transformed all covariates except for CWM wood density prior to analysis.
        </p>
        <p>Then, to assess associations between tree palm abundance and covariates, we fit a Bayesian 198 zero-inflated version of the beta regression (BeZI) (Ospina &amp; Ferrari, 2010) since our response variable of 199 interest (BA palm ) is a proportion and tree palms were absent from many (61%) locations. We modeled 200 BA palm at each location, i, using a beta-distributed random variable ~ BeZI ( , , ), which represents</p>
        <p>201 a mixture of beta and Bernoulli distributions defined as:</p>
        <p>202</p>
        <p>BeZI (ùëù 0ùëñ , ùúá ùëñ , œï) = { ùëù 0 , ùë¶ = 0</p>
        <p>(1 -ùëù 0 )f(y; ùúá, œï), ùë¶ ‚àà (0,1)</p>
        <p>The parameter is the probability of tree palms being absent from a location and , is the beta ùëù 0 ùëì(ùë¶; ùúá œï)</p>
        <p>204 density function of BA palm at locations where tree palms are present: is the expected value and is a ùúá œï 205 precision parameter (Ospina &amp; Ferrari, 2010). For both components of the model (occurrence and relative 206 basal area), we modeled the relationship between the response variable, y, at each location, i, including 207 biogeographic realm as a random grouping variable, . We used the following model: , corresponds to the sum of area sampled in component plots at location Areaùëñ 215 i. We included the area term to account for possible correlation between area sampled and BA palm . Prior 216 to fitting the model, we centered and scaled each predictor variable by subtracting its mean and dividing it 217 by its standard deviation. This procedure facilitates model convergence and allows for the direct 218 comparison of relative effect sizes across predictor variables (Gelman &amp; Hill, 2006). The majority of model 219 covariates were little correlated (Pearson's |r| &lt; 0.3) but historical climate anomalies and current climate 220 conditions were moderately correlated (Pearson's r = 0.47 -0.71) (Table S1). Nonetheless, models fitted In this study, we were unable to directly assess the role of several potentially important drivers of 361 palm abundance. First, humans have affected tropical landscapes for millennia (Roberts et al., 2017) and, 362 especially given the many uses of palms (C√°mara-Leret et al., 2017), past and recent human activity 363 could influence observed contemporary patterns of palm abundance. Levis et al. (2017) showed that 364 domesticated tree species, including several tree palms, were more abundant in forests near 365 archaeological sites in Amazon forests, suggesting long-term human impacts on the composition and 366 structure of tropical forests. In contrast, Piperno et al. (2019) reported a lack of evidence for ancient 367 human impacts on palm abundance in Amazonian terra firme forests. Humans have clearly impacted 368 forests in other biogeographic realms as well (Malhi et al., 2013;Hunt &amp; Rabett, 2014;Roberts et al., 369 2017).but we do not expect human activity to have altered the broad biogeographic patterns we report.</p>
        <p>370 The degree to which human activities impacted populations of palms and other trees requires more study.</p>
        <p>Second, we cannot rule out that the historical presence or absence of certain palm lineages 372 influences patterns of palm abundance. Palms display strong spatial phylogenetic structure (Kissling et 373 al., 2012b; Fig. 7), showing that different regions are characterized by different lineages. If certain 374 lineages have a particular tendency to evolve highly abundant tree palms, this could drive patterns like 375 the ones observed here. For example, the palm tribes Euterpeae, Iriarteae, and Cocoseae, which include 376 the most abundant palms in Amazonia (ter Steege et al., 2013) are absent outside the Neotropics (except 377 for a few Attaleinae species in South Africa and Madagascar, which interestingly are not particularly 378 abundant there). Also, non-human animal seed dispersers influence palm diversification and diversity via 379 eco-evolutionary interactions (Onstein et al., 2017), and these mutualisms could also potentially influence 380 contemporary palm abundance patterns. For instance, Onstein et al. (2018) argued that palms with 381 megafaunal fruits (some of which could also be large tree palms) may have reduced abundance and 382 increased extinctions due to the extinction of their megafaunal dispersers (also see Doughty et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>383 Quantifying these effects will require additional phylogenetic analyses, which will be attempted soon once 384 a comprehensive species level phylogeny of the palm family is available.</p>
        <p>Finally, our dataset does not include swamp habitats and some tree palms are known for forming 386 monodominant stands, especially in swampy conditions associated with large carbon pools. For example, 387 palm swamps in the Congo basin, Amazonia, and southeast Asia cover millions of hectares and store -and below-ground (Kahn &amp; Mejia, 1990;Dargie et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>389 Better understanding of these unique habitats requires additional work; recent progress has been made 390 using various remote sensing techniques (e.g., Dargie et al., 2017). 391 392 Implications for above-ground biomass estimates 393 One motivation for our study was to better understand the potential error introduced to estimates of 394 above-ground biomass (AGB) when tree palms are pooled with other trees. Specifically, standard 395 allometric equations generated for trees that estimate AGB from stem diameter perform relatively poorly 396 when estimating biomass for palms because, unlike other trees, diameter and height growth in palms are 397 largely decoupled. The magnitude of error this introduces clearly depends, in part, on tree palm relative 398 abundance. In our dataset, pooling tree palms with other trees added error to AGB estimates but the 399 direction of the error was not consistent. Pooling palms with dicots most often led to an overestimation of 404 were &lt; 1% in more than 90% of locations where BApalm was &lt; 5%, indicating that error from palms is 405 probably negligible when palms are minor components of total forest basal area. However, the difference 406 between the two methods increases with BApalm and the difference ranged from -15 to 6% in our 407 dataset. Future analyses using data on stem height are needed to refine these estimates and additional 408 species-and region-specific palm allometric models will be important to improve AGB estimates in many 409 Neotropical forests where tree palms are abundant.</p>
        <p>412 To some extent, the patterns we report reflect these differences in palm life diversity across 413 biogeographic realms. For example, clades that assume a climbing form (e.g., rattans in the subfamily 414 Calamoideae) constitute a major component of palm diversity in the IndoMalayan and Australasian 415 biogeographical realms (Couvreur et al., 2015). In the Neotropics, in contrast, many abundant palm We propose several additional potential reasons for generally low tree palm abundance in the 444 Afrotropics and IndoMalaya in addition to the differences in life forms described above. The first may be 445 related to the generally tall forest canopies in these realms, especially IndoMalaya, compared to the 446 Neotropics (Banin et al., 2014). If arborescent palms in these regions do not grow tall enough to reach the 447 top of the canopy, then a wide stem may not represent a feasible strategy. These conditions may favor 448 the evolution of alternative life forms, including climbers (Couvreur et al., 2015). In fact, Couvreur et al. 449 (2015) reported a link between diversification of the climbing life form in palms and forest canopy height.</p>
        <p>450 Additional synthetic work integrating abundance patterns with evolutionary drivers of palm life form 451 variation could be a fruitful research avenue. Second, for IndoMalaya, we note that dry quarter 452 precipitation is greater in locations with palms than in locations where palms were absent (Fig S2D). On 453 average, locations in this realm without palms have only ~50 mm rain during the driest quarter while sites 454 with palms have &gt;100 mm. It is possible that minimum monthly rainfall generally limits palm occurrence in 455 many areas that have months of rainfall &lt; 100 mm, which includes much of mainland SE Asia.</p>
        <p>458 The results of our first ever global analysis of tree palm abundance show that tree palms are not just 459 quintessentially tropical, but they are overwhelmingly Neotropical. Although paleoclimate conditions 460 appear to have a strong influence on global palm diversity, tree palm relative abundance was more 461 strongly related to current ecological conditions, and tree palm abundance patterns may be particularly 462 sensitive to future climate change. Future research should focus on specific drivers (and interactions 463 among drivers) linked to tree palm abundance within biogeographical realms. We suggest that stronger 464 consideration of the influence of palms can reduce uncertainty in biomass estimates. Especially in the 465 Neotropics, improving our understanding of carbon cycling will require additional fieldwork to measure 466 palm height and develop new allometric equations for palms. High tree palm relative abundance in 467 locations with low average wood density (presumably, high-turnover forests) may also dramatically impact 468 estimates of forest productivity since measurements of palm height growth are typically neglected. We 469 also show that understanding general patterns of abundance across the entire palm family will require 470 additional work to understand macroevolutionary drivers of palm life form diversity.
