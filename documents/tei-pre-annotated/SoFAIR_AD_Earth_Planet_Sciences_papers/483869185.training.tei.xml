        <p>Earth building is experiencing a renaissance due to the emerging recognition of the damage the construction industry is doing to the global environment. Research over the past three decades has identified the hygroscopic nature of these materials, and our understanding of the factors governing their hydromechanical properties is now mature. However, little work has been done to unify methods to assess material durability: namely, how exposure to degrading agents, predominantly water, impacts a structure's service life. Although strength is usually of primary concern to engineers, it is undeniable that earthen structures usually fail due to durability, rather than strength, issues. As earthen architecture and demands made of the material become more ambitious, the need for robust guidelines on how to predict the longevity of these structures becomes paramount.</p>
        <p>This paper presents a framework for assessing the durability of earthen materials based on perceived routes of exposure to water. The framework is built upon the findings of a review of nearly 60 articles discussing original durability testing programmes, comprising 118 investigations and almost 700 soil and stabiliser combinations. From these works, 12 assessment methodologies were</p>
        <p>Emerging understanding of the detrimental effects of human activities on the global climate has prompted scientific interest in low-embodied energy building techniques, for example earthen construction. This interest, coupled with improved characterisation techniques, prompted a proliferation of written material over the past three decades, as shown in Figure 1 for search term returns from the Science Direct repository relating to earthen construction. The majority or these works concern themselves with material hydromechanical properties (strength and stiffness), usually with a view to identify suitable raw materials for construction based on some accepted mechanical benchmark, e.g. minimum compressive strengths as specified in New Zealand Standard NZS 4298:1998 [68]. However, while strength is a major factor in structural design, it must be acknowledged that the failure of earthen buildings is predominantly due to durability, rather than strength, issues [60,29].</p>
        <p>Durability can be defined as the ability of a structural element to resist environmental or anthropogenic wear, damage or decay. In the case of earthen Cumulative number of research and review articles discussing earthen construction techniques recorded per year as indicated by Science Direct keyword searches. Some terms, for example "adobe" and "mud brick" are interchangeable and so some duplication in the returns is expected. "Adobe" was combined with "soil" to remove results relating to software structures, durability is predominantly associated with resistance to water (although insect/animal, chemical and thermal attack may also impact a structure's longevity [44,29]). Widespread concern regarding the moisture-resistance of earth buildings is generally well founded and multiple examples exist of structures where poor protection against attacking moisture has led to severe degradation or failure. For example, Figure 2 shows how the surface of a rammed earth wall in the Loire Department, France, has severely degraded due to prolonged exposure to direct rain and freezing temperatures.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, moisture ingress occurs primarily from wind-driven rainfall, condensation, infiltration, absorption from the surrounding ground, and from general building use. Examples of potential exposure routes are shown in Figure 3. Moisture alone is not particularly damaging if it is able to evaporate before significantly penetrating the earthen material [43]. However, if it is allowed to build up, it can cause material deterioration due to hydromechanical weakening (the reader is referred to Jaquin et al. [49], Gerard et al. [38], Beckett et al. [10], Xu et al. [98] for a detailed explanation of this phenomenon) or the establishment of differential hydraulic, thermal and expansion gradients [35,76]. Intense wind-driven rainfall during violent storms can also cause significant erosion damage as energies are sufficient to remove particles mechanically [67]. Although many or all of these risk factors can be minimised with appropriate architectural design, it is those cases where such design is poor or absent that place durability demands on the materials themselves. These demands will become critical as earthen structures become architecturally more ambitious, e.g. the recent 40 m high SIREWALL tower at the Telenor '345' head office complex near Islamabad, Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Durability mitigation has, for the most part, been associated with strength; high strengths are specified to provide the prerequisite resistance against dam- age, rather than to resist structural loads. This is in part due to the lack of universally accepted testing methodologies for material durability and part due to the ease and widespread accessibility of strength testing methods and facilities.</p>
        <p>We must also accept that the perception that modern building materials (concrete, fired masonry, steel and glass) are 'durable' with regards to their design lifespan, at least as far as domestic use is concerned, has reduced the perceived importance of regular maintenance or durability assessment [52]. However, the assumption that greater strengths impart greater durability places an emphasis and preference on stabilised construction methods (i.e. using cemetitious products to bind soil particles) [40,23]. Such methods exhibit higher embodied energies due to the manufacture, use and transport of these agents and so counter the aim of reducing embodied energy [5]. Furthermore, stabilisation may not protect the earthen element against all forms of degradation; stabilised materials, for example, may resist direct rainfall but can degrade under repeated wetting/drying or freeze/thaw cycles or long-term exposure to moisture [13]. This disparity has fuelled the opinion that existing tests are too aggressive or do not reproduce observed in situ performance [28], so that different tests are often specified for stabilised or unstabilised materials. Such a situation is detrimental to assessment standardisation; the desired position is, rather, one where all tests are applicable to all materials and the passing or failing of those tests reflects the material's suitability or lack thereof.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we review past literature discussing earthen material durability assessment to identify which methods are currently in use and for which materials. We examine how those results were interpreted and how they could be related to real performance. Based on this, we suggest a condensed list of durability tests that reflect likely exposure scenarios and can assess their impact on a structure's longevity quantitatively. We note, however, that methods used to mitigate erosion, for example inserting erosion breaks in rammed earth walls (e.g. Minke [58]) are outwith the scope of this article. x. freeze/thaw testing;</p>
        <p>xi. Atterberg limit testing; and</p>
        <p>xii. shrinkage testing.</p>
        <p>The breakdown of these articles by year is shown in Figure 4. Construction techniques examined within the articles and their number of testing instances are shown in Figure 5. Clearly, this is a small subset (roughly 3%) of the overall available literature (Figure 1), which serves to highlight how infrequently durability concerns are examined as opposed to other, more traditional parameters.</p>
        <p>We cannot, however, claim to have catalogued every instance of durability testing; rather, only those research articles where original tests were discussed were included, with a publication cutoff date of the end of 2018.</p>
        <p>As shown in Figure 5, the majority of the identified articles examined the behaviour of stabilised compressed earth blocks (SCEB), rammed earth (RE) and mud brick (which includes adobe), which reflects these materials' popularity above other available techniques when it comes to academic research [48]. Here, we distinguish between earth blocks which gain their integrity only through compression (CEBs) and those which are also stabilised (SCEB). However, we [5]. This result correlates well with expected strength improvement; for suitable soil types and similar stabiliser amounts, greater strengths are found for cement stabilisation than for lime, FA or GGBS [25]. This outcome may seem to reinforce the original postulate that only stabilised materials can pass the AET. However, it should be noted that, beyond a certain stabiliser content, all stabilised materials will be sufficiently resistant to high pressure water [9,5].</p>
        <p>Therefore, although we cannot conclusively say that no unstabilised material could pass the AET, results reviewed here indicate that the AET (or mAET) is more a test of stabiliser effectiveness rather than a predictor of erosion rates likely to be encountered in the field.</p>
        <p>Guettala et al. [40] and Heathcote [45,46] used degradation observed under natural exposure (4 and 3 years respectively) to modify the AET to better match in situ erosion over a given time, either by reducing the delivered pressure or modifying the spray distance. However, Ogunye and Boussabaine [71], and later</p>
        <p>Van Damme and Houben [90], noted that natural exposure generally does not comprise extreme events, so that observed degradation arises due to alternative mechanisms, e.g. prolonged wetting and drying cycles. Given the aforementioned extremity of the AET, it is therefore questionable whether matching it to long-term degradation is appropriate.</p>
        <p>Drip testing predominantly comprises the Geelong Drip Test (NZS 4298 [68] and HB-195 [97]) and the Swinburne Accelerated Erosion Test (HB-195 and Spanish Standards UNE 41410 [1]). In the Geelong test, 100 mL of water under an initial head of 60 mm drips onto the face of an inclined specimen from a wick suspended 400 mm above the impact site. The specimen is inclined at 27 degrees (a slope of 1:2) to the horizontal and the test must be completed within 20 to 60 minutes. Pitting cannot exceed 15 mm as measured using a blunt 3 mm diameter rod. In the Swinburne test, a continuous 5 mm diameter stream of water of constant 1.5 m head falls vertically onto the face of the specimen for 10 minutes. Pitting cannot exceed 30 mm as measured using a blunt 3 mm diameter rod. For both tests, moisture penetration at the impact point should not exceed 120 mm. 8 articles presented results for drip testing.</p>
        <p>Drip tests were originally developed for mud bricks to simulate less severe, indirect rainfall impacting material surfaces. Stabilised and unstabilised materials were therefore able to pass these tests in 6 out of the 8 identified investigations;</p>
        <p>failures were associated with unstabilised materials with lower density (poured earth [2] and adobes coated with Carrageenan (a natural polymer [65]). Unstabilised specimens with applied surface coatings [2,65], those containing fibres [7] and those with low or non-hydraulic stabilisation (biopolymers [65,61] and fly ash with activators [83]) also passed, although with greater erosion depths than for more heavily stabilised specimens (e.g. hydraulic lime or cement).</p>
        <p>Nakamatsu et al. [65] and Seco et al. [81] compared drip test results to materials exposed to natural conditions for 3 (summer only) and 18 months (starting in winter) respectively. Nakamatsu et al. [65], testing adobe bricks mixed or coated with Carrageenan, did not find any degradation after the relatively short exposure but noted that no rainfall occurred during that period.</p>
        <p>However, exposed materials performed poorly on subsequent drip testing compared to non-exposed counterparts.</p>
        <p>In general, specimens fail if more than 15% water is absorbed however higher 255 limits may be set (e.g. 20% in da Silva Milani and Freire [30] and da Silva Milani</p>
        <p>and Labaki [31]). Given its simplicity, it is unsurprising that immersion testing 257 was the most frequently performed test out of those identified.</p>
        <p>As for the WBT, no unstabilised materials (or unstabilised cob with fibres 259 [37,54]) survived immersion. Gypsum-stabilised mud brick also failed [3] of Absorption" (AS/NZS 4456.17 [78]) and "Wet/dry ap-277 praisal" (HB 195 [97] and NZS 4298 [68]): all methods are similar. A saturated, absorbent material (usually florists' foam but Eires et al. [33] used, for example, wet sand) is placed in a tray of water so that its topmost surface is just above that of the water (distance varies). Specimens to be tested are dried under ambient or oven conditions, depending on the test (earthen materials are usually dried to ambient). Specimens are weighed prior to testing and then one face is placed in contact with the saturated material. Specimen weight is then recorded at set intervals; in most processes, weighing is carried out several times within the first 5 minutes of testing, to examine initial sorption rates. Unlike for previous tests, no specific pass or fail criteria have been specified. Rather, the test is usually comparative; the lower the absorption rate, the better the performance. In the absence of a specified target, results from Hall and Djerbib [41] indicate that 0.4 kg/m 2 min 1 /2 is a suitable upper limit for unstabilised rammed earth. Stabilised materials can be sufficiently durable at higher values, e.g. 4.5 kg/m 2 min 1 /2 for RE stabilised with 4% Portland Cement [92]. Alternatively, Guettala et al. [40] specified a stricter failure criterion for stabilised CEBs as absorbing &gt;2.5% water (by mass) after being in contact with the absorbent material for 7 days.</p>
        <p>Like immersion, adsorption testing is technologically simple and so its popularity is warranted. Furthermore, it is far less severe than the AET, WBT or immersion test and so is suitable for testing unstabilised materials. As expected, processes associated with decreasing hydraulic conductivity (stabilisation, increased clay content or increased density) improved performance (i.e.</p>
        <p>decreased the absorption rate); CEBs stabilised with cement and lime (combinations greater than 5%) in Guettala et al. [40] were sufficiently durable to survive contact with the absorbent surface for 7 days. Contrariwise, unstabilised materials with higher sand contents or lower dry densities [42,18] were susceptible to degradation (failing the limits specified by Hall and Djerbib [41]).</p>
        <p>Guettala et al. [40] and Seco et al. [81] compared absorption test results</p>
        <p>to degradation observed for specimens exposed to natural conditions. In both cases, those materials showing faster final absorption rates or greater absorbed masses also performed the worst under natural exposure. Agreement between the absorption test and natural exposure is reasonable, as rainfall can be expected to wet predominantly only one side of an exposed material, rather than all sides as is the case during the immersion test or WBT. Hall and Djerbib [41] also noted that evaporation at the dry surfaces establishes a hygrothermal gradient across the specimen, prompting salt dissolution or deposition and efflorescence which cannot be examined when specimens are submerged. Meek et al.</p>
        <p>[55] also demonstrated a good (but negative) correlation between adsorption and corrosion potential; the faster a material is able to absorb (and by extension, desorb) water, the better it is as protecting embedded steel against waterborne attack. Somewhat contradictorily, then, the adsorption test is better suited to reveal long-term performance than the (longer) WBT or immersion tests.</p>
        <p>Recent scholarship has demonstrated that earthen materials derive their behaviour from hygrothermal interactions and that strength, stiffness, thermal conductivity etc. are all governed by the amount of water trapped within the material and its distribution [49,24,12,38,11]. Strength testing for durability assessment contrasts the material's unconfined compressive strength when dried under ambient conditions or in an oven (at 60 to 70 • C) to that after the specimen has been submerged in water for 24 to 48 hours (IS 3495 and HB-195 [15,97]). Different minimum ratios between the wet and dry strength ratios are recommended for a material to be considered sufficiently durable; the CRAterre organisation (reported in Heathcote [45]) recommend a ratio &gt;0.5 for CEBs, whilst Heathcote [45] suggested a more relaxed 0.33-0.5. No limits have been suggested for other earthen construction types however 0.5 is generally accepted as a suitable target (e.g. [40]).</p>
        <p>14 articles presented results relating wet strengths or strength ratios to durability; given the near-ubiquitous nature of compression testing apparatus in engineering laboratories, the relative popularity of this test is to be expected. As for the WBT and immersion test, poorly stabilised adobe (incorporating saw dust and cow dung [94]), CEB and CS-CEB disintegrated during the immersion stage (granting a wet/dry strength ratio of zero). Stabilised specimens were able to survive immersion with the best performance achieved by the heaviest stabilisation regimes. The wet/dry strength ratio could therefore be considered a parallel metric to the outcomes of the WBT or immersion tests: it better represents stabiliser effectiveness against immersion than likely long term performance when exposed to water. This observation is supported by Heathcote [45], whose wet/dry strength ratio of 0.33 was recommended as the minimum performance required to pass the AET, rather than to provide long-term durability.</p>
        <p>Freeze/thaw testing requires that specimens be subjected to multiple temperature cycles from above to below 0 • C. Several variations exist, however the majority cycle between -15 • C to +20 • C over 24 hours. Specimens may be saturated for 24 hours prior to testing (e.g. PD CEN/TS 13286-54:2014 [22]) or tested from an air-dry condition. However, Bryan [19] notes that a sufficiently high initial degree of saturation is necessary before frost damage will occur; what that saturation is depends, in turn, on the material porosity, per-meability and time spent within the icing damage window (the reader is referred to Rempel and Rempel [76] for a comprehensive description of freeze/thaw damage mechanisms in earthen materials). Cycles are repeated up to 100 times and specimen unconfined compressive strength may be tested after cycling has been completed; performance is either assessed visually, by mass loss after testing or by means of a strength ratio. In the absence of pass/fail criteria, mass losses after testing (without brushing) of greater than 2% may be considered poor performance [73].</p>
        <p>Specialised equipment is required to deliver the required heating and cooling rates; consequently, only 4 articles presented results for freeze/thaw testing on CEB [73,81], RE [19] and fired masonry [89]. Furthermore, those tests that have been reported assessed several material qualities; hence, the condition of the specimen at the beginning of the test (e.g. dry, cured etc.) varied significantly, as did specimen performance. Overall, poorly stabilised materials (e.g. 5% cement in the presence of clay in Bryan [19]) degraded during testing. Tang et al.</p>
        <p>[89] also showed that higher initial degrees of saturation reduced performance.</p>
        <p>Seco et al. [81] found good agreement between freeze/thaw testing and degradation arising due to natural exposure. Greater research is required, however, to establish the nature of the correlation; it may be, for example, that degradation due to freeze/thaw testing matched that arising outdoors in that work as specimens were exposed to wintry conditions (regularly &lt;0 • C) over months 1-3 and 12-16 of testing. Pending that information, however, freeze/thaw testing may offer a realistic option to estimate long-term degradation over an accelerated timeframe.</p>
        <p>Only one of the identified articles [84] examined using changes in the Atterberg limits (i.e. material plastic and liquid limits) before and after durability testing to predict material durability. The rationale behind this was that sandy soils are best suited to cement stabilisation and so a minimum plastic or liquid index (or change in those indices) might be expected to delineate suitable materials. However, no correlation was found between material Atterberg limits and their performance under the WBT. This was likely due to the tests being carried out on remoulded fine material (i.e. that passing the 425µm sieve); as the WBT does not impart mineralogical changes, it is unlikely that any changes would be detected in the liquid or plastic limits. Although only one article is available for discussion it is nevertheless unlikely that Atterberg limit testing represents a useful method to assess material durability.</p>
        <p>Shrinkage testing for durability assessment refers to the shrinkage of the entire specimen when dried to ambient (or otherwise specified) conditions from manufacturing conditions. Earthen literature commonly refers to this as the "drying shrinkage"; this is not to be confused with "linear shrinkage" (e.g. BS 1377-2 [21]), which only uses the soil fine fraction (i.e.</p>
        <p>passing the 425µm sieve).</p>
        <p>Unlike the other tests identified in this review, drying shrinkage does not expose specimens to water; rather, it examines material performance as water is removed. Shrinkage is an important durability concern as cracking on drying can create preferential seepage paths (and so degradation). Material is placed into a long mould (usually ≥10 times as long as it is wide) at the required water content and compacted, as necessary, to the required density.</p>
        <p>The specimen is then released from the mould and shrinkage (assumed to be one-dimensional) observed until completion. According to NZS 4298:1998 [68] and HB-195 [97], &gt;10% shrinkage in the long dimension is unsuitable for most techniques. Greater shrinkage is acceptable for mud brick. &lt;2.5% shrinkage is unsuitable for mud brick making but suitable for stabilised rammed earth. Alternatively, the Kenya Bureau of Standards KS02-1070 [51], reported in Salim et al. [79], accepts specimens if crack lengths are &lt;50% of the dimension parallel to the crack and &lt;0.5 mm wide upon reaching constant mass.</p>
        <p>6 articles presented results for drying shrinkage and all materials passed the shrinkage criteria discussed above for their respective techniques. Shrinkage was affected by variations in cementitious additives (sugarcane bagasse ash [79],</p>
        <p>and Portland Cement [88,92]), fibres [88] and clay contents [92]. Shrinkage was unaffected when the same soil was stabilised with non-cementitious additives (pumice, glass, polyfoam and Kenaf fibres, Maniatidis et al. [53]). Kariyawasam</p>
        <p>and Jayasinghe [50] noted good agreement between shrinkage specimens and shrinkage observed in situ (judged by the size of shrinkage cracks for given panel sizes). The shrinkage test as defined above therefore appears to provide a useful assessment of real shrinkage in earthen structures.</p>
        <p>Rain simulation subjects specimens to low or high pressure water sprays of characteristics similar to natural rainfall. Ogunye and Boussabaine [70] developed a method to test multiple brick-sized specimens against low pressure rain.</p>
        <p>Hall [43] presented results for exposing full-sized walls to simulated wind-driven rainfall within a climatic chamber.</p>
        <p>Hall [43] exposed cement-stabilised (6% by mass) RE walls of three base soil types to static pressure-driven moisture ingress for 5 days. No erosion was found for either low (equivalent to 0.225 L/min) or high velocity (equivalent to 0.65L/min) rain; this result may have been expected, as similar materials were able to pass the AET (e.g. Bahar et al. [9]), which is more severe, with no damage. Furthermore, no signs of moisture penetration from the wet to the dry side were found; rather, moisture ingress was restricted to a thin (roughly 20 mm) layer of material on the wet side: the so-called "overcoat" effect. Notably, the four test walls shared similar absorption rates (as determined from measured runoff quantities) during rainfall simulation, which was contrary to results from absorption testing. It was suggested that this was due to the use of a dynamic water source during rain simulation, unlike the static source used in the absorption test. Unfortunately, Ogunye and Boussabaine [70] did not compare specimen performance to other testing methodologies or in situ conditions, however most specimens showed less than 1% mass loss. Rain simulation may therefore be considered, from the information that is available, to occupy a position between absorption and accelerated erosion testing; it neither captures extreme erosion episodes, as can the AET, nor moisture penetration as observed in the absorption test. The specialised nature of the rain simulation equipment already precludes its use by most laboratories; however, in light of the issues discussed above, it does not seem to be a useful method to assess durability.</p>
        <p>Prior to evaluating the merits of the testing methods discussed above, it must be noted that none of the reviewed articles examined the performance of in situ structures; merely isolated material specimens. This is in part due to the method used to select the reviewed articles but also to the difficulty in determining the causes for observed degradation and in obtaining samples from existing structures. In building the assessment framework, the danger is there-fore that the approach is founded upon presupposed degradation mechanisms as examined by the laboratory tests, rather than those that might be present in situ. However, it is clear that relating degradation to only one mechanism would not be appropriate [23,71,13]. The framework must therefore provide a route to assess multiple exposure scenarios, based on the anticipated conditions affecting a given structural component.</p>
        <p>A key observation to emerge from the review is the perception that surviving immersion is synonymous with long-term durability. From the discussion presented in the previous section, it is clear that this is not the case. Rather, the WBT, immersion, wet/dry strength and drip tests could be interpreted as assessments of short-term stabiliser efficacy (although that is not to say that unstabilised materials can never pass these tests, merely that the reviewed results suggest that is it unlikely). Long-term durability (as assessed by available exposure data) was, instead, better reflected by the absorption, shrinkage and freeze/thaw tests (although more information is required in the latter case).</p>
        <p>Accelerated erosion testing stood alone in this regard; although it was also considered to be a test of short-term stabiliser efficacy, it provided information on likely performance in extreme environments, e.g. under cyclonic conditions. The outcomes of the assessments of the individual testing methods are summarised in Table 1.</p>
        <p>The assessment framework for different perceived exposure routes was built upon these derived functions and is presented in Table 2. Several of the reviewed works precluded certain testing methods from their analyses (e.g. the AET) under the assumption that the material in question could not pass that test. The advantage of Table 2 is that it is independent of the earthen construction techniques and stabilisation methods; as demonstrated in the previous discussion, this is because stabilisation alone (for example) may not provide sufficient pro-tection against water damage depending on its efficacy, as well as the element's location within the structure and how that element was formed. Key material risks due to the different exposure routes are suggested but it would be simple for an assessor to add more risks (and associated testing methods) as required. A further advantage is that the majority of the recommended tests can be performed with simple equipment using similarly-sized specimens (e.g. 100 mm diameter, 200 mm high cylinders), which makes them more accessible to practitioners. Note that shrinkage testing does not feature in Table 2; this is because a material cannot be 'exposed' to shrinkage. Rather, all earthen materials should be tested after manufacture (either as individual units, e.g. mud bricks, or after construction, e.g. rammed earth) to show that the product satisfies the shrinkage requirements.</p>
        <p>A critical consideration not explicitly included in the assessment framework in Table 2 is that exposure routes may vary or evolve during an element's lifespan. Examples of ways in which exposure routes may vary are suggested in Table 3. Clearly, however, such evolution depends on the specific construction plan, conditions and setting of the structure in question. It is the implied role of the assessor to determine the principal exposure routes governing the specific structure at all stages of use. Examples of such a process may be as follows:</p>
        <p>A single-storey house comprises a north-facing lime-stabilised mud brick wall with little roof protection. The wall is not guarded from direct rain by any nearby vegetation. Construction began in the spring but the mud bricks, once manufactured, were stored outdoors over the winter. Assessors determine that the wall is likely to be exposed to direct rain, dripping water and wetting and drying cycles when in service. The mud bricks were also subjected to freezing temperatures when in storage, prior to construction. From An internal, two-storey unstabilised rammed earth wall is to be constructed on a concrete slab as part of a dwelling. Construction necessitates that it be built before the external walls and roof are in place, due to the large formwork.</p>
        <p>Assessors determine that the flat top of the wall will be exposed to direct rain and pooling water. The vertical wall sides will be exposed to direct rain, indirect rain and pooling at the base around the floor slab. However, the wall will be protected once the building envelope is in place and will be maintained at a reasonable temperature and humidity. The soil stockpile is not under threat of erosion as the material is not in a final condition. From Of those methods, immersion, absorption wire brush and strength testing were the most popular, likely due to the ease with which these tests can be completed in a modestly equipped laboratory.</p>
        <p>The review indicated that assessment methods could be divided into two categories: short-; and long-term durability. Short-term tests (AET, WBT, immersion, wet/dry strength and drip testing) focused on stabiliser efficacy against immersion and were largely unable to provide insight into likely in situ performance. Long-term tests (absorption, shrinkage and freeze/thaw testing)</p>
        <p>showed good correlation between testing outcomes and degradation due to natural exposure, albeit with limited evidence in some cases. Notably, unstabilised materials were more likely to survive the long-term tests but none passed the short term tests; this is not to say that unstabilised materials can never pass these tests, however it highlights the issue of unstabilised material survivability when exposed to immersion. Rain simulation and Atterberg limit testing, from the information available, were deemed not to be useful representations of Building upon the review, a framework to assess material durability was developed and examples of its use presented. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it is independent of the material, construction technique or stabilisation regime in question. Rather, the framework relates testing methods to a range of exposure scenarios, each arising from and dependent upon the construction environment. In so doing, it makes the explicit statement that results from one testing method cannot be used to predict those from another, unless both fall within the same exposure scenario. Formalising each testing method was outwith this paper's scope; however this will be completed as part of the upcoming updated release of the Standards Australia HB 195.</p>
        <p>, the rammed earth must therefore pass the following tests: AET; WBT; Geelong Drip Test or Swinburne Accelerated Erosion Test; absorption test. Given that the unstabilised rammed earth is unlikely to pass the AET, the assessors may recommend a modification to the material (e.g. stabilisation, in whole or in part) or the construction schedule (e.g. adding a temporary cover) to ensure adequate protection. The wall must also satisfy the shrinkage test requirements once constructed.</p>
        <p>Work presented in this article was carried out as part of the revision of Standards Australia Handbook HB 195 by Technical Committee BD-083. The committee would like to thank the support staff at Standards Australia for assisting with the coordination of this work.</p>
