        <p>Silicon (Si) is known to alleviate the adverse impact of different abiotic and biotic stresses by different mechanisms including morphological, physiological, and genetic changes. Photosynthesis, one of the most important physiological processes in the plant is sensitive to different stress factors. Several studies have shown that Si ameliorates the stress effects on photosynthesis by protecting photosynthetic machinery and its function. In stressed plants, several photosynthesis-related processes including PSII maximum photochemical quantum yield (Fv/Fm), the yield of photosystem II (φPSII), electron transport rates (ETR), and photochemical quenching (qP) were observed to be regulated when supplemented with Si, which indicates that Si effectively protects the photosynthetic machinery. In addition, studies also suggested that Si is capable enough to maintain the uneven swelling, disintegrated, and missing thylakoid membranes caused during stress. Furthermore, several photosynthesis-related genes were also regulated by Si supplementation. Taking into account the key impact of Si on the evolutionarily conserved process of photosynthesis in plants, this review article is focused on the aspects of silicon and photosynthesis interrelationships during stress and signaling pathways. The assemblages of this discussion shall fulfill the lack of constructive literature related to the influence of Si on one of the most dynamic and important processes of plant life i.e. photosynthesis.Silicon (Si) is known to alleviate the adverse impact of different abiotic and biotic stresses by different mechanisms including morphological, physiological, and genetic changes.

        <p>Despite the fact that silicon (Si) is a non-essential element for the plant, recent research has shown an extraordinary impact of Si, which is unparalleled to any other non-essential element for plants (Tripathi et al., 2017;Khan et al., 2021). The research on Si and plants can be traced back to 1969 when Lewin and Reimann indicated the importance of Si for living organisms (Lewin and Reimann, 1969). Since then, several studies have been performed to establish the importance of Si for plants (Chen et al., 2011;Haddad et al., 2018;Hussain et al., 2021). Even if the Si is nonessential for the higher plants, it has been observed to be beneficial for the growth and development of several plant species including rice (Song et al., 2014). Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust but generally remains in an undissolved form, which plants are unable to uptake (Souri et al., 2021). The transportation of Si in plants is in the form of silicic acid Si(OH) 4 , which occurs either through active, passive, or rejective pathways (Debona et al., 2017). Among different pathways, the active pathway was found to be facilitated through transporter proteins such as Nod26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) which are aquaporin-type channels, and Lsi2 homologs (Deshmukh et al., 2013;Ratcliffe et al., 2017). An extensive study on around 500 plant species has shown the accumulation of silica in plant shoots may range from 0.1% (in tomato) to 10% (in rice) of plant dry mass (Ma and Takahashi, 2002). Recently Frazao et al. (2020) have shown that Si application brings a decline in C level which results in more N and P absorption, thereby changing C: N: P stoichiometry in sugarcane resulted in increased biomass production. The functionality of Si inside the plant is still the subject of research, which is due to its complexity and multifaceted behavior (Ma and Takahashi, 2002;Deshmukh et al., 2013;Debona et al., 2017;Souri et al., 2021). But, in general, the protective role of Si is considered to be associated with mechanical protection, and its ability to impact the plant gene expression and thus influence the plant defense processes (Chen et al., 2011;Debona et al., 2017;Souri et al., 2021).Despite the fact that silicon (Si) is a non-essential element for the plant, recent research has shown an extraordinary impact of Si, which is unparalleled to any other non-essential element for plants (Tripathi et al., 2017;Khan et al., 2021).

        <p>Photosynthesis is among the most important phenomena, which is responsible for biomass production and overall growth and development in plants. Photosynthesis is also considered to be the stress-sensitive physiological process, where different stress factors adversely impact the photosynthetic machinery and its functionality (Kalaji et al., 2018;Hajihashemi et al., 2018;Rastogi et al., 2020). Silicon has been observed to ameliorate abiotic and biotic stresses in plants by improving photosynthesis at different levels, such as protection of photosynthetic structure, improvement in water use efficiency, improvement in photosynthetic electron transport, protection of photosynthetic machinery from reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene regulations, and by interacting with other physiological processes such as absorption of macro and micronutrients, and phytohormones which also influence photosynthetic activity (Song et al., 2014;Debona et al., 2017;Avila et al., 2020;Hussain et al., 2021). Therefore in this review, a general idea of how the Si influence plant under abiotic and biotic stresses is provided. This review aims to systematically assemble the information and ongoing discussion among the scientific community that whether Si is really effective to regulate photosynthesis under normal and stressful conditions or not? The information provided here will also be useful for a better understanding of the action of Si on photosynthetic machinery. In most cases, Si was observed to be beneficial for plants especially under several stress conditions, indicating its protective role. Here, we have particularly highlighted the effect of Si on photosynthesis under stress conditions.Photosynthesis is among the most important phenomena, which is responsible for biomass production and overall growth and development in plants.

        <p>In recent years, several reviews have been published to discuss the impact and mechanism of action of Si in the alleviation of different abiotic and biotic stress factors (Etesami and Jeong, 2018;Frew et al., 2018;Souri et al., 2021). Whereas, 'Si and plants' in SCOPUS displayed around 13000 results, and approximately 900-1000 articles are published in the year 2020 and 2019 each (https://www.scopus.com, accessed on November 16, 2020), indicating it to be an emerging area of research. Some of the recent research on the effects of Si in ameliorating different abiotic stress factors are discussed here but for more details, the readers may refer to the recent reviews (Etesami and Jeong, 2018;Martin et al., 2020;Souri et al., 2021;Thorne et al., 2020).In recent years, several reviews have been published to discuss the impact and mechanism of action of Si in the alleviation of different abiotic and biotic stress factors (Etesami and Jeong, 2018;Frew et al., 2018;Souri et al., 2021).

        <p>The adverse impact of numerous abiotic stress factors such as salt, drought, shade, temperature (heat and cold), UV-B, and heavy metals have been reported to be alleviated by Si application in several plant species (Song et al., 2014;Sattar et al., 2016;Zargar et al., 2019;Hussain et al., 2021). Numerous studies have suggested the role of Si-mediated alleviation of abiotic stress through nutrient homeostasis, modification in gas exchange, modifications in phytohormones level, osmotic adjustment and higher leaf water content, enhancement in antioxidant content, and upregulation of gene expression related to the suppression of ROS (Tripathi et al., 2017;Meng et al., 2020;Khan et al., 2021).The adverse impact of numerous abiotic stress factors such as salt, drought, shade, temperature (heat and cold), UV-B, and heavy metals have been reported to be alleviated by Si application in several plant species (Song et al., 2014;Sattar et al., 2016;Zargar et al., 2019;Hussain et al., 2021).

        <p>Under drought and salinity, Si was observed to alter the uptake capacity of roots and stomatal aperture that influences the water uptake and water use efficiency, thus the application of Si protects the plants from both of these stresses (Farouk et al., 2020). Different research groups have also suggested that under saline conditions Si-mediated growth of plants might be due to a reduction in sodium (Na + ) uptake and its transportation inside the plant as well as an increase in potassium (K + ) uptake and transportation (Zhu et al., 2019;Meng et al., 2020). The lower Na + , higher K + content, and K + /Na + ratio were also observed to protect the plants from Na + toxicity in Si-treated plants under salinity stress (Meng et al., 2020). Xie et al. (2015) determined the Si effects on the photosynthetic characteristics of maize grown on saline-alkaline soil and observed higher values of the photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and intercellular CO 2 concentration in maize exposed to additional Si. Muneer et al. (2014) reported that the addition of Si increased the photosynthetic pigment content, net photosynthesis, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance and also improved the cytochrome b 6/f and ATP-synthase complex under salt stress. Si treatment increased the tolerance to salinity stress by enhancing the total protein contents, the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase), photosynthetic activity, and macronutrient level (N, P, and K) in maize plants (Moussa and Galad, 2015). Silicon application also increased the drought resistance in rice plants by increasing the chlorophyll content, rate of photosynthesis and transpiration, basal quantum yield (F v /F 0 ), and maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (F v /F m ) (Chen et al., 2011). Silicon addition was observed to alleviate the drought stress in Kentucky bluegrass by increasing the stomatal conductance, leaf water content, relative growth rate, water use efficiency, and rates of photosynthesis and transpiration (Saud et al., 2014). Silicon deposition in the cell wall can make cuticle double layer in the leaf epidermis which reduces cuticular transpiration and also reduces stomatal conductance due to cell wall modification, which results in improving water status of the plant under drought stress (Zhu and Gong, 2014).Under drought and salinity, Si was observed to alter the uptake capacity of roots and stomatal aperture that influences the water uptake and water use efficiency, thus the application of Si protects the plants from both of these stresses (Farouk et al., 2020).

        <p>The other important abiotic stress factors are temperature, UV-B, and heavy metals where Si was found to be beneficial for plants. Silicon gets deposited in cell-wall compartments of xylem and other vascular tissues, which does not allow the compression of cells to occur during excessive transpiration as a result of higher temperature, thus preventing the plants under heat stress (Liang et al., 2007). Recently, the alleviated impact of cold stress through modifications in biochemical properties of leaf apoplast has been observed with Si supplementation in barley (Joudmand and Hajiboland, 2019). Silicon was observed to improve photosynthetic parameters such as electron transport chain (ETC), CO 2 fixation, Rubisco enzyme activity, stomatal closure, and pigment synthesis under freezing temperatures in plants. Silicon accumulates maximally in the leaf tissues of the plants. For this reason, it may provide protection from UV-B radiation and also protect the photosynthetic machinery of plants (Tripathi et al., 2017). Though, Si plays a defensive role towards the combined stress of UV-B and drought by increasing the growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidant parameters (Shen et al., 2010). The application of Si increased the chlorophyll content in wheat and soybean under UV-B radiation (Shen et al., 2010). Positive impacts of Si on chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthetic mechanisms under heavy metal-induced toxicity have also been widely described. Bhat et al. (2019) reported that Si-mediated heavy metal stresses tolerance includes chelation and compartmentalization of metal ions, toxic metals get co-precipitated along with upregulation of antioxidants. This change causes gene regulation of metal-transport-related genes with overall structural alterations in plants. Silicon application enhanced plant growth, gas exchange characteristics (net photosynthetic rate, Pn; stomatal conductance, Gs; transpiration rate, E; water use efficiency, Pn/E) chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, as well as the performance of antioxidant enzymes in cotton plants under cadmium (Cd) stress (Farooq et al., 2013). Manganese was observed to significantly repress the stomatal conductance, net photosynthetic rate, F v /F m , and quantum yield of PSII electron transport, whereas, the application of Si alleviates the negative effects of Mn toxicity in cucumber seedlings (Feng et al., 2009). Silicon and Cd application elevated the levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoid contents in leaves in comparison to Cd application in maize (Malčovská et al., 2014b), wheat (Hussain et al., 2015), cucumber (Feng et al., 2010), and rice plant (Nwugo and Huerta, 2008). Silicon application increased the chlorophyll levels under Aluminum (Al), Chromium (Cr), and Arsenic (As) stress in rice, mung bean, wheat, and barley (Ali et al., 2013;Sanglard et al., 2014;Singh et al., 2011;Tripathi et al., 2015). Hydroponically applied Si improved the gas exchange activities (NPR, SC, TR, and water transportation efficiency), chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents in Cd-stressed plants of cotton, rice, and cucumber (Nwugo and Huerta, 2008;Feng et al., 2010;Farooq et al., 2013). Similarly, Si increases the gas exchange process under Al and Cr toxicity in peanut and barley (Ali et al., 2013;Shen et al., 2014), under Pb toxicity in cotton (Bharwana et al., 2013), As toxicity (Sanglard et al., 2014) and Zn toxicity in rice (Song et al., 2014). Song et al. (2014) showed that the addition of Si alleviated the negative effects of Zn stress on the chloroplast's ultrastructure in rice. In Rice, high-Zn stress disordered the leaf chloroplast and starch granule number and size were decreased but Si (1.5 mM) addition reversed this phenomenon by modulating some photosynthesis-related genes (Fig. 1). Based on high-throughput sequencing, a genetic pathway analysis related to photosynthesis and antenna proteins in response to Si under the stress condition, clearly showed the ameliorating impact of Si under Zn stress in Zn-sensitive rice plants (Song et al., 2014).The other important abiotic stress factors are temperature, UV-B, and heavy metals where Si was found to be beneficial for plants.

        <p>Moreover, Nwugo and Huerta (2011) reported that in rice leaves, Si elevated the Cd tolerance by increasing the water use efficiency, carboxylation efficiency of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO), and light use efficiency. In general, the positive effect of Si on photosynthetic machinery might be due to lower uptake of metals by the plants, which reduces the damage to photosynthetic machinery, or due to activation of the plant defense system and morphological, anatomical, and ultrastructural alterations in the photosynthetic apparatus. The meta-analysis of 145 different experiments by Cooke and Leishman (2016) has shown that Si increases the dry mass of plants, photosynthetic rate, and antioxidant properties of plants exposed to diverse abiotic stresses. It was observed that Si deposition in the leaves of sugarcane, rice, and wheat plants permitted a greater opening angle and induced the maintenance of the vertical position of leaves, reduced the self-shadowing of leaves, and thus improved the overall photosynthetic efficiency under stress conditions (Kusumi et al., 2012;Xie et al., 2015). Thus the different studies performed indicated that the Si improved the photosynthetic processes in various plants exposed to diverse abiotic stress factors, indicating a significant role of photosynthesis in Si mediated alleviation of abiotic stresses in the plants.Moreover, Nwugo and Huerta (2011) reported that in rice leaves, Si elevated the Cd tolerance by increasing the water use efficiency, carboxylation efficiency of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO), and light use efficiency.

        <p>Biotic stress is caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, etc., and damages the crops. Plant-pathogen interaction is a well-coordinated phenomenon involving molecular mechanisms. This deals with the modulation of many genes which play an important role in compatible and incompatible interactions. Plant defense gets mounted and there are many molecules used to initiate this defense response which is called priming agents. Si is one of the priming agents, have proven roles in plant-pathogen interactions, as priming causes a change in phytohormones, defense signaling, etc. involved in Si-mediated resistance responses. The Si has been observed to induce disease resistance against a number of pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) or pests (Debona et al., 2017;Liang et al., 2005;Rasoolizadeh et al., 2018). Kim et al. (2002) found that a thick layer of silica in the epidermal cells prevents or retards pathogen's penetration and increases biotic stress resistance. Abrasiveness in the plant due to silica accumulation increases and subsequently decreases palatability and digestibility for herbivores (Massey and Hartley, 2009). The biotic stress may induce by increasing the excitation higher than the amount necessary for photosynthetic metabolism (Bueno et al., 2017). Silicon can maintain the carbon fixation in the stressed plants and enhance the antioxidant systems which result in the elimination of ROS (Bueno et al., 2017). Silicon can improve plant resistance to biotic stress by induction of defensive mechanism including high accumulation of compounds including phenolics, phytoalexins, and momilactones (Rémus-Borel et al., 2005), and antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, lipoxygenase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (Rahman et al., 2015), which prevents the high ROS accumulation and damage to the photosynthetic system (Nwugo and Huerta, 2008;Muneer et al., 2014;Debona et al., 2017). The attack of Monographella albescens damaged the chlorophyll molecules or chloroplasts of plants, thereby causing a reduction in photosynthesis, while Si supplementation protects the photosynthetic machinery by reducing the lipid peroxidation and ROS production (Aucique-Pérez et al., 2017;Debona et al., 2017;Tatagiba et al., 2015). One symptom of plant diseases with Monographella albescens is the reduction of gas exchange and internal CO 2 due to reduction in its penetration, while Si fertilization positively increased them in the infected plants (Aucique-Pérez et al., 2017;Tatagiba et al., 2015). Similar reports are from the studies including different fungi which damaged the chloroplast that resulting in a reduced rate of photosynthesis (Aucique-Pérez et al., 2017). Thus the application of Si can prevent the impact of biotic stress on plants.Biotic stress is caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, etc., and damages the crops.

The biotic stress may induce by increasing the excitation higher than the amount necessary for photosynthetic metabolism (Bueno et al., 2017). Silicon can maintain the carbon fixation in the stressed plants and enhance the antioxidant systems which result in the elimination of ROS (Bueno et al., 2017). Silicon can improve plant resistance to biotic stress by induction of defensive mechanism including high accumulation of compounds including phenolics, phytoalexins, and momilactones (Rémus-Borel et al., 2005), and antioxidant enzymes such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, lipoxygenase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (Rahman et al., 2015), which prevents the high ROS accumulation and damage to the photosynthetic system (Nwugo and Huerta, 2008;Muneer et al., 2014;Debona et al., 2017). The attack of Monographella albescens damaged the chlorophyll molecules or chloroplasts of plants, thereby causing a reduction in photosynthesis, while Si supplementation protects the photosynthetic machinery by reducing the lipid peroxidation and ROS production (Aucique-Pérez et al., 2017;Debona et al., 2017;Tatagiba et al., 2015). One symptom of plant diseases with Monographella albescens is the reduction of gas exchange and internal CO 2 due to reduction in its penetration, while Si fertilization positively increased them in the infected plants (Aucique-Pérez et al., 2017;Tatagiba et al., 2015). Similar reports are from the studies including different fungi which damaged the chloroplast that resulting in a reduced rate of photosynthesis (Aucique-Pérez et al., 2017). Thus the application of Si can prevent the impact of biotic stress on plants.</p>
        <p>Some of the former studies indicated that Si prevented the damage to thylakoids and chloroplast membrane under stress conditions (Feng et al., 2010;Song et al., 2014). Chlorophyll is a fundamental component of the photosynthesis mechanism, which is responsible for light harvest, distribution, and transformation. Under stress conditions, it is very common to observe a significant decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Feng et al., 2010;Song et al., 2014;Rastogi et al., 2019a). In non-stressed conditions, Si was not observed to influence the chlorophyll concentration (Zhang et al., 2018), but under different stress conditions such as heavy metals or salinity, Si-addition was observed to positively influence the chlorophyll concentration (Feng et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2018), thus helps in the maintenance of normal photosynthetic activity under changing environmental conditions.Some of the former studies indicated that Si prevented the damage to thylakoids and chloroplast membrane under stress conditions (Feng et al., 2010;Song et al., 2014).

        <p>In the last decades, prompt chlorophyll a fluorescence tool has been intensively used for the purpose to observe photosynthetic processes under different environmental stresses (Kalaji et al., 2018;Rastogi et al., 2020). Recently, several studies have been performed where the changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were observed in Si treated plants exposed to different stresses (Feng et al., 2010;Ghassemi-Golezani and Lotfi, 2015;Harizanova and Koleva-Valkova, 2019;Tripathi et al., 2015Tripathi et al., , 2017;;Zhang et al., 2018). Most of the studies clearly observed that the different photosynthetic parameters get improved in Si-treated plants exposed to biotic or abiotic stress factors. From the studies, it can be seen that different PSII factors derived from fluorescence studies perform better with Si application under stress conditions (Table 1). In general, it can be concluded from Table 1, that the numbers of open PSII reaction centers are higher in Si-treated plants, which resulted in increased use of excitation energy in the electron transport chain, thereby improving photochemical efficiency.In the last decades, prompt chlorophyll a fluorescence tool has been intensively used for the purpose to observe photosynthetic processes under different environmental stresses (Kalaji et al., 2018;Rastogi et al., 2020).

        <p>Plants, in general, tend to produce several ROS. The quantity of ROS production increases with biotic and abiotic stresses and it leads to oxidative damage of the cells (Yadav et al., 2012;Kumari et al., 2021;Ahmad et al., 2019;Kohli et al., 2019) and plants, therefore, have mechanisms to combat the oxidative stress. There are enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways to combat this oxidative stress including redoxins (Yadav et al., 2012;Kumari et al., 2021) Photosystems are one of the major sites in plants for ROS production (Pospíšil, 2009), the ROS produce further damage to the photosystems which is repaired by the cellular mechanism. The increase in ROS under stress conditions causes an imbalance which results in damage to photosystems (Nishiyama et al., 2011). The Si application either decreases ROS production or increased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants molecules which ultimately reduces oxidative stress (Miao et al., 2010;Kim et al., 2017). It is proven that the activity of photorespiratory and antioxidant enzymes, as well as the expression of some photorespiratory genes, increased in the Si-improved abiotic stress tolerance (Vaculík et al., 2012;Frew et al., 2017). One symptom of oxidative stress is lipid peroxidation which occurs under abiotic stress due to ROS accumulation (Rastogi et al., 2014;Kaya et al., 2019). The Si-mediated decrease in lipid peroxidation helps to maintain the membrane integrity and decrease the plasma membrane permeability under salt stress, as observed in barley (Liang et al., 2003). Silicon partially offset the negative impacts and increased the tolerance of maize to NaCl stress by increasing the activities of antioxidants such as Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) (Moussa, 2006). Malčovská et al. (Malčovská et al., 2014a) reported that maize seedlings, upon UV-B exposure, generate a significantly higher amount of ROS contents (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), in comparison to Si-treated plants which showed less generation of ROS. This may be due to increased production of phenolic metabolites (total phenols and flavonoids), important for their screening function on Si application under radiation stress, which may contribute to higher UV-B tolerance of maize seedlings and ultimately increased growth and photosynthetic pigment content (chlorophyll and carotenoids).Plants, in general, tend to produce several ROS.

        <p>The protective effects of Si supplementation on photosynthesis have been reported but only a few reports on the molecular mechanism involving gene expression are available. In the presence of Si, the physiological improvement of photosynthetic apparatus and less chlorophyll degradation may be correlated with the modulation of photosynthetic genes. Some of the notable photosynthesis-related genes for which Si-impact was studied are shown in Table 2. Hassan et al. (2021) observed the upregulation of PsbB, PsbD, and PsbH after Si supplementation in wheat plants under heat stress. Where, PsbB codes for CP47 subunit of PSII, PsbD codes for D2 submit of PSII, and PsbH codes for 8 kDa phosphoprotein. Song et al. (2014) also have observed the upregulation of PsbY, PsaH, PetC, PetH, Os09g26810, Os04g38410 after Si supplementation in rice grown under high Zinc stress. PsbY is a polyprotein of PSII whereas, PsaH is the subunit of PSI, thus the upregulation of PsbY and PsaH undoubtedly indicates that Si influences PSI and PSII both in the electron transport chain. The energy transition between PSII and PSI was delayed and damaged the LCH-II complex in PsaH knockout mutant (Lunde et al., 2000). PetC is related to cytochrome whereas, PetH encodes ferredoxin-NADP + oxidoreductase thus is responsible for electron transport, and Si-mediated upregulation of these genes under stress conditions indicated Si involvement in the regulation of electron transport. By upregulating the expression of PetC, Si protected the structural integrity of the chloroplast (Song et al., 2014). Zhang et al. (2018) had observed the upregulation of PetE (responsible for plastocyanin synthesis), PetF (ferredoxin gene), PsbP and PsbQ (PSII related gene, responsible for protein formation in the oxygen-evolving complex), and PsbW and Psb28 (PSII reaction center protein genes) in tomato seedling with Si application under drought. PetE and PetF are important genes responsible for electron transport component, whereas, PsbP, PsbQ, PsbW, and Psb28 are important subunit of PSII and is closely related to water splitting, thus Si helps to maintain the electron transport rate and photochemical efficiency. Overall, the supplementation of Si has induced the vital genes involved in PSI and PSII to protect the photosynthetic efficiency of plants, especially in a stressful environment.The protective effects of Si supplementation on photosynthesis have been reported but only a few reports on the molecular mechanism involving gene expression are available.

        <p>Minerals such as Potassium and Magnesium are essential to plant nutrients that critically contribute to the process of photosynthesis. The mineral nutrients uptake in the plant occurs mainly through the root cells, so any changes in the roots can change the ions status of the plant. As the ions transport commonly happens through the root plasma Hassan et al. (2021) membranes, their uptake is strongly connected to transporters and poreforming proteins like water channels (aquaporins). Silicon can increase mineral nutrient uptake by upregulation of aquaporin genes and root elongation (Hattori et al., 2005;Liu et al., 2015). The mineral nutrients play important roles in photosynthesis including; i) Mg as the central atom in chlorophylls molecules in PSs I and II are essential in light energy absorption, ii) Mn-containing enzyme system in water-splitting reaction and evolution of O2, iii) Fe with important roles in the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and electron transport systems of cytochromes and ferredoxin which can influence N metabolism, iv) Cu involvement in photosynthetic electron transport based on the Cu-containing protein of plastocyanin activity, v) P role in the phosphorylation of ADP to produce ATP, vi) K with the fundamental role in the establishment of H + gradient across the thylakoids membrane for ATP synthesis during photosynthesis (Rengel, 1999). Mineral nutrients also affect some steps in the CO 2 assimilation including i) Na in C4 plants is essential for the conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate, ii) Mg with a major role in the stimulation of carboxylase activity of RuBP, iii) K involvement in increasing stroma pH by controlling H + flux across the thylakoid membrane and subsequently increasing RuPB carboxylase activity and CO 2 fixation rate (Rengel, 1999). One of the outcomes of environmental stress is an imbalance in the essential nutrients in plant tissues, which can adversely affect the photosynthesis process. The increase in the water uptake and transport in Si-fertilized plant can improve the uptake and ion homeostasis followed by enhanced photosynthesis under stress conditions (Feng et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2011;Ghassemi-Golezani and Lotfi, 2015;Sattar et al., 2016;Debona et al., 2017;Rastogi et al., 2019b). For example, the imbalance in essential nutrients is one of the main effects of salinity and heavy metal stress in plants (Adrees et al., 2015). Salinity induces an imbalance in the levels of macronutrients such as Ca, N, S, P, and Mg, and micronutrients like B, Mn, Fe, and Zn (Rios et al., 2017). In the salt-stressed plants, Si-application increased N, P, and Ca concentrations in fava bean (Hellal et al., 2012), P, Ca, and Mg contents in aloe and tomato (Li et al., 2015;Xu et al., 2015), P and Fe contents in canola (Farshidi et al., 2012), and Ca concentration in cucumber (Khoshgoftarmanesh et al., 2014). It is also reported that the Si-fertilization enhanced activity of ATPase and PPase in the plasma membrane which induced an increase in K + and decrease in Na + uptake by roots of salt-stressed plants (Tuna et al., 2008).Minerals such as Potassium and Magnesium are essential to plant nutrients that critically contribute to the process of photosynthesis.

        <p>Phytohormones or plant growth regulators referred to some molecules which directly influence the growth and development process of the plants and are also involved in the plant's response to abiotic, biotic stresses and plant defense (Checker et al., 2018;Sytar et al., 2019). The main known phytohormones are auxin (AUX), gibberellins (GA), cytokinins (CK), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene (ET), while other molecules of strigolactones, brassinosteroids (BR), jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA) and nitric oxide (NO) are also introduced as plant growth regulators (Siddiqui et al., 2018;Sytar et al., 2019). These phytohormones interact with each other when any stress is encountered and well-coordinated signaling resulting in induced response is achieved. Some interactions are antagonistic and some are synergistic which involve many molecules and transcription factors (Checker et al., 2018). The effect of Si fertilization on phytohormones is commonly studied in response to stress conditions. There are some reports about the effect of Si application on endogenous phytohormones under stress conditions, such as in rice under heavy metal stress the reduction of JA, SA, and increase in ABA was observed (Kim et al., 2014a), whereas the reduction of JA in response to plant wounding (Kim et al., 2014b), an increase of GA in response to salinity (Lee et al., 2010), increase in SA, JA, and ET in response to Erysiphe cichoracearum (Fauteux et al., 2006), an increase of JA and ET in tomato exposed to Ralstonia solanacearum (Ghareeb et al., 2011) and reduction of ET in response to the fungus Cochliobolus miyabeanus (Van Bockhaven et al., 2015). There are a few data about the effect of Si on phytohormones in the absence of stress including the increase in CK biosynthesis in Arabidopsis and Sorghum followed by delayed senescence (Markovich et al., 2017). Considering the complex relationship of phytohormones with photosynthesis and photosynthetic activity (Gururani et al., 2015), the impact of Si on photosynthesis can be also influenced through phytohormones.Phytohormones or plant growth regulators referred to some molecules which directly influence the growth and development process of the plants and are also involved in the plant's response to abiotic, biotic stresses and plant defense (Checker et al., 2018;Sytar et al., 2019).

        <p>In plants, complex metabolic activities like photosynthesis are the central process that gets significantly affected under both the biotic and abiotic stress environments. Even the effect of Si on photosynthesis is not so direct, but foregoing discussions make it amply clear that Si influences photosynthesis-related aspects under the stressful environment. Fig. 2 depicts the overall impact of Si on plants going through different biotic and abiotic stress, and its influence on different structural, physiological, and genetic behavior in plants which ultimately influence the photosynthetic processes. Silicon may act as a protective layer and protect cellular membranes such as chloroplast and thylakoid from ROS. Our review indicates that Si has the ability to protect the photosynthetic pigments in plants and reduce damage to the structure of chloroplast and also gets involved in increasing the expression of photosynthesis-related genes. Under the influence of silicon, micro and macronutrients regulate the photosynthetic processes and phytohormones also can ultimately impact the photosynthetic processes. Taking into account the ability of Si to modulate the photosynthetic efficiency under stress (drought, salinity, metal toxicity, and UV-B radiation, etc.) it may be inferred that Si may act in plant defense in other environmental stress conditions. Unfortunately, there is a lack of study related to molecular mechanisms of Si uptake in plants (except some gramineous plant species); hence, genes responsible for Si uptake in other plant species need to be isolated and characterized. Furthermore, most dicot plants cannot accumulate enough Si and Si supplementation is not fruitful for these plants. Consequently, biotechnological interventions are needed to insert the desired genes of Si uptake, so that the plants can accumulate more Si and become tolerant to both biotic and abiotic stresses.In plants, complex metabolic activities like photosynthesis are the central process that gets significantly affected under both the biotic and abiotic stress environments.
