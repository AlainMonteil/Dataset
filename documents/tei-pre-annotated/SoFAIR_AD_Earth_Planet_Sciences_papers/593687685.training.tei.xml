        <p>Currently, the ability to use remotely sensed soil moisture to investigate linkages between the water and energy cycles and for use in data assimilation studies is limited to passive microwave data whose temporal revisit time is 2-3 days or active microwave products with a much longer (&gt;10 days) revisit time. This paper describes a dataset that provides soil moisture retrievals, which are gridded to 36 km, for the upper 5 cm of the soil surface at sparsely sampled 6-hour intervals for +/-38 degrees latitude for 2017-present. Retrievals are derived from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation, which uses GNSS-Reflectometry to obtain L-band reflectivity observations over the Earth's surface. The product was developed by calibrating CYGNSS reflectivity observations to soil moisture retrievals from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Retrievals were validated against observations from 171 in-situ soil moisture probes, with a median unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of 0.049 cm 3 cm -3 (standard deviation = 0.026 cm 3 cm -3 ) and median correlation coefficient of 0.4 (standard deviation = 0.27). For the same stations, the median ubRMSE between SMAP and in-situ observations was 0.045 cm 3 cm -3 (standard deviation = 0.025 cm 3 cm -3 ) and median correlation coefficient was 0.69 (standard deviation = 0.27). The UCAR/CU Soil Moisture Product is thus complementary to SMAP, albeit with a larger random noise component, providing soil moisture retrievals for applications that require faster revisit times than passive microwave remote sensing currently provides.Currently, the ability to use remotely sensed soil moisture to investigate linkages between the water and energy cycles and for use in data assimilation studies is limited to passive microwave data whose temporal revisit time is 2-3 days or active microwave products with a much longer (&gt;10 days) revisit time.

        <p>Near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture data are used for a variety of applications, such as drought monitoring [1][2][3], flood forecasting [4,5], initializing climate models [6], numerical weather prediction [7], quantifying the linkages between the surface and atmospheric boundary layers [8][9][10], optimizing irrigation strategies [11], and predicting infectious disease transmission [12]. All of these applications require soil moisture data at different spatial and temporal scales. Due to its ability to retrieve soil moisture over large parts of the globe, satellite remote sensing is often used to provide these data. Most often, microwave instruments are used due to their ability to see through clouds and penetrate at least some amount of overlying vegetation. However, even the microwave sensor with the fastest revisit time (passive radiometer), is constrained to providing data every 2-3 days [13]. While for many soil moisture applications, such as climate model initialization, a 2-3 day repeat period is more than sufficient, other applications require a higher density of observations. For example, the quantification of soil moisture memory is limited to the time scale of observations [10]. Several ongoing efforts are also using soil moisture as a proxy for other quantities, such as rainfall [14,15] or evaporation [16,17], and having daily or sub-daily data would increase the success of these techniques.Near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture data are used for a variety of applications, such as drought monitoring [1][2][3], flood forecasting [4,5], initializing climate models [6], numerical weather prediction [7], quantifying the linkages between the surface and atmospheric boundary layers [8][9][10], optimizing irrigation strategies [11], and predicting infectious disease transmission [12].

        <p>A constellation of microwave instruments, the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), is currently on orbit over the tropics, and because it is a constellation with numerous satellites, it can provide data more frequently than currently possible using a single instrument alone [18]. Although not designed for soil moisture remote sensing, this paper describes a dataset [19] that has been developed from the CYGNSS constellation that provides soil moisture retrievals for the majority of the tropics (+/-38 degrees latitude) at daily and sub-daily time steps. Here, we describe the algorithm, its assumptions, and validation of the retrievals using in-situ soil moisture observations. In regions where the algorithm performance is acceptable, the CYGNSS soil moisture retrievals could be used to augment existing soil moisture satellite data for the aforementioned applications that require data at a higher temporal resolution.A constellation of microwave instruments, the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), is currently on orbit over the tropics, and because it is a constellation with numerous satellites, it can provide data more frequently than currently possible using a single instrument alone [18].

        <p>The CYGNSS mission was launched in December 2016. A NASA Earth Ventures Mission, CYGNSS consists of eight small satellites that orbit the tropics with an inclination of 35 degrees [18]. CYGNSS was designed to retrieve ocean surface wind speed during hurricane intensification events, and, as such, the receivers and software were optimized for ocean surface remote sensing. Each of the CYGNSS satellites carries with it two downward-looking antennas and a Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) receiver.The CYGNSS mission was launched in December 2016.

        <p>GNSS-R is a form of L-band bistatic radar that utilizes transmitted navigation signals as the signal source. GNSS is an umbrella term that encompasses constellations like the United States' GPS, but also the EU's Galileo, Russia's GLONASS, China's BeiDou, India's IRNSS, and Japan's QZSS. In total, there are over 80 GNSS satellites currently in orbit (32 of which are GPS satellites), with more being planned in the coming years. To date, GNSS-R most commonly utilizes right hand circular polarized (RHCP) L-band signals transmitted from GPS satellites, which upon reflection are predominantly left hand circular polarized (LHCP).GNSS-R is a form of L-band bistatic radar that utilizes transmitted navigation signals as the signal source.

        <p>Because L-band signals are commonly used for near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture remote sensing (e.g., NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) or the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions [13,20]), there is significant interest in quantifying the sensitivity of spaceborne GNSS-R data to changes in soil moisture. There had been evidence of sensitivity during previous GNSS-R flight campaigns (e.g., [21][22][23][24][25]), though the first analyses investigating the sensitivity of spaceborne GNSS-R data to soil moisture were only done after the launch of TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) in 2014. TDS-1 carried the same GNSS-R receiver as is used by CYGNSS, and these preliminary investigations did show that there appeared to be some sensitivity of GNSS-R to soil moisture [26,27]. Due to the fact that TDS-1 only collected GNSS-R data for one out of every eight days, however, developing a full soil moisture retrieval algorithm was not attempted.Because L-band signals are commonly used for near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture remote sensing (e.g., NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) or the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions [13,20]), there is significant interest in quantifying the sensitivity of spaceborne GNSS-R data to changes in soil moisture.

        <p>The sheer amount of data collected by CYGNSS has allowed for an empirical investigation into the sensitivity of spaceborne GNSS-R data to soil moisture. The dataset that we describe here is the result of a modified version of the methodology presented in [28]. The full dataset is available online [19]. The results presented here are the outcome of just one of several ongoing efforts investigating the potential of CYGNSS to retrieve soil moisture. Several of these efforts are also using SMAP retrievals as a reference data set, though differences arise in assumptions regarding gridding, open water masking, and vegetation considerations. For example, [29] assumed that the vast majority of CYGNSS observations have a coarse (&gt;25 km) spatial resolution and spatially averaged the data under this assumption, whereas in the algorithm described here we assume a 3 km spatial resolution. The authors of [30] also used SMAP data for retrieval algorithm development, though also made considerations for changes in vegetation, and [31] incorporated surface roughness data from IceSat-2, neither of which do we do here. Both [29,32] scale their soil moisture retrievals by knowing a priori the maximum and minimum values of soil moisture for a particular region, which we also do not do here. Several other researchers are exploring machine learning techniques for CYGNSS soil moisture retrieval (e.g., [33,34]). Given the differences in validation data sets and time periods used for validation, it is difficult to directly compare the output of algorithms, though most have shown at least moderate success in retrieving soil moisture from CYGNSS.The sheer amount of data collected by CYGNSS has allowed for an empirical investigation into the sensitivity of spaceborne GNSS-R data to soil moisture.

Information contained within the scattered signals can be related to land surface parameters, such as the surface roughness, dielectric constant of the soil, and vegetation properties. The point of reflection on the Earth's surface is determined by the positions of the transmitting and receiving satellites. Because these positions are constantly changing, the reflection points are pseudo-randomly distributed on the Earth's surface (see Figure 2a for examples), which is different than traditional remote-sensing techniques, which collect data in repeatable swaths. This means that, for a given point of the Earth's surface, observations could be recorded one hour apart, and then there could be no observations for the next several hours, for example [35]. Observations are recorded at all times of day, again, unlike traditional remote-sensing techniques, which tend to observe a particular location at a particular time of day. The pseudo-random distribution of observations, over time, aggregate such that complete maps of the reflected signal can be made (Figure 2b). A GNSS-R receiver (Rx) onboard a low-Earth-orbiting satellite, with a downward-looking antenna, records this signal. The point on the Earth's surface where the signal reflects depends upon the positions of the transmitting and receiving satellites. The roughness of the surface at the reflection point determines the spatial resolution of the signal, with rougher surfaces producing larger spatial footprints. Nearly always, the receiver integrates the reflected signal over a period of time, which elongates the spatial footprint in the along-track direction.Unlike monostatic radar, which measures backscatter, GNSS-R measures the forward-scattered signal, which has reflected off of the surface of the Earth and back into space.

The pseudo-random distribution of observations, over time, aggregate such that complete maps of the reflected signal can be made (Figure 2b). The spatial resolution of the reflecting signal depends on the roughness of the surface at and near the reflection point [36]. Here, roughness includes possible contributions from many factors and not just the micro-scale roughness of the soil, such as roughness introduced from vegetation canopies, wind-roughened water, and macro-scale roughness from topography. If the surface is relatively rough, then the reflected signal is incoherent and comes from an area called the "glistening zone," which is on the order of several kilometers (~25 km in the case of the ocean surface), though recent research is beginning to show that where incoherent scattering originates from over the land surface is highly dependent on the local topography and may not be definable with a simple 25-km radius [37]. If the surface is relatively smooth, then the reflected signal is coherent and comes from an area defined by the first Fresnel zone. For a low-Earth-orbiting GNSS-R satellite, this area is on the order of 0.5 kilometers, though this also depends on incidence angle (0.33 km at 0 deg incidence, 1.3 km at 60 deg incidence) [38]. In practical terms, determining whether the reflecting surface is smooth enough to produce a coherent reflection is challenging, as surface roughness is an extremely difficult parameter to measure. Existing measurements show that surface roughness tends to be on the order of 2-3 cm [39][40][41], though surface roughness likely varies considerably on scales as large as the first Fresnel zone. There are also likely complications from macro-scale surface roughness due to topographic variations that are not well understood. Modelling efforts are beginning to shed light into the role of topography in GNSS-R signal scattering (e.g. [42,43]), with some studies showing that the sensitivity of the GNSS-R signal to soil moisture is relatively unaffected by complex topography [42].The point of reflection on the Earth's surface is determined by the positions of the transmitting and receiving satellites.

        <p>Due to the fact that CYGNSS was designed to be an ocean sensor, where the reflected signal is relatively weak, the processing software integrates the signal over a period of 1 second for each "observation."

        <p>The reflected GNSS signal is recorded by the receiver in the form of what is called a delay-Doppler map (DDM). A DDM is created by cross-correlating the received signal with a locally generated replica that has been modified considering different path delays (resulting from the path distance between the transmitter, reflecting surface, and receiver, as shown in Figure 1) and Doppler shifts (resulting from the relative motions of the transmitter, reflecting surface, and the receiver). Two examples of DDMs are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a is an example of a DDM recorded by CYGNSS over the land surface, and Figure 3b is an example of a DDM recorded over the ocean surface.

The absence of a horseshoe shape in Figure 3a indicates that the reflection is mostly coherent, and comes from a smaller, smoother area.

        <p>Using SMAP data for calibration of course comes with many drawbacks, the major one being that SMAP soil moisture retrievals are not soil moisture observations and have their own error and uncertainties. One must be careful when using CYGNSS data in areas where it is known that SMAP performs poorly. In addition, SMAP's 40 km spatial resolution is likely coarser than that of CYGNSS. Intelligent upscaling of CYGNSS data to the 36-km EASE-2 grid that SMAP uses is necessary. If the resolution of CYGNSS is smaller than 36 km, then this effectively degrades the CYGNSS data and does not utilize it to its full potential. Despite the drawbacks associated with calibrating CYGNSS data with SMAP retrievals, SMAP data are considered to be one of, if not the, most accurate of the existing soil moisture products [45,46].Using SMAP data for calibration of course comes with many drawbacks, the major one being that SMAP soil moisture retrievals are not soil moisture observations and have their own error and uncertainties.

        <p>Incidence angle is also expected to affect a coherent reflection, though this effect is only significant when the incidence angle is above 40 or 50 degrees. We correct for incidence angle in a similar way as in [29] by modelling how the effective surface reflectivity should change as a function of incidence angle, using established relationships (e.g., [47]). We call Γ rl observations that have been corrected for incidence angle "P r,eff ," which stands for the effective surface reflectivity.Incidence angle is also expected to affect a coherent reflection, though this effect is only significant when the incidence angle is above 40 or 50 degrees.

            <rs type="software">CYGNSS</rs> was not optimized for remote sensing of the land surface, we remove observations that are flagged with standard quality measures as well as use empirical quality control that we have found to increase the effectiveness of our algorithm. Standard quality flags that we use are the following: "S-band transmitter powered up," "spacecraft attitude error," "black body DDM," "DDM is a test pattern," "direct signal in DDM," and "low confidence in the GPS EIRP estimate." Although it has been recommended that observations from the GPS Block IIF satellites be removed due to larger variations in GPS transmit power and consequently larger uncertainties in P r [48], we keep these observations, as removing them reduces data volume by more than 30%.

        <p>The removal of specular reflection points that are affected by open water is a critical step before retrieving soil moisture. Even small water bodies ~25 m wide can significantly affect P r,eff (e.g., Figure 1 from [28]). Our algorithm uses the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) dataset described in [49], which is a 30-m water mask derived from Landsat data. Because it is derived from optical data, it cannot sense water beneath vegetation, though the L-band CYGNSS data is likely sensitive to some amount of water underneath a vegetation canopy. Additionally, because the GSWE is quasi-static in that it describes open water occurrence or when water occurs seasonally, it is not concurrent with the CYGNSS observations. The open water masking effort is thus imperfect, though we have found that it successfully removes a large amount of CYGNSS observations that are affected by open water.The removal of specular reflection points that are affected by open water is a critical step before retrieving soil moisture.

        <p>The current algorithm removes open water using the "seasonality" data product provided by the GSWE. This product indicates how many months out of a year a pixel is inundated (0-12). For our purposes, we make this product binary by considering any value greater than 1 to be flagged as open water, and anything below this not to be open water. This is done because occasionally permanent water bodies are seasonally covered by vegetation, which makes the GSWE represent them as less than 12 (permanent). For each specular reflection point, we find the amount of water within a 7 × 7 km region surrounding the point. This is a simplification of the actual footprint, but it is computationally more efficient than rotating axes to form actual ellipses, which themselves are simplifications and not well quantified. If the amount of water in the 7 × 7 km region exceeds 1%, we remove that CYGNSS observation from consideration. Changing these thresholds or the size of the 7 × 7 km region does change the results, though never uniformly increasing or decreasing error across regions. It is possible that future versions of the soil moisture product will use a different open water masking procedure or incorporate CYGNSS coherence detectors, such as that described in [37], to aid in the detection of small water bodies.The current algorithm removes open water using the "seasonality" data product provided by the GSWE.

        <p>We now describe how P r,eff is transformed into soil moisture, using SMAP soil moisture retrievals to calibrate CYGNSS observations. Our calibration period was chosen to be 17 March 2017-1 October 2018. This is an extended period beyond what was shown in [28]. In our calibration, we use all SMAP retrievals regardless of SMAP quality flags to allow for the retrieval of soil moisture from CYGNSS for the entirety of CYGNSS' observational area. Of course, users should be cautious to use CYGNSS soil moisture retrievals from regions regularly flagged by SMAP, such as the dense forests of South America and Africa, which are indicated in the CYGNSS quality flags.We now describe how P r,eff is transformed into soil moisture, using SMAP soil moisture retrievals to calibrate CYGNSS observations.

Before we can describe this in more detail, however, we must explain what "a given location" means in this context.The algorithm is based on the assumption that P r,eff is linearly related to SMAP soil moisture.

        <p>In Section 1.2, we described how the smallest theoretical (no roughness) spatial footprint of CYGNSS over land is approximately 7 × 0.5 km, or 3.5 × 0.5 km for data recorded after mid-2019. What the actual spatial resolution is over land is a matter of debate within the GNSS-R community, though our own analysis of how P r,eff varies with small landcover or topographic features indicates to us that the effective footprint is likely only a few km, much smaller than SMAP's 40 km resolution [28]. If, for every SMAP observation, the CYGNSS observations completely sampled the 36-km EASE-2 grid cell used by SMAP, then a simple averaging could be used to aggregate CYGNSS observations to match with the SMAP retrieval. However, this is not the case. For every SMAP observation, there will likely be several CYGNSS observations within the grid cell, though not enough to completely sample the grid cell, if the spatial footprint is small (&lt; 10 km). In this case, simple averaging will lead to variations in the day-to-day signal due to differential sampling of landcover types and topography within the SMAP pixel, which could be mistaken for variations in soil moisture.In Section 1.2, we described how the smallest theoretical (no roughness) spatial footprint of CYGNSS over land is approximately 7 × 0.5 km, or 3.5 × 0.5 km for data recorded after mid-2019.

        <p>Within each subcell, we calculate the linear regression between SMAP soil moisture and Pr,eff match-ups (occurring on the same calendar day), after having removed the mean values of both SMAP soil moisture and Pr,eff in that subcell. The slope of the linear regression is 𝛽 , which is conceptualized in Figure 4b. The correlation coefficients for these relationships are shown in Figure 6. 𝛽 varies spatially (Figure 7). Some of the spatial variability is likely real, and it could be the result of spatial variations in topography or landcover. Some of it, however, is likely the result of the fact that some arid regions do not have enough soil moisture variability throughout the year in order to adequately calculate 𝛽. In these regions, 𝛽 is artificially low because any noise in the CYGNSS observations will significantly affect the linear regression [28].Within each subcell, we calculate the linear regression between SMAP soil moisture and Pr,eff match-ups (occurring on the same calendar day), after having removed the mean values of both SMAP soil moisture and Pr,eff in that subcell.

        <p>We calculated the median unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) between daily averaged CYGNSS retrievals and in-situ observations for each individual station (Table A1) as well as aggregated by network (Table 1). Note that here we use ubRMSE, whereas before we used ubRMSD to compare SMAP and CYGNSS retrievals. Though we calculated them the same way, we use ubRMSE here to indicate that this is a validation exercise, whereas the comparison between SMAP and CYGNSS was only for the purpose of showing where the two products are dissimilar from one another. For context, we also calculated the ubRMSE between SMAP retrievals and in-situ observations for the same time period. These values are also contained in Tables 1 andA1. Overall, the median ubRMSE between CYGNSS and in situ (0.049 cm 3 cm -3 ) and SMAP and in situ (0.045 cm 3 cm -3 ) were very similar, given that the standard deviations of each were ~0.025 cm 3 cm -3 . Similar ubRMSEs are expected since that CYGNSS was calibrated from SMAP retrievals. A map of all in-situ stations used in this validation exercise along with their respective ubRMSE values is shown in Figure 9. Note that there is a wide range of ubRMSE values, depending on the site and network. In particular, SNOTEL sites performed poorly (mean ubRMSE ~= 0.09 cm 3 cm -3 ). SNOTEL sites tend to be in mountainous areas with surrounding trees. P r,e f f in these regions tends to be low, which is an indicator that either topographic roughness or dense vegetation is significantly affecting the reflected signal. We caution users who are interested in using the CYGNSS retrievals in such areas, given the high validation ubRMSE at the in-situ sites. The quality flags described in the last section delineate where these effects are likely to be at play. Table A1 also includes other validation metrics, such as the correlation coefficient (r) between CYGNSS and in-situ sites and the mean bias between in-situ observations and SMAP retrievals, which by extension is also the bias between in-situ observations and CYGNSS retrievals. The median correlation coefficient across sites is somewhat low (r = 0.4) but with a large standard deviation (0.27). Figure 10a shows a histogram of the correlation coefficient (r) between CYGNSS and in-situ observations, with that from SMAP shown for context. Compared to SMAP, CYGNSS has a wider distribution of correlation coefficients, with a lower median value (Table 1). Similar to what was discussed in relation to the correlation between CYGNSS effective reflectivity and SMAP soil moisture, areas with low or no soil moisture variation during the validation time period often results in a low correlation coefficient, as any effects due to random noise are amplified when there is no soil moisture variation. CYGNSS retrievals are expected to have more noise than SMAP retrievals, given the aforementioned imperfections in signal calibration and lack of full grid cell coverage. Figure 10b shows that the distribution of r values does change significantly when only in-situ sites with moderate or large soil moisture variability are considered, which helps mask the effect of noise. In addition to the correlation coefficient, the median absolute bias between SMAP and in-situ observations, which will also be the bias between CYGNSS and in-situ, is 0.05 cm 3 cm -3 . This dry bias is a known issue in the SMAP retrievals [56].

This dry bias is a known issue in the SMAP retrievals [56]. Validating a satellite remote-sensing product based off of point measurements, as we have done here, is an imperfect exercise, as the individual soil moisture probe observations may not be representative of the larger areal average. The validation effort conducted by SMAP, for example, averaged in-situ observations from many probes spread out over a large area, for each of their validation sites [46]. The sites that comprise OzNet do indeed contain multiple probes at each site, though there are only two sites with data within the calibration time period (see Table A1). In this case, we used the mean of all probe measurements within one site to calculate the ubRMSE. CYGNSS soil moisture retrievals did agree better with the in-situ observations from these sites (ubRMSE = 0.043 cm 3 cm -3 ) than they did from the point-based observations. Examples of CYGNSS soil moisture time series that agree well with in-situ observations are shown in Figure 11. These sites show that CYGNSS has the ability to retrieve both low and high soil moisture contents. An example of the increased temporal resolution of daily averaged CYGNSS retrievals with respect to SMAP is shown in Figure 12. In this example, the increased resolution of CYGNSS results in the observation of increased soil moisture due to two precipitation events in late June and early July of 2018, which are missed by SMAP. Table A1 shows how many daily averaged Validating a satellite remote-sensing product based off of point measurements, as we have done here, is an imperfect exercise, as the individual soil moisture probe observations may not be representative of the larger areal average. The validation effort conducted by SMAP, for example, averaged in-situ observations from many probes spread out over a large area, for each of their validation sites [46]. The sites that comprise OzNet do indeed contain multiple probes at each site, though there are only two sites with data within the calibration time period (see Table A1). In this case, we used the mean of all probe measurements within one site to calculate the ubRMSE.

Table A1 shows how many daily averaged CYGNSS soil moisture retrievals were available during the validation time period, which can be compared to the number of SMAP retrievals for the same time period. On average CYGNSS soil moisture retrievals increase the temporal revisit time by 63.4%. For each in-situ site, we calculated the number of rain events during the validation period, which we defined as an increase in the daily averaged soil moisture greater than 0.02 cm 3 cm -3 . We then calculated the number of the rainy days that had CYGNSS observations and the number that had SMAP observations. From this, we could calculate the percentage of rain events "observed" by both CYGNSS and SMAP and found that CYGNSS observed a median of 87% of the rain events, and SMAP observed a median of 43% (distributions shown in Figure 13). At sites with acceptable CYGNSS performance, CYGNSS would be able to provide more information about soil drying and wetting than SMAP currently is able to.

A rain event was defined as the daily averaged soil moisture value increasing by more than 0.02 cm 3 cm -3 with respect to the previous day's value.We calculated the median unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) between daily averaged CYGNSS retrievals and in-situ observations for each individual station (Table A1) as well as aggregated by network (Table 1). Note that here we use ubRMSE, whereas before we used ubRMSD to compare SMAP and CYGNSS retrievals. Though we calculated them the same way, we use ubRMSE here to indicate that this is a validation exercise, whereas the comparison between SMAP and CYGNSS was only for the purpose of showing where the two products are dissimilar from one another. For context, we also calculated the ubRMSE between SMAP retrievals and in-situ observations for the same time period. These values are also contained in Tables 1 andA1. Overall, the median ubRMSE between CYGNSS and in situ (0.049 cm 3 cm -3 ) and SMAP and in situ (0.045 cm 3 cm -3 ) were very similar, given that the standard deviations of each were ~0.025 cm 3 cm -3 . Similar ubRMSEs are expected since that CYGNSS was calibrated from SMAP retrievals. A map of all in-situ stations used in this validation exercise along with their respective ubRMSE values is shown in Figure 9. Note that there is a wide range of ubRMSE values, depending on the site and network. In particular, SNOTEL sites performed poorly (mean ubRMSE ~= 0.09 cm 3 cm -3 ). SNOTEL sites tend to be in mountainous areas with surrounding trees. P r,e f f in these regions tends to be low, which is an indicator that either topographic roughness or dense vegetation is significantly affecting the reflected signal. We caution users who are interested in using the CYGNSS retrievals in such areas, given the high validation ubRMSE at the in-situ sites. The quality flags described in the last section delineate where these effects are likely to be at play. Table A1 also includes other validation metrics, such as the correlation coefficient (r) between CYGNSS and in-situ sites and the mean bias between in-situ observations and SMAP retrievals, which by extension is also the bias between in-situ observations and CYGNSS retrievals. The median correlation coefficient across sites is somewhat low (r = 0.4) but with a large standard deviation (0.27). Figure 10a shows a histogram of the correlation coefficient (r) between CYGNSS and in-situ observations, with that from SMAP shown for context. Compared to SMAP, CYGNSS has a wider distribution of correlation coefficients, with a lower median value (Table 1). Similar to what was discussed in relation to the correlation between CYGNSS effective reflectivity and SMAP soil moisture, areas with low or no soil moisture variation during the validation time period often results in a low correlation coefficient, as any effects due to random noise are amplified when there is no soil moisture variation. CYGNSS retrievals are expected to have more noise than SMAP retrievals, given the aforementioned imperfections in signal calibration and lack of full grid cell coverage. Figure 10b shows that the distribution of r values does change significantly when only in-situ sites with moderate or large soil moisture variability are considered, which helps mask the effect of noise. In addition to the correlation coefficient, the median absolute bias between SMAP and in-situ observations, which will also be the bias between CYGNSS and in-situ, is 0.05 cm 3 cm -3 . This dry bias is a known issue in the SMAP retrievals [56].

Validation of the product at 171 in-situ soil moisture stations resulted in a median ubRMSE of 0.049 cm 3 cm -3 . This product can be used by hydrologists who are interested in soil moisture data at a higher temporal resolution than currently available using other products. As was shown in Figures 12 and13, CYGNSS can observe changes in soil moisture due to precipitation events that may be too quick for the SMAP overpass period. The quantification of soil moisture memory, observation of moisture conditions giving rise to flooding, and the inverse estimation of precipitation using soil moisture time series all require soil moisture data on short time scales, and a daily soil moisture product may be able to provide more complete information on soil moisture dynamics at needed time scales.This paper described the UCAR/CU CYGNSS Soil Moisture Product [19], which uses spaceborne GNSS-R reflections, calibrated to SMAP soil moisture, to produce soil moisture retrievals.
