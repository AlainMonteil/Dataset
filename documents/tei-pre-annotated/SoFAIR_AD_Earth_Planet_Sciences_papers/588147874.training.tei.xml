        <p>When studying instability of weakly nonparallel flows, it is often desirable to convert temporal growth rates of unstable modes, which can readily be computed, to physically more relevant spatial growth rates. This has been performed by using the well-known Gaster's transformation for primary instability and Herbert's transformation for the secondary instability of a saturated primary mode. The issue of temporal-spatial transformation is revisited in the present paper to clarify/rectify the ambiguity/misunderstanding that appear to exist in the literature. A temporal mode and its spatial counterpart may be related by sharing either the real frequency or wavenumber, and the respective transformations between their growth rates are obtained by a simpler consistent derivation than the original one. These transformations, which consist of first-and second-order versions, are valid under conditions less restrictive than those for Gaster's and Herbert's transformations, and reduce to the latter under additional conditions, which are not always satisfied in practice. The transformations are applied to inviscid Rayleigh instability of a mixing layer and a jet, secondary instability of a streaky flow as well as general detuned secondary instability (including subharmonic and fundamental resonances) of primary Mack modes in a supersonic boundary layer. Comparison of the transformed growth rates with the directly calculated spatial growth rates shows that the transformations derived in this paper outperform Gaster's and Herbert's transformations consistently. The first-order transformation is accurate when the growth rates are small or moderate, while the second-order transformations are sufficiently accurate across the entire instability bands, and thus stands as a useful tool for obtaining spatial instability characteristics via temporal stability analysis.</p>
        <p>Hydrodynamic stability is concerned with whether and how a flow becomes unstable. Of primary interest are two-dimensional parallel and weakly nonparallel flows, which † Email address for correspondence: shookware@tju.edu.cn ‡ Email address for correspondence: x.wu@ic.ac.uk include boundary layers and free shear layers. Their instability may be studied, as a first step, by considering the development of small-amplitude disturbances, for which the governing equations of the disturbances can be linearized. A disturbance φ(x, y, z, t) takes the travelling-wave or normal-mode form, φ(x, y, z, t) = φ(y; x)e i(αx+βz-ωt) + c.c., in a usual Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, z), where φ stands for the shape function, ω the frequency, and α and β represent the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers, respectively. For an exactly parallel flow, φ is a function of y only, but for a weakly nonparallel flow φ depends also on x, with the dependence being parametric under the local-parallel-flow approximation. The homogeneous governing equations and boundary conditions for φ form an eigenvalue problem, which describes a dispersion relation,</p>
        <p>where the parametric dependence on x arises for a weakly nonparallel flow. In the following, such parametric dependence will not be indicated for brevity as it has no bearing on the topics under investigation. As the base flow is homogenous in the spanwise direction, we may take β to be real but one of α and ω must be complex valued. When α is real, ω is then found as an eigenvalue, and it usually takes a complex value with its image part ω i representing the rate of growth with time; this is referred to as temporal stability analysis. When ω is taken to be real, α is obtained as an eigenvalue, and is usually complex. Then -α i quantifies the growth rate in space (the streamwise direction), and this is called spatial stability analysis.</p>
        <p>Temporal growth rates can readily be obtained by solving a linear eigenvalue problem using a range of algorithms, while spatial growth rates have to be found by solving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, which presents a computational task much more challenging. From the physical viewpoint, it is the spatial growth that describes instability phenomena and is directly observed or measured. Gaster (1962) showed that the temporal characteristics can be converted to the spatial ones by a transformation, -α i = ω i /c g,r , (1.2) where c g,r = ∂ω r /∂α r is the real part of the group velocity. The relation (1.2) has become known as Gaster's transformation. Gaster (1962) derived it assuming that the growth rate is small (|ω i | ≪ 1), but also making the estimate ∂ω i /∂α r = O(ω i ), which he apparently took as following from |ω i | ≪ 1 and under which the frequencies/wavenumbers of the spatial and temporal modes having the same wavenumer/frequency differ by O(ω 2 i ) and were taken to be equal. As c g,r can be calculated in the temporal stability analysis along with ω, transformation (1.2) has often been used to provide a quick estimate for spatial growth rates, and its accuracy proved to be adequate for viscous instability. Nayfeh &amp; Padhye (1979) considered the relation between temporal and spatial growth using a standard multiple-scale method to derive an equation for the spatially and temporally modulated amplitude function. From the amplitude equation, they derived a transformation,</p>
        <p>(1.3) where ℜ{•} indicates the real part of a complex number; herein c g was expressed in terms of the base-flow profile, the eigenfunction and its adjoint, but based on the wellknown result in wave theory c g was recognised to be the complex group velocity dω/dα. The formula (1.3) is pertinent to temporal and spatial modes having the same frequency. When it was applied to T-S mode in Blasius boundary layer, the converted spatial growth rates are virtually identical to those obtained using Gaster's original transformation (1.2). This is because the imaginary part of c g , dω i /dα, which is neglected in the latter, turned out to be very small. The condition for the validity of transformations (1.2) and (1.3) was discussed by Peng &amp; Williams (1987), who suggested that the condition |α i /α r | ≪ 1 is required, which essentially restricts the applicability of (1.2) and (1.3) to nearly neutral modes. They implemented the transformations for inviscid Rayleigh instability of a mixing layer and a planar jet, and demonstrate that the errors increase with |α i /α r |. However, the condition |α i /α r | ≪ 1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for (1.2), and is actually unnecessary for (1.3), as we will show later. Possible scenarios which make the transformations invalid was discussed by Brevdo (1992), and one of these is the possible presence of branch points in the dispersion relation.</p>
        <p>Gaster's transformation, originally proposed for primary instability of flows sheared primarily in one direction, has also been used for secondary instabilities. An important case is where the base flow varies substantially in both the normal and spanwise directions, often due to presence of streaks or longitudinal vortices. Li &amp; Malik (1995) computed the temporal growth rates for secondary instability of Görtler vortices, and transformed them to the spatial counterparts through the real group velocity. Similar calculations and conversions were performed by Ricco et al. (2011) and Xu et al. (2017) for streaks and Görtler vortices induced by free-stream vortical disturbances, using the real and complex group velocities respectively, and the transformed spatial growth rates were found to be in good agreement with the spatial stability solutions.</p>
        <p>Another type of secondary instability is that of a two-dimensional primary mode, such as a Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) wave in an incompressible boundary layer, or a Mack mode in a supersonic boundary layer. Once a primary mode reaches a threshold amplitude, a new base flow consisting of the unperturbed boundary layer and the superimposed primary mode may be susceptible to instability with respect to threedimensional disturbances. Such secondary instability has been studied by Herbert (1984) and Herbert et al. (1987). Particular attention has focused on the fundamental and subharmonic resonances or modes, while the general case is the detuned parametric resonance. The conversion between temporal and spatial growth rates of secondary instability is in principle the same as for a primary instability, but must be implemented with care. It is necessary to translate the transformations for primary instability to a form pertinent to the specific representation of secondary modes, or alternatively re-derive the formulae to be used. Curiously, this has not been undertaken adequately. Herbert (1984) proposed a simple transformation that links temporal and spatial growth rates through the phase velocity of the primary mode. This transformation, which is sometimes referred to as Herbert's transformation, was applied to subharmonic secondary instability of the dominant T-S wave in Blasius boundary layer (Herbert 1988). The converted spatial growth was found to agree well with the experimental data of Kachanov &amp; Levchenko (1984). Satisfactory accuracy was also observed when this transformation was applied to subharmonic secondary instability of Mack modes in supersonic boundary layers (Xu et al. 2020). However, the transformation failed for secondary instability of fundamental resonance form. Bertolotti (1985) undertook to establish the relations between temporal and spatial growths of secondary instability. Application of the connection formulae derived to subharmonic secondary mode showed that the converted spatial growth rates were in fair agreement with the directly computed ones, and moderately more accurate than those given by Herbert's transformation. Unfortunately, the connection formulae require the data that has to be supplied by solving a spatial instability problem. Malik et al. (1999) and Koch et al. (2000) extended Gaster's derivation to secondary instability of crossflow vortices arising in three-dimensional boundary layers. The resulting trans- formation, which involves the real group velocity of secondary modes, turned out to be highly accurate (Koch et al. 2000;Li &amp; Choudhari 2011) for stationary vortices, but it does not seem to have been implemented for travelling-wave vortices.</p>
        <p>In summary, there appear to be ambiguities and perhaps misconceptions about the conditions for the validity of existing temporal-spatial transformations despite their wide and often successful applications. Their accuracy has neither been fully established nor proved to be adequate for flows such as free shear layers, where instabilities exhibit stronger growth. Specifically for the secondary instability, the reason as to why Herbert's transformation worked for subharmonic resonance but failed for fundamental resonance remains unexplained, and a reliable and accurate transformation for general detuned resonance is not available.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the present paper is to clarify/rectify ambiguities/misconceptions about the validity and accuracy of existing temporal-spatial transformations. Consistent first-order transformations for primary and secondary instabilities will be derived and shown to be valid under conditions less restrictive than those for Gaster's and Herbert's transformations. Furthermore, we will propose and validate improved second-order transformations that involve only solving temporal instability problems and are sufficiently accurate in the entire band of the stability, primary or secondary.</p>
        <p>Transformations between temporal and spatial growth rates can be derived from the dispersion relation. Mathematically, both α and ω can be allowed to take complex values, and the dispersion (1.1) then defines an analytic function, ω = ω(α), or mapping between the complex α-and ω-planes. As is shown in Figure 1, unstable temporal modes correspond to the mapping from an interval on the real α-axis onto a curve (arc) on the upper ω-plane: α(T ) → ω(T ), while unstable spatial modes correspond to the mapping from an interval on the real ω-axis onto a curve (arc) on the lower α-plane: ω(S) → α(S), where the arguments 'T ' and 'S' signify a temporal mode (α i (T ) = 0) and spatial mode (ω r (S) = 0) respectively, with the subscripts 'r' and 'i' denoting the real and imaginary parts of a complex quantity, respectively. The arcs appear rather 'shallow' in their respective complex planes. This is because for most shear flows, over the majority of the instability band ω i and -α i are appreciably smaller than the respective ranges of ω r and α r , by one order of magnitude for viscous instability, and by a factor of 2 to 5 for inviscid Rayleigh instability. It is assumed that each eigenmode corresponds to a simple root of the dispersion relation so that the mapping is one-to-one. For a double root, dω/dα = 0, and the transformation in this degenerated case is not discussed here.</p>
        <p>2.1. Temporal-spatial transformation for primary instability and secondary instability of streaky flows Gaster (1962) derived his transformation by integrating the Cauchy-Riemann relations with respect to α i , from α(T ) = (α r , 0) to α(S) = (α r , α i ), which leads to the transformation between the temporal and spatial modes having the same wavenumber α r . The derivation of the transformation between the modes having the same frequency is more involved. Instead of integrating the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we will derive the required transformations simply by Taylor expansion of the complex function ω(α), with the Cauchy-Riemann relations being used in the course of simplifying the results. As it will transpire, this procedure has the advantage that the conditions for the validity and accuracy of the resulting transformations will become rather evident.</p>
        <p>In deriving the transformations, it is important for practical applications to ensure that the spatial characteristics are to be given completely by temporal stability analysis.</p>
        <p>As was remarked above, a temporal mode has α(T ) real and ω(T ) complex, while a corresponding spatial mode has ω(S) real but α(S) complex. On putting α = α(S) and ω(S) = ω(α(S)), the first-order Taylor expansion of ω = ω(α) about α(T ) gives</p>
        <p>from which it follows that</p>
        <p>where we have put ω(T ) = ω(α(T )).</p>
        <p>There are two ways to link a temporal mode to a spatial one. The first and more natural way is that they have the same real frequency, ω(S) = ω r (T ), in which case</p>
        <p>where</p>
        <p>is the complex group velocity. It follows that there is a difference in both the real and imaginary parts of the wavenumbers of the two modes, and the present transformation (2.3) is more general than Gaster's transformation but similar to that in Nayfeh &amp; Padhye (1979), who derived the result through introducing an amplitude function modulated slowly on long time and length scales. In numerical calculations, α is taken to be real, and c g can easily be calculated by solving the temporal stability problem for α and α + ∆α with ∆α ≪ 1 to find ω(α) and ω(α + ∆α), which are used in a finite-difference approximation to give c g ≈ ω(α + ∆α) -ω(α) /∆α. This is more convenient than evaluating c g by calculating the eigenfunction, its adjoint and then their inner product, as was done in Nayfeh &amp; Padhye (1979). As will be shown below, another advantage of the present methodology is that it provides the validity condition for the transformation, and furthermore it can easily be expanded to obtain a transformation of higher-accuracy; neither of these seems possible in the amplitude-equation approach of Nayfeh &amp; Padhye (1979).</p>
        <p>The two modes may alternatively be related by having a common real wavenumer, α r (S) = α(T ), use of which in (2.2) gives iα i (S) = ω(S) -ω r (T ) -iω i (T ) dω dα α(T ) .</p>
        <p>(2.5)</p>
        <p>Separation of the real and imaginary parts yields</p>
        <p>Interestingly, transformation (2.6) for the growth rate turns out to be the same as Gaster's transformation (1.2) since the connection is through the real group velocity c g,r = dω r / dα. However, it should be noted that ω(S) = ω r (T ), and this frequency correction needs to be accounted for when comparison is made with the directly calculated spatial growth rate, that is, the latter must be computed for the corrected ω(S) rather than ω(T ). The correction is negligible only under additional condition (2.7). Clearly, relating the modes via a common real frequency is a natural choice and preferred. We note that Taylor expansion was employed by (Náraigh &amp; Spelt 2013) to deduce spatialtemporal (especially absolute) instability properties from the dispersion of temporal stability, and they obtained the transformation (2.6) connecting spatial and temporal modes with the same wavenumber, but they did not make the key observation about connecting two modes through a common frequency.</p>
        <p>We now discuss the validity and accuracy of the transformations. Of importance is the analyticity of the dispersion relation. It guarantees, inter alia, that the Taylor expansion of ω = ω(α), which leads to the results, is convergent when α(T ) and α(S) are within the region of analyticity, that is, the resulting series has a finite radius of convergence, which is given by the distance of α(T ) to the nearest singularity. Furthermore, the mapping is invertible (and conformal) provided that the complex group velocity c g = dω/dα = 0. When c g = 0 for ω (and α) in the region bounded by the interval and the arc on the complex ω (and α) plane, absolute instability arises (Huerre &amp; Monkewitz (1985)), in which case the temporal-to-spatial conversion becomes unnecessary because spatial evolution, a notion associated with convective instability is physically irrelevant; mathematically the conversion remains valid and can still be performed for any α(T ) provided that the disc in the complex α-plane, |α -α(T )| |α(S) -α(T )|, contains no point of c g = 0 and other singularities (see Figure 1). The leading-order Taylor expansion (2.1) and the resulting transformations are expected to be accurate when α(S) -α(T ) is small, which is guaranteed if |ω i | or |α i | is small. This condition is often satisfied for viscous instability of shear flows, such as the Blasius boundary layer. However, for inviscid Rayleigh instability modes, their growth rates may not be small enough for the first-order transformation to be accurate, in which case a second-order Taylor expansion can be performed to obtain improved transformations, as will be shown later.</p>
        <p>Transformations (2.3) and (2.6), which are a result of consistent Taylor expansion, reduce to Gaster's transformation (1.2) only if</p>
        <p>(2.7)</p>
        <p>The relative error incurred is [(dω i /dα)/(dω r /dα)] 2 as can be inferred by comparing (1.2) with (2.3) and (2.6). Gaster (1962) argued that condition (2.7) was also guaranteed by |ω i | ≪ 1, which is however not true. With condition |ω i | ≪ 1, the only assumption that Gaster prepared to make, the transformation should be (2.3) rather than (1.2).</p>
        <p>Later Peng &amp; Williams (1987) suggested that a further restriction was required, namely,</p>
        <p>, which implies that the mode must be nearly neutral. However, this is neither necessary nor sufficient for (2.7) or (2.3), as will be shown later. Note that there is actually no need to neglect dω i /dα since the transformation with the complex group velocity can be implemented equally as easily as with a real group velocity. It is important to emphasise that without needing further restriction (2.7) for its validity, the present transformation (2.3) is more general. The result may be improved by including the second-order term in the Taylor expansion,</p>
        <p>which is a quadratic equation. For modes having the same frequency, ω(S) -ω(T ) = -iω i (T ), equation (2.8) can be solved to obtain α(S)</p>
        <p>where of the two roots we have taken the one which reduces to the first-order relation (2.3) when d 2 ω/dα 2 → 0, while the other, which does not, is spurious and rejected.</p>
        <p>In numerical calculations, we solve the linear eigenvalue problem for temporal instability for α and α ± ∆α (with ∆α ≪ 1) to obtain ω(α) and ω(α ± ∆α), which are then used in a finite difference to evaluate d 2 ω/dα 2 . This adds very little computational cost. A flowchart showing the calculation process of the temporal-spatial transformation is given in the appendix.</p>
        <p>For the secondary instability of streak flows, perturbations of the normal mode form can also be taken to be a travelling wave, φ(x, y, z, t) = φ(y, z)e i(αx-ωt) + c.c.,</p>
        <p>(2.10)</p>
        <p>where the eigenfunction φ depends on z as well as on y as the base flow profiles do. Since the dependence of the modes on the streamwise coordinate x and time t is of the form of the same form as for primary instability, the temporal-spatial transformations (2.3) and (2.9) remain directly applicable despite that the eigenfunction depends on y and z.</p>
        <p>2.2. Temporal-spatial transformation for secondary instability of primary travelling-wave modes 2.2.1. Secondary instability theory of two-dimensional primary waves</p>
        <p>The concept and theory of secondary instability were first proposed by Herbert (1983). The key proposition is that when a primary mode grows to reach a sufficiently large amplitude, the superimposed state of the unperturbed flow and the primary mode disturbance forms a new base flow that may become unstable to certain three-dimensional disturbances. The new base flow can be written as</p>
        <p>where φ 0 is the original unperturbed flow, φ m (m = 0) represent the primary mode and its harmonics, φ0 the mean-flow distortion, and A is a measure of the overall amplitude.</p>
        <p>Obviously, the new base flow is a function of time t in the original frame (x, t), but upon assuming the primary disturbance has nearly saturated and introducing the travelling coordinate x = x -c r t, where c r stands for the phase velocity of the primary mode, the new base state appears stationary in the new reference frame, and is a periodic function of x so that the secondary instability is of parametric resonance type and Floquet theory can readily be applied.</p>
        <p>A secondary instability mode may then be expressed as φ S (x, y, z, t) = e σt e γ xe iβz e iǫαx j φS,j (y) e i(jαx) + c.c.</p>
        <p>(2.12)</p>
        <p>where Φ(x, y) = Φ(x + 2π/α, y) with φS,j representing the shape of each constituting Fourier component, β stands for the spanwise wavenumber, while the parameters σ and γ will be assigned appropriate values depending on whether temporal or spatial instability is considered as we will discuss later. The present expression is different from that in Herbert (1988) as we have introduced explicitly the detuning parameter ǫα, despite the fact that it may be absorbed into γ. Since we can either set γ i = 0, or γ i turns out to be rather small (see below), the parameter ǫ measures the detuning between the new base flow U b (x, y) and the secondary disturbance with the Floquet exponent ǫ ∈ [0, 1/2]; ǫ outside of this range can be shifted to the interval due to the periodic condition. When ǫ = 0, the disturbance is referred to as a fundamental mode, which has the same frequency (or streamwise wavenumber) as that of the primary mode; when ǫ = 1/2, the disturbance is referred to as a subharmonic mode, whose frequency (or streamwise wavenumber) is half of that of the primary mode; detuned-resonance modes correspond to 0&lt;ǫ&lt;1/2. The above discussion indicates that the introduction of ǫα allows us to decide a priori which types of the resonances to consider.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the expression in Herbert (1988) has no ǫα and the detuning effect, or the form of resonance, is determined/represented by γ i , the imaginary part of γ. In temporal secondary instability analysis, it is necessary to set γ r = 0 while γ i ∈ [0, α/2] may be specified a priori, and then σ is solved as the complex-value eigenvalue with σ r measuring the growth rate and (σ i -γ i c r ) the frequency shift from that of the primary wave. For spatial secondary instability analysis, the restriction σ r -γ r c r = 0 is imposed to ensure that the amplification occurs only in the streamwise direction. If one chooses to specify γ i beforehand as was described in Herbert (1988), then the two real quantities, γ r and σ i , are to be found as the eigenvalue with the frequency shift corresponding to σ i -γ i c r . Computationally, they are not easy to obtain because they do not form the real and imaginary parts of a complex variable. For the same reason, the analyticity of the dispersion relation and the ensuing Cauchy-Riemann conditions, which are crucial in deriving the transformations and corresponding validity conditions, are lost. Alternatively, one may specify the frequency shift beforehand and solve for γ in terms of it. The form of resonance could only be determined posteriori since it is characterised by γ i .</p>
        <p>With ǫα present in (2.12), the meaning and assignment of σ and γ, both being complex valued in general, are now discussed. Note that e σt e γ x = e (σ-γcr)t e γx ≡ e σt e γx .</p>
        <p>(2.13)</p>
        <p>For a temporal mode, the spatial growth rate γ r = 0, and σ r is the temporal growth rate. With ǫα playing the role of γ i in Herbert's form, we can set γ i = 0 and hence γ = 0, and solve for σ as a complex-valued eigenvalue. It follows that (σ i -ǫαc r ) and ǫα represent the shifts of the frequency and streamwise wavenumber of the secondary mode with respect to those of the primary wave. The conversion of the temporal growth rate to the spatial counterpart requires dσ/dγ and d 2 σ/dγ 2 at γ = 0, which are calculated by solving the temporal eigenvalue problem to obtain σ for γ close to γ = 0 but on the imaginary axis as will be described later. Importantly, the analyticity of σ as a function of γ allows the temporal-spatial transforms to be derived and corresponding validity condition established in a similar manner to the case of primary instability. For a spatial mode, the constraint that the temporal growth σr = σ r -γ r c r = 0 must be imposed. The appropriate form of a general physically admissible secondary mode is e iσit e γx , a form to which a temporal mode is also converted when the frequency is preserved. We treat σi as a parameter to remove the appearance of γ i whereby ensuring analyticity. With this, γ as a complex variable, and ǫ and σi as real parameters appear in the spatial eigenvalue problem, which can be solved for eigenvalue γ = γ(ǫ, σi ) using a solver similar to that for the temporal counterpart. We take σi = σ i (T ) in the direct calculations of the spatial growth rate to validate the transformations.</p>
        <p>It turns out that γ i is rather small and significantly smaller than γ r . In solving the nonlinear spatial eigenvalue numerically, the search (i.e. initial guess) for γ on the complex γ-plane can be restricted to a narrow horizontal strip close to the real axis, which is another benefit of introducing ǫα.</p>
        <p>The discussions above indicate that the introduction of ǫ allows for a priori selection of the type of resonance for consideration, and more importantly renders the eigenvalue to be a single complex-valued variable whereby ensuring analyticity of the dispersion relation as well as convenient and efficient numerical implementation.</p>
        <p>Substitution of (2.12) into the N-S equations linearized about (2.11) leads to a system of infinite dimension,</p>
        <p>where L denotes a vector differential operator with respect to y, and φS is the dependent variable formed by φS,j . The system (2.14) is subject to homogeneous boundary conditions. The fourth-order central difference scheme is used for discretization in the wallnormal direction. The resulting algebraic eigenvalue problems, including linear eigenvalue problems and nonlinear ones, are solved by 
            <rs type="software">ARPACK</rs> (Lehoucq et al. 1998).
        </p>
        <p>In order to validate our SIT (secondary instability theory) code, the linear eigenvalue problem is solved for the two cases in Ng &amp; Erlebacher (1992): subharmonic instability of a two-dimensional Mack mode at M ∞ = 4.5 and fundamental instability of a twodimensional first mode at M ∞ = 1.6. In each case, several primary-mode amplitudes are considered. The results obtained by the present SIT code are shown in Figure 2 and compared with the published data of Ng &amp; Erlebacher (1992). Good agreement is observed; the small difference is found to be caused by under-resolution in the wallnormal direction of the calculations in Ng &amp; Erlebacher (1992). Although not shown, our result, obtained using a fine mesh, is in agreement with that of Li et al. (2012). All these indicate that our SIT code is reliable.</p>
        <p>Herbert's transformation can be stated as</p>
        <p>which converts the temporal growth rate σ r , obtained by solving the linear eigenvalue problem, to the spatial growth rate γ r . As an assessment of its validity and accuracy, the transformation (2.15) is applied to a case in Ng &amp; Erlebacher (1992), where the base flow of the secondary instability is expressed by (2.11) with φ 0 (y) being the Blasius profile, the solution of the primary Mack mode being truncated to retain only the fundamental component and normalised such that max| T1 | 2 = 1 2 , where T1 is the wall-normal distribution of the temperature perturbation. The relevant parameters are M ∞ = 4.5, Re = 10 4 , α = 2.52 and β = 2.1, and the primary-mode amplitude A is varied.</p>
        <p>The temporal growth rates σ r , obtained by solving the linear eigenvalue problem, are converted to the spatial growth rate using (2.15). The results are displayed in Figure 3 for the subharmonic and fundamental resonances. Comparison is made with the spatial growth rates computed directly by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Our SIT code for direct spatial solutions has been carefully validated in Xu &amp; Liu (2022), where good agreement was found between the direct spatial solutions and the predictions by NPSE (non-linear parabolized stability equations) and DNS (direct numerical simulations). For the secondary instability of subharmonic resonance, good agreement is observed (Figure 3(a)). However, in the case of fundamental resonance there is significant difference, especially for large primary-mode amplitude A, e.g. for A &gt; 0.5 the error is in the range of 30 -40%, and Herbert's transformation fails (Figure 3(b)). This raises the question as to why there is such a contrast of performance. The desire to answer the question prompted us to revisit Gaster's and Herbert's transformations.</p>
        <p>For modes in the form of (2.12) with (2.13), the secondary instability defines the dispersion relation, σ -γc r = σ(γ).</p>
        <p>(2.16) Given that the temporal-spatial conversion is established in the complex parameter planes, by considering a general dispersion relation, the specific physical form of the instability, e.g. primary instability of a streamwise homogeneous flow or secondary instability of a spatially periodic flow, does not actually matter thanks to the analyticity of the dispersion relation. It follows that the required transformations pertinent to the modal form (2.12) may follow directly from (2.3) and (2.9) by replacing ω and α by iσ and -iγ respectively. Equivalently, they can be derived by Taylor expansion of (2.16),</p>
        <p>Again, there are two ways to relate a temporal mode to its spatial counterpart. Here, we take the more natural and convenient option that the two modes have the same real frequency, σi (S) = σi (T ). With detuning being accounted for by ǫ, we set γ(T ) = 0 for a temporal mode, while for a spatial mode σr (S) = 0. Then (2.17) becomes</p>
        <p>If first-order approximation in (2.18) is made, we have</p>
        <p>The derivative may be computed by taking a purely imaginary increment ∆γ = i∆γ i from γ = 0 because ∆γ i can be introduced and corresponding σ calculated more easily in our code than with real γ. It is then convenient to set γ = iγ i , and the first-order derivative of σ with respect to γ can be expressed as,</p>
        <p>and evaluated using a finite difference approximation. Use of (2.19) gives</p>
        <p>(2.22) This is the consistent first-order transformation that converts temporal growth rates to spatial growth rates for the secondary instability. Similar to the case of primary instability, the validity of the transformation (2.19) can be established from the viewpoint of analyticity. The Taylor expansion (2.17) is justified provided that |γ(S) -γ(T )| = |γ(S)| is small enough (i.e. γ(S) is in a vicinity of γ = 0 where σ(γ) is analytic), which is guaranteed if the temporal growth rate σ r is small. This is the condition for the transformation (2.19) or (2.22) to be valid. Note that there is no need to impose the extra condition |σ r | ≪ |σ i |, or |γ r | ≪ |γ i |, which does not hold for the secondary instability as will be seen later. It now transpires that the firstorder transformation (2.22) reduces to Herbert's transformation (2.15) if it turns out that |dσ/dγ i | ≪ c r . In passing, we note that if |dσ r /dγ i | ≪ |dσ i /dγ i |, then neglect of dσ r /dγ i in (2.22) would lead to a transformation equivalent to Gaster's transformation for the secondary instability (cf. Koch et al. (2000)). However, |dσ r /dγ i | ≪ |dσ i /dγ i | is seldom the case for the secondary instability of primary waves. It is likely that for secondary instability, σ r = O(σ i ) and dσ r /dγ = O(dσ i /dγ). Note that mathematically dσ/dγ plays a similar role as dω/dα does in the case of the primary instability. The transformation (2.22) is invertible when dσ/dγ = 0 and is valid provided that the disc |γ -γ(T )| |γ(S) -γ(T )| is free of any singularity and the point where dσ/dγ = 0. Interestingly, dσ/dγ = 0 occurs when the secondary instability becomes absolute because the former turns out to be the necessary condition for the latter according to the criterion for absolute instability of a general spatially periodic flow (Brevdo &amp; Bridges (1996)). As with primary instability, the spatial growth rate is no longer relevant in this case. This connection between the breakdown of the spatial-temporal transformations and absolute instability, whether primary or secondary, is rather intriguing.</p>
        <p>If the second-order term in expansion (2.18) is retained, the quadratic equation of γ(S) can be solved to obtain</p>
        <p>where the second-order derivative is evaluated by using</p>
        <p>numerically: we first calculate σ (or σ) for ±γ i (with γ i ≪ 1) in addition to γ i = 0 and then a finite difference is applied to obtain the second-order derivative. The temporalspatial transformation is performed following the flowchart shown in the appendix. Note again that the calculations involve solving the linear eigenvalue problem, which amounts to little extra cost. Care must be taken when comparing the converted and directly calculated γ. Note that they are of the forms e [γx+iσi(T )t] and e [γx+(σ-γcr)t] , respectively. The two are identical if we take σ = γc r + iσ i (T ), i.e. σi = σ i (T ) in the direct calculation.</p>
        <p>Conversion will be performed for the most unstable temporal secondary mode. This is of course inadequate for solving the signalling problem, i.e. for tracing the spatial development of a general time-periodic disturbance with a fixed frequency, ω say, because that would require calculation and superposition of all secondary unstable modes with a fixed ω. However, it is possible to trace the downstream evolution of an unstable secondary mode with a fixed frequency ω, in which case ǫ is chosen such that (1 + ǫ)αc r -σ i (T ; ǫ) = ω according to (2.12).</p>
        <p>Since high accuracy of Gaster's transformation for viscous shear instability has been well established, we consider inviscid Rayleigh instability, using a mixing layer with a non-dimensional base-flow profile, as a vehicle, where χ stands for the ratio of the velocities of the two merging free streams. The spatial instability was well studied (Michalke (1965)), and absolute instability arises when χ &lt; χ c = -0.136 (Huerre &amp; Monkewitz (1985)), but existing transformations did not perform well due in part to its relatively large growth rate (Peng &amp; Williams (1987); Roychowdhury &amp; Sreedhar (1992)). For the case of χ = 0, we re-calculated the spatial eigenvalues α in the entire instability band, as well as the temporal eigenvalues ω. In order to resolve neutral and nearly neutral modes, we employed a viscous eigenvalue solver, in which a very high Reynolds number, 10 8 , is specified. The temporal eigenvalues were then converted to their spatial counterparts using different transformations. The comparison is shown in Figure 4. In order to shed light on the validity and accuracy of the transformations, the first-and second-order derivatives, dω/dα and d 2 ω/dα 2 , are computed and displayed in Figure 5. The first-order transformation (2.3), which involves the complex group velocity, gives accurate wavenumber α r in the entire instability band (Figure 4(a)), and more significantly accurate spatial growth rates as well, except for nearly most unstable modes. The error there can be as large as 20% due to large growth rates, and may be reduced by applying the second-order transformation (2.9). Indeed, the latter turned out to give both the spatial growth rates and the wavenumbers almost indistinguishable to graphical precision from the results of direct spatial stability analysis. In contrast, the original Gaster's transformation does not give spatial growth rate, or wavenumber α r with satisfactory accuracy. Note that at ω r ≈ 0.22, where the growth rate ω i attains its maximum, the results given by the first-order and Gaster's transformations overlap, due to the fact that dω i /dα = 0 (Figure 5) so that the first-order transformation reduces to Gaster's transformation. Appreciable error exists for nearly neutral modes ω r ≈ 0.5 despite the fact that not only -α i (or ω i ) is small, but also</p>
        <p>This indicates that the above condition is not sufficient for the validity of Gaster's transformation, contrary to the suggestion of |α i /α r | ≪ 1, which was made, e.g. in Peng &amp; Williams (1987), and has probably been accepted by many researchers.</p>
        <p>Considerable discrepancy between the converted growth rates using Gaster's transformation and directly calculated ones exists also in the low-frequency limit ω r ≪ 1, where α r ≪ 1 and the growth rates are small (|ω i |, |α i | ≪ 1), showing that the past assertion that Gaster's transformation 'is valid only very close to the neutral point corresponding to α r = 0 and α i = 0' (Roychowdhury &amp; Sreedhar (1992)) is completely erroneous. Clearly, that |ω i | or |α i | is small does not guarantee the validity of Gaster's transformation. What is required instead is (2.7), which is unfortunately not warranted since dω i /dα = O(dω r /dα) = O(1) in the majority of the instability band as Figure 5 shows. Specifically, in the long-wavelength limit (α ≪ 1), the dispersion relation reduces asymptotically to (Drazin &amp; Howard (1962))</p>
        <p>and so the group velocity c g = 1 2 (1 + χ) + i(1 -χ) is complex; for χ = 0, c g = (1 + i)/2, whose real and imaginary parts are the same. On the other hand, for nearly neutral modes, the group velocity is found as (Wu &amp; Tian (2012))</p>
        <p>which is again complex, and specifically c g = (1-2i/π)/2 for χ = 0. The numerical values of c g at these two limits are in good agreement with the analytical ones (Figure 5(a)). The behaviours of dω i /dα near the peak growth and neutrality show that |ω i | ≪ |ω r | is neither necessary nor sufficient condition for (2.7). In contrast to Gaster's transformation, the first-order transformation (2.3) is not subject to this restriction, and it provides accurate spatial growth rates.</p>
        <p>Figure 6 shows the converted and directly calculated spatial eigenvalues for χ = -0.13, which is just above the critical value for the onset of absolute instability (χ &lt; χ c = -0.136) (Huerre &amp; Monkewitz 1985); the latter was implied by an almost vertical slope of the α r -ω r curve (Figure 6(a)). The prediction by Gaster's transformation is rather unsatisfactory. The first-order transformation (2.3) is accurate except for ω r in the interval (0.12, 0.26) centred at the maximum growth rate, where appreciable error up to 40% arises. The second-order transformation (2.9) performs satisfactorily in the entire instability band, with only minor discrepancy near the peak growth. This difference is caused by the truncation of the Taylor expansion, and may further be reduced by using a higher-order transformation. However, there is little point to pursue this since the error is already very small. It is worth emphasising that the accuracy is realized despite the fact that -α i is comparable with α r . It is also worth pointing out that the abrupt and seemingly non-smooth change of -α i with ω r in spatial instability (Figure 6 prompted us to check if a similar behaviour occurs with ω versus α for temporal modes since this may affect accurate evaluation of dω/dα and d 2 ω/dα 2 using finite differences. Interestingly, both ω r and ω i turns out to vary rather gradually with α.</p>
        <p>The transformations are also applied to a plane jet, which supports two types of modes, sinuous and varicose modes. The Bickley jet profile,</p>
        <p>is taken as a convenient example, and the transformed spatial eigenvalues using the three transformations are displayed in Figure 7 and compared with those of direct calculations.</p>
        <p>For the varicose mode, all three transformations give practically the same result for the whole instability band, but a zoomed view reveals that the second-order transformation is more accurate. For the sinuous mode, the predictions by all three transformations are highly accurate for ω r &gt; 0.5, but for ω r &lt; 0.5 the transformed growth rates by Gaster's and first-order transformations deviate considerably from the directly calculated values (Figure 7 (b)). The error in the wavenumbers is rather minor, just discernable with the Gaster's transformation. The converted spatial growth rates by the second-order transformation (2.9) overlap those of the direct calculation in the entire band of the sinuous instability. It is worth noting that while gross inaccurate for nearly neutral modes on the mixing layer, Gaster's transformation turned out to be accurate for nearly neutral (sinuous and varicose) modes on the jet. This can be contributed to the fact that the group velocities c g = 1.0051 -0.2224i and 0.6039 -0.1670i for the sinuous and varicose modes, respectively (Drazin &amp; Howard 1962), and so with the ratio |c g,i /c g,r | being about 1/4, the relative error due to neglecting c g,i is merely 7%. The plane jet is interesting because the dispersion relations in the long-wavelength limit are non-analytic, which has implications for the validity of the transformations (Brevdo (1992)). For the varicose mode, as α → 0 the dispersion relation has the asymptotic approximation (Drazin &amp; Howard 1962)</p>
        <p>where a 0 and a 1 are real constants; for the profile (3.2), a 0 = 1 and a 1 = (π/4) 2/3 . comparison between the directly calculated spatial modes (symbols) and the converted results using Gaster's transformation (dash-dotted line), first-order transformation (dashed line) and second-order transformation (solid line). (a) Temporal eigenvalues versus wavenumber α; (b) spatial growth rates versus frequency ωr.</p>
        <p>Clearly, with α = 0 being a branch point, the function (3.3) is non-analytic at α = 0. It follows that the group velocity c g = a 0 + 5 3 a 1 e 2πi/3 α 2/3 ≈ a 0 to leading-order accuracy. Thus the first-order transformation reads</p>
        <p>and the converted spatial growth rate</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the dispersion relation (3.3) can be inverted to give</p>
        <p>the imaginary part of which gives the same spatial growth rate -α i as (3.5). Since the group velocity c g and the phase velocity c are both approximately a 0 , which is real, Gaster's transformation stands as a valid approximation, as the numerical results in Figure 7 confirm. For the weak non-analyticity of (3.3), the branch point α = 0 remains outside of the disc on the α-plane (see Figure 1), |α -α(T )| |α(S) -α(T )| = O(ω 5/3 ) since α(T ) = O(ω) so that the Taylor series is deemed convergent. Note further that</p>
        <p>), much smaller than the first-order term dω dα α(S) -α(T ) , which is of O(α 5/3 ), and higher-order terms are progressively smaller in the limit α → 0, indicating that the Taylor series is asymptotic as well . Hence the present weak non-analyticity does not affect the validity of the transformations even in the vicinity of the branch point singularity.</p>
        <p>For the sinuous mode, as α → 0 the dispersion relation reads (Drazin &amp; Howard 1962)</p>
        <p>where a 0 and a 1 are real constants; for the profile (3.2) a 0 = 2 3 and a 1 = 1, and (3.7) turns out to hold up to ω r = 0.05 (Figure 8 (a)). The group velocity c g = 2a 1 α+i 3 2 a 0 α 1/2 , clearly c g,i ≫ c g,r , and so Gaster's transformation is not expected to hold. Indeed, application of this transformation gives</p>
        <p>indicating that the branch point α = 0 is within the disc |α -α(T )| &lt; a0 2a1 [α(T )] 1/2 . Gaster's transformation is therefore invalid, and this explains its very poor performance displayed in Figure 8(b). In contrast, the consistent first-order transformation gives</p>
        <p>and so the spatial growth rate is found as</p>
        <p>where use has been made of the fact that ω r = a 1 [α(T )] 2 for a temporal mode. The direct inversion of (3.7) gives</p>
        <p>which gives the spatial growth rate</p>
        <p>Curiously, this is different from (3.10), and there arises the question concerning the relation between the two. To answer the question, we note that for the dispersion relation (3.7), dω/dα = O(α 1/2 ) and d 2 ω/dα 2 = O(α -1/2 ), and so the first-order term dω dα α(S)α(T ) = O(α 3/2 ), the second-order term d 2 ω dα 2 α(S)-α(T ) 2 = O(α 3/2 ), and higher-order terms remain of this order in the limit α → 0. Hence, unlike the varicose mode (3.3), the non-analyticity of the sinuous mode (3.7) renders the Taylor series non-asymptotic. This explains why (3.10) differs from the asymptotic approximation (3.12). On the other hand, it follows from (3.9) that indicating that the branch point α = 0 is outside of the disc |α -α(T )| &lt; 2 3 α(T ), and the Taylor series must therefor be convergent. Alternatively, by a close inspection it may be deduced that for n 3, the nth-term in the expansion has the expression</p>
        <p>The ratio test shows that the radius of convergence is α(T ), which is the distance of α(T ) to the branch point as expected by the consideration of analyticity. From this and (3.13) follows the convergence of the Taylor expansion. Both arguments lead to the conclusion that (3.10) and its second-order version represent the truncations of a convergent series. The branch-point singularity of the sinuous mode (3.7) does not, even in its vicinity, cause breakdown of transformations (2.3) or (2.9). Figure 8(b) shows the analytical approximation (3.10) follows closely its numerical equivalent first-order transformation (2.3), while the analytical inversion (3.12) is in good agreement with the direct numerical spatial solution. Remarkably, the second-order transformation (2.9) proves to be accurate for all ω r &gt; 0.</p>
        <p>Temporal-to-spatial transformation is even more relevant when secondary instability of Görtler vortices or streaks is studied because for a bi-global eigenvalue problem computation of the spatial growth rates is much more difficult and costly than solving a temporal instability problem. As an illustration, we consider secondary instability of Görtler vortices which were calculated by Xu et al. (2017) pertaining to the measurement at x * = 100cm in the experiment of Swearingen &amp; Blackwelder (1987). The bi-global eigen solutions are obtained by solving an inviscid instability problem and so only unstable modes are found. Figure 9 displays the directly calculated spatial eigenvalues and the converted ones using Gaster's transformation (1.2), the first-and and second-order transformations, (2.3) and (2.9). Gaster's and the first-order transformations both give growth rates and wavenumbers with satisfactory accuracy. Their comparable performance can be attributed to the fact that dω i /dα is about 1/4 of dω r /dα (Figure 10(a)) so that the condition (2.7) may be considered as being satisfied approximately, which means that the difference between the results is only about 7%. The good accuracy of these transformations is also due to the fact that d 2 ω/dα 2 is rather small as Figure 9 indicates minor differences from the direct spatial solution arise near the peak growth rate, and they are eliminated almost completely when the second-order transformation (2.9) is applied.</p>
        <p>We first revisit the cases shown in Figure 3, which indicate that Herbert's transformation failed for the fundamental resonance. The data for temporal secondary instability is now converted to spatial secondary instability characteristics using the newly developed first-and second-order transformations, (2.22) and (2.23). The results are shown in Figure 11. For the subharmonic resonance (Figure 11(a)), the first-order transformation (2.3) and Herbert's transformation (2.15) both give correct results, in good agreement with those given by direct spatial secondary instability analysis. A zoomed view indicates that the first-order transformation is actually more accurate than Herbert's transformation, while the predictions by the second-order transformation and direct spatial calculations are practically identical. However, for the fundamental resonance (Figure 11(b)), the firstorder and Herbert's transformations give reasonably accurate spatial growth rates only when the primary-mode amplitude is small, A &lt; 0.35 and A &lt; 0.2 respectively, beyond which the accuracy deteriorates as A increases. When A &gt; 0.5, Herbert's transformation gives wrong spatial growth rates while the first-order transformation (2.22) is also grossly inaccurate due to fairly large growth rates. Using the second-order transformation (2.23), the converted growth rates turn out to have satisfactory accuracy. The reasons why Herbert's transformation works and is accurate for subharmonic modes but not for fundamental modes will be discussed later.</p>
        <p>We now turn to applications of the transformations to detuned resonance, and consider first the case with a moderate primary-wave amplitude A = 0.45. The converted and directly calculated spatial eigenvalues, γ r and γ i , for the full range detuning parameter ǫ in [0,0.5] are shown in Figure 12. The Herbert's transformation gives accurate growth rate γ r for ǫ &gt;0.16, but deteriorates immediately when ǫ &lt; 0.16. The second-order transformation is able to predict the growth rate with high accuracy for the entire range of ǫ. The first-order transformation performs equally well except for ǫ &lt; 0.02. These two transformations also give accurate γ i for ǫ &gt; 0.04, below which γ i is slightly under predicted by the second-order transformation but significantly by the first-order transformation (Figure 12 (b)). There is no corresponding formula for γ i in Herbert's transformation. If σ i /c r is used, the converted γ i is agreement with the directly calculated result only for ǫ &gt; 0.3, and the two bear little semblance for ǫ &lt; 0.3. In order to distinguish further the performances of different transformations, a case with a large amplitude of A = 0.88 is chosen. For such a large value of A, there exist multiple unstable secondary modes at each ǫ. We focus on the most unstable one. The converted spatial eigenvalues, γ r and γ i , for the full range of detuning parameter ǫ ∈ [0, 0.5], are plotted in Figure 13. The first-and second-order transformations give almost the same and sufficiently accurate results for ǫ &gt; 0.04. Herbert's transformation turns out to be just as accurate for ǫ &gt;0.18, and but appreciable difference exists for ǫ &lt;0.18. Nevertheless, it still gives reasonably accurate spatial eigenvalues for ǫ &gt; 0.04. When ǫ is below 0.04, Herbert's and the first-order transformations are highly inaccurate, significantly under predicting the spatial growth rate γ r with the respective errors being the greatest at ǫ = 0. The second-order transformation (2.23) is highly accurate, giving spatial eigenvalues in almost perfect agreement with those from direct spatial eigenvalue calculations for 0 ǫ 0.02. However, a complication arises in the small interval 0.02 &lt; ǫ &lt; 0.04. Temporal stability analysis shows that the two most unstable temporal modes are fairly close to each other. This is likely to undermine the validity of our transformations since the latter are invalid in the extreme (limiting) case where two modes coalesce. The precise impact of near coalescence of two modes on the validity and accuracy of the transformations remains to be fully analysed. We speculate that it reduces the radius of convergence and/or the rate of convergence with respect to the order of the Taylor expansion. On the other hand, while the most unstable temporal mode remains on the same branch as ǫ varies, the spatial stability analysis shows that there is a crossover of the two most unstable spatial modes at ǫ ≈ 0.04. In the interval 0.02 &lt; ǫ &lt; 0.04, the comparison between the directly calculated and transformed eigenvalues becomes complicated, and a satisfactory agreement is denied. The resolution is left for future investigation. It is worth noting that the growth rates γ r are appreciably greater than the wavenumber γ i for ǫ &gt; 0.05, nevertheless, the transformations (2.22) and (2.23) performed well, confirming that |γ r /γ i | ≪ 1 or |σ r /σ i | ≪ 1 is not a necessary condition for them to be valid. Since the full frequency shift is σ i -(γ i + ǫα)c r , i.e., σi -ǫαc r , we plot γ r versus σ i -(γ i + ǫα)c r as well as σi . The results are displayed in Figure 14, demonstrating again the satisfactory performance of the second-order transformation (2.23). It is worth noting that for the subharmonic and fundamental resonances σi = 0, which indicates that the secondary modes and the primary wave have the same phase speed. For 0 &lt; ǫ &lt; 0.5, |σ i | &lt; 0.01 (|σ i /(αc r )| &lt; 0.005) is rather small, which means the most physically relevant secondary modes tend to propagate at almost the same phase speed as that of the primary wave, that is, they are synchronised or 'phase locked' (Wu &amp; Stewart 1996;Wu et al. 1996).</p>
        <p>In order to understand the performances of the transformations, we calculated dσ/dγ and d 2 σ/dγ 2 , and the outcomes are shown in Figure 15. For the subharmonic mode (ǫ = 0.5), dσ r /dγ and dσ i /dγ are of O(10 -2 ), and are thus negligible in comparison with c r , which is c r = 0.90137. Consequently, the transformation (2.22) is well approximated by Herbert's transformation. For 0.05 &lt; ǫ &lt; 0.5, dσ r /dγ and dσ i /dγ are rather moderate, being less than 0.08, and so neglecting them does not cause significant error, which is why Herbert's transformation also performed fairly well for detuned modes in this range of ǫ. It should be emphasised that the smallness of dσ r /dγ and dσ i /dγ is established posteriori by numerical computation; there is no a priori reason or analysis for one to conclude that they must be small. In this sense, Herbert's transformation works primarily by coincidence, and is purely empirical in its nature, unlike a proper mathematical approximation in which the error could in principle be made arbitrarily small. Indeed, for 0 ǫ 0.05, which includes the fundamental resonance (ǫ = 0), dσ r /dγ and dσ i /dγ acquire rather sizeable values greater than 0.2. The consistent first-order transformation (2.22) needs to be used at least, and this leads to better predictions than Herbert's transformation does. However due to increased growth rate and the fact that the secondorder derivative d 2 σ/dγ 2 acquires large values (Figure 15 (b)), the second-order term in the expansion (2.18) becomes appreciable. With this term included, the second-order transformation (2.23) is able to predict spatial secondary instability characteristics with adequate accuracy for 0 ǫ 0.02.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we have revisited the transformations of temporal and spatial growth rates of shear instabilities in weakly non-parallel flows. As an effort to clarify the validity and accuracy of the widely used Gaster's and Herbert's transformations for primary and secondary instabilities respectively, we derived the consistent transformations simply by using Taylor expansion of the dispersion relation for the instability. A point that was emphasized in the present paper but seemed overlooked previously is that the conversions between temporal and spatial growth rates may be established for modes having the same frequency or wavenumber, with the former being more natural. The validity of the transformations derived, consisting of first-and second-order versions, is guaranteed by analyticity of the dispersion relation, while the accuracy requires the growth rates to be small. The condition that the temporal/spatial growth rates are smaller than frequencies/wavenumbers are not required, and further light on this issue was shed by the discussion of the validity for the neutral modes and in the long-wavelength limit. For primary instability, the consistent first-order transformation is less restrictive than the original Gaster's transformation, and reduces to the latter under the additional condition that the imaginary part of the complex group velocity is much smaller than its real part, which forms the validity condition of Gaster's transformation together with the requirement of small growth rates. The previously suggested, and perhaps widely accepted, restriction that the temporal/spatial growth rates are much smaller than frequencies/wavenumbers is neither sufficient nor necessary. Since our first-order transformation can be implemented as easily as Gaster's transformation, there is no need to impose the additional condition, which is not readily met.</p>
        <p>For secondary instability of a two-dimensional primary mode, our first-order transformation represents a consistent approximation when the growth rates are small, and reduces to Herbert's transformation when dσ/dγ turns out to be small by coincidence. This additional constraint is satisfied in the case of subharmonic resonance, but not for the fundamental resonance, which explains why Herbert's transformation worked for the former but failed for the latter. Again, since the first-order transformation can be implemented with little extra computation there is no need to impose this extra condition, which is not always warranted.</p>
        <p>The transformations derived in the present paper can be implemented within temporal instability analysis to obtain the spatial instability characteristics without substantial extra computational cost. Applications of these transformations to inviscid instability of a mixing layer and a jet, secondary instability of Görtler vortices and secondary instability of primary Mack modes in a supersonic boundary layer, indicate that the firstorder transformation consistently outperforms Gaster's and Herbert's transformations, and significantly the second-order transformation is able to provide spatial instability characteristics practically identical to those obtained by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem for spatial instability. Only in the case where the mode is a double root or two modes come close to each other, the validity and accuracy are no longer warranted. This happens only for a very small subset of parameters. The second-order transformation thus stands as a useful tool, and can be employed in the e N -method to calculate the N-factor more effectively, saving the need of spatial instability analysis. Furthermore, the transformations can, with appropriate modifications, be applied to other instability problems such as primary crossflow instability in three-dimensional boundary layers, and the secondary instability of stationary and travelling-wave vortices.</p>
