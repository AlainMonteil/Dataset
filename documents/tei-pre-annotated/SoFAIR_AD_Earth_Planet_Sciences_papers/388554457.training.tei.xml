        <p>A growing body of observations worldwide has documented fault slip transients that radiate little or no seismic energy. The mechanisms that govern these slow slip events and their wide range of depths, slip rates, durations, stress drops, and recurrence intervals remain poorly known. Here we show that slow slip can be explained by a transition from rate-weakening frictional sliding at low slip rates toward rate-neutral or rate-strengthening behavior at higher slip rates, as has been observed experimentally. We use numerical simulations to illustrate that this rate-dependent transition quantitatively explains experimental data for natural fault rocks representative of materials in the source regions of slow slip events. With a standard constant-parameter rate-and-state friction law, slow slip events arise only near the threshold for slip instability.

        <p>Faults in nature can slip episodically during earthquakes, with slip rate typically larger than 1cm/s, but also in much slower transient slip events that are essentially aseismic. These include slow slip events (SSEs) which last days to weeks and are often associated with low-amplitude seismic tremors 1,2 . SSEs have been widely observed spanning a range of depths along subduction plate interfaces including Cascadia 2 , Mexico 3 , Japan 4 , Costa Rica 5 , and New Zealand 6 , as well as on continental transform faults including the San Andreas 7 and North Anatolian Faults 8 . In some cases, these phenomena have been linked to elevated pore pressure based on theoretical considerations, their sensitivity to tidal stresses, and their spatial correlation with zones of high Vp/Vs [9][10][11] .Faults in nature can slip episodically during earthquakes, with slip rate typically larger than 1cm/s, but also in much slower transient slip events that are essentially aseismic.

        <p>SSEs result, like regular earthquakes, from unstable frictional sliding 12,13 . Previous studies have shown that SSEs can arise in numerical simulations based on the rate-and-state 14 (RSF) formalism. Within the RSF framework, regular earthquakes (stick-slip) occur if the slipping area is larger than a critical patch size, and SSEs arise if the system is near critical. However, in this context, SSEs should be observed only over a very narrow range of parameters for which the fault lies precisely at, or very near the stable-unstable transition 12,13 (Figs. 1&amp;2). This contrasts with ubiquitous occurrence of SSEs spanning a diversity of geological environments in nature.SSEs result, like regular earthquakes, from unstable frictional sliding 12,13 .

        <p>However, recent laboratory measurements on both natural and synthetic fault gouges, including drill core from faults that are known to host SSEs, indicate that these parameters actually vary systematically with slip velocity [26][27][28] . The velocity dependence of Dc and a-b was reported more than a decade ago for some materials 29,30 , and has been speculated as a potential explanation for episodic slow slip [22][23][24] . These results suggest qualitatively that the increased stability at high slip velocity would suppress acceleration of slip, and accordingly widen the range of conditions for slow earthquake generation.

        <p>Our simulations for both constant (Fig. 1a) and velocity-dependent (Fig. 1b) RSF parameters are consistent with the theoretically defined stability criterion 25 (κ = K/ Kc= 1; bold black lines in Fig. 1a &amp;b). Note that Kc must be evaluated in a general form (see Methods; also ref 25) to account for rate-dependent RSF parameters. All cases with κ &lt; 1 converge toward repeating unstable slip (filled circles), whereas all cases with κ &gt; 1 converge to stable sliding (empty circles). In both cases, and as predicted by theory, slip transitions from stable to unstable as the normal stress is increased. In the experimental data 16 , the transition occurs at higher normal stress when the loading rate is increased; i.e. slip stabilizes at higher velocity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). This is not expected for constant parameter (regular) RSF, because the critical stiffness Kc is only expected to increase with slip velocity (Equation ( 6) in Methods). The observations are, however, consistent with a rate dependence of Dc and a-b, and this behavior is reproduced by simulations that account for this effect (Extended Data Fig. 2).Our simulations for both constant (Fig. 1a) and velocity-dependent (Fig. 1b) RSF parameters are consistent with the theoretically defined stability criterion 25 (κ = K/ Kc= 1; bold black lines in Fig. 1a &amp;b).

        <p>Another important difference is that constant RSF parameters predict an abrupt transition from steady sliding to fast earthquake-like stick-slip events, whereas rate dependent RSF parameters predict a more gradual transition (blue regions in Fig. 1b) and a broader range of loading velocities and normal stresses that yield a spectrum of slow slip events, consistent with field and lab results [15][16][17][18][19] . This difference is also evident from comparison of time series of both normalized shear stresses and the velocity of unstable sliding closest to the stability boundary (κ = 1) (Figs. 1c and1d). Constant parameter simulations for the laboratory experimental conditions produce regular stick slip with peak velocity 20 cm/s and slip duration ~ 1 ms (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the velocity dependent parameter cases result in slow events with peak velocity of ~ 80 µm/s and slip duration of ~1 s (Fig. 1d).Another important difference is that constant RSF parameters predict an abrupt transition from steady sliding to fast earthquake-like stick-slip events, whereas rate dependent RSF parameters predict a more gradual transition (blue regions in Fig. 1b) and a broader range of loading velocities and normal stresses that yield a spectrum of slow slip events, consistent with field and lab results [15][16][17][18][19] .

        <p>Simulations with velocity dependent RSF parameters agree much better with the laboratory results. The constant parameter case exhibits an abrupt transition at κ = 1 (the stability threshold), resulting in 2 ~ 3 orders of magnitude larger peak velocities (Fig. 2a) and 3~5 times larger stress drop (Fig. 2b) than the laboratory observations. In contrast, cases with velocity dependent RSF parameters produce a gradual evolution of slip behavior as κ approaches unity, in significantly better agreement with the laboratory experimental data. We note that the fit to laboratory data is not perfect; for Vpeak &gt; 1 mm/s, laboratory measurements of peak velocity are slower than model predictions (Fig. 2a). The overprediction of peak velocity may be explained by finite sampling frequency, derivation of velocity from discrete measurements in the lab, or other factors unaccounted for in our analysis.Simulations with velocity dependent RSF parameters agree much better with the laboratory results.

        <p>Our results also demonstrate that the peak slip velocity in slow stick slip events remains consistently lower than a commonly reported "cutoff velocity" that has been inferred at the transition from negative (a-b&lt;0) to positive (a-b&gt;0) rate-dependence of friction; furthermore, such a transition is not necessarily required to produce a spectrum of slow stick slip. This arises because slip behavior exhibits a strong dependence on the rate of friction change with velocity (second term in Equation (10) in Methods) as well as the absolute value of rate-dependence.Our results also demonstrate that the peak slip velocity in slow stick slip events remains consistently lower than a commonly reported "cutoff velocity" that has been inferred at the transition from negative (a-b&lt;0) to positive (a-b&gt;0) rate-dependence of friction; furthermore, such a transition is not necessarily required to produce a spectrum of slow stick slip.

        <p>With a spring-slider approximation approach, we conducted multiple simulations with parameters representative of a generic subduction zone (Fig. 3a&amp;b), modified from the parameters of Scholz 31 for regular (constant parameter) RSF friction. At low slip rate (V&lt;&lt; Va=10 -9 m/s), steady-state friction is assumed to be rate-weakening (a0-b &lt; 0) between 7.5 km and 37.5 km depths, and rate-strengthening (a0-b &gt; 0) above and below this. The value of a0-b is constant and set to -0.003 between 15 km and 30 km, and it varies linearly with depth elsewhere (Fig. 3b). We consider two scenarios: one in which pore pressure is 70% of the lithostatic pressure, presumably representative of the typical pore pressure along subduction megathrusts 32 ; and a second case in which the pore pressure is set to 95% of the lithostatic pressure, which falls in the range of pore pressures approaching lithostatic values as suggested on the basis of forearc wedge taper angles and geophysical survey data 10,32 .

        <p>With regular RSF, the entire rate-weakening domain between 7.5-37.5 km depth produces simulated stick-slip events with high peak velocity (&gt;1cm/s) and relatively large stress drops (&gt;1MPa), even if a high pore pressure is assumed (Figs. 3c&amp;3d). In order to generate slow stickslip events in a case where RSF parameters are constant, effective normal stress must remain very small, and near neutral RSF behavior (with a-b &lt;&lt;10 -4 ) is required. This condition is met only in a very narrow zone at the transition from the rate-strengthening to the rate-weakening behavior that is not resolved with our simulations. This result is consistent with previously reported fault plane simulation results 13 showing that the range of fault length (stiffness) hosting slow slip is too small to be explained by standard constant parameter RSF 13 . However, with velocity dependent RSF parameters, slow slip transients (with velocities similar to those in subduction zone SSEs; 1nm/s -1µm/s) are simulated over a considerably broader region spanning this transition zone, and with a wider range of event characteristics (Fig. 3).With regular RSF, the entire rate-weakening domain between 7.5-37.5 km depth produces simulated stick-slip events with high peak velocity (&gt;1cm/s) and relatively large stress drops (&gt;1MPa), even if a high pore pressure is assumed (Figs. 3c&amp;3d).

        <p>Notably, all of our simulation results with velocity dependent a-b and Dc yield Vpeak &lt; 1 mm/s, which we regard as "slow" relative to the cm/ to m/s slip velocities typical of ordinary earthquakes (Fig. 3c, red and blue curves). Although not required, higher pore pressure (lower effective normal stress) leads to a decreased peak slip velocity, and hence further broadens the region where slow slip occurs. Stress drop and recurrence interval are also sensitive to pore pressure (Figs. 3d&amp;3e), such that modest variations are able to produce simulated SSE that span a wide spectrum of rates, recurrence, and durations, consistent with the broad range of observed SSE behavior in nature.Notably, all of our simulation results with velocity dependent a-b and Dc yield Vpeak &lt; 1 mm/s, which we regard as "slow" relative to the cm/ to m/s slip velocities typical of ordinary earthquakes (Fig. 3c, red and blue curves).

        <p>We considered case examples of well-characterized repeating SSEs in Cascadia 33 , Hikurangi 6 (New Zealand), Ryukyu 34 (Japan) and the Guerrero gap 35 (Mexico) (Fig. 4). These examples span a wide range of depths, from near surface to ~40 km, and a range of recurrence intervals from sub-annual to decadal. We explored a parameter space consistent with the laboratory constraints 16,27,29 (see Extended Data Fig. 3B). Assuming that GPS displacement is proportional to fault slip, we successfully reproduce the evolution and behavior of these well-characterized SSEs with only modest adjustment of the model parameters within the range of experimental data, using a single-degree-of-freedom approximation. Given that this approximation is not strictly valid as it is clear that SSE can expand and propagate 33 , we carried out tests (Extended data Fig. 5), which indicate that it is still a reasonable first-order approximation for typical rates of propagation of SSEs. Interestingly, our simulations also capture the asymmetric fast-acceleration and slowdeceleration characteristics of SSEs, which are most prominent in the Ryukyu and to a lesser degree the Mexican examples, and which can be observed in most of the GPS stations regardless of their relative locations to the slipping patch 36,37 . This behavior emerges in our simulations as a result of fundamental characteristics of RSF that lead to fast acceleration at (a-b)&lt;0 (nucleation phase in simulation), and slow deceleration for (a-b) ≈ 0 or (a-b)&gt; 0 (when slip decelerates).We considered case examples of well-characterized repeating SSEs in Cascadia 33 , Hikurangi 6 (New Zealand), Ryukyu 34 (Japan) and the Guerrero gap 35 (Mexico) (Fig. 4).

We assume 200km × 63 km slipping patch (light yellow) embedded in a half space with its lower edge at a depth of 26 km. For displacement of each patch, we impose the time evolution of slip derived from the spring-slider model adjusted to the Guerrero example (Fig. 4d). We considered three cases for slip propagation along the strike direction at: (i) 1km/day, (ii) 5km/day, and (iii) a case with simultaneous slip in the entire patch. Panel b shows an example of slip propagation for the 1km/day case. The fault slip is converted to surface deformation using an elastic dislocation (Okada) model 47 and the normalized displacements are plotted in panels c&amp;d for comparison with the observed Guerrero gap GPS timeseries. The result shows that the case with a propagation rate of 5km/day (red) is nearly indistinguishable from the case of simultaneous slip (equivalent to an infinitely fast propagation). The case with 1 km/day (blue) which is at the lower end of the typical rate of propagation of SSEs, is also only slightly altered by the effect of the propagation.Extended Data Fig. 5 Simple kinematic model for slip propagation. a: Model illustration.
