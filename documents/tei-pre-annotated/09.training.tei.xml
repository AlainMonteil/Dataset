        <p>The indispensable condition to ensure proper conservation of ancient iron artefacts is to reach a state of chemical and physical balance with the environment in which they are preserved [1].The indispensable condition to ensure proper conservation of ancient iron artefacts is to reach a state of chemical and physical balance with the environment in which they are preserved [1].</p>
        <p>In this sense, the recovery of irons from archaeological sites only takes place when their matrix reaches the equilibrium with the soil, maintaining it throughout the burial time. However, this delicate balance suffers a critical disruption during archaeological excavation. In fact, artefacts recovery exposes them to a completely different environment, resulting often in the activation of many degradation pathways [2].In this sense, the recovery of irons from archaeological sites only takes place when their matrix reaches the equilibrium with the soil, maintaining it throughout the burial time.

        <p>Therefore, conservators must act promptly in the later stages of archaeological excavation with the purpose of achieving, through specific conservation treatments, a renewed equilibrium with the new environmental context [3,4].Therefore, conservators must act promptly in the later stages of archaeological excavation with the purpose of achieving, through specific conservation treatments, a renewed equilibrium with the new environmental context [3,4].</p>
        <p>In this light, the work of conservators can be strongly benefited from analytical studies. In the early stage, the molecular analysis of iron artefacts enables the identification of the corrosion phases developed during the burial time. Those qualitative data are extremely important to conservators, helping them to identify the real preservation state of the analysed object. This is because each iron corrosion phase has a different influence on the conservation of artefacts. With regards to archaeological iron artefacts resumed from oxic environments, the corrosion system is generally mainly composed of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), goethite (α-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) and akaganeite (β-FeOOH). In this context, is it well known that magnetite and goethite are stable compounds that help the preservation of findings, whereas lepidocrocite and akaganeite can be considered as degradation accelerators, as seen in the literature [5][6][7].In this light, the work of conservators can be strongly benefited from analytical studies.

        <p>In addition to qualitative analysis, further useful information can be obtained by determining the relative concentration (quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis) of each iron phase composing the corrosion system. For example, the quantitative analysis of fragments that, one after the other, are removed by conservators during the conservation work helps to identify the in-depth distribution of the reactive degradation products and to characterize the reactivity of the whole corrosion system [8]. Such approaches were also developed in the context of atmospheric corrosion in which the quantification of iron phases was been to describe the stability of the corrosion layers [9,10].In addition to qualitative analysis, further useful information can be obtained by determining the relative concentration (quantitative or semi-quantitative analysis) of each iron phase composing the corrosion system.

        <p>The quantitative analysis of iron corrosion can also find reliable applications in the stages following the conservation works. In the short term, it can be used to control whether conservation treatments were able to stabilize the reactive corrosion phases [11].

        <p>In this context, molecular analytical techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) [14,15] and Mossbauer spectroscopy [16,17] have been extensively used with the specific purpose of determining the relative concentration of the phases that compose the iron corrosion systems.In this context, molecular analytical techniques such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) [14,15] and Mossbauer spectroscopy [16,17] have been extensively used with the specific purpose of determining the relative concentration of the phases that compose the iron corrosion systems.</p>

        <p>Considering that the intensity of Raman signals are proportional to the concentration, the most used quantification method is the one based on the use of external calibration curves [19][20][21]. To avoid the use of calibration curves for each analysed compound and their mixing, an approach using spectral decomposition in a linear combination of reference spectra was proposed for studying atmospheric corrosion of medieval iron [10]. To go further than using point analyses the corrosion heterogeneities were taken into account using the automated treatment of Raman maps over the corrosion system. This approach was also applied for the diagnostic of self-weathering steel atmospheric corrosion of contemporary work of Art [22].Considering that the intensity of Raman signals are proportional to the concentration, the most used quantification method is the one based on the use of external calibration curves [19][20][21].

        <p>However, it must be pointed out that Raman spectroscopy is poorly suitable for the study of materials featuring high auto-fluorescence emissions. In these cases, the use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is more indicated, since it avoids any problem related to the auto-fluorescence of the sample. Moreover, working with powdered samples, FTIR systems also ensure a better accuracy and repeatability of the results over the sample heterogeneities by sampling the whole corrosion system [23].However, it must be pointed out that Raman spectroscopy is poorly suitable for the study of materials featuring high auto-fluorescence emissions.

        <p>Even though FTIR systems have been successfully applied for the quantification of several kind of liquid [24,25] and solid [26,27] samples, only a few works describe the use of this spectroscopic technique for the quantification of iron phases [28,29].Even though FTIR systems have been successfully applied for the quantification of several kind of liquid [24,25] and solid [26,27] samples, only a few works describe the use of this spectroscopic technique for the quantification of iron phases [28,29].</p>
        <p>Considering that this analytical approach has never been applied in the field of cultural heritage characterization, the main objective of the present work was to evaluate if FTIR spectroscopy can be used as an alternative technique to semi-quantify the main corrosion phases of iron archaeological artefacts. For this purpose, a dedicated software (
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs>) designed by the LADIR group (now MONARIS, Pierre and Marie Curie University, France) was employed to perform the decomposition of FTIR spectra.

        <p>Afterwards, the proposed procedure was also used to assess whether it can be used to reliably assess the stability of real rust samples coming from archaeological artefacts. In this regards, the stability assessment has been inspired by the protection ability index (PAI index), proposed for the first time by Yamashita et al. [30] and subsequently adjusted by Dillmann et al. [7] for the analysis of rust layers covering ancient iron objects exposed to atmospheric corrosion.Afterwards, the proposed procedure was also used to assess whether it can be used to reliably assess the stability of real rust samples coming from archaeological artefacts.

        <p>The main advantage obtained from PAI index calculation consists in helping conservators on predicting the corrosion behaviour of iron artefacts after their recovery from the archaeological site. Thus, objects providing high stability values can be treated and stored by following routine protocols, whereas unstable artefacts require targeted treatments in order to prevent the onset of post-excavation degradation processes. In this context, it is important to clarify that the semiquantification of iron phases involves the sampling/processing of corrosion material. However, this aspect does not represent a remarkable issue since thick corrosion systems are generally removed/thinned in order to recover the original shape of the artefacts [31].The main advantage obtained from PAI index calculation consists in helping conservators on predicting the corrosion behaviour of iron artefacts after their recovery from the archaeological site.

        <p>This work was based on the analysis of both, standard mixtures and archaeological rust samples. In the first case, pure magnetite, lepidocrocite and goethite iron phases (from Sigma-Aldrich corp. St Luis, USA) were kindly provided by D. Neff from the LAPA group (NIMBE UMR3685 CEA/CNRS, France). On the other hand, pure akaganeite was synthesized using the method described by Reguer et al. [32]. The synthesis method involved the hydrolysis of a 0.1 M ferric chloride solution (FeCl 3 •6H 2 O) by heating 2 l of the solution at 70 °C during 48 h.This work was based on the analysis of both, standard mixtures and archaeological rust samples.

        <p>On the one hand, 10 standard mixtures were prepared by mixing iron oxide and oxyhydroxide standards at different proportions. Considering that FTIR spectroscopy needs a small particle size (1-2 μm) to avoid any distortion phenomena, an agate mortar was used for the grinding and the homogenization of all samples. The relative weight of each iron phase in the mixtures was monitored by using an analytical balance (AE200, Mettler) with an accuracy of 0.0001 g.On the one hand, 10 standard mixtures were prepared by mixing iron oxide and oxyhydroxide standards at different proportions.

        <p>On the other hand, real samples were collected from iron artefacts excavated in the Roman archaeological site of Forua (Spain) [33]. This Roman settlement, discovered in 1982, stands just few kilometres inland from the Bay of Biscay.

        <p>In the frame of this study, one rust micro-sample was collected from each of the five nails. The sampling, carried out with the collaboration of the conservators of the Archaeological Museum of Bizkaia, was performed after cleaning the outer rust layer from impurities (e.g. earth, clays and organic material) deposited on its surface during the burial time. In this way, the possible interferences proportioned by extraneous materials during the analytical characterization of the iron corrosion were minimized. The collected samples were finally analysed to semi-quantify the main iron phases and evaluate their stability through the protective ability index calculation.In the frame of this study, one rust micro-sample was collected from each of the five nails.

        <p>For the development of this work two FTIR systems were used. On the one hand, a Jasco 6300 system, operating in transmittance, diffuse reflection (DRIFT, Jasco DR PR0410M) and ATR (diamond crystal with a ZnSe focusing lens, PIKE Miracle™) modes, was used with the aim of checking what configuration provided the most reliable results. The instrument is equipped with a Ge on KBr beamsplitter, a Michelson interferometer and a DLaTGS detector with Peltier temperature control. Analysis were performed in the middle infrared region (from 4000 to 400 cm -1 ) recording 64 scans at 4 cm -1 spectral resolution.For the development of this work two FTIR systems were used.

        <p>After completing the analysis of all samples by using both FTIR systems, the

            <rs type="creator">University</rs>, France) was applied to semi-quantify the detected iron corrosion phases. This program was specifically designed to treat spectra provided by vibrational spectroscopy techniques. 
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs> software automatically performs the semi-quantification of compounds mixtures by the linear combination of spectra of pure reference standards [34,35]. The process consists of two steps. In the first one, the software uses a sum of Gaussian and/or Lorentzian band profiles and a least-square fitting to produce for each reference compound (in this work akaganeite, lepidocrocite, goethite and magnetite) a calculated spectrum that fits the recorded experimental one [36]. The calculations and the fitting procedures performed by 
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs> software have been detailed in a specific publication [37].
        </p>
        <p>In a second step, a linear combination of the calculated standard spectra is used for the fitting of a spectrum similar to the sample spectrum by means of the least-squares criterion and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. After validation of the fitting by the user,

        <p>It is important to recall that the peaks' shape of the XRD diffractogram depends on the crystallinity of the phases (the narrowness of the peaks increase with increasing short and long range ordering).

        <p>To obtain semi-quantitative data from the collected diffractograms, two different softwares were used. Both

            <rs type="creator">PANanalytical</rs>, Holland) apply the Reference Intensity Ratio (RIR) method to predict the phase abundances. Considering that the intensity of a diffraction peak profile is a convolution of many factors, the RIR method measures and reduces to a constant all the factors except concentration to determine phases concentration (by comparison to a reference pattern). Although the softwares are both based on the Reference Intensity Ratio method, the algorithm used for the decomposition of the experimental data is different, which can result in different semi-quantitative results.

        <p>The semi-quantification performed by 
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs> software is based on the decomposition of the vibrational spectrum of a sample by comparison with pure reference spectra. Thus, the first step was focused on the collection of the characteristic FTIR spectra of pure akaganeite, lepidocrocite, goethite and magnetite using the same experimental conditions in order to obtain absorbances (relative intensities between bands) related to each sample specificities, spectrometer characteristics and measurement mode (transmittance, DRIFT, ATR). For example, Fig. 1 reports the FTIR spectra of pure iron phases, collected by using the JASCO 6300 laboratory system in transmittance mode.
        </p>
        <p>As showed in Fig. 1, the magnetite vibrational spectrum was characterized by the presence of strong signals at 588 and 3437 cm -1 (Fig. 1a). Goethite spectrum showed three strong peaks at 615, 798 and 905 cm -1 respectively, together with two broad bands at 3136 and 3431 cm -1 (Fig. 1b). Lepidocrocite spectrum stood out by the presence of a main peak at 1023 cm -1 , followed by several secondary signals at 485, 615, 759, 1152, 3014 and 3414 cm -1 (Fig. 1c). Finally, akaganeite standard provided an intense double peak at 648 and 693 cm -1 , together with two weak signals at 844 and 1623 cm -1 and a broad band at 3385 cm -1 (Fig. 1d).As showed in Fig. 1, the magnetite vibrational spectrum was characterized by the presence of strong signals at 588 and 3437 cm -1 (Fig. 1a).

        <p>As evidenced in Fig. 2, transmittance and DRIFT modes were more sensitive to the OeH bonds vibrations with respect to the ATR mode [38,39], promoting the enhancement of the hydroxide signals on the spectrum of pure akaganeite (3385 and 3470 cm -1 ). This is due to the lesser penetration of the high wavenumber IR lights in ATR mode which result in a smaller volume sampled and then a lower absorbance. As here the ATR spectra were not corrected by the ATR correction function which is commonly provided by the IR software (we choose to not introduce such corrections of spectra) the differences between the ATR profile and the transmittance/DRIFT ones remain. Furthermore, it must be pointed out that, using the DRIFT method, the infrared radiation penetrates the sample/KBr mixture, producing a high number of refractions and absorption processes which result in an enhancement of the intensity in the interfaces contribution, and combination bands [40]. This statement was confirmed by experimental data owing to the presence of several secondary peaks in a wavelength range between 1400 and 3000 cm -1 (Fig. 2). Thus, both position and shape of DRIFT and ATR peaks are more or less shifted/modified because the complexity of the interaction (superimposition of absorption and Fig. 1.

Comparison among akaganeite spectra obtained using the Jasco 6300 system in ATR, DRIFT and transmittance modes. reflection), that explains the differences, especially below 1000 cm -1 [41,42].As evidenced in Fig. 2, transmittance and DRIFT modes were more sensitive to the OeH bonds vibrations with respect to the ATR mode [38,39], promoting the enhancement of the hydroxide signals on the spectrum of pure akaganeite (3385 and 3470 cm -1 ).

        <p>After completing laboratory analysis, the characteristic spectra of pure standards were also collected by means of the portable FTIR Alpha system.

        <p>Once confirmed that both FTIR systems were able to differentiate the iron oxides and oxyhydroxides typically found in archaeological artefacts corrosion systems, the next step of this work was focused on the molecular analysis of the reference mixtures described in Section 2.1. After analyzing all mixtures with the laboratory (transmittance, diamond/ZnSe-ATR and DRIFT modes) and the portable (diamond-ATR mode) spectrometers, the raw spectra were semi-quantified by means of the 
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs> software to determine the contribution of each iron phase in the mixtures. The amount of each iron phase is determined by 
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs> software with the decomposition of each spectrum which provided the weight coefficient expressed as content percentage (Table 1).
        </p>
        <p>As can be observed in Table 1, the semi-quantification reliability of the laboratory Jasco 6300 system varied widely depending on the measurement configuration used. For example, the analysis carried out in transmittance mode ensured concentration absolute errors below 12.7%. On the other hand, the values obtained by using the DRIFT and ATR configurations, provided amounts differences from 0.2 to 19.1% and from 1.2 to 31.7% respectively. Finally, the concentration values obtained through the use of the portable Alpha system in ATR mode showed less reliable results in comparison with the previous cases (errors ranging from 0.1 to 38.2%).As can be observed in Table 1, the semi-quantification reliability of the laboratory Jasco 6300 system varied widely depending on the measurement configuration used.

        <p>The semi-quantification of raw spectra brought to misleading considerations. For example, sample 10 was mainly constituted by akaganeite but, independently of the FTIR system and the configuration used, the 
            <rs type="software">PALME</rs> software assigned the role of main phase to magnetite. As magnetite has the less structured spectrum (Fig. 1) on the whole spectral range, the calculation will use this spectrum just in order to improve the fit quality but not to take into account a specific spectral range/band.
        </p>
        <p>To improve the reliability of the results a focus on the most discriminating part of the spectra is proposed. The range of wavelengths between 500 and 1100 cm -1 was selected as the spectral fingerprint region, since it includes all the main characteristic bands of the analysed iron-based phases and focus on bands specific to each compound (see Fig. 3). In addition, both pure phases and mixture of standards were subjected to baseline correction (see Fig. 3). Hereafter these spectra will be called "treated spectra".To improve the reliability of the results a focus on the most discriminating part of the spectra is proposed.

        <p>Once treated, all spectra were re-processed by means of the

        <p>The new semi-quantification values proved that the use of treated spectra helped to increase remarkably the reliability of the proposed method. The comparison between weighted and experimental values obtained by using the Jasco 6300 spectrometer in transmittance mode showed the most reliable results, providing absolute error values comprised between 0.1 and 7.1%. The values obtained by using the DRIFT and ATR configuration instead, showed absolute errors ranging from 0.5 to 20.8% and from 0.3 to 32.8% respectively. Finally, the semi-quantification values obtained by using the portable Alpha spectrophotometer provided concentration absolute errors ranging from 0.3 to 13.8%.The new semi-quantification values proved that the use of treated spectra helped to increase remarkably the reliability of the proposed method.

        <p>After completing the semi-quantification of all treated spectra, a trend line (including the value of all iron corrosion phases) was constructed for each FTIR mode. The linear correlation between both weighted and experimental concentrations allowed to determine more clearly the reliability of the FTIR-PALME method. By analyzing the obtained trend lines (Fig. 4), several important conclusions can be deduced. First of all, the comparison between Jasco 6300 configurations showed that, as expected, the most reliable results were provided by the use of the transmittance mode (y = 0.9861x, R 2 = 0.9583), because with this procedure bands position and shape are almost not distorted by combination of absorption and reflection phenomena, which are especially important for solids exhibiting electronic conductivity (for instance magnetite). Besides, the comparison between the ATR trend lines proved that the reliability of the portable FTIR (y = 0.9439x, R 2 = 0.8607), after data treating, is comparable to that obtained by the laboratory system (y = 0.9577 x R 2 = 0.8981). As well as to spectroscopic reasons, the higher deviation of the ATR measurements can be due to the significant reduction of the amount of sample measured in ATR mode that could enhance the detection of the samples heterogeneities (originated by the mixing of powders), therefore introducing some dispersion of results.After completing the semi-quantification of all treated spectra, a trend line (including the value of all iron corrosion phases) was constructed for each FTIR mode.

In this way the presence of akaganeite (A), goethite (G), lepidocrocite (L) and magnetite (M) was clearly detected on archaeological (Arch.) Samples 1, 2, 4 and 5. In addition to those, no further crystalline compounds were identified. In the case of Arch. Sample 3, the characteristic signals of lepidocrocite were not detected. Thus, either this iron phase was not present in the corrosion sample or its concentration was below the detection limit of the employed analytical technique. Afterwards, the Xpert Highscore and

In this sense, the reliability of the semi-quantification method proposed in this paper was further demonstrated, except for the Arch. Sample 1. This sample is characterized by a lower akaganeite and lepidocrocite amounts (and also a higher dispersion of their quantification results), and small variations of those oxides will induce big variations of the stability values. When small amounts of reactive or stable compounds are present, then a small numerator or denominator will be used in the stability index calculation and some slight variations in their quantification will introduce high variation of the index.As can be observed in Fig. 7, the stability values provided by the decomposition of Jasco 6300 transmittance and Alpha ATR FTIR spectra fit to those obtained from XRD data.

        <p>Although a reliable stability assessment can only be obtained through the study of several corrosion samples, the results herein summarized attest that the proposed method can be effectively used to establish the stability of iron corrosion systems. This information can play a remarkable role during the planning of the conservation intervention to be applied in the post-excavation phase. Indeed, objects presenting stable corrosion systems (i.e. Arch. Samples 1, 4 and 5) can be submitted to routine conservation treatments, whereas artefacts covered by a reactive rust layer (i.e. Arch. Sample 3) require specific stabilization treatments (such as desalination baths) that minimize postexcavation degradation issues.Although a reliable stability assessment can only be obtained through the study of several corrosion samples, the results herein summarized attest that the proposed method can be effectively used to establish the stability of iron corrosion systems.

        <p>Finally, it must be emphasized that FTIR analyses require a smaller amount of sample (0.3-0.5 mg in transmittance mode) compared to the XRD technique. Thus, this method can be particularly suitable for the study of iron-based objects of cultural interest because the amount of sample that is usually available is very little due to the special characteristic of the cultural objects.Finally, it must be emphasized that FTIR analyses require a smaller amount of sample (0.3-0.5 mg in transmittance mode) compared to the XRD technique.
