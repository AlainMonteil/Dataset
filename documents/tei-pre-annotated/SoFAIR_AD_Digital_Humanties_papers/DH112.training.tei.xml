        <p>This chapter presents the Austrian experience of building CLARINrelated infrastructures and services and describes its impact on the wider humanities research community. We will focus on the activities of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage at the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ACDH-CH), a centre of expertise which now supports projects in a broad range of humanities disciplines. Part of ACDH-CH's services are concerned with research data preservation in the long-term repository ARCHE, which will be elaborated on here, as will a set of text-technological and semantic services. Furthermore, the crucial role of knowledge sharing measures for the increased adoption of DH methods is described and Austrian contributions and cooperation in the context of building European research infrastructures for the humanities are highlighted.</p>
        <p>Over the years, CLARIN has evolved into a lively biotope of national communities which have taken on different forms in indvidual countries (see Hajič et al. 2022 andPetrauskaite ˙ et al. 2022 in this volume). In our contribution, we aim to share the Austrian experience on building CLARIN-related infrastructures and services and to describe their impact on the wider humanities research community. We will elaborate on the special case of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage at the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ACDH-CH) as an example of a central competence centre in the country, which has been firmly rooted in the European research infrastructures CLARIN and DARIAH and has been supporting projects in such diverse fields as religious studies, art history, literature studies, oriental studies, history, archaeology, numismatics, musicology, and archival studies. The ACDH-CH, as a local hub for the deployment of technical as well as social infrastructures, has been acting as the coordinating institution for CLARIN in Austria, with a strong focus on developing adequate digital research concepts and methods, technological frameworks and data models for researchers and scholars in the humanities. Special attention will be given to the data repository ARCHE as the flagship data service in the ACDH-CH's portfolio, which also includes a set of text technology and semantic services. The description of ACDH-CH's role in international cooperations will conclude this contribution.</p>
        <p>The notion of text technology, as used in this contribution, has grown out of many years of practical work at the boundary between modern information technology and a range of text-oriented humanities disciplines, such as the various philologies, literary studies, or history, which were successively applied to other less text-oriented humanities disciplines like musicology, religious studies, or numismatics. To put it differently, in the light of the ongoing digitization efforts in all research areas, text technology constitutes an increasingly important methodological base that is being employed in more and more humanities disciplines. An increasingly important part constitutes semantic tasks, like entity extraction and linking, as well as curating controlled vocabularies and semantic resources, which plays an important role in following the open paradigms and the propagation of linked data.</p>
        <p>This chapter is structured as follows: first, the general setup of the Austrian consortium CLARIAH-AT is described, including its composition and activities. Then the position and activities of the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage as a central hub of expertise in DH in Austria are accounted for, detailing the broad range of services for the DH community and its strong ties with and contributions to the development of European research infrastructures.</p>
        <p>Austria was a founding member of both "Common Language Resources and Technology" (CLARIN, 2012) and "Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities" (DARIAH, 2014) (digital humanities austria 2022), the main representatives of the humanities among the European research infrastructure consortia. Austrian activities that ultimately led to the participation in these consortia can be traced back as far as 2009 (Ďurčo and Mörth 2014: p. 14). In 2013, a three-year project to establish the platform and network digital humanities austria (dha) further fuelled the interweaving of the two research infrastructures in Austria, which by 2014 were already referred to as CLARIN-DARIAH.AT (Ďurčo and Mörth 2014).</p>
        <p>The intertwining of and the many overlaps between the activity areas of and the involved actors behind CLARIN and DARIAH in Austria (Mayer 2020: pp. 36-38) finally led to a merge of CLARIN and DARIAH into the joint initiative CLARIAH-AT, which was formalized as a consortium in 2019. The name CLARIAH-AT was established with the "DH-Austria-Strategie" published in 2015 (Alram et al. 2015). The merging of the two research infrastructures on a national level has found imitators across Europe.</p>
        <p>The CLARIAH-AT consortium brings together key institutional actors, acts as a central hub for Austrian DH activities, and represents the link to the wider international context. Partners of the consortium include the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Austrian National Library, the Universities of Graz, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt, Salzburg, Vienna and the Danube University Krems. The cooperation inside the group ensures maximum synergy and efficiency and is meant to maximize the impact in the Austrian digital humanities research communities.</p>
        <p>In the early years, the research disciplines involved in the activities that developed into the present CLARIAH-AT consortium were very much oriented towards language processing in speech and text. The disciplines included linguistics, artificial intelligence, translation studies and oriental studies (Wissik and Budin 2010). With a growing digital humanities research community, the range of disciplines widened, as illustrated, for example, by the topics at the Digital Humanities Austria conference in 2015 (dha2015), where the GLAM sector was also already present (Hannesschläger 2016).</p>
        <p>CLARIAH-AT is mainly concerned with strategic planning and coordination of the activities of its national partners. The activities are well aligned with those of CLARIN and DARIAH and largely complement them. Furthermore, CLARIAH-AT represents the community's interests with regards to the ministry and other stakeholders. An important achievement in this role was the strategic paper "DH-Austria-Strategie" (Alram et al. 2015), which was co-authored by representatives of the main partner institutions and coordinated by the ÖAW. This document formulates seven guiding principles, each of them with a number of concrete measures. The "DH-Austria-Strategie" serves as a roadmap for the DH community in Austria.</p>
        <p>In May 2021, an update of the strategy in the new paper "Digital Humanities Austria Strategy 2021+. 4 Guidelines for Digital Humanities in Austria" (CLARI-AH-AT Konsortium 2021, digital humanities austria 2022) was released after a commenting period by CLARIAH-AT. It encompasses the following areas: (1) research infrastructures and networks -especially broadening the collaboration with memory institutions; (2) research data -further development of infrastructures for preservation and publication of research data in line with the FAIR Data Principles; (3) digital methods and tools; and (4) education, training, and knowledge sharing activities that accompany the other areas and ensure knowledge sharing and dissemination of results, new tools, and methods. The action plan is congruent with the overarching international activities of CLARIN and DARIAH.</p>
        <p>Members of CLARIAH-AT are actively involved in DARIAH Working groups (ELDAH, DH Course Registry, dariahTeach, Thesaurus Maintenance, and Guidelines and Standards -GiST) as well as in CLARIN groups and committees (User Involvement Group, CLIC -CLARIN Legal Issues Committee, (see Kamocki, Kelli and Lindén 2022 in this volume), Standards Committee, and SCCTC -Standing Committee of CLARIN Technical Centres).</p>
        <p>On the national level, numerous innovative digital projects could be conducted thanks to the go!digital programme, with three calls in 2014, 2016, and 2018.1 The programme was organized by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, financed by funds from the Academy and the Austrian National Endowment for Research, Technology, and Development. A key requirement for funded projects was to be aligned with the activities of CLARIN and DARIAH initiatives. The go!digital initiative was also designed as an incentive for participation of young researchers. In the three rounds a total of 30 projects was selected by international experts. The funded projects were characterized by a particularly high degree of methodological innovation and had a considerable impact on the Austrian research landscape. Furthermore, another 25 active or recently completed projects have been funded by CLARIAH-AT (digital humanities austria 2022). The actors of CLARIAH-AT and the wider Austrian digital humanities community are brought together via the network known as "digital humanities austria" (dha).2 The network organizes conferences for the local community, offers a mailing list and hosts a digital humanities bibliography. An invaluable resource hosted by dha is the database of Austrian digital humanities projects and online resources.3 The project list was significantly updated in 2021 when the dha conference was held as a Twitter conference,4 and currently features over 100 projects. This resource gives an excellent insight into current digital humanities research in Austria.</p>
        <p>Austria is a part of CLARIN's distributed network of centres, with two CLARIN B-Centres (the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage -A Resource Centre for the HumanitiEs at the Austrian Academy of Sciences5 and the ZIM Centre for Information Modelling at the University of Graz6), and two K-Centres (the CLARIN Knowledge Center for Terminology Resources and Translation Corpora, University of Vienna7 and the Phonogrammarchiv -Institute for Audiovisual Research and Documentation -at the Austrian Academy of Sciences8). The history of CLARIN Centres in Austria goes back to 2014 with the CLARIN Centre Vienna (CCV), which began as a repository for digital language resources created in Austria run by the ACDH-OeAW.</p>
        <p>The Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage (ACDH-CH) at the Austrian Academy of Sciences furnishes an excellent example of an institution that developed from text-and language-focused research activities to a broader scope defined by the canon of the digital humanities. The initial focus on language resources broadened into more general digital humanities and data-centric approaches, ultimately extending into the archival and cultural heritage sector.</p>
        <p>In the years from about 2009 until 2014, the CLARIN-and DARIAH-related activities of the Austrian Academy of Sciences were bundled in a working group of the Institute for Corpus Linguistics and Text Technology (ICLTT). The Academy, with its numerous humanities institutes, had a growing need for dedicated capacities and expertise in digital methodolgies for the humanities. The ICLTT working group, already engaged in and connected to the initiatives on the European level, led the efforts to work out a corresponding concept for the Academy. In 2015, this working group became the nucleus of the newly founded "Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities" (ACDH) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, which in subsequent years has grown into a central hub for many infrastructural activities in the humanities at the Academy and in Austria. The ACDH was installed as a research institute with the declared intention of fostering humanities research by applying digital methods and tools to a wide range of academic fields after the Academy had taken over from the University of Vienna as the Austrian coordinating instance in the CLARIN and DARIAH infrastructures in 2014.</p>
        <p>In 2020, having existed for five years, the institute was restructured into three main task areas: Infrastructure and Services, Digital Humanities Research (DH), and Cultural Heritage Research (CH). With the reorganization, relevant research groups originally part of other Academy units were integrated into the institute. Since the restructuring, the institute has been operating under the name "Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage" (ACDH-CH).</p>
        <p>The new structure of the institute was meant to bring together two key areas of the Austrian Academy of Sciences: basic research in long-term projects with a focus on the preservation of cultural heritage, and research on methodological and theoretical aspects of documentation, processing, and visualization in the digital humanities. Within the ACDH-CH, the DH and CH research pillars are expected to increasingly cross-fertilize each other, and thus contribute to the development of joint endeavours on the rich treasure of Europe's cultural memory.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the infrastructure and service unit has been developing a growing portfolio of services: running a repository for digital resources, hosting and publishing data, developing software, and thus contributing to a network of specialized knowledge centres across Europe offering advice and guidance to various research communities.</p>
        <p>The teams at the DH research pillar have been working on research questions with an emphasis on digital editing and text modelling as well as digital knowledge representation. Research projects have been built around questions of the representation, modelling, and analysis of digital text, not only in terms of language, but also in terms of content. Research activities have been situated at the crossroads between well-established encoding methods from digital edition practice (TEI) and the Semantic Web. Digital prosopography has come to play an important part in a number of these projects. Among other tasks, the teams apply semantic tools and Artificial Intelligence (AI) on food images derived from Europeana in order to enhance access to and analysis of cultural data (ChIA9), analyse historical language as an expression of human culture (in the Austrian Baroque Corpus10 as well as the Wien[n]erisches Diarium,11 which covers over 300 issues of the oldest daily news journal still published) and engage in the European Time Machine project.</p>
        <p>The CH pillar of the ACDH-CH mainly pursues long-term encyclopedic and lexicographic undertakings of the Academy dealing with language, music, literature, and biographies with a special emphasis on the Austrian context. In contrast to the infrastructure and DH sectors, where methodological innovation has played an inherently important role, the focus in CH projects has been primarily laid on content creation, like for example lexicographic data (WBÖ -Dictionary of Bavarian Dialects in Austria12), prosopographic knowledge (ÖBL -Austrian Biographical Lexicon13) and reference works (The Austrian Encyclopedia of Music -OEML14).</p>
        <p>The developments in research methodologies and the increased employment of digital methods to address research questions in recent years has created a fast-growing community in various disciplines with an increased demand for digital services. Given the high degree of diversity of requirements, the considerable heterogeneity of data such services deal with, and the limited availability of ready-made solutions, the general approach on the technical side was that of research-driven exploration and experimentation in combination with continuous technology scouting. Over the years, these efforts have lead to the gradual build-up of a robust and broad portfolio of technology stacks and services. Web applications, research software, and tools are all built with reusability in mind, to enable their application beyond single projects. All of the institute's development work is open source licensed. The institute's account on GitHub currently features 303 code repositories.15 Selected examples are detailed below in the section 3.2.2.</p>
        <p>The overall strategy of ACDH-CH is guided by two main principles: the fundamental interconnectedness of infrastructure development and research, and the need for knowledge sharing via a wide range of channels to make the infrastructure accessible and usable for humanities scholars. A number of factors influence the work oriented towards these principles. While the institute has managed to bring together an efficient team with a broad range of expertise, made up of experts who often combine a humanities and technical background in one person, the communication of the importance of hybrid career paths and the accommodation of dedicated positions like "research software engineers" or "data analysts" has remained a challenge in the conservative academic contexts that the Academy represents.</p>
        <p>Building on the methodological and theoretical paradigms of the digital humanities, the dichotomy of service or technology on the one side and research on the other is to be productively dissolved through cross-fertilization between technology and humanities research questions and methods. Through the application of new technologies, the methodological inventory of the humanities is fine-tuned and expanded, while at the same time technical solutions, standards, and best practices are further developed. In this process, the infrastructural work and technological expertise oscillates between testing innovative approaches and providing technologically sound and stable solutions. The technical or infrastructural component is not merely a service that fulfills the wishes and needs of researchers, but also acts as an inspiration and source of innovation in its own right. In this way technology provides important impulses for the methodological sharpening and further development of research methodology that lead to the generation of new ideas and approaches.</p>
        <p>An indispensable prerequisite for this approach of close entanglement in research-driven technological development are the principles of Open Science, not only open access to research results, but also open data for research data, open source for the software developed and used, and open methods for new methodological approaches. In addition, the FAIR Data Principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) as well as the "DH-Austria-Strategie" (Alram et al. 2015) have determined ACDH-CH's strategic orientation to a large extent.</p>
        <p>In our experience, efficient knowledge transfer and continuous educative measures have to accompany the development and provision of methods and tools in order to ensure their uptake by the researchers. The existence of institutions with digital humanities know-how, and in particular the human experts, constitutes an integral part of the development of digital humanities methods and infrastructures.</p>
        <p>Measures for knowledge transfer can be dedicated training events focusing on specific tools or methods, presentations on symposia, engagement with the broader public, or even intensive individual consulting for researchers and research groups. Over the past five years, the ACDH-CH has designed its own series of events, and has participated in numerous workshops and conferences making use of a varied range of presentation formats. Theoretical and practical knowledge has been communicated to researchers and experts as well as to young researchers and the inter-ested public. In addition, reports and information were disseminated via various print and online channels. Details can be found below in the section 3.2.3.</p>
        <p>Individual consulting services for researchers and potential cooperation partners are offered via the ACDH-CH Helpdesk. Consulting has grown into a central tool of service delivery and provides researchers with information and assistance on the topics of digital methods, data management, standards, and legal issues. Ideally, one-on-one meetings with research groups will already have been initiated during the project's proposal phase in order to sound out respective needs, present implementation options, and fathom out relevant technologies and best practices, and thereby also set the course -as early as possible -for an efficient and sustainable technical realization that is in line with the technical infrastructure of the ACDH-CH. Early consultation not only supports researchers during the project preparation phase, but also ensures at an early stage that the technologies and standards to be employed are already in line with best practices in the different research communities.</p>
        <p>Researchers are also supported in regards to systematic and efficient research data management, which is not only one of the main concerns of the ACDH-CH, but is also a requirement in the guidelines of national (FWF 2022) and international (European Commission 2022) funding bodies. Crucial to data management in projects is a data management plan that clearly outlines the various data types and their handling throughout the whole lifecycle of the project, including creation, processing, archiving, and publication.</p>
        <p>The long-term availability of digital (research) data is another core service of the ACDH-CH. It is also one of the most important prerequisites for conducting DH research in conformity with recognized principles such as Open Science (open-scienceASAP 2022, Open Knowledge Foundation 2022) and FAIR data (Wilkinson et al. 2016) and the general rules of good scientific practice (European Science Foundation and ALLEA 2011, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 2019). Longterm preservation and dissemination of research data not only enable data publication, permanent referenceability, and sustainable reusability, but also the reproducibility of research results.</p>
        <p>With the launch of ARCHE (A Resource Centre for the Humanities) in 2017, a service offering digital long-term archiving for the Austrian humanities community was realized by the ACDH-CH. The genesis of ARCHE is described here, and we also cast a spotlight on recent developments.</p>
        <p>The digital archive ARCHE16 serves as an example of how a system initially dedicated to text and language resources was opened and adapted for wider humanities research. ARCHE is operated by the ACDH-CH and is the successor of the first official CLARIN centre in Austria, CLARIN Centre Vienna / Language Resources Portal (CCV/LRP), which was in operation from 2013 until 2017. The CCV/LRP specialized in digital language resources like digital dictionaries, recorded interviews with transcriptions, and language corpora. Its mission was to provide depositing services for and easy and sustainable access to digital language resources in Austria. Its replacement by ARCHE marked the shift towards a repository now available to researchers in all humanities disciplines, with a correspondingly wider range of data types that now includes images, texts, structured and tabular data, audio recordings, videos, 3D models, geographic information and more. Some of these data types can be quite large with regard to their file size and some digital methods lead to a large amount of files. Both factors influenced the design of the repository system and the accompanying workflows.</p>
        <p>In contrast to many Austrian repositories that focus on written research output like articles, ARCHE is one of the few repositories in Austria that accepts research data (Trognitz 2021). In 2017, ARCHE became the first of now three repositories in Austria to be certified with the Core Trust Seal (ARCHE 2018). Of these three certified repositories -ARCHE, 
            <rs type="software">GAMS</rs> and AUSSDA -only the first two accept and host data from the humanities. Both ARCHE and 
            <rs type="software">GAMS</rs> are also certified as a CLARIN Centre B. 
            <rs type="software">GAMS</rs>, the Graz Humanities Asset Management System, has been developed and operated for several years at the Centre for Information Modelling at the Karl Franzens University Graz. This OAIS-compliant system is based on Fedora Commons 3 and builds on a largely XML-based content strategy and numerous system-inherent functionalities for the management and publication of digital data.17 ARCHE's content strategy is file based with extensive accompanying metadata. To enhance sustainability, the use of open access and open data policies is promoted, including the application of the FAIR Data Principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016) to provide Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable data and metadata. Furthermore, principles of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data are applied for metadata management in ARCHE (Trognitz and Ďurčo 2018).
        </p>
        <p>Every resource and collection in ARCHE needs to be described with ARCHE's custom metadata schema. The modelling of this schema faced challenges related to the heterogeneity of data from the wide range of humanities disciplines and the aim of supporting multiple metadata schemas such as the Component Metadata of CLARIN (CMDI) (Broeder et al. 2012, see Windhouwer and Goosen 2022 in this volume), Dublin Core (DCMI Usage Board 2020), DataCite (DataCite 2021) and others (Trognitz and Ďurčo 2018). The current version 3.x of the metadata schema contains 16 main classes, 91 datatype properties, and 39 object properties to describe data collections, their files, and their related entities, such as contributors involved.18 Additional metadata in a dedicated XML-based format for a resource or for the physical object related to a collection or resource can be stored as an additional resource and linked to the respective entities.</p>
        <p>The technical background of ARCHE was initially based on Fedora Commons 4 (Trognitz and Ďurčo 2018). But with the increase of metadata and data, both in numbers and in file size, the design flaws of Fedora Commons 4 had an impact on the stability and performance of the application and even on the consistency of the data. Since the development of work-arounds for the deficiencies was getting out of hand, we had serious technical shortcomings related to metadata management, and none of the available open source repository software solutions provided what we were looking for, in 2020 we decided to develop a software solution from scratch tailored to our requirements: the ARCHE Suite.19</p>
        <p>The ARCHE Suite relies on the use of proven stable and reliable technologies, particularly PHP and 
            <rs type="software">PostgreSQL</rs>, and a more economical use of technical resources. Its design was focused on reusability, both in terms of reusing existing libraries and modules and in terms of reusability by others. The latter is achieved by open-source availability, an extensive and growing documentation,20 a dockerized environment, and easy configurability. The entire code, including the extensive documentation, underwent an external reviewing process before its initial release in 2020. The ARCHE Suite now provides a solid foundation for ARCHE, even for increasingly large data collections.
        </p>
        <p>A unique feature of the ARCHE Suite is that it is metadata agnostic, that is, it does not enforce any particular metadata schema. The only requirement is the metadata is expressed in RDF, which enables compliancy with the Linked Open Data (LOD) principles (Berners-Lee 2010) with five levels (stars) of compliance. The suite has only one built-in metadata consistency check for foreign keys, but more checks can be introduced by implementing custom plug-ins, which can bind to certain events, such as before or after metadata creation, using the language-agnostic Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP21), with bindings to all major programming languages. This flexible yet powerful plug-in system also allows for custom metadata enrichment and synchronization with external services. One service shipped with the ARCHE Suite is the OAI-PMH service, which converts metadata into various XML-based formats via a flexible templating system. For linguistic content ARCHE provides CMDI for the Virtual Language Observatory by CLARIN and for selected cultural heritage content metadata is serialized to the European Data Model (EDM) for Kulturpool, the Austrian aggregator for Europeana. Further output formats are being prepared and will be available in 2022. One will serve the data model of the research infrastructure for archaeology, ARI-ADNEplus. Another will map the ARCHE schema to the dha-ontology,22 which represents the first step of a joint effort by the Austrian initiative CLARIAH-AT to develop a national aggregating catalogue within the project DiTAH.23</p>
        <p>Another key feature of the ARCHE Suite and ARCHE is the use of so-called dissemination services, that is, applications and services that present and deliver specific data types in various presentation forms and formats. Typical examples are the conversion of TEI documents into HTML pages,24 the online preview of a 3D model via the web-based 3D viewer 3DHOP,25 or providing images in different sizes and formats via a dedicated IIIF server.26 These dissemination services allow users to preview the digital objects in ARCHE online and developers can integrate the objects in ARCHE directly into their own web applications by using the endpoints provided by the dissemination services. In fact, a dedicated dissemination service allows the user to pass on individual resources or a set of resources to the Virtual Collection Registry (VCR) of CLARIN, thus allowing for reusing stored resources with resources from other repositories. The mechanism behind the dissemination services, which relies on calling stand-alone services with raw data as a parameter, is compatible with the way the CLARIN Language Resources Switchboard (LRS) works. Thus, configuration efforts are minimized and resources in ARCHE conforming to TEI can already be passed to the LRS.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that a repository like ARCHE is not just a piece of technology, but very much the human curation and interaction that is needed in order to meet high quality standards. Over the last few years, the ARCHE team has worked intensively on documentation, workflows, and policies that aim to make internal processes more efficient, support the researchers, and attain a high level of transparency of procedures. These efforts have been accompanied by outreach activities, workshops, and presentations detailing the deposition process in ARCHE in particular, and highlighting the importance of data preservation and management in general.</p>
        <p>As previously described, the roots of the ACDH-CH go back to the Institute for Corpus Linguistics and Text Technology (ICLTT). Its mission was corpus linguistic and text technological research that included tasks such as development and annotation of text corpora, lexicographical documentation, and fostering the use of standards such as TEI (ICLTT 2013). The methods that are applied to fulfill these tasks are not tied to data from a specific research discipline, which means that data from such diverse disciplines as art history, musicology, oriental studies, history, or archaeology can be processed directly with adjustments to the workflows.</p>
        <p>In digital humanities research, often a textual source stands at the beginning of a research question and requires digitization for automated processing and analysis. The sources may come in the form of a clay tablet, a stone inscription, a historic manuscript, a printed newspaper archive, a handwritten postcard convolute, or a set of audio recordings.</p>
        <p>On the path from the analogue to the digital object, a number of technologies must be applied to make the original source usable in a digital research environment. Automated processes like optical character recognition (OCR) or handwritten text recognition (HTR) or more manual tasks like transcription or double-keying are among the first processing steps, often followed by basic morphological and syntactic analysis tasks such as lemmatization, POS tagging or shallow parsing.</p>
        <p>Once the object is digitized, the content can be semantically analysed with methods like named entity recognition (NER), information and relation extraction, or entity linking. With a growing size of digital datasets and sufficiently clean data, machine learning tasks like classification, clustering, or sentiment analysis can be applied.</p>
        <p>There is a growing range of proven tools for each of these tasks. Therefore, the ACDH-CH's general strategy in this area is primarily to simplify the use of the existing tools, adapt them for specific applications, and integrate them into more complex workflows. These workflows are often characterized by a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods that pair automatic preprocessing steps with digitally supported intervention by experts.</p>
        <p>One of the currently most popular NLP frameworks, Python-based spaCy,27 offers a wide range of pre-built resources, like pre-trained models for numerous languages, specialized components for different NLP tasks, or pre-built pipelines. It has largely replaced traditional tools such as Stanford OpenNLP, treetagger, or Python NLTK and is now used in all projects at the ACDH-CH that have a NLP component.</p>
        <p>After the initial digitization and before analysis, texts often require tokenization. While most NLP toolkits have integrated tokenizers for "plain text", the tokenization of XML/TEI documents while still preserving their structure is a complex task and is not natively supported by any NLP toolkit. Therefore, the specialized application xtx28 was developed at the ACDH-CH for this task.</p>
        <p>A small, but still very useful application is ABBR,29 used as a storage and curation platform to collaboratively maintain abbreviations found in any kind of texts. Those curated abbreviations are exposed through an API so that they can be reused by other projects. This is especially useful as a helper utility for the tokenization task, where unrecognized abbreviations produce erroneous sentence boundaries.</p>
        <p>After tokenization, digital texts can be further annotated and enriched. At the ACDH-CH, TEI is the preferred format for text-based and annotated resources. But many NLP toolkits, like spaCy, usually expect plain text without interweaved annotations as input. To overcome this discrepancy and, more importantly, to convert the result of the automatic annotation process back into a TEI-compliant structure, the experimental application spacyapp30 was developed. It provides a simple user interface and a web service to add linguistic annotations to TEI-encoded files. Users can upload files, which in the background are then sent through several processing steps, tools -among them the aforementioned xtxand corresponding interfaces, until the enriched result is returned, preserving the existing TEI annotation. As part of this development, a Python library for working with TEI data in spaCy was created and released open source.31</p>
        <p>Adding linguistic annotations to TEI-compliant digital documents or curating such annotations can also be done with the tokenEditor.32 This is a web application based on the idea of the table-like data structure traditionally used in corpus linguistics, in which the text is decomposed to one token per line and extended by additional annotation levels as columns. This makes the tokenEditor particularly suitable for checking and correcting word classes and lemma information. The tool is integrated with the federated identity infrastructure of CLARIN, which allows users to log in via their academic user accounts.</p>
        <p>Manual high quality training data is the crucial factor for the quality of machine learning models. At the same time, their creation is very time-consuming and costly. Therefore, it is important to ensure that training data, once created, can be reused as easily as possible. For this purpose, a platform was developed in the NERDPool project to publish and easily reuse training data for Named Entity Recognition.33 Another tool used at the ACDH-CH to support manual creation of training data is the web-based application Prodigy. It integrates with spaCy and allows users to generate production-ready models with a small training set. Although Prodigy at the ACDH-CH is primarily used for annotating named entities, it is very flexible and configurable for a wider range of annotation tasks that include text classification, POS tagging, parsing, or even image annotation.</p>
        <p>Entity linking goes one step further than named entity recognition, by resolving the lexical reference in the text against a semantic reference resource such as dbpedia or Geonames, or the German National Library's Gemeinsame Normdatei. For this purpose, the service enrich34 is provided, which is based on the Apache Stanbol35 framework featuring a RESTful API for entity lookup. Named entity recognition of mentions of persons, places, and other entities, their automatic identification and, if possible, automatic linking to established reference resources, has gained importance in the processing of digital humanities data.</p>
        <p>All these existing or self-developed tools form a diverse suite of tools for digital processing of texts in a continuum from text resources to more structured relational data and further to Linked Open Data (LOD). A logical complement to these processing tasks is the management and handling of semantic LOD resources. Next to a number of triplestores with project-specific datasets expressed in RDF, the ACDH-CH hosts the Vocabs service,36 a platform for publication and management of controlled vocabularies, based on the software 
            <rs type="software">SKOSMOS</rs>,37 implementing the SKOS data model.38 Controlled vocabularies are key to semantic interoperability between heterogeneous data.
        </p>
        <p>A particularly advanced example of integration of text and semantic technologies is APIS -Austrian Prosopographical Information System, a framework for managing prosopographical data, that is, information about persons and their relations to other persons, places and institutions. It was originally developed in the Austrian Prosopographical Information System project (2015-2020), dealing with approximately 18,000 biographies of the "Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950" (Austrian Biographical Dictionary 1815-1950), one of the most visible long-term projects of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In this project the encyclopedic entries, which previously only existed as continuous text, were recorded in structured form and enriched with links interconnecting persons, places, institutions, and events using semantic technologies and automatic methods of named entity recognition, relation extraction, and entity linking. Although APIS was a stand-alone project, both the methods of text analysis and the application for managing the structured data have become integral parts of the ACDH-CH's portfolio of core services and are used and further developed in a variety of thematically similar projects with a prosopographical focus.</p>
        <p>The importance of educational measures flanking the build-up of innovative infrastructures has been gaining more and more attention. Using new technologies usually requires prior knowledge and specialist know-how. This is why effective social infrastructures accompanying technical infrastructures have become a key factor in driving the digital transformation. The highly dynamic developments, a considerable time lag in the development of curricula, and limited resources in the university sector has further added urgency to the issue. It is essential not only to create the infrastructure, but also to empower the target groups to use it.</p>
        <p>As one measure to react to the dichotomy of technological and social infrastructures, a specialized ACDH-CH working group, acting under the title of ERICs and Education, has been focusing on the question of knowledge transfer from the infrastructure specialists into the wider research communities. Special concerns of their work have been data awareness, data stewardship, open research paradigms, the FAIR principles, standards relevant to DH, legal frameworks for research in the humanities, and work with cultural heritage. The group aims to develop a comprehensive set of educational measures, ranging from the creation and provision of relevant materials to outreach and dissemination activities.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the group has been working on the development of tools to facilitate the availability and production of digital teaching materials. The main incentive behind this activity has been to make practice-oriented DH knowledge and methodological skills, which were presented in the manifold lectures, workshops, internships, and other elements, permanently available by documenting the events and creating accompanying digitally available material that remains available in the long run to be re-used later on other occasions and teaching activities. One experimental application that is currently being created is the continuation of an in-house project, the ACDH-HowTo-Blogs. The working group targets groups inside the CLARIAH-AT consortium as well as the wider DH community. As is the case with many ACDH-CH endeavours, they have been striving to embed their activities in larger European frameworks; in this particular case the developments are undertaken jointly with the DARIAH Campus39 endeavour. The intention is to first produce locally relevant material and then to push this to the European level.</p>
        <p>In addition to collecting and curating existing resources, relevant new teaching materials will also be created in a targeted manner, which will be achieved primarily through the "Training" work package of the project "Digital Transformation of the Austrian Humanities" (DiTAH).40 Interactive tutorials about repositories (e.g., ARCHE), metadata, data management, copyright issues, annotations, and NLP, as well as on Semantic Web and Linked Open Data, will be developed by colleagues and experts in the fields.</p>
        <p>The ACDH-CH has also been offering various knowledge sharing event types, like lectures, the so-called Tool Galleries and internships. The lectures serve primarily to connect the local research communities with international DH experts, provide information about their research, and present the latest developments in the field. The Tool Galleries provide practical knowledge through hands-on training on specific DH tools. Both lectures and tool galleries have been offered for several years now, attracting a lot of interest and participation, and some have been planned and organized in close cooperation with universities. They are not meant to be full-fledged courses or parts thereof but rather to complement existing programmes by filling in temporary gaps arising through the dynamicity of developments, turning the spotlight on selected methodological topics.</p>
        <p>It is planned to feed materials created in these contexts into the aforementioned HowTo-blogs. An interesting development over the past two years, with all events being held virtually, has been the extension of the target groups, with increasingly large audiences from abroad.</p>
        <p>An important initiative aimed at reaching out to the next generations of researchers is the ACDH-CH internship programme, which has been running for several years now. It is targeted at prospective young humanities scholars and programmers and systematically familiarizes them with the innovative approaches and methods employed in digital humanities. Interns are invited to participate in a real-world research environment and thus gain experience in working with innovative technologies. Many of the students' interests are language and text-oriented and here they learn for the first time about infrastructures such as CLARIN and DARIAH.</p>
        <p>Through the years, the embedding and involvement of the ACDH-CH and its predecessors in the European research infrastructure consortia CLARIN and DARIAH have represented a central pillar and a permanent international social and technical framework for the infrastructural activities of the institute. The institute's activities have been conceived and implemented in the context of and in close coordination with activities of the CLARIN and DARIAH research infrastructures at the wider European level. Indeed, weaving the network between international and local developments, acting as a broker and centre of expertise ensuring the flow of information and ideas between European and local stakeholders has been at the core of ACDH-CH's mission.</p>
        <p>Correspondingly, the ACDH-CH team has intensively engaged in numerous committees at the European level of these research infrastructures, for instance in the DARIAH working groups Ethical and Legal Issues (ELDAH), Guidelines and Standards (GiST), and Thesaurus Maintenance or in the CLARIN Standards Committee, the Standing Committee for CLARIN Technical Centers, and the CLARIN Legal Issues Committee.</p>
        <p>Among numerous contributions to the central infrastructures, we would like to highlight the early participation in the development of CLARIN's Component Metadata Infrastructure and the Federated Content Search activities, the Vocabulary Repository for publication of controlled vocabularies, as well as the CLARIN Curation Dashboard, which offers important feedback to data providers regarding the quality of their metadata and is described in more detail further below. Furthermore, the DH Course Registry,41 a curated platform that provides an overview of the growing range of teaching activities in the field of digital humanities worldwide (see Wissik, Wessels and Fischer 2022 in this volume), was developed and is hosted and coordinated by the ACDH-CH as a first joint project of CLARIN and DARIAH (Wissik et al. 2020, Schmeer andWissik 2019).</p>
        <p>Another major mode of collaboration are infrastructural EU projects where research infrastructures play an ever-increasing role in pulling together EU-wide consortia out of the pool of established partners and offer a stable base for harmonizing technological developments. Over the years, the ACDH-CH has contributed to numerous projects, mainly: 44 Parthenos,45 ARIADNE and ARIADNEplus,46 ELEXIS,47 SSHOC,48 and most recently InTaVia49 and CLS INFRA.</p>
        <p>All of these activities have created a considerable source of expertise which has in recent years translated into a large number of local and international cooperations. The many cooperative projects have in turn contributed to the spread of know-how into and within the research community. These efforts align perfectly with numerous activities on the EU level, the build-up of EOSC, the FAIRification of data and the focus on training, promising synergetic flourishing exchange of ideas, and sharing of efforts between the numerous stakeholders in Austria and international initiatives to continue in the coming years.</p>
        <p>In the research infrastructure cluster project SSHOC (Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud, 2019-2022),50 the major social sciences and humanities consortia (CESSDA, CLARIN, DARIAH, ESS, SHARE) are collaborating with over 30 other partners to implement the idea of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) for these disciplines. In line with the general idea of EOSC as a "system of systems", that is, a federated, distributed agglomeration of subsystems, SSHOC aims to integrate a variety of existing components and data from the participating partners, focusing on interoperability and reuse.</p>
        <p>The ACDH-CH is involved in three work packages: "WP 3 Lifting Technologies and Services into the SSH Cloud", "WP 6 Fostering Communities, Empowering Users and Building Expertise" and "WP 7 Creating the SSH Open Marketplace".</p>
        <p>The participation in WP 7 continues and culminates the long-standing activities of the institute in metadata aggregation, metadata quality assurance, controlled vocabularies, and resource discovery at the European level. In WP 7, the ACDH-CH is responsible for the implementation of the SSHOC Marketplace,51 a discovery platform for resources, tools, and methods in the social sciences and humanities domain. This platform is one of the strategic goals of DARIAH-EU.</p>
        <p>The system design lays emphasis on curation and quality of information, contextualization of data, that is, capturing relations between items, and engaging the community.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the tasks of the ACDH-CH in WP6, concerned with creating and inventorying existing training materials, align perfectly with the institute's emphasis on knowledge transfer, training, and outreach. One milestone within this task was the creation of a catalogue of training materials and sources relevant to the SSH domain, which is now available as the training toolkit52 (Ďurčo, Illmayer and Barbot 2019).</p>
        <p>In WP 3, led by CLARIN, the ACDH-CH team contributes to tasks revolving around interoperability and service integration. The team is developing a conversion hub, a catalogue of services and solutions for converting metadata between various formats. Another topic in WP 3 towards fostering interoperability is the integration of existing well-established services. This specifically addresses the Language Resources Switchboard (see Zinn and Dima 2022 in this volume) and the Virtual Collection Registry. As described in the section 3.2.1, the ARCHE repository has been successfully integrated with both services.</p>
        <p>The ACDH-CH has been involved in the CLARIN metadata activities (CMDI: Common Metadata Infrastructure; ISO 24622-1:2015) [see Windhouwer and Goosen 2022 in this volume] for many years with a focus on curation and quality assurance. A major long-standing contribution by the ACDH-CH to the CLARIN infrastructure in this regard is the Curation Dashboard,53 formerly known as the Curation Module. It is an application aimed at supporting CMDI metadata authors and curators to evaluate and consequently enhance the quality of metadata for language resources (King et al. 2015, Ostojic, Sugimoto andĎurčo 2017).</p>
        <p>The Curation Dashboard allows users to analyse individual CMDI profiles, individual CMDI records, as well as entire metadata collections with regard to their quality, based on a set of assessment criteria, like facet coverage, validity of links, or descriptive completeness. The Curation Dashboard is used by the repository providers of CLARIN centres all over Europe and especially by the Centre Assessment Committee when evaluating CLARIN centres. A special functionality of the Curation Dashboard is the automated control of the validity of references to resources in the metadata, which was a long-standing desideratum of the CMDI developer community. This component, dubbed LinkChecker, continuously processes the over 1 million metadata records available as part of the Virtual Language Observatory in the background and checks over 6 million links contained within. The results are made available in the statistical analyses of individual collections. They are also fed back into the VLO to provide users with a priori information about the quality and availability of the catalogued research data.</p>
        <p>In this contribution we described how work and research at the ACDH-CH have accordingly been characterized by a clear shift from language-related services for linguistics to a much broader scope in which text technology is being put to use in a wide array of different domains. Examples included the digital long-term preservation service ARCHE and the evolution of text technology and semantic services offered by the ACDH-CH.</p>
        <p>We have also shown the crucial role that knowledge transfer and "social infrastructures" have come to play in the process of introducing new technologies and methods and how the intensified communication and numerous collaborations with partners at universities and other research institutions nationally and internationally have fuelled the evolution of the ACDH-CH into a knowledge hub, on the one hand drawing on the wide-ranging collaborative network as a source of knowledge, new methodological approaches, and innovative technologies, and on the other feeding into this evergrowing network.</p>
        <p>European research infrastructures like CLARIN and DARIAH have provided a reliable framework that allows local activities to be coordinated internationally. They also provide a fertile ground for cross-border collaborations. The ACDH-CH has been acting as a pivot, mediating on several levels -both vertically between researchers and technology providers like data centres or e-infrastructures, and horizontally as a national and international collaborator, bringing researchers with similar or complementary interests into contact. These processes have always been seen as fundamentally transdisciplinary in nature establishing not only new networks of researchers active in different disciplines but also as a stepping stone from which to reach out to parts of society not directly involved with research, such as the educational sector or the interested public.</p>
        <p>In alignment with broader developments in the digital humanities community, we discern two major tendencies for the institute to move along in the foreseeable future: text technology is more and more growing into a mature set of methods being applied in a wide range of humanities disciplines. As language and text constitute a broad common denominator in many tasks and research questions, not only in the narrower field of the digital humanities, these methods have started to spill over into more and more fields of research, fundamentally changing the ways research is being done.</p>
        <p>Another important observation is the fact that semantic technologies have become an integral part of the methodological canon of text technology, representing the bridge from unstructured to structured data. As such, they appear to be a perfect match for a range of traditional humanities disciplines with their deep rootedness in the doctrine of meaning and understanding, and with their concept-based hermeneutical approaches which have posed and will pose particular challenges to many issues of modelling in the digital world.</p>
