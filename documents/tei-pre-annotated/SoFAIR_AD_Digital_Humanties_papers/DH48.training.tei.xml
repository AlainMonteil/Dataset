        <p>Introduction to Digital Humanities Summer Institute Special Issue 2 This collection of essays proceeds from selected presentations shared at the 2017 and 2018 Conference and Colloquia hosted by the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI). Founded in 2001, DHSI is the largest international digital humanities training summit and is hosted annually by the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) at the University of Victoria (British Columbia, Canada). What began as an informal gathering of early-career scholars desiring to build community and learn computational humanities skills has grown into a formal institute drawing over 800 participants each year. DHSI is spearheaded by the ETCL's Director Dr. Ray Siemens, Associate Director Alyssa Arbuckle, and Coordinator Jannaya Friggstad Jensen, and features an international group of nearly 100 expert instructors who teach weeklong courses in a specialized area of digital humanities. Over its 20 year history, DHSI has become an essential (and often cherished) professional development opportunity for many digital humanities practitioners.</p>
        <p>In 2009, the Colloquium was introduced as a collegial outreach event where graduate students could deliver short, lightning-style presentations in order to share their research with the wider DHSI community. With its growing popularity, the Colloquium has since broadened to include all scholars, librarians, and alt-academic principal investigators and computer programmers, faculty members across separate disciplines, and teams of graduate students from unique institutions, alongside other combinations. This diversity not only represents the breadth of the DHSI community, but also reflects the reality of digital humanities practice more broadly. Rarely is a digital humanities project or publication the result of a single researcher's effort. Instead, digital humanities relies on cross-disciplinary collaborations and the labour of many hands-both within and beyond the bounds of the university. Not only are numerous presenters members of collaborative research groups, but the audience also actively engages with the sessions. On several occasions, presenters have enlisted the participation of the audience, such as when John Barber created an impromptu DHSI soundscape. Further, the brevity of the lightning talk format means that presenters are often sharing projects in progress and it has become common practice for audience members to offer substantive feedback, suggest additional research directions, and to chime in with offers for collaboration. Similarly, the single-stream organization of the one-day conference eliminates competition between panel topics and allows all of the conference attendees to participate in an extended dialogue across the entirety of the event.</p>
        <p>These atypical qualities separate the Conference &amp; Colloquium from more standard digital humanities symposia, and continue to make it an attractive and exciting venue for presenters. As an editorial team, we agree that this special issue captures a multitude of voices in syncopation-from different career stages, disciplines, backgrounds, interests, and skill sets. The eclectic mix of essays in this collection characterizes it as both a compelling snapshot of DHSI and a record of the types of innovative research projects, methods, and endeavours being pursued by members of the wider digital humanities community.</p>
        <p>Several of the essays concretely demonstrate how digital tools can be used to enhance humanities research.</p>
        <p>Thana Al-Shakhs provides a compelling and comprehensive account of the value of digital tools for vocal analysis within the broader realm of poetry analysis. Erica Hayes and Kacie Willis introduce eighteenthcentury collector Sarah Sophia Banks and demonstrate how digitally mapping her numismatic holdings--using Neatline--visualizes the powerful networks of the British Empire in a way previously obscured from view. In his paper, John Barber unifies academic and creative approaches. He provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of "soundscapes" and "soundwalking," and their connection to digital humanities. Marieke M. A.</p>
        <p>Hendriksen documents the creation of the ARTECHNE research database and critically reflects on the dataset and interface developed.</p>
        <p>Another collection of the papers showcase how digital humanities methods can highlight marginalized groups, uncover histories, and work towards more inclusive practices. Arun Jacob examines the narrative arcs that survive-and the stories that are absent from-the genealogical history of the field of digital humanities in Taken together, the papers collected here offer a snapshot of the ideas and projects shared at the DHSI Conference &amp; Colloquium. Wide-ranging in scope and approach, we hope each reader can gain a sense of the innovative and important conversations that presenters spark during this annual event. From pragmatic, projectbased inquiries to more theoretical engagements with weighty issues around discipline formation, these proceedings encapsulate the digital humanities as an ongoing, evolving, and multi-voiced field.</p>
