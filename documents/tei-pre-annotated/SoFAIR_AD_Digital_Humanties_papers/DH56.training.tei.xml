        <p>Digital literacy and technology education has gained much relevance in humanities and heritage related disciplines during the recent decades. Against this background, the purpose of this article is to examine the current state of educational programs in digital cultural heritage and related disciplines primarily in Europe with supplemental information from the US. A further aim is to highlight core topics, challenges, and demands, and to show innovative formats and prospects.</p>
        <p>Digital literacy and technologies are becoming increasingly important for researchers in humanities and heritage related disciplines. Scholars have identified the development of combined digital and humanities skills as a critical challenge (Münster, 2019) for the cultural heritage sector, and this is a key issue in the European Commission's Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) priorities for the 2020s (European Commission, 2017, 2019b).</p>
        <p>Cultural heritage refers to traces and expressions from the past that have lasting value in contemporary society (cf. UNESCO, 1989). Cultural heritage traditionally focuses on tangible objects, but a broader understanding that incorporates intangible heritage and computer-based material has gained importance over the last decade. Digital heritage, technically intangible, comprises resources of human knowledge or expression (e.g., cultural, educational, scientific) as well as cultural heritage materials including texts, images etc. which are created digitally or converted into digital form (UNESCO, 2018).</p>
        <p>Although there are many university programs and courses focusing on DHC, there is no comprehensive overview of programs. One reason may be that many programs are driven by traditional fields such as digital archaeology, digital curation or digital conservation as well as related areas as digital humanities (DH) (cf. Münster et al., 2019). Besides higher education, there is a wide spectrum of vocational courses (the EU Codeweek program, DARIAH Teach, PARTHENOS, DHSI, * etc.) and frameworks for training and qualification activities (within ERASMUS+, COST † etc.).</p>
        <p>The purpose of this article is to (a) examine the current state of educational programs, especially at universities in digital heritage and related disciplines to (b) learn about core topics, challenges, and demands. Another objective is to show (c) innovative formats to enable teaching of digital heritage skills. Therefore, the article includes four sections: (A) A sketch of a framework and conditions for DCH education. (B) A discussion of core curricula and competencies in the field of digital heritage that are widely missing in reference to the DH, which have developed comprehensive core curricula at various levels.</p>
        <p>(C) Best practice examples in teaching skills related to DCH, including innovative formats, and a discussion of didactic aspects.</p>
        <p>(D) Future prospects include vocational training and lifelong learning in the field of DCH so that scholars and staff acquire and maintain relevant skills and enabling a wide public to acquire digital competencies via cultural heritage as application scenarios -e.g., via citizen science or crowdsourced repositories and applications.</p>
        <p>In this section, we set the stage for our discussion with an overview of competency frameworks and educational structures framing the teaching and learning of DCH.</p>
        <p>Competency centers are hubs for servicing cultural heritage, for example, by offering technical support, infrastructure, and training. Competency centers have been well established for DH (cf. Risam, 2016) and DCH on national levels, e.g. in Sweden (c.f., Gottlieb, 2012) for more than a decade. Currently, the concept of competency centers is under development to cover the European level with regards to heritage conservation and heritage (European Commission, 2021).</p>
        <p>Competency frameworks provide agreed definitions, descriptions, and implementation methods according to the demands, standards, and guidelines of specific sectors (Corr et al., 2019). (Corr et al., 2019). The main outcome was a SWOT analysis on member state levels (Roche et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Globally, DCH is an emerging field. (Hirsch, 2011) and curriculum development (Locke, 2017), DCH education in the EU is more comprehensive, with more concrete efforts at standardizing competencies than in the US.</p>
        <p>Core curricula as an overarching body of knowledge and competencies in a specific domain sum up conditions for learners, learning processes, and outcomes, and therefore define requirements for education. They record competencies for students in several sectors (subject-specific, social, etc.) and show the content of modules and their objectives. Furthermore, they point out organizational aspects and offer methods for university teachers to design courses that achieve desired learning outcomes. These outcomes include appropriate digitization processes related to teaching, learning, and curriculum development. Within DH and DCH, emerging methodological and technical changes continue to greatly impact the development of core curricula (Schulz, 2018). In particular, the wide array of digitization techniques require transformations not only in digital content but also in teaching digital pedagogy and curricular-based digital skills (Grünewald, 2020).</p>
        <p>Data literacy is defined as the ability to handle data in an organized manner, use it consciously, and question it in context (Schüller et al., 2019). This definition comprises competencies regarding the collection, exploration, management, analysis, and visualization of data but also to its interpretation, contextualization, evaluation, and application. Data literacy is a major prerequisite for scientific work and should therefore be a fundamental part of the training of all university students from an early stage. In recent years, universities have increasingly implemented data literacy courses and programs, but with different organizational structures and thematic foci. Programming is a mandatory part of some of the data literacy programs. Other topics are highly dependent on the departments involved in organizing the respective programs. Several of the programs offer multiple levels so that the entrance threshold is low, but interested students can extend their data handling skills.</p>
        <p>Courses to achieve higher levels can either be specific and centrally organized (often in the form of workshops, training, or project-based courses) or students can select from a range of topics. Most programs award certificates for successful participation. In many cases, credit points from courses in the certificate programs can be used for the actual study program, which generates an additional incentive for students to participate in the certificate course and makes it attractive for students who are not required to complete a data literacy program.</p>
        <p>Apart from creating special courses, many data literacy projects support lecturers in teaching data literacy competencies in their courses. Thus, the respective data literacy skill is directly connected to discipline-specific topics and students do not have to expend any additional effort.</p>
        <p>Researchers have attempted to sum up and categorize DH programs, syllabi, and core topics. Sahle (2013) These approaches also mention the importance of teaching content, methods, and skills in combination with practical formats like case studies, projects, or evaluation (Sahle, 2013). The latter is linked to project-based-learning (cf. Kröber and Münster, 2014) that is common in DH, which foster student creativity, problem-solving skills, collaboration, and independent learning (Spiro, 2011).</p>
        <p>Core competencies in DH include research skills (e.g., information research and management), foreign language skills, general humanities methods, and specialist DH methods (Sahle, 2013). Analytical skills stem from the fields of ICT, data management, programming, digital editions, statistics, or technologies for creating websites (Schulz, 2018). DH courses therefore address the width of humanities research data, as well as their manipulation and modeling, handling, presentation, and interpretation (Grünewald, 2020). Additional, more advanced abilities in the DH curriculum incorporate modeling and analyzing questions and subsequently transforming them into technically supported solutions to provide a wider understanding of the research field, including practical applications (Sahle, 2013;Schulz, 2018). In those curricula, subject-specific knowledge concerning tangible and intangible heritage merges with knowledge of standards or tools that directly imply a connection to certain research questions or areas.</p>
        <p>Numerous professional disciplines are engaged with cultural heritage and its digitization. Consequently, various and highly differing skills and competencies are needed, which has drastically changed in the digital age. A spectrum of DCH competencies comprises digital data curation, communication, and tool skills (Van Lakerveld et al., 2017). Although digital competencies are essential for heritage professionals at all career stages (Münster, 2019), training in digital heritage is still mostly provided through academic courses and curricula.</p>
        <p>How is the situation in related fields? Competencies in cultural heritage education are described in several publications -most recently (Jagielska-Burduk and Stec, 2019), previously in (Chen et al., 2012) and by (Tammaro, 2017) Sabharwal, 2015) and investigated within the DigCurV Curriculum Framework (Cushing and Shankar, 2019;Engelhardt, 2012). Although these frameworks target similar sets of competencies, they do not focus directly on DCH.</p>
        <p>Within Europe there are several opportunities to study digital heritage. For this article, options at bachelor's, master's, and doctoral level were examined using study portals -the three European platforms * within a partnership with institutions like the EC, DAAD, British Council, and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning that provide prospective students from all over the world a curated review of study courses. For DCH, we do not claim that these results are complete but sketch an overview of possibilities for studying DCH in Europe. † More than half of the DCH education options in Europe comprise a master's degree (a total of BA: 119, MA: 136, PhD: 12). One possible reason for this could be the strong orientation toward research in heritage fields combined with digitally based infrastructures. As (Busch, 2020) points out, digital methods are primarily used in research settings, which is more relevant at master's level than in bachelor's programs (Fig. 1). The countries in Europe ‡ where DCH or related subjects are studied are Austria, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. The UK offers the largest number of DCH programs and is unique in that the majority are at the bachelor's rather than the master's level (cf. Fig. 2). In European countries, bachelor's programs are minimal or unavailable (e.g., Sweden or the Netherlands).</p>
        <p>At all levels, DCH is mostly connected to humanities disciplines (total 141); arts, design, and architecture (total 83); and social sciences (total 79). In addition, applied sciences, business management, computer science, and IT, hospitality, leisure and sports as well as journalism and media are relevant subdisciplines where DHC is assigned (Fig. 3).</p>
        <p>In the next section this article will have a closer look on the three domains from which where the largest number of DCH courses originate. For DCH courses related to the humanities, the most frequent discipline is history, specifically modern and ancient history. In the language-related fields, language and literature studies and linguistics are the most represented disciplines (Fig. 4). Within the domain of arts, design and architecture, visual arts, film, photography, and media, DCH courses primarily relate to art history, architecture, and design (Fig. 5). In the context of social sciences DCH courses focus on urban and cultural studies and archaeology (Fig. 6). With regards to the different types of cultural heritage, European DCH programs mostly focus on tangible heritage, that is, artifacts, objects, images, and texts. Correspondingly fewer DCH programs focus on intangible, natural, or born digital heritage, including video games, music, theater, dance, religion, or spirituality.</p>
        <p>Research-based teaching formats encourage learner participation and offer real-world learning opportunities (Brew and Saunders 2020). In recent years, digitally based teaching and learning formats continued to expand to all fields of study (Keengwe and Kidd, 2010). In DH and DCH, students encounter diverse range of formats. purposes. * On the other hand, courses for DH and DCH educators are offered to widen their specific teaching skills via digital formats. † Self-study for both students and educators is frequently based on wikis, blogs, and text, audio, or video lectures. Selfstudy material can stand alone or become part of teacher-driven DH and DCH courses (e.g., Münster et al., 2021;Openculture, 2021;PARTHENOS, 2020;Volk et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Tutorials are becoming increasingly popular as a self-study format. They are expected to become one of the most used techniques in education (MMB, 2020) because they provide theoretical and practical information that can often be archived for future needs (Bergert et al., 2018). In DH and DCH education, screencasts are often used to convey digital methods and the use of software (e.g., forText). ‡ They employ step-by-step visualization of applications and software tools to provide students with practical instructions that are embedded in the processing of specific questions and research problems. One example is the Digital4Humanities project § coordinated by Friedrich Schiller University Jena and supported by the Association of Digital Humanities in the German speaking countries. In the project, researchers from eight German and US universities are investigating the use of video tutorials for learning digital research methods in a self-directed way. Various tutorials have been created. Each tutorial comprises the theoretical aspects of a specific research method, explains the relevant methods or tools, and implements them in a practically oriented research context. The tutorials also show students how to handle the software tools on a step-by-step base. One objective of the project is to make the results available to other researchers, lecturers, or educators that want to create self-study tutorials.</p>
        <p>Another objective is to evaluate the tutorials with lecturers and learners to retrieve empirically based information about this selfstudy format.</p>
        <p>While video tutorials address students in an active and inclusive manner and enable informal education, various formats are used to enhance formal education. One setting originally employed in secondary schools (King, 1993) and subsequently in universities (Spannagel, 2010) is the flipped or inverted classroom. In this setting, the learning phases are swapped. Students first learn individually and then come together with the teacher and peers for group learning. Class time is used for active problem-based learning and practice activities (Love et al., 2014). In fully digitally based settings, individual and group learning take place virtually.</p>
        <p>A digital approach opens new avenues to connect the inverted classroom with other approaches such as cooperative or collaborative learning (eg. Kopp and Mandl, 2006) in virtual environments. A recent survey showed that in fully digital settings the flipped classroom approach can have a positive effect on students' learning, attention, and evaluation of learning (Tang et al., 2020). In DH and DCH education another benefit of such settings is virtual collaborations at national and international levels. The close connection between education, research, and professional tasks (Sonntag, 2021) is also relevant for DH and DCH. Collaborative formats using problem-based learning (PBL) (Barrows, 1996) promote active engagement with the learning material, which helps learners to remember concepts and skills and promotes problem-solving competencies (Adobe, 2021). PBL is carried out in small tutorial groups under supervision and engages § https://www.gw.unijena.de/fakult%C3%A4t/juniorprofessur+f%C3%BCr+digital+humaniti es+(bild_objekt)/projekt+digital4humanities, June 23, 2021. Radianti et al., 2020). These applications are designed to best ensure the transformative power of experiential learning and to enable integrated research and training activities. Through these solutions, it is possible to actively involve students, often resulting in faster learning, better retention, and better decisionmaking, as well as to provide researchers with advanced tools for study and analysis (Jing, 2019;Kencevski and Zhang, 2019).</p>
        <p>The current state of DH and DCH education, core curricula and competencies, and formats offer a foundation for future teaching and learning requirements.</p>
        <p>Strong self-directed learning cannot thrive without organizational support (Traus et al., 2020). Students need to know how to manage learning in this way (University of Michigan, 2020). This approach could be implemented in curricula or at least in key qualifications, particularly important for nurturing scientific skills (Sahle, 2013) as a core competence for studying and research.</p>
        <p>Linking Primary, Secondary, and Higher Education Within several frameworks (Ferrari, 2013;Gesellschaft für Informatik, 2016;Redecker, 2017), it has already been pointed out that learning, working, and living are closely connected. Due to digitization, life is changing rapidly, and it is essential to evolve concepts of teaching in response to this phenomenon. As an example, the European Heritage Strategy for the 21st Century (Council of Europe, 2018) mentions the need to incorporate heritage education into school curricula. As such, virtual learning locations could connect schools, universities, and institutions or organizations and give galleries, libraries, archives, and museums the chance to interact with target groups at different educational stages.</p>
        <p>In addition to subject-specific and general key qualifications, some superior frameworks record overarching digital competencies (e.g., for lifelong learning, Council of the European Union, 2018). For example, the Italian national plan for the digitization of cultural heritage (Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism, 2017) aims to provide the multiple offices operating in cultural heritage with a model for managing digitization processes, to accelerate their development, and to facilitate access to the services offered. From this perspective, the plan should be understood as a management system of the digital ecosystem of cultural heritage that comprises general organizational and operational methods, definitions for tools, and methods of verification. To meet the needs that emerge from the launch of high-impact initiatives such as this Italian one, or to respond to the requests that come from operators and professionals in museums and public institutions, numerous transnational initiatives have been taken, such as those proposed by Una Europa Life Long Learning Certificates (4 ECTS). † They aim to provide a truly transnational learning environment where individual courses offered by the Una Europa partners ‡ are mutually recognized as building blocks of a joint program, including lifelong learning in DCH as digital technologies applied to cultural heritage, management of digital data, and digital data services for study, research, and management.</p>
        <p>Finally, citizen science approaches have found their way into the research and teaching of various university disciplines in recent years (Bonney et al., 2009), including DCH. In this context, knowledge transfers to citizen scientists creates particular didactic challenges (Roche, 2020). This is not least because the target or interested group for cultural heritage projects are often not digital natives and thus have to be addressed via other channels (Haumann and Smolarski, 2021). Knowledge transfer via digital citizen science activities nevertheless appears to be a promising approach, as public involvement in generating knowledge increases willingness to engage with cultural heritage. From a university perspective, getting an interested public from outside the academic institution involved in the research process is promising. This involvement can not only integrate previously inaccessible knowledge stocks, but also opens up new perspectives and interdisciplinary problem-solving approaches at the various levels of participation -from crowdsourcing to citizen science.</p>
        <p>type (e.g., certificate, degree), and approach (fixed vs. agile) (Richards-Rissetto and Wisnicki, in print). While degrees in DH are offered, most educational programs comprise specializations, minors, concentrations, and certificates. As for DCH, there are no degree programs in the US, and formalized programs, such as the Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST), University of Arkansas, ‡ are almost absent. In part, the lack of DCH degree programs and standardized pedagogical learning objectives stems from debates about what digital humanities is, as well as from disciplinary diversity (Gold, 2011).</p>
        <p>However, DCH education is growing in the US. New courses, field schools, and specializations are particularly associated with digital archaeology, history, and/or library sciences and museum studies. For example, John Hopkins University offers an MA combining cultural heritage management with a Certificate in Digital Curation emphasizing archival methods. In contrast, digital archaeology programs typically emphasize field methods such as terrestrial and aerial laser scanning and photogrammetry, and other technical skills such as Geographic Information Systems. DCH courses range from introductory to advanced, with diverse foci, and a lack of common pedagogical standards. While organizations, institutions, and funding agencies are increasingly focused on DH and DCH pedagogy</p>
        <p>* This course introduces entrylevel students from all disciplines to programming and statistics to work hands-on with real-life data. While universities in Germany have implemented data literacy in curricula in various ways, most programs encompass centrally organised, interdisciplinary courses intended for early-stage students. Adhering to recommendations from several studies on data literacy education (Arbeitsgruppe Curriculum 4.0, 2018; Gesellschaft für Informatik, 2018;</p>
        <p>Heidrich et al., 2018;Ridsdale et al., 2015)</p>
        <p>, these courses typically include hands-on work with data similar to Data8. The programs often use lectures to raise awareness and give students an overview of the different aspects of data literacy. Complementary online courses or exercises may be used to provide additional information. More extensive modules (5-10 ECTS) on data literacy are less commonly used as a starting point. Main topics include programming, the basics of computer science, statistics, research data management, and ethical aspects of the work with data, as well as topics related to the application and the social impact of data and digitalization.</p>
