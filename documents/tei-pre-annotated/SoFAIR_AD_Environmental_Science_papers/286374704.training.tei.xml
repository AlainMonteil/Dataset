        <p>Objective The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use compared with non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette smoking. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases, and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts. study selection All studies of young people (up to age 30 years) with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of smoking where an OR could be calculated were included (excluding reviews and animal studies). Data extraction Independent extraction was completed by multiple authors using a preprepared extraction form. Data synthesis Of 9199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among nonsmokers and later smoking (OR: 4.59, 95% CI: 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a randomeffects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I 2 =88%). Conclusions Although the association between ecigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.Objective The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use compared with non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette smoking.

        <p>Existing evidence suggests that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is less harmful than smoking 1 and is an effective smoking cessation aid 2 ; however, there are concerns that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking cigarettes among young people. If this is correct, rather than seeing a decline in smoking rates we may see smoking rates remaining stable or increasing due to a new generation of smokers for whom e-cigarettes have acted as a route into smoking. This hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the 'gateway hypothesis' or 'catalyst model') has been widely debated among researchers and public health officials. Some argue that a common liability better explains the association between vaping and later smoking, whereby the same genetic or environmental factors that increase the likelihood of someone vaping also increase the likelihood of someone smoking. 3 As many people use e-cigarettes to help them stop smoking, it would also be logical to assume the opposite direction of causality with smoking causing people to vape. 4 The lack of consensus on the issue demonstrates the need for the current evidence to be synthesised.Existing evidence suggests that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is less harmful than smoking 1 and is an effective smoking cessation aid 2 ; however, there are concerns that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking cigarettes among young people.

        <p>One systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between baseline e-cigarette use and later smoking concluded that e-cigarette use was associated with an increased likelihood of smoking at the follow-up. 5 Although this meta-analysis is relatively recent, this is a fast-moving field with a substantial number of relevant studies having been published since 2017. Given the topic is of great interest to researchers and policy-makers, an updated meta-analysis is necessary. Moreover, in the previous meta-analysis, 5 moderate heterogeneity was observed between the study results. Some potential sources of heterogeneity could include the age range of the participants in the studies and the risk of bias among the studies. Soneji and colleagues 5 addressed this by stratifying by average age, finding that there was greater heterogeneity between studies of adolescents (under the age of 18 years) compared with studies of young adults. However, they did not stratify by the risk of bias. This is important because the preconceptions of study authors may also influence how studies are designed and conducted, and this may be reflected in a study's conclusions. For example, two studies in the Soneji and colleagues 5 meta-analysis drew diverging conclusions, despite the pooled ORs not differing substantially from each other. Leventhal and colleagues 6 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the gateway hypothesis, whereas Miech and colleagues 7 concluded that there was a one-way bridge from e-cigarette use to smoking, despite both studies having similar results.One systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between baseline e-cigarette use and later smoking concluded that e-cigarette use was associated with an increased likelihood of smoking at the follow-up. 5 Although this meta-analysis is relatively recent, this is a fast-moving field with a substantial number of relevant studies having been published since 2017.

        <p>In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated and extended previous reviews in which e-cigarette use and later smoking have been explored while looking at a broad range of evidence. Our aim was to investigate whether e-cigarette use, compared with non-use, in young nonsmokers is associated with subsequent cigarette use by combining evidence from studies investigating e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking where an OR could be calculated.

        <p>Using Bradford-Hill criteria, we selected four criteria that were relevant to the studies of interest to indicate the strength of evidence of a possible causal relationship between our exposure and outcome (see the online supplementary material for more details). These were: strength of association, specificity, temporality and dose responsivity.

        <p>In terms of observed exposures, most studies explored ever e-cigarette use with never e-cigarette users as a comparator. Two studies looked at current users with not current users as the comparator 7 10 and two looked at both current and ever use. 11 12 Only one study considered the amount of exposure to nicotine, 13 and one study looked at the frequency of e-cigarette use. 14 In one study that took nicotine use into account, 13 two separate analyses were conducted for: (1) ever use of nicotine containing e-cigarettes (OR: 11.90, 95% CI: 3.36 to 42.11); and (2) ever use of non-nicotine containing e-cigarettes (OR: 5.36, 95% CI: 2.73 to 10.52). However, the analysis groups were not mutually exclusive (ie, an individual would have been in both analysis groups if they had tried both nicotine containing and nicotine free e-cigarettes). No analysis was reported using subgroups of exclusive nicotine or nicotine-free use. The one study which addressed the frequency of e-cigarette use 14 found that those who had used e-cigarettes at varying frequencies from one time or two times (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.96 to 4.22) to weekly/daily (OR: 4.09, 95% CI: 2.43 to 6.88) were more likely than those who had not used e-cigarettes to have smoked at least once at follow-up.In terms of observed exposures, most studies explored ever e-cigarette use with never e-cigarette users as a comparator.

        <p>positive association. The main findings were consistent with the findings of Soneji and colleagues, 5 whereby there was a strong positive association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking and a high degree of heterogeneity between studies. Similar to Soneji and colleagues, 5 stratification by age revealed slightly lower pooled estimates for the odds of smoking in studies that excluded those under the age of 18 years compared with studies including them. Stratification by location indicated stronger associations in the UK compared with the USA and other countries. We identified an additional 11 studies that were not included in the Soneji meta-analysis. One study that was included in the Soneji and colleagues meta-analysis 5 was not included in this meta-analysis; it was substituted for more recent evidence using an overlapping dataset. 23 In addition, one conference abstract was substituted for the published article. 24 Three of the four preselected Bradford-Hill criteria (strength of association, temporality and specificity) were commonly rated as having been met in the included studies. Despite the high heterogeneity statistics, the included study estimates are consistently in the same direction and there are plausible causal pathways (eg, nicotine addiction, similar hand-to-mouth actions for both behaviours). This suggests that the results provide some support for a causal relationship between e-cigarette use and later smoking. This is in line with the theory that e-cigarettes act as a gateway to smoking. 3 25 Commonly in the literature, the claim is that the gateway effect is attributable to nicotine addiction. 25 E-cigarettes have historically not delivered nicotine as effectively as cigarettes, 26 so that e-cigarettes may not be adequate to satisfy users who become more heavily addicted to nicotine. 27 In contrast, the common liability theory proposes that people who use multiple drugs (or in this case different delivery methods of the same drug) share the same predisposing factors. 28 When considering a causal relationship between e-cigarette use and later smoking (eg, the gateway hypothesis), these shared factors/confounders (ie, the common liability theory) should be taken into account. Due to a lack of consideration of such factors in the included studies, we have some reservations about inferring a causal relationship. We discuss our reservations below with respect to Bradford-Hill criteria for causality, highlighting the need for additional research that may help to strengthen the evidence for a causal relationship.positive association.

        <p>The majority of studies included in the meta-analysis satisfied the temporality criterion. All studies except one were longitudinal and measured exposure prior to smoking and smoking at follow-up; therefore, the observed association between earlier e-cigarette use and later smoking is unlikely to be due to reverse causality (ie, smoking leading to e-cigarette use). However, smoking status is sometimes misreported by young people, 29 meaning that some self-reported non-smokers at baseline may in fact have smoked previously. If ever smokers misreport their smoking history at baseline, but they accurately report that they are ever smokers at follow-up, the association could be biassed away from the null. Self-reports were validated in one study 30 using breath carbon monoxide levels; however, with the short half-life of breath carbon monoxide (4-6 hours), this measure is not suitable to validate self-reports of ever smoking. In future research, the use of biomarkers that can identify long-term exposure could help researchers to objectively confirm selfreported smoking status at baseline. Differential DNA methylation signals have been observed among smokers compared with non-smokers 31 32 and it is plausible that different signals would be observed among e-cigarette users. Eventually, researchers may be able to use these methylation signatures to exclude people who misreport their behaviour. Consequently, researchers could more confidently dismiss reverse causation as an explanation for the association.The majority of studies included in the meta-analysis satisfied the temporality criterion.

        <p>It is also worth noting that our measure of specificity was relatively liberal. We rated studies as specific if they adjusted for more than basic demographic factors. In a recent cross-sectional study, accounting for shared risk factors fully explained the relationship between e-cigarette use and current smoking, demonstrating the importance of adjusting for potential confounders such as alcohol and drug use, peer smoking and risk-taking behaviour. 33 In addition, some potential confounders, like impulsivity, are difficult to fully capture via self-report and are often assessed relatively crudely. Had we considered only studies adjusting for behavioural risk factors (eg, alcohol and marijuana use) to meet this criterion, only six studies would have been rated as specific. Adjusting for these factors considerably reduced the OR and/or widened the CI compared with the unadjusted analysis. As statistical adjustment can never fully remove the risk of confounding, other approaches to exploring the potential for a common liability (eg, to risk taking) explaining the observed association between e-cigarette use and smoking are warranted. One way of exploring specificity of this relationship more thoroughly (which none of the included studies did) would be the use of negative control outcomes (ie, outcomes that have similar confounding structures to smoking but for which there is no biologically plausible mechanism for e-cigarette use being a causal factor). For example, using an e-cigarette is unlikely to cause other risky behaviours such as the number of sexual partners a person has; if similar associations are seen between e-cigarette use and both smoking and number of sexual partners, it would indicate that the link may be caused by common underlying factors. Furthermore, exploring the genetic aetiology of e-cigarette use may help in understanding whether e-cigarette use and smoking share a common liability. If e-cigarette use has a shared genetic aetiology with negative control outcomes for which there are no plausible pathways through which e-cigarette use would be a causal factor (eg, gambling), this would suggest that the association is due to the two behaviours sharing a common genetic liability. The triangulation of evidence obtained using different methods will be critical here. 34 To meet the final pre-selected Bradford-Hill criterion, doseresponse, increased e-cigarette use should lead to greater risk of later smoking. Despite the most likely causal pathway from e-cigarette use to later smoking being via nicotine addiction, 3 only one of the included studies measured and took into account the nicotine content of the e-cigarettes used. This study indicated that both use of nicotine containing e-cigarettes and (to a lesser extent) non-nicotine containing e-cigarettes are strongly associated with later smoking. 13 This suggests that nicotine exposure may be one factor in the association between e-cigarette use and later smoking, but not the sole mechanism. Unfortunately, the study reported analyses based on nicotine versus non-nicotine vaping in which these two groups were not mutually exclusive (ie, individuals would be in both analysis groups if they tried both nicotine containing and nicotine free e-cigarettes). Thus, it is unclear whether there is an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking when users have not been exposed to nicotine. To determine whether there is a nicotine dose-response involved in the association, we would also need to observe the frequency of e-cigarette use prior to smoking. The one study that looked at frequency of use (at four levels) indicated that there may be a dose-response to nicotine when comparing use just one/two times with use weekly/daily. 14 However, the odds of later smoking did not increase linearly with each increased level of frequency of use.It is also worth noting that our measure of specificity was relatively liberal.

In adolescence, risk-taking is common 35 and decision making for health-risk behaviours is influenced by peers, societal influences and parental monitoring, but these factors are less influential to adults. 36 Such factors are likely to be confounders of the association between e-cigarette use and later smoking, particularly in studies of those under the age of 18 years and should be included as covariates where possible. The results stratified by location also suggested there may be societal influences on the association; the association was stronger among studies based in the UK than those based in the USA.

        <p>In conclusion, there is a strong consistent association in observational studies between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking. However, findings from published studies do not provide clear evidence that this is explained by a gateway effect rather than shared common causes of both e-cigarette use and smoking. This emphasises the need for a scientific forum to discuss the evidence to date and directions for future research. Future research should consider including relevant potential confounders, such as better measures of impulsivity and other measures of propensity to risk taking, and objective measures of smoking status in order to better explore the potential role of e-cigarettes as a gateway to smoking. Studies that explore the genetic underpinnings of these behaviours and use negative control outcomes may also help improve our understanding of the association between e-cigarette use and later smoking. A scoping review, including qualitative evidence, could provide a clearer understanding of the why e-cigarette use is associated with later smoking. Importantly, any recommendations regarding e-cigarette regulations to limit the burden of future smoking must consider the potential beneficial impact of e-cigarette use on smoking cessation. 37In conclusion, there is a strong consistent association in observational studies between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking.
