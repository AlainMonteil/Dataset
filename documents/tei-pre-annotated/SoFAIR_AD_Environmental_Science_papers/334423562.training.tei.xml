        <p>Urban water demand prediction based on climate change is always challenging for water utilities because of the uncertainty which results from a sudden rise in water demand due to stochastic patterns of climatic factors. For this purpose, a novel combined methodology including, firstly, data pre-processing techniques were employed to decompose the time series of water and climatic factors by using Empirical Mode Decomposition and identifying the best model input via tolerance to avoid multi-collinearity. Second, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was optimised by an up-todate Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA-ANN) to predict the medium term of the stochastic signal of monthly urban water demand. Ten climatic factors over 16 years were used to simulate the stochastic signal of water demand. The results reveal that SMA outperforms Multi-Verse Optimiser andUrban water demand prediction based on climate change is always challenging for water utilities because of the uncertainty which results from a sudden rise in water demand due to stochastic patterns of climatic factors.

        <p>For the mentioned reasons, freshwater scarcity is a classic problem for policymakers [1,2]. Recently, the World Economic Forum confirmed that water scarcity is one of the largest international risks because of the limited amount of accessible freshwater (approximately 0.014% of the total amount of water on the planet of Earth). In addition, climate change, water pollution and poor management of freshwater sources are other major factors that contribute to water scarcity. For example, climate change increases water demand that increases the pressure on the urban water system, especially during periods of water shortage. Accordingly, water companies must devise strategies to tackle this issue. Hence, water utilities should support and enhance the management of the municipal water system [3][4][5].For the mentioned reasons, freshwater scarcity is a classic problem for policymakers [1,2].

        <p>Hemati, et al. [6] reported that, during the period from 1930 to 2009, Melbourne City experienced two short-term droughts and three long-term droughts (the last one was from 1997 to 2009). As a result, annual rainfall was adversely affected, making its influence on the municipal water supply system keenly felt. In addition, Roy and Majumder [7] stated that hazardous weather events, such as heatwaves in Australia, are likely to be more regular or extreme, leading to alterations in the amount of freshwater available.Hemati, et al.

        <p>In the last few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the effects of climate change on the demand for freshwater. Although data from several sources have identified that the increase of urban water demand is associated with climatic factors, researchers have not looked at the variability of climate change in much detail. Therefore, to date, the impact of climate change on urban water demand has still not yet been extensively investigated. Consequently, the uncertainty in water sustainability has increased due to the lack in the knowledge about the impact of climate change on the demand of water [8].In the last few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the effects of climate change on the demand for freshwater.

        <p>A review of different municipal water demand modelling techniques over the past few decades, [5,[13][14][15][16], highlighted various issues that include: 1) Most of these methods and techniques were focused on the prediction of short-term water demand, and little research has considered medium-to long-term urban water demand. 2) Different artificial intelligence techniques were successfully applied to simulate urban water demand, such as artificial neural network [12], support vector regression [19], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system [20] and random forests [21]. 3) Several studies indicated that hybrid techniques yield superior outcomes, when compared with the classical single models, such as Chen, et al. [21] and Altunkaynak and Nigussie [22]. 4) A number of methods, techniques and models have been used to forecast water demand basing on weather or climatic factors.A review of different municipal water demand modelling techniques over the past few decades, [5,[13][14][15][16], highlighted various issues that include: 1) Most of these methods and techniques were focused on the prediction of short-term water demand, and little research has considered medium-to long-term urban water demand. 2) Different artificial intelligence techniques were successfully applied to simulate urban water demand, such as artificial neural network [12], support vector regression [19], adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system [20] and random forests [21]. 3) Several studies indicated that hybrid techniques yield superior outcomes, when compared with the classical single models, such as Chen, et al.

The main advantages of optimisation algorithms are their ability to select the optimal values of parameters of the system under different conditions and they have time-saving qualities.

        <p>The suggested methodology was applied to the observed water consumption and climatic factor data relating to the South East Water (SEW) utility, which is one of three retail water utilities that purchase water wholesale from Melbourne Water company in Melbourne City, Australia.

The urban water system network of SEW utility serves more than 1.7 million individuals in a 3640 km 2 area, and the company has approximately 727,00 customers, categorised into residential, industrial and commercial [45].The suggested methodology was applied to the observed water consumption and climatic factor data relating to the South East Water (SEW) utility, which is one of three retail water utilities that purchase water wholesale from Melbourne Water company in Melbourne City, Australia.

        <p>The collected data comprise monthly urban water consumption (megalitre, ML), maximum temperature (Tmax) (•c), minimum temperature (Tmin) (•c), mean temperature (Tmean) (•c), solar radiation (Srad) (MJ/m 2 ), potential evapotranspiration (FA-O56) (mm), vapour pressure (VP) (hpa), rainfall (Rain) (mm), evaporation (Eva) (mm) maximum relative humidity (RHmax) (%), and minimum relative humidity (RHmax) (%) from 2000 to 2015. Figure 1 shows the time series and box-plot of monthly water consumption for SEW utility. The figure reveals the decrease in water consumption due to drought, and water-conserving policies and initiatives. After that, the consumption increased, possibly because restrictions were eased after the impact of the drought lessened. Also, it may be due to the strategies that Melbourne Corporation pursued by upgrading the dams and relying on other resources, such as water desalination and water recycling [44].The collected data comprise monthly urban water consumption (megalitre, ML), maximum temperature (Tmax) (•c), minimum temperature (Tmin) (•c), mean temperature (Tmean) (•c), solar radiation (Srad) (MJ/m 2 ), potential evapotranspiration (FA-O56) (mm), vapour pressure (VP) (hpa), rainfall (Rain) (mm), evaporation (Eva) (mm) maximum relative humidity (RHmax) (%), and minimum relative humidity (RHmax) (%) from 2000 to 2015.

        <p>Recent developments in urban water predictive methodologies have highlighted the need to apply different data pre-processing techniques, which could be classified into normalisation, cleaning and select best model input [5,46]. To be in accordance with Tabachnick and Fidell [47], the natural logarithm was used to normalise all raw time series of water and climatic factors to reduce both the impact of the outliers and the multicollinearity between independent factors. Zubaidi, et al. [8] mention that the relation between water demand time series and climatic time series is stochastic. Also, stochastic models will offer a better reflection of reality and insight into the system's dynamics [48]. Hence, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach was applied to decompose the original time series of dependent and independent variables into a trend, seasonal, stochastic and noise components, and detect the stochastic component after that. EMD is used in the analysis of various problems, such as machinery fault diagnosis [49] and biomedical signal analysis [50].Recent developments in urban water predictive methodologies have highlighted the need to apply different data pre-processing techniques, which could be classified into normalisation, cleaning and select best model input [5,46].

Additionally, Rahim, et al. [5] reported that different multi-layer feedforward neural networks (MLFFNNs) have been successfully developed utilising propagation networks in a water demand estimation model for short and medium terms. The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm was employed for training the ANN model because it can effectively simulate any independent/dependent map [55]. The structure of the ANN model can be categorised into four layers: the input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer contains the independent variable (climatic factors), the output layer involves the dependent variable (water demand), and the hidden layers comprise the hidden neurons, which are responsible for stimulating the nonlinear relationship between water consumption and climatic factors. As in Zubaidi, et al. [18], the tansigmoidal activation function was considered in both the hidden layers and the linear activation function was utilised in the output layer. In this research, total data can be randomly categorised into training (70%), testing (15%) and validation datasets (15%) [56]. Following González Perea, et al. [57], the ANN model was integrated with a metaheuristic algorithm to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the ANN model that includes the learning rate coefficient (LR) and the number of neurons hidden in the first (N1) and second (N2) hidden layers.In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using the ANN model to predict urban water demand because it is capable of accurately simulating the nonlinear time series.

        <p>In the ANN technique, before achieving the stages of training, testing, and validation, it is important to locate two hyperparameters, which are the learning rate coefficient (LR) and the number of neurons hidden (N1 and N2) for the hidden layer one and two, respectively. These hyperparameters are responsible for mapping the nonlinear relationship among the stochastic signals of water consumption and climatic factors. While the determination of these hyperparameters, based on a trial and error procedure, may not present the optimum solutions. For this purpose, the ANN model is hybridised with the slime mould algorithm (SMA-ANN) (automated machine learning) to select the best LR, N1 and N2 for the ANN model. Additionally, two extra metaheuristics were hybridised with the ANN, the multi-verse optimiser (MVO-ANN) and the backtracking search algorithm (BSA-ANN), to assess and validate the results of the SMA-ANN algorithm. Five population sizes (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 popsize) with 200 iterations were employed for each hybrid algorithm to select the popsize that could offer the lower value of fitness function (root mean square error, RMSE).In the ANN technique, before achieving the stages of training, testing, and validation, it is important to locate two hyperparameters, which are the learning rate coefficient (LR) and the number of neurons hidden (N1 and N2) for the hidden layer one and two, respectively.

        <p>First of all, data on water consumption and 10 climatic factors were normalised and cleaned according to section 3.1, Figure 3 shows the normalised and cleaned water data. Figure 3 (A) shows that the variance of the seasonal periods along the time series has been reduced in comparison with Figure 1 (A). Also, Figure 3 (B) shows that the time series, after the normalisation and treating the outliers, tends to follow a normal distribution in comparison with Figure 1 (B). Then, the EMD approach was applied to analyse the normalised data of water consumption and all climatic factors to unravel the stochastic components of each time series. Figure 4 presents the normalised and cleaned data for water consumption and its decomposed components including trend, seasonal, stochastic and noise. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests are used to assess the stationarity of the stochastic component for each factor (i.e., these two tests are used to test and select the stochastic signal). It can be also seen that other components (trend and seasonal) represent the deterministic signal, which is driven by socio-economic factors. Table 1 presents the correlation coefficients between water consumption and climatic factors time series in the raw and stochastic stage. The table shows that data pre-processing techniques produce significant improvements in the quality of the data, such as increasing the correlation coefficient between water consumption and maximum temperature time series (from 0.63 to 0.93). Additionally, the correlation coefficient between the stochastic signal of water consumption and climatic factors over sixteen years confirmed the relation between water consumption and climatic factor. In the final stage of data pre-processing, a tolerance method was used to locate the best scenario of independent factors, climatic factors, that can accurately simulate the stochastic component of water demand and omit redundant factors to avoid multi-collinearity. The tolerance values for all the climatic factors in the initial stage are less than the minimum limit of acceptance (i.e. it should be more than 0.1) except the Rain, which has tolerance value equal to 0.43. So, the climatic factors that have multicollinearity were removed separately, one by one, until the tolerance values of the selected model were reached more than 0.1, as shown in Table 2. The latter shows that Tmax, RHmin and Rain were selected to be the best scenario of independent factors based on the tolerance value. As presented in Table 2, the tolerance value for each climatic factor was more than 0.1, which means the multicollinearity assumption was not violated. datapoints) and validation (15%, 29 datapoints) to build and assess the prediction model.

        <p>The ANN model needs to be integrated with the metaheuristic algorithm to determine the optimum hyperparameters of the ANN model, including LR, N1 and N2. Thus, the SMA algorithm For a closer inspection of the 50 popsize of all the three hybrid algorithms. Figure 7 shows that SMA-ANN algorithm yielded the lowest RMSE (0.0116) after 165 iterations, while the RMSE was 0.01241 (after 33 iterations) and 0.01261 (after 60 iterations) for MVO-ANN and BSA-ANN algorithm, respectively. That means that the MVO-ANN and BSA-ANN algorithms did not improve their performance, based on the value of fitness function (RMSE), along with the iteration limit. For these reasons, SMA-ANN is a better choice to determine the hyperparameters of the ANN approach comparing with MVO-ANN and BSA-ANN algorithms. So, the 50 popsize of SMA-ANN algorithm offers LR, N1 and N2 values of 0.7094, 2, and 6, respectively. Three statistical metrics were applied to examine the ability of the model to generalise data, in the validation stage, and compare the results of the SMA-ANN with the ANN model. Table 3 provides three metrics, MAE, MSE (absolute error) and MARE (relative error), to assess the non-linear dependency between the actual and simulated water demand for both models. According to Dawson, et al. [58], both models showed good accuracy, but the SMA-ANN can predict water demand rather well based on the MARE value. 8 presents the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) for SMA-ANN and the ANN models. The values of R 2 delivers information for the linear relationship between the actual water consumption (Target, ML) and predicted water demand (Output, ML) for both models. Similar to the error tests (absolute and relative), both models offered good results according to Dawson, et al.

        <p>However, the value of R 2 for the SMA-ANN model was 0.9, which is more accurate than that of the ANN model (0.87). Additionally, the scatter data for the SMA-ANN model were falling closer to the ideal line than the scatter data for the ANN model. Figure 9 shows the Bland-Altman for the SMA-ANN and ANN models. The SMA-ANN has a mean = -0.002998 ML with limits of the agreement being -0.03358, 0.02759 ML, while these values for the ANN model were -0.003439, -0.03536 and 0.02947 ML for the mean, lower and upper limits of agreement area, respectively. Additionally, a good agreement was noticed for the SMA-ANN model because up to 97% of the data are scattered between the limits of agreement, whereas the proportion was 90% for the ANN model. Generally, the obtained results revealed that the SMA-ANN model has limits of agreement much closer to the mean, and it has a higher agreement percentage compared with the ANN model. Additionally, there was no trend in the scattered data for both Figures 8 and9, and the randomness of the residual data was assessed and confirmed using the ADF test. That means the tolerance method was successfully used to select the best model input. The obtained results emphasised that the determination of the ANNs' parameters using hybridisation with SMA algorithm is better than that conducted by trial and error procedure.

        <p>All the statistical tests examined and validated the SMA-ANN model and, for more examination, ADF and KPSST tests were used to check the stationarity of the simulated stochastic signal of water demand and residual analysis. The results show that the simulated time series of water demand is stationary and the residual data are normally distributed, which was assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Furthermore, a graphical test was used to confirm the SMA-ANN model by comparing the observed and simulated water time series in the validation stage as shown in Figure 10, which shows that the model can closely follow the trend and cycles of the observed stochastic time series based on the scale of error. There were several slight deviations in the simulated time series that may come from the influence of fluctuation of the climatic factors. However, based on both scale of error and the result of Bland-Altman for the SMA-ANN, the error can be considered statistically insignificant.

        <p>In this study, the potential of novel coupled data pre-processing and automated machine learning for monthly stochastic urban water demand prediction based on several climatic factors was investigated. Data for water consumption and 10 climatic factors for South East Water Company in Melbourne City were utilised for building and assessing the proposed methodology. Data preprocessing techniques were considered to analyse and select the stochastic signals of water consumption and climatic factors time series by EMD approach, and to detect the best independent variables by the tolerance method. The automated machine learning includes the ANN model, which integrated with the SMA algorithm to find optimal hyperparameters of the ANN model. The results highlighted the importance of data pre-processing to prepare the stochastic pattern of dependent and independent variables and select the best scenario of independent variables. Additionally, the SMA-ANN was found to be superior to both BSA-ANN and MVO-ANN algorithms based on RMSE as an objective function. Moreover, the performance of the hybrid model, SMA-ANN, was more accurate than the ANN (stand-alone) approach depending on different statistical tests. Furthermore, the outcomes indicated that the suggested methodology can be successfully applied in regions that suffer from climate change (i.e. drought), such as Melbourne City. Consequently, South East Water Company can take advantage of this study's findings to establish effective strategies for optimised system operation and to maintain a balance between water requested and delivered. It also helps to establish appropriate pricing plans, schedule new changes in the network and optimise the operating procedures, such as pumps, to enhance the water quality, and to reduce the uncertainty. Based on recent literature, severe weather will probably become more common in the future. Thus, there is an urgent need for more studies that use the same or different data analytic and artificial intelligence techniques to simulate the stochastic component of urban water demand based on climate factors for regions that suffer from climate change. However, the availability of reliable data for water consumption and climatic factors for the medium or long term is considered a principal limitation of this methodology.In this study, the potential of novel coupled data pre-processing and automated machine learning for monthly stochastic urban water demand prediction based on several climatic factors was investigated.
