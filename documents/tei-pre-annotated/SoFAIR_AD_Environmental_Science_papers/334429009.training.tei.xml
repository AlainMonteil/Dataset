        <p>Hard carbons have shown considerable promise as anodes for emerging sodium-ion battery technologies. Current understanding of sodium-storage behaviour in hard carbons attributes capacity to filling of graphitic interlayers and pores, and adsorption at defects, although there is still considerable debate regarding the voltages at which these mechanisms occur. Here, ex situ 23 Na solid-state NMR and total scattering studies on a systematically tuned series of hard carbons revealed the formation of increasingly metallic sodium clusters in direct correlation to the growing pore size, occurring only in samples which exhibited a low voltage plateau. Combining experimental results with DFT calculations, we propose a revised mechanistic model in which sodium ions store first simultaneously and continuously at defects, within interlayers and on pore surfaces. Once these higher energy binding sites are filled, pore filling occurs during the plateau region, where the densely confined sodium takes on a greater degree of metallicity.Hard carbons have shown considerable promise as anodes for emerging sodium-ion battery technologies.

        <p>As the global energy demand increases, the development of effective and sustainable energy storage systems is becoming critically important. Whilst lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an established technology, 1 the uneven global distribution and limited supply of lithium reserves greatly restricts their use for large-scale energy storage applications. Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are considered a natural successor to LIBs because of their similar chemical and electrochemical properties, 2 offering a more sustainable and lower cost alternative. However, one significant limitation in the progress of NIB technology has been the development of suitable anode materials. 3 Graphite anodes are widely used in LIBs, forming the stage one graphite intercalation compound (GIC) LiC6 with a reversible capacity of 372 mAh g -1 . 4 On the other hand, in conventional electrolytes sodium ions cannot intercalate into graphite to any great extent (NaC64), 5 and therefore graphite is unsuitable for NIB applications.As the global energy demand increases, the development of effective and sustainable energy storage systems is becoming critically important.

        <p>Instead, since the first report by Stevens and Dahn in 2000, 6 much research has been conducted into non-graphitic hard carbons as NIB anodes, and these materials have exhibited promising reversible capacities around 300 mAh g -1 . 3,4,7,8 Hard carbons are composed of randomly-oriented, curved and defective graphene nanosheets, turbostratically stacked with large interlayer distances, 9,10 providing sodium storage capacity at defects and sheet edges, within pores, and between expanded graphene layers. For hard carbons, the characteristic charge-discharge profiles typically exhibit a sloping region between 1.0 and 0.1 V, and a plateau below 0.1 V. In previous studies, these two regions have generally been attributed to distinct sodium storage mechanisms. The early model proposed by Stevens and Dahn based on small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS) analysis assigned sodium intercalation to the sloping voltage region, and micropore filling to the low voltage plateau. 11,12 This model was later supported by operando nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray scattering analysis. 13,14,15 In contrast, an alternative model was proposed consisting of surface and defect adsorption in the sloping region followed by interlayer intercalation in the low voltage plateau, with sodium plating occurring close to 0 V; 16 subsequent reports have suggested different combinations of these various Na storage processes. 17,18,19,20,21,22 However, several of these studies dismiss pore filling based on the low pore volumes observed using gas adsorption techniques. 21,22 The development of operando and in situ measurements in techniques such as SAXS, WAXS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) 11,12,19 and NMR spectroscopy 13 has enabled these studies, although there is still considerable debate regarding the sodium storage mechanisms at different voltages. These investigations have studied a range of different carbons and, therefore, the conflicting explanations are hardly surprising, given the dependence of structural morphology, porosity and surface area on the precursor material and synthesis method. Generally, carbons were obtained from simple sugars, natural biomass or polymer precursors, and converted either by direct pyrolysis, microwave irradiation, hydrothermal carbonisation or a combination of these processes. 23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 Hydrothermal carbons, in particular, are wellsuited for energy storage applications since the spherical morphology obtained after treatment enables uniform charge distribution across particle surfaces and a better packing density in the electrode, whilst the low surface area-to-volume ratio can minimise the extent of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed in the first cycle. 23,33 In this work, a series of hard carbons was prepared by hydrothermal treatment of glucose followed by high temperature pyrolysis; by altering the temperature, the porosity, number of defects, and graphitic structure could be systematically tuned. A correlation between the microstructure and sodium storage behaviour was established with ex situ 23 Na NMR spectroscopy, X-ray and neutron scattering, and supported with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, the NMR measurements demonstrated the increasingly metallic nature of the stored sodium with increasing pore size. This quasimetallic environment was only present in the carbons that exhibited a low voltage plateau, supporting the mechanistic assignment of pore filling during this region. However, while higher pyrolysis temperatures increase pore capacity, diffusion pathways within graphite interlayers and across defects are reduced, rendering some pores inaccessible and limiting sodium storage in the sloping region; optimising the performance of hard carbons is therefore a balance between maintaining an expanded interlayer distance, the number of defects, and open diffusion pathways, whilst also maximising the size of accessible pores.Instead, since the first report by Stevens and Dahn in 2000, 6 much research has been conducted into non-graphitic hard carbons as NIB anodes, and these materials have exhibited promising reversible capacities around 300 mAh g -1 . 3,4,7,8 Hard carbons are composed of randomly-oriented, curved and defective graphene nanosheets, turbostratically stacked with large interlayer distances, 9,10 providing sodium storage capacity at defects and sheet edges, within pores, and between expanded graphene layers.

        <p>A series of hard carbons was prepared by hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) 34 of glucose (denoted GHTC), followed by pyrolysis at different temperatures (1000 °C, 1300 °C, 1500 °C, 1700 °C, 1900 °C) to remove heteroatom defects, introduce conductivity, and tune porosity, yielding the five samples G1000, G1300, G1500, G1700 and G1900. The resulting carbons retained their spherical morphology after high temperature carbonisation (Figure 1a andb) whilst the pyrolysis temperature had little effect on particle size with all samples showing agglomerated carbon spheres in the range 200 nm-5 μm (Figure S1). The variation in electrochemical behaviour can therefore be fully attributed to the materials' structural and compositional differences. Subsequent high temperature heat treatment successfully removed polar surface groups and heteroatom defects, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 1c-f, S2). In the high resolution O1s spectrum of GHTC, peaks at 533.2 eV and 532.0 eV can be assigned to C-O and C=O bonds respectively (Figure 1d), corresponding to deconvoluted peaks at 287.3 eV and 289.2 eV in the C1s core-level spectrum (Figure 1c). 35 After pyrolysis, these C-O and C=O peaks are significantly weaker indicating a substantial reduction in oxygen functionalities (Figure 1e andf). Analysis of the higher resolution data indicates a composition of 18.1 at% O and 81.9 at% C after HTC; this ratio is significantly decreased after high temperature carbonisation, with a decreasing amount of O with increasing temperature (5.9-1.3 at%, Table 1).A series of hard carbons was prepared by hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) 34 of glucose (denoted GHTC), followed by pyrolysis at different temperatures (1000 °C, 1300 °C, 1500 °C, 1700 °C, 1900 °C) to remove heteroatom defects, introduce conductivity, and tune porosity, yielding the five samples G1000, G1300, G1500, G1700 and G1900.

        <p>The microstructure of these materials was tuned by varying the pyrolysis temperature between 1000 and 1900 °C. TEM images reveal structures typical of hard carbons composed of mostly disordered domains with some regions of graphitic stacking (Figure 2a-e). At 1000 °C, amorphous domains dominate, whereas in the samples treated at 1700 and 1900 °C, larger areas of graphitic stacking become apparent, since greater order is introduced with increasing carbonisation temperature. These results are consistent with the rearrangement of disordered crosslinked carbon regions into a coherent sp 2 network, alongside the loss of oxygen functionalities.The microstructure of these materials was tuned by varying the pyrolysis temperature between 1000 and 1900 °C.

        <p>Further evidence for the evolution of structural ordering with temperature was obtained by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2f). Hard carbons generally exhibit broad signals around 1350 and 1580 cm -1 (Dand G-band, respectively), related to in-plane sp 2 C-bond breathing and stretching modes, and often no 2D signal at ~2700 cm -1 , which provides information regarding graphitic layer stacking and coherence. 36,37 The Raman spectrum of G1000 is characteristic of hard carbon, with very broad D and G bands and an extremely weak 2D signal; with increasing pyrolysis temperature, the peaks narrow and sharpen, and the intensity ratio ID/IG increases (Figure 2f). This ID/IG trend is consistent with the loss of residual oxygen functionalities and increasing in-plane ordering (La = 0.8 nm in G1000 to La = 1.2 nm in G1900, Table 1), 38 and the sharpening of signals implies conversion of rings with order other than six into aromatic rings. 37 Furthermore, a 2D signal appears in the samples pyrolysed at 1700 °C and above, implying that some graphitic layer coherence is developing, consistent with the observations made by TEM.Further evidence for the evolution of structural ordering with temperature was obtained by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2f).

        <p>The development of structural ordering is also observed in the neutron total scattering (Figure 3a) and SAXS/WAXS (Figure S3) patterns, where both the interlayer distance (d002) and the in-plane distance (d100) approach the values for graphite with increasing temperature (Figure 5b andS4). Furthermore, an increase in the stack thickness and in-plane crystallite size (Figure 3e andf) was calculated, with stacks of 2-3 graphene layers with 1.5-2 nm wide basal planes for the lower temperature G1000-G1500 samples, and stacks of up to 10-15 graphene layers with 4 nm wide basal planes for the G1900 sample.The development of structural ordering is also observed in the neutron total scattering (Figure 3a) and SAXS/WAXS (Figure S3) patterns, where both the interlayer distance (d002) and the in-plane distance (d100) approach the values for graphite with increasing temperature (Figure 5b andS4).

        <p>These results are consistent with the qualitative observations made by TEM and the trend in La (Table 1) calculated from Raman data, although the results from Raman may be considered an underestimate due to the dominant effects of small crystallites. 37 In the pair distribution functions (PDF) (Figure 3b) and difference PDFs (Figure 3c), the signal at ~1.4 Å (d1, Figure S4a) indicates that the carbon material after HTC contains mostly sp 2 -hybridised carbon, but with a substantial amount of sp 3 -hybridised carbon, observed by the shoulder on the peak, around 1.5 Å. These sp 3 carbons disappear after heating to 1000 °C, indicated by the negative peak in the difference PDF at ~1.6 Å (Figure 3c), consistent with XPS results (Figure 1c ande). The appearance of the signal at 2.8 Å (d3, Figure S4a), characteristic of the C1-C4 distance in a benzene ring, confirms the growth of aromatic domains within the material. The largest change in PDF is observed between GHTC and G1000, indicating that the initial graphitisation takes place at low temperature as expected (Figure 3c). The next significant structural change occurs from G1500 to G1700 where the development of longer-range order is evident from the increased signal at higher distances (Figure 3c). This observation also corresponds to the trends in graphitic ordering and domain size obtained from analysis of the 002 and 100 peaks (Figure 3e, f and S4), where the largest structural difference occurs between these two pyrolysis temperatures; similarly, in the Raman spectra, the 2D band only appears above 1700 °C. These results suggest that below 1500 °C, nucleation of graphitic regions is the predominant reaction occurring within the material, without large changes to the domain size. Above 1500 °C, growth of the graphitic domains and ordering of the stacked planes are the dominant processes, although in some regions rearrangement is constrained, reflected in the double peak model required to fit the 002 peak in the high temperature data (Figure S3).These results are consistent with the qualitative observations made by TEM and the trend in La (Table 1) calculated from Raman data, although the results from Raman may be considered an underestimate due to the dominant effects of small crystallites. 37 In the pair distribution functions (PDF) (Figure 3b) and difference PDFs (Figure 3c), the signal at ~1.4 Å (d1, Figure S4a) indicates that the carbon material after HTC contains mostly sp 2 -hybridised carbon, but with a substantial amount of sp 3 -hybridised carbon, observed by the shoulder on the peak, around 1.5 Å.

        <p>The pore diameters were also calculated from the Guinier-Porod region 11,39 in the small angle neutron scattering (SANS) (Figure 3a) and SAXS (Figure S3 and S4) data and were found to be very similar in size to the corresponding basal planes; dimensions of 1-2 nm for G1000-G1500 and up to a maximum size of 5 nm for G1900 (Figure 5b) were observed, suggesting that the pore size is dependent on the lateral size of the graphene basal plane. The lack of any structure factor peaks suggests that the pores are relatively dilute, as there would otherwise be pore-pore correlation peaks in the SAXS/SANS region.The pore diameters were also calculated from the Guinier-Porod region 11,39 in the small angle neutron scattering (SANS) (Figure 3a) and SAXS (Figure S3 and S4) data and were found to be very similar in size to the corresponding basal planes; dimensions of 1-2 nm for G1000-G1500 and up to a maximum size of 5 nm for G1900 (Figure 5b) were observed, suggesting that the pore size is dependent on the lateral size of the graphene basal plane.

        <p>The relative pore volumes, obtained using the Guinier-Porod model 11 (equations S1-3), for the G1000-G1500 materials remain similar, suggesting only limited pore creation within this temperature range (Figure 3d). Above 1500 °C, a significant change in pore volume was observed, increasing by a factor of three between G1500 and G1900. In contrast, the total pore volume determined from N2 adsorption significantly decreased, with a 90% loss between G1000 and G1300 (Figure 3d and S5, Table S1).The relative pore volumes, obtained using the Guinier-Porod model 11 (equations S1-3), for the G1000-G1500 materials remain similar, suggesting only limited pore creation within this temperature range (Figure 3d).

        <p>Correspondingly, the glucose-derived carbon pyrolysed at 1000 °C has the highest specific surface area of 382 m 2 g -1 ; at temperatures above 1000 °C, the surface area decreases dramatically to ~10 m 2 g -1 (Table 1). The pore volume and surface area values calculated from the CO2 adsorption isotherms are generally higher than those from N2 measurements, since CO2 can probe smaller pores, and decrease more gradually with elevated temperatures (Figure 3d and S5, Table 1), whilst the pore size distributions from both measurements indicate that the materials are mostly micro-and mesoporous (Figure S5). The discrepancy with the trends observed from SAXS/SANS analysis suggests that although porosity is developing as the carbons are heated, above 1000 °C the larger pores and subsequently the micropores close off during pyrolysis, becoming inaccessible to gas molecules, but remain observable by X-ray and neutron scattering. Overall, the characterisation indicates that although the particle morphology is maintained after carbonisation, the structures of the glucose-derived carbons are highly tuneable by altering the pyrolysis temperature, with greater ordering arising from fewer defects, increasing aromaticity, decreasing interlayer spacing, and larger crystallite size. Pore size and surface area are also highly dependent on the temperature of carbonisation with the development of larger, closed pores above 1500 °C.Correspondingly, the glucose-derived carbon pyrolysed at 1000 °C has the highest specific surface area of 382 m 2 g -1 ; at temperatures above 1000 °C, the surface area decreases dramatically to ~10 m 2 g -1 (Table 1).

        <p>In order to investigate the structural influences on the performance and storage mechanism in NIBs, electrochemical testing of the materials was carried out in half cells using sodium metal as the counter electrode, in the voltage window 0-2.5 V. During galvanostatic cycling at 30 mA g -1 , the carbons exhibit a range of reversible capacities (96-293 mAh g -1 ) and first cycle Coulombic efficiencies (FCCE) (39-96 %) (Figure 5a and Table S1), with the highest performing G1500 comparing reasonably with other previously reported carbonaceous materials. 2 The discharge curves of the samples show varying profiles, from which insight into the sodium storage mechanism may be gained; G1300 and G1500 derive their capacity from both the slope and plateau regions (Figure 5b and Table S1), whereas G1700 and G1900 both show mainly plateau capacity. Conversely, the capacity of G1000 is exclusively in the sloping region, and is highly irreversible in the first cycle, consistent with having the highest surface area available for SEI formation, and many defect sites and oxygen functionalities where sodium may remain trapped. A corresponding reduction peak is observed in the cyclic voltammogram between 0.7 and 0 V in the first cycle (Figure S6), and similar smaller irreversible peaks appear in the other samples, reflecting the irreversible capacity processes occurring in the first cycle.In order to investigate the structural influences on the performance and storage mechanism in NIBs, electrochemical testing of the materials was carried out in half cells using sodium metal as the counter electrode, in the voltage window 0-2.5 V.

        <p>Analysis of the ex situ 23 Na magic-angle spinning (MAS) ssNMR spectra of the fully sodiated materials provides insight into how the sodium storage environments vary according to the carbon structure (Figure 4a). A sharp peak is observed at around 0 ppm for all of the carbons, which is attributed to diamagnetic sodium in the residual electrolyte salt and SEI layer. 13 In the spectrum of G1300, a broad peak is observed centred at about 750 ppm (Figure 4b). This shift falls well outside the range of diamagnetic sodium compounds, indicating that this species is exhibiting a Knight shift caused by the presence of conduction electrons (metallic sodium exhibits a peak at 1135 ppm). 40 In the lowest temperature-treated material, this quasi-metallic peak is non-existent, implying that sodium stored in the sloping region is mainly ionic in nature, consistent with sodium adsorbed at defects, interlayers or pore surfaces. 13 With higher heat treatment, the quasi-metallic peak grows in intensity and shifts to higher frequency, closer to that of sodium metal (Figure 4b). In G1900, the presence of metallic sodium is clear from the strong peak observed at 1135 ppm. Interestingly, in these samples which were discharged to 5 mV, metallic sodium was observed before reaching 0 V, contrary to previous reports. 15,16,19,21 The growing metallic character of the sodium corresponds to the increasing pore size with temperature and is consistent with the growth of sodium clusters within the pores (Figure 4b). Here, beyond the first adsorbed monolayer, sodium ions must necessarily be reduced to minimise charge repulsion which would otherwise prevent confinement of many sodium ions within one space. Therefore, the larger the pore and subsequently the cluster, the greater the metallic character of the sodium environment, corresponding to the progressive shift of the sodium peak to higher frequencies with increased temperatures.Analysis of the ex situ 23 Na magic-angle spinning (MAS) ssNMR spectra of the fully sodiated materials provides insight into how the sodium storage environments vary according to the carbon structure (Figure 4a). A sharp peak is observed at around 0 ppm for all of the carbons, which is attributed to diamagnetic sodium in the residual electrolyte salt and SEI layer. 13 In the spectrum of G1300, a broad peak is observed centred at about 750 ppm (Figure 4b). This shift falls well outside the range of diamagnetic sodium compounds, indicating that this species is exhibiting a Knight shift caused by the presence of conduction electrons (metallic sodium exhibits a peak at 1135 ppm). 40 In the lowest temperature-treated material, this quasi-metallic peak is non-existent, implying that sodium stored in the sloping region is mainly ionic in nature, consistent with sodium adsorbed at defects, interlayers or pore surfaces. 13 With higher heat treatment, the quasi-metallic peak grows in intensity and shifts to higher frequency, closer to that of sodium metal (Figure 4b).

        <p>Combining the materials analysis and electrochemical characterisation allows us to correlate the hard carbon structure with the different sodium storage processes occurring during cell discharge. With increasing carbonisation temperature, the pore size increases, whilst the O/C ratio, degree of defects and graphitic interlayer spacing all decrease (Figure 5b); concurrently, in their voltage profiles, the capacity contribution from the sloping region generally decreases, whilst the plateau region increases, before dropping off at higher temperatures. In our revised mechanistic model, we propose that during the initial stages of sodiation, between 2.5 and 0.1 V, sodium storage occurs simultaneously at defects, within interlayer galleries and at pore surfaces. Once these sites are filled, residual pore filling takes place, below 0.1 V, until full sodiation is achieved.Combining the materials analysis and electrochemical characterisation allows us to correlate the hard carbon structure with the different sodium storage processes occurring during cell discharge.

        <p>In the sloping region, the changing voltage profile is a result of a combination of energetically different processes, as well as the continuous structural distortion arising from the interlayer expansion which accompanies the insertion of sodium ions. 41,42 While sodium diffusion within curved pores is rapid compared to inside graphitic interlayer galleries 43 and across heteroatom defects, 44 the ions are less strongly bound at these pore surfaces. 43 Therefore, interlayer intercalation and filling of defect sites occur preferentially to pore filling. DFT calculations of sodium binding in bilayer and monolayer graphitic models (Figure S9) indicate that different defect types influence the energetics of sodium storage differently, both at the defect site and at sites adjoining the defect. These simulations show that oxygen defects in the graphitic bilayer and on the surface lead to stronger sodium adsorption energies, especially at low sodium loading. Furthermore, the effect of oxygen-containing defects is not localised and can also improve the sodium storage at sites away from the defects, although at higher sodium concentrations, or higher specific capacities, the effect is reduced. Similarly, sodium intercalation in the graphitic bilayer model is mainly affected by the presence of the 2OC bilayer defect (Figure S8) at xNa&lt;3. At higher Na concentrations, the added Na start to fill the non-defective sites, so the calculated binding energies approach those of the non-defective graphitic bilayer (Figure S9). Comparing all the simulated systems (Figure S9), at low xNa (corresponding to low specific capacity), sodium storage at surface defects dominates, whereas as soon as the defect sites become saturated, sodium intercalation in expanded graphitic bilayers becomes energetically favourable too. Some studies have previously attributed the sloping region capacity to defect adsorption only; 16,18,21 with this series of materials, considering the scenario in which each sodium binds to one oxygen-containing defect, the maximum theoretical capacity derived from defect adsorption (Table S2) can only account for 48-79% of the total sloping capacity. Therefore, in combination with these and previous simulated results, 42,43,44 both sodium adsorption and intercalation in defective and turbostratic carbon regions contribute to the experimentally observed sloping voltage profiles. G1000, which has the highest concentration of oxygen-containing defects (5.9 at%) and the widest interlayer spacing (3.9 Å), exhibits the largest sloping capacity; the sloping capacity decreases with higher carbonisation temperatures, corresponding to the decrease in interlayer spacing and number of defects (Figure 5b). In addition, the onset voltage of the sloping region for the two high temperature materials is also lower (~0.5 V vs. ~1 V in G1000-G1500), indicative of the absence of defects as higher energy sodium binding sites (Figure 5a). Once all the available interlayer and defect sites are occupied, we hypothesise that residual filling of the pores takes place until the electrode is fully sodiated. Insertion of sodium into pores results in negligible structural distortion so the binding site energy remains almost constant; in addition, the sodium binding energy is weak, 43 and pore filling therefore corresponds to the low voltage plateau below 0.1 V. The NMR results support this mechanistic assertion, where the quasi-metallic environment was only observed in the carbons that exhibited plateau capacity (Figure 4). However, the plateau capacity does not monotonically increase with pore size but reaches a maximum at 1500 °C (Figure 5b). While the pore size continues to increase, the decrease in expanded graphitic stacks results in fewer diffusion pathways reaching the pores, and consequently some pores become inaccessible for sodium storage, corresponding to a smaller plateau capacity. The decrease in diffusion pathways also contributes to the diminishing performance at higher current densities, where G1700 and G1900 exhibit the poorest electrochemical performance across the range of current densities (Figure S7).In the sloping region, the changing voltage profile is a result of a combination of energetically different processes, as well as the continuous structural distortion arising from the interlayer expansion which accompanies the insertion of sodium ions. 41,42 While sodium diffusion within curved pores is rapid compared to inside graphitic interlayer galleries 43 and across heteroatom defects, 44 the ions are less strongly bound at these pore surfaces. 43 Therefore, interlayer intercalation and filling of defect sites occur preferentially to pore filling.

        <p>To summarise, G1000 has the highest concentration of defects and the widest interlayer spacing available for sodium storage, but pore filling is minimal due to the small diameter of the pores, resulting in a discharge profile entirely composed of sloping capacity (Figure 5c bottom panel). At intermediate pyrolysis temperatures, the number of oxygen defects decreases, and the interlayer spacing narrows slightly, but storage capacity from pores increases with the larger pore size; a decreasing slope capacity and a greater contribution from the plateau region are therefore observed in G1300 and G1500 (Figure 5c middle panel). In G1700 and G1900, the number of defects is very low, and there are even fewer expanded graphitic domains accessible for sodium intercalation as the interlayer spacing narrows; therefore, the capacity in the sloping region decreases significantly. Furthermore, whilst the pore size continues to increase, diffusion pathways are closed off, and consequently some pores become inaccessible for sodium storage, corresponding to a smaller plateau capacity (Figure 5c top panel).To summarise, G1000 has the highest concentration of defects and the widest interlayer spacing available for sodium storage, but pore filling is minimal due to the small diameter of the pores, resulting in a discharge profile entirely composed of sloping capacity (Figure 5c bottom panel).

        <p>Overall, the correlation between pore size, quasi-metallic sodium and plateau capacity provides strong evidence that pore filling occurs in the plateau region, and our revised model is in good agreement with the original proposed by Stevens and Dahn, 11 and several others. 13,15,18,19,29 However, we believe that each of these models alone insufficiently describes the processes occurring during the slope region, and that, based on the structural trends in these materials, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the slope capacity may be assigned to simultaneous and continuous processes of defect adsorption, interlayer intercalation, and adsorption on pore surfaces. Furthermore, the plateau capacity derived from pore filling is not independent of the structural characteristics associated with sloping capacity; as the graphitic interlayer spacings decrease, there are fewer diffusion pathways allowing sodium ions to reach the pores, rendering them inaccessible for sodium storage. The highest performance of the carbon pyrolysed at 1500 °C therefore results from the optimal combination of intermediate pore size with wide interlayer spacings which provide storage to sodium ions and diffusion channels into pores, as well as defects which serve as additional adsorption sites. a Calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method.Overall, the correlation between pore size, quasi-metallic sodium and plateau capacity provides strong evidence that pore filling occurs in the plateau region, and our revised model is in good agreement with the original proposed by Stevens and Dahn, 11 and several others. 13,15,18,19,29 However, we believe that each of these models alone insufficiently describes the processes occurring during the slope region, and that, based on the structural trends in these materials, it is reasonable to hypothesise that the slope capacity may be assigned to simultaneous and continuous processes of defect adsorption, interlayer intercalation, and adsorption on pore surfaces.

        <p>However, despite the higher porosity, the closing of diffusion pathways at high temperature results in an overall lower capacity, as these pores become inaccessible to sodium.

        <p>To form an atomic scale insight into sodium storage in hard carbon motifs, six different carbon models were prepared: pristine graphitic bilayer (simulating the intercalation of sodium in graphitic stacks), graphitic bilayer with an oxygen defect, pristine graphene surface (adsorption of sodium on the hard carbon basal plane), and three oxygen-containing graphene surfaces (adsorption of sodium on defect sites on the hard carbon basal plane).
