        <p>Grasslands, comprising open grassland, grassy shrublands and savannas, cover about 40% of the Earth's surface and 69% of Earth's agricultural land area [1][2][3] . Grasslands serve as an important global reservoir of biodiversity, including many iconic and endemic species, but also provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to humans. These benefits include a wide range of ecosystem services, such as food production, water supply and regulation, carbon storage and climate mitigation, pollination, and a host of cultural services [1][2][3] . Despite the importance of grassland, its degradation is widespread and accelerating in many parts of the world [4][5][6] , with as much as 49% of grassland area globally having been degraded to some extent 5,7,8 .Grasslands, comprising open grassland, grassy shrublands and savannas, cover about 40% of the Earth's surface and 69% of Earth's agricultural land area [1][2][3] .

        <p>Grassland degradation poses an enormous threat to the hundreds of millions of people who rely on grasslands for food, fuel, fibre and medicinal products, in addition to cultural values 9,10 . The global cost of grassland degradation on livestock production has been estimated at $6.8 billion over the period 2001-2011 11 , with the resulting impact on human welfare being particularly severe in regions where most the population is below the poverty line. Grassland degradation also creates major environmental problems, as grasslands play a critical role in biodiversity conservation, climate and water regulation, and global biogeochemical cycles 2,4 .Grassland degradation poses an enormous threat to the hundreds of millions of people who rely on grasslands for food, fuel, fibre and medicinal products, in addition to cultural values 9,10 .

        <p>For example, the conversion of tropical grassy biomes to arable cropland poses a threat to biodiversity, given grasslands have vertebrate species richness comparable to forests 12 . The expansion of croplands in United States has caused widespread conversion of prairie grasslands, with considerable cost to wildlife 6 . Moreover, the conversion of grasslands to arable cropland and disturbance through overgrazing, fire and invasive species can lead to substantial soil carbon loss 13 .For example, the conversion of tropical grassy biomes to arable cropland poses a threat to biodiversity, given grasslands have vertebrate species richness comparable to forests 12 .

        <p>Because of these problems, grassland degradation represents a major global challenge that must be addressed to achieve the key targets of biodiversity agendas, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, hunger and poverty alleviation, and climate change mitigation. Combating degradation is also central to the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), which puts a firm focus on the urgent need for restoration strategies for degraded ecosystems, including grasslands.Because of these problems, grassland degradation represents a major global challenge that must be addressed to achieve the key targets of biodiversity agendas, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, hunger and poverty alleviation, and climate change mitigation.

        <p>There are multiple, co-occurring drivers of grassland degradation, including overgrazing, eutrophication, land conversion to forestry and crops, land abandonment, invasive species, climate extremes and altered fire regimes (Fig. 1). These drivers are also often closely linked to socio-economic drivers, such as spatial expansion of humans, the economics of land use, changes in affluence and dietary preferences, and in land tenure and a lack of enforcement of land use rights 9 . Climate change is further exacerbating grassland degradation, especially through more frequent and intense fires and droughts 8 . Despite the importance of grasslands, there has been little progress in finding solutions to halting and reversing global grassland degradation, which is compromising sustainable development and the ecosystem services grasslands provide.There are multiple, co-occurring drivers of grassland degradation, including overgrazing, eutrophication, land conversion to forestry and crops, land abandonment, invasive species, climate extremes and altered fire regimes (Fig. 1).

        <p>In this Perspective, we consider the current state of and ecosystems service provided by grasslands (open grassland, grassy shrublands, and savanna). The known extent and dominant causes of grassland degradation are reviewed. We then consider the challenges that grassland restoration efforts face, from societal attitudes to practical efforts, and identify actions that are critical to the development of socio-ecological solutions to combat degradation and promote restoration of global grasslands. We argue that progress can only be made through increasing recognition of grasslands in regional and global policy, developing standardised indicators of degradation and restoration, introducing ecological innovation into restoration, and enhancing knowledge transfer and data sharing regarding restoration experiences.In this Perspective, we consider the current state of and ecosystems service provided by grasslands (open grassland, grassy shrublands, and savanna).

        <p>A key issue in the poor recognition of grassland in policy is a lack of clarity in defining the grassland biome. Indeed, there are many definitions of "grassland" and the boundaries between grasslands and other ecosystems are often poorly delineated, which contributes to variable estimates of their global extent 3 . For example, some definitions of grassland have a relatively high tree cover of 30% before they become classed as forest 14 and in many regions there is no clear delineation of grasslands, forests and their distinct transition zones, which in Eurasia are called forest-steppes 15 . This Perspective uses the common definition of grasslands as areas dominated by grasses or other graminoids, with a low abundance of trees or shrubs 3,16 .A key issue in the poor recognition of grassland in policy is a lack of clarity in defining the grassland biome.

        <p>The definition here includes both temperate and tropical grasslands and considers broad grassland types based on a gradient anthropogenic influence, ranging from 'natural grasslands' that are climatically determined with minimal human interference, to 'semi-natural grasslands' that have been shaped by centuries of human activity, and 'intensively managed grasslands' that have been substantially modified for agriculture 3 . As agriculture has become increasingly intensive over the last century, 'intensively managed grasslands' of low plant species diversity now dominate in some parts of the world, characterised by the use of inorganic fertilisers, high stocking densities of productive livestock breeds, and often frequent re-sowing with highyielding plant varieties. While intensively managed grasslands are valued by some stakeholder groups, here we consider them potentially degraded given that they are fundamentally different from natural and semi-natural grasslands in terms of their biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide 17 .The definition here includes both temperate and tropical grasslands and considers broad grassland types based on a gradient anthropogenic influence, ranging from 'natural grasslands' that are climatically determined with minimal human interference, to 'semi-natural grasslands' that have been shaped by centuries of human activity, and 'intensively managed grasslands' that have been substantially modified for agriculture 3 .

        <p>Natural grasslands are often considered the most important grassland type. They are found in both the tropical (namely as savannas, which are extensive in Africa and South America) and temperate (North American prairies, Eurasian steppes and South American pampas) regions of the world. Their extent is largely climatically determined, occurring where the climate and/or soils cannot support woody plant growth, such as above the tree-line or in drylands. However, climatic factors often interact with natural disturbances, such as by fire or wild herbivores, which constrain growth of woody plants and maintain the grasses and associated low-growing plants 18 . Indeed, changes in the balance of these interacting factors can trigger radical change. For example, the encroachment of native woody plants into natural grasslands is occurring in many parts of Africa (and elsewhere), which is linked to a decline in burned area and herbivore densities along with warmer and wetter climates 19 . In contrast, the Holocene transition from extensive grasslands into the Sahara Desert was likely due to the onset of drier conditions at the end of the African Humid Period 20 .Natural grasslands are often considered the most important grassland type.

        <p>Semi-natural grasslands, also referred to as secondary grasslands 16 , have been created by clearing natural vegetation such as forest and by modifying natural grasslands. They are typically 'early successional' systems and would not exist without some human influence 3 . This type of grassland is of particularly high concern for conservation in Europe, due to their importance as reservoirs for biodiversity 21 and their historical role in the landscape 22 . Indeed, semi-natural grasslands have been produced by centuries of human activity, generally by traditional, low-intensity agriculture involving livestock grazing, hay-cutting, and sometimes management with fire, and are often valued for their aesthetics and are related to a sense of identity, place and heritage 22 .Semi-natural grasslands, also referred to as secondary grasslands 16 , have been created by clearing natural vegetation such as forest and by modifying natural grasslands.

        <p>Natural grasslands are grazed by wild herbivores, but large areas are also used for domestic livestock. As such, meat, dairy and other livestock products, such as wool, comprise the most prominent ecosystem services provided by both natural and semi-natural grasslands. Indeed, the livelihoods and cultures of some traditional pastoralist communities revolve almost entirely around their livestock systems 24 , which in turn maintains the diversity of livestock breeds 25 .Natural grasslands are grazed by wild herbivores, but large areas are also used for domestic livestock.

        <p>Natural grasslands also support rich biodiversity, hosting numerous species not found in forests 12,26 and distinct assemblages of native large herbivores and their predators, many of which are threatened by extinction 27 . Many of these species are charismatic and globally recognized, such as bison, wolves, rhinos and lions, and hence provide cultural services, such as ecotourism 28 .Natural grasslands also support rich biodiversity, hosting numerous species not found in forests 12,26 and distinct assemblages of native large herbivores and their predators, many of which are threatened by extinction 27 .

        <p>It is less acknowledged, however, that both natural and semi-natural grasslands provide other ecosystem services, including holding flood waters, providing clean water, regulating soil erosion, and providing wild food and medicines 10 .

        <p>The role of grasslands in carbon storage is often overlooked, but could contain 30% of the world's soil carbon stock 30 , with natural and sparsely grazed grasslands potentially acting as a notable global carbon sink and providing an important climate cooling service 31 . However, there is a global trend of grasslands transitioning towards a net warming effect on climate due to increased greenhouse gas emission associated with higher livestock numbers and management intensification 31 . Natural and sparsely grazed grasslands contain "irrecoverable carbon" that is vulnerable to land use conversion; once lost, this carbon is not recoverable over timescales relevant to climate mitigation 32 . Nevertheless, there is high potential for increasing soil carbon sequestration in grasslands via improved grazing and by arresting grassland conversion and degradation 33 .The role of grasslands in carbon storage is often overlooked, but could contain 30% of the world's soil carbon stock 30 , with natural and sparsely grazed grasslands potentially acting as a notable global carbon sink and providing an important climate cooling service 31 .

        <p>Globally, estimates suggest that as much as 49% of the total grassland 5,7,8 and about half of the natural grassland area has been degraded to some extent 34 . However, specific estimates of the extent of grassland degradation vary greatly. For instance, about 90% of the UK's semi-natural species-rich grasslands have been degraded as result of intensive agriculture and land conversion since the 1940s 17 . Up to 90% of the vast grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau have been degraded due to human activities and climate change 35 . Over 60% of the former grassland area of southern Brazil has been lost to unsuitable management and land use change 36 .Globally, estimates suggest that as much as 49% of the total grassland 5,7,8 and about half of the natural grassland area has been degraded to some extent 34 .

        <p>A key issue when considering grassland degradation is clarifying what it constitutes, especially since definitions of both grassland and degradation vary. Degradation is broadly defined as a decline in land condition, or more specifically the human-caused processes that drive a persistent decline or loss in biodiversity, ecosystem functions or ecosystem services 34 . Such a broad definition of grassland degradation can help to inform policy and practice about the level of grassland degradation in a certain region. However, pinpointing what degradation constitutes in specific settings can be less clear because it has both ecological and socioeconomic dimensions 37 , and different stakeholder groups prioritise different combinations of ecosystems services 38,39 . As such, the definition of grassland degradation can depend upon the stakeholder and needs to be tailored accordingly.A key issue when considering grassland degradation is clarifying what it constitutes, especially since definitions of both grassland and degradation vary.

        <p>Grassland degradation is defined here from a socio-ecological perspective, where grassland is considered degraded if the supply of multiple ecosystem services falls short of that demanded by grassland stakeholders 40 . In some cases, grassland degradation is apparent to all grassland stakeholders, for instance when overgrazing leads to loss of vegetation, declines in soil organic matter and consequent soil erosion 41 , or when natural or semi-natural grassland is converted to another land use. However, in many cases, perceptions of degradation could differ: the increase in plant production but accompanying loss of plant species diversity resulting from fertiliser use might be considered an improvement by pastoralists (due to increased forage production), but degradation by conservationists concerned with biodiversity protection 42 . Hence, defining grassland degradation from a socio-ecological perspective recognises that it alters the supply of multiple ecosystem services from grassland relative to their human demand by different stakeholders 40 . Moreover, a socio-ecological approach provides a framework for guiding the restoration of degraded grasslands as it considers the need to enhance the co-supply of multiple ecosystem services in efforts to meet the needs of all stakeholders 37,40,43 .Grassland degradation is defined here from a socio-ecological perspective, where grassland is considered degraded if the supply of multiple ecosystem services falls short of that demanded by grassland stakeholders 40 .

        <p>Although threats to natural and semi-natural grasslands are present globally (Fig. 1), the tropics face particularly acute threats 18 , while degradation of European semi-natural grassland has largely slowed 44 . Human activities are the principal drivers of grassland degradation. For example, increased disturbance from over-grazing or a heightened fire frequency has reduced vegetation cover, increasing susceptibility to soil erosion and desertification 45 . Conversely, the cessation of livestock grazing associated with extensive land abandonment of semi-natural grasslands in Europe during the 20 th century has led to grassland degradation due to the expansion of scrub 46. Nutrient enrichment of natural and semi-natural grasslands from fertiliser use and/or atmospheric nitrogen deposition has led to widespread declines in biodiversity and other ecosystem services 17,47 . These impacts are especially notable when combined with the sowing of productive cultivars to support heavy grazing and/or silage production in intensively managed grasslands 3 . The conversion of natural and semi-natural grasslands to other land uses, such as arable farming, built infrastructure and forestry, is also a major driver of grassland degradation worldwide 36,48 .

        <p>Ongoing climate change also poses a threat to all grasslands, as it causes grassland degradation. Projected future climate change will likely combine with human activities to cause increased woody plant encroachment in some areas and desertification in others 50,51 . For example, natural grasslands in the Americas, Australia and Africa are being degraded due to woody plant encroachment, with the major causes thought to be a combination of higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warmer and wetter conditions, and changes in grazing intensity and timing relative to fire, which is key to episodic tree recruitment 52 . Conversely, in many parts of the world, such as Central Asia and Africa, over-grazing combined with more intense and frequent droughts is exacerbating grassland desertification and degradation 53 .Ongoing climate change also poses a threat to all grasslands, as it causes grassland degradation.

        <p>[H2] Policy recognition of grasslands. National and global policy are needed to recognize the role of grasslands in addressing climate mitigation, food security, biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation. A major factor contributing to the degradation of grasslands is the lack of representation of grassland in national and international policy. In fact, grasslands are often underappreciated, with the scientific and political focus of global sustainability policy being on ecosystems such as oceans, freshwaters, forests and croplands. Indeed, despite suffering some of the highest rates of degradation of any biome, only 8% of grassland and savanna biomes are protected 54 .[H2] Policy recognition of grasslands.

        <p>The reasons for this neglect of grasslands in sustainability policy are unclear, but it likely relates to historical factors and misconceptions about grasslands. For example, natural grasslands are often erroneously considered to be degraded lands or wastelands, a result of human action, or early successional stages of forest, whereas forests are perceived as more productive, pristine ecosystems that are rich in diversity 18,55 . Moreover, natural grasslands primarily occur in areas where climatic and soil factors only allow for relatively low economic benefits to land users, whereas their economic value for the provision of ecosystem services has only been fully recognised over the last twenty years 56 . Another reason for this bias might be that worldwide, forests were the first lands to be converted to agriculture, which has contributed to greater awareness of the consequences of deforestation for biodiversity and society. In contrast, most natural and semi-natural grasslands continued to be grazed at low densities by wild herbivores and livestock until technological barriers hindering agricultural improvement of grasslands and land conversion were overcome. As such, the consequences of large-scale grassland degradation, which are also less obvious than cutting down trees, are newly appreciated 57 .The reasons for this neglect of grasslands in sustainability policy are unclear, but it likely relates to historical factors and misconceptions about grasslands.

        <p>Although grasslands are recognised in some national policies on environment and sustainability, such as China's Grassland Law, numerous prominent examples exist where they have been ignored. For example, halting and reversing ecosystem degradation is a central goal of the SDGs (Goal 15), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), but there is no explicit mention of grasslands in any of them. The SDG targets also fail to mention grasslands, whereas forests, oceans and coastal ecosystems are repeatedly referenced in targets and indicators. Further, while around half the world's 234 Centres of Plant Diversity-sites of global botanical importance based on endemism and species richness-are contained in grassland regions, they were not mentioned in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the CBD. The European Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 also makes little mention of grasslands relative to forests, which feature heavily. Although the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) does aim to protect grasslands, there has been widespread criticism about the effectiveness of the grassland measures for biodiversity conservation in this policy 58 .Although grasslands are recognised in some national policies on environment and sustainability, such as China's Grassland Law, numerous prominent examples exist where they have been ignored.

The European Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 also makes little mention of grasslands relative to forests, which feature heavily. Although the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) does aim to protect grasslands, there has been widespread criticism about the effectiveness of the grassland measures for biodiversity conservation in this policy 58 .</p>
        <p>Pressures on grasslands have also been accentuated through the unforeseen consequences of global and national environmental and socio-economic policies. In particular, natural grasslands are increasingly targeted in carbon sequestration programs that emphasize tree planting, such as REDD+ and China's Grain-to-Green Project, which often leads to their degradation. The Chinese government, for example, has invested heavily in tree planting, with tree coverage of previously non-forested areas increasing at an average rate of 0.15 million hectares per year over the last 25 years 59 . However, there is major concern that tree planting in arid and semi-arid grasslands with water-demanding trees is exacerbating grassland degradation, reducing plant diversity, damaging soils, and increasing water shortages [60][61][62] .Pressures on grasslands have also been accentuated through the unforeseen consequences of global and national environmental and socio-economic policies.

        <p>Similarly, large tracts of natural grassland in Brazil have been identified as targets for tree planting, posing a major threat to these ancient and highly diverse ecosystems 26 . An estimated 7.41 million ha of eucalypt and 2.07 million ha of pine plantation already occupy mostly former savannas and grassland, at a rapid rate of 0.4 million ha per year from 2013-2017 (Ref 63 ). Indeed, it has been calculated that meeting land restoration and protection targets would increase global tree cover by 4 million km 2 , often at the expense of grasslands 64 . Furthermore, models of global forest restoration potential have identified natural grasslands as sites for restoration using tree planting, with potential to contribute to carbon sequestration and climate mitigation 65 . The logic of such proposals for climate mitigation, however, is increasingly been challenged on the basis of their damaging impact on natural grasslands and because their carbon sequestration potential is considered inflated 49,66. Evidence is mounting that grasslands can be more resilient carbon sinks than forests 67 , and afforestation can cause soil carbon loss 68,69 , soil acidification and nutrient-depletion 70 , especially when trees are planted in natural grasslands 68 , which can make them prone to carbon loss from fires 66 . Large-scale afforestation also leads to changes in surface albedo, given that forests absorb more short-wave radiation than grasslands, thereby creating a warming effect 71 .Similarly, large tracts of natural grassland in Brazil have been identified as targets for tree planting, posing a major threat to these ancient and highly diverse ecosystems 26 .

        <p>As such, changes in albedo resulting from afforestation can reduce or even negate benefits of increased carbon capture, potentially leading to a net warming effect of tree planting 71 . Another issue is that policies such as REDD+ focus primarily on carbon sequestration in aboveground tree biomass, while healthy and restored grasslands can store comparable amounts of organic carbon as forests, but mainly belowground 67,72 . Grasslands have also been shown to be more effective than forests in providing soil erosion control and water protection in semi-arid ecosystems 73 , and in some situations the conversion of grassland to forest, either through natural regeneration or afforestation, can be highly detrimental to people who depend on grasslands for forage, game habitat, water reserves, and cultural services 66,74,75. The lack of emphasis on grasslands in international and national policies has a long history. Grasslands in India have been historically undervalued in national policies, and still today they are widely considered to be unproductive wastelands of limited value, leaving them vulnerable to land conversion 76,77 . In Brazil, major progress has been made in the conservation of forest ecosystems, but non-forest biomes-including the Cerrado and Pampas grasslandshave been largely neglected, despite being among the most species rich grasslands in the world 78 . Similarly, and despite their ancient origin, Asian savannas have been considered degraded forest since colonial times, which has led to inappropriate management and policies that promote savanna degradation and loss 77,79 . China's grassland law now includes policies to protect healthy and restore degraded grasslands, and progress being made in certain areas 80 , but was not incorporated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China until 1985.As such, changes in albedo resulting from afforestation can reduce or even negate benefits of increased carbon capture, potentially leading to a net warming effect of tree planting 71 .

        <p>If grasslands are to be valued and managed sustainably, then both global and regional policy must change to recognize the value of grasslands as providers of multiple ecosystem services and hotspots for biodiversity, and to establish targets for their protection and sustainable management. Approaches could comprise specific inclusion of natural and seminatural grasslands in conservation laws and policies and ensuring conservation policies do not have perverse consequences for grasslands, such as promoting fire suppression or afforestation.If grasslands are to be valued and managed sustainably, then both global and regional policy must change to recognize the value of grasslands as providers of multiple ecosystem services and hotspots for biodiversity, and to establish targets for their protection and sustainable management.

        <p>Progress can be made by defining grassland degradation from a socio-ecological perspective, where the severity of degradation and the relative benefits of different grassland restoration practices can be assessed by combining measures of ecosystem service supply and stakeholder priorities and demands 40 . Such measures can show how alternative restoration options differ in their impacts on ecosystem service supply and in their resulting benefits for different stakeholder groups. We recommend that this goal be achieved via a general five-step approach for standardising the assessment of grassland degradation and restoration (Fig. 2).Progress can be made by defining grassland degradation from a socio-ecological perspective, where the severity of degradation and the relative benefits of different grassland restoration practices can be assessed by combining measures of ecosystem service supply and stakeholder priorities and demands 40 .

        <p>The first step is to assess the demand for, and relative priority of, different ecosystem services by multiple stakeholder groups, for instance via social surveys of many stakeholders, or representative community leaders 38,82 (Fig. 2). It is vital that all major stakeholder groups are represented and the full range of relevant ecosystem services considered, including nonmaterial (cultural) benefits. Otherwise, bad management decisions could result and potential conflict 83 . Moreover, it is important that potential power imbalances among stakeholders are addressed, for instance by strengthening and enforcing land use rights of pastoralists and agropastoralists.The first step is to assess the demand for, and relative priority of, different ecosystem services by multiple stakeholder groups, for instance via social surveys of many stakeholders, or representative community leaders 38,82 (Fig. 2).

        <p>Once ecosystem service demand is determined, indicators need to be identified and measured for each of the services (Fig. 2). These should fall into two classes: general indicators, which measure ecosystem services for all stakeholder groups (measured in step two); and specific indicators for services used by a subset of the stakeholder community (measured in step three). The general indicators measured in step two should be inexpensive and easy to measure over large scales, and relate to key regulating functions that underpin all other ecosystem services. Such properties could include the cover and type of vegetation present, aboveground biomass, and soil properties such as organic matter, nutrient content, and pH (Table 1).Once ecosystem service demand is determined, indicators need to be identified and measured for each of the services (Fig. 2).

        <p>While the general indicators proposed above provide broadly comparable information on grassland condition, perceptions of grassland degradation differ between stakeholder groups 84 . Therefore, in addition to general indicators, other variables should be identified locally for these context-specific ecosystem services via stakeholder engagement, and developed according to local conditions (step three). In the French Alps, for example, surveys identified that aesthetic value of mountain grasslands was essential to local farmers and tourists, and related not only to flower diversity, but also to the absence of a build-up of plant litter 85 . As another example, the cover of woody species can be used as an indicator of the vital regulating service of shade provision in East African grasslands 86 . Visually estimable indicators can also be employed in such assessments to ensure both relevance and costeffectiveness.While the general indicators proposed above provide broadly comparable information on grassland condition, perceptions of grassland degradation differ between stakeholder groups 84 .

        <p>In the fourth step, general and specific measures are combined to calculate an integrated index of grassland condition that can be related to local environmental conditions, management factors, global change drivers and restoration management. The creation of such indices can be achieved by adapting approaches developed for measuring the co-delivery of multiple ecosystem services based on stakeholder preferences 40,87 , and other participatory multi-criteria analyses of ecosystem services 88 . Both approaches can also be used to weigh the measures included in the calculation of the index, for example by encouraging representatives of different stakeholder groups to assign scores to the ecosystem services considered 86 .In the fourth step, general and specific measures are combined to calculate an integrated index of grassland condition that can be related to local environmental conditions, management factors, global change drivers and restoration management.

        <p>Deciding on which restoration options are employed and where is best resolved in participatory approaches, so that stakeholders share understanding, and conflict is minimised (Fig. 2). The best options for whole communities can be estimated by weighting stakeholder groups equally in a community level metric, or by evaluating which restoration options minimise trade-offs between groups. As a single restoration practice might not benefit all stakeholder groups, the compartmentalisation of the landscape into different restoration options should also be considered (Fig. 2). The approach presented here would not only allow for more detailed examination of grassland condition with regards to local needs, but also a better means of assessing the severity of grassland degradation and restoration success at both local and larger scales (Figures 3 and4; see Supplementary Material for details on the source of these estimates).Deciding on which restoration options are employed and where is best resolved in participatory approaches, so that stakeholders share understanding, and conflict is minimised (Fig. 2).

        <p>[H2] Shared understanding and trade-offs. When assessing grassland restoration options that best suit different stakeholder groups, there will likely be differences in preferred options (Figs. 3 &amp;4), which might cause disagreement and conflict. To address these differences, there is a need for shared understanding, based on best knowledge and practice and operational constraints, of the potential for different grassland restoration options to supply different ecosystem services 43,89 , which can be quantified using the same tools as described here for assessing degradation. Such an approach could help identify which restoration option might best deliver the needs of all stakeholder groups, thereby supporting resolution of disagreements and conflict.[H2] Shared understanding and trade-offs.

        <p>To illustrate these trade-offs and how they could be resolved, two examples are considered (Figs. 3 and4). In both, fundamental trade-offs caused by degradation and restoration options prevent the co-supply of all ecosystem services. The first example is taken from permanent agricultural grasslands in Europe (Fig. 3), where extensive management promotes functions related to water and soil carbon storage, which support ecosystem services linked to water and climate regulation. In contrast, intensive management with fertiliser use and high grazing pressures leads to faster rates of nutrient cycling and higher plant productivity, thereby promoting provisioning services 42,90 . However, intensive management also reduces plant and soil biodiversity and causes soil compaction, which diminishes the supply of several ecosystem services demanded by stakeholders, leading to reduced overall benefits to stakeholder groups (Fig. 3) 90 . To reverse these impacts, restoration to high diversity grassland can enhance the supply of multiple ecosystem services, and therefore provides substantial benefits to all stakeholder groups. Despite these benefits, the abandonment of agricultural management altogether, which leads to woody plant encroachment, could be the best option to provide some of the benefits prioritized by national decision makers, namely water quality and climate regulation. Given these various trade-offs, and depending on European or national objectives, and on regional conditions 91 , collective choice would likely favour a mosaic of all three grassland types with the restoration of high diversity grassland, accompanied by the segregation of intensive production and climate regulation into specific regions and landscapes 92 .To illustrate these trade-offs and how they could be resolved, two examples are considered (Figs. 3 and4).

        <p>The second example is taken from natural grasslands in arid and semi-arid regions of Eastern Africa (Fig. 4). Here, nomadic pastoralists favour provisioning services of forage production and natural products from grasslands, while charcoal producers derive their livelihoods from native woody vegetation and, increasingly, from invasive woody species such as Prosopis juliflora. Because the invasion of P. juliflora transforms grasslands into scrubland with bare soil 93 , the supply of most ecosystem services demanded by stakeholders is greatly reduced, but fuel wood and charcoal production are promoted 86 . The supply of other services, such as soil carbon storage, is context-dependent; soil conditions are improved when P. juliflora invades grasslands degraded by overgrazing and other forms of mismanagement. However, if undegraded grassland is invaded, the supply of these services is reduced 94 and all stakeholders, apart from charcoal producers, lose ecosystem service benefits and so perceive the invasion as degradation. This example also clearly demonstrates that successful restoration depends on stakeholder perspectives as all restoration options benefit the priority services of some groups, while diminishing those of others. These constraints preclude a single win-winwin restoration option. Therefore, regional-scale restoration that establishes a landscape mosaic, including livestock grazing and patches of conserved or abandoned land, is likely to be required for all three stakeholder groups to be satisfied. It should be noted, however, that such a landscape mosaic would require continuous management of P. juliflora, otherwise it will re-invade grasslands and conserved land.The second example is taken from natural grasslands in arid and semi-arid regions of Eastern Africa (Fig. 4).

        <p>Identifying the presence and cause of trade-offs is a first step towards management and policy solutions to grassland degradation. We suggest that the approaches presented here could be combined as a decision support tool in ecosystem management 95 . This tool can be used as part of a 'landscape approach' to management, which emphasises close collaboration and shared understanding between stakeholder groups to identify and mitigate land management conflicts. Depending on context, this approach could allow for the allocation of different restoration options to different sections of the landscape, as in semi-arid grasslands of Eastern Africa (Figure 4), or the identification of win-win options where a single restoration practice might suit multiple stakeholder groups, such as in European grasslands (Figure 3). These approaches are already considered in existing grassland management approaches, such as the Participatory Rangeland Management (PRM) approach, which has been developed to improve the sustainable management of rangeland resources and their security of access for local rangeland users in arid and semi-arid grasslands 96 . This approach includes a step where stakeholder groups, through extensive meetings, discussions and negotiations, develop a rangeland management agreement that considers the needs of all stakeholder groups involved. This agreement should ultimately become a binding contract document between a representative rangeland management institution and the appropriate government authority. The PRM was initially developed by a consortium including the International Livestock Research Institute in Ethiopia and has been applied in Kenya and Tanzania 97 . A similar approach called Participatory Rangeland Management Planning (PRMP) has been adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 98 .Identifying the presence and cause of trade-offs is a first step towards management and policy solutions to grassland degradation.

        <p>Complex trade-offs might prevent the formulation of simple solutions, and in such situations multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to support deliberation among groups and help steer them towards a compromise where local communities have a voice and multiple perspectives of grassland degradation are accommodated 99,100 . Advanced MCDA approaches also allow for the incorporation of socio-economic factors, such as access rights and ease, and power relationships between stakeholder groups across scales, which will determine the ultimate benefits of ecosystem services to different groups 101 . However, to ensure better outcomes from decision tools such as MCDA it is also important to consider optimal allocation and prioritisation of limiting resources to actions 102 , especially since funds for grassland restoration are often limited.Complex trade-offs might prevent the formulation of simple solutions, and in such situations multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be used to support deliberation among groups and help steer them towards a compromise where local communities have a voice and multiple perspectives of grassland degradation are accommodated 99,100 .

        <p>Case studies reporting technical solutions to grassland degradation at scales of hundreds to thousands of hectares are particularly scarce, especially for developing countries in semi-arid and arid regions of the world. However, previous efforts indicate that grassland restoration is feasible, at least starting from low levels of degradation, and that technical and socioecological solutions often need to be combined to achieve long-term management goals (Box 1). For example, steppe grasslands in Inner Mongolia are challenged with a diverse set of stakeholder demands, including the need for environmental services, such as increased soil carbon storage, the local herders' wish to retain traditional livelihoods while increasing their income, and an increasing demand for red meat by the wider population in China and elsewhere 80 . To address these demands of various stakeholder groups, a grassland management system was developed that built on optimizing income from livestock production per unit area, which was achieved by increasing animal growth rates (and thus reaching marketable size earlier) by decreasing livestock numbers by approximately 50% 80 . Thus, the system created a win-win situation by improving local herders' income and enabling the recovery of steppe and associated ecosystem services (Box 1.Case studies reporting technical solutions to grassland degradation at scales of hundreds to thousands of hectares are particularly scarce, especially for developing countries in semi-arid and arid regions of the world.

However, the uptake of technical solutions for restoring degraded grasslands depends on socio-economic factors, including reconciliation with traditional landtenure systems, well-established communication pathways, and supporting institutional settings and policies (Box 1. For example, implementation of sustainable grassland management in Inner Mongolia benefits from efforts of the Chinese government to emphasize sustainable grassland management in agricultural policies 108 . The success of the grazing exclosure programme in northern Ethiopia will depend on successful communication and negotiations between local stakeholder groups and policy, and among local stakeholders to ensure land use enforcement and sharing of management responsibilities and harvesting benefits 109 .In northern Ethiopia, several years of excluding livestock from degraded communal grazing lands led to the recovery of plant species richness, forage and wood production, and soil health, and thus helped to improve the supply of services prioritised by local stakeholders 106,107 .

        <p>[H2] Research innovation: Innovations in environmental research need to be developed and employed to improve the assessment of grassland degradation and provide novel solutions to restoration and sustainable grassland management. At a global and regional scale, developments in remote sensing offer potential to evaluate both the extent and status of grasslands and inform the spatial targeting of large-scale restoration efforts. For example, maps of general degradation indicators, such as primary productivity, standing biomass, soil moisture, phenology, soil organic carbon [110][111][112] , could be combined with spatial information on climate, edaphic and socio-economic data to identify national and global patterns of grassland degradation and pin-point locations where restoration efforts could have the greatest impact.[H2] Research innovation: Innovations in environmental research need to be developed and employed to improve the assessment of grassland degradation and provide novel solutions to restoration and sustainable grassland management.

        <p>There has been a boom in research directed at grassland management for sustainable agroecosystems since the turn of the 21 st Century, leading to improved grazing and fertiliser management, and reduced reliance on external inputs, nutrient losses and emissions of greenhouse gases 115 . However, new ecological understanding could also facilitate grassland restoration. For example, new research could enable landscape and regional scale restoration of inter-connected grasslands in regions where semi-natural grassland remnants are fragmented and persist within a matrix of forested or intensive agriculture land uses. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that grassland dynamics and function are enhanced by connectivity that encourages flows of species and biogeochemical processes 116,117 . In theory, such spatial networks have improved resilience to perturbations, such as climate extremes, and the ability to adapt to a changing environment 118 . These emerging concepts on landscape design could also be applied to the restoration of ecological flows of species and processes within landscapes 119,120 , and at a practical level, there is already considerable opportunity to trial these approaches in large-scale restoration programmes 121 . Such approaches also require improved understanding of the tele-coupling of different landscape elements, whereby human-induced processes in one area impact on distant areas. For example, pastoralists in arid regions depend on grazing areas along major water bodies, which are also of interest to other stakeholders for crop production or biodiversity conservation 122 . Loss of such grazing areas forces pastoralists to overgraze rain-fed grasslands elsewhere, leading grassland degradation 123 .There has been a boom in research directed at grassland management for sustainable agroecosystems since the turn of the 21 st Century, leading to improved grazing and fertiliser management, and reduced reliance on external inputs, nutrient losses and emissions of greenhouse gases 115 .

        <p>Another fast-developing area of ecological research that could assist grassland restoration programmes concerns the application of knowledge of aboveground-belowground interactions 124,125 . A wealth of studies show that high grassland plant diversity can enhance multiple ecosystem functions, both above-and belowground, and increase the resistance of plant production to environmental perturbations, such as climate extremes [126][127][128] ; such knowledge could be applied to degraded grassland to restore ecosystem functions and their resilience to environmental change 129,130 . Benefits can also be realised through informed selection of plant species based on functional traits, especially root traits, which has been shown to be an effective way of enhancing grassland multifunctionality 131 and the physical properties of degraded soils 132 . Research points to the potential of soil inoculation and plant translocation from donor sites to enhance the recovery of degraded ecosystems and steer plant community development 133,134 . Further, there is increasing awareness that diversifying livestock promotes plant diversity and grassland multifunctionality 135 , especially at moderate levels of grazing 136 , and that interventions can facilitate robust multi-trophic interactions in restored ecosystems could benefit restoration 137 .Another fast-developing area of ecological research that could assist grassland restoration programmes concerns the application of knowledge of aboveground-belowground interactions 124,125 .

        <p>A potential hurdle to the adoption of new research innovation is that the majority of scientific knowledge underpinning grassland restoration comes from studies done at a local scale and in a handful of regions, especially North America, Australasia and Europe. As such, there is a need for new, long-term research to underpin approaches to large-scale restoration of degraded grasslands, especially in Asia, Africa and South America where grassland degradation is widespread 138 . One solution to these geographic gaps might be the use of metalevel analyses [139][140] and data collection using standardised methodology from globally distributed grassland studies such as the Nutrient Network 141 and HerbDivNet 142 . These can help to identify generalisable impacts of biotic and environmental drivers and disturbances, such as grazing and nutrient enrichment, on grassland diversity and function, that could be transferred to regions where data is lacking. However, that large gaps in environmental and management conditions still need to be filled, and the ecological context will affect the specific applicability of any generalisations 143 . At all scales, new technology and practices need to be embedded within socio-ecological approaches to grassland restoration to ensure empowerment of local people and best outcomes for their quality of life.A potential hurdle to the adoption of new research innovation is that the majority of scientific knowledge underpinning grassland restoration comes from studies done at a local scale and in a handful of regions, especially North America, Australasia and Europe.

        <p>[H1] Summary and future perspectives Despite progress in understanding the causes and consequences of grassland degradation, and in developing restoration techniques, there remain many barriers to halting grassland degradation and effective restoration. Here, we have argued that overcoming these barriers requires an integrated socio-ecological approach to grassland degradation and restoration, which not only demands greater recognition of grasslands in global policy, but standardised approaches for assessing grassland degradation and restoration success. It also requires the adoption of innovations in environmental science for detecting grassland degradation and enhancing restoration success, along with enhanced knowledge transfer and data sharing regarding restoration experiences.[H1] Summary and future perspectives Despite progress in understanding the causes and consequences of grassland degradation, and in developing restoration techniques, there remain many barriers to halting grassland degradation and effective restoration.

        <p>Many examples exist of national and international sustainability policies that have ignored grasslands, including the SDGs and CBD. Giving due attention in sustainability policy to grasslands and the ecosystem services they provide, on a par with other biomes such as forests, is therefore essential for the future protection of healthy grasslands and restoration of those that are degraded. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) and CBD post-2020 global biodiversity framework provides an opportunity to set future targets for the protection, sustainable management and restoration of grasslands, and prevent damaging practices such as the planting of trees in natural grasslands 144 . Put simply, if grasslands are to be managed sustainably, then both global and regional policy must be revised to recognize the value of grasslands for multiple ecosystem services and establish targets for their protection, restoration and sustainable management.Many examples exist of national and international sustainability policies that have ignored grasslands, including the SDGs and CBD.

Furthermore, while the Aichi targets of the CBD largely ignored grasslands, and the draft of its post-2020 framework lacks specificity, the most recent synthesis of the proposals of the parties includes mentions of grasslands (albeit other ecosystems such as forest and wetlands are discussed more frequently).There is hope in some initiatives, though.

        <p>Whilst we demonstrate how our five-step approach can be applied using specific case studies, future research is needed to test this approach in different contexts and at local and larger scales. Research is also needed to better understand different societal perceptions of grasslands and the reasons why they have been neglected in sustainability policy, to develop and test promising new ways of assessing grassland degradation and restoration, and to harness ecological knowledge for restoration success. This aim will require ambitious, interdisciplinary national and international research programmes of the kind that could be facilitated by major research and innovation schemes targeted at achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

These include the assessment of demand for different ecosystem services by stakeholders (step 1) and identification of universal (step 2) and specific (step 3) ecosystem service, the evaluation of grassland restoration and identification of restoration options (step 4), and the shared selection and implementation of restoration strategy (step 5).

        <p>Restoration options have differing impacts on stakeholder groups. Sustainable livestock grazing (SR2) requires fencing off or access restriction but promotes ES supply more than conservation (SR1) and supports the greatest multifunctionality (MF) from the perspective of all the considered groups. Abandonment does not restore the supply of any ES and even incurs ES losses (SR3), because P. juliflora consumes substantial amounts of groundwater.
