        <p>We developed an analytical stomatal optimization model based on xylem hydraulics (SOX) to predict plant responses to drought. Coupling SOX to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) LSM, we conducted a global evaluation of SOX against leaf-and ecosystemlevel observations. SOX simulates leaf stomatal conductance responses to climate for woody plants more accurately and parsimoniously than the existing JULES stomatal conductance model. An ecosystem-level evaluation at 70 eddy flux sites shows that SOX decreases the sensitivity of gross primary productivity (GPP) to soil moisture, which improves the model agreement with observations and increases the predicted annual GPP by 30% in relation to JULES. SOX decreases JULES root-mean-square error in GPP by up to 45% in evergreen tropical forests, and can simulate realistic patterns of canopy water potential and soil water dynamics at the studied sites.We developed an analytical stomatal optimization model based on xylem hydraulics (SOX) to predict plant responses to drought.

        <p>Large areas of the globe will be exposed to increased aridity in the near future (Sheffield &amp; Wood, 2008;Duffy et al., 2015;Marengo et al., 2018). As drought events become more intense and frequent, accurately representing vegetation-climate feedbacks in Earth system models (ESMs) is increasingly important, as these interactions can drastically influence model projections of global climate change (Cox et al., 2000). The current generation of land surface models (LSMs) does not accurately simulate vegetation carbon dynamics during drought (Sitch et al., 2008;Powell et al., 2013;Medlyn et al., 2016;Ukkola et al., 2016;Restrepo-Coupe et al., 2017;Rogers et al., 2017;Eller et al., 2018b), thereby restricting our capability to predict the effect of increased aridity on vegetation distribution and its feedbacks on the global carbon cycle and climate. Many LSMs represent the effects of reduced soil moisture on canopy carbon assimilation (A) using an empirical drought factor commonly referred as bfactor (Cox et al., 1998). The b-factor approach has been shown to overestimate plant responses to seasonal and experimentally induced drought (Ukkola et al., 2016;Restrepo-Coupe et al., 2017;Eller et al., 2018b). The b-factor has a large impact on the modelled global carbon budget, supressing 30-40% of the annual gross primary productivity (GPP) in large areas of arid and semiarid ecosystems (Trugman et al., 2018). Despite its importance, there is scarce empirical support for the drought functions used in most LSMs (Medlyn et al., 2016). The lack of a theoretical or empirical basis for the b-factor implies an urgent need for new modelling approaches to replace this important component of LSMs so as to improve our capacity to predict vegetation-climate interactions.Large areas of the globe will be exposed to increased aridity in the near future (Sheffield &amp; Wood, 2008;Duffy et al., 2015;Marengo et al., 2018).

        <p>Stomatal responses of plants to soil drought involve complex chemical signalling and hydrodynamic processes in leaf cells, some of which have not been entirely elucidated (Buckley, 2017(Buckley, , 2019;;Qu et al., 2019). Stomatal optimization models are a useful approach to model stomatal behaviour that circumvents the need to explicitly represent the physiological processes involved in stomatal regulation. Optimization models employ a 'goal-oriented' approach, assuming that plant stomata behaviour has been selected through plant evolutionary history to maximize a given objective function (Cowan, 2002;Dewar et al., 2009;Prentice et al., 2014;Buckley, 2017). The traditional approach to model optimal stomatal behaviour is derived from the seminal work of Cowan &amp; Farquhar (1977). This approach proposes that optimal stomatal behaviour maximizes A minus the carbon cost of water lost (kE) over a given time interval, where E is transpiration and k is the Lagrange multiplier that represents the carbon cost of a unit of water lost. This model, hereafter labelled CF, after Cowan and Farquhar, is capable of simulating many patterns of stomatal responses to climate over short timescales (Farquhar et al., 1980;Berninger &amp; Hari, 1993), and has provided the theoretical basis for several widely used semi-empirical stomatal models (Jacobs, 1994;Leuning, 1995;Medlyn et al., 2011). However, CF predicts that stomatal conductance (g s ) increases in response to elevated CO 2 when A is Rubisco-limited, which contradicts most observations (Mott, 1988;Medlyn et al., 2001). Other limitations are related to the k, as the CF hypothesis does not link k to measurable plant traits or environmental quantities (Buckley, 2017), and assumes k is constant over the period of reference (Cowan &amp; Farquhar, 1977), which makes the original CF unable to predict long-term g s decline in response to soil moisture depletion.Stomatal responses of plants to soil drought involve complex chemical signalling and hydrodynamic processes in leaf cells, some of which have not been entirely elucidated (Buckley, 2017(Buckley, , 2019;;Qu et al., 2019).

        <p>Since the original CF work, many attempts have been made to incorporate the effects of declining soil moisture in the CF stomatal optimization framework (Cowan, 1986;M€ akel€ a et al., 1996;Williams et al., 1996;Manzoni et al., 2013). Some of these attempts, such as the soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) model of Williams et al. (1996), employ principles of plant hydraulics to constrain stomatal optimization and have been successfully incorporated into LSMs (Bonan et al., 2014). The numerical approach used by SPA employs a hydraulic threshold to set a lower water potential limit (Ψ min ) for g s , which simulates a strict isohydric stomatal regulation (Fisher et al., 2006). Despite using plant hydraulics, SPA still relies on a water-use efficiency optimization similar to CF to model stomatal behaviour when Ψ &gt; Ψ min (Williams et al., 1996;Bonan et al., 2014).Since the original CF work, many attempts have been made to incorporate the effects of declining soil moisture in the CF stomatal optimization framework (Cowan, 1986;M€ akel€ a et al., 1996;Williams et al., 1996;Manzoni et al., 2013).

        <p>Alternative routes to model plant optimal stomatal behaviour have been proposed recently (for a review, see Mencuccini et al., 2019a). These approaches circumvent the CF limitations by assuming that plant optimal stomatal behaviour minimizes the instantaneous fitness costs associated with low Ψ. These new optimization models use widely available plant hydraulic traits (Kattge et al., 2011;Choat et al., 2012) to simulate g s responses to environmental conditions, producing a realistic g s decline in response to elevated atmospheric CO 2 and soil drought (Sperry et al., 2017;Venturas et al., 2018;Eller et al., 2018b;Wang et al., 2019). This approach predicts a tight coordination between stomatal and xylem functioning which is widely corroborated by observations (Hubbard et al., 2001;Meinzer et al., 2009;Klein, 2014). Another advantage of this approach is its capacity to simulate a diversity of contrasting stomatal behaviours, from iso-to anisohydric (Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2014;Klein, 2014). Sperry et al. (2017) proposes a model that assumes that, as xylem hydraulic conductance declines, the increased risk of hydraulic failure is the main fitness cost associated with low Ψ. (Friend, 1995), which assumes that stomata optimize plant dry matter production, represented by the product of photosynthesis and a linear function of Ψ. The SOX model in Eller et al. (2018b) uses a numerical routine to find the optimum g s . However, the PGEN optimization target can also be found analytically (Friend &amp; Cox, 1995;Dewar et al., 2018). A parsimonious analytical formulation for SOX would facilitate its incorporation into existing LSMs and provide a practical alternative to the b-function for modelling stomatal responses to drought at global scales.Alternative routes to model plant optimal stomatal behaviour have been proposed recently (for a review, see Mencuccini et al., 2019a).

        <p>In this study we develop an analytical approximation for the numerical SOX model presented in Eller et al. (2018b). We then create a new configuration for the 
            <rs type="creator">Joint</rs> UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES; Best et al., 2011;Clark et al., 2011) that uses SOX to compute vegetation g s from environmental and plant hydraulic data. Using a global dataset of xylem hydraulic traits, together with an extensive leaf gas-exchange and eddy covariance dataset, we calibrate the SOX parameters and compare the JULES-SOX performance to the default JULES using the bfunction, across all major global biomes. Our goals in this paper are twofold: to test SOX agreement with global observations of g s to assess the generality of the underlying hypothesis in SOX, that is, that plant stomata evolved to balance carbon assimilation with the loss of hydraulic conductance; and to evaluate the effect of SOX on JULES ecosystem-scale predictions of carbon and water fluxes, and their agreement with observations.

        <p>The model predictive skill was evaluated using the model rootmean-square errors (RMSE) and the Nash &amp; Sutcliffe (1970) model efficiency index (NSE).

In 10 of these sites we also had data for surface (5-15 cm) soil moisture content, which was used to evaluate the model soil moisture dynamics predictions. We classified the land cover on each site using the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification (Loveland et al., 2000). Each site was classified as one of the following categories according to its prescribed PFT cover (Table S2): cropland (CRO), deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), temperate evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF-Te), tropical evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF-Tr), evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), grassland (GRA), mixed forest (MF), savannah (SAV), shrubland (SHR) and wetlands (WET). We grouped the IGBP categories open and closed shrublands into SHR, as we only had a single closed shrubland site. Similarly, woody savannah was grouped with SAV, as we only had two woody savannah sites. We divided the evergreen broad leaf forests category into EBF-Te and EBF-Tr, as these sites were dominated by distinct PFTs (BET-Te and BET-Tr, respectively).

        <p>The JULES and JULES-SOX configurations used in this study employed the 10-layer canopy scheme with sunlit and shaded leaves in each layer as described in Clark et al. (2011). The canopy radiation profile was given by the two-stream approach from Sellers (1985), with the sun-fleck penetration scheme from Mercado et al. (2009), and an exponential decrease of photosynthetic capacity through the canopy (Mercado et al., 2007). All the model runs used in this study were site-level simulations driven with hourly local meteorological data. Vegetation dynamics (Cox, 2001) was turned off and the site PFT coverage by site was prescribed based on the site vegetation description obtained from the site principal investigators (Table S2) or information from the site available on the

These properties were derived from data collected at each site or, when local data were not available, calculated from the sand/silt/ clay fractions in the nearest gridbox in the high-resolution input file to the Met Office Central Ancillary Program (Dharssi et al., 2009), using approximations from Cosby et al. (1984). The model was spun up by recycling the meteorological data at each site for up to 50 yr.

        <p>The SOX analytical approximation (Eqns 4, 5) has g s responses to climate which are consistent with the patterns commonly reported in the literature (Mott, 1988;Leuning, 1995;Dewar et al., 2018). The g s responses to I par and c a in SOX (Fig. 1a) are given by the @A/@c i gradient decreasing at low light because of the changes in the light response curve, as A starts being limited by light (Notes S3), or at high c a (Notes S2). SOX correctly predicted stomatal closure in response to increased c a under Rubisco-limited conditions (Mott, 1988;Fig. 1a). The classical exponential g s responses to D (Leuning, 1995) was reproduced in SOX (Fig. 1a) through the D effect on ξ (Eqn 5; Fig. S1a). An exponential g s decline was also predicted by SOX in response to decreasing Ψ pd (Fig. 1a), which summarizes both the responses to the soil water availability in the root zone and the hydraulic stress of transporting water to the top of the canopy (Eqn S1.2 in Notes S1). The plant hydraulic parameters modulated the model sensitivity to D or Ψ pd (Fig. 1b-d), with a less negative Ψ 50 or a higher r pmin increasing the g s sensitivity to Ψ pd and D (Fig. 1c,d).

        <p>Default JULES significantly underestimated the observed mean annual GPP by 143.3 g C m À2 across all biomes, which corresponds to 13.6% of the observed mean annual GPP (Fig. 5b). JULES-SOX deviation from the observed mean annual GPP was considerably smaller (71.6 g C m À2 ; Fig. 5b). The significantly lower annual GPP predicted by default JULES can be attributed to b-function-induced GPP declines, which also produced a stronger GPP seasonality than is present in the data (Fig. 5c). JULES overestimated the median observed GPP seasonality by 70%, compared with a 13% overestimation by JULES-SOX (Fig. 5c). This difference means JULES predicts 17% of the sites have a markedly seasonal GPP with a Seasonality Index (SI; Walsh &amp; Lawler, 1981) higher than 0.8, while just 4% of the sites actually have SI &gt; 0.8. JULES-SOX predicts only 8% of the sites would have SI &gt; 0.8. The light-use efficiency (LUE; Fig. 6) is the ratio between GPP and the I par absorbed by the canopy (Stocker et al., 2018), and can be used to disentangle the effects of soil moisture and light availability controlling the vegetation GPP. The JULES LUE declined as soil dried out, with a mean linear slope of 1.21 (AE 0.1) across all biomes. By contrast, the JULES-SOX LUE-soil moisture relationship had a mean slope of 0.73 (AE 0.21), with some biomes, such as DBF, reaching a slope as low as 0.22 (Fig. 6b).

        <p>We report the first evaluation of a LSM using a stomatal optimization model fully based on xylem hydraulics to drive the vegetation stomatal responses to climate. Our results provide support for the SOX underlying hypothesis that stomata evolved to balance carbon assimilation with instantaneous hydraulic conductance loss. The risk of mortality through hydraulic failure (Choat et al., 2012;Rowland et al., 2015;Anderegg et al., 2016;Adams et al., 2017) should drive the evolution of mechanisms to prevent the plant from reaching lethal embolism thresholds (Sperry, 2004). There is abundant evidence that stomata controls xylem tension, and consequently embolism (Hubbard et al., 2001;Brodribb et al., 2003;Meinzer et al., 2009;Klein, 2014).

        <p>Whereas our model fits the observations of most PFTs better than its empirical alternative, there is still a considerable amount of unexplained variance in the data (Fig. 2). This can be partially attributed to the large hydraulic heterogeneity within each PFT, but we must also acknowledge that many processes not directly related to xylem hydraulics are important to plant life history and stomatal evolution. Processes related to nutrient use and acquisition, carbohydrate allocation and storage, the maintenance of tissues and biochemical apparatus, and protection from pathogens and herbivores (Melotto et al., 2008;Cramer et al., 2009;Prentice et al., 2014) could all explain part of our model residual variance. It is extremely important to explore the relevance of these processes in future research on stomatal optimality. However, the SOX model as we propose it already provides a parsimonious alternative to the empirical models commonly used in LSMs.Whereas our model fits the observations of most PFTs better than its empirical alternative, there is still a considerable amount of unexplained variance in the data (Fig. 2).

These results show the potential of using plant hydraulics to model the stomatal behaviour of plants across contrasting environmental conditions, and supports its use in ESMs to project the evolution of global climate.Our findings that xylem hydraulics-based models can adequately simulate stomatal behaviour agree with other recent studies.

        <p>The analytical formulation developed for SOX facilitates its coupling to LSMs, allowing the host LSM to constrain its predictions using plant hydraulic information. We show that inclusion of plant hydraulics in JULES through SOX improves its capabilities to simulate GPP and soil moisture dynamics in most of the studied biomes (Figs 345). In addition, SOX opens new possibilities to evaluate LSM predictions and expands the range of hypotheses that can be tested with JULES. Using JULES-SOX within ESMs will allow us to understand how hydraulic processes affect climatic and biogeochemical cycles at the global scale, as well as to investigate the role of plant hydraulics on vegetation distribution and its response to climate change.The analytical formulation developed for SOX facilitates its coupling to LSMs, allowing the host LSM to constrain its predictions using plant hydraulic information.

        <p>Other LSMs and DGVMs have already successfully employed principles of plant hydraulics (Hickler et al., 2006;Bonan et al., 2014;Kennedy et al., 2019), but JULES-SOX is the first LSM to use the new generation of hydraulically based stomatal optimization models (Wolf et al., 2016;Sperry et al., 2017;Anderegg et al., 2018b;Eller et al., 2018b) to predict stomatal responses to climate. The SPA (Williams et al., 1996) adaptation to the community land model (CLM) by Bonan et al. (2014) was one of the first approaches to link plant stomatal function to plant hydraulic processes in a LSM. Despite SPA being an extremely useful model, SOX has an advantage in circumstances where assuming a strict isohydric behaviour is not appropriate (Klein, 2014;Martinez-Vilalta et al., 2014).

        <p>Recently, Kennedy et al. (2019) implemented a plant hydraulic scheme (PHS) in a CLM. The PHS simulates dynamic changes in hydraulic conductance in different compartments along the soil-atmosphere continuum, providing a more detailed representation than SOX of hydraulic processes occurring along the soil-plant hydraulic pathway. However, PHS still requires empirical parameters to represent stomatal responses to soil drought and D (Kennedy et al., 2019), namely the g 0 and g 1 parameters from the Medlyn et al. (2011) model, and the critical and wilting points used in the empirical stress factor. The main advantage of SOX is providing an alternative to the b-function and empirical stomatal parameters by linking plant hydraulic processes directly to stomatal functioning. As we treat the soilplant-atmosphere pathway as a single hydraulic compartment, SOX only requires the hydraulic parameters r pmin , Ψ 50 and a to predict stomatal responses to climate. This makes SOX even more parsimonious than default JULES, which requires four empirical parameters to simulate stomatal responses to climate (Eqns 7, 8) and does not simulate any aspect of vegetation hydraulic functioning (Clark et al., 2011).Recently, Kennedy et al.

        <p>We show that the SOX hydraulic parameters in most PFTs can be constrained with plant branch-level hydraulic observations (Table 2), which is an advantage over models that employ empirical parameters difficult to constrain and interpret biologically. However, we observed discrepancies between the SOX-calibrated parameters and the observed hydraulic traits in certain PFTs (Table 2). In some cases, such as NDT, the parameter discrepancy may have been a result of a very restricted observational sampling of hydraulic parameters in this group. The NDT only had Ψ 50 data for five species and a and r pmin for two species (Table 2). Considering that the observations used in this study were not collected in the same FLUXNET sites used to evaluate SOX, some of the observed discrepancies between calibrated and measured parameters might reflect hydraulic differences between 2). In Eller et al. (2018b) a numerical version of SOX outperformed the b-function approach when parameterized with locally measured branch-level hydraulic data from EBF-Tr. These findings suggest that SOX can be constrained with in situ hydraulic measurements when these are available. However, we must also consider the possibility that there are intrinsic limitations in using branch-level hydraulic data to parameterize the model. Roots and leaves can be more vulnerable to embolism than branches (Bartlett et al., 2016;Wolfe et al., 2016), which can make these tissues bottleneck plant hydraulic conductance during drought. The soil outside the roots can also limit plant hydraulic conductance and, ultimately, control its water use (Fisher et al., 2007). These bottlenecks could bias the SOX-calibrated hydraulic parameters towards the limiting component and explain its departure from the branch-level hydraulic data. In this case, SOX parameterization would benefit from the use of more integrative methodologies to estimate hydraulic parameters that represent the entire soil-plant hydraulic vulnerability (Eller et al., 2018a). Alternatively, the SOX structure (i.e. the K function in Eqn 2) would need to explicitly represent the variability between different hydraulic compartments along the soil-plant-atmosphere pathway, similar to SPA or other models (Eller et al., 2018b;Kennedy et al., 2019;Mencuccini et al., 2019b).We show that the SOX hydraulic parameters in most PFTs can be constrained with plant branch-level hydraulic observations (Table 2), which is an advantage over models that employ empirical parameters difficult to constrain and interpret biologically.

        <p>Stomatal optimization based on xylem hydraulics improved JULES GPP simulation in over 70% of the 70 studied sites, and soil moisture dynamics in 80% of the 10 sites where soil moisture data were available. This improved fit was achieved using hydraulic parameters calibrated against the GPP data of a small subset of eddy flux sites (the sites in Fig. S2), which suggests that the calibrated parameters are generic enough to be used in global simulations. The lower sensitivity of SOX to soil moisture improved the simulations of annual GPP (Fig. 5) and predicted terrestrial biomes to assimilate on average 2.58 Mg C ha À1 yr À1 or 30% more than predicted by default JULES. This increased carbon assimilation could affect Earth's atmospheric CO 2 (Cox et al., 2000;Winkler et al., 2019).Stomatal optimization based on xylem hydraulics improved JULES GPP simulation in over 70% of the 70 studied sites, and soil moisture dynamics in 80% of the 10 sites where soil moisture data were available.

        <p>The JULES-SOX model particularly improved the fit of EBF-Tr sites to the observations (Fig. 5; Table 3), using hydraulic parameters very similar to those observed in BET-Tr (Table 2). Considering that SOX is also able to capture the response of EBF-Tr even to extreme experimental drought (Eller et al., 2018b), JULES-SOX may contribute to decrease the large uncertainty in how these important ecosystems will respond to climate change (Sitch et al., 2008). Tropical forest productivity estimated by SOX is less sensitive to seasonal soil drought (Figs 3, S4), which is consistent with the little seasonality often observed in tropical forest-atmosphere CO 2 exchange (Grace et al., 1995;Carswell et al., 2002;Alden et al., 2016), as well as to forest responses to experimental drought (Meir et al., 2009;da Costa et al., 2010;Meir et al., 2018). da Costa et al. (2018) showed that even after 15 yr of partial rainfall exclusion, Amazon trees can maintain or even increase their transpiration rates (albeit following significant mortality). Whereas tropical forest resistance to drought has previously been attributed only to deep roots possessed by the vegetation (Nepstad et al., 1994), our results indicate that plants more resistant to embolism could maintain their carbon assimilation during drought even without a deeper root system.The JULES-SOX model particularly improved the fit of EBF-Tr sites to the observations (Fig. 5; Table 3), using hydraulic parameters very similar to those observed in BET-Tr (Table 2).

        <p>The unavoidable consequence of maintaining stomatal gas exchange during soil drought is a greater depletion of soil moisture reserves (Figs 6, S4, S7). This behaviour is a direct consequence of the main assumption in SOX, which reflects a 'use or lose it' stomatal regulation strategy with respect to soil moisture (Sperry et al., 2017). SOX assumes plants with a more conservative water-use strategy will be outcompeted by neighbouring plants with a less conservative stomatal behaviour (Wolf et al., 2016). The demographic consequences of the stomatal regulation strategy embedded in SOX should be explored in future studies using the dynamic vegetation component of JULES (Cox, 2001;Moore et al., 2018). The more competitive soil moisture dynamics predicted by SOX, together with a more accurate representation of vegetation drought-induced mortality, which also can be developed from SOX, might be the key to predicting sudden and widespread vegetation die-off during droughts that have been increasingly reported in ecosystems around the globe (Allen et al., 2010;Worrall et al., 2010;Meir et al., 2015).
