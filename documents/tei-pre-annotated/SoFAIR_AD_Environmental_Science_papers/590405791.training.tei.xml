        <p>Forest restoration is being scaled-up globally to deliver critical ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits, yet we lack rigorous comparison of co-benefit delivery across different restoration approaches. In a global synthesis, we use 25,950 matched data pairs from 264 studies in 53 countries to assess how delivery of climate, soil, water, and wood production services as well as biodiversity compares across a range of tree plantations and native forests. Carbon storage, water provisioning, and especially soil erosion control and biodiversity benefits are all delivered better by native forests, with compositionally simpler, younger plantations in drier regions performing particularly poorly. However, plantations exhibit an advantage in wood production. These results underscore important trade-offs among environmental and production goals that policymakers must navigate in meeting forest restoration commitments.Forest restoration is being scaled-up globally to deliver critical ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits, yet we lack rigorous comparison of co-benefit delivery across different restoration approaches.

        <p>As the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration gets underway (1), forest restoration on degraded and deforested land is being scaled-up globally, with far-reaching environmental and social implications (2)(3)(4). The Bonn Challenge alone pledges to restore 350 million hectares of land by 2030 (5), and many other initiatives are similarly ambitious (6,7). Large-scale programs to restore forests are frequently motivated by a desire to recover ecosystem services such as carbon storage (8), soil erosion control (9), water provisioning (10), and wood production (11). Based on an implicit assumption that these services can be effectively delivered by forests regardless of their composition, these programs frequently gravitate toward reforesting with compositionally simple tree plantations rather than restoring native forests (7,10,12). However, this premise has yet to be tested rigorously using paired data that limit potential confounding factors (13) (Supplementary Text). This is a critically important omission for reasons beyond the target ecosystem services per se, because by having limited (14) and at times negative (9) effects on native biodiversity, a focus on tree plantations risks severely limiting the conservation potential of large-scale forest restoration, in turn hampering progress toward global commitments to halt and reverse biodiversity loss (15)(16)(17) and ecosystem degradation (1).As the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration gets underway (1), forest restoration on degraded and deforested land is being scaled-up globally, with far-reaching environmental and social implications (2)(3)(4).

        <p>We present a global synthesis of paired data from the world's main forest biomes to assess the merits of forest restoration approaches, in particular reforesting with tree plantations versus restoring native forests, on deforested land that would have been naturally forested in recent history (Materials and Methods (18)). We compare the performance of a range of compositionally simple tree plantations spanning a wide spectrum of management regimes ('tree plantations' hereafter (18)) versus native forests (including restored and pre-existing native forests) in delivering the key ecosystem services of carbon storage, soil erosion control, water provisioning, and wood production, as well as in supporting biodiversity. We further assess how variation in the relative performance of tree plantations versus native forests may be explained by plantation features and biophysical conditions. Our study aims to enable forest restoration to achieve co-benefits in addressing today's multiple environmental challenges (4), including the dual climate and biodiversity crises (8,17). By simultaneously considering forests' performance in carbon, soil, water, and biodiversity (i.e. environmental outcomes), plus in wood production, our study also provides a critical assessment of the trade-offs likely to confront forest restoration decision-makers.We present a global synthesis of paired data from the world's main forest biomes to assess the merits of forest restoration approaches, in particular reforesting with tree plantations versus restoring native forests, on deforested land that would have been naturally forested in recent history (Materials and Methods (18)).

        <p>For each environmental outcome, we identified the most informative metric with a reasonable amount of empirical data: aboveground biomass (Mg ha -1 ), amount of eroded soil (kg m -2 y -1 ), catchment-or plot-scale water yield (% of rainfall), and species-specific abundance (individuals ha -1 , compiled for each species in a given ecological community; see (18) for rationale of metric choices). Searching the peer-reviewed and grey literature and corresponding with authors, we compiled pairs of data that involved a tree plantation (classified into three types) and a matching native forest (classified into four types; Fig. 1A) from the same study system (18). For wood production, we compiled pairs of empirical data on wood yield (m 3 ha -1 ) or profit (USD ha -1 ) that involved a tree plantation and a matching restored native forest (Fig. 1A) over equal time horizons (18); we excluded native forests not resulting from restoration because the sustainability of their wood harvest could rarely be confirmed. Given the paucity of paired wood production data, we relaxed the matching requirement to also compile annualized yield data just from restored native forests (m 3 ha -1 y -1 ; (18)), which we compared with known annualized yields of some of the world's main monoculture plantations (19).For each environmental outcome, we identified the most informative metric with a reasonable amount of empirical data: aboveground biomass (Mg ha -1 ), amount of eroded soil (kg m -2 y -1 ), catchment-or plot-scale water yield (% of rainfall), and species-specific abundance (individuals ha -1 , compiled for each species in a given ecological community; see (18) for rationale of metric choices).

        <p>We assessed the rigor of matching for each data pair and weighed it accordingly in subsequent analyses (18). We calculated a log response ratio (RR; ln(tree plantation over native forest)) from each data pair to represent the relative performance of tree plantations versus native forests; we reversed the RR signs for eroded soil to represent soil erosion control. In total, our searches ((18); Fig. S1; Tables S1-S3) yielded 25,535 RRs for species-specific abundance on 13 species groups from 405 plantation-native forest pairs, 146 RRs for aboveground biomass, 82 RRs for eroded soil, 167 RRs for water yield, and 20 RRs for wood production, from 264 studies in 53 countries (Fig. 1; Table S4). In addition, we collated 223 records on the standing wood volume of restored native forests with known age from 10 studies in six countries (Fig. S2; Table S4).We assessed the rigor of matching for each data pair and weighed it accordingly in subsequent analyses (18).

        <p>We first asked how well tree plantations performed in environmental outcomes relative to reference native forests not resulting from restoration, namely old-growth forests and 'generic' native forests (i.e. other non-restored native forests not reported as old-growth). Not having undergone deforestation, these native forests represent reference environmental conditions (20) toward which forest restoration can aspire (Fig. 2A; (18)). Consistent with prevailing understanding (14,21), tree plantations supported on average 30.4% lower species-specific abundance than did reference native forests (95% confidence interval ('CI' hereafter): 17.4-41.4%; Fig. 2B, upper panel; Table S5; for differences among species groups, see Fig. S3). This biodiversity contrast was echoed across the other three environmental metrics, with tree plantations delivering 32.8% lower aboveground biomass (95% CI: 16.5-45.9%), 60.9% lower soil erosion control (17.5-81.5%), and 13.4% lower water yield (4.3-21.7%; Fig. 2B, upper panel; Table S5). These patterns were mainly driven by the poor performance of monoculture plantations, which exhibited the greatest contrasts with reference native forests (Fig. 2B, upper panel; Table S5). Prolonged age (≥40 years) or abandonment appeared to somewhat improve the environmental performance of plantations (18), with water yield shortfall no longer significant (mean: 6.3%; 95% CI: -28.9-31.9%; Fig. 2B, lower panel; Table S5). However, differences for the other metrics persisted, albeit less marked: 15.4% (3.6-25.8%) for species-specific abundance, and 24.0% (6.2-38.5%) for aboveground biomass; there were too few data to assess soil erosion control (Fig. 2B, lower panel; Fig. S3; Table S5).We first asked how well tree plantations performed in environmental outcomes relative to reference native forests not resulting from restoration, namely old-growth forests and 'generic' native forests (i.e. other non-restored native forests not reported as old-growth).

        <p>We next asked how well tree plantations performed relative to restored native forests of similar age (i.e. with ≤10 years of age difference), represented by secondary forests resulting from natural regeneration, as well as actively restored native forests resulting from the planting of a diverse native tree mix (typically ≥50 species; Figs. 1A andS4, and 2A lower panel; (18)). On environmental performance, tree plantations performed significantly more poorly than restored native forests of similar age in species-specific abundance (32.6% poorer; 95% CI: 15.8-46.0%; there were insufficient data to contrast between species groups; Fig. S3) and marginally so for soil erosion control (80.2% poorer; -57.9-97.5%), but not aboveground biomass (4.1% greater; -23.1-40.9% and spanning zero; Fig. 2C, upper panel; Table S5; data paucity precluded analysis for water yield). The similarity in aboveground biomass appeared to be due to the strong performance of abandoned plantations that seemed to outperform both monocultures and mixed plantations (Fig. 2C, upper panel; although data paucity precluded formal analysis on this).We next asked how well tree plantations performed relative to restored native forests of similar age (i.e. with ≤10 years of age difference), represented by secondary forests resulting from natural regeneration, as well as actively restored native forests resulting from the planting of a diverse native tree mix (typically ≥50 species; Figs. 1A andS4, and 2A lower panel; (18)).

        <p>For wood production, the limited paired data showed that tree plantations had a clear advantage over restored native forests, with 222.7% (105.8%-406.0%) higher wood volumes at comparable age (Fig. 2C, lower panel; Table S5; data paucity precluded analysis of profits from wood production). This advantage was apparent for both intensively managed and abandoned plantations, and regardless of whether wood volumes included all woody species or only merchantable species (Fig. S5). The same conclusion was reached using supplementary nonpaired data on annualized wood yields of restored native forests and various prominent monocultures: average annual volume increments for restored native forests were 61.3% (Welch two-sample t-test: t28.8 = -6.40, P &lt;0.0001) and 86.9% (t26.4 = -9.76, P &lt;0.0001) lower than the lower and upper bounds of the monocultures, respectively (Fig. 2D). For all the above meta-analyses, we found high levels of heterogeneity (18), with I 2 -the metric for heterogeneity -generally ≥80% (Table S5). Findings were robust to publication bias (Supplementary Text; Fig. S6) and various sensitivity analyses related to weighting schemes and model structure ((18); Table S5). They also showed that across the environmental metrics examined, tree plantations performed particularly poorly for soil erosion control (Fig. 2, righthand panels). Because data for different metrics were obtained for different regions (Fig. 2, lefthand panels), the difference among environmental outcomes might reflect inherent biophysical differences among ecosystems. To address this potential geographical confounding effect, we next focused on a subset of our database in which data for different metrics could be geographically matched to a given ecosystem type whose biophysical conditions were largely coherent. Overlaying our data onto the Holdridge Life Zones map (22,23), we identified 'data bundles' for each forest biome where RRs were available for ≥2 metrics. In total, we identified 11 such data bundles for the comparison between tree plantations and reference native forests (Fig. 3A), and seven for the comparison between tree plantations and restored native forests of similar age (Fig. 3B). The patterns of how RRs for soil erosion control compared with other environmental metrics within each data bundle corroborated our earlier findings: relative to reference native forests, plantation shortfalls were almost always greatest for soil erosion control and the least for water yield (Fig. 3).For wood production, the limited paired data showed that tree plantations had a clear advantage over restored native forests, with 222.7% (105.8%-406.0%) higher wood volumes at comparable age (Fig. 2C, lower panel; Table S5; data paucity precluded analysis of profits from wood production).

        <p>We also asked what factors might underlie the variation in environmental performance of tree plantations relative to native forests. For the comparisons of plantations versus reference native forests and plantations versus restored native forests of similar age, respectively, we assessed the relationship between RRs and a set of variables representing plantation features and site biophysical conditions ((18); analyses of wood production were dropped because of data paucity). We considered plantation type, plantation age (except for the comparison involving restored native forests of similar age), and mean annual temperature (in °C; 'MAT' hereafter; (18)). The rationale for considering MAT was that by supporting higher plant diversity (24), warmer climates may show greater contrasts between plantations versus native forests in vegetation complexity, and in turn, in delivery of carbon, soil, and water ecosystem services (25). We also considered mean annual precipitation (in mm y -1 ; 'MAP' hereafter) for soil erosion due to its likely influence on protective ground cover, as well as MAP and the seasonality of native forests (evergreen or deciduous) for water yield due to their likely influence on the hydrological behaviors of forest ecosystems (18,26,27).We also asked what factors might underlie the variation in environmental performance of tree plantations relative to native forests.

        <p>The most parsimonious models selected via small-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) scores ((18); Table S6) showed that increasing plantation age improved plantations' performance relative to that of reference native forests in species-specific abundance and aboveground biomass (Table S7), although such improvement was limited (Figs. 4A): particularly for aboveground biomass, even old (≥40 years) plantations performed less well than reference native forests. Combined with the environmental shortfalls of old or abandoned plantations (Fig. 2B, lower panel), this finding suggests that old plantations no longer intended for productive use (e.g. ( 28)) would deliver environmental benefits more effectively if they were restored to native forests or native forest-like conditions. That such areas are common in our database (Figs. 1A and2A) indicates the sizeable environmental gains that such 'forgotten lands' offer, underscoring the need to assess their global distribution and restoration potential (29).The most parsimonious models selected via small-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) scores ((18); Table S6) showed that increasing plantation age improved plantations' performance relative to that of reference native forests in species-specific abundance and aboveground biomass (Table S7), although such improvement was limited (Figs. 4A): particularly for aboveground biomass, even old (≥40 years) plantations performed less well than reference native forests.

        <p>We also found that increasing MAP (range covered by our data: 490-4210 mm y -1 ) predicted more positive RRs for water yield when comparing tree plantations against reference native forests (Fig. 4B; Table S7), indicating greater plantation shortfalls in water provisioning in drier climates. Clearly, water-oriented forest restoration initiatives should re-examine the practise of establishing large areas of tree plantations in the world's drier regions (30). We did not find evidence of other variables explaining variation in RR values, or for any variable explaining plantation performance relative to restored native forests of similar age (Fig. S7; Table S6). These findings were again robust to various sensitivity analyses related to weighting schemes and model structure ((18); Table S7).We also found that increasing MAP (range covered by our data: 490-4210 mm y -1 ) predicted more positive RRs for water yield when comparing tree plantations against reference native forests (Fig. 4B; Table S7), indicating greater plantation shortfalls in water provisioning in drier climates.

        <p>Our findings have important implications for forest restoration as it is scaled-up globally (7), providing a knowledge base for exploring how outcomes can be best delivered by alternative restoration approaches. We found that restoring native forests typically delivers greater -and certainly no less -environmental benefits than establishing tree plantations, in terms of biodiversity conservation and the key ecosystem services of aboveground carbon storage, soil erosion control, and water provisioning. However, delivering these outcomes will typically result in a trade-off with wood production because of the yield advantage of plantations over restored native forests (31)(32)(33), as measured in wood volumes (distinct from aboveground carbon storage, which in addition to wood volumes also factors in wood densities). These findings provide evidence that if the goal of forest restoration is to recover environmental services on the land being restored, and if wood production is not a primary concern, native forest restoration should be prioritized, using site-appropriate measures including unassisted and assisted natural regeneration and active planting of diverse native species (34)(35)(36). Beyond biodiversity, the stakes are especially high for soil erosion control -given its far poorer delivery by tree plantations relative to native forests. Our synthesis refutes the implicit assumptions of ecosystem service-oriented forest restoration initiatives such as China's Grainfor-Green Program covering &gt;34 million hectares (37,38), and a large collection of projects targeting carbon storage (39), soil conservation (40), and water provisioning (41) that have focused mostly on establishing (monoculture) tree plantations.Our findings have important implications for forest restoration as it is scaled-up globally (7), providing a knowledge base for exploring how outcomes can be best delivered by alternative restoration approaches.

        <p>However, where the goals of forest restoration include wood production, decision-making must navigate the trade-off between environmental and production outcomes (42). Beyond weighing competing goals and adopting restoration approaches accordingly (43), larger-scale land-use planning must be invoked to also consider the 'leakage' of forgone production to land parcels elsewhere: such leakage could alter -and even reverse -the overall environmental gains of forest restoration (44). Ensuring environmental gains while meeting production goals under forest restoration hinges on understanding their trade-offs for a range of restored forest covers, making the acquisition of such information an urgent research priority.However, where the goals of forest restoration include wood production, decision-making must navigate the trade-off between environmental and production outcomes (42).

        <p>Interpretation of our results and associated policy recommendations raises three additional issues. First, while the environmental metrics assessed were our best choices given data availability (18), they each characterize one aspect of a focal outcome. For example, beyond aboveground biomass, an assessment of forest carbon storage must also consider carbon stored belowground (45) as well as in long-lived wood products. Second, because our data came from established tree covers, they represent achievable outcomes of successful forest restoration (13). In reality, restoration approaches and outcomes are often constrained by factors including funding limitations, recurrent disturbances, livelihood needs, and regeneration stochasticity, etc (46,47). Third, while we used paired data and accounted for the rigor of site matching in our analyses (18), we cannot rule out the potential influence of pre-existing site differences incurred by land-use history (13) and species turnover across space (beta-diversity; (48)), both of which are often difficult to ascertain.Interpretation of our results and associated policy recommendations raises three additional issues.

        <p>By presenting a global comparison between tree plantations and native forests that simultaneously assesses their impacts on biodiversity, climate, soil, water, and wood production based on rigorously paired data, our study provides insights into the alignment among these environmental goals and the trade-offs between environmental and production goals under forest restoration. Previous research on the co-benefits of forest restoration has focused on 'where to restore' (29,49). By addressing 'how to restore', our study will help to improve the realism of future spatial prioritization efforts. Finally, other forest restoration outcomes, such as food and nutrition security, will be important in some contexts (50). Future research should address how these outcomes fare under different restoration approaches, and their co-benefit opportunities and unavoidable trade-offs with other environmental and production goals.By presenting a global comparison between tree plantations and native forests that simultaneously assesses their impacts on biodiversity, climate, soil, water, and wood production based on rigorously paired data, our study provides insights into the alignment among these environmental goals and the trade-offs between environmental and production goals under forest restoration.

        <p>Following the terminology used by FAO and the Bonn Challenge, we used broad definitions for forest cover and forest restoration, with the former referring to a wide spectrum of tree cover types from compositionally simple tree plantations to native forests (51), and the latter referring to the action of re-establishing tree cover for a wide range of purposes on degraded or deforested land that would have been naturally forested in recent history (52). We limited our study to the comparison of compositionally simple tree plantations ('tree plantations' hereafter) versus native forests (Fig. 1A; see below for definitions and requirements), given their dominance in discussions about the approaches to and outcomes of forest restoration. Our study therefore did not cover the agroforestry form of forest restoration. For tree plantations, we included those intended for wood but not food production (e.g. fruits and oil palm), because the environmental and production functions addressed in our study did not apply to the latter category. We also did not include rubber plantations because of its high water use, which may penalize its water provisioning performance (53,54).Following the terminology used by FAO and the Bonn Challenge, we used broad definitions for forest cover and forest restoration, with the former referring to a wide spectrum of tree cover types from compositionally simple tree plantations to native forests (51), and the latter referring to the action of re-establishing tree cover for a wide range of purposes on degraded or deforested land that would have been naturally forested in recent history (52).

        <p>For both tree plantations and native forests, we required them to have reasonably extensive cover such that the environmental and production functions assessed reflected their performance rather than that of the wider landscape (see 'Data inclusion criteria' below). Tree plantations resulted from the active planting of a small number of tree species (≤5 species) on formerly deforested land, regardless of whether the trees were native or exotic (e.g. (55,56)). For inclusion into our databases, they had to have been labelled by primary studies explicitly as 'plantations', and they had to have a tree canopy; we therefore required that they were ≥4 years old and stated or implied by the primary studies to have a tree canopy. We included and differentiated among three types of tree plantations: 'monoculture' for when the plantations involved a single species, 'mixed-culture' for 2-5 species, and 'abandoned' for when the primary studies noted or implied that the maintenance of a plantation had been suspended and the plantation allowed to naturally develop for ≥5 years. This last criterion meant that we tended toward being strict with classifying a plantation as abandoned, and that some monoculture or mixed-culture plantations that were in fact abandoned were not labelled as such because their primary studies did not indicate so.For both tree plantations and native forests, we required them to have reasonably extensive cover such that the environmental and production functions assessed reflected their performance rather than that of the wider landscape (see 'Data inclusion criteria' below).

        <p>The native forests considered in our study included four types that fell into two categories: reference native forests and restored native forests. For reference native forests, 'oldgrowth forests' were native forests that had not been degraded or otherwise disturbed by humans; only when the primary studies explicitly labelled a forest as 'primary', 'old-growth', 'pristine', or otherwise undisturbed by humans and when we had no reason to doubt such labelling did we consider it as old-growth forest. 'Generic native forests' were native forests that were neither old-growth nor resulting from restoration starting from a deforested state. They typically had an unclear history of anthropogenic disturbance or condition, or were noted by the primary studies to have been anthropogenically disturbed (e.g. by logging or grazing) or naturally regenerating (although the disturbance from which the forests were regenerating was not clear). Therefore, the reference environmental conditions that generic native forests provided in our study were likely to be poorer than what truly undisturbed reference systems should be, rendering any contrasts between tree plantations and reference native forests quantified by our study more conservative.The native forests considered in our study included four types that fell into two categories: reference native forests and restored native forests.

        <p>For restored native forests, in keeping with the criteria used for tree plantations, we considered only those that started from complete deforestation. Specifically, 'secondary forests' resulted from natural regeneration on formerly deforested land, and 'actively restored native forests' from the active planting of a diverse (required to be ≥6, but in reality, most studies included had much higher numbers) native species mix on formerly deforested land with the goal of restoring native forests. As with tree plantations, we required these two types of restored native forests to be ≥6 years old and stated or implied by primary studies to have a tree canopy; the higher age threshold than that used for tree plantations was considering the potentially slower development of restored native forests. We did not consider the managed mixed forest system as used in Scandinavia (the dominant boreal forest ecosystem in Europe) because of its mixed use of planting a small number of trees and natural regeneration. Given that these mixed forests represent a dominant form of forest management regime within the boreal zone, our database thus contained little data from the boreal ecosystem.For restored native forests, in keeping with the criteria used for tree plantations, we considered only those that started from complete deforestation.

        <p>We used one metric for each of the four environmental outcomes to ensure comparability across primary studies and the interpretability of findings. In addition to meaningfully representing the corresponding outcome, metrics must have good empirical data availability. For biodiversity, we used the metric of species-specific abundance, i.e. the number of individuals for a given species, collected by the same sampling method and adjusted for equal sampling effort between the tree covers being compared (because of varied sampling designs and methods, data compiled from primary studies did not allow accounting for imperfect detection). We chose this metric over species richness, the most obvious alternative metric that has been used in other syntheses (21,57), because the former provides much fuller information on the profile of ecological communities. Whereas species richness reduces the profile of ecological communities to the presence/absence of each species, species-specific abundance reflects the population size of each species, which is a more sensitive and ecologically meaningful representation of species' responses to habitat change. Moreover, the RR we derived from species-specific abundance data, expressed in Equation 1 below, was conceptually linked to the geometric mean of species abundance (58) -a widely adopted metric in assessing biodiversity change (59,60). A notable advantage of this metric is its sensitivity to abundance changes of rare species, which is a desirable property in the context of our study; this is in contrast to the species richness metric, which does not distinguish between rare and abundant species (58,60). Finally, a synthesis of biodiversity contrasts between tree plantations and native forests based on this metric would also make a much-needed contribution to existing syntheses, which have predominantly relied on species richness. Nonetheless, species-specific abundance has the disadvantage of not accommodating zeros; we addressed this issue by adding a small quantity to zero values following previous (see 'Data analysis' below).We used one metric for each of the four environmental outcomes to ensure comparability across primary studies and the interpretability of findings.

        <p>(Equation 1) (Here, mp and mf represent the metric values (i.e. species-specific abundance in the case of biodiversity) for tree plantations and native forests, respectively.) Aboveground biomass is the most widely studied component of carbon storage for forest ecosystems (61), especially given the paucity of data on full ecosystem carbon storage (45). The amount of eroded soil is obviously the most direct, non-proxy-based (e.g. litter standing crop (62) or soil erodibility ( 63)) measure of the lack of soil conservation benefit. For water provisioning, we used water yield, i.e. the amount of water draining annually from forested catchments (as streamflow) or plots, expressed as % of rainfall, as a direct measure of the ability of forest ecosystems to provide water. A small number of studies also separated streamflow into baseflow (i.e. the part of streamflow sustained between rainfall events and fed to streamflow by delayed pathways (64)) and stormflow (i.e. the extra streamflow generated during and shortly after rainfall events (65)). While the former is unambiguously useful to humans, the latter is often sediment-laden and presents a flood risk, constituting mostly a disbenefit. For these studies, we therefore used the separated baseflow and stormflow (with RR signs of the latter reversed to represent the flood control benefit) data as better representations of the water yield benefit.

        <p>We used both wood yield and wood profit for the production function because we foresaw paired data to be limited based on our preliminary searches, and because the two metrics provide complementary information on a forest's production function.

        <p>Data used to calculate RR had to be empirically measured and reported by primary studies as matched data pairs. The rigor of matching concerned all biophysical (e.g. elevation, slope, landscape context, land-use history) and study conditions (notably sampling methods) that may affect the metric performance of the tree covers in question. Based on information reported in the primary studies, we discarded data pairs that were obviously incomparable for the metric concerned (i.e. major differences in biophysical or study conditions). For each retained data pair, we assigned a 'match rigor score' on a 1-3 scale based on the extent to which the primary study made explicit efforts to ensure the matching of biophysical and methodological conditions between data pairs: 1 for 'highly matched', if the above efforts concerned most, if not all, biophysical and methodological conditions; 2 for 'likely matched', if the above efforts concerned at least some biophysical and methodological conditions; and 3 for 'matching extent unclear' if little information was provided on the efforts to ensure the matching, despite data being presented by the primary study as matched.

        <p>We applied additional sets of criteria on paired data depending on the metric. For speciesspecific abundance, in addition to the requirement-by-definition that data must be on the resolution of species or morpho-species (rather than on coarser resolutions such as genera), paired data must meet four additional criteria. First, the ecological communities studied in each primary study must not be defined by functional traits that may influence species' abundance response to habitat change (e.g. cavity-nesting birds, whose requirement for cavities may predispose the species susceptible to forest degradation; we considered 'small mammals'i.e. mice, rats, shrews -a special case where the small body size did not necessarily mean higher or lower sensitivity to habitat change). Second, the ecological communities studied in each primary study must cover ≥6 species, and ≥10% of the species must have been recorded as present. Third, sampling efforts for the tree covers being compared must be equivalent or known, such that species raw counts could be adjusted for equal sampling effort, or the quality and comparability of density estimates could be confirmed (Supplementary Text). Finally, the size of the tree cover expanses sampled must be large enough for the study taxa such that the species-specific abundance data reflected the habitat value of the tree covers, rather than the influence of the wider landscape (66). We used the following criteria to decide whether a tree cover expanse was 'large enough' for the study taxa: ≥1 ha regardless of taxa, or ≥5 ha for more mobile taxa including birds or mammals (other than small mammals, i.e., mice, rats, shrews). Provided that the above criteria were met, we allowed primary studies to be on any taxa, and to report speciesspecific abundance in a range of data formats: raw counts, estimated density, or abundance indices (indices based on occurrence frequencies were not admitted because they are fundamentally about presence/absence rather than abundance).We applied additional sets of criteria on paired data depending on the metric.

In addition, tree cover expanses from which data were obtained must be ≥20 m × 20 m in size. Provided that these requirements were met, we allowed primary studies to address a range of aboveground vegetation components (e.g. woody vegetation only or all vegetation), impose different size thresholds for vegetation measured (e.g. 10 cm or 1 cm in diameter-at-breast-height), use different methods to calculate biomass (e.g. direct harvesting or measurement-based calculation using allometric equations), and express biomass values in different units (e.g. kg biomass m -2 or ton carbon ha -1 ).Paired data on aboveground biomass must be reported in the form of aboveground biomass or carbon per unit area directly by the primary studies, and they must cover at least the tree component of the plant community.

        <p>Paired data on the amount of eroded soil must have been measured on small scales to avoid geological effects on sediment production (e.g. bank erosion along perennial stream channels, or mass wasting); the scales we considered included those of a plot, hill slope, or zeroorder catchment with ephemeral surface runoff only during and/or shortly after rainfall. Data also must not have been obtained by erosion pin-(e.g. ( 67)) or isotope-based (e.g. ( 68)) methods, because data from the former may be confounded by re-deposition of material eroded further upslope, while the validity of the latter method relies on the assumption that the tree covers being compared had equivalent land-use histories, which we could rarely verify from the primary studies. Accepted primary studies that measured soil mass lost per unit area over a certain time span involved a range of plot sizes (e.g. several m 2 to several ha) and temporal scales of measurement (e.g. a full rainy season to multiple years), with erosion values expressed in a range of units (e.g. kg m -2 y -1 or ton ha -1 y -1 ).Paired data on the amount of eroded soil must have been measured on small scales to avoid geological effects on sediment production (e.g. bank erosion along perennial stream channels, or mass wasting); the scales we considered included those of a plot, hill slope, or zeroorder catchment with ephemeral surface runoff only during and/or shortly after rainfall.

        <p>For paired data on water yield, while additional requirements varied depending on the rigor of the matching between tree covers (see later in this paragraph), we required catchments to have perennial streamflow and observations spanning at least one full seasonal cycle. For plotscale studies, we required them to have measured the total amount of water leaving the experimental plots as surface runoff and drainage for at least one full seasonal cycle. We admitted a small number of studies that provided paired data based on longitudinal comparisons between different periods for the same site, provided that those periods had similar rainfall totals (usually &lt;10% difference) to minimize possible confounding effects of differences in climatic conditions. Unlike with the other metrics, multiple primary studies were often needed to derive the water yield RR for a given pair of tree plantation and native forest. In tallying the number of and gauging the rigor of matching for primary studies, we therefore approached studies as 'sets' that contributed data for a given study system.For paired data on water yield, while additional requirements varied depending on the rigor of the matching between tree covers (see later in this paragraph), we required catchments to have perennial streamflow and observations spanning at least one full seasonal cycle.

        <p>For sets of primary studies on water yield that were assigned a match rigor score of 3, we allowed rainfall conditions to deviate from the prevailing conditions during the original calibration period; we also allowed sites to have different geology and hence possibly different deep-leakage losses (69,70) for catchment studies, or drainage to have been estimated using chloride or sodium mass balances for plot-scale studies (71,72). For sets of primary studies assigned a match rigor score of 2, rainfall for the tree covers being compared must be similar and geological conditions identical and not susceptible to deep leakage. Finally and most strictly, for studies assigned a match rigor score of 1, they must either: (i) have used the paired-catchment design to eliminate confounding effects resulting from possible differences in rainfall and/or geologically-controlled deep-leakage losses between catchments or time periods (73), or (ii) catchment leakage losses must be known from a full water budget analysis (74), or (iii) at the plot scale, the main water budget components (including vegetation water use) must be measured separately, or modelled drainage validated against measured soil water dynamics (75,76). Methods employed at paired sites were normally the same, but occasionally we paired a catchment to a plot-scale study and assigned a match rigor score of 2-3 depending on the comprehensiveness of the plot-scale measurements (75,76). Finally, for the small subset of primary studies that separated streamflow into baseflow and stormflow, we required the studies to have used either the straight-line or recursive filter flow separation methods (65,77).For sets of primary studies on water yield that were assigned a match rigor score of 3, we allowed rainfall conditions to deviate from the prevailing conditions during the original calibration period; we also allowed sites to have different geology and hence possibly different deep-leakage losses (69,70) for catchment studies, or drainage to have been estimated using chloride or sodium mass balances for plot-scale studies (71,72).

        <p>For paired data on wood yield or profit, we required primary studies to report empirically measured data on the volume, income, or profit (income minus cost) of wood from equal-aged (age difference ≤5 years) pairs of tree plantations and restored native forests, regardless of whether the measurements were from standing woody vegetation or actual harvest. Given the paucity of data, we did not impose further requirements on the age of tree covers, nor did we require the woody vegetation to be of merchantable species only. Barring the paired-data requirement, we applied the same criteria above to non-paired data on the wood yield of restored native forests, but we additionally required that the age of the forests must have been reported.For paired data on wood yield or profit, we required primary studies to report empirically measured data on the volume, income, or profit (income minus cost) of wood from equal-aged (age difference ≤5 years) pairs of tree plantations and restored native forests, regardless of whether the measurements were from standing woody vegetation or actual harvest.

        <p>For species-specific abundance, we conducted two complementary primary searches on Web of Science on October 4 th 2020 to identify relevant primary studies (Table S1), the collection of which we further supplemented by (i) screening a series of published 'tier-1' reviews, meta-analyses, or databases, (ii) gleaning from these 'tier-1' syntheses relevant primary studies and 'tier-2' syntheses, (iii) gleaning from these 'tier-2' syntheses additional primary studies.

        <p>For water yield, we systematically consulted: (i) reviews of the early (mostly pre-1990) literature as well as more recent reviews and meta-analyses on forest and hydrology (both general and on specific regions, countries or tree species; Table S2 S3) with whom we inquired about possible additional data. The above efforts supplemented and considerably added to a primary search we had conducted earlier on Web of Science on June 1 st , 2018 that targeted relevant primary studies on water yield, as well as an earlier screening of a series of published reviews/metaanalyses/databases (Table S2) that we had located via a separate Web of Science search (Table S1) on November 17 th , 2017 and via snowballing. Given this highly extensive effort, and the fact that our water yield database includes far more records than those of existing meta-analyses (e.g. ( 91)), we are confident that our search has located the vast majority of existing hydrological datasets and publications that compare plantations versus native forests.For water yield, we systematically consulted: (i) reviews of the early (mostly pre-1990) literature as well as more recent reviews and meta-analyses on forest and hydrology (both general and on specific regions, countries or tree species; Table S2 S3) with whom we inquired about possible additional data.

        <p>Finally, for wood yield and wood profit, we conducted a series of primary searches on Web of Science on October 1 st 2021 to identify relevant primary studies (Table S1), the collection of which we further supplemented by screening all studies that cited the seminal study published in 1992 by Lugo (33) on comparing the wood production function of tree plantations and secondary forests, as of October 1 st 2021 on

        <p>For all metrics, we screened abstract hits in any language that they came in, but for water yield in particular, we systematically covered the following languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish. We extracted metric values and meta-data (Supplementary Text) directly from primary studies wherever possible, following the data resolution (i.e. whether each set of paired data corresponded to a replicate sampling unit, or the mean or sum of multiple sampling units) reported in the primary studies. Where primary studies did not report study site mean annual temperature (i.e. MAT), we extracted it from the WorldClim database (92) based on site coordinates. Where necessary, we used DataThief III (93) to extract data presented in figures for aboveground biomass, soil erosion control, wood yield, and wood profit; for water yield, we approached authors for original data (these studies are marked with an asterisk in Table S4). We double-checked all extracted data to minimize transcriptional error.For all metrics, we screened abstract hits in any language that they came in, but for water yield in particular, we systematically covered the following languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, and Spanish.

        <p>For species-specific abundance data in formats other than density (e.g. individuals ha -1 ), we adjusted their values by sampling effort to ensure that data for tree plantations and native forests corresponded to equal sampling effort. For example, if a plantation was sampled with 1.5 times the amount of effort as the native forest against which it was compared, for each species, the abundance or relative abundance associated with the plantation would be divided by 1.5 before comparison with the abundance or relative abundance associated with the native forest.For species-specific abundance data in formats other than density (e.g. individuals ha -1 ), we adjusted their values by sampling effort to ensure that data for tree plantations and native forests corresponded to equal sampling effort.

        <p>We measured sampling effort by the unit used in the primary studies.

        <p>For species-specific abundance, aboveground biomass, soil erosion control, wood yield, and wood profit, we scored the sampling effort for each RR to incorporate into analyses (see 'Data analysis' below), considering it an important determinant of data quality. For water yield, we used the rigor of matching to represent data quality. We scored the sampling effort for each RR as follows. For species-specific abundance, we tallied the number of the finest sampling-unit hierarchy that could be considered independent, based on their spacing in comparison with our knowledge of the presumed accepted study design for the study taxa (Supplementary Text). For aboveground biomass, because primary studies rarely reported the spatial distance between sampling units, making it impossible to gauge the number of independent sampling units, we calculated the total area sampled (i.e. plot areas summed between the tree-cover pair, in m 2 ) as a surrogate for sampling effort. For soil erosion studies, we used the duration of the observations (in months) as a surrogate for sampling effort. For wood yield and wood profit, we also used the total area sampled (i.e. plot areas summed between the tree-cover pair, in m 2 ) as a measure of sampling effort.For species-specific abundance, aboveground biomass, soil erosion control, wood yield, and wood profit, we scored the sampling effort for each RR to incorporate into analyses (see 'Data analysis' below), considering it an important determinant of data quality.

        <p>For species-specific abundance, we additionally assigned a 'habitat certainty score' to each RR to represent the extent to which it reflected the influence of tree covers per se as habitat for the species, rather than the influence of the wider landscape, and we incorporated this score into subsequent analyses (see 'Data analysis' below): 1 for 'certain or almost certain reflection of habitat influence', and 2 for 'unclear or uncertain reflection of habitat influence' (Supplementary Text).For species-specific abundance, we additionally assigned a 'habitat certainty score' to each RR to represent the extent to which it reflected the influence of tree covers per se as habitat for the species, rather than the influence of the wider landscape, and we incorporated this score into subsequent analyses (see 'Data analysis' below): 1 for 'certain or almost certain reflection of habitat influence', and 2 for 'unclear or uncertain reflection of habitat influence' (Supplementary Text).</p>
        <p>We conducted multi-level meta-analyses and meta-regressions of RR (94) using the 'lme()' function, which implements a linear mixed-effects model, in package '

For meta-analyses assessing the performance of tree plantations relative to native forests, we used an intercept-only fixed effect, and we fitted a group of random intercept variables specific to each metric to account for (and model) potential shared variation and data non-independence. For data on aboveground biomass, soil erosion, and water yield, we used the following random intercept variables in descending order of nestedness (i.e. later variables were nested within earlier variables and they are referred to as 'of lower tier'):

For wood production, because of data paucity, we only retained the identity of primary studies as a random intercept variable. Finally, for all metrics, we added one more, lowest-tier random intercept variable to the above lists to enable the estimation of I 2 , the measure of the heterogeneity of meta-analytic data or, in other words, variation not due to sampling variance arising from differences in sampling efforts among effect sizes (97). We note that I 2 ranges from 0 to 100%; an earlier meta-analysis (98) found that in ecological studies, I 2 is often over 90% (see below on how we calculated I 2 and associated statistics from our models).(iv) Level 4: the site identity of the native forest; (v) Level 5: the identity of the ecological community to which each RR belonged.

        <p>For meta-regressions assessing the factors that may affect the performance of tree plantations relative to native forests, we adopted the same random effect structures as used in meta-analyses except for species-specific abundance (see below in this paragraph), and we conducted model selection based on global models of fixed effects that we constructed separately for each metric (see below). For species-specific abundance, considering that in addition to the focal variables of interest (see below), species with different habitat preferences would have vastly different RRs -an effect that we were unable to account for because of the large range of species concerned that lack reliable habitat preference information -we first derived the community-level RR by calculating the mean of all RRs within an ecological community. Conceptually, this mean is akin to the geometric mean of species abundance, albeit without being exponentiated (58). We used this community-level RR to represent the biodiversity contrast between tree plantations and native forests in subsequent meta-regressions. Because of this community-level aggregation, for data on species-specific abundance, we removed the identity of the ecological community to which each RR belonged from the random effect structure.For meta-regressions assessing the factors that may affect the performance of tree plantations relative to native forests, we adopted the same random effect structures as used in meta-analyses except for species-specific abundance (see below in this paragraph), and we conducted model selection based on global models of fixed effects that we constructed separately for each metric (see below).

        <p>For the comparison between tree plantations and reference native forests, our global models for each environmental metric are described in Equations 3-7 below. Specifically, our predictor variables included plantation type, plantation age and its quadratic term, mean annual temperature (MAT; in °C) and its interaction with plantation age; we used the quadratic term to accommodate potential nonlinear relationships between RR and plantation age. For species-specific abundance, because AICc-based model selection identified the model containing only plantation type as the best model (Table S6), we in turn assessed, for each plantation type, the factors that may affect its performance relative to reference native forests, using the same global model structure noted above except that we removed the predictor variable of plantation type. For soil erosion control, we additionally included mean annual precipitation (MAP; in mm y -1 ), as well as its interaction with plantation age and with MAT; the latter interaction was considering the possibility that more humid climates may facilitate forest understory growth and in turn, buffer soil erosion. For water yield, we additionally included native forest seasonality (evergreen or deciduous), as well as MAP and its interaction with plantation age. We used MAP instead of the potentially more relevant aridity index (99) because data on the latter were not available from primary studies, while globally available data derived from remote sensing and modelling (100) may be too coarse to reflect site-level conditions.For the comparison between tree plantations and reference native forests, our global models for each environmental metric are described in Equations 3-7 below.

        <p>We checked for collinearity among predictor variables before running all global models. Collinearity was not an issue (|rPearson| &lt; 0.7) for species-specific abundance or aboveground biomass, but there was a correlation between plantation age and MAT for soil erosion control, and native forest seasonality was correlated with MAP and MAT for water yield. We therefore constructed two versions of global model for soil erosion control, one retaining plantation age (Equation 4) and the other MAT (Equation 5). Similarly, we constructed two versions of global model for water yield, one retaining MAT and MAP (Equation 6) and the other native forest seasonality (Equation 7). For the comparison between tree plantations and restored native forests of similar age, our global models for species-specific abundance and aboveground biomass followed Equation 3 above except that they dropped plantation age and its quadratic term, and they were run after confirming the absence of collinearity (|rPearson| &lt; 0.7) among predictor variables. For soil erosion control, due to the small size of the dataset (n=14), we dropped MAP from the global model (given that (|rPearson| =0.65 between MAT and MAP, much of the variation associated with MAP should have been represented by MAT). In all, the above procedures led to the same global model structure for species-specific abundance, aboveground biomass, and soil erosion control, expressed in Equation 8 below; we did not conduct meta-regressions on water yield because of insufficient data.We checked for collinearity among predictor variables before running all global models. Collinearity was not an issue (|rPearson| &lt; 0.7) for species-specific abundance or aboveground biomass, but there was a correlation between plantation age and MAT for soil erosion control, and native forest seasonality was correlated with MAP and MAT for water yield. We therefore constructed two versions of global model for soil erosion control, one retaining plantation age (Equation 4) and the other MAT (Equation 5). Similarly, we constructed two versions of global model for water yield, one retaining MAT and MAP (Equation 6) and the other native forest seasonality (Equation 7).

        <p>We then used model selection based on the small-sample-corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) from these global models to identify the best model for each metric, i.e. the fixed effect configuration that produced the lowest AICc scores, using package '
            <rs type="software">MuMIn</rs>' (version 
            <rs type="version">1.43.17</rs>; (101)) in the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> programming language. We in turn re-ran these best models to make inferences about the effects of the variables retained based on model estimates of mean and standard error, according to t distributions with adjusted degrees of freedom from the lme() models.
        </p>
        <p>In all meta-analyses and meta-regressions above, we applied a weighting scheme that reflected the data quality of RR that may result from: (i) data comparability between tree plantations and matched native forests (gauged by the match rigor score; see the first paragraph in the section 'Data inclusion criteria' above); (ii) the sampling effort that went into producing the RRs, for all metrics except for water yield; and (iii) for data on species-specific abundance, the degree to which species' abundance counts reflected the influence of tree covers per se as habitat for the species rather than the influence of the wider landscape (gauged by the habitat certainty score; see the last paragraph in the section 'Data compilation' above). We did not follow the conventional weighting scheme based on the sampling variance of RR because this information was available for only a small subset of primary studies, particularly considering the species-specific abundance format of our biodiversity data. Our view was that it would be far more preferable to apply a defensible, albeit alternative, weighting scheme than discarding the majority of available data. We used the following equations to calculate weight for RR for the different metrics: For RR i, wi represented its weight in the linear mixed-effect models (RRs with higher wi would be given more weight in the analyses), ci its match rigor score, and ni the sampling effort (applicable to all metrics except for water yield; see the second paragraph in the section titled 'Additional note on data entry' below). For data on species-specific abundance, hi additionally represented the larger habitat certainty score for the two tree covers being compared (i.e. the habitat certainty score of the tree cover more susceptible to the influence of landscape context). Because of the way the function 'lme()' in package '
            <rs type="software">nlme</rs>' works, we supplied the above wi values in the form of 'weights = ~I(1/wi)' in running the function 'lme()'.
        </p>
        <p>To calculate I 2 , we adopted the following procedures. Due to the above unconventional weighting scheme and the lack of sampling variance information for RR, we assumed that the inverse of weight for each RR was proportional to its sampling variance. We could then extend a traditional weighted regression to use the multilevel meta-analytic framework following the equations below: .

        <p>For all linear mixed-effect models (i.e. multi-level meta-analysis and meta-regression models), we visually assessed residual and QQ plots, which indicated general satisfaction of the assumption of residual normality (Figs. S8-S11). Concerns about any potential violation of this assumption should be alleviated by the fact that mixed-effect models are known to be generally robust to violations of model assumptions (104). We also confirmed findings to be generally free from publication bias (Supplementary Text). For geographical matching of a subset of RRs, we overlaid the geographical locations of all RRs with the Holdridge Life Zones map (22,23), using packages '
            <rs type="software">rgdal</rs>' (version

            <rs type="software">spatialEco</rs>' (version 
            <rs type="version">1.3-5</rs>; (106)) in the R programming language. Finally, we conducted Welch two-sample t-tests to compare the nonpaired wood yield data on restored native forests with the crude yield estimates (low and high bounds) for the world's main monoculture plantations.
        </p>
        <p>For all metrics, we conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses for our meta-analyses and meta-regressions, one concerning the weighting schemes, and the other the random effect structures. The former was in light of the potential subjectivity and varying standards of reporting from primary studies (especially for the habitat certainty score and sampling effort) involved in the calculation of the weighting scores. We first repeated all analyses using a consistent weight score calculated based on Equation 11 for all metrics (i.e. the inverse of the match rigor score, assuming it alone represented the quality of a given RR), and we additionally repeated all analyses without a weight score. For the random effect structure of meta-analyses and meta-regressions, considering that the sharing of a same reference native forest site among multiple RRs did not apply to many primary studies, we additionally repeated all analyses without using the site identity of the native forest as a random intercept variable.For all metrics, we conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses for our meta-analyses and meta-regressions, one concerning the weighting schemes, and the other the random effect structures.

        <p>Widespread forest restoration via tree plantations to meet climate, soil, water, and wood production goals (7,(10)(11)(12) rests on the implicit assumption that tree plantations are as effective as native forests in delivering these goals. Despite numerous global-scale databases and metaanalyses addressing the carbon storage, soil erosion control, and water provisioning functions of forests (including tree plantations; Table S2), direct comparison of tree plantations versus native forests founded on paired empirical data that are needed to rigorously test the above assumption ( 13) is lacking, with the vast majority of existing databases and meta-analyses not involving paired plantation and native forest sites (Table S2). The handful of analyses that do involve paired data tend to have regional or generally poor data coverage (e.g. because the study was not designed to target the comparison of paired plantations and native forests, or because the study was older and thus did not cover the larger amount of more recent data; Table S2). The lack of a global-scale evidence synthesis is particularly acute for soil erosion and water provisioning (Table S2). In sum, the assumption that tree plantations are as effective as native forests in delivering the ecosystem services of carbon storage, soil erosion control, and water provisioning is yet to be rigorously tested through a global-scale synthesis of paired empirical data. Similarly, despite the widely held belief that tree plantations outperform native forests in sustainably producing wood (31,32), rigorous comparisons of their production function relative to restored native forests based on paired data -crucial for understanding the relative merits of the two alternative restoration approaches -have been lacking.Widespread forest restoration via tree plantations to meet climate, soil, water, and wood production goals (7,(10)(11)(12) rests on the implicit assumption that tree plantations are as effective as native forests in delivering these goals.

        <p>Our data compilation covered a wide range of publication types, including peer-reviewed literature, technical reports, conference/symposium proceedings, books, book chapters, and theses/dissertations (Table S4). This wide coverage of publication type should aid in reducing potential publication bias of our database (97). Funnel plots produced using package '
            <rs type="software">metafor</rs>' (version 
            <rs type="version">2.4-0</rs>; (107)) in the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> programming language additionally indicated that publication bias (the small-study effect where studies with small sample sizes can have effect sizes with large magnitudes) was most likely not a problem for our database (Fig. S2): any asymmetry in the funnel plots for individual analyses on species-specific abundance, aboveground biomass, and soil erosion control did not appear to be linked to smaller studies (i.e. those with lower sampling efforts). For water yield studies, we considered lower sampling effort -if present -unlikely to render lower publication rates and therefore publication bias, given the large amount of effort involved in typical water yield studies. This method of using sampling efforts is consistent with the current recommendation for examining the publication bias (the small-study effect) in multilevel meta-analytic models (108).

        <p>For species-specific abundance, metric values entered comprised either estimated density, or the abundance of individual species within the ecological community studied, measured by (i) tallying up raw counts across multiple sampling units for the tree cover in question and (ii) adjusting for sampling effort (see below). Whenever both estimated density and raw counts were available, we used the former, assuming that they had accounted for factors that may affect the comparability of raw counts (e.g. capture/detection probability). For primary studies that reported abundance information for the same ecological community that was obtained using multiple sampling methods, we used only data from the method that we considered most capable of describing the community (e.g. between data on bird communities collected by point counts versus by mist-netting, we used those from the former). Importantly, we retained species that were not detected in either of the tree covers being compared but that were part of the ecological community studied, given that shared absence also informs the contrast between tree covers. This situation arose if the primary study involved additional land cover types than the plantation and native forest we considered here. We excluded non-native species whenever possible, noting however that the vast majority of primary studies did not differentiate between native versus non-native species. Similarly, we were unable to distinguish between forestversus non-forestdwelling species or exclude the latter because the vast majority of primary species did not provide such information. For subsequent analyses, we streamlined the identity of study taxa into the following main groups to facilitate the use of taxonomic group identity as a random intercept variable: macrofungi, epiphyte plants, climber plants, herbs, standing woody plants, understory plants (where it was not possible to classify the study plant species into the previous groups), arthropods, other invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, bats, and terrestrial mammals (totaling 13 taxonomic groups). For water yield, catchment data were averaged over a period of 5-7 years where possible, often using original basic rainfall and streamflow data obtained from the primary study authors themselves or from institutional websites.For species-specific abundance, metric values entered comprised either estimated density, or the abundance of individual species within the ecological community studied, measured by (i) tallying up raw counts across multiple sampling units for the tree cover in question and (ii) adjusting for sampling effort (see below).

        <p>To score sampling effort for species-specific abundance, we delineated and tallied the number of the finest sampling-unit hierarchy that we considered eligible to be considered as independent, based on the spatial distance between sampling units and what we considered as acceptable minimum spacing for the study taxa. Where spatial distance among sampling units was unclear, we defaulted to the coarsest sampling unit hierarchy as independent sampling units. For example, for a primary study on ground beetles, if traps laid within sampling plots were too close to be considered as independent (e.g. 5 m) while the sampling plots were spaced far enough (e.g. 500 m), we would consider the plots, rather than traps, as independent sampling units. We used a 500 m distance as the minimum spacing among independent sampling units for largebodied organisms (mammals other than 'small mammals'i.e. mice, rats, shrews) and flying organisms sampled using active attraction (e.g. moths sampled using light traps), 200 m for small mammals, birds, herpetofauna, and flying insects sampled passively, and 100 m for small-bodied or immobile organisms (e.g. ants, plants).To score sampling effort for species-specific abundance, we delineated and tallied the number of the finest sampling-unit hierarchy that we considered eligible to be considered as independent, based on the spatial distance between sampling units and what we considered as acceptable minimum spacing for the study taxa.

        <p>To assign 'habitat certainty score' to RR on species-specific abundance, we used the following criteria: 1 for certain or almost certain absence of landscape effects (i.e. tree cover expanses were known to be ≥50 ha or otherwise extensive, regardless of study taxa), and 2 for unclear (i.e. the area of tree cover expanses was unknown) or uncertain (i.e. tree cover expanses were known to be &lt;50 ha, regardless of study taxa) absence of landscape effects. In calculating RR for species-specific abundance, for data pairs involving zero abundance values (which would make it impossible to calculate RR), we handled these zero values separately for each community dataset (i.e. for each pair of tree cover). For each community dataset that had zero values, we first identified the smallest non-zero abundance value for any species in the community, and we added half of this value to each zero value following O'Brien and colleagues (109). The need to handle zero values applied to species-specific abundance data only.To assign 'habitat certainty score' to RR on species-specific abundance, we used the following criteria: 1 for certain or almost certain absence of landscape effects (i.e. tree cover expanses were known to be ≥50 ha or otherwise extensive, regardless of study taxa), and 2 for unclear (i.e. the area of tree cover expanses was unknown) or uncertain (i.e. tree cover expanses were known to be &lt;50 ha, regardless of study taxa) absence of landscape effects.

For age information expressed in a range, we took the middle value of the range.

Adrian Bruijnzeel 3,4 *, Paula Meli 5,6 , Phillip A. Martin 2 , Jun Zhang Fig. S4. Overview of the part of database that went into our analyses. Figure contents are equivalent to those in Fig. 1, except that for the comparison between tree plantations and restored native forests, only data for the tree cover pairs of similar age (i.e. with ≤10 years of age difference) are displayed. (A) The amount of paired data compiled into our database for different combinations of plantations and native forests. For species-specific abundance, the amount of data is represented by the number of plantation-native forest pairs that supplied species-level RRs for entire ecological communities; for all other metrics, it is represented by the number of RRs.

        <p>Table S3. List of experts consulted for data on eroded soil and water yield. We consulted these experts for (i) additional data on eroded soil, and (ii) background information, literature references, unpublished theses and reports, and access to original data pertaining to water yield. Note: †: For compilation of data on water yield, frequently multiple studies were needed to derive the RR for a given plantation and native forest pair. In listing primary studies for water yield, we therefore place such groups of primary studies together, in the column 'No.', organizing them in alphabetical order (within groups and among groups). *: For these water yield studies, we relied on original data provided by the primary study authors to derive water yield. ‡: Studies marked with this sign were not included in the analyses because they involved comparisons between tree plantations and restored native forests that differed by &gt;10 years in age.Table S3.

Note: †: This sensitivity analysis did not concern water yield, because Equation 11 was used to calculate weight scores for water yield RR in the main analyses. * This analysis was for the subset of data comparing abandoned plantations versus reference native forests. ‡: No R 2 was calculated because the best model was an intercept-only model.Table S7.
