        <p>Poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetic chemicals, which are introduced to the environment through anthropogenic activities. Aqueous film forming foam used in 9 firefighting, wastewater effluent, landfill leachate, and biosolids are major sources of PFAS input to soil and groundwater. Remediation of PFAS contaminated solid and aqueous media is challenging, which is attributed to the chemical and thermal stability of PFAS and the complexity of PFAS mixtures. In this review, remediation of PFAS contaminated soils through manipulation of their bioavailability and destruction is presented. While the mobilizing amendments (e.g., surfactants) enhance the mobility and bioavailability of PFAS, the immobilizing amendments (e.g., activated carbon) decrease their bioavailability and mobility.Poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetic chemicals, which are introduced to the environment through anthropogenic activities.

        <p>The substances of both organic and inorganic origin containing at least one fluorine (F) atom are generally termed as fluorinated substances or fluorochemicals or fluorinated chemicals.The substances of both organic and inorganic origin containing at least one fluorine (F) atom are generally termed as fluorinated substances or fluorochemicals or fluorinated chemicals.</p>
        <p>Among them, a specific sub-group of chemicals are known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that contain a perfluoroalkyl moiety in their structures (Banks et al., 1994;Buck et al., 2011). The perfluoroalkyl moiety, generally represented by CnF2n+1, is a one or more carbon (C) atom-containing fluorinated aliphatic chain in which most of its hydrogen (H) atoms are substituted by F atoms (Banks et al., 1994). To be classified as a PFAS, the substance should have at least one perfluoroalkyl moiety in its chemical structure.Among them, a specific sub-group of chemicals are known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) that contain a perfluoroalkyl moiety in their structures (Banks et al., 1994;Buck et al., 2011).

        <p>The key groups of PFASs include perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and perfluorinated phosphonic acids (PFPAs), whereas polyfluorinated compounds include fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (FTSs), polyfluorinated alkyl phosphates (PAPs), perfluorooctane sulfonamine (PFOSA), and their derivatives (Buck et al., 2011). It is estimated that &gt;4,000 synthetic fluorinated compounds belong to the complex PFAS family.The key groups of PFASs include perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs), perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and perfluorinated phosphonic acids (PFPAs), whereas polyfluorinated compounds include fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (FTSs), polyfluorinated alkyl phosphates (PAPs), perfluorooctane sulfonamine (PFOSA), and their derivatives (Buck et al., 2011).

        <p>The perfluorinated or polyfluorinated compounds are anthropogenic in nature and released into the environment due to human and industrial activities (Buck et al., 2011). Owing to their strong C-F bond strengths, these compounds are remarkably resistant to external environmental conditions such as temperature, water or oil status of the medium, and microbial attack. As a result, PFASs have found widespread applications in various industries including plastic manufacturing, textiles and leather industries, surfactants preparation, and even in medical applications (Prevedouros et al., 2006). Daily-life applications of PFASs extend to food wrapping materials, drink can-lining materials, non-sticky cookware, water-resistant fabrics and clothing, grease/oil resistant papers and surfaces, and firefighting foam (Darrow et al., 2013;Mahinroosta and Senevirathna, 2020;Yeung et al., 2016).The perfluorinated or polyfluorinated compounds are anthropogenic in nature and released into the environment due to human and industrial activities (Buck et al., 2011).

        <p>Due to their widespread use in industries and daily-life products, PFAS have entered the soil and water environments, and now they are found in microorganisms, plants, higher animals, and humans globally, including in the Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems (Ahrens et al., 2016;Dreyer et al., 2009;Sunderland et al., 2019). Due to their unique chemical structures and stability, several PFASs have been proven to be bioaccumulative and toxic in higher animals including humans (Ahrens et al., 2019;Lau et al., 2007;Xiao et al., 2017). Among various usages, aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) is recognised as one of the key sources of PFAS entry into the soil and water environments. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) are the most commonly found PFASs in AFFF. The Class B fluorine-based AFFF is used to extinguish flammable liquid-caused fires, and firefighting training sites at and around fire brigades, airports, and defence establishments have been reported to contaminate the surrounding soil, water bodies, and groundwater with PFAS (Cousins et al., 2019). In addition to such point sources of PFAS, diffused pollution of soil and groundwater has taken place through transportation of these contaminants from household products and activities via biosolids, wastewater treatment plants, and landfill leachates (Sinclair and Kannan, 2006;Bolan, 2019).Due to their widespread use in industries and daily-life products, PFAS have entered the soil and water environments, and now they are found in microorganisms, plants, higher animals, and humans globally, including in the Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems (Ahrens et al., 2016;Dreyer et al., 2009;Sunderland et al., 2019).

        <p>Because of the high chemical, thermal, and biological stability of PFAS compounds, and also due to their existence as mixtures in environmental matrices, their remediation both in water and soil/sediment is extremely challenging. Approaches taken to remediate PFAS in solid and liquid media can be different. For example, they can be removed from a solid medium (e.g., soil or biosolid) following mobilization using selective chemical species, or their concentration can be reduced by plant uptake and by chemical or microbial destruction (Jeon et al., 2011;Simon et al., 2019). In the case of liquid media, PFAS compounds are removed mostly by using adsorbents or chemical destruction (Merino et al., 2016). PFAS immobilization in solid media has also been reported by adsorbents or fixing agents (Darlington et al., 2018). In terms of biotic degradation of PFAS compounds in soil and water, available information is limited (Wei et al., 2019).Because of the high chemical, thermal, and biological stability of PFAS compounds, and also due to their existence as mixtures in environmental matrices, their remediation both in water and soil/sediment is extremely challenging.

        <p>A few review articles have concentrated on strategies for removing PFAS compounds from water, including sorption on various adsorbents (Du et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2019;Vo et al., 2020), focussing on field testing of selected adsorbents (Espana et al., 2015), and advanced defluorination and degradation (thermal and non-thermal) methods (Ahmed et al., 2020;Vo et al., 2020), but review articles critically analysing soil PFAS remediation are scarce in the literature. Only two reviews have been written on this topic in the recent past (Ross et al., 2018;Mahinroosta and Senevirathna, 2020). However, more information is needed concerning the scientific and technological soundness of PFAS remediation approaches, especially in soils.A few review articles have concentrated on strategies for removing PFAS compounds from water, including sorption on various adsorbents (Du et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2019;Vo et al., 2020), focussing on field testing of selected adsorbents (Espana et al., 2015), and advanced defluorination and degradation (thermal and non-thermal) methods (Ahmed et al., 2020;Vo et al., 2020), but review articles critically analysing soil PFAS remediation are scarce in the literature.

        <p>So, the current review paper aims to present information on the remediation of PFAS contaminated soils by critically reflecting on the pros and cons of contaminant mobilization, immobilization, and destruction strategies using a wide range of soil amendments. The mobilizing amendments help to desorb PFAS compounds that are bound to soil minerals or organic matter, and hence increase their bioavailability and mobility (Milinovic et al., 2015(Milinovic et al., , 2016;;Pan et al., 2009;Tang et al., 2017). In contrast, the immobilizing amendments adsorb or fix the PFAS compounds in soils reducing their bioavailability and mobility (Aly et al., 2019;Das et al., 2013;Hale et al., 2017). This review discusses all the above strategies by first presenting an overview of various soil PFAS sources, PFAS interactions with soil components and bioavailability, soil PFAS remediation through manipulating the bioavailability using conventional and advanced soil amendments along with some exemplary case studies, and highlighting their respective techno-economic advantages and disadvantages.So, the current review paper aims to present information on the remediation of PFAS contaminated soils by critically reflecting on the pros and cons of contaminant mobilization, immobilization, and destruction strategies using a wide range of soil amendments.

        <p>Soil and water environments receive PFAS contaminants mainly through discharge of AFFF, effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and landfills, and contaminated wastes such as biosolids (Table 1; Figure 1).Soil and water environments receive PFAS contaminants mainly through discharge of AFFF, effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and landfills, and contaminated wastes such as biosolids (Table 1; Figure 1).</p>
        <p>As an important point source, PFAS from AFFF can be introduced into the terrestrial and aquatic environments during storage, handling, use, and post-use cleaning stages of these chemicals (Cousins et al., 2019). For example, a small PFAS volume can be released in the form of a concentrated foam at the time of storage, careless handling during transfer of containers, and usage and calibration of equipment. However, a more occasional release than the above occurs when a large volume of PFAS enters into the environment during real firefighting operations (Houtz et al., 2012(Houtz et al., , 2013)). Additionally, downward leakage and/or lateral overflow from temporary ponds storing AFFF-contaminated water following fire training operations can also become an important diffused source of contamination in the surrounding areas (Eschauzier et al., 2013;Houtz et al., 2012;2013).As an important point source, PFAS from AFFF can be introduced into the terrestrial and aquatic environments during storage, handling, use, and post-use cleaning stages of these chemicals (Cousins et al., 2019).

        <p>Soil and groundwater contamination resulting from the use of firefighting foams at defence sites, airports, and fire brigade training sites has been noticed in many countries including Australia and the USA. For example, currently around 90 sites in Australia are being investigated for PFAS contamination from the regular use of firefighting foam (Australian Defense, 2019). Similarly, around 26,000 PFAS contaminated sites exist across the USA, impacting more than six million people through drinking water contamination (Darlington et al., 2018). Both in Australia and USA, the impacted areas are located around and near defence facilities where AFFF is used either for real fire extinguishing or training purposes. There are sources of PFAS other than AFFF that contaminate the environment, but given the great extent of PFAS contamination (i.e., high PFAS concentration and toxic chemical constituents) in and around defence sites globally, these sites warrant immediate risk assessment and remediation actions.Soil and groundwater contamination resulting from the use of firefighting foams at defence sites, airports, and fire brigade training sites has been noticed in many countries including Australia and the USA.

        <p>Municipal waste disposal sites, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and biosolids provide major diffused sources of PFAS contamination of soil and water. For example, household wastewater containing PFAS chemicals in low concentration can reach municipal wastewater treatment plants and finally accumulate in biosolids (Bossi et al., 2008;Campo et al., 2014;Chen et al., 2012a;Gallen et al., 2018;Guo et al., 2010; SI Figure 1). A number of PFAS compounds including PFOA and PFOS were found in Australian biosolids in recent years (Gallen et al., 2016;2017;2018). Higgins et al. (2005) Levels of PFAS contamination in Swedish sludge ranged from 0.6 to 23.9 ng/g and 1.6 to 54.8 ng/g for PFOA and PFOS, respectively (Haglund and Olofsson, 2009). Other estimates suggested that annually around 2749-3450 kg of total PFAS was present in biosolids across the USA, and around 1375-2070 kg PFAS ended up in agricultural land through soil applications (Venkatesan and Halden, 2013). Sepulvado et al. (2011) found that PFASs were found to concentrate to the 120 cm soil depth and reached a concentration up to 483 ng/g in field soils that had received long term biosolid applications. Washington et al. (2010) investigated sludgeapplied soils in proximity to a wastewater treatment plant handling sewage waste from PFAS industries. The PFOS and PFOA concentrations in the sludge applied soil reached a maximum of 408 µg/kg and 312 µg/kg, respectively. Sludge from this wastewater treatment plant was found to contain PFOA concentrations up to 1875 ng/g. PFAS can enter the sewage system through a variety of industrial sources that include PFAS manufacturing, fluoropolymer manufacturing, and AFFF manufacturing (Prevedouros et al., 2006). Many studies reported the degree of PFAS pollution in wastewater sludge (Table 1).Municipal waste disposal sites, landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and biosolids provide major diffused sources of PFAS contamination of soil and water. For example, household wastewater containing PFAS chemicals in low concentration can reach municipal wastewater treatment plants and finally accumulate in biosolids (Bossi et al., 2008;Campo et al., 2014;Chen et al., 2012a;Gallen et al., 2018;Guo et al., 2010; SI Figure 1).

        <p>The increase in concentration of some PFAS compounds such as perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) in sewage effluents over that in the influent is attributed to the degradation of more complex PFAA precursors during activated sludge treatment (Houtz et al., 2012;2013). For example, wastewater treatment plants could show 9-352% increase in PFOA concentration in effluents over influents (Schultz et al., 2006). However, PFOS often could exhibit a decrease in concentration in the effluent, attributed to high Kd values causing retention of PFOS in the sludge and lowering final PFOS concentrations in effluents (Yu et al., 2009). Becker et al.The increase in concentration of some PFAS compounds such as perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) in sewage effluents over that in the influent is attributed to the degradation of more complex PFAA precursors during activated sludge treatment (Houtz et al., 2012;2013).

        <p>Household wastes composed of goods containing hydrophobic and stain-resistant coatings (e.g., carpets) can release PFAS chemicals when dumped into the landfill (Gallen et al., 2016;Wei et al., 2019;Yan et al., 2015;Lang et al., 2017). As a result, PFAS can be released into the groundwater through contaminated leachates from landfills, or laterally move to surrounding land areas if appropriate lining is not in place (SI Figure 2). In addition to sewage and wastewater, industrial wastes such as fabrics, building and coating materials can be a diffuse source of PFAS and their related chemicals (Janousek et al., 2019) when they are disposed in landfill sites. For example, long-chain PFAAs (e.g., PFOA and its precursors) were detected in landfill sites where the above types of wastes were dumped off for disposal. Knutsen et al. (2019) warned that short-chain PFAS compounds released from a range of household and industrial wastes could dominate over long-chain compounds in the leachates of historic landfill sites. The removal of such short-chain PFAS contaminants from water can be extremely challenging, which, in addition to the general challenges of landfill leachate treatment methods, underscores the PFAS contamination issue worldwide in ground and surface water resources from landfill sites.Household wastes composed of goods containing hydrophobic and stain-resistant coatings (e.g., carpets) can release PFAS chemicals when dumped into the landfill (Gallen et al., 2016;Wei et al., 2019;Yan et al., 2015;Lang et al., 2017).

        <p>PFAS compounds that reach soil through various sources (Table 2) can undergo sorption, partition, and complexation reactions that enable them to be retained in the soil (Zhang et al., 2019). Sorption refers to electrostatic interaction of PFAS with charged clay and organic matter surfaces, whereas partition refers to hydrophobic interaction of PFAS with organic substrates such as soil organic matter. Complexation involves partition of PFAS with dissolved organic matter forming soluble PFAS-organic matter complexes (Li et al., 2018;Zhu and Kannan, 2019). In contrast, plant uptake, leaching, degradation/transformation, and volatilization potentially can remove these chemicals from contaminated soils (Figure 2). The dynamics of PFAS compounds and their fate in the soil depend on the characteristics of PFAS compounds (e.g., solubility and chain length), soil properties (e.g., organic matter and pH), and environmental factors (e.g., precipitation) (Milinovic et al., 2015). PFAS compounds can be adsorbed on soil particles through hydrophobic interaction and/or electrostatic attraction (Johnson et al., 2007;Wei et al., 2019). The major PFAS compounds such as PFOA and PFOS tend to exist as dissociated anions of acids under natural soil environmental conditions. PFAS compounds in the soil system can show both hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics.PFAS compounds that reach soil through various sources (Table 2) can undergo sorption, partition, and complexation reactions that enable them to be retained in the soil (Zhang et al., 2019).

PFAS compounds can be adsorbed on soil particles through hydrophobic interaction and/or electrostatic attraction (Johnson et al., 2007;Wei et al., 2019). The major PFAS compounds such as PFOA and PFOS tend to exist as dissociated anions of acids under natural soil environmental conditions. PFAS compounds in the soil system can show both hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics.</p>
        <p>While the long-fluorinated alkyl chain of PFAS compounds confers on them hydrophobic properties, the sulfonate and carboxylate functional groups provide them hydrophilic characteristics (Darlington et al., 2018;Ross et al., 2018). Vapor state mobility of PFAS compounds may rarely occur under soil environmental conditions, because of the low to very low vapor pressures of most of the PFAS compounds (Kucharzyk et al., 2017), or in other words these compounds have high molecular weight and are highly stable in nature.While the long-fluorinated alkyl chain of PFAS compounds confers on them hydrophobic properties, the sulfonate and carboxylate functional groups provide them hydrophilic characteristics (Darlington et al., 2018;Ross et al., 2018).

        <p>This section covers both sorption as indicated by electrostatic interaction of PFAS with charged clay and organic matter surfaces, and partition as indicated by hydrophobic interaction of PFAS with organic substrates such as soil organic matter. Because of simultaneously having hydrophobic fluoroalkyl long chains and hydrophilic ionizable functional groups, PFAS compounds show complex behaviours in the environment in terms of their sorption and desorption processes (Ahrens, 2011;Kannan, 2011). The sorption of PFAS in soils has been shown to increase with an increase in the chain length of PFAS compounds and also with an increase in the fraction of organic components (foc) in the soil (Brusseau et al., 2018;Milinovic et al., 2015). Simultaneously, PFAS sorption is also influenced by the soil pH and soil solution ionic strength. It has been shown that PFAS sorption in soil increases with an increasing electrolyte concentration (i.e., ionic strength) and/or due to the presence of higher valent cations in the soil solution (Wang and Shih, 2011). A decreasing pH of the soil (i.e., dominance of protons (H + ) on the soil surface) also increases the sorption of PFAS compounds, which is attributed mainly to an increase in positive charge with decreasing pH (Du et al., 2014;Jeon et al., 2011;Bolan et al., 1999). Therefore, two key mechanisms can be identified for PFAS sorption in the soil environment: (1) hydrophobic interaction with soil particles rich in aromatic hydrophobic components, and (2) surface electrostatic interaction with charged soil minerals (Figure 3; Hellsing et al., 2016).This section covers both sorption as indicated by electrostatic interaction of PFAS with charged clay and organic matter surfaces, and partition as indicated by hydrophobic interaction of PFAS with organic substrates such as soil organic matter.

        <p>The sorption of PFAS compounds in soils and sediments has been studied extensively. In general, long chain PFAS compounds are adsorbed in soils and sediments dominantly via hydrophobic attraction, and short chain compounds via polar-polar interaction (e.g., electrostatic attraction) (Zhao et al., 2012). Soils and sediments containing high contents of organic carbon (OC) or black carbon particles thus tend to show high sorption of PFAS compounds. The physicochemical behaviours of PFAS compounds, especially the net hydrophobicity evolving from their chemical structures are critical to predict the sorption strengths of these chemicals to soils and sediments. For example, Milinvic et al. (2015) reported that among three studied PFAS compounds, namely PFOS, PFOA and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), PFOS was the most strongly adsorbed by six different soils. The authors attributed the strong interaction of PFOSs with soil particles to hydrophobic interaction, as indicated by a strong correlation between the log Kow values of the three PFAS compounds and the log Koc values of the soils (Figure 4). Chen et al. (2013) demonstrated that PFOS and PFOA sorption (Kd value) increased with an increase of the organic carbon fraction and ionic strength of five different soils, whereas the sorption decreased with an increasing humic acid (HA) concentration in the solution. The authors suggested that HA or other dissolved organic matter might form complexes with PFAS compounds in the soil solution and inhibit sorption of those chemicals on to soil components such as clay minerals and particulate organic matter. Hellsing et al. (2016) found that a negatively charged silica surface was not able to adsorb anionic PFAS compounds such as perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), PFOA, PFOS, and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). On the contrary, positively charged alumina surface adsorbed significant amounts of these compounds, indicating that an electrostatic mechanism might come into partial effect for adsorbing PFAS compounds on electrically charged soil components (Higgins and Luthy, 2006). Johnson et al. (2007) suggested that PFOS sorption mechanisms to the surfaces of minerals such as kaolinite, goethite, high iron sand, and Ottawa sand could be dominantly controlled by electrostatic attraction when surfaces of these minerals were OC free. The presence of organic carbon of the mineral surfaces drives the sorption mechanism toward hydrophobic interaction. According to their charge characteristics, the above minerals adsorbed PFOS in the order: goethite &gt; kaolinite &gt; high iron sand &gt; Ottawa sand. Tang et al. (2010) observed that pH, ionic strength, and Ca 2+ concentration of solutions significantly influenced the sorption of PFOS by goethite, but their effects were only marginal when sorption occurred on silica. In the case of goethite, low pH values and high Ca 2+ concentrations enhanced PFOS sorption via possible electrostatic attraction. Likewise, Ferrey et al. (2012) suggested that at around solution pH = 7, iron oxides adsorbed PFOS and PFOA predominantly through electrostatic attraction rather than hydrophobic interaction.The sorption of PFAS compounds in soils and sediments has been studied extensively.

        <p>Literature suggests that PFAS sorption and desorption studies are mostly concentrated on soils and sediments, where point source pollution occurred mainly surrounding AFFF handling and storage facilities. However, due to the high mobility of these compounds, reports now exist that agricultural soils globally are also contaminated or vulnerable for contamination by these toxic compounds (Yao et al., 2015). The sorption and desorption behaviour of PFAS in agricultural soils can be different than that of other soils, because agricultural soils receive a continuous supply of amendments, fertilizers, and irrigation water. Therefore, understanding the retention of PFAS in agricultural soils requires future research attention, and the fate and behaviour of these contaminants should be studied using advanced biogeochemical prediction models.Literature suggests that PFAS sorption and desorption studies are mostly concentrated on soils and sediments, where point source pollution occurred mainly surrounding AFFF handling and storage facilities.

        <p>Most PFAS compounds are relatively more soluble in water than other persistent organic pollutants such as PAHs (Post et al., 2017). Hence, PFASs are liable for leaching, especially in soils with low sorption capacity (e.g., sandy soils). The sorption of the PFAS compounds in soils influences their leaching behaviour through the soil profile (Gellrich et al., 2012). Gellrich et al (2012) observed that in groundwater, PFASs with short chain lengths (&lt;7 fluorinated carbon atoms) predominate in concentrations. The short chain PFASs can be less toxic than long chain ones (e.g., PFOS and PFOA); short chain PFASs display a higher mobility but lower bioaccumulation potential in the environment (Das et al., 2008;Newsted et al., 2008;Gellrich et al., 2012). However, despite the restricted use of PFAS, the concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in water and other environmental matrices are likely to increase because of (1) the continuous desorption of PFOS and PFOA that are still bound to soil particles, and (2) the slow transformation of precursors of these compounds in environmental compartments (Frömel and Knepper, 2010). Gellrich et al. (2012) detected PFOA in the leachate percolating through a soil column until about four months after the experiment began, but PFOS was found below the detection limit (1 ng/L) even after 2.5 years. Similarly, Stahl et al. (2013) reported that PFOA moved rapidly with water through a soil lysimeter, while PFOS travelled slowly (SI Figure 3).Most PFAS compounds are relatively more soluble in water than other persistent organic pollutants such as PAHs (Post et al., 2017).

        <p>Thus, the leaching behaviour of PFAS is in part influenced by the extent to which the PFAS is adsorbed onto soil and sediments during transport. The sorption of PFAS onto soil and sediments during transport facilitates partial removal of PFAS from aqueous media, which potentially retards PFAS flow velocity relative to the velocity of water, thereby attenuating the concentration of PFASs over distance and time across the stream (Higgins and Luthy, 2006;Li et al., 2019;Ross et al., 2018).Thus, the leaching behaviour of PFAS is in part influenced by the extent to which the PFAS is adsorbed onto soil and sediments during transport.

        <p>Unlike nonpolar contaminants (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons) that tend to accumulate on plant root surfaces via lipid partitioning, polar contaminants including PFAS may enter into the transpiration stream of plants and move across the whole system (Ahrens et al., 2009;Blaine et al., 2013;Dalahmeh et al., 2018;Garcia-Valcarcel et al., 2014). For those contaminants that enter the transpiration stream, the ratio of concentrations of the solute in the transpiration stream to the soil solution is defined as the transpiration stream concentration factor (TSCF) (Felizeter et al., 2012).Unlike nonpolar contaminants (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons) that tend to accumulate on plant root surfaces via lipid partitioning, polar contaminants including PFAS may enter into the transpiration stream of plants and move across the whole system (Ahrens et al., 2009;Blaine et al., 2013;Dalahmeh et al., 2018;Garcia-Valcarcel et al., 2014).

        <p>Plant uptake of PFAS compounds is dependent on PFAS chain length and the sorption behaviour in soils. Being relatively hydrophilic, the short chain PFAS are expected to have high TSCF values. Since ionisable contaminants such as PFAS are soluble and non-volatile, a high concentration of PFAS can potentially accumulate in plants (Ghisi et al., 2019). PFAS accumulation occurs predominately in the leaves, because water along with PFAS enters into the roots and then translocates to the leaves before getting evaporated, resulting in the accumulation of PFAS in the leaves (Ghisi et al., 2019). The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of PFAS can be calculated as follows (Liu et al., 2017):Plant uptake of PFAS compounds is dependent on PFAS chain length and the sorption behaviour in soils.

        <p>Only a few studies have documented the bioaccumulation potential of PFAS, particularly PFOA and PFOS, into food crops (SI Figure 4). In an artificially contaminated soil, Stahl et al. (2009) observed an uptake of PFOS and PFOA in maize, wheat, potato, and oats, and particularly high concentrations accumulated in the vegetative portions of the plants. Lechner et al. (2011) also reported similar PFOA and PFOS uptake patterns in the vegetative portions of carrot, cucumber, and potato. Blaine et al. (2013) found that the dry weight concentrations of PFBA and PFPeA in plants grown in a PFAS-contaminated biosolid-amended soil under glasshouse conditions reached 266 and 236 µg/kg in lettuce, and 56 and 211 µg/kg in tomato, respectively. PFBA showed the highest BAF (56.8) in the case of lettuce, while the highest BAF for PFPeA was 17.1 in the case of tomato. Under field conditions, while no PFBA and PFPeA were detected in corn grains, concentrations of the chemicals in the corn stover were ultralow (Blaine et al., 2013). In another study, Blaine et al. (2014a) found that among various PFAS compounds present in a contaminated biosolid-amended soil, crops such as radish, celery, and pea accumulated the highest concentrations of PFOA (67 µg/kg), PFBA (232 µg/kg), and PFBA (150 µg/kg), respectively.

        <p>Under greenhouse conditions, Blaine et al. (2013) also monitored the entry of PFAS into the human food chain via irrigating food crops (lettuce and strawberry) with reclaimed water (PFAS concentration = 0.2-40 µg/L). PFBA and PFPeA (short-chain PFAS) showed the overall highest accumulation of any PFAS in the edible parts of both the crops. The authors also reported that the OC content of soils had an inverse relationship with the bioaccumulation of PFAS. Zhu and Kannan ( 2019) conducted a field study within a one-mile radius of a fivedecade old fluoropolymer (PFCA) industry and observed that, while the soil samples and plant tissues contained mainly PFOA, the earthworms accounted for higher proportions of longchain PFCAs (e.g., PFUnDA and PFDoDA). The biota-soil accumulation factor in earthworms and root-soil accumulation factor in plants/grasses increased with an increasing chain length of the PFCAs. Thus, the bioaccumulation of PFAS in crops from soils would depend on PFAS concentration, soil properties, crop species, and the specific PFAS analyte, and it is not clearly understood. Also, reports concerning PFAS bioaccumulation in beneficial soil animals such as earthworms are scant (Karnjanapiboonwong et al., 2018;Zhao et al., 2013;Zhu and Kannan, 2019), and, given the importance of these animals in ecosystem functions, it warrants future studies.Under greenhouse conditions, Blaine et al.

        <p>The major transformation processes of PFAS include abiotic and biotic degradation with a limited extent of volatilization. Transformation of various precursor substances can provide an indirect source of PFAS input to soils (Ruan et al., 2015). For example, fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs; F(CF2)nCH2CH2OH) are some of the major indirect sources of PFAS input in soil (Dinglasan et al., 2004;Yuan et al., 2016). Studies showed that FTOHs might undergo degradation and produce secondary chemicals such as polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), fluorotelomer aldehydes, and secondary polyfluorinated alcohols (Liu et al., 2007;Liu et al., 2010;Zhao et al., 2017).

The profiles of FTOH degradation products varied depending on the bacterial strains involved. For example, mixed bacterial strains yielded equal amounts of PFCAs and x:3 acids, and a small amount of other transient intermediates (Liu et al., 2010;Zhao et al., 2013a;Zhao et al., 2013b). In contrast, a single strain of Pseudomonas sp. transformed 6:2 FTOH yielding a high quantity of transient intermediates and low quantities of PFCAs and x:3 acids (Kim et al., 2012).

        <p>FTOHs biodegradation rates and pathways differed among aerobic/anoxic/anaerobic conditions, with the first-order rate constants in the following decreasing order: aerobic &gt; anoxic &gt; anaerobic conditions (Yu et al., 2016). The anaerobic biodegradation of FTOH was found inefficient to produce PFCAs, but might form polyfluorinated acids (Zhang et al., 2013b). FTOHs could also be transformed by terrestrial plants and animals. For example, Zhao and Zhu (2017) observed that 10:2 FTOH was biotransformed to PFDA, PFNA, and PFOA by soil microorganisms, PFDA, PFHxA and PFPeA by wheat roots, and PFDA and PFNA by earthworms (Eisenia foetida). In the atmosphere, peroxy radical reactions could degrade FTOHs producing a series of homologous PFCAs (Ellis et al., 2004), which also contributes to widespread contamination of PFCAs in soil. Other fluorotelomer derivatives, such as fluorotelomer sulfonate, polyfluoroalkyl phosphate, fluorotelomer acrylate, and fluorotelomer stearate monoester, could act as precursors of FTOHs, which could subsequently be subjected to the same degradation pathways as mentioned above to form PFCAs (Lee et al., 2010;Russell et al., 2008;Butt et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2011;Lewis et al., 2016;Zhang et al., 2016b;Liu and Liu, 2016;Dasu et al., 2012).FTOHs biodegradation rates and pathways differed among aerobic/anoxic/anaerobic conditions, with the first-order rate constants in the following decreasing order: aerobic &gt; anoxic &gt; anaerobic conditions (Yu et al., 2016).

        <p>Remediating PFAS contaminated solid and aqueous media can be extremely challenging because of the following key reasons: (1) high chemical and thermal stability of PFAS compounds, (2) frequent occurrence of complex mixture of PFAS compounds in the contaminated environment, (3) unique physicochemical properties of PFAS compounds (i.e., both hydrophobic and oleophobic behaviours), and (4) extremely persistent nature (i.e., limited or no biodegradation). Although various methods have been reported to remove PFAS compounds from aqueous media (Carter et al., 2010;Ding and Peijnenburg, 2013;Du et al., 2014;Wagner et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2011), these methods may not be readily applicable for remediating PFAS contaminated soils or waste materials (e.g., biosolids) (Darlington et al., 2018). Two broad approaches, namely mobilization and immobilization, using soil amendments, as discussed below, may prove logistically and economically viable for the remediation of PFAS contaminated soil. While an immobilization approach can be used to reduce mobility and bioavailability of PFAS, the mobilization approach can be used to remove PFAS through soil washing and phytoremediation.

        <p>Soil flushing is an in-situ process that involves injection of a flushing solution into the ground for extracting contaminants (Hale et al., 2017;Yao et al., 2015). The main advantage of soil flushing is that large quantities of soil can be treated in-situ without the need for excavation and transport (Jawitz et al., 2000;Svab et al., 2009;Zheng et al., 2012). Surfactants having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic structural groups are used to facilitate the desorption of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and subsequent soil flushing. However, many PFAS, including PFOS and PFOA, are themselves surfactants, which can make PFAS behaviour difficult to predict during PFAS mobilization. For example, Pan et al. (2009) found that a cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)) was able to significantly enhance the sorption of PFOS to sediments due to the initial sorption of CTAB to sediments, thereby exposing CTAB's hydrophobic tails to adsorb PFOS. However, an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl-benzene sulfonate (SDBS)) showed a concentration-dependent effect where a SDBS concentration &lt;4.34 mg/L increased PFOS sorption to sediments, but SDBS concentration &gt;21.7 mg/L increased PFOS desorption (Pan et al., 2009). Guelfo and Higgins (2013) found that an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)) at low concentration decreased the sorption of PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA, but increased the sorption of long chain PFAS, such as PFBA, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFHpA, and PFBS. In general, anionic surfactants could enhance the solubility of PFAS in water, which would decrease PFAS sorption to soils/sediments and, thereby, facilitate PFAS mobilization.Soil flushing is an in-situ process that involves injection of a flushing solution into the ground for extracting contaminants (Hale et al., 2017;Yao et al., 2015).

        <p>Powdered or granulated AC (GAC) was effective in removing PFOA and PFOS in soil and water (Cummings et al., 2015). A small number of commercial adsorbents (e.g., RemBind™, PefluorAd) available on the market could be used as a complement or as an alternative of AC (Birk, 2016). Clay mineral candidates, such as montmorillonite (Zhou et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 2014), kaolinite (Zhang et al., 2014;Zhao et al., 2014), hematite (Zhao et al., 2014), alumina (Wang and Shih, 2011), and boehmite (Wang et al., 2012), were used for batch-scale removal of PFAS compounds, specially focussing on PFOS. For example, Hale et al. (2017) tested AC, compost soil, and montmorillonite to immobilise PFAS in contaminated soils. PFAS leaching was reduced by 94-99.9, 29-34, and 28-40% for AC, compost, and montmorillonite amendments, respectively. Natural clay minerals have a hydrophilic surface, which is intrinsically negatively charged, rendering them ineffective for hydrophobic and anionic PFAS removal. However, when modified with a surfactant, its hydrophobic alkyl chain enhances PFAS sorption through hydrophobic partitioning. Additionally, in contrast to natural clay minerals, quaternary ammonium surfactant-modified products generate positive surface charge (Sarkar et al., 2011;2012), which could attract anionic PFOS and PFOA via electrostatic interaction. Das et al. (2013) reported the immobilization and reduced leaching of PFOS (&gt;90%) from four AFFF-contaminated soils using a palygorskite-based organoclay prepared with oleylamine. Like organoclays, a swellable organically modified silica was shown to outperform GAC for PFAS sorption (Figure 5), including short-chain PFAA compounds (Stebel et al., 2019). However, care should be taken in choosing the organic agents for modifying mineral materials, because chemicals such as oleylamine or hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium (HDTMA) can be extremely toxic to native soil micro-and macro-organisms (Sarkar et al., 2010;2013). Many factors including media characteristics, PFAS characteristics, and adsorbent characteristics would influence the overall effectiveness of PFAS remediation via sorption treatments (Darlington et al., 2018).

        <p>PFAS sorption decreases with increasing pH of the medium. While natural organic matter in the soil does not reduce the PFAS sorption capacity of activated carbon and clays, high ionic strength (i.e., high concentration of inorganic salts) adversely affects the sorption capacity of organoclays through the adsorbents' charge reversal behaviour (Das et al., 2013;Jeon et al., 2011;Sarkar et al., 2012). The presence of sulfonate functional groups can lead to strong sorption of PFAS. Physicochemical characteristics of adsorbents (e.g., SSA, pore size distribution, cation exchange capacity, zeta potential) also have a remarkable effect on PFAS sorption (Du et al., 2014;Jeon et al., 2011). Adsorbents with small pore size and high SSA can lead to high PFAS sorption capacity. Similarly, adsorbents with a basic or positively charged surface tend to show high PFAS sorption capacity through the combined mechanism of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction (Lu et al., 2016).PFAS sorption decreases with increasing pH of the medium.

The stabilizing/solidifying agents immobilize contaminants via physical and/or chemical protection.

(2020) have been able to achieve 71-99% thermal desorption of PFAS in a field contaminated soil at 550 o C, and &gt;99% desorption in a PFAS fortified soil.Thermal treatments of PFAS contaminated soil include both complete degradation of PFAS requiring high temperature (900-1100 o C) (Watanabe et al., 2016), and thermal desorption (Lim et al., 2016). The complete thermal degradation is covered under 'Vitrification or incineration' (Section 4.3.3).

(2005) tested whether fluorotelomer-treated textiles and paper, after being destroyed under municipal incinerator conditions, would form PFOA as a degradation product. There was no PFOA detected in the samples after incineration. Even if PFOA was formed during incineration, it must have also been destroyed in the process, meaning degradation of precursors during incineration would not be a significant PFOA source in the environment. There are several processes available to reach vitrification temperatures: electrical, thermal, and plasma. The electrical process is in situ and involves construction of a zone surrounded by graphite electrodes inserted in the ground which pass energy through the soil. The thermal process is ex situ and is generally carried out in a rotary kiln. Plasma processes are only necessary when temperatures of up to 5000 ºC are required. Electrical or thermal processes could be used to target the combustion of PFAS on site without using more extreme temperatures.ºC.

        <p>Mechanochemical destruction (MCD), or high energy ball milling, has recently gained attraction in the soil remediation sector due to its ability to destroy effectively POPs with no requirement for toxic solvents, extreme temperatures, harmful additives, or high pressures (Cagnetta et al., 2016). The mechanisms involved in mechanochemical transformations tend to be complex and dissimilar to reactions observed in other remediation processes, i.e., thermal, photochemical, and chemical oxidation. While heat is generated under ball milling conditions, it was disregarded as the sole reaction initiation mechanism because of the progression of mechanochemical reactions even at very low temperatures (i.e., 77 K) (Beyer et al., 2005).Mechanochemical destruction (MCD), or high energy ball milling, has recently gained attraction in the soil remediation sector due to its ability to destroy effectively POPs with no requirement for toxic solvents, extreme temperatures, harmful additives, or high pressures (Cagnetta et al., 2016).

        <p>In this method, water is used to extract PFAS from contaminated soil without any use of additional chemicals. The method is being applied in several projects using mobile equipment operated by a Swedish company, Svevia. Contaminated soil is excavated and loaded to a container where it is mixed with water. A high-pressure water stream is used to scrub the fines from coarser soil particles and dissolve some of the contaminants. Fines are then separated from coarser fractions for further management. The coarse (washed) particles are ejected and placed back to the pit after concentration of contaminants is checked through sampling and analysis. The method was tested on a pilot scale (10 tonnes) where 96% separation of PFOS from soil particles was achieved (Swedish EPA, 2018).In this method, water is used to extract PFAS from contaminated soil without any use of additional chemicals.

        <p>Soil washing was then applied on a full scale to soil from a site in Kalmar, Sweden, where firefighting exercises have been carried out for 10 years. The aim was to wash the soil in order to separate PFAS from soil particles, place cleaned particles back to the site, and clean the washing solution. Because PFAS are readily water soluble, it was expected that most of PFAS from soil could be removed and that the remediation goals could be reached. Fifty tonnes of soil were washed per batch. In the first two batches the achieved PFOS concentration in washed soil was 17µg/kg (remediation goal was set to 29 µg/kg). In the following two batches the remaining concentration in washed soil was above the remediation goal. The washing solution was first cleaned using ozonation, but it was not sufficient to reduce PFAS concentrations and active carbon filters were applied. Only 10% (150 of 1500 tonnes) of the planned soil volume got treated.

Considering this system with frequent harvest of shoot and birch sap, and an understory of ground elder, they estimated that it was possible to remove annually 1.4 g of ∑26PFASs/ha. The second scenario was the regular coppicing of birches, in which the tree trunks were left in the field but the twigs and leaves were harvested in every 3-5 years of rotation. Annually 5 tonnes/ha of biomass composed of twigs and leaves could be generated, leading to annually 0.65 g of extractable ∑26PFASs for birches. The third scenario was the preservation of a meadow composed of plant species with high PFAS uptake potential.

Soil amendments which are effective in the mobilization of PFAS compounds via desorption and complexation reactions can be applied to enhance the mobility and bioavailability, and subsequent removal through plant uptake and soil washing. Anionic surfactants can be effective in the mobilization of PFAS compounds, and their subsequent removal through soil washing. However, one of the environmental issues with the application of mobilization techniques is that the mobilized PFAS compounds are subject to leaching, particularly in the absence of plant uptake and soil washing, thereby leading to ground-water contamination.

        <p>Stabilization and solidification remediation treatment has been found to be an effective immobilization technology aimed at reducing leaching and bioavailability of PFAS compounds. However, a major intrinsic issue liked to immobilization techniques is that, although the PFAS compounds become less mobile and bioavailable, their total mass in soils remains unaffected. The immobilized PFAS compounds may be solubilized and become bioavailable with time through breakdown of organic-PFAS compounds complexes. Complete removal of PFAS compounds from solid media, including soil and biosolid waste, can be achieved through biotic and abiotic degradation and decomposition. Biodegradation of PFAS is slow and not readily applicable under field conditions to treat large volumes of contaminated matrix.
