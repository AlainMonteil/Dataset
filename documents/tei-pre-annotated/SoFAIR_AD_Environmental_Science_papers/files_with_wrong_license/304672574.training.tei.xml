        <p>Climate change mitigation and poverty alleviation provide mutual benefits. On the one hand, mitigating climate change, through reducing emissions, can have a positive effect on poverty alleviation 7 but might require pro-poor measures 8 . For example, the clean development mechanism has created jobs for rural areas with a simultaneous increase in income, which helps the poor 9 . On the other hand, strategies and policies focused on the poor are of great significance for achieving emission-reduction targets 10 ; for example, providing a daily living wage might have considerable carbon implications 11,12 . There is growing understanding that the increase in income resulting from economic growth is not sufficient to reduce poverty and inequality if it is not inclusive and if it does not take careful account of the three key dimensions of sustainable development-economic, social and environmental 13 .Climate change mitigation and poverty alleviation provide mutual benefits.

        <p>China aims to consider social equality in its climate change actions by allocating more responsibilities for climate change mitigation to its wealthier regions 14 . The government has targeted reductions in energy intensity and carbon intensity of 15% and 18%, respectively, during the 13th five-year period (2016-2020) 15 , and the wealthiest eastern provinces (such as Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin) are required to reduce their energy intensity by 17%, while the targets in some poorer western provinces (such as Tibet, Qinghai and Xinjiang) are 10%. There are also many examples of making climate mitigation pro-poor 16 , especially with regard to removal of subsidies for fossil fuels 17 . In addition to studies of taxes and subsidies in developed countries, the politics of reform efforts in developing regions has been widely researched 18 . However, climate change researchers have rarely considered equality at the household level in China, and this needs to be explored and analysed 19 .China aims to consider social equality in its climate change actions by allocating more responsibilities for climate change mitigation to its wealthier regions 14 .

        <p>Many studies have estimated the inequality of carbon emissions at national 20 or sub-national levels 21 , while studies comparing household-level carbon inequality are still limited 22 . Hubacek et al. 11,23 estimated the carbon footprints of four household groups in 30 developed countries and 90 developing countries. The results show that the top 10% of income earners were responsible for 36% of global carbon emissions in 2010, while the bottom half of global income earners caused only approximately 13%. There are more studies at the national level. López et al. 24 compared the household carbon footprints for eight social groups in Spain and found that higher-income households imported more carbon emissions compared with lower-income households.

This study applied an environmentally extended multiregional input-output approach to estimate household carbon footprints for 12 different income groups of China's 30 regions. Subsequently, carbon footprint Gini coefficients were calculated to measure carbon inequality for households across provinces. We found that the top 5% of income earners were responsible for 17% of the national household carbon footprint in 2012, while the bottom half of income earners caused only 25%. Carbon inequality declined with economic growth in China across space and time in two ways: first, carbon footprints showed greater convergence in the wealthier coastal regions than in the poorer inland regions; second, China's national carbon footprint Gini coefficients declined from 0.44 in 2007 to 0.37 in 2012. We argue that economic growth not only increases income levels but also contributes to an overall reduction in carbon inequality in China. input-output tables and thus ignores regional disparities in income as well as notable regional differences in production technologies, fuel mix and economic structure. For example, Wiedenhofer et al. 4 measured national inequality of household carbon footprints across five rural income groups and eight urban income groups in China. We extended their research from both time and space perspectives, using multiregional input-output (MRIO) models. Specifically, we used the latest socioeconomic datasets to compile China's 2012 MRIO table and estimated household carbon footprints for 12 income groups (five rural and seven urban) in 30 Chinese provinces in 2007 and 2012. The inequality in the household carbon footprint was quantified with a carbon footprint Gini (CF-Gini) coefficient. Important findings are that while the average per capita carbon footprint in most poor provinces increased and those in some wealthy provinces declined, carbon inequality declines with economic growth in China across space and time.

        <p>China's households contributed 34% of the national carbon footprint in 2012 (see Supplementary Tables 1 and2 for consumption-based emissions of China's 30 provinces). The remainder was induced by government consumption (7%), fixed capital formation (57%) and inventory change (3%). We do not attempt to attribute this 66% to households.China's households contributed 34% of the national carbon footprint in 2012 (see Supplementary Tables 1 and2 for consumption-based emissions of China's 30 provinces).

        <p>Carbon footprint. The proportion of carbon footprint attributed to households is relatively lower in China than in developed countries. For example, the household shares of the carbon footprint in the United States and the United Kingdom were 70% and 69%, respectively, in 2012. There are notable differences in household carbon contributions across provinces in China. In Guangdong and Shanghai, for example, households were responsible for 48% and 47%, respectively, of the total carbon footprint in 2012. By comparison, the household shares of the carbon footprint were only 24% and 27%, respectively, in the two less-developed provinces Ningxia and Shanxi in western China.Carbon footprint.

        <p>At the national level, China's household carbon footprint increased by 27%, or 2,113 million tons of CO 2 (MtCO 2 ), between 2007 and 2012, with 72% of this increase being due to consumption in urban areas. The household carbon footprint increased much faster in poorer western regions than in wealthier eastern regions; specifically, it increased by 37%, 32% and 21%, respectively, in western, central and eastern China. Although western China is relatively poor compared with eastern China, its growth rates in consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) have been much faster since the global financial crisis. At the provincial level, the household carbon footprint increased in most provinces. For example, the household carbon footprints of Guangxi and Shaanxi, two provinces in western China, increased by 39% and 37%, respectively, while the household carbon footprints in the three most affluent provinces-Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai-decreased by 22%, 6% and 5%, respectively, mainly due to the decline (percentage changed in this ratio) in carbon intensity (that is, CO 2 emissions per unit of economic output) and the effect of outsourcing pollution 25 . The carbon intensities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin declined by 53%, 32% and 37%, respectively, between 2007 and 2012, and the share of low-carbon goods and services in household consumption increased in these provinces. Between 2007 and 2012, for example, the proportions of wholesale and retailing products and of leasing and commercial services in Beijing's household expenditure increased by 2 and 3 percentage points, respectively.At the national level, China's household carbon footprint increased by 27%, or 2,113 million tons of CO 2 (MtCO 2 ), between 2007 and 2012, with 72% of this increase being due to consumption in urban areas.

        <p>Per capita carbon footprint. The per capita household carbon footprint varies greatly across China's provinces, but wealthy regions usually have a higher per capita carbon footprint than poor regions. In 2007, the per capita carbon footprints of three affluent eastern coastal provinces (Tianjin, Shanghai and Beijing) were over 4.0 tCO 2 while those in central and western provinces (Hainan, Guangxi, Henan and Yunnan) were less than 1.0 tCO 2 (Fig. 1). For example, the per capita carbon footprint in Beijing, the capital of China, was 4.2 tCO 2 , which was over five times that in Guangxi, a poorer western province. In 2012, Inner Mongolia was the province with the highest per capita household carbon footprint (4.4 tCO 2 ), which was four times the smallest one (1.1 tCO 2 in Jiangxi). Inner Mongolia is a western province, and its household consumption increased rapidly between 2007 and 2012. Moreover, Inner Mongolia is one of the main providers of coal-fired electricity, which has a higher carbon intensity. For example, Inner Mongolia provides large amounts of electricity to neighbouring regions, with 133 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) in net electricity exports in 2012. China's national average per capita carbon footprint increased by 23% from 1.6 tCO 2 in 2007 to 2.0 tCO 2 in 2012. Average per capita carbon footprints in most poorer provinces increased while those in some wealthier provinces declined. Overall, China's regional carbon inequality declined between 2007 and 2012. We further explored whether conditional convergence exists in China. Our estimates show that the provinces with the lowest per capita carbon footprint in 2007 were the provinces in which the carbon footprint grew the most from 2007 to 2012. By estimating convergences but differentiating between rural and urban households, results show that the convergence occurred more rapidly in urban households (see Supplementary Fig. 1).Per capita carbon footprint.

        <p>Urban residents, accounting for 53% of China's population, induced 74% of the national household carbon footprint in 2012. The average per capita footprint of urban residents was 2.8 tCO 2 in 2012, which was 2.5 times that of rural residents (1.1 tCO 2 ), while the average per capita expenditure was 2.9 times that of rural residents. Figure 2 shows the per capita carbon footprints of 12 income groups in 30 of China's provinces in 2012. The per capita carbon footprint is much higher for urban residents than for rural residents across all provinces. The gap in per capita carbon footprints between urban and rural residents is much larger in poorer western China. For example, the per capita carbon footprint of urban residents in Guizhou (Fig. 2, row 6, column 5), whose GDP per capita was the smallest in China in 2012, was 2.7 times that of Guizhou's rural residents. By comparison, the per capita carbon footprints of urban residents in Beijing (Fig. 2, row 1, column 2) and Shanghai (Fig. 2, row 6, column 3), two of the most affluent regions in China, were in both cases 'only' 1.3 times the footprint of their respective rural residents.Urban residents, accounting for 53% of China's population, induced 74% of the national household carbon footprint in 2012.

        <p>It is surprising that the income groups with the highest per capita household carbon footprint are mostly located in relatively poor provinces (see Supplementary Table 3). The per capita carbon footprints of very wealthy urban groups in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Xinjiang were 16.9, 10.9 and 10.1 tCO 2 in 2012, respectively, which were similar to the estimated range for the United States (10.4 to 20 tCO 2 ) (refs. 4,26,27 ). The per capita household expenditure of the top 10% in terms of urban income in Inner Mongolia was ¥45,246, and even higher than that of the top 10% of the urban income earners in Beijing (¥45,190) and Tianjin (¥41,214). Although the per capita household expenditures of the top 10% of the urban groups in Inner Mongolia and Beijing were almost equal, the two groups had a large gap in their per capita household carbon footprints (Fig. 2). This is caused mainly by the differences in their carbon intensity. The carbon intensity of Inner Mongolia was 149 g ¥ -1 in 2012, which was the highest among the 30 Chinese provinces and approximately 10 times that in Beijing (15 g ¥ -1 ). One possible reason for this difference is the higher number of heating days and availability of natural resources influencing the fuel mix 28 .It is surprising that the income groups with the highest per capita household carbon footprint are mostly located in relatively poor provinces (see Supplementary Table 3).

One possible reason for this difference is the higher number of heating days and availability of natural resources influencing the fuel mix 28 .</p>
        <p>In addition, relatively low administrative efficiency and loose environmental regulations result in high levels of carbon emissions. For example, Inner Mongolia struggles to design an appropriate path for economic development accompanied by a low carbon transition in consumption patterns 29 . The carbon intensities of Heilongjiang and Xinjiang were 79 and 129 g ¥ -1 in 2012, respectively, which were also above China's national average (50 g ¥ -1 ). In addition to the carbon intensity, the different consumption patterns of households in poor and rich regions play an important role in the discrepancy (see Supplementary Table 4). For example, rural areas in relatively poor provinces in 2012, including Inner Mongolia (1.22 tCO 2 ), Shanxi (1.13 tCO 2 ) and Ningxia (1.07 tCO 2 ), show relatively high per capita carbon footprints in terms of residence expenditure, with this item closely related to high energy-consuming indirect sectoral emissions and direct household emissions. Simultaneously, the consumption from different sources (that is, local production, domestic inflow or international imports) can partially explain the discrepancy (see Supplementary Table 5). Household consumption in poorer provinces has a higher proportion of local production but lower proportions of both domestic inflow and international import.In addition, relatively low administrative efficiency and loose environmental regulations result in high levels of carbon emissions.

        <p>The income groups with the lowest per capita household carbon footprint are also located mostly in relatively poor provinces (see Supplementary Table 6). The per capita carbon footprints of the poor rural income groups in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hainan and Yunnan were only 0.4 tCO 2 in 2012, which was less than half of the average in India in 2011 (0.9 tCO 2 ) (ref. 4 ). This is due mainly to their lower household expenditure: per capita household expenditure for the poor rural income groups in these four provinces was approximately ¥3,000 in 2012, which was only a quarter of China's national average (¥11,990).The income groups with the lowest per capita household carbon footprint are also located mostly in relatively poor provinces (see Supplementary Table 6). The per capita carbon footprints of the poor rural income groups in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hainan and Yunnan were only 0.4 tCO 2 in 2012, which was less than half of the average in India in 2011 (0.9 tCO 2 ) (ref. 4 ).

        <p>Carbon inequality. We measure household carbon inequality using CF-Gini coefficients, with zero representing perfect equality and one representing perfect inequality. Carbon inequality declines with economic growth in China. At the national level, China's CF-Gini coefficient declined from 0.44 in 2007 to 0.37 in 2012 (Fig. 3), while the officially released Gini coefficient for income dropped slightly from 0.48 in 2007 to 0.47 in 2012 30 . In 2012, the top 5% of income earners were responsible for 17% of the national household carbon footprint, while the bottom half of income earners caused only 25%. At the provincial level, the CF-Gini coefficients of the wealthier eastern coastal provinces were much lower than those of the poorer western provinces. In 2012, the four most affluent provinces (Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangsu), whose GDPs per capita were over ¥68,000 in 2012, had the lowest CF-Gini coefficients (0.19, 0.16, 0.14 and 0.18, respectively). By comparison, the CF-Gini coefficients of Xinjiang and Guizhou, two western provinces, were 0.40 and 0.38, respectively, which were higher than China's national CF-Gini coefficient in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012, the CF-Gini coefficients of most provinces declined, except for Jiangxi and Chongqing (see Supplementary Fig. 3), and the inequality in less-developed western provinces declined faster. For example, the CF-Gini coefficients of Sichuan and Qinghai declined by 0.21 and 0.20, respectively. On the basis of these observations, it can be concluded that carbon inequality declines with economic growth in China across space and time (see Supplementary Table 7 for details).Carbon inequality.

In 2012, the four most affluent provinces (Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and Jiangsu), whose GDPs per capita were over ¥68,000 in 2012, had the lowest CF-Gini coefficients (0.19, 0.16, 0.14 and 0.18, respectively). By comparison, the CF-Gini coefficients of Xinjiang and Guizhou, two western provinces, were 0.40 and 0.38, respectively, which were higher than China's national CF-Gini coefficient in 2012. Between 2007 and 2012, the CF-Gini coefficients of most provinces declined, except for Jiangxi and Chongqing (see Supplementary Fig. 3), and the inequality in less-developed western provinces declined faster. For example, the CF-Gini coefficients of Sichuan and Qinghai declined by 0.21 and 0.20, respectively. On the basis of these observations, it can be concluded that carbon inequality declines with economic growth in China across space and time (see Supplementary Table 7 for details).</p>
        <p>The estimated CF-Gini declined across all expenditure categories of national, urban and rural households from 2007 to 2012, with a simultaneous decline of income Gini, excluding rural education (Fig. 4), while changes in provincial CF-Gini varied among the expenditure categories during this period (see Supplementary 8 and9). This reflects the close linkage of carbon inequality with consumption volume (Supplementary Table 4) and expenditure pattern (Supplementary Table 5). To reduce the CF-Gini requires an increase in income of the poor (indicating the importance of eradicating poverty) and changes of lifestyles and consumption patterns and thus the reduction of carbon emissions of higher-income households. To avoid larger consumption-based emissions, appropriate carbon mitigation measures are needed; otherwise, a declining CF-Gini leads to larger overall emissions. By encouraging greener lifestyles, especially among wealthy groups, carbon footprints can be reduced by changes in expenditure structures towards low-carbon goods and products, thereby mitigating climate change. In addition, demographic change, for example, a dynamic composition of population through rural-urban migration, can also be an influence. When the rural poor move to urban areas and climb the income (and thus consumption) ladder, the CF-Gini tends to decrease.The estimated CF-Gini declined across all expenditure categories of national, urban and rural households from 2007 to 2012, with a simultaneous decline of income Gini, excluding rural education (Fig. 4), while changes in provincial CF-Gini varied among the expenditure categories during this period (see Supplementary 8 and9).

        <p>There are large inequalities between household carbon footprints within and across China's provinces. First, the per capita carbon footprint of urban residents is 2.5 times the footprint of rural residents. China's economy has been growing rapidly, but there is still a visible urban-rural divide in the nation. This is one of the greatest challenges for China's sustainable development. Urban residents have much higher household incomes and more modern lifestyles, resulting in higher carbon footprints compared with rural residents.There are large inequalities between household carbon footprints within and across China's provinces.

        <p>Second, the per capita carbon footprint varies greatly across China's provinces. In general, the per capita carbon footprint is larger in the wealthier coastal regions than in the poorer inland regions. From a production perspective, China's western region is more carbon intensive due to its reliance on coal-based heavy industry, relatively lower efficiency and weaker environmental regulations. From a consumption perspective, however, most of the high emissions-intensive goods produced in western China are consumed by residents in eastern China, and more emissions are ultimately exported to other regions than locally consumed in the west. China has made great efforts to balance economic development among the provinces and to narrow the gap between the east and the west, such as with the Western Development Strategy. Since the global financial crisis, the growth in consumption and GDP has Third, the size of the carbon footprint varies across income groups in China. The per capita carbon footprint of the wealthiest groups in Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Xinjiang was similar to the average level in the United States, while the per capita carbon footprint of the poorest groups in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hainan and Yunnan was only 0.4 tCO 2 , which was less than half of the average carbon footprint in India.Second, the per capita carbon footprint varies greatly across China's provinces.

        <p>Carbon inequality has declined with economic growth in China. We argue that economic growth not only increases income levels but also contributes to higher shares of low-carbon consumption items in higher-income groups and an overall reduction in carbon inequality in China. But overall, urban and wealthy regions tend to have a greater carbon footprint as a high income drives a high-carbon-footprint lifestyle. Hence, with the income growth and economic development experienced in China from 2007 to 2012, the overall size of the carbon footprint increased. However, we emphasize the significance of studying changes in carbon inequality in addition to the overall levels. Decarbonizing domestic production contributes to the decline of carbon intensity in China. The decline of carbon footprints in rich households contributed to decarbonization in rich regions; thus, there is a need to decarbonize poor areas as well. Although richer households consume more goods and have higher carbon footprints than lower income groups, they tend to consume a larger share of less-carbon-intensive items. Thus, the divergence declines. It is important to effectively decarbonize consumption patterns to reduce overall carbon footprints.Carbon inequality has declined with economic growth in China.

        <p>According to our research, carbon inequality has improved during this period and across provinces. Carbon footprints show less inequality in wealthier eastern coastal regions than in poorer western inland regions, and our results show that the income groups with the highest (and lowest) per capita carbon footprints are mostly located in relatively poor provinces. At the national level, China's CF-Gini coefficient declined from 0.44 in 2007 to 0.37 in 2012. At the provincial level, the CF-Gini coefficients of most provinces declined, with only two exceptions (Jiangxi and Chongqing). China has managed to decrease both income and carbon inequality during the observed period. There might be idiosyncratic and context-specific differences among developing countries, but the insights we gained achieving further decarbonization through changing the energy mix, improving carbon efficiencies in production and changes in consumption patterns should hold for other countries as well.According to our research, carbon inequality has improved during this period and across provinces.

        <p>Governments need to pay more attention to inequality at the household level when considering climate change mitigation actions. Although China has considered regional equality in distributing climate change mitigation responsibilities, equality at the household or individual level is seldom considered. The carbon footprint and corresponding CF-Gini coefficient are useful indicators for climate mitigation. According to the findings, the gap in carbon footprints can be narrowed by simultaneously increasing the incomes of the poor to eradicate poverty and changing the lifestyles of the wealthy to reduce the carbon intensity of their consumption patterns. In addition, there is nothing automatic about declining environmental impacts associated with economic growth. Improvements can be induced with appropriate legislation, monitoring and enforcement, as well as by inducing changes in consumption patterns with environmental taxation, information and eco-labels, and other policy tools. Carbon mitigation also does not automatically lead to a reduction in inequality as especially poorer households are frequently more affected by increases in prices of environmental resources, for example, through a carbon tax. In other words, carbon mitigation can be regressive, that is, affecting poorer households with higher carbon intensity more than richer households who can afford to have a higher share of services and other lower-carbon-consumption items. Therefore, mitigation actions need to be designed with the poorest segments of society in mind.Governments need to pay more attention to inequality at the household level when considering climate change mitigation actions.

        <p>This study applied an environmentally extended MRIO approach to estimate household carbon footprints for 12 income groups of China's 30 regions. CF-Gini coefficients were calculated to measure carbon inequality for households. 33 . China is one of the regions in the GTAP database, so we disaggregated the China-related sections in the GTAP model into 30-region and 30-sector tables according to our Chinese MRIO models. The new global MRIO then includes 30 Chinese provinces and 128 (or 139) countries with 30 sectors for Chinese provinces and 57 sectors for foreign countries. For the final demand, there are five sectors for Chinese provinces and three sectors for foreign countries (investment, household consumption and government consumption).This study applied an environmentally extended MRIO approach to estimate household carbon footprints for 12 income groups of China's 30 regions.

        <p>We chose the GTAP database because of the suitable region and sector classification. First, this study focuses on the carbon footprint in China. The emissions embodied in bilateral trade between China and developing countries are critical to the results of this study. However, many developing regions have been aggregated to 'rest of the world' in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and some other databases such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Inter-Country Input-Output Tables (OECD-ICIO), which introduces uncertainty. For example, the latest WIOD database covers 43 countries, including 7 developing regions, while the latest EXIOBASE database covers 8 developing regions. By contrast, the GTAP database covers 77 developing regions 34 . The Eora database has a heterogeneous classification, which impedes the comparing of results between countries. The harmonized version has 26 sectors, which is much fewer than the GTAP database. Sector aggregation has a great impact on MRIO uncertainty. The use of double deflation is to make the MRIO tables in 2007 and 2012 in constant price and thus comparable without inflation bias.We chose the GTAP database because of the suitable region and sector classification.

        <p>China has a high level of income inequality. The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of the income distribution of residents on a scale from complete equality (zero) to complete inequality (one) 38,39 . China's Gini coefficient is 0.55, compared with 0.5 for the United States and a global average of 0.44 (ref. 40 ). China's income inequality is in large measure due to the rural-urban gap and to notable regional disparities. For example, per capita income in Beijing is twice that in Xinjiang, and income of urban households is three times that of rural households 39 . In addition, in 2015, per capita income of the top 20% of households was over ten times that of the bottom 20% of households in China 41 .China has a high level of income inequality.

        <p>By 2012, China's poverty-alleviation policies included allocating financial payments of ¥300 billion by the central government, launching 11 pilot projects of contiguous poverty-stricken areas and achieving poverty-alleviating coverage of key national counties, thereby reducing the number of people living in poverty to 99 million 42 . Effective polices resulted in simultaneous declines in both CF-Gini and income Gini in China from 2007 to 2012. According to our estimates (see Supplementary Table 10), if changes in consumption are the same (3.63%) for the rural upper-middle group and the urban very poor group, the change in carbon footprint of the former (2.18%) is significantly higher than that of the latter (1.28%); on the basis of our simulations, we find that the urban very rich group would have to cut consumption, which is nearly twice that of the rural poor, to compensate for the increase in consumption associated with the increase in income of the poor. For example, the very rich urban consumers can reduce their very high carbon footprints, for example, associated with air travel and transport by private cars, by changing modes of transport or reducing their demand for travel. In addition to the aforementioned static comparison, carbon inequality reduction, poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation require a dynamic perspective, given substantial rural-urban migration, adoption of urban lifestyles and changes in the age composition, family size and important demographic variables (see Supplementary Table 11) 43 .

        <p>Household carbon footprints track how household consumption in a region causes carbon emissions elsewhere due to supply chains in the global economic network, taking into account interregional trade. It is important to better understand the uncertainty to deliver robust policy applications 51,52 . The uncertainty in this study lies mainly in the economic data, which include the national accounts and interregional trade and emission inventories. Previous estimates reported the uncertainty of country consumption-based carbon accounts in the range of 5-15% (ref. 53 ) and 2-16% (ref. 54 ). There is a consensus that the major source of uncertainty in the calculation of carbon footprint is associated mainly with the emission inventories rather than the economic data, supported by the comparable uncertainty range of production-based accounts and consumptionbased accounts 55 . The sources of uncertainty of the emission inventories used in this study have been clearly explained by our previous study 48 , which improved the Chinese emission accounting by using the emission factors based on the 602 coal samples from the 100 largest coal-mining areas in China. Moreover, the MRIO table used in China has also been validated by our previous study 49 . The interpretation of uncertainties in the results is a key limiting factor; more efforts are needed to develop a standardized procedure for uncertainty estimation.Household carbon footprints track how household consumption in a region causes carbon emissions elsewhere due to supply chains in the global economic network, taking into account interregional trade. It is important to better understand the uncertainty to deliver robust policy applications 51,52 . The uncertainty in this study lies mainly in the economic data, which include the national accounts and interregional trade and emission inventories. Previous estimates reported the uncertainty of country consumption-based carbon accounts in the range of 5-15% (ref. 53 ) and 2-16% (ref. 54 ).

        <p>This study aims to provide information to help policymakers understand the interactions and trade-offs between measures targeting inequality, poverty, and climate change mitigation. By estimating the carbon footprint of different income groups in China, this study applies an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (MRIO) approach to estimate the household carbon footprints for 12 different income groups in China's 30 regions. Subsequently, carbon footprint Gini coefficients are calculated to measure the carbon inequality for households across provinces. The findings of this study can support policy decisions on mitigating climate change and reducing inequality to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs).This study aims to provide information to help policymakers understand the interactions and trade-offs between measures targeting inequality, poverty, and climate change mitigation.

        <p>The data regarding the MRIO analyses on carbon emission inventory and China's MRIO All input-output tables are deflated to 2012 prices using the double-deflation method. China is one of the regions in the GTAP database, so we disaggregated the China-related sections in the GTAP model into 30-region and 30-sector tables according to our Chinese MRIO models. All households are divided into 5 rural income groups, including poor (20%), lower-middle (20%), middle (20%), upper-middle (20%), and rich (20%), and 7 urban income groups, including very poor (10%), poor (10%), lower-middle (20%), middle (20%), upper-middle (20%), rich (10%), and very rich (10%). Notably, the proportions for each income group are calculated based on household numbers rather than population. Household consumption is divided into eight major categories: food, clothing, residence, household facilities, transport, education, health care, and other. The data on household consumption for each income group are obtained from the provincial statistical yearbooks.The data regarding the MRIO analyses on carbon emission inventory and China's MRIO All input-output tables are deflated to 2012 prices using the double-deflation method.
