        <p>The Paris Agreement's temperature goals require global CO 2 emissions to halve by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. CO 2 capture and utilization (CCU) technologies are considered promising to achieve the temperature goals. This paper investigates which CCU technologies-using atmospheric, biogenic, or fossil CO 2are Paris compatible, based on life cycle emissions and technological maturity criteria. We systematically gathered and harmonized CCU technology information for both criteria and found that CCU with technology readiness levels (TRLs) of 6 or higher can be Paris compatible in 2030 for construction materials, enhanced oil recovery, horticulture industry, and some chemicals. For 2050, considering all TRLs, we showed that only products storing CO 2 permanently or produced from only zero-emissions energy can be Paris compatible. Our findings imply that research and policy should focus on accelerating development of CCU technologies that may achieve (close to) zero net emissions, avoiding lock-in by CCU technologies with limited net emission reductions.</p>
        <p>In the 2015 Paris Agreement, almost all of the world's nations committed to collectively hold ''the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels.'' 2 This is also known as the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal (LTTG). Climate change mitigation pathways with ''no or low overshoot'' of 1.5 C 3 are compatible with the Paris Agreement's LTTG [4][5][6][7] and characterized by two key numbers: in 2030, global net anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions are halved compared with 2020 emissions, and in 2050, net CO 2 emissions are zero. 3 This net zero CO 2 target implies that no sector can be excluded from deep emission reductions, that some technologies that still have significant emissions need to be phased out, and that a range of technologies is required to reach these emission reductions.</p>
        <p>Carbon (dioxide) capture and utilization (CCU) is among these options for potential emission reduction and is defined here as a process in which CO 2 is technologically captured from CO 2 point sources or ambient air and is subsequently used in or as a product. The reason why CCU could contribute to climate change mitigation is that it replaces fossil feedstocks, avoids upstream emissions, and temporarily keeps CO 2 out of the atmosphere until re-emitted in the use phase of the product. [8][9][10][11][12][13] CCU is distinguished from (permanent) carbon dioxide removal (CDR) of atmospheric CO 2 . The two terms only overlap when CO 2 in a CCU product has recently been removed from the atmosphere and is never re-emitted. 14 CCU appeals to policymakers and the general public because it is seen as part of the circular economy and a form of sustainable waste processing. 15 It also appeals to industry because CCU creates value from waste through CO 2 -based products 16,17 while avoiding the storage costs and concerns of geological storage of captured CO 2 , known as carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS). 18 However, the relevance of CCU in climate change mitigation is questioned in the literature, based on several concerns: (1) CCU products may not always substantially reduce emissions compared with their conventional counterparts that do not require the energy-intensive CO 2 capture and conversion steps; [19][20][21][22] (2) utilization of captured CO 2 , rather than permanent geological storage, may result in a higher global warming effects because utilized CO 2 is typically re-emitted when the CCU product is used or disposed of; 16,19 (3) CCU may not be economically feasible because of the high financial costs associated with the energy-intensive CO 2 capture and conversion steps; 19,23 and (4) CCU may form a political distraction from reducing CO 2 emissions, in particular when replacing CCS, because the scale at which CO 2 could be utilized is limited compared with the scale at which CO 2 could be stored geologically. 21 The goal of this review is to provide conceptual clarity on what CCU is and what can be expected from different CCU technological routes, in particular in reaching the Paris Agreement's LTTG. We first describe the different process steps and varieties of CCU technologies. Next, we present a framework to assess ''Paris compatibility'' in the context of CCU, using criteria based on technological maturity and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We then show the results of a systematic review of the CCU literature following this framework. Last, we discuss our findings and provide a research and policy outlook for climate change mitigation through CCU. For an overview of acronyms used, see Note S1.</p>
        <p>In line with our definition of CCU, we defined six key characteristics of CCU (Figure 1):</p>
        <p>(A) Sources of CO 2 . CO 2 can originate from fossil fuel or biomass combustion in power plants or industrial plants, from industrial processes such as the calcination reaction in cement production or biomass fermentation, or from the atmosphere directly using direct air capture (DAC). (B) Capture of CO 2 . CO 2 is captured technologically on an industrial scale by separating CO 2 from a bulk gas stream or the atmosphere using a solvent or sorbent, a membrane, cryogenics, or industrially cultivated organisms, such as microalgae, to photosynthesize CO 2 into biomass. (C) Utilization of CO 2 . CO 2 is used directly or indirectly by converting CO 2 into a range of products, often requiring electricity, heat, and/or catalysts. (D) CCU categories. The resulting CCU products can be categorized as direct uses, enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), mineral carbonates and construction materials, and fuels and chemicals.</p>
        <p>(E) Substitute. A CCU product is assumed to replace a product in the conventional economy with the same chemical structure, composition, or characteristics, typically produced from fossil fuels and referred to as the substitute. 24 (F) CCU lifetime. CO 2 is, depending on the CCU product, stored permanently or released into the atmosphere after a certain period of time, called its lifetime, ranging from days to centuries. For example, for fuels, the utilized CO 2 is emitted into the air upon combustion. For the purpose of this paper, we define storage as reaching permanency when it has a duration consistent with geological timescales: centuries or longer.</p>
        <p>Because we consider CCU for climate change mitigation, we exclude the use of CO 2 from natural reservoirs because this source of CO 2 does not reduce atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. 25 Our definition of CCU constrains CCU to processes that ''technologically capture CO 2 ,'' including industrial and engineered biological processes such as CO 2 capture from flue gases by microalgae, and excluding land-based CO 2 sequestration in biomass (in contrast to, for example, Detz and van der Zwaan 13 and Hepburn et al. 11 ). Use of biomass for energy and materials is therefore also not in the scope of this review.</p>
        <p>CCU is sometimes connected to CDR. CDR is a necessity to limit warming to 1.5 C 3 and has been defined as ''anthropogenic activities removing CO 2 from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products.'' 14 CDR includes methods like bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and direct air CCS (DACCS). 26 CCU can only be classified as CDR, following the criteria formulated by Tanzer and Ramı ´rez, 27 when (1) physical CO 2 is removed from atmosphere by capturing CO 2 directly from the air or capturing CO 2 from a biogenic source, (2) the CO 2 is stored permanently and not re-emitted to the atmosphere at a later point, and (3) the net quantity of CO 2 stored permanently through CCU is greater than the quantity of CO 2 emitted over the product's full life cycle, including use of the product and the emissions associated with the energy required for the CO 2 capture and conversion processes. When the criteria for CDR are not met but the life cycle emissions are lower than for the substituted product, CCU is considered a climate change mitigation measure. Avoided emissions compared with the substituted product may be presented as a negative number but should not be confused with physical removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere. 27 Capture of CO 2 CO 2 capture from a point source CO 2 is typically captured from a point source, such as flue gas streams at power plants or industrial plants, or from industrial processes where CO 2 is produced as a by-product. Capturing CO 2 from a bulk gas stream entails separating the CO 2 from the rest of the stream. Sometimes CO 2 separation is already required in the primary production process; for example, in ammonia synthesis, natural gas processing, and biogas upgrading to biomethane. 28 This leads to a high-purity stream of CO 2 along with the primary product. Depending on the concentration and components present in a gas stream, one of three main separation processes may be most suitable 29 : (1) absorption of CO 2 in a liquid solvent, (2) adsorption of CO 2 onto a solid, and (3) using a membrane to separate CO 2 through selective permeability. 30 In CO 2 absorption processes using amine-based solvents like monoethanolamine, CO 2 is chemically bound, and then the CO 2 is stripped to allow the solvent to absorb CO 2 again in the next cycle. This is called regeneration of the solvent and requires heat. Besides single-amine absorption, amine blends are in development where amines are combined for complementary characteristics. An integrated CCU process has also been proposed to reduce the overall energy demand, absorbing CO 2 from raw natural gas in methanol, after which conversion takes place. 31 Other developments include ionic liquids, which are liquids composed entirely of ions with a melting point of less than 100 C. 32 Physical adsorption research has focused on improving the adsorbents as well as the adsorption processes of regeneration. 32 Alternatives, like high-temperature solid adsorption of CO 2 , require less energy input for regeneration compared with low-temperature liquid absorption. [33][34][35] Use of membranes for CO 2 separation is based on creating configurations especially for CO 2 selectivity from polymer or ceramic materials. 33 Other emerging CO 2 capture technologies are high-temperature solid looping systems: calcium carbonate looping, where calcium oxide is used as a sorbent that binds CO 2 to form limestone, and chemical looping combustion, where a metal oxide is used to separate CO 2 from other components in the flue gas, foregoing the need for gas separation, followed by an exothermic metal oxide regeneration reaction. 32,36 Cryogenic systems are based on the differences in the temperature and pressure at which constituent gases in flue gas become liquid, removing CO 2 from the bulk stream by cooling and condensation. 33 CO 2 from a point source can also be captured photosynthetically or electrosynthetically into biomass by living organisms: 15,37 microalgae are cultivated at CO 2 concentrations of 5%-20%, making flue gas a suitable source, and have a conversion efficiency of solar energy into chemical energy higher than that of terrestrial plants (3%-8% instead of 0.5%). 38 Co-location of the facility at the site of the point source is important to avoid the need for transporting flue gas. 39 Other options for biofixation include microorganisms such as acetogenic bacteria 40 or anaerobic CO 2sequestering bacteria. 38 CO 2 capture from ambient air DAC of CO 2 can be performed using a range of separation processes. Because atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (approximately 400 ppm) are 100-300 times lower than for point sources, energy requirements, and therefore costs, for DAC are substantially larger than for point source capture. 41,42 Expert elicitation leads to expected cost declines to around 200 US dollars (USD) per ton of CO 2 captured by 2050, 43 still higher than the 15-35 USD per ton of CO 2 captured for high-purity point sources and 60-120 USD per ton of CO 2 captured for lower-purity point sources; e.g., steel or cement production. 17,44 An exception would be when lower-purity CO 2 streams are sufficient, such as for microalgae. 45 The two main categories of DAC methods are based on (1) amine-functionalized solid sorbents, which require regeneration at low temperatures or via moisturizing, 46 and (2) alkaline hydroxide capture solutions, which require high-temperature solvent regeneration. 47 Less energy-intensive regeneration processes are under development, including electrochemical regeneration 48 and bipolar membrane electrodialysis. 49 Utilization of CO 2 Direct uses of CO 2 CO 2 can be used directly, without conversion, in several sectors. In horticultural production, elevating CO 2 concentrations in greenhouses increases crop yields by approximately 50%. 50 This process is called CO 2 enrichment and is traditionally achieved by combustion of fossil fuels such as diesel 50 or natural gas, 51 which has the dual purpose of greenhouse heating. Because more CO 2 is required to reach the desired CO 2 concentration than is produced for heat, captured CO 2 can be used. 50 CO 2 can also be used directly as a refrigerant for supermarket applications, replacing hydrofluorocarbons with higher global warming potentials, 52 reducing risks of leakage and associated global warming effects. 53 CO 2 can also be used as a carbonating agent in sugar production and soft drinks, as a solvent for extraction of flavors, in the decaffeination process, as dry ice, in fire extinguishers, and in the pharmaceutical industry as a respiratory stimulant. 16,21,54 EHR Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a method where CO 2 is injected into the subsurface to recover oil from almost depleted reservoirs. EOR is a mature technology that has been practiced commercially for decades, starting in the early 1970s in North America. 25 Similarly, CO 2 can be used to recover natural gas from coalbeds (enhanced coalbed methane [ECBM]), although there are currently no active ECBM projects. 55 Although the source of CO 2 for EHR is typically natural CO 2 reservoirs (not part of our definition of CCU), EHR can also be performed with CO 2 captured from point sources or DAC. 45 Mineral carbonates and construction materials Mineral carbonation is a process where CO 2 reacts with magnesium or calcium oxides, -hydroxides, or -silicates in an exothermic reaction, forming stable carbonate products; 56 examples of magnesium-or calcium-rich materials are mined minerals 57 or industrial residues such as slag from steel production, 58,59 red gypsum, 60 fly ash, 61,62 or desalination brines. 63 These processes can be categorized into direct or indirect carbonation processes. 59 In the direct carbonation process, a gas-solid reaction takes place between CO 2 and the ground minerals. The produced carbonates can be used in concrete, asphalt, and other construction practices. 64 In the indirect carbonation process, magnesium or calcium ions are first extracted in an alkaline solution, and then they react with CO 2 to form precipitated magnesium carbonate (PMC), 63 precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) 59 or nano-calcium carbonate (NCC). 65 These carbonates can be used as a pigment or filler material in production of paper, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. 66 CO 2 can be used to cure concrete, absorbing CO 2 instead of steam in the hardening process. Steam-cured concrete normally re-absorbs roughly 30% of its production's CO 2 emissions during its lifetime, 67,68 so emissions are not reduced by CO 2 -accelerated curing in itself. Instead, the reduction is achieved because of the lower steam requirement 69 and the improvements in mechanical properties, reducing the amount of cement required, [70][71][72] in a similar way as addition of ''cementitious'' materials like carbonated minerals reduces the need for cement in concrete. 61,73 Other options under development include production of carbon nanomaterials like graphene, 74 nanofibers, or nanotubes from CO 2 , 75 which can be used in construction, reducing energy and material demand in the manufacturing process. 76 Fuels and chemicals Fuels and chemicals directly based on fossil fuels or fossil feedstocks are energy-dense products. Therefore, producing these chemicals or fuels from CO 2 often requires an energy-intensive conversion process at high pressure and/or increased temperature, supported by catalysts, because CO 2 is an inert and thermodynamically stable molecule. Conversion processes include thermochemical, electrochemical, and photocatalytic conversion.</p>
        <p>In thermochemical conversion (sometimes referred to as ''hydrogenation''), CO 2 and H 2 are prepared separately and subsequently combined. 77 The hydrogen supplies part of the energy needed for the CO 2 conversion process. This process allows production of chemicals and fuels that would otherwise be of fossil origin, like methane or methanol. 12 Methanol, in turn, can serve as a feedstock for production of other chemicals and fuels, such as ethylene, 78 polyols, 79 and dimethyl ether (DME). 80 Methane production can be a method for long-term storage of renewable energy from intermittent electricity, producing H 2 with water electrolysis, followed by CO 2 hydrogenation to methane (Sabatier reaction) and methane combustion for power generation at a later time (power-methane-power). 81 Another key hydrogenation process is synthesis of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, which consists of synthesis gas (syngas) production via conversion of CO 2 to carbon monoxide (CO) in the reverse wa-ter-gas shift (rWGS) reaction and mixing it with H 2 or via steam methane reforming (SMR) and, finally, using the Fischer-Tropsch process to create hydrocarbon chains. 82 The stoichiometric ratio of H 2 to CO in syngas can be adjusted to the targeted end products, as occurs currently via the WGS reaction in conventional syngas-based processes. 83 In photocatalytic conversion, CO 2 is converted to, for example, methane or methanol using sunlight, water, and dyesensitized semiconductors. 84 Electrochemical reduction, where CO 2 is reduced at atmospheric temperature using electricity, 85 can be used to produce, for example, ethanol, 12 methanol, 86,87 dimethyl carbonate (DMC), 20 formate, 88 or formic acid. 85 When CO 2 is captured by microalgae, the microalgae can be converted into fuels or chemicals; e.g., via transesterification or hydrogenation of algal oil 89,90 or hydrothermal liquefaction. 91 Microalgae may also be used as fish food 92 or food. 93</p>
        <p>In this paper, a CCU technology is classified as Paris compatible when its deployment is expected to be in line with reaching the Paris Agreement' LTTG and corresponding 1.5 C mitigation pathway. This definition results in two questions to assess Paris compatibility: (1) is the CCU technology ready on time and (2) does the CCU technology sufficiently reduce CO 2 emissions? These questions result in the Paris compatibility criteria for 2030 and 2050 outlined in this section (Figure 2). The following two sections present a review of the literature underlying the criteria and explain how these criteria can be applied to CCU technologies.</p>
        <p>Technological maturing, the process leading from research and development (R&amp;D) to demonstration trials, early market formation, and widespread diffusion, can span several decades and is ridden with financial risks and technological uncertainties. 94 We include technological maturity as a criterion for Paris compatibility because for a technology to be able to contribute to emission reductions in 2030 or 2050, it must be developed sufficiently to be ready for widespread diffusion.</p>
        <p>The technological readiness level (TRL) of a technology is an indication of the maturity of a technology on a scale that summarizes detailed information on technological maturity into a single value. 95 The scale has nine levels, spanning from basic concept (TRL 1) to successful, real-life operation (TRL 9). TRL 6 presents a turning point in technological development by requiring an operational system at a relevant scale. The time it takes to progress through the TRL scale differs per technology and is context dependent, but for CCU technologies, 10-15 years is typically assumed to be needed to progress from lab scale to full-scale implementation. 9,96,97 In line with Chauvy et al., 9 we assume that, for a CCU technology to be ready in 2030, it must be in at least TRL 6 in 2020. Given that it is possible to progress from the R&amp;D phase (TRL 1-3) to real-life operation (TRL 9) in 20-30 years, 9,98 the TRL is no impediment for a CCU technology for 2050. This does not mean that it can be assumed that a technology in the R&amp;D phase in 2020 will be ready in 2050, only that a technology cannot be excluded from Paris compatibility in 2050 based on its 2020 TRL. Emissions criteria 1.5 C-pathways are characterized by two key numbers: in 2030, global net CO 2 emissions are halved compared with 2020 emissions, and in 2050, net CO 2 emissions are zero. 3 For CO 2 emission reductions to be in line with 1.5 C pathways, the CCU technology must halve CO 2 emissions associated with production and use of the CCU product by 2030 compared with the emissions associated with the current conventional, substituted product. In 2050, CO 2 emissions associated with the CCU product must be zero to be Paris compatible. Although emission data are often provided for a basket of greenhouse gases (GHGs) instead of CO 2 only, CCU is focused on reducing CO 2 emissions, which is by far the most prominent contributor to total GHG emissions, directly as well as indirectly. 99,100</p>
        <p>The TRL scale has its origin at the American National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the 1970s and became more widely known when the US Department of Defense started using it to improve its technology R&amp;D outcomes. 101 It was first comprehensively described by Mankins, 95 and has since received recognition in policy-making, industry, and academia. 102 For example, in 2010, the European Commission advised projects that received European Union (EU) funding to use TRLs for identification of technological maturity. 103 Its use has also been recommended specifically for CCU techno-economic assessments. 24,104 The European Commission defines TRLs in a generalized way to allow comparability of technologies in different fields, including energy and climate technologies (Table 1). 105 A downside of a generalized scale is the general description for each level, including criteria that may not be applicable or not specific enough to achieve unambiguous TRL ratings. 102,106 Adaptations to the generalized scale were developed to better rate technologies in a certain field; for example, in the chemical industry 102 and even for CCU technologies 9 (Table 1). Despite the differences between descriptions of TRLs, the commonality is that TRL 6 represents a break from the foregoing TRLs by requiring an operational system at a relevant scale (pilot plant) to have been developed.</p>
        <p>To assess whether a CCU technology fulfills the Paris compatibility maturity criteria, its TRL in 2020 must be determined from direct TRL specifications or by applying the milestones as defined by Buchner et al. 102 (Table 1) to descriptions of the technology's state of development. Table 1 includes examples of CCU technologies for each TRL, and Note S2 provides a comprehensive overview of TRL ratings of CCU technologies. Some studies report ranges instead of a single TRL for a CCU technology. This can be done for three reasons: (1) the technology is a ''composed'' technology made up of multiple processes, each with its individual TRL. Hence, the range of these individual TRLs is reported; (2) more than one technology is in development to produce a CO 2based product, and the full range is reported for this product instead of for each production process separately; or (3) there is uncertainty because of a lack of data. In this paper, we deal with these ranges in TRL in the following way: in the case of a composed technology (reason 1), the lowest TRL is counted as the overall TRL because it is the weakest link in the chain in the process to commercialization. 102 We specify a TRL for each CCU production process rather than only per CCU product (reason 2). Uncertainty in the TRL is resolved by comparing reported process descriptions (e.g., proof of concept, bench-scale process, pilot plant) with the descriptions of Buchner et al. 102 to find the best match (reason 3), as explained in Note S2.</p>
        <p>To assess the Paris compatibility of CCU technologies, we determined the GHG emission intensity of CCU products (kgCO 2equiv/kg CO 2 utilized) and of substituted conventional products (assuming 1:1 replacement) based on a literature search of life S3, which also provides an overview of the specific CO 2 sources and CO 2 capture processes covered). These studies were harmonized regarding (1) functional unit, (2) system boundaries, (3) electricity mix, (4) hydrogen production, (5) dealing with multifunctionality, and (6) accounting of temporary carbon storage, as detailed below. For the substituted products, we followed the choices made in the original papers, assuming the CCU product replaces a product with identical molecular structure or, if this does not exist, a product with the same characteristics and function. 24</p>
        <p>The functional unit of CCU products can be end product-based (e.g., kg or MJ product) or input-based (e.g., kg CO 2 utilized).</p>
        <p>Most CCU LCA studies use an end product-based functional unit, which allows estimating absolute emission reductions when switching to a CCU product. However, to be able to compare different CCU technologies, the functional unit should be the same and, thus, input based. 12,123 We therefore use 1 kg of CO 2 utilized as functional unit in this paper. It is possible to go from an end product-based functional unit to the functional unit of 1 kg of CO 2 utilized by determining the product's GHG intensity in kgCO 2 -equiv/kg product and multiplying it by kg product/kg CO 2 utilized.</p>
        <p>Most LCA studies quantify ''cradle-to-factory-gate'' emissions, assuming that emissions beyond the gate are the same for CCU product and substitute. In our analysis, we determine the absolute CO 2 emissions of a CCU product and the percentual CO 2 emission reduction of a CCU product relative to its substitute. This requires a wider ''cradle-to-grave'' approach that includes end-of-life emissions for both products. In practice, however, data on transport and use-phase emissions often lack in the reviewed LCA studies, except for re-emission of CO 2 upon combustion or dissolution. So where cradle-to-grave data were not available, we used cradle-to-factory-gate emissions and added end-of-life emissions, as proposed by Ferna ´ndez-Dacosta et al., 23 assuming that use-phase emissions were negligible. Combustion and dissolution were then included in the end-of-life emissions. We did not harmonize production infrastructure and transport emissions and follow the choices in the respective LCAs because these emissions contribute negligibly to the total GHG intensity. [124][125][126] For the substituted products, emissions were also determined based on a cradleto-grave basis.</p>
        <p>To improve inter-comparability of CCU products and take into account the expected decarbonization of the electricity sector, 127 we harmonized the GHG intensity of electricity used in all foreground processes of the studies considered. This includes electricity use in the capture and conversion process and hydrogen production via electrolysis. The harmonized GHG intensity of electricity was set to be in line with emissions pathways limiting global warming to 1.5 C: 3 0.17 kgCO 2 /kWh for 2030 and 0 kgCO 2 /kWh for 2050. For zero-emissions electricity, it is assumed that the (limited) emissions of renewable electricity production are compensated by CDR (e.g., from bioenergy with CCS).</p>
        <p>Hydrogen is an important feedstock in the production of fuels and chemicals from CO 2 and is produced using fossil fuels with or without CCS or water electrolysis. Because we assume hydrogen production to decarbonize in Paris-compatible pathways, we harmonize all studies toward electrolysis-based hydrogen following their reported electricity requirements, unless H 2 is co-produced in the conversion process. For an electricity requirement of 52 kWh/kg H 2 and using the aforementioned electricity carbon intensities for 2030 and 2050, electrolysis-based hydrogen results in 6.85 kgCO 2 -equiv/kg H 2 in 2030 and 0 kgCO 2 -equiv/kg H 2 in 2050. We use the substitution approach to deal with the co-produced O 2 (experimental procedures).</p>
        <p>The CCU production chain is typically inherently multifunctional; an industrial facility or power plant produces a primary product (e.g., steel or electricity) as well as CO 2 , which is used as feedstock in the secondary CCU process. GHG emissions of this system must be divided between the primary product and the secondary CCU product. DAC-based CCU systems are not multifunctional because there is no primary product. We apply system expansion via a substitution approach to solve this multifunctionality problem following the LCA standard ISO 14044 and LCA guidelines for CCU 104 (Figure 3). System expansion via substitution assumes that a primary production plant with CCU directly substitutes an identical plant without CCU to ultimately determine the emissions that can be associated with CCU itself. It is formalized as shown in Equation 1(for a full derivation, see experimental procedures):</p>
        <p>(Equation 1)</p>
        <p>where E stands for GHG emissions (in kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CO 2 utilized), specifically E CCU GHG emissions of the CCU product; E utilized CO 2 utilized in production of the CCU product; E capture process GHG emissions associated with capturing CO 2 and separating CO 2 from the bulk gas stream; E conversion GHG emissions of the conversion process of CO 2 into the end product; E other other (remaining) GHG emissions associated with the CCU product, such as GHG emissions at end of life other than release of utilized CO 2 (for example, from fossil feedstock added in the conversion process); and E released GHG emissions of utilized CO 2 to the atmosphere at the end of life of the CCU product.</p>
        <p>In most cases, E utilized and E released cancel each other out. However, E released is less than E utilized when some of the utilized CO 2 is lost in the conversion process (i.e., included in E conversion ) or when the CO 2 is stored permanently; then E released is zero. A negative value for E CCU can occur when CO 2 is stored permanently and the amount of CO 2 utilized is greater than the combined emissions of the CCU production, use, and end-of-life processes.</p>
        <p>The interpretation of a negative value for E CCU depends on the source of CO 2 . In the case of CO 2 with a fossil origin, a negative E CCU means that the total GHG emissions of the system with CCU are reduced in comparison with the system without CCU and that this emission reduction can be attributed to CCU. It does not mean that CCU is CDR because CO 2 is not removed from the atmosphere. 27,128 In the case of CO 2 that is removed from the atmosphere, directly (through DAC) or indirectly (through capture of CO 2 with biogenic origin), a negative value for E CCU does mean that CDR takes place. For biogenic CO 2 , CDR would also require sustainable sourcing of the biomass used.</p>
        <p>The substitution approach is based on the assumption that a point source without capture is 1:1 substituted by the same plant with capture. In the near future (i.e., 2030), this assumption holds because many plants without capture can still be substituted. In the long run, however, the reference system is expected to transform toward a zero-emissions economy. Therefore, in a Paris-compatible 2050 system, we can no longer assume that there are unabated fossil point sources to substitute and associated emissions to avoid. Because emissions are no longer unabated, considering CCU as an option to abate fossil CO 2 emissions means that the responsibility for not emitting shifts to CCU. In terms of calculating the GHG intensity of CCU for a fossil CO 2 source in 2050, this (A and B) In the system expansion via substitution approach, the GHG intensity of the CCU product E CCU is determined by the difference between the emissions of (A) the multifunctional system and (B) the marginal production system of the primary product.</p>
        <p>means that all emissions from the stack onward are assigned to the CCU product: 2)</p>
        <p>where E stands for GHG emissions (in kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CO 2 utilized), specifically E CCUðfossil in 2050Þ GHG emissions of the CCU product (for 2050 in a Paris-compatible scenario where substitution of unabated fossil CO 2 point sources cannot be assumed) and E capture losses CO 2 not captured in the capture process, assuming a capture rate of 95%. 32,81,122 In the results, we report E CCU , but when this applies to fossil CO 2 sources in 2050, Equation 2 is used for the calculation. For CCU processes based on biogenic or atmospheric CO 2 in 2050, Equation 1 still applies because availability of these sources in 2050 is in line with a Paris-compatible scenario.</p>
        <p>The importance of a product's lifetime for CCU's contribution to climate change mitigation has been stressed in the literature. 26,129 Temporary storage of CO 2 by lowering atmospheric CO 2 concentrations for the duration of the product's lifetime decreases radiative forcing over this period of time. 130 We calculated the GHG intensity of CCU products without (base case) and with the benefit of temporary carbon storage (sensitivity analysis) using a time horizon of 100 years. Global warming potentials are used for this calculation, adjusted for temporary carbon storage (global warming potential [GWP] storage ). Global warming potentials describe the contribution to radiative forcing of delayed CO 2 emissions compared with direct CO 2 emissions over 100 years. We derived the GWP storage -100 factors using the method described by Guest et al., 131 which is based on Clift and Brandao, 132 combined with the more recent atmospheric CO 2 decay curves described by Joos et al. 133 The factors depend on the lifetime of the CCU product, as shown in Table 2; see the experimental procedures for an overview of CCU lifetimes. To include the storage effect, E released in Equations 1 and 2 is multiplied by GWP storage -100. In this way, only captured CO 2 is affected by this temporary storage benefit, not fossil carbon added in some CCU routes as additional feedstock.</p>
        <p>Figure 4 shows the relative GHG intensity of CCU technologies in 2030 plotted against their 2020 TRL. As explained above, a negative GHG intensity ratio means that an emissions reduction takes place for fossil CO 2 and CDR when the source of CO 2 is biogenic or atmospheric. CCU technologies fulfilling the 2030 emissions criterion can be characterized by one or more of the following attributes: (1) preventing (high) capture emissions, (2) preventing (high) conversion emissions, (3) preventing re-emission of CO 2 , and (4) replacing an emission-intensive process.</p>
        <p>Paris-compatible CCU technologies in 2030 are CO 2 enrichment in the horticulture industry 50 with CO 2 from a co-located biogas to biomethane upgrading unit, which is considered a by-product (i.e., is characterized by attribute 1) and can be used directly (attribute 2). In the carbonation process of steel slag to produce construction blocks, flue gas is used directly, 58 omitting the capture step (1). CO 2 is stored permanently through an exothermic carbonation reaction 134 (2 and 3). In EOR, CO 2 is used directly (2) and can be Paris compatible for several gas separation methods [135][136][137] as long as no more than 2 barrels of oil (bbl) are recovered per ton CO 2 injected. This allows a favorable balance of the CO 2 released upon combustion of the recovered oil and the CO 2 stored permanently (3). Urea production from basic oxygen furnace gas (BOFG) uses waste heat from the steel plant for capture and conversion processes (1 and 2) and replaces electricity production from BOFG. 113 Hence, quantification of the GHG intensity of urea includes replacement of electricity produced from BOFG by the 1.5 C-compatible electricity mix (4). Last, close to halving emissions is CO via rWGS with relatively low conversion emissions (2). 12 Low TRL CCU technologies that only fulfill the emissions criterion can be characterized by the same four attributes. The sodium bicarbonate process uses flue gas directly, avoiding the capture step (attribute 1). 138 Indirect mineral carbonation reactions producing PMC or PPC may have low emissions for high efficiency of the alkaline absorption process, depending on process development. They store CO 2 permanently (3). 63 Formic acid via hydrogenation reduces emissions sufficiently compared with the emission-intensive substitute (4). 12 Electrochemical production of formic acid via supercritical CO 2 139 and methane and methanol via photocatalytic conversion 84 have low conversion emissions (2) because they do not require electricity-intensive hydrogen.</p>
        <p>High TRL CCU technologies not fulfilling the emissions criterion can also be characterized by the aforementioned attributes. However, here, these are the reasons for not fulfilling the emissions criterion. CO 2 curing of concrete 72,140 does not sufficiently reduce emissions because of the emissions associated with cement production (2). Fuels and chemicals based on thermochemical conversion typically have high conversion emissions because of electricity-intensive hydrogen production (2). Finally, EOR with a recovery ratio over 2 bbl per ton of CO 2 injected does not store a sufficient volume of CO 2 compared with combustion emissions 141,142 (3). Benefits of temporary CO 2 storage Some products store CO 2 for several decades; e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene. Adding the temporary storage benefit based on a lifetime of 50 years leads to a reduced GHG intensity of roughly 25%. This, however, is not enough to lead to a difference in Paris compatibility. For long-lived polyols, the reduction is only a few percent because a large share of the embodied carbon is from fossil feedstock, to which the storage factor does not apply. The lifetime of the other chemicals and fuels is assumed to be 6 months, where the GWP storage -100 factor of 0.99 does not affect Paris compatibility. For EHR, construction materials, and most mineral carbonates, permanent storage was already assumed in the base case.</p>
        <p>Figure 5 shows the GHG intensity of CCU products in 2050 (E CCU , in kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CO 2 utilized) (Equations 1 and 2). In 2050, low low-TRL technologies may be Paris compatible. The characteristics of CCU technologies fulfilling the 2050 emissions criterion are simplified to (1) preventing re-emission of CO 2 , (2) only using zero-emissions energy, and (3) utilizing CO 2 recently removed from the atmosphere (biogenic/atmospheric). Construction blocks from carbonation of steel slag using a purified stream of biogenic CO 2 134 are Paris compatible, resulting in CDR because the CO 2 is stored permanently (i.e., criteria 1 and 3 are fulfilled). In addition, steel slag carbonation using fossil flue gas directly to produce cementitious material 58 achieves close to zero emissions because no capture process is required, the carbonation process is exothermic, and the CO 2 is stored permanently (fulfilling criteria 1 and 2). Because CO 2 is not stored permanently in fuels or chemicals, these products can only be strictly Paris compatible when the CO 2 is of biogenic or atmospheric origin and zero emissions are associated with the capture and conversion processes (fulfilling criteria 2 and 3). This situation is approached when heat integration is applied, electric heat is used, or simply only electricity is required. Processes approaching zero emissions are methane production from H 2 and biogenic CO 2 ; 143 DMM via condensation with formaldehyde or via direct synthesis, both for a biogenic source; 144 and Fischer-Tropsch fuels from atmospheric CO 2 , based on a fully electric process for capture and conversion. 145 The assumption of zero-emission electricity is crucial because the GHG intensity of these options using the 2030 electricity mix is between 1.21 and 1.39 kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CO 2 utilized (see Figure S1 for the absolute GHG intensity of CCU products in 2030).</p>
        <p>Inclusion of the benefit of temporary storage of 6 months is enough to obtain a negative absolute GHG intensity for DMM via condensation with formaldehyde or via direct synthesis, both for a biogenic source. 144</p>
        <p>We considered technological maturity in terms of TRLs of individual technologies because data are available for individual technologies. Others have suggested ''system readiness levels'' 146,147 to reflect the technology's need to embed in a certain system. Because of this embedding, assessment of technological readiness at a systemic level could lead to lower levels of maturity. This means that Paris compatibility of CCU could be overestimated. On the other hand, concerted, transdisciplinary action on innovation could speed up technological maturing of promising technologies. For example, this could apply to sodium bicarbonate, which fulfills the emission reduction criterion but is in TRL 5. As a next step, ''technological innovation system'' analyses 148,149 can be performed to provide information on what actors can do to advance such technologies.</p>
        <p>Our harmonization allowed a comparison of CCU technologies, but some uncertainty in future emissions remains because (1) LCAs of low-TRL technologies may be based idealized modeling data, underestimating the environmental effects because of an information bias; 108 (2) the environ- mental effect of technologies is expected to decrease as they mature because of energy efficiency improvements and/or development of catalysts for more efficient conversion; 139,127 (3) some CCU processes could be adapted so that more CO 2 is utilized per product produced (for example, for EOR); 150 and (4) if product lifetimes could be extended, then they could, based on the temporary storage benefit, decrease their contribution to climate change. Future LCA studies could focus on CCU technologies that are developing quickly and for which no LCAs are available or for which only LCAs based on low-TRL data are available or on how CCU processes can be adapted to reduce overall emissions.</p>
        <p>Even when the emissions criteria are not fulfilled, it is possible that there are no future alternative technological routes that provide the same product at a lower GHG intensity. Although a CCU technology is not strictly Paris compatible in such cases, CCU could still play a role in the overall energy system transition. In addition, if other environmental effects besides climate are included in the equation, then CCU options may, in certain cases, be viewed more positively than remaining alternatives to our fossil fuel-based production system. For instance, CCU products do not have the land-use effects of crop-based biomaterials (including biodiversity). 151 Further research could include alternative routes for the assessment and define emission reduction criteria per product group. The assessment of emission reduction could be extended beyond the technology level to the sector or even the system level. Determining the global climate change mitigation potential of CCU at scale requires that interactions with other mitigation options as well as broader changes in the economy are considered, which may be achieved using integrated assessment models. Further research could focus on including CCU in these models and determining how much each CCU technology could contribute at scale to CO 2 emission reductions within and across different sectors.</p>
        <p>The multifunctionality problem is one that needs to be solved carefully and transparently. Otherwise, it is possible to end up with statements that cannot be simultaneously true, such as the following: CCU can make traditionally CO 2 -emitting industries (e.g., fossil fuel electricity generation, chemicals, cement) carbon-neutral 10,75 while producing carbon-neutral CCU products. 78,152 The reality is that the eventual emission of CO 2 must be accounted for by one of the processes. And, as shown above, when moving to a future without unabated fossil emissions, this emission has to be allocated to CCU. The right year of this allocation shift is unclear and may depend on the GHG reduction targets of a specific country, sector, or company. Although we consider the year 2050, based on Paris-compatible emission pathways at a global level, other countries or firms may have reasons to select a different point in time where fossil points sources can no longer go unabated.</p>
        <p>The carbon intensity of electricity of 0.17 kgCO 2 /kWh that we used for 2030 is higher than the carbon intensity in many of the CCU LCA studies; for example, when based on only renewables. This means that, in these cases, we found a higher 2030 GHG intensity of CCU products compared with the original studies. Still, our 2030 carbon intensity of electricity may be an underestimation because it was based on emission pathways that only include use-phase emissions, not upstream emissions. Our 2030 results, however, are not sensitive to this increase in carbon intensity; doubling the carbon intensity (0.34 kgCO 2 /kWh) did not affect Paris compatibility of technologies in 2030. However, storing renewable electricity in a fuel or chemical results in a loss of primary energy 153 and has a low energy return on energy invested. 21 Hence, use of low-carbon electricity for mitigation options other than CCU has been shown to achieve higher emission reductions per kWh; e.g., for e-mobility and heat pumps 10 or DACCS. 154 Alternatively, CCU technologies have been proposed to use excess renewable electricity and aid the energy transition by balancing the peaks of renewable power production. 155,156 This suggestion is sobered by its limited economic attractiveness as a result of the low-capacity factors, 81 but further research on the systemic effects of electrification of the CCU process would be of value.</p>
        <p>The only CCU technologies that are 2030 and 2050 Paris compatible are construction materials based on carbonation of steel slag, either using fossil flue gas directly or using CO 2 captured from a biogenic source. Arguably, implementing CCU options that only reduce emissions sufficiently for 2030 but not for 2050 could lead to a carbon lock-in, which would occur when large investments are made in 2030, complicating phase-out and discouraging necessary transitions later on. 157,158 Hence, assuming that a CCU production plant built in 2030 is still operational in 2050 would mean that the 2050 emissions criterion should be added to assess 2030 Paris compatibility. In that case, with the exception of some construction materials, none of the 2030-compatible options fulfill the 2050 emissions criterion. A lock-in in these CCU processes could be prevented by implementing an exit strategy for industries relying on CCU processes that are only 2030 compatible. CCU technologies that are currently used or considered and that are not 2030 compatible could lead to a lock-in within years. We recommend that these are critically evaluated regarding their potential for a short-term exit strategy.</p>
        <p>We found that energy requirements for CO 2 capture and their associated emissions differ between specific CO 2 sources and capture processes, in line with M€ uller et al. 128 and von der Assen et al. 159 Whether a CCU process is Paris compatible can thus depend on the capture process itself (e.g., a DAC process based on natural gas 143 rather than renewable electricity 145 may render the entire CCU product non-Paris compatible). Our research has focused on available CO 2 source-CCU technology combinations in the LCA literature, and further research could harmonize CO 2 sources and capture processes to provide additional insights into remaining CO 2 source-CCU technology combinations. This would allow including more innovative CO 2 capture routes and identifying more environmentally optimal combinations of capture processes and conversion processes for different CO 2 sources.</p>
        <p>Cue ´llar-Franca and Azapagic 16 showed that, per ton of CO 2 captured, CCS results in lower emissions than CCU. Although capture emissions are the same, emissions for compression and injection of CO 2 in geological formations are lower than most CCU technologies' emissions from conversion and ultimate release of CO 2 . Based on this, only CCU technologies with low conversion emissions and permanent storage could compete with CCS. Although the avoided emissions of the product that CCU replaces are not taken into account, 16 including these could still lead to the same conclusion, as shown for methanol. 19 To deal with residual flows containing CO 2 from essential industries as long as they exist, further research could focus on systematic comparison of CCS and CCU technologies in light of their product-specific substitutes 123 and TRLs.</p>
        <p>By combining the literature on technological maturity of CCU with the global emission reduction requirements consistent with the Paris Agreement, we conclude that only very few CCU options would be Paris compatible. Moreover, some CCU options only meet the criteria in the short run and could lead to a lock-in toward 2050. We find that, for a CCU technology to be Paris compatible in 2030, it has to have low GHG emissions from CO 2 capture and conversion, replace a GHG-intensive substitute, and (in most cases) lead to permanent storage. For 2050, the criteria become more stringent, and Paris compatibility typically depends on a combination of no capture and conversion emissions (e.g., by using zero-emission electricity or waste heat), permanent storage, and use of biogenic or atmospheric CO 2 sources. Achieving CDR via CCU technologies is only possible when biogenic or atmospheric CO 2 is used and stored permanently.</p>
        <p>Although our conclusions are robust as a result of the harmonization approach we adopted, we also showed that determining the CO 2 emission reduction associated with a CCU technology depends on a range of assumptions. When designing policies for implementation of CCU technologies, clear guidelines for these assumptions must be in place. We recommend using a future electricity mix and considering the full life cycle, including possible re-emission of CO 2 . To clarify the emission reduction potential of CCU, it should also be made very clear against what CCU is compared. We distinguish three benchmarks: (1) emission reduction of CCU compared with emitting CO 2 at the point source, (2) emission reduction of CCU compared with the substituted original product, and (3) emission reduction of CCU compared with other alternative technological routes replacing the original product. This study's assessment of the Paris compatibility of CCU was based on the first two benchmarks, but the third could shed light on the potential trade-offs between CCU and other options for replacing fossil-based production, which may change the verdict on CO 2 source-CCU options close to the Paris compatibility emission frontier.</p>
        <p>Our findings have implications for climate and innovation policy. Research funding may currently be allocated to CCU options that are unlikely to be mature in time for the Paris temperature limits or that are not able to sufficiently reduce emissions. To be in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, such funding would have to be redirected to mitigation options consistent with the Paris Agreement and unlikely to result in carbon lock-in. CCU encompasses a wide range of technologies with different conversion processes, product lifetimes, and substituted products. Therefore, we recommend that decision-makers recognize this diversity in CCU, base their decisions on the share of emissions an individual CCU technology can reduce, and whether (close to) zero emissions or CDR can be achieved rather than treating CCU as a homogeneous technology. In addition, the technology's current level of maturity and when it is expected to be ready for diffusion should be considered. Such a focus could facilitate creation of strategies that accelerate development of technologies with low TRLs that may lead to (close to) zero emissions or CDR.</p>

        <p>For identification of a Paris-compatible mitigation pathway, we used data available from the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) 1.5 C Scenario Explorer and Data. 1 The full dataset (Data S1) with harmonized emissions of CCU technologies for 2030 and 2050 and source data for Figures 4,5, and S1 have been deposited at Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) under https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-28h-n6zj.</p>
        <p>We use all ''no-overshoot'' and ''low-overshoot'' 1.5 C pathways as defined in the IAMC 1.5 C Scenario Explorer and Data 1 (version 1.1). We take the mean of the global annual emissions in these pathways from 2010-2060 to arrive at the Paris-compatible mitigation pathway in Figure 2. ''Half of 2020 emissions'' in Figure 2 is found by multiplying the mean 2020 emissions in these pathways by 0.5.</p>
        <p>To assess Paris compatibility of CCU technologies, we determined the GHG emission intensity of CCU products (kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CO 2 utilized) and of substituted conventional products (assuming 1:1 replacement) based on a literature search of life cycle assessment studies on CCU. The

        </p>
        <p>On November 30, 2020, this search string led to 1,041 results. After screening these papers for relevance (1) fulfilling our definition of CCU, (2) determining the GWP and not only LCA endpoints, and (3) including emissions from energy use and excluding conference proceedings and reviews and meta-analyses without original data, 106 studies remained (Note S3). Microalgae biofuel studies were excluded based on the agreement in the most recent reviews, meta-analyses, and harmonized LCA studies that emissions were not reduced consistently compared with fossil fuels [160][161][162] or, on average, even doubled. 163 For each individual combination of CCU technology and type of CO 2 source (fossil, biogenic, or atmospheric), the most recent study with the most complete life cycle inventory was selected. This resulted in 30 studies (1 on direct use, 15 on fuels and chemicals, 8 on mineral carbonates and construction materials, and 6 on EHR), together covering 44 unique CCU technologies and resulting in 74 combinations based on multiple CO 2 sources. If the same CCU process was presented with small changes in setup or composition, then the process with the lowest overall GHG emissions was used in this study. If several CO 2 sources of the same ''type'' (fossil, biogenic, or atmospheric) were given in the LCA, the source most likely to be deploying CO 2 capture in a 1.5 C pathway and to still exist in 2030 and 2050 was preferred (i.e., an industrial facility over a fossil fuel-based power plant and a natural gas power plant over a coal-fired power plant). For processes for which a pure biogenic source was not available but a source representing a mix of biogenic and fossil sources was available, the mix was included in addition to the fossil and atmospheric sources. When the emissions for the substitute were not included in the study, the emissions reported in another LCA for the same product were used and are referred to in Note S4.</p>
        <p>We apply a system expansion via substitution approach to solve the multifunctionality problem following the LCA standard ISO 14044 and LCA guidelines for CCU. 104 This method assumes that a primary production plant with CCU directly substitutes an identical plant without CCU to ultimately determine the emissions that can be associated with CCU itself. The GHG emissions of these two systems can be determined as shown in Equations 3 and 4:</p>
        <p>E plant w=o CCU = E upstream + E primary; direct + E primary; other (Equation 3)</p>
        <p>E plant with CCU = E upstream + E primary; other + E capture losses + E capture process + E conversion + E other + E released (Equation 4)</p>
        <p>where E stands for GHG emissions (in kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CO 2 utilized). All emissions are scaled to the functional unit of 1 kg of CO 2 utilized. We specifically distinguish the following GHG emissions:</p>
        <p>E upstream Upstream GHG emissions associated with extraction of resources or production of the carbon feedstock feeding into the primary production process (as feedstock and/or fuel), including handling and transport to the plant E primary; direct Direct CO 2 emissions emitted at the point source in the primary production process E primary; other Other (remaining) GHG emissions associated with the primary production plant E capture losses Emissions of CO 2 that are not captured in the capture process (capture is not 100% efficient) E capture process GHG emissions associated with capturing CO 2 and separating the CO 2 from the bulk gas stream (e.g., from additional electricity use) E conversion GHG emissions of the conversion process of the CO 2 into the end product E released Emissions of utilized CO 2 into the atmosphere at the end of life of the CCU product E other Other (remaining) GHG emissions associated with the CCU product, such as GHG emissions at end of life other than release of utilized CO 2</p>
        <p>The amount of CO 2 that is utilized in CCU can be determined as shown in Equation 5:</p>
        <p>(Equation 5)</p>
        <p>The GHG emissions that can be attributed to the CCU product via substitution can thus be determined via Equations 6a, 6b, 6c: 6a)</p>
        <p>Solving and filling in Equation 5then results in Equation 6c:</p>
        <p>In the case of DAC, there is no multifunctionality problem, but Equation 6c can still be used to determine E CCU because E utilized is simply the amount of CO 2 captured from the air. When the CO 2 must already be separated in the primary process, CO 2 is a by-product, and the capture emissions (E capture process ) are zero. Equation 6c is used in the main text as Equation 1.</p>
        <p>The substitution approach is based on the assumption that a point source without capture is 1:1 substituted by the same plant with capture. In the near future (i.e., 2030) this assumption holds because many plants without capture can still be substituted. In the long run, however, the reference system is expected to transform toward a zero-emissions economy. Therefore, in a Paris-compatible 2050 system, we can no longer assume that there are unabated fossil point sources to substitute and associated emissions to avoid. Because emissions are no longer unabated, considering CCU as an option to abate fossil CO 2 emissions means that the responsibility for not emitting shifts to CCU. In terms of calculating the GHG intensity of CCU for a fossil CO 2 source in 2050, this means that all emissions from the stack onward are assigned to the CCU product (Equation 7):</p>
        <p>E CCUðfossil in 2050Þ = E capture losses + E capture process + E conversion + E other + E released (Equation 7)</p>
        <p>Equation 7 is used in the main text as Equation 2.</p>
        <p>To calculate E capture losses in 2050, a high capture rate of 95% is assumed based on the finding that such high capture rates would be needed 32 and are expected to become dominant after 2040 122 under stringent decarbonization targets. Furthermore, in achieving a net-zero CO 2 system, Wevers et al. 81 found that going beyond a 95% capture rate would be energetically unfavorable for deploying DAC for the remaining 5%.</p>
        <p>In the results, we report E CCU , but when this applies to fossil CO 2 sources in 2050, Equation 7 is used for the calculation. For CCU processes based on biogenic or atmospheric CO 2 in 2050, Equation 6c still applies because the availability of these sources in 2050 is in line with a Paris-compatible scenario.</p>
        <p>To complement the ''Emissions of CCU technologies'' section and Note S4, which includes detailed assumptions according to the LCA study, this section provides details regarding overarching assumptions in harmonization of GHG emissions of CCU products.</p>
        <p>For some CCU products, not all carbon in the end product has its origin in captured CO 2 . Instead, some processes use fossil methane or methanol as additional feedstock; for example, in dry reforming of methane, where (captured) CO 2 and methane are used to produce CO and H 2 . 164 This results in emission of additional CO 2 besides the E released of 1 kgCO 2 /kg CO 2 utilized upon combustion of the chemical/fuel; these additional emissions are included in E other . Conversely, in CO 2 EOR, the CO 2 utilized to produce the hydrocarbon does not end up in the product itself but stays behind in the depleted oil field. The CO 2 is cycled and used several times in the process; the amount of CO 2 utilized per barrel of oil is taken to be the total amount of CO 2 injected in a well over the years of CO 2 EOR operation and divided by the total number of barrels of oil produced. Given that the CO 2 utilized is defined as the CO 2 stored in the well, E released is zero. The combustion of the produced hydrocarbon is included in E other .</p>
        <p>Several processes produce co-products with the CCU product or with the feedstock, leading to a multifunctionality problem. In ethylene production, propylene, butene, and hydrogen are co-produced; 78 in the electrochemical reduction process, O 2 and H 2 are co-produced; 107 and for hydrogen production via electrolysis, 7.94 kg O 2 /kg H 2 is co-produced. We follow the LCA standard ISO 14044 guidelines and apply the system expansion via substitution approach. In particular, we assume that the production of 1 kg of H 2 via electrolysis avoids the production of 7.94 kg of O 2 via cryogenic air separation. We used the production process of O 2 using air separation in EcoInvent v.3.6 and adapted this process to ensure harmonization of the electricity used in electrolysis and the substituted oxygen production process; we replaced the electricity source for the required 1.42 kWh/kg O 2 in the EcoInvent process by the 2030 and 2050 electricity mix used in the harmonization. In 2030, this results in an emission reduction factor of 22% for H 2 production because of substitution; we multiply the emissions for H 2 with a factor of 0.78; in 2050, with electricity assumed to be emission-free, H 2 production has (close to) zero emissions.</p>
        <p>For cement-based substitutes and CCU construction materials, we include the CO 2 uptake during the use phase and end-of-life phase, which is not included in the analyzed LCAs. Xi et al. 67 show that, from 1930 to 2013, 43% of the limestone calcination emissions in cement production were offset because of atmospheric CO 2 absorption in a natural cement carbonation process. Cao et al. 68 project that, from 2015 to 2100, 30% of cement production emissions are absorbed by cement carbonation, largely in line with Xi et al., 67 considering that calcination of limestone currently accounts for 58.4% of the CO 2 emissions of cement production. 68 To take this uptake of CO 2 into account, we multiply the emissions of cement production by a factor 0.7 to find the full life cycle emissions, including uptake.</p>
        <p>In our analysis, we assume that industrial waste as feedstock is impact free. Several processes in the mineral carbonates and construction materials category require input of industrial waste; e.g., steel slag, fly ash, or desalination brines. Although some studies assume that CCU avoids landfilling or processing of these waste streams, assigning avoided emissions to the CCU product, there is no consensus on how much these are (i.e., a factor 4 difference between avoided emissions from slag landfilling of À0.04 kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CaCO 3 66 and À0.16 kgCO 2 -equiv/kg CaCO 3</p>
        <p>). We follow the most regularly used and most conservative approach of assuming impact-free waste streams.</p>
        <p>We calculated the GHG intensity of CCU products without (base case) and with the benefit of temporary carbon storage (sensitivity analysis), using a time horizon of 100 years. To include the storage effect, E released in Equations 1 and 2 is multiplied by GWP storage -100, whose value depends on the product-specific lifetime (Table 2). For direct use of CO 2 in an agricultural greenhouse, a lifetime of less than 6 months is assumed, based on Mazotti et al. 129 For EHR, permanent storage 129 or at least millennia 11 is assumed. For mineral carbonates and construction materials, a lifetime of centuries to permanent is assumed, based on Hepburn et al., 11 Pan et al., 58 and Sanna et al., 56 except for sodium bicarbonate, which may release CO 2 upon use, assuming a lifetime of 6 months. In the fuels and chemicals category, for more stable chemicals (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyols), a lifetime of 50 years is assumed, based on the lifetime of months to decades for polymers 11 or decades to centuries for polyurethanes. 129 For the remainder of fuels and chemicals, a lifetime of 6 months is assumed, based on the lifetime of 6 months indicated for methanol and urea by Mazotti et al., 129 and for methane, Fischer-Tropsch fuels, and DME by Hepburn et al. 11</p>

        <p>cycle assessment (LCA) studies on CCU. In this way, 1,041 studies were identified (see experimental procedures). After screening these papers for relevance and excluding reviews and meta-analyses without original data, 106 studies remained (Note S3). We then selected the most recent study with the most complete life cycle inventory for each available combination of CCU technology and type of CO 2 source (fossil, biogenic, or atmospheric). Not all combinations could be found in the literature. This resulted in 30 studies (1 on direct use, 6 on EHR, 8 on mineral carbonates and construction materials, and 15 on fuels and chemicals), together covering 44 unique CCU technologies and resulting in 74 CCU technology-CO 2 source combinations (see Note</p>
