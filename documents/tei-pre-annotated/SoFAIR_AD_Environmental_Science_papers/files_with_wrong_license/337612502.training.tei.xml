        <p>Despite being one of the most remote regions of the planet, with oceanic and atmospheric circulation enclosing the continent from the rest of the Southern Ocean (Bargagli, 2008), Antarctica has a well-documented history of anthropogenic pollution (Szopińska et al. 2016).Despite being one of the most remote regions of the planet, with oceanic and atmospheric circulation enclosing the continent from the rest of the Southern Ocean (Bargagli, 2008), Antarctica has a well-documented history of anthropogenic pollution (Szopińska et al. 2016).</p>
        <p>Scientific articles surrounding the presence of plastic debris in Antarctica can be found dating back to the 1980s, with reports highlighting the entanglement of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) in discarded plastic waste (Bonner &amp; McCann, 1982), and the ingestion of plastic particles by breeding petrels (van Franeker &amp; Bell, 1988). Between the years 2000 and 2001, plastic debris in excess of 6000 items washed up on the shore of sub-Antarctic islands over a six month period (Eriksson et al. 2013), and more recently it was estimated that an average of 1794 items/km 2 of plastic debris are floating at sea around the Antarctic Peninsula (Lacerda et al. 2019). Additionally, the long term monitoring of anthropogenic debris reaching the shores of remote islands in the Scotia Sea region of the Southern Ocean has helped to track the accumulation of plastic over time, with over 350 kg recorded from 1989-2019 (Waluda et al. 2020). Microplastic pollution (&lt; 5 mm) is widely regarded by scientists and citizens alike as being a potential threat to marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions (Henderson &amp; Green, 2020).Scientific articles surrounding the presence of plastic debris in Antarctica can be found dating back to the 1980s, with reports highlighting the entanglement of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) in discarded plastic waste (Bonner &amp; McCann, 1982), and the ingestion of plastic particles by breeding petrels (van Franeker &amp; Bell, 1988).

        <p>Within Antarctica, the ingestion of microplastics has been described in species from a range of trophic levels, from benthic invertebrates (Sfriso et al. 2020) to top predators such as the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua; Bessa et al. 2019). The ingestion of microplastic particles has shown to have negative effects on a number of marine species from different environments in laboratory-based studies (Cunningham &amp; Sigwart, 2019). Additionally, microplastic pollution is known to act as a vector for the transportation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs; Rodrigues et al. 2019) which may have adverse effects through trophic transfer and subsequent bioaccumulation in top predators (Durante et al. 2016). Although microplastic pollution has been described extensively in a range of habitats from intertidal rocky shores (Ehlers &amp; Ellrich, 2020) to deep sea trenches (Zhang et al. 2020) globally, the literature describing the presence of microplastic pollution from Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is limited. Previous studies have identified microplastic pollution in surface waters of the Antarctic Peninsula (Lacerda et al. 2019;Suaria et al. 2020) and shallow coastal sediments of the Ross Sea (Munari et al. 2017), with one study sampling a small number of deep-sea sediments from regions north of the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ; Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013).Within Antarctica, the ingestion of microplastics has been described in species from a range of trophic levels, from benthic invertebrates (Sfriso et al. 2020) to top predators such as the gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua; Bessa et al. 2019).

        <p>In terms of deep-sea microplastic research, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean regions below the PFZ remain unstudied. As the Arctic deep-sea has shown to represent a major sink for microplastic pollution (Tekman et al. 2020), and as the Antarctic and Southern Ocean deepsea below the PFZ represent a more isolated system, the presence and accumulation of microplastic pollution in these regions requires immediate investigation. To our knowledge, no studies have assessed the abundance of microplastic pollution in sediments from multiple Antarctic regions and depths, including the deep-sea. In this study, we conducted the most comprehensive study of microplastic pollution from deep-sea habitats of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean to date. Here, we sampled deep-sea marine sediments from 30 individual sites within three Southern Ocean regions; the Antarctic Peninsula, South Georgia, and the South Sandwich Islands. The samples were collected at a number of depths ranging from 136m to 3633m. We aimed to determine whether microplastic accumulation would vary among sites and individual Antarctic and Southern Ocean regions. Additionally, we aimed to highlight whether microplastic accumulation was related to the core sampling depth or the sediment characteristics among cores, thus providing insights on the processes that may be responsible for their presence in these remote regions.In terms of deep-sea microplastic research, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean regions below the PFZ remain unstudied.

        <p>All sediment samples were collected using OKTOPUS multicores (MUC) on the following research expeditions between 2017 and 2019: JR17003a, (RRS James Clark Ross; Antarctic Peninsula), PS119 (RV Polarstern; South Sandwich Islands and South Georgia), and M134 (RV Meteor; South Georgia). One individual core from each of the 30 MUC sampling sites was utilised for the microplastic analysis. The number of cores analysed per region were as follows: Antarctic Peninsula (6), South Sandwich Islands (11), and South Georgia (13) (Fig. 1; Table 1). Only the 0-2 cm depth from each core was used in the analysis. The sediment was then mixed evenly prior to analysis as the accumulation of microplastics over time was not considered for this study. The 30 cores were placed into a pre-washed zip-lock bag and frozen at -20°C prior to analysis. As different core tubing diameters were used on each of the research expeditions (JR17003a; ø 10 cm, PS119; ø 6.7 cm, M134; ø 10 cm/ ø 6 cm), the weight of all cores and microplastic counts were subsequently scaled up and standardised to represent the largest core diameter utilised during the expeditions (ø 10 cm).All sediment samples were collected using OKTOPUS multicores (MUC) on the following research expeditions between 2017 and 2019: JR17003a, (RRS James Clark Ross; Antarctic Peninsula), PS119 (RV Polarstern; South Sandwich Islands and South Georgia), and M134 (RV Meteor; South Georgia).

        <p>Each of the 30 sediment cores were transferred to a pre-cleaned metal tray, labelled, placed in clean paper bags, and dried in an incubator at 40˚C until all moisture was removed. The cores were then gently ground using a pre-cleaned pestle and mortar and subsequently sieved through a 2 mm sieve. Any particles larger than 2 mm were removed from the analysis by sieving. Once sieved, the dry weight of the core was recorded and each core was then separated into eight representative subsamples using a Quantachrome Rotary Micro Riffler.Each of the 30 sediment cores were transferred to a pre-cleaned metal tray, labelled, placed in clean paper bags, and dried in an incubator at 40˚C until all moisture was removed.

        <p>Digestion with 30% hydrogen peroxide has already been applied to successfully remove organic material from animal tissues and sediment samples (Mathalon &amp; Hill 2014, Kolandhasamy et al. 2018) while at the same time avoiding the dissolution of the microplastics themselves (Li et al. 2016). The following day, the beakers were heated on a hotplate at 60˚C until the reaction was completed and subsequently left to cool overnight. To remove any calcium carbonate from the sediment, 2 mol hydrochloric acid (HCL) was added to each beaker and left to digest overnight at room temperature. Following this, the beakers were then heated again on the hotplate at 60˚C to ensure the reaction was completed. The subsamples and procedural blanks were then left to cool until the sediment had completely settled on the bottom of the beaker. The liquid was then removed using a 10 ml pipette and filtered deionized water was added to wash the sediment.Digestion with 30% hydrogen peroxide has already been applied to successfully remove organic material from animal tissues and sediment samples (Mathalon &amp; Hill 2014, Kolandhasamy et al. 2018) while at the same time avoiding the dissolution of the microplastics themselves (Li et al. 2016).

        <p>Each subsample and procedural blank was transferred into a pre-washed 50 ml falcon tube and labelled. They were then topped up to 45 ml with filtered deionized water and centrifuged (HERMLE Z 446) at 3000 rpm for three minutes for further washing. The water was then replaced and the sample agitated using a vortex mixer for 30 seconds before repeating the washing process. Once washed, the water was removed using a 50 ml pipette and 30 ml of sodium polytungstate (SPT; 1.6 g/cm 3 ) was added before further agitation (Zhang et al. 2018). The subsamples and procedural blanks were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes to float any potential microplastics from the sediment. Finally, the supernatant was decanted and subsequently vacuum filtered using a three piece Hartley pattern filter funnel and 25 mm VWR glass microfiber filter paper. Each filter paper was immediately covered and dried at 40˚C and the remaining SPT solution was removed and filtered for recycling.Each subsample and procedural blank was transferred into a pre-washed 50 ml falcon tube and labelled.

        <p>An initial visual analysis of potential microplastic pollution was carried out using a stereomicroscope. Microplastics were identified following the visual identification protocol from Nor &amp; Obbard (2014), i.e. particles that are bright/ unnatural and homogenously coloured, particles with no visible cellular or organic structures, and fibres that are equally thick and do not taper at the ends. All microplastic pollution was categorised into three categories; fibres, fragments, and films (Ehlers et al. 2019).An initial visual analysis of potential microplastic pollution was carried out using a stereomicroscope.

        <p>Once identified visually, the potential microplastics were measured (Sup Table 2) and photographed using a digital microscope (VHX-2000, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) before being transferred to aluminium oxide membrane filters (Whatman Anodisc filter; pore size 0.2 μm; diameter 47 mm) for subsequent spectroscopical analysis. This filter material is infrared inactive in the wavenumber range in which characteristic plastic polymer peaks can be found; therefore, it is recommended for transmission measurements in µFTIR spectroscopy (Löder et al. 2015). For the measurements, a subsample of the identified particles (20%; 29/147), well representing the range of MP found in the samples, were analysed manually using a Fourier-transform infrared microscope (µFTIR, Hyperion 2000, Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany; Ehlers et al. 2019). The µFTIR was equipped with a mercury-cadmium telluride detector and the measurements were performed in transmission mode with the blank filter material used for background measurements. For some thicker larger particles for which the transmission mode was not suitable the attenuated total reflectance (µATR) mode with a germanium crystal was used as suggested by several authors (Bergmann et al. 2017;Löder et al. 2015;Vianello et al. 2013;Zhang et al. 2019). The measurements were performed in a wavenumber range of 4000 to 600 cm -1 with 32 co-added scans and a spectral resolution of 4 cm -1 . Finally, each obtained spectrum was compared with the Bruker spectral library using the software 
            <rs type="software">OPUS</rs>
            <rs type="version">7.5</rs> to determine polymer types. For transmission measurements, only the part of the particle's spectrum between the wavenumbers 3800 cm -1 and 1250 cm -1 was analysed as aluminium oxide membrane filters are infrared inactive in that region (Löder et al. 2015).

        <p>Prewashed glassware was also utilised throughout the sample preparation and aluminium foil was used to cover samples at all times. In the case that plastic containers were used, they were prewashed twice using filtered deionised water and inspected prior to use for contamination under the stereomicroscope. All work benches and laboratory equipment were washed using deionised water and inspected for airborne contamination before and between each stage of the analysis. Further to this, 100% cotton laboratory coats and nitrile gloves were worn at all times. Additionally, natural fibre clothing was worn under laboratory coats throughout the analysis. Alongside the sediment subsamples, procedural blanks containing purified sand of equal weight to the subsamples were used to quantify any contamination throughout the digestion and filtration stages. Additionally, damp filter paper placed in petri dishes was left exposed to airborne contamination throughout the analysis to control for further contamination from the laboratory. Both procedural and laboratory blanks were quantified for microplastic pollution and accounted for during the analysis (Martin et al. 2017).Prewashed glassware was also utilised throughout the sample preparation and aluminium foil was used to cover samples at all times.

        <p>Fragments were the most common particle found and contributed to 56% (82/147) of the total microplastics overall. Fibres and films made up the remainder of the particles found representing 39% (57/147), and 5% (8/147), respectively. A total of seven different polymer types were identified from the µFTIR analysis; Polyesters (PEst, such as Alkyd), Polypropylene (PP), Polystyrene (PS), Polyurethane (PU), Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Rubber (TPE), and Acrylic polymers (AP; Fig. 2c). The majority of the microplastics found within this study were polyester which were identified as blue fragments (Fig. 3g; Sup Table 2), and a range of coloured fibres. These blue polyester fragments were found in 35% of the total sediment subsamples (32/90); and collectively, polyester accounted for 59% (17/29) of the identified microplastics subsample within the three regions (Fig. 2c). Additionally, the mean (±SE) MP/g for the procedural blanks was 0.16 ± 0.08 MP/g, indicating a low level of contamination overall.

No significant difference was found among the mean grain size at the three regions overall (ANOVA F = 2.67, P = 0.08). The Spearman's correlation test showed a significant linear relationship between the mean sediment grain size and the core sampling depth (S = 2317.8, P = 0.006).

        <p>The results from our analysis demonstrate consistently high levels of microplastic pollution in 30 different cores from three regions within Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive study to date that highlights microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments from Antarctic regions south of the PFZ. Disturbingly, our study reports very high benthic microplastic sediment loads (0 -9.52 MP/g; Sup (Sfriso et al. 2020).The results from our analysis demonstrate consistently high levels of microplastic pollution in 30 different cores from three regions within Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.

        <p>The number of fibres found within our sediment cores were lower than expected, as fibres are known to be ubiquitous and therefore dominate microplastic extraction studies (Cesa et al. 2017). It is likely that the main source of polyester fibres within our samples derive from synthetic clothing as synthetic fibres have been shown to release in high quantities during washing machine cycles (Napper &amp; Thompson, 2016). However, polyester fibres are also transported atmospherically when released from synthetic clothing during everyday use, and in quantities as high as washing machine cycles (De Falco et al. 2020). A previous study suggested that with the exception of the Antarctic Peninsula, microplastic fibre release would be low in Antarctic regions due to the lack of human population (Waller et al. 2017), although the Antarctic Peninsula showed the least number of fibres among our sediment cores.The number of fibres found within our sediment cores were lower than expected, as fibres are known to be ubiquitous and therefore dominate microplastic extraction studies (Cesa et al. 2017).

        <p>Many marine paints are based on acrylic polymers, polyesters (like alkyds; Song et al. 2014) and polyurethane (Lacerda et al. 2019). Hence, the acrylic, polyester, alkyd and polyurethane microplastic fragments that were found in the sampled Antarctic deep-sea sediments might derive from the varnish of ships, fishing vessels (Song et al. 2014) or marine stations. This is supported by the appearance of the particles (such as the blue colour of polyester fragments as well as their texture; see Fig. 3) which is similar to paint particles previously reported in other studies (Song et al. 2014;Lacerda et al. 2019) and the high resemblance of our acrylic polymer µFTIR spectra with the ones of poly(acrylate/styrene) reported by Song et al.

        <p>As the sediment cores did not come into contact with any ship surfaces or paint, we conclude that the microplastic fragments that we found in our samples did not derive from our ships as contamination. Recently, varnish particles were found in Arctic deep sea sediments (Tekman et al. 2020) and they were also found in Arctic sea ice cores (Peeken et al. 2018) and snow (Bergmann et al. 2019). Hence, they are prevalent even at remote locations.

        <p>although not statistically significant in comparison to the other regions, we expect that it is due to the increased footfall in this region (Waller et al. 2017). The most remote region, the South Sandwich Islands, had the next highest mean microplastic abundance (1.09 ± 0.22 MP/g), but only slightly higher than South Georgia (1.04 ± 0.39 MP/g). Although researchers (~ 10) are active on South Georgia all year round, and with tourists present in the summer months, the footfall is still relatively low (Gregory et al. 2017). Additionally, the South Sandwich Islands have no permanent residents at any point of the year, so we suspect that one of the drivers for microplastic accumulation in these regions is due to visiting research and fishing vessels (Waller et al. 2017). Furthermore, it is also possible that microplastic accumulation is the result of long range transportation in surface waters from neighbouring regions or beyond (Lusher et al. 2014). Previous studies have shown no correlation between human demographics and microplastic accumulation in the past, and suggest accumulation is driven rather by atmospheric and oceanic currents (Kane et al. 2020;Nel et al. 2017).although not statistically significant in comparison to the other regions, we expect that it is due to the increased footfall in this region (Waller et al. 2017).

        <p>In similarity to sediment particles, the density of microplastic polymers will alter how they are dispersed in marine environments, with low density particles maintaining positive buoyancy on the surface for longer than high density particles (Kane &amp; Clare, 2019).In similarity to sediment particles, the density of microplastic polymers will alter how they are dispersed in marine environments, with low density particles maintaining positive buoyancy on the surface for longer than high density particles (Kane &amp; Clare, 2019).</p>
        <p>However, microplastic of both high and low densities are known to sink to the benthos through a number of processes, such as biofouling (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013), attaching to marine snow, faecal pellets and phytoplankton heteroaggregates (Tekman et al. 2020) and transport to deeper waters and the sea floor through pelagic particle feeding (Choy et al 2019). Another recent study showed how microplastic particles positively correlate with the abundance of chlorophyll a in Antarctic sea ice; and as such, highlights another pathway for microplastic particles to enter the food chain and eventually sink (Kelly et al. 2020). These studies demonstrate that microplastic pollution can be dispersed via biological means in marine systems and this link highlights the need to further investigate the biotic content of sediment samples, which may help to explain the drivers behind sinking microplastic particles.However, microplastic of both high and low densities are known to sink to the benthos through a number of processes, such as biofouling (Van Cauwenberghe et al. 2013), attaching to marine snow, faecal pellets and phytoplankton heteroaggregates (Tekman et al. 2020) and transport to deeper waters and the sea floor through pelagic particle feeding (Choy et al 2019).

        <p>The mean sediment grain size for each core fell within the silt category (3.9 -62.5 µm) despite the range of sampling depths, however, high silt percentages of bottom sediment have been found around the Antarctic Peninsula (Wu et al. 2019), South Georgia (Graham et al. 2017), and the South Sandwich Islands (Howe et al. 2004) in the past. The presence of finegrain sediments such as silt (3.9 -62.5 μm) and clay (0.98 -3.9 μm) are generally associated with deep-sea environments, where sediment grain size decreases with increasing depth from coarse sand at shallower to mud at deeper depths (Li et al. 2018). Clays and silts are considered the result of terrestrial erosion that can be transported long distances and are deposited in deep-sea environments through a range of means, such as aeolian transport, turbidity currents, bottom currents and resedimentation processes (Stow &amp; Piper, 1984;Sweet &amp; Blum, 2016). Clays will settle in low energy environments (i.e. low current velocities) such as the deep-sea, as they are continually transported from higher to lower energy environments (Ergin &amp; Boder, 1998); however, low energy environments are also associated with shallower depths (Jackson et al. 2002) and exist at a range of depths within regions surrounding Antarctica (Harris &amp; O'Brien, 1996;Pirrie, 1998). This would help explain why all of the sediment cores from this study were dominated by &gt; 70% mud (silt and clay mix) despite the range of depths from 136 to 3633 m, and also explaining why sediment grain size increased significantly with depth among study samples (p = 0.006); although, the associated r 2 value of the correlation (0.118) showed low predictive reliability. As clay sediments are low in density and are transported through marine systems from high energy environments with higher current velocities to low energy environments (Ergin &amp; Boder, 1998), it is likely that microplastic pollution follows a similar pattern. This study shows that microplastic fragment levels were higher in sediment samples that contained a higher percentage of clay (P = 0.03); and as a result, suggests that microplastic fragment distribution and fate in marine systems is similar to the distribution of clay particles throughout the water column. However, microplastic fibres did not correlate with an increase in any particular sediment characteristic, which suggests their presence is decoupled from sedimentary processes, perhaps reflecting the fact that they can be transported through the air over large distances (Gasperi et al. 2018). This also may be compounded by large scale disturbance in the upper Southern Ocean; their small size and irregular shape may hinder their settling rates through the water column (Kowalski et al., 2016;Martin et al. 2017). It is also likely that microplastic fibres will re-suspend in benthic environments more easily due to their shape and size (Bagaev et al. 2017). In light of these findings, a recently published study used predictive modelling to determine the fate of microplastic particles in marine systems, and found that bottom currents and particle density are the driving force behind high microplastic accumulation in the Mediterranean deep-sea (Kane et al. 2020). By calculating the critical shear stress of microplastic particles, one can determine, within reason, the settling rates of different polymer types and shapes based on density and size (Kane et al. 2020;Zhang et al. 2017). With the addition of further samples, the consideration of biotic content in marine sediments, and the predictive modelling methods used by Kane et al. (2020), our study could be developed further, and as such, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the fate of microplastics in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean deep-sea.

        <p>The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and fronts in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) are physical barriers that enclose Antarctica and were initially thought to prevent species from travelling to and from the Southern Ocean (Brasier et al. 2017). We originally suspected our results were deriving from within the Antarctic system due to its isolation by the PFZ and ACC, however, studies have shown that marine debris, species, and particles have crossed these barriers in the past in certain regions (Convey et al. 2002;Galaska et al. 2017). There is also doubt that the ACC acts as a physical barrier for species or particles in the deep-sea (Clarke, 2003;Brandt et al. 2007), which suggests that the microplastic particles found within this study may originate from both north and south of the ACC. Although particles are known to cross the ACC from the Southern Ocean, it is likely that the ACC helps to transport microplastic pollution around Antarctica before subsequently being distributed by deeper currents, such as the Antarctic bottom current which helps distribute sediments around Antarctica (Heezen et al. 1966). Further, a recent study showed how bottom currents are responsible for the transport of microplastics in the Mediterranean (Kane et al. 2020), and another study described the transport of sediments via bottom currents in Antarctica (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2006). Recently, surface waters sampled around the entire coastline of Antarctica were shown to contain no microplastic pollution (Kuklinski et al. 2019); however, only three (PP, PS, TPE) of the seven polymer types found in this study were of a lower density than seawater, and it is therefore likely that the majority of microplastic pollution sinks rather than floats in surface waters around Antarctica where it is then transported by deeper currents (Kane et al. 2020). Furthermore, microplastics were found in the sub-surface waters of the Ross Sea (Cincinelli et al. 2017), and high levels were also recovered from shallow sediment samples in the Ross Sea (5 -1705 MP/m 2 ; Munari et al. 2017), and within deep-sea sediment throughout our study. Although the reported units used by Munari et al. (2017) are not comparable with our results, this further demonstrates that the benthos is the endpoint for microplastic particles in Antarctica. As the microplastic counts in this study (0 -9.52 MP/g or 0 -9520 MP/Kg) were higher than other reported values in less isolated systems outside Antarctica, and were similar to the high values found in the Arctic deep-sea (Tekman et al. 2020), the results from this study suggest that the Antarctic and SouthernThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and fronts in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) are physical barriers that enclose Antarctica and were initially thought to prevent species from travelling to and from the Southern Ocean (Brasier et al. 2017).
