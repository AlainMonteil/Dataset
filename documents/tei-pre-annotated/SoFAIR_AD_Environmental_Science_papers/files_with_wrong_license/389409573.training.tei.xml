        <p>Landfill has been a major contributor to surface and groundwater pollution if not constructively managed owing to the risk of leachate penetration into the land and aquifers. The generated leachate is considered a major public health threat to the environment. Thus, it must be retrieved and handled properly before discharging into the environment. Currently, there is no single widely acceptable method documented for proper treatment of leachate as conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot achieve a satisfactory level for degrading toxic substances present. This leads to an increasing interest in exploring various treatment processes for leachates to achieve maximum operational flexibility. Based on leachate characteristics, discharge requirements, technical possibilities, regulatory requirements and financial considerations, numerous techniques have been put in during leachate degradation, showing different degrees of effectiveness. Therefore, this review article presents a comprehensive review of existing research articles on the pros and cons of various leachate degradation methods. In line with environmental sustainability, the article stressed on the application and efficiency of sequencing batch reactor treating landfill leachate due to its operational flexibility, resistance to shock loads and high biomass retention. Contributions of integrated leachate treatment technologies with the reviewed system were also discussed. The article further analyzed the effect of different adopted materials, processes, strategies and configurations on leachate treatment. Environmental and operational parameters that affect the system were critically discussed. It is believed that information contained in this review will increase readers fundamental knowledge, guide future researchers and be incorporated into future works on experimentallybased studies for the treatment of leachate.Landfill has been a major contributor to surface and groundwater pollution if not constructively managed owing to the risk of leachate penetration into the land and aquifers.

        <p>Landfill is a large area of land, normally lined and used for disposal of waste materials (Tsilogeorgis, Zouboulis, Samaras, &amp; Zambouhs, 2008). It remains the major repository for disposal of residual wastes and incineration residues globally (Aluko &amp; Sridhar, 2013). Therefore, the unlawful disposal of solid waste at locations unprepared for landfilling could lead to unregulated leachate migration into the soil, surface water and even groundwater (Michalska, Gren, Zur, Wasilkowski, &amp; Mrozik, 2019). Leachate considered as an exceptionally saline complex sewerage as well an unavoidable product of a sanitary landfill (Ganjian et al., 2018;Mousavi, Almasi, Kamari, Abdali, &amp; Yosefi, 2015) can be defined as a reservoir with elevated concentrations of contaminants of emerging concern (Michalska, Pinski, Zur, &amp; Mrozik, 2020). It is the liquid formed due to the percolation of precipitation through an open landfill or the cap of a finished site and infiltration of groundwater into the landfill through wastes and biochemical processes (Aziz, Aziz, &amp; Yusoff, 2011a;Aziz, Aziz, Yusoff, &amp; Bashir, 2011;Narayan, Zargham, Ngambia, &amp; Riyanto, 2019).Landfill is a large area of land, normally lined and used for disposal of waste materials (Tsilogeorgis, Zouboulis, Samaras, &amp; Zambouhs, 2008).

        <p>The existence of moisture within landfilled solid waste greater than its field potential induces a variety of various physical and microbial processes to transform contaminants into liquid resulting in leachate formation (El-Fadel, Matar, &amp; Hashisho, 2013;Mousavi et al., 2015). Landfill leachates are generated at landfill sites when moisture blends with the landfill refuse (Chinade, Umar, Osinubi, &amp; Technology, 2017;Fudala-Ksiazek, Luczkiewicz, Fitobor, et al., 2014;Grosser et al., 2019). Leachate characteristics present high variation due to several factors as landfill operation, applied landfilling technology, waste age and climatic conditions (Remmas et al., 2018;Spagni &amp; Marsili-Libelli, 2009). Leachate contains significant amounts of biodegradable and non-biodegradable organic matter, heavy metals, phenols, NH4 + -N, sulphide and phosphate. It may also exhibit alkalinity, acidity or hardness (Aziz, Aziz, et al., 2011b). Thus, BOD/COD ratio has widely been used as a measure for biodegradation capacity (Ganjian et al., 2018). Highly conductive leachate indicates a high concentration of dissolved solids which would provide adsorptive sites for biofilm inoculated for pollutants degradation. Low BOD/COD ratio and slightly high pH indicates that landfill leachate is in a stabilized state with minimal biodegradability of the organic components present (Ranjan et al., 2016). The COD/TOC ratio of the leachate &lt; 2, is an indication of non-biodegradability (Ying, Xu, et al., 2012). Low DO concentration in leachate supports anaerobic conditions in the receiving water body and slow down the natural decomposition process supported by aerobic microorganisms (Aluko &amp; Sridhar, 2013). High concentrations of chemical, microbial, organic and inorganic pollutants depicted in Table 1 as the unique characteristics of municipal landfill leachate can potentially have hazardous and toxic effects on the environment and ecosystem (Pirsaheb, Hossini, Secula, Parvaneh, &amp; Ashraf, 2017).The existence of moisture within landfilled solid waste greater than its field potential induces a variety of various physical and microbial processes to transform contaminants into liquid resulting in leachate formation (El-Fadel, Matar, &amp; Hashisho, 2013;Mousavi et al., 2015).

        <p>Large quantities of leachate derived from landfill site pose a significant challenge in municipal solid waste disposal (MSW) (Neczaj et al., 2005). Leachate is one of the main environmental problems in landfilling (Yarimtepe &amp; Oz, 2018). Its most critical features are connected to the high concentrations of contaminants (Mojiri et al., 2014), continuous change of flow and its toxicity attributed to the presence of heavy metal and ammonia (Trabelsi et al., 2013). Given the hazardous and recalcitrant nature of its constituents, leachate leakage to land and aquifers is considered a significant environmental problem to public health (Remmas et al., 2018). If raw leachate is discarded of directly in a natural environment, it infiltrates and flows into nearby water bodies and severely contaminates surface and groundwater sources (Aziz et al., 2012;Tella &amp; Balogun, 2020). Thereby posing adverse health effect to the surrounding soil and affecting the entire ecological system including human health (Yong et al., 2018). Leachate is a dangerous and highly polluting liquid that contributes to surface and groundwater contamination unless controlled effectively (Aluko &amp; Sridhar, 2013). Thus, the law requires the treatment of hazardous constituents of leachate prior to discharge to avoid pollution of water supplies as well serious and persistent toxicity (Aziz, Aziz, et al., 2011b).Large quantities of leachate derived from landfill site pose a significant challenge in municipal solid waste disposal (MSW) (Neczaj et al., 2005).

        <p>Unless efficiently disposed, landfill may become an underlying source of pollution due to the risk of leachate infiltration into soil and groundwater. Therefore, it is imperative that the leachate produced is collected and handled efficiently before returning to the environment. Correct management of landfill site can drastically reduce the intensity and volume of leachate generated, though it cannot be eliminated (Tsilogeorgis et al., 2008). If raw leachate is disposed without any treatment, it may become a major source of water contamination because it can work its way into soils and subsoils, making the receiving water to become highly polluted (Chu, Zhang, &amp; Xu, 2008). The produced leachate can produce significant environmental problems and must be collected and handled appropriately prior discharging into the environment (Neczaj et al., 2008). Having a huge spectrum of intermediate organic degradation products and inorganic pollutants resulting from microbial activity in a landfill, compression and water flow, leachates from landfills pose dangerous environmental and health risks (Y. Xiao et al., 2009). Hence, landfill leachate management is regarded as a valuable subject intertwined with the environmental processing of sanitary landfills (Tan et al., 2016). Different governing laws as highlighted in Table 2 require the treatment of hazardous constituents of leachate prior to discharge in other to avoid pollution of water supplies and avoid severe and persistent toxicity (Aziz, Aziz, et al., 2011b). Hence, leachate treatment deems a major task in order to meet discharge limits (Trabelsi et al., 2013). The variation in values for standard limit of different regions might be attributed to certain environmental and economic circumstances (Sule Abubakar, Lawal, Hassan, &amp; Jagaba, 2016;A. Jagaba, Kutty, Hayder, Baloo, Abubakar, et al., 2020), as well as the adopted technology for leachate treatment.

        <p>Landfill leachate treatment technologies with low cost and improved efficiency are important for sewage treatment (Yin et al., 2018). Leachate treatment is considered a worldwide problem as it affects most countries. The basic difficulty in leachate treatment is the selection of combined reasonable, economical, and efficient processes and technologies. In addition, the major challenges associated with developing leachate treatment processes are the TN removal rate improvement and total cost reduction (K. Wang, Li, Tan, &amp; Wu, 2018). Treatment prior to discharge is a legal necessity to avoid environmental contamination (Aziz, Aziz, et al., 2011a). However, the treatment of highstrength organic content, complex chemical composition and seasonally diverse volume of leachate owing to rainwater ingress into the landfill is often complicated (Aluko &amp; Sridhar, 2013;Fongsatitkul et al., 2008). Low biodegradability and C:N ratio of landfill leachate poses high challenges for treatment (Miao et al., 2014). At present, there is no single unit process available for proper leachate treatment as conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot achieve a satisfactory level for degrading toxic substances present (Bu et al., 2010;D. B. Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, there is a growing interest in examination of different leachate treatment processes for maximum operational flexibility (Yarimtepe &amp; Oz, 2018). Based on leachate characteristics, discharge requirements, technical possibilities, regulatory requirements and financial considerations, several techniques have been adopted for degrading this highly diverse organic effluent, presenting varying degree of efficiency (El-Fadel et al., 2013;Fudala-Ksiazek et al., 2014;Neczaj et al., 2008;Remmas et al., 2018). These techniques do consider landfill leachate age classification as a guide for selecting suitable treatment for a particular leachate (Yong et al., 2018). Recently, leachate treatment plants combine one or more treatment strategies for biodegradable and non-biodegradable substances present (Contrera et al., 2014;Neczaj et al., 2005;Spagni &amp; Marsili-Libelli, 2009). Fig. 1 summarizes the evolution of main published works on landfill leachate treatment. Data extracted from Web of Science core-collection over 2005-2020. The search was made by Topic using 'Leachate treatment" as the keyword. It is evident that in the past few decades, leachate treatment received significant attention as the number of articles exponentially increases. This could be attributed to environmental effect of leachate resulting from massive solid waste generation.Landfill leachate treatment technologies with low cost and improved efficiency are important for sewage treatment (Yin et al., 2018).

        <p>In order to increase performance efficiency and meet the industrial effluent discharge stringent regulatory requirements (Vukovic, Cosic, Kucic, Kopcic, &amp; Briski, 2012), several factors are taken into account before determining which treatment method and material should be applied at a specific landfill based on their merits and demerits, and also considering the landfill age as highlighted in Tables 3, 4 and 5. and . The key factor is the treatment cost which varies among methods and even within each method depending on the composition of landfill leachate and local environmental regulations. Other significant factors include land and operating cost (Dogaris, Ammar, Philippidis, &amp; Biotechnology, 2020). The existing methods of leachate recovery, reuse and degradation can be principally grouped into: (i) biodegradation (via aerobic and/or anaerobic processes); (ii) physicochemical method, (iii) a combination of (i and ii), (iv) Leachate transfer [co-treatment of leachate with other wastewaters (Municipal/domestic wastewater treatment plants) and Recycling] (v) other potential alternatives available (Capodici et al., 2014;Contrera et al., 2014;Mojiri et al., 2014). The integration of physicochemical and biological processes has the potential to synergize the benefits of each single process and has been reported to be effective in the treatment of stabilized landfill leachate (Wu et al., 2011).In order to increase performance efficiency and meet the industrial effluent discharge stringent regulatory requirements (Vukovic, Cosic, Kucic, Kopcic, &amp; Briski, 2012), several factors are taken into account before determining which treatment method and material should be applied at a specific landfill based on their merits and demerits, and also considering the landfill age as highlighted in Tables 3, 4 and 5. and .

        <p> Physicochemical processes Physicochemical processes are usually applied for the pre-treatment, post-treatment and advanced treatment of landfill leachate (Miao et al., 2015). They are suitable for the removal of refractory substances from stabilized leachate (Kurniawan et al., 2006). They can also be used for specific pollutant degradation (Renou, Givaudan, Poulain, Dirassouyan, &amp; Moulin, 2008). However, they are costly, generate secondary pollution coupled with lower effectiveness and reliability (Tsilogeorgis et al., 2008;Yin et al., 2018). They also possess lower effectiveness and less reliability. The common physicochemical processes are highlighted in Fig. 2. Physicochemical processes Physicochemical processes are usually applied for the pre-treatment, post-treatment and advanced treatment of landfill leachate (Miao et al., 2015).

        <p>The traditional nitrification-denitrification (Biological) processes are used as the major landfill leachate treatment techniques. However, the utilization of organic substances in aerobic processes results to severe carbon supply shortage for the subsequent anoxic denitrification (Miao et al., 2015). Biological treatment has sub-divisions as shown in Fig. 2. Anaerobic systems offer advantages such as: high organic loading rates capacity; methane production; low sludge generation and the capability of retaining microbes with special functions (Miao et al., 2016). Several studies proved the biological treatment processes based on suspended-growth biomass, exhibit satisfactory and consistent performance in terms of organic carbon and nutrients removal due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness (Aziz et al., 2012;Contrera et al., 2014;Luo et al., 2020;Mojiri et al., 2014;Ranjan et al., 2016;Yin et al., 2018). Thus, providing enough hydraulic residence time. Other available landfill leachate treatment options include leachate recirculation through the landfill, spray irrigation on abutting grassland, on-site treatment, re-injection, leachate evaporation using evaporation ponds and landfill-generated methane as fuel or a combination (Neczaj et al., 2008;Ranjan et al., 2016). Therefore, to comply with the strict regulation of nitrogen release and potential effect of recalcitrant leachate components during biological treatment stage, an increasing demand exists for advanced studies on leachate treatment and disposal.The traditional nitrification-denitrification (Biological) processes are used as the major landfill leachate treatment techniques.

        <p>SBR system performance may be influenced by several factors to include: influent characteristics, organic loading rate, carbon source, pH, DO, ORP HRT, SRT, feed pattern, anoxic/oxic ratio, cycle length, settleability and temperature (Rollemberg et al., 2019). Short settling time selects rapid settling bacteria while poor settleability sludge is effectively removed. Low temperature is considered a severe challenge in simultaneous N and P removal systems, and receives exploration because it has an unfavorable impact on microbial activity in activated sludge (Sekine, Akizuki, Kishi, &amp; Toda, 2018).SBR system performance may be influenced by several factors to include: influent characteristics, organic loading rate, carbon source, pH, DO, ORP HRT, SRT, feed pattern, anoxic/oxic ratio, cycle length, settleability and temperature (Rollemberg et al., 2019).

        <p>The basic operation cycle of an SBR is composed of five sequence stages. They are: Fill, React, Settle, Draw, and Idle Fill: At the filling stage, reactor is loaded with wastewater mixed with biomass by either gravity or pumping between reactor low and high-water levels for microbial activity. The fill strategy which may be controlled by a timer could be aerated, static and mixed fill. In static filling, the available biomass in the SBR is combined with influent wastewater without mixing. Pulse substrate feeding is used for filling, where fill and reaction periods are separated. During the mixed fill, otherwise called "simultaneous filling and decanting -reaction -settling" at constant volume, combined long fill and reaction periods could be beneficial for treating high-strength inhibitory wastewater. Both mixing and aeration occur in the reaction filling stage. Fill length relies on reactor quantity, volume and the flow rate of the effluent. Usually, the durations last for 25% of the entire cycle time. Determination of feed volume depends on desired loading, detention time and expected settling characteristics of the organisms while time to fill depends on extent of diurnal variations in the influent flow rate, reactor capacity and number of parallel reactors in operation.The basic operation cycle of an SBR is composed of five sequence stages.

        <p>React: In the reaction point, the flow of wastewater to the reactor is limited while the initial filling reaction continues and expected to be terminated by aeration and mixing. Reactions started during filling are accomplished to provide high level of nutrients removal. The reaction time can be designed to exceed 50% of the total cycle time. However, react phase duration may depend on liquid control levels in a multi-tank system, timers or when the degree of treatment required has been reached. Treatment to obtain anaerobic, anoxic, or aerobic conditions is regulated by air, either on or off.React: In the reaction point, the flow of wastewater to the reactor is limited while the initial filling reaction continues and expected to be terminated by aeration and mixing.

        <p>Settle: In the settle stage, the reactor functions as a serial clarifier without any injection or discharge. MLSS settles, allowing the formation of a clear supernatant in the upper level of the reactor. The settle period last between 15-20% of the total cycle time to forbid solid cover from floating as a result of gas build-up. Draw: In this stage, either fixed, floating pipe or adjustable weirs withdrawal mechanism is adopted to discharge the clarified supernatant after a substantial depth of supernatant has been formed. Designed draw time can vary from 5 to &gt; 30% of the total cycle duration. Idle: It is basically the time needed between the draw and fill stage when several reactors are in active at a given time.Settle: In the settle stage, the reactor functions as a serial clarifier without any injection or discharge.

        <p>In this stage, biomass mixing to condition the reactive contents is carried out.

        <p>The main aim of using laboratory scale reactors is to investigate the potential economic and environmental sustainability of the system and later use the findings for possible pilot and full scale SBR design. The laboratory scale reactors vary in size and shapes using different materials ranging from plastic, thermoplastic, glass, etc. They are mostly compatible with flexibility potential. The laboratory-scale SBRs were used to extract carbon and nutrients and also to establish biodegradability assays for wastewater. A laboratory scale SBR study investigated the viability of leachate co-treatment with synthetic wastewater using respirometric techniques, in terms of operational efficiency and biomass behavior. The results showed good COD and NH4 + -N removal efficiencies with significant respiration rates obtained for the heterotrophic population. Thus, suggesting and confirming the feasibility of leachate co-treatment with a readily biodegradable wastewater (Capodici et al., 2014). Alternating anoxic/aerobic conditions for nitrogen extraction in a laboratory scale SBR, transient instability of aerobic granules associated with filamentous outgrowth was observed. Granules and flocs interbred in the same reactor, with unique composition and structure of aggregates. Data showed complete elimination of nitrogen, with temporary accumulation of nitrite in the aerobic phase until maximum depletion of ammonia. Microbial biomass evaluation revealed that granules contained the majority of the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) while the ammoniumoxidizing bacteria (AOB) appeared to be more abundant in the flocs (Carvalho, Meyer, Yuan, &amp; Keller, 2006). Sludge reduction through returned biomass fasting coupled with nutrient removal was successfully demonstrated using two laboratory scale SBRs. Sustainable enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), nitrification and sludge reduction could be maintained in the modified SBR when operated at a finite SRT with an observed biomass yield of 0.07 mg TSS mg/L COD.

        <p>In terms of greenhouse gas emission, NO and N2O accumulation during nitrite denitrification could be due to low pH and high influent loading especially in leachate. N2O production during nitrogen removal was investigated in a lab-scale aerobic-SBR. Results showed that the generation of N2O-N was &gt; 1.87 mg / L and converted to N2O by up to 4% of the nitrogen taken out. No N2O was generated during denitrification as nitrification was the key source of N2O production during nitrogen removal. Denitrification, therefore, had the ability to regulate production of N2O (X. H. Liu, Peng, Wu, Akio, &amp; Peng, 2008). The diagnosis of acidification and efficient recovery of a lab-scale anaerobic SBR (ASBR) showed that acidification occurred on the seventh day after adding 20 mmol/L of sodium 2bromoethanesulfonate into the reactor. This frustrated the methane production rate. Results indicated that the acidified ASBR can be revived in approximately 50 d. Large amounts of Methanosarcina-like and rod-shaped methanogens were distributed in the sludge flocs after reactor restoration and ensured that the fermentative, acidogenic, and methanogenic processes proceeded effectively in the anaerobic system (Hou et al., 2015).In terms of greenhouse gas emission, NO and N2O accumulation during nitrite denitrification could be due to low pH and high influent loading especially in leachate.

        <p>In a comparative study, the efficiency and consistency of a full-scale SBR plant can be assessed by a lab-scale SBR as proven by (Schwitalla et al., 2008) where the amounts of NH4 + -N desorption and desorption using one normal KCl solution NH4Cl during one cycle slightly vary among the five analyzed full-scale SBR plants. The tendencies for both NH4 + -N desorption and adsorption capacities were consistent. The desorption minima occur at the end of nitrification as well as up to one hour afterwards while the activated sludge samples had the highest adsorption capacities after the nitrification phase.In a comparative study, the efficiency and consistency of a full-scale SBR plant can be assessed by a lab-scale SBR as proven by (Schwitalla et al., 2008) where the amounts of NH4 + -N desorption and desorption using one normal KCl solution NH4Cl during one cycle slightly vary among the five analyzed full-scale SBR plants.

        <p>Bench scale SBR are small scale systems placed on either a laboratory worktable, glovebox or in a lab hood to handle wastewater ≤ 50 L/d at a given point in time depending on flow rates. They are fabricated and used to substantiate that the system can be safely operated and capable of yielding desired product before scaling up to either laboratory, pilot or full-scale systems. Most of the pilot-and full-scale systems use constant-volume SBRs since they have a simpler operation than conventional SBRs, whose filling and decanting phases must be carried out in a relatively short period of time and applying a large pumping system (Rollemberg et al., 2019). In studies with bench-scale units, high production of a viscous slime-like material known as extracellular polymers (EPS) or exopolysaccharides could be observed. Thus, primarily causing a reduction of mass transfer fluxes and decreasing the organic matter removal (Miqueleto, Dolosic, Pozzi, Foresti, &amp; Zaiat, 2010). According to literature, gradually increasing municipal sludge deep dewatering filtrate (MSDDF) in a bench scale SBR up to 84 days led to the domestication of stable Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) of yellowish-brown coloration, dense and irregular sphere with excellent degradation performance. The reactor yielded 95%, 96%, 99% and 88% for COD, TN, NH4 + -N and TP removals respectively (Long, Yang, Pu, Yang, Shi, et al., 2014). AGS can be successfully cultivated rapidly in a bench scale SBR within 21 days. Bench scale SBR strictly controlled in the laboratory were used to obtain strategies for AGS stability enhancement. These include: applying appropriate operational parameters; reinforcing granular core, enrichment of slow-growing organisms; strengthening granular core or the inhibition of anaerobic activity (Long et al., 2019).Bench scale SBR are small scale systems placed on either a laboratory worktable, glovebox or in a lab hood to handle wastewater ≤ 50 L/d at a given point in time depending on flow rates.

        <p>Studies on laboratory scale SBR has facilitated design specifications and operational parameters necessary for the construction and operation of a pilot-scale system. The system is scaled up for treating up to 50% of a total actual flow. To ensure high performance efficiencies of pilot scale systems, laboratory scale study is required prior to implementation. Although the results obtained with SBR systems at laboratory scale are promising, there are few studies carried out at pilot scale. Therefore, more information about granulation, biogas production, solid waste digestion and nutrients degradation alongside their performance at larger scale is needed to confirm if SBR application at large scale with attached control systems could be feasible for leachate treatment (Yang et al., 2009).Studies on laboratory scale SBR has facilitated design specifications and operational parameters necessary for the construction and operation of a pilot-scale system.

        <p>Four automated DO control strategies in a pilot SBR were tested and evaluated: ON/OFF, PID, fuzzy and composite fuzzy control strategies. Study concludes that the composite fuzzy control strategy is proved to be the robust and effective controller for the DO concentration (Shen, Tao, Ning, Liu, &amp; Ieee, 2012). A pilot-scale SBR system using different HRTs was developed and applied. Results showed that COD removal efficiencies are 72.5, 87.8, 98.4, 98.4%, for the different HRTs of 5, 3, 1, and 0.5, 1, 3 and 5 d, respectively while BOD removals were 58.0, 90.4, 99.3 and 99.6% respectively. Thus, the pilot-scale SBR system as depicted in Fig. 3 with automation was feasible, effective to be certified for use in wastewater treatment (Su, Huang, Wang, &amp; Hong, 2018). Modified IWA activated sludge model No 3 (ASM3) described the dynamics of a pilot-scale SBR during its cyclic operation (Ni et al., 2009). A pilot-scale anaerobic sequence batch biofilm reactor (AnSBBR) could be an option for anaerobic pretreatment of landfill leachate, because COD removal efficiency exceeded 70% with high biodegradability. The first-order kinetic model is adequate for the simulation and expansion of these leachate treatment systems (Contrera et al., 2014). In another report, pilotscale H2-producing ASBR was operated at various C/N ratios. At C/N ratio &gt;20, H2 production yield dropped and accompanied by increased production of lactate, propionate, and valerate. Alkaline shock of the whole mixed liquor significantly enhanced the H2 yield (Kim, Kim, Kim, &amp; Shin, 2010). Pilot scale capacity depends on factors as, wastewater influent volume and composition, available land, funding etc. According to literature, the capacity ranged from 1 -3000 L. Nitrification denitrification process in a pilot SBR was however achieved with a lower rate than that observed in the lab-scale system. This might be attributed to the lower temperature (25 o C) and the composition of the raw wastewater treated in the pilot system, compared with the operating conditions of the lab-scale SBR system (Kornaros, Marazioti, &amp; Lyberatos, 2008). Findings revealed that it takes 30 min to completely oxidize Fe(II) in a pilotscale SBR, and with further optimization of SBR operation the number of cycles required to achieve acceptable Fe(II) oxidation can be reduced (Zvimba, Mathye, Vadapalli, Swanepoel, &amp; Bologo, 2013).Four automated DO control strategies in a pilot SBR were tested and evaluated: ON/OFF, PID, fuzzy and composite fuzzy control strategies.

It took the pilot-scale SBR around 400 days to turn activated sludge into granule-dominant sludge compared with 1 or 2 months needed by a lab-scale reactor for aerobic granulation. The cultivated aerobic granular sludge under high influent quality fluctuation was irregular, pale yellow coloration, average particle size and could maintain long-term structural stability under short setting time environment. NH4 + -N, COD, and TN removal efficiencies were above 98, 80 and 50%, respectively (Long, Yang, Pu, Yang, Jiang, et al., 2014).Aerobic granulation of activated sludge was successfully developed in a pilot-scale SBR using the selection pressure and crystal nucleus method under sludge age control.

        <p>The full-scale reactor represents the original and final prototype designed, constructed and operated on site. It is mostly in a large-scale format representing a treatment plant. Studies from the pilot scale system usually facilitates the design parameters and operational conditions necessary for the development of full-scale SBR. Well-designed full-scale SBR as depicted in Fig. 4 allows a reduction of the landmass needed for land application of wastewater treatment by about 75% (Lo &amp; Liao, 2007). Full-scale applications are regulated using punctual fillings. Significant denitrification rate and a part phosphorus-release during sedimentation phase takes place at a higher rate with additional filling. According to (H. Fernandes, Jungles, Hoffmann, Antonio, &amp; Costa, 2013), influent quality variations were responsible for significant changes in the microbial composition over time as depicted by band profile. In a Full-scale SBR study, mature aerobic granules with a compact structure, average SVI30 of 47.1 mL/g, diameter of 0.5 mm, and settling velocity of 48 m/hr were obtained after 337 days of operation from a full-scale SBR while low DO, temperature or influent COD/N were responsible for higher N2O emission (Sun, Cheng, &amp; Sun, 2013).The full-scale reactor represents the original and final prototype designed, constructed and operated on site.

        <p>Modelling is suitable for the operation and optimization of full-scale SBR plants. Activated Sludge Model No. 1 (ASM1) and its variations (ASM2d and ASM3) with the advantage of easy cycle adaptation were used to forecast the behavior of a full-scale SBR employed to treat wastewater, predict and mitigate N2O production and emission. Utilizing 
            <rs type="software">ASIM</rs>® software and adopting the ASM1 model, a study identified nitrifier denitrification as the major biological process for N2O production using N2O data of two different cycles for the model calibration (Massara et al., 2017). In a similar study, ASM1 model best simulates a one-input cycle while the ASM3 model was the best for the step-feed cycle. The one-input cycle gave better nutrient removal. However, the step-feed cycle was harder to calibrate (Oselame, Fernandes, &amp; Costa, 2014). The ASM3 model effectively operated even under perturbation conditions and accurately simulate short-term effects arising from the variation of influent organic loadings such as in leachate. The performance of various reactors for treating young, intermediate and mature leachate is summarized in Table 6. This is to clearly state the contribution of SBR system in treating landfill leachate. The table further explain the notable observations made during each study in the remark section. It could be observed that most treatment focused on cost-effectiveness of the system, sludge reduction, improved granulation and resistance to shock loadings due to leachate influent variability. 7. Findings revealed that sludge escapes from the SBR unit whenever the process is disturbed resulting to high concentrations of suspended solids, BOD7, and phosphorus (N. Laitinen et al., 2006). SBR can be enhanced by the addition of plastic media into the reactor through coagulation to increase the specific surface area of the reactor (Yong et al., 2018). In an integrated treatment system coupling SBR, GAC adsorption and aeration corrosive cell-Fenton (ACF), almost all of the carboxylic acids and protein substances were biodegraded in SBR ,while leachate aromaticity was increased after SBR treatment (Bu et al., 2010). Sequencing internal micro-electrolysis reactor (IME) reactor was more efficient and faster than conventional electrolysis treatments (Ying, Peng, et al., 2012). In the SBR, Fenton Oxidation, Coagulation, and Biological Aerated Filtering (BAF) combined system, SBR was instrumental in the elimination of organic contaminants, while coagulation and fenton oxidation progressively reduced organic load and improved biodegradability. Coagulation was accomplished with low organic contaminants and high turbidity removals, and BAF removed low molecular weight fractions (Wu et al., 2011). A study by (Mojiri et al., 2017) revealed that SBR is ineffective in color removal from leachate with low biodegradability. However, adding composite adsorbent remarkably improves the removal. Ozonation process is effective in improving the BOD/COD ratio. Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (MAP) Precipitation increases C/N ratio by decreasing NH4-N concentration. Thus, high concentration of Cl2 after pretreatment with MAP will adversely affect the microbiological function of the successor SBR system (M. Chen, He, Yi, &amp; Yang, 2010). Attaching a trickling filter (TF) to an SBR system, the mean concentration of NO3 in effluents of the mature leachate increased owing to activities of nitrifying microorganisms (Aluko &amp; Sridhar, 2013). Bio-effluents from a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) were further degraded by the subsequent electro-Fenton process. This results from the good correlation that exist between the absorbance of leachate at 254 nm (UV254) and COD/TOC (D. B. Zhang et al., 2014). The use of Al2(SO4)3 as a coagulant in SBR + Coagulation-Settling process resulted to shorter reaction time, with effluent becoming cleaner and more visible (Trabelsi et al., 2013). Other treatment combinations include: SBR with continuous systems, UASB, photocatalysis, chemical precipitation, vertical flow constructed wetland, electrochemical process, AOP, moving bed biofilm reactor, high-rate algae pond, acidogenic co-fermentation, Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS), zero-valent iron column, membrane filtration system, anaerobic baffle reactor, and sand filter.

        <p>Several useful environmental and operational parameters have been successfully applied for leachate treatment in the past few decades (Ye et al., 2009). There is a definitive relationship between treatment efficiency and these parameter as they highly influence the performance of the SBR system. These can be ascertained by observing their influence on biological dephosphatation, nitrification and denitrification, impact on the microbial community structure and population, granulation, toxicity, biofilm formation, substrate storage and utilization (Liao, Droppo, Leppard, &amp; Liss, 2006). They also help in understanding floc structure, properties, and mechanisms of bioflocculation.

        <p>Aeration plays a significant role in aerobic sludge granulation (Menezes et al., 2019). Slow aeration rate in SBR system could reduce the NOx -(NO2 -and NO3 -) concentration, which reduces the carbon demand for denitrifying bacteria and leads to more carbon sources available for denitrification process. The oxygen-limited condition could improve wastewater biodegradability and reduce toxicity of refractory compounds, thereby further sustaining the dominant growth of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in SND process. Faster aerobic granulation results from high aeration rate as stated in literature. Also, to preserve the stability of aerobic granules, it is desirable to provide inhibiting overgrowth of filamentous bacteria appropriate hydraulic sharpening power. However, it has some disadvantages: high cost resulting from energy consumption, failure in TN removal, destruction of anaerobic conditions leading to low phosphorus removal etc. Attempts have been made to regulate the high aeration rate, but failed as the long-term stability enjoyed by aerobic granules were lost due to the changes in shear forces, nitrification was inhibited due to limited oxygen available. Reducing the aeration period has been identified as the best aeration regulatory measure (J. W. Lim, Lim, &amp; Seng, 2012). The aeration phase of a conventional SBR system can be modified giving rise to an intermittent aeration sequencing batch reactor IASBR. Intermittent aeration in SBR is a strategy where aeration and non-aeration periods are alternately repeated to create aerobic and anoxic conditions, efficient nitrogen removal from wastewater. It can be operated by modifying the react phase of system cycle, i.e alternating aeration and mixing under imprecise control conditions of DO, pH, and temperature (Zheng, Zhang, Liu, &amp; Lei, 2018). Intermittent aeration can be a useful strategy for N2O mitigation during wastewater treatment and an alternative to keep low concentrations of oxygen (Menezes et al., 2019). The main advantages of applying intermittent aeration in SBR include enhanced nitrogen removal and decreased the operating costs due to a reduction in the continuous supply of oxygen and the quantity of energy source required for the resulting denitrification phase. Nevertheless, the denitrification process may be interrupted where there is insufficient availability of carbon source as an electron donor.Aeration plays a significant role in aerobic sludge granulation (Menezes et al., 2019).

IASBR results in reduced oxygen demand and organic substrate for ammonia removal and denitrification respectively. Unlike the SBR, The IASBRs showed higher nitrification and denitrification rates, obtaining 88-99% NH4 + -N and 77-79% TN removal. The concentration of denitrification-based bacteria in IASBRs was greater than in SBR (Sheng, Liu, Song, Chen, &amp; Tomoki, 2017).

        <p>Agitation rate plays an important role in the provision of good mixing conditions, solubilization of suspended organic material and improving mass transfer. These properties lead to increasing substrate consumption rate which may subsequently reduce the total cycle duration. In an SBR system, agitation can be provided by mechanical stirring, recirculation of biogas and liquid recirculation. Increasing the resistance to mass transfer obviously altered the dynamics of volatile acid production and use, thereby allowing the mechanism to reach various apparent steady states when the agitation rate decreased. The study (Penteado et al., 2011), thus concluded that systemic agitation not only improved the global efficiency of organic matter removal but also influenced the production and consumption of volatile acids. In another study, it was found that the output of biogas could not be sufficient to enhance the turbulence needed to minimize both the incidence of potential stagnant zones and the resistance to mass transfer. Thus, an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) was developed where agitation was accomplished by recirculation of the effluent by means of a diaphragm pump. Authors finalized that it is possible to utilize effluent recirculation as a means of agitation. To verify the efficiency of recirculation, optimum recirculation velocity for an ASBR system used in wastewater treatment was evaluated. Findings revealed that the system was restricted by mass transfer when running at lower speeds. Higher velocities, however, may decrease microbial activity because of too much shearing, which could damage the flocs contained in the biomass and cause rupture of the granules, leading to poor solid separation (Maurina et al., 2014).Agitation rate plays an important role in the provision of good mixing conditions, solubilization of suspended organic material and improving mass transfer.

        <p>The function of superficial gas velocity (SGV) is not just to shape the structure of aerobic granules but also to influence the efficiency of biological removal. Size and density of aerobic granular sludge are dependent on the superficial gas velocity. High superficial gas velocity (HSGV) typically results in the formation of sludge granules with small volume, compact structure, large internal mass transfer resistance and good settling that are easily discharged because of their small size, leading to loss of sludge and decreased reactor efficiency. In compact sludge particles, microbes located deep within the granules receive an insufficient nutrient supply. On the contrary, low superficial gas velocity (LSGV) has been reported to provide better pollutant degradation performance than more compact granules despite the low density, poorer settling performance, and low mass transfer resistance of the produced granules (He, Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Wang, 2017). The low mass resistance can aid microbes resided within granules with sufficient energy supply. LSGV is said to be an efficient and effective capacity for concurrent nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus elimination during operation. Its activity ratio is said to be better than the seed sludge.The function of superficial gas velocity (SGV) is not just to shape the structure of aerobic granules but also to influence the efficiency of biological removal.

        <p>SBRs could sometimes be fed an excess of particulate organics, that might require additional hydraulic retention time (HRT) to process, while a temporary increase in wastewater volume or the sudden break down of one of the reactors may impose a hydraulic overload on the biological process. In dealing with complex wastewater as leachate, it is essential to study reactor performance during shock loading conditions. The sudden change of influent concentration, or organic shock loading, can eventually disrupt the treatment system performance. Stress to the bioreactor due to shock loading can be normalized by adding excess of simple carbon source, reducing OLR by half initial value and/or sludge replacement prior to further experimentation (Kulkarni, 2012). During shock loading, the experimental recovery period is mostly greater than the theoretical period. This could be due to the inhibitory effects of toxic compounds present in the wastewater (Mizzouri &amp; Shaaban, 2013).

        <p>HRT is an essential property during biological wastewater and hydrogen production process due to its of its substrate uptake efficiency and ability to determine the economics of hydrogen production process (Shariati et al., 2011). The design of HRT imposes a significant effect on the infrastructure and operational costs in an engineered bioreactor. HRT can be reduced by the introduction of membrane modules. The change of membrane modules can further lead to a decrease in HRT by increasing the permeability and an operating flux. Presence of DO and long hunger period during the treatment process can lead to incomplete denitrification (Scheumann &amp; Kraume, 2009). HRT decrease in the range 8-24 h, led to an increase in biomass concentration which did not improve removal efficiency (S. N. Xu, Wu, &amp; Hu, 2014). However, it contributed to the increase in the sludge particle size range, concentration of SMPc, apparent viscosity and a subsequent rise in membrane fouling rates. Higher MLSS at lower HRT is consistent with earlier published findings and can be due to the rise in OLR (Shariati et al., 2011). Similarly, the specific nitrite and ammonium oxidation rates, specific nitrate reduction and oxygen uptake rates, sludge volume index increases with reduction in HRT from 17-9 h. However, the diversity indices of microbial community decreased from 2.69-2.39. HRT increase mostly required under low temperature causes endogenous decay rate, reduced biomass concentration, specific biomass growth rate and yield. During hydrogen production in an ASBR, longer HRT would provoke development of non-hydrogen producing bacteria while shorter HRTs lowers H2 yield. This contradicts the findings reported by (Abd Nasir et al., 2019) where low HRT significantly boost the performance of the ASBR in producing biomethane. Continuous shortening of the HRT can further deteriorate the system productivity by biomass washout of active bacteria and decrease in microbial population.HRT is an essential property during biological wastewater and hydrogen production process due to its of its substrate uptake efficiency and ability to determine the economics of hydrogen production process (Shariati et al., 2011).

        <p>SRT is a significant design and operating parameter for activated sludge processes used to control process parameters. These include: nitrification, effluent water quality, wasted sludge volume, oxygen demand and growing status (S. N. Xu et al., 2014). It represents the average amount of time that an organism spends within a bioreactor. To maintain an organism in a bioreactor, its net growth rate should be equal or more than the SRT. Thus, bioreactors with higher SRT should maintain higher diversity of bacterial community. Mathematically, SRT can be determined using the following equation:SRT is a significant design and operating parameter for activated sludge processes used to control process parameters.

SRT may be used for microbial community shift in BNR systems. With SRT increase, it took much longer time to attain high nitritation rates. Relatively short SRT will reduce nitrification start-up time. Nitrite accumulating rate (NAR) is mostly higher at shorter SRT. Operating an SBR at different SRTs can lead to diversity in floc morphology. Irregular sludge flocs morphology is usually found at low SRTs. Possible notable variation in the effluent SS level of is expected for different SRTs. The sludge's flocculating ability varies with respect to SRT. The better flocculating ability of sludge at higher SRTs are due to a far more hydrophobic and less negatively charged surface while irregular floc morphology is due to the restriction of both substrate and oxygen diffusion (Liao et al., 2006). Effluent treated at lower SRTs presented higher SS concentration and vice-versa. TSS and turbidity levels in lower SRTs are also said to be higher than that in longer SRTs.

It can be seen that the continuous reduction in cycle time contributed to an increase in the structure of biomass resulting from a more abundant organic fraction (Scheumann &amp; Kraume, 2009). At short cycle duration, increased P removal was experienced Which can be linked to a greater percentage of N being removed via nitrite pathway that makes biodegradable C more accessible for Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR). But as the cycle duration is increased, the system experienced reduction in P removal efficiency because the demand for denitrification of biodegradable organic C rises with total nitrification (Ginige, Kayaalp, Cheng, Wylie, &amp; Kaksonen, 2013).The effect of the cycle duration has been seldom investigated.

        <p>Feed duratiom: has a greater effect than the tF/tC ratio, because it is critical in determining feed strategy. Long feed times (tF/tC &gt; 0.5) affects system performance linked to extra-cellular polymer synthesis, organic matter removal efficiency and settleability characteristics. Operating an SBR at low (tF/tC) for higher loads, pollutant degradation efficiency decreased by &gt; 25%. (Bezerra et al., 2009) observed that longer feeding periods resulted in reduced volatile acid accumulation. Changes in feed length throughout the cycle alter the substrate gradients: systems with fast feed are distinguished by strong gradients as substrate gradients are less sharp in slow feed systems. It should be noted that, the presence or absence of substrate gradients in a reactor system can have major effects on substrate absorption, storage rates of the developed biomass and settleability (Dionisi, Majone, Levantesi, Bellani, &amp; Fuoco, 2006). Furthermore, systems with fast feed are characterized by superior settling features than slow-feed systems. This is true, though, even if filamentous microorganism has no role to play. Feed strategy: The way the reactor is fed, i.e., pulse vs. continuous feeding modes. One of the most favorable approaches used to solve loading problems in batch mode systems is feed strategy modification. The feeding strategy impact on the substrate removal mechanism was much higher than on the microbial composition. Pulse and continuous feeding operate under conditions that favor internal storage and direct microbial growth. As reported by (Ciggin, Rossetti, Majone, &amp; Orhon, 2012), pulse vs. continuous feeding did not induce substantial change in the biomass dominant bacteria. The study also confirmed that acetate removal was much quicker under pulse feeding conditions than continuous feeding. Reactors operating at pulse feeding modes attained stability and higher efficiency for treating organic wastewater in a higher organic loading condition.Feed duratiom: has a greater effect than the tF/tC ratio, because it is critical in determining feed strategy.

        <p>MLSS is the combination of certain amount of suspended solid mixed with incoming wastewater. MLSS concentration is a key operational variable for SBR technology that directly affects effluent quality. Thus, should be regularly monitored. MLSS is a highly complex parameter as high value results in sludge bulking making the treatment system less efficient due to the non-settled biomass within the effluent wastewater while low value leads to energy wasting with consequential effect of discharging poor effluent. P in wastewater can be significantly accumulated in MLSS but can be removed by sludge wasting. The effect of MLSS on simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in a SBR was investigated by (S. N. Xu et al., 2014). The average removal efficiencies of COD and TN increased from 93 and 68.21% to 97 and 74.20% as MLSS increases in MLSS from 3.5-4.0 to 7.5-8.0 g/L, respectively. Although NH4 + -N removal efficiency decreased, SND efficiency significantly increased with the increase in MLSS. Batch tests suggested that there was a strong potential to apply high MLSS for treating wastewater containing high strength ammonia nitrogen. This contradicts the findings by (Alattabi, Harris, Alkhaddar, Ortoneda-Pedrola, &amp; Alzeyadi, 2019) where effluent quality significantly drops under high concentrations of MLSS. Other parameters not sufficiently discussed due to insufficient information from literature include: recirculation, idle time, volumetric exchange ratio (VER) ratio between substrate and biomass concentration, reactor geometric configuration and characteristics, organic loading rate etc.MLSS is the combination of certain amount of suspended solid mixed with incoming wastewater.

        <p>A number of modified approaches to biological nitrogen removal includes completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX), oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrificationdenitrification (OLAND), simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) via nitrite, simultaneous nitrificationanammox-denitrification (SNAD), single reactor system for high activity ammonium removal over nitrite (SHARON) and deammonification (DEMON) (Arun, Manikandan, Pakshirajan, &amp; Pugazhenthi, 2019). These technologies as further discussed with their advantages and disadvantages in Table 8 have been used to economically treat wastewater heavily concentrated with ammonium and are suggested to reduce DO and organic carbon source requirements for nitrogen removal. They differ in the operating conditions and devices for controlling microbial communities which drive de-ammonification (Shao, Yang, Mohammed, &amp; Liu, 2018). Some of these mechanisms are impaired by the long start-up duration because of the AnAOB's slow growth rate that has a doubling time of 7-14 days.A number of modified approaches to biological nitrogen removal includes completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX), oxygen-limited autotrophic nitrificationdenitrification (OLAND), simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) via nitrite, simultaneous nitrificationanammox-denitrification (SNAD), single reactor system for high activity ammonium removal over nitrite (SHARON) and deammonification (DEMON) (Arun, Manikandan, Pakshirajan, &amp; Pugazhenthi, 2019).

        <p>To intensively improve the conventional sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), different strategies have been developed. These strategies include: algal-bacterial symbiosis, quorum sensing, cometabolism, augmentation, biougmentation and granulation. Optimization algorithm are usually studied for these new strategies for better performance. Most of these strategies highlighted in Table 9 focus on feed distribution, biofilm formation and regulation, interactions among inter-and intra-species, transition of flocs to granules, mediating the production and component of EPS, rapid startup of the SBR reactor. Physicochemical forces (hydrodynamic force, gravity force, etc.) and biological forces (production of extracellular polymer, growth of bacteria clusters, etc.) play significant roles in these strategies (J. F. Wang et al., 2018). Additionally, they can accelerate the acclimation period for biological treatment systems, allow microbes to biodegrade a wide range of refractory organics and built a growing environment for functional dominant bacteria (Kuang et al., 2018). These bacteria could achieve good degradation of contaminant and its derivatives. According to literature, these strategies could improve microbial community sustenance, sludge properties, nitrifiers activity, biodiesel yield of aerobic granules, the production of well settling biomass with reasonable SVI, capacity of the system to withstand high toxic shocks and mitigate their effects, substantially reduce aeration requirements during treatment (Meng et al., 2019). They also have the potential to enhance enzymatic activity and granule cultivation, avoid biomass washout, accelerate the sedimentation process of cells, increase non-growth substrates elimination rate and allow simultaneous removal of contaminants Interestingly, these strategies pave way for SBR to be developed into a promising, sustainable and cost effective technology giving rise to less by-products (Y.

The result proved that under high concentrations, activities of the activated sludge microorganisms is affected due to toxicity resulting to failure of the PN process (L. Q. Zhang et al., 2019).

        <p>Membranes are a physical barrier to suspended solids that are larger than the membrane pore size. Sedimentation and decantation phases of a typical SBR cycle can be replaced by membrane filtration. These reduces the cycle length, removes coliform bacteria and SS, avoid the formation of byproducts, thus providing higher quality effluent (Arrojo et al., 2005). However, membrane fouling is still a problem which depend on factors to include membrane material type, property and composition. Thus, the use of emerging new materials with pressure control potential is another way to mitigate fouling. Studies revealed that membrane fouling can be mitigated by either optimizing membrane operating conditions or preparing antifouling membranes.Membranes are a physical barrier to suspended solids that are larger than the membrane pore size.

        <p>Biofilms are assemblages of microbial populations embedded in an EPS matrix on carriers with a three-dimensional and more complex structure, in which different functional microbial communities are located in different spaces (Zhou &amp; Xu, 2019). They are a convenient way to keep functional bacteria in water treatment systems (Al-dhawi, Kutty, Almahbashi, Noor, &amp; Jagaba). Biofilm performance is determined by thickness and density which are a function of adopted biofilm support media. Biofilm carriers can provide a suitable environment for simultaneous aerobic and anoxic metabolic activity. They are suitable for denitrification, shock resistant and most commonly less energy consumption (Gonzalez, Esplugas, Sans, Torres, &amp; Esplugas, 2009). They are characterized by smaller foot-print, higher HRT, high organic matter and nitrogen removal rate, less growth of excess biomass and require lower operational costs. Biofilm limitation during phosphorus removal is the efficient removal of phosphorus-rich biomass from the reactor and the mass transfer of DO (Zhan, Rodgers, &amp; O'Reilly, 2006).Biofilms are assemblages of microbial populations embedded in an EPS matrix on carriers with a three-dimensional and more complex structure, in which different functional microbial communities are located in different spaces (Zhou &amp; Xu, 2019).

Their potential biotoxicity has generated significant concern in recent times as it can have adverse effects on microbial growth and can induce oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in human cells (Ma et al., 2019). On the other hand, CNTs have strong hydrophilicity and polarity which can encourage their potential for high water and wastewater dispersion (M. C. Gao et al., 2019). They can be used when treating wastewater as adsorbent, composite, antimicrobial agent, catalyst carrier and filtering media. CNTs can gather with biofilm and activated sludge due to their high hydrophobicity. The antimicrobial property of CNTs can alter the performance of the bioreactor. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the possible impact of different CNTs on bioreactor efficiency 4.4.9 Nanoparticles (NPs) Carbon-based NPs are extensively used and thus, their global production is continuously increasing. Metal oxide NPs discharged into the environment could ultimately enter biological wastewater treatment systems. They could inhibit the organic matter and phosphorus removals, nitrification and denitrification of bioreactors treating wastewater (S.

Due to their small size and large specific surface area, NPs exhibit optical, electrical, and chemical characteristics different from either their bulk or dissolved forms. Scientists have shown that large quantities of NPs can be adsorptively eliminated from wastewater during treatment. Depending on the type and property of NPs, the adsorbed ones could decrease microbial populations, disturb microbial diversity, reduce hazardous substances, adsorb heavy metals and lead to a reduction in efficiency. An important application of NPs is to utilize the electron-donating capacity of nanometals to stimulate microbial growth and activity.

It exists when an SBR is coupled or modified with either a moving or fix support material thereby combining the advantages of the SBR and the modified or coupled material. Some notable generic advantages are: ability to grow different types of bacteria, greater biomass retention, volumetric efficiency, better resistance to inhibitory effects, low footprint, cost reduction (da Costa, Souto, Prelhaz, Neto, &amp; Wolff, 2008), low energy requirements, stability and resistance to shock loads. The specific advantages for various hybrid configurations have been highlighted in Table 11. Furthermore, the performance of a hybrid SBR depends on the nature of modification carried out as different modification materials, methods and conditions offer variable properties to the system.Hybrid SBR is an innovative novel configured system enhanced over the conventional SBR.

        <p>Pressurized aeration is a method used to improve oxygen transfer momentum. The pressurized activated sludge process enhances the solubility of oxygen by increasing total air pressure, with a result of promoted oxygen transfer rate. Activated sludge and biofilm with pressurized aeration technology are said to be more effective than those in traditional aeration systems. Degradation rate of organic matters could be dramatically increased when activated sludge process is running under high organic load by effectively reducing aeration tank volume and hydraulic detention time through the application of pressurized aeration. Pressurized unit could obtain a substantial saving, especially when the treatment process is for larger populations. There is a general tendency of microbial growth inhibition under high pressure of several hundred bars. These pressures could inactivate and eliminate microorganisms, and consequently provide a longer storage time for various materials and food. However, the effects of high pressure are not of relevance to industrial aerobic bioreactors, where the moderate pressure is often controlled to less than 1.0 MPa. Moderate pressures have been demonstrated to cause no damage to several culture processes (Y. Zhang et al., 2017). Results in a study by (Elkaramany, Elbaz, Mohamed, &amp; Sakr, 2018) revealed that the use of recycled pressurized air in the pressurized SBR increased the contact time between air bubbles and wastewater threefold compared with the conventional SBR model and increased the rate of DO in wastewater.Pressurized aeration is a method used to improve oxygen transfer momentum.

        <p>Aerobic granular sludge is the biomass aggregates grown under aerobic conditions without a carrier material (He, Zhang, Zou, Zheng, &amp; Wang, 2016). Aerobic granular sludge possesses regular and dense physical structure, regular morphology, impact microbial structure, and great ability to withstand shock load and toxic compounds. It has severally been reported that Aerobic granules might disintegrate after prolonged operation due to overloading, hydrolysis of the anaerobic core, unbalanced substrates, inappropriate operational configurations, loss of functional strains, intrusion of stressing compounds, outgrowth of filamentous organisms, and secretion of EPS. However, strategies such as the selection of a slow-growing organism, suppressing activity of anaerobes, application of appropriate operational conditions and strengthening granule were identified for developing more stable granules. Nitrification, denitrification and TN removal rate could be influenced by anoxic and aerobic volumes built-up by DO penetration in the single granules. Biomass spatial distribution, activity of diverse bacteria species and granule size and density are responsible for DO diffusion in granules (F. Y. Chen et al., 2011). On the contrary, high salinity and low temperature negatively affects aerobic granular sludge performance and stability (He et al., 2020).Aerobic granular sludge is the biomass aggregates grown under aerobic conditions without a carrier material (He, Zhang, Zou, Zheng, &amp; Wang, 2016).

The system is extensively used in treating low strength wastewater. Biosorption and biodegradation are the major mechanisms for pollutant removal in the IFAS-SBR system. Thus, creating favorable conditions for denitrifiers and modifying reaction and settling time are said to promote nitrate removal (Shao et al., 2018). Compared to fixed media, mobile media facilitates high oxygen and nutrient transfer in reactors.

        <p>Ultrasonic process considered as a new technology for high rate biological wastewater treatment processes is defined as acoustic or sound waves with frequencies above natural human hearing limit (&gt;20 kHz). Interestingly, ultrasonic parameters (e.g. irradiation cycle, frequency, intensity, proportion and time) are vital (Jin et al., 2013). Ultrasound application in SBR is a huge adventure for successful and cost-effective biological treatment. It is able to eradicate contaminants by generating radicals in the cavitation bubble. The impact of ultrasound waves on liquid causes the periodical compression and rarefaction of the medium (Neczaj et al., 2005). Ultrasonic wave frequency has a clear effect on the diameter of the produced bubbles. High frequency ultrasound generating smaller and more stable bubbles under high concentration of biomass and remarkably increasing effect on sludge settling velocity without adverse consequence on microbial activity made biological system more stable. Low ultrasonic frequency (20-100 kHz) produces stronger hydrodynamic shear forces. Thus, sludge destabilization occurs at this level. Ultrasound irradiation at low intensity can be used in biological materials because it can improve the activity of enzymes, increase the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells, improve the permeability of cell membrane, promote cell growth and biosynthesis, and waste products transfer away from the cells, thus improving microbial cells operation and development (Zinadini, Rahimi, Zinatizadeh, &amp; Mehrabadi, 2015). For excess sludge reduction, several researchers employed (&lt;100 Hz) and (&lt;2W/cm 2 ) as low frequency and intensity respectively. It was discovered that, sludge floc agglomerates were spread without cell destruction at short ultrasound application time. However, the microbial cell wall was weakened and intracellular materials released to the liquid phase at longer treatment time or higher ultrasound intensities (R. N. Zhang, Jin, Liu, Zhou, &amp; Li, 2011). In the case of raw landfill leachate, ultrasonic pretreatment boosts subsequent aerobic digestion, amounting to better degradation while sonification leads to enhancement of ammonia and COD removal at all influent leachate percentage addition as reported by (Grosser et al., 2019). This may be attributed to the fact that the medium 's periodic compression and rarefaction are caused by an ultrasonic wave in liquid.Ultrasonic process considered as a new technology for high rate biological wastewater treatment processes is defined as acoustic or sound waves with frequencies above natural human hearing limit (&gt;20 kHz).

        <p>The arbitrary disposal of waste at landfill sites can lead to uncontrollable displacement of leachate through the soil, surface water, and sometimes groundwater which poses a major public health environmental threat resulting from its constituents toxic and recalcitrant nature. Thus, regulations require the treatment of hazardous leachate components before discharge in order to avoid polluting water supplies and put off serious and permanent toxicity. The basic difficulty in leachate treatment is the selection of combined reasonable, economical, and efficient processes and technologies. This is due its high-strength organic content, complex chemical structure, variable composition and seasonally diverse volume. Currently, there is no single widely acceptable method documented for proper treatment of leachate as conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot achieve a satisfactory level for degrading toxic substances present. Numerous techniques have been put in during leachate degradation, showing different degrees of effectiveness. Therefore, this article presented a comprehensive review of existing research articles on the merits and demerits of various adopted methods. The article stressed on the application and efficiency of SBR system treating landfill leachate. The article further analyzed the effect of different materials, processes, strategies and configurations on leachate treatment. Environmental and operational parameters that affect SBR system were critically discussed.The arbitrary disposal of waste at landfill sites can lead to uncontrollable displacement of leachate through the soil, surface water, and sometimes groundwater which poses a major public health environmental threat resulting from its constituents toxic and recalcitrant nature.

        <p>This study, however, note the following:  There is a definitive relationship between efficacy of the treatment and environmental/operational parameters as they highly influence the performance of the SBR system. These can be ascertained by observing their influence on biological dephosphatation, nitrification and denitrification, impact on the microbial community structure and population, granulation, toxicity, biofilm formation, substrate storage and utilization. They also help in understanding floc structure, properties, and mechanisms of bioflocculation.  The efficiency and effect of individual materials under short-and long-term exposures depends on the correlation between the material and leachate age and condition. Adding composite adsorbents and plastic media into the reactor, remarkably increase biofilm formation and regulation, specific reactor surface area with improved contaminant removal.  The improvement of the conventional SBRs involved the development of different strategies such as algalbacterial symbiosis, quorum sensing, cometabolism, augmentation. These strategies have the potential to withstand high toxic shocks and mitigate their effects, accelerate the acclimation period for the system, allow microbes to degrade a wide range of refractory organics and built a growing environment for functional dominant bacteria, enhance enzymatic activity and granule cultivation, avoid biomass washout, accelerate the sedimentation process of cells, mediate the production of EPS, substantially reduce aeration requirements and allow simultaneous removal of contaminants. Interestingly, these strategies pave way for SBR to be developed into a promising, sustainable and cost-effective technology giving rise to less by-products.  The performance of a hybrid SBR depends on the nature of modification carried out as different modification materials, methods and conditions offer variable properties to the system. They have been proven for rapid startup of the reactor, low energy requirements, greater biomass retention, better resistance to inhibitory effects, ability to grow different types of bacteria, volumetric efficiency, low footprint, stability and resistance to shock loads  Optimization algorithm are usually studied for new materials, strategies, processes, and configurations for better performance. Going by this, authors suggests the application of molecular docking simulation to identify the binding interactions between pollutants and materials (adsorbents, nanoparticles, membranes, biofilters, biofilm carriers etc) and the energy of which a molecule is attached to a specific receptor site.This study, however, note the following:  There is a definitive relationship between efficacy of the treatment and environmental/operational parameters as they highly influence the performance of the SBR system.
