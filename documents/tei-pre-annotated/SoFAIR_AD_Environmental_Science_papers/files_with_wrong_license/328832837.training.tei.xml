        <p>Abstract: To effectively cope with the impacts of climate change, people will need to adapt and potentially transform. Recent research has highlighted that people's adaptive capacity, which may enable both adaptation and transformation, is comprised of six key domains: assets, flexibility, organization, learning, socio-cognitive constructs, and agency. However, no empirical studies have simultaneously examined how all six adaptive capacity domains are related to both adaptive and transformative actions. Drawing on novel advances in multilevel network modelling, we provide evidence consistent with an influence process in which aspects of social organization (exposure to others in social networks) encourage both adaptive and transformative action among Papua New Guinean islanders experiencing climate change impacts. Adaptive and transformative action are also related to socialecological network structures between people and ecological resources that enable learning and the internalization of ecological feedbacks. Agency is also key, yet we show that while perceived power may encourage adaptations, it may discourage more transformative actions. &lt;Introduction&gt; Climate change is already affecting the lives of people across the globe. Even under the most optimistic greenhouse gas emission reduction scenario in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report 1 , securing biodiversity and ecosystem services, safeguarding food and water security, and protecting the livelihoods and health of future generations presents significant challenges. As sea levels rise and global heating triggers an increase in climate-related disasters, it is imperative that people on the frontlines of climate change have the capacity to effectively respond in ways that reduce their vulnerability 2 .Abstract: To effectively cope with the impacts of climate change, people will need to adapt and potentially transform.

        <p>Whether and how people respond to environmental change (adaptive behaviour) is widely recognized to be driven by their adaptive capacity, broadly defined as 'the underlying conditions that enable people to anticipate and respond to change, to minimize the consequences, to recover, and to take advantage of new opportunities' 3 . Access to capital, such as financial assets, has long been considered a crucial determinant of adaptive capacity 3,4 . However, research from across diverse social science disciplines has recently identified a much broader range of determinants that underpin whether and how people adapt to environmental change [5][6][7][8] . Following this research 5,6 , we categorize these determinants into six broad domains: assets, flexibility, organization, learning, sociocognitive constructs, and agency (Fig. 1). These six domains highlight that in addition to assets, adaptive behaviour can be driven by whether people have the flexibility to change strategies 6 , and the power or agency to influence change 9 and make their own free choices in determining whether to change or not 10 . Socio-cognitive constructs, such as risk attitudes (how people perceive and deal with risk), cognitive biases (e.g., fatalistic attitudes), and personal experience, can also play an important role on people's adaptive behaviour 7,8 . For example, decisions regarding whether and how to respond to changing environmental conditions can be driven by perceptions of the probability and severity of risk associated with change 11 as well as the closeness and intensity of previous related experiences 12 . Finally, adaptive behaviour can be influenced by the social and social-ecological ties binding people to each other and the environment 13,14 , as these relationships shape the social and environmental context (organization) in which people experience, learn to recognize, and respond to climate change (Fig. 1).Whether and how people respond to environmental change (adaptive behaviour) is widely recognized to be driven by their adaptive capacity, broadly defined as 'the underlying conditions that enable people to anticipate and respond to change, to minimize the consequences, to recover, and to take advantage of new opportunities' 3 .

        <p>Together, these emerging insights offer a more comprehensive perspective of a multitude of interrelated factors that may underpin responses to environmental change across diverse contexts. Yet two key gaps remain: first, most studies focus on how people's adaptive behaviours may be influenced by a single domain of adaptive capacity, rather than simultaneously examining the six domains outlined above. Which domains should be prioritized in policies and programs aimed at reducing climate vulnerabilities 7,8 is therefore unclear, despite substantial interest and ongoing investments in building adaptive capacity among local and national governments, non-governmental organizations, and development agencies 6,19 . Second, much of the existing work on the relationship between adaptive capacity and adaptive behaviour has relied on hypothetical or intended responses to future impacts, rather than people's actual responses to change 7 . As a result, our understanding of how diverse domains of adaptive capacity simultaneously interact to shape realized responses to climate change remains limited 8 .Together, these emerging insights offer a more comprehensive perspective of a multitude of interrelated factors that may underpin responses to environmental change across diverse contexts.

        <p>Here, we sought to understand how diverse domains of adaptive capacity drive varied household-level (recall) responses to climate change among a population (N = 138 of 140 households) on a tropical island in Papua New Guinea (Fig. 2, Methods). Our study context is characteristic of many coastal and island communities across the global tropics in that (a) the majority of households are primarily dependent on fishing and harvesting marine resources (particularly coral reef-associated resources) for livelihoods and food security, and (b) the island is highly vulnerable to, and is indeed already experiencing the impacts of climate change; such as sea-level rise, coastal inundation and erosion 20 , and disruptions to reef ecosystems and associated fisheries 21 . In this context, we integrate a full population census, semi-structured social surveys, key informant and expert interviews, observed fish landings, and published reports to document adaptive behaviours (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1) and develop 20 key indicators (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 23; Fig. 3) representing the six broad domains of adaptive capacity, i.e., assets, flexibility, learning, organization, socio-cognitive constructs, and agency (Fig. 1). Our indicators included social and economic characteristics, such as wealth and risk perceptions ( 3). Building on recent advances in network methodology (Autologistic Actor Attribute Models 22 ), we then developed a multilevel social-ecological network modelling approach that enabled us to predict adaptive behaviour (Supplementary Table 1) as a function of a household's adaptive capacity (Methods, Supplementary Methods).Here, we sought to understand how diverse domains of adaptive capacity drive varied household-level (recall) responses to climate change among a population (N = 138 of 140 households) on a tropical island in Papua New Guinea (Fig. 2, Methods).

        <p>(2) transformative action (Fig. 2). A large body of work describes climate change adaptation as comprising a diversity of responses ranging from minor/moderate or incremental changes to existing practices and behaviours (often referred to as 'incremental adaptation', or simply 'adaptation'), to more fundamental changes that have the potential to create a new system or future (often referred to as 'transformational adaptation', or simply 'transformation') [31][32][33][34] .(2) transformative action (Fig. 2).

        <p>Yet debate remains regarding these concepts and when an action should be considered transformative as opposed to adaptive 32 . Following recent theoretical and empirical work in this area 31,[34][35][36] , we defined adaptive actions as changes to existing practices or behaviours which allow existing social-ecological system structures to absorb, accommodate, or embrace change; and transformative actions as more fundamental changes that can alter dominant social-ecological relationships and contribute toward the creation of a new system and/or future. Adaptive actions in this case included a range of behaviours such as technological fixes/mitigation (such as building sea walls, which in this case were considered adaptive in nature because the walls were built to protect existing land uses and they did not require major engineering projects), adapting or intensifying fishing practices and effort, and seeking knowledge/creating awareness about climate change (Fig. 2, Methods, Supplementary Table 1). Transformative actions included livelihood diversification that represented a fundamental departure from near complete dependence on traditional marine resource-based activities (i.e., engaging in atoll farming; Fig. 2, Methods, Supplementary Methods), and active engagement in long-term planning specifically aimed at managing climate change impacts on the community (e.g., developing novel community response plans and/or resettlement schemes, which in this case represented a departure from more general community planning which occurs regularly; Supplementary Table 1, Methods). Both adaptive and transformative action are thought to be underpinned by adaptive capacity 31 , yet the majority of the empirical work on adaptive capacity and responses to climate change has focused on adaptive action. Thus, a key unanswered question which we in part aim to address here is whether different (or the same) capacities and domains of adaptive capacity are needed to enable transformative action.Yet debate remains regarding these concepts and when an action should be considered transformative as opposed to adaptive 32 .

        <p>We found that three key domains of adaptive capacity crosscut both adaptive and transformative action: organization, learning, and agency. First, we found that network exposure -related to the organization domain of adaptive capacity (Table 1, Fig. 3) -played a key role on both adaptive and transformative action (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5).We found that three key domains of adaptive capacity crosscut both adaptive and transformative action: organization, learning, and agency.

        <p>Social networks have long been identified as a source of social capital that can act to support adaptation in the context of climate change (e.g., by providing access to resources and social support 13 ), yet existing research has generally not considered the prospect of them having a more direct relationship with adaptive behaviour via network exposure.Social networks have long been identified as a source of social capital that can act to support adaptation in the context of climate change (e.g., by providing access to resources and social support 13 ), yet existing research has generally not considered the prospect of them having a more direct relationship with adaptive behaviour via network exposure.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, none of our network measures that are characteristic of social capital were significant in our model (e.g., connectivity, linking ties; Fig. 3); while network exposure was (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5).Interestingly, none of our network measures that are characteristic of social capital were significant in our model (e.g., connectivity, linking ties; Fig. 3); while network exposure was (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5).</p>
        <p>'Network exposure' captures social processes that result in observed 'homophily', which is the propensity for like-minded people to be connected 37 . There are two ways to interpret our network exposure term: (1) social influence, whereby households are influenced by those they are exposed to in their social networks; and (2) social selection (also referred to as 'choice homophily'), whereby households preferentially choose to interact with households similar to themselves (i.e., like attracts like). An analysis of a subset of the social networks examined here from two distinct time periods shows that some communication partners and key social nodes (i.e., highly connected respondents) in our study community remain stable over time (Supplementary Methods). This suggests that our network exposure effect is likely capturing some degree of social influence (i.e., households are influenced by the adaptive and/or transformative behaviour of their network partners). Yet the full effect is likely a combination of social influence and social selection, which are known to co-occur 38 . Thus, our result that network exposure is significantly correlated with adaptive and transformative action (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5), indicates that adaptive behaviour is being reinforced, either through the formation of new ties (selection) or the changing attitudes in existing ties (influence). This result represents an example of cultural change 39,40 in response to climate change. Our results thus lend some weight to recent calls for the development and implementation of social influence approaches that use the power of networks to catalyse action in response to climate change 8 . Such approaches have proven to be successful in reducing bullying in classrooms 41 , and our results suggest they may help to encourage adaptive and transformative action among those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Caution in warranted in applying social influence approaches however, as some literature has shown that the co-occurrence of social influence and social selection can lead to segmented networks and polarization 38,40 , where behaviours and opinions are divided amongst contrasting groups. Importantly, increasing polarization may create challenges for coordinating larger-scale (e.g., community-wide) adaptive and transformative action over time.'Network exposure' captures social processes that result in observed 'homophily', which is the propensity for like-minded people to be connected 37 .

        <p>Our second key result is that social-ecological network structures supporting the learning domain of adaptive capacity played a critical role on both of our studied responses. Specifically, socially linked households with many ties to divergent resources were more likely to have adapted than those linked to interconnected resources (combined effects of open social-ecological square and closed social-ecological square, Fig. 3; Supplementary Methods); whereas households directly linked to interconnected ecological resources (ecological-social triangle) were more likely to have transformed (Fig. 3; Table 2, Supplementary Tables 5 and6). People are known to learn through different types of interaction and experience, both with the environment and with peers 30 . Our results indicate that social learning involving many independent resources (in this case households sharing and building knowledge with each other about several different fish species and potentially their different ecosystem functions and/or parts of the ecosystem they inhabit) may contribute understanding about broader ecological trends, thereby prompting households to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In contrast, our results suggest that knowledge built through personal connections with interconnected resources (personal learning about trophically linked fish species in this case) may enable people to internalize ecological feedbacks 29 , catalysing more transformative action in response to environmental change.Our second key result is that social-ecological network structures supporting the learning domain of adaptive capacity played a critical role on both of our studied responses.

        <p>Given the complex, micro-level interactions likely to be occurring between two interlinked species, such ecological knowledge is likely gained through personal experience built up over years of observation and reflection 28 , and people may not be consciously aware of it or how it impacts their behaviour 8 .Given the complex, micro-level interactions likely to be occurring between two interlinked species, such ecological knowledge is likely gained through personal experience built up over years of observation and reflection 28 , and people may not be consciously aware of it or how it impacts their behaviour 8 .</p>
        <p>Our third key result provides evidence that perceived power -a key indicator of agencyplays a critical role when it comes to encouraging, or discouraging, adaptive behaviour. Specifically, we found that households that felt they had power or influence over decisions about marine resources (the primary source of income and food) were more likely to adapt, but less likely to transform (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 5 and6). Moreover, power played a disproportionate role on the adaptive behaviour of households with less exposure to others who had taken action in response to climate change (Fig. 4, Methods, Supplementary Methods). By definition, transformative action supports moves to reorder social-ecological relationships, thereby challenging existing structures 31,34,36 . Yet people can be resistant to fundamental change, particularly those in powerful positions who may stand to lose from such changes, which often involve shifts in power 8,36 . Our results thus critically underscore the importance of carefully considering the role of local power dynamics in shaping responses to climate change, as these dynamics can affect the ability of people, communities, and entire social-ecological systems to deal with dramatic change which may require more fundamental action extending beyond what is typically understood as adaptive in order to sustain livelihoods and ecosystems 14,36 . Surprisingly, we found that none of our indicators of flexibility or financial assets were significantly related to adaptive or transformative action (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 5 and6). In line with recent research highlighting the important, yet often overlooked role of socio-cognitive constructs in supporting adaptive behaviour 7,8 , we also found that perceptions of past experience with more severe impacts were significantly related to adaptive action. Yet neither of our indicators of the socio-cognitive domain were significantly related to transformative action. Developing a better understanding of when and how transformative action may be shaped by past experience, and other socio-cognitive factors like risk perception, is an area ripe for future research.Our third key result provides evidence that perceived power -a key indicator of agencyplays a critical role when it comes to encouraging, or discouraging, adaptive behaviour.

        <p>Financial assets have long been emphasized as a crucial component of adaptive capacity 3,4 . As such, many adaptation programs have focused heavily on building financial assets as well as fostering the flexibility for people, households, and communities to adjust to current and future changes 6,42 . By simultaneously examining six domains of adaptive capacity, we show that adaptation programs that focus heavily on building financial assets could benefit extensively if they accounted for the organization, learning, and agency domains of adaptive capacity. Case studies, such as ours of a Papua New Guinean tropical island community, are critical to building the evidence base on complex social-ecological interactions and how they relate to human behaviour 43 . We therefore believe our results are likely to be of wide interest and may have relevance to other similar contexts. Indeed, many island communities around the globe, particularly across the tropics, face similar climate change challenges and need the capacity to adapt. In this context, our results suggest that harnessing the influence of networks, facilitating individual and social learning, and carefully considering power dynamics could add considerable value to existing approaches aimed at reducing climate vulnerabilities.Financial assets have long been emphasized as a crucial component of adaptive capacity 3,4 .

        <p>1 Methods Summary of empirical strategy. This research was conducted in a low-lying coral island in the Manus province of Papua New Guinea. The island is home to a population of approximately 700 people living in 140 households. To understand responses to climate change in this context, we collected a combination of quantitative and qualitative interdisciplinary data including a full population census, semi-structured social surveys with household heads as representatives of their household (N = 138 out of 140 households), key informant interviews (N = 3), and observed fish landings. We also constructed full socialecological networks akin to Fig. 3A using information from our census, semi-structured surveys, fish landings data, expert knowledge, and published reports. Using this information, we employed novel multilevel network modelling methods in order to simultaneously test how adaptive and transformative action were shaped by twenty key indicators of six broad domains of adaptive capacity, including a household's position in a complex socialecological network and the behaviour of other households in the network (i.e., network exposure 25 ). The census, surveys, and interviews were conducted from May -June 2018 in the local language.1 Methods Summary of empirical strategy.

        <p>Responses to climate change. A broad understanding of responses to climate change among island households was gained via key informant interviews. We captured specific household-level responses in our semi-structured surveys by pooling information from two questions: (1) we directly asked households whether they had made any changes in response to the impacts of climate change; and if so, we asked them to recall what those changes were; and (2) we asked about specific livelihood activities that brought food or money into the household. (2) was included because key informants identified atoll farming as a response to climate change, which was initially introduced on the island by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in 2017 as an alternate food and income source (see 44 ). Historically there had been little to no engagement in agriculture due to land shortages and poor soil quality, and the island community had been almost entirely dependent on fishing and related activities. Responses were coded as adaptive and/or transformative following the definitions in the main text (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and2 for a summary and descriptive statistics of identified responses). We gathered additional information directly from TNC about how atoll farming was introduced on the island in order to ensure it did not introduce any bias into our results. We found that many who were initially trained in atoll farming methods through the TNC initiative (6 months prior to our fieldwork) either did not adopt and/or continue the practice; yet the activity spread well beyond those initially trained (Supplementary Methods). Importantly, attending a training session was not meaningfully correlated with our transformative action variable (r = 0.15) nor was it is significant (p = 0.12) in a binary logistic regression on our transformative action variable that included our social and economic indicators of adaptive capacity (Table 1, Supplementary Methods).Responses to climate change.

(2) was included because key informants identified atoll farming as a response to climate change, which was initially introduced on the island by The Nature Conservancy (TNC) in 2017 as an alternate food and income source (see 44 ). Historically there had been little to no engagement in agriculture due to land shortages and poor soil quality, and the island community had been almost entirely dependent on fishing and related activities. Responses were coded as adaptive and/or transformative following the definitions in the main text (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and2 for a summary and descriptive statistics of identified responses). We gathered additional information directly from TNC about how atoll farming was introduced on the island in order to ensure it did not introduce any bias into our results. We found that many who were initially trained in atoll farming methods through the TNC initiative (6 months prior to our fieldwork) either did not adopt and/or continue the practice; yet the activity spread well beyond those initially trained (Supplementary Methods). Importantly, attending a training session was not meaningfully correlated with our transformative action variable (r = 0.15) nor was it is significant (p = 0.12) in a binary logistic regression on our transformative action variable that included our social and economic indicators of adaptive capacity (Table 1, Supplementary Methods).</p>
        <p>Constructing the social-ecological networks. We collected detailed social network data capturing both informal and fishing-related communication relationships between households on the island (i.e., the social network A, Fig. 3). We first conducted a full census of the island. We then asked respondents (the household head, typically male) (1) who they sat and talked with a big community events or gatherings (e.g., church, the weekly soccer game, or community meetings), (2) who the female/other household head sat and talked with at big community events or gatherings (e.g., church, the weekly soccer game, or community meetings), and (3) who they shared important information and advice with about fishing and fishery management (e.g., rules, gears, and fishing locations). The census ensured we were able to link all individuals nominated in the network to specific households.Constructing the social-ecological networks.

        <p>Due to the undirected nature of the communication ties [(1) and ( 2) above], all social ties were symmetrized and treated as undirected, with edges representing communication relationships between household-level nodes (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Methods). We also asked about the relationships households had with external actors (such measurements of housing materials (e.g., types of roofing, walls, and floors) and material assets (e.g., boats, generators, solar panels, and agricultural assets like chickens 47 ). Access to credit was a binary variable measuring whether households had access to credit through formal (i.e. banks and financial institutions) or informal (e.g. friends and family) means. Remittances was a binary variable measuring whether the household receives remittance (cash) payments from family off-island, of any amount or frequency.Due to the undirected nature of the communication ties [(1) and ( 2) above], all social ties were symmetrized and treated as undirected, with edges representing communication relationships between household-level nodes (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Methods).

        <p>(2) Flexibility. We measured technological diversity (i.e. flexibility within fishing livelihoods), occupational multiplicity (i.e. having two or more livelihood options), and the age of household heads. Age of primary decision-makers was included because it has been shown to influence planning horizons, skills, experience 48,49 , behavioural barriers 50 , and the propensity to adopt innovations 51 in ways that influence adaptive strategies 35 . Technological diversity measured the number of different types of fishing gears (e.g. spear gun, net) owned by a household 15 . Occupational multiplicity was the total number of livelihood activities that brought food or money into the household (with the exception of atoll farming, which was captured as one of our transformative responses).(2) Flexibility.

        <p>(3) Social organization. We measured levels of trust in institutions. We also used four network configurations capturing aspects of social capital (defined here as including networks, norms, and trust 16,17 ) and key social relationships: i. social connectivity (how well connected households were in the social network, which can provide access to information and resources 24 ; Fig. 3b); ii. social-ecological connectivity (which extends the idea of social connectivity to the ecological system 14 ; Fig. 3e); iii. linking ties (ties to external actors, which can provide access to a diversity of information and support 24 ; Fig. 3d), and iv. exposure via network contacts ('network exposure', which can capture effects of social influence 25 and social selection; Fig. 3c). For trust in institutions, we calculated a continuous indicator based on the median of three Likert-scale questions that gauged how much household heads trusted locally-relevant institutional actors (i.e., those who would be responsible for supporting and/or safeguarding adaptive and transformative actions); these were community leaders, local government, and police 15 . Linking ties was a continuous variable capturing the number of relationships the household had with external actors, such as government officials, non-government organizations, and business leaders (Fig. 3d). We used a continuous indicator because as the number of external ties increase, so too does the potential exposure to outside ideas and influence.(3) Social organization.

        <p>(4) Learning. We measured years of formal schooling of household heads (education, which can help train people to learn 52,53 ); and used four network configurations capturing the manner in which households are connected with ecosystems and each other, which can facilitate social and individual learning about ecological states and trends 14 . These were: i. social-ecological triangle (where households linked to the same resource are socially connected, which may facilitate social learning about shared ecological resources 14,26 ; Fig. 3f), ii. ecological-social triangle (where a household is connected to two interdependent resources), which may help to build knowledge about interconnected resources and provide the necessary structural foundation for households to internalize ecological feedbacks 29 , Fig. 3g), iii. socialecological square (where socially connected households are connected to interdependent resources, which may enable social learning about interconnected resources and provide the necessary structural foundation for the internalization of ecological feedbacks 14,29 ; Fig. 3h), and iv. open social-ecological square (which captures linked households with many ties to divergent resources which may facilitate social learning about broader ecological trends 24,30 ; Fig. 3i). These hypothesized configurations were identified in existing literature (e.g., 6,14 ) and further developed through a workshop conducted in 2018. We measured them using structural parameters in our multilevel network model (see 'Modelling procedure' below).(4) Learning.

        <p>(5) Socio-cognitive constructs. We measured both past experience and future risk perceptions because existing research has demonstrated that adaptive behaviour is often positively correlated with the physical closeness and/or intensity of previous related experiences 12 and the perceived severity of future impacts (risk appraisal) 11,54 . Past experience was a binary indicator of previous experience with severe climate change impacts. We used a relative measure based on whether household heads (as representatives of their household) felt they had been impacted by climate change worse than most others in the community (1), compared to whether they felt they had been impacted the same or less than others (0). A relative measure for past impacts was used because research in psychology on risk and social comparison suggests that people often compare their relative standing to others in order to form judgements 55 , and the manner in which people view the impacts of climate change are often socially mediated 56 . Future risk perception was a binary indicator measuring whether households felt that climate change impacts were getting worse (1), compared to staying the same or improving (0).(5) Socio-cognitive constructs.

        <p>(6) Agency. We measured active (involvement) in decision-making and perceived power/influence over decision-making 57 . Active in decision-making was a binary variable measuring whether household heads were actively involved in decisions about marine resources (1), as opposed to only being passively involved (e.g. attended meetings but did not speak) or not involved at all (0). Power/influence was a binary indicator that captured whether household heads felt they had some or lots power/influence over decisions about marine resources (1), or little or no power/influence (0). Modelling procedure. We employed novel multilevel network modelling methods that explicitly account for network dependencies in order to simultaneously test how adaptive and transformative action were shaped by our indicators described above. We took a two-stage approach to our analysis to ensure these models were not overparametrized. Firstly, we ran logistic regression models on adaptive and transformative action including all non-(structural) network indicators of adaptive capacity (indicators 1 -7, 10, and 16 -20 in Table 1). Structural social and social-ecological network effects (i.e., indicators 8 -9 and 11 -15 in Table 1, which are depicted as network configurations in Fig. 3b -c ande -i) could not be included at this stage because they can only be modelled using specific network-based models that account for the structure of the multilevel social-ecological network and the interdependencies among the adaptive or transformative actions of networked actors (households in this case). Linking ties (indicator 10 in Table 1 and depicted in Fig. 3d) was included in the initial logistic regressions because it was measured as continuous covariate (and treated as a node-level attribute), as described above. Results of our logistic regressions are included in Supplementary Table 4. All indicators that were significant at the 10% level were included as candidate predictors in our final multilevel network models. We choose a significance level of 10% in order to reduce the chance that a potentially important indicator was overlooked in our final models. Following this criteria, the following nonstructural network indicators (i.e., node-level attributes) were included in our final multilevel network models: (a) for adaptive action: education, past experience, active in decisionmaking, and power/influence; (b) for transformative action: remittances, age, linking ties, active in decision-making, power/influence. Secondly, in our final models we extended the current functionality of the Autologistic Actor Attribute Model (ALAAM) 22 to account for a complex, multilevel (social-ecological) network structure (Supplementary Methods). ALAAMs model the behaviour of network actors as a function of the network structure and other actor (node-level) attributes (or covariates).(6) Agency.

        <p>Compared with traditional logistic regression, ALAAMs explicitly account for network positions as well as how the behaviour of networked partners may be dependent on one another (i.e., network exposure). For multilevel networks, we used ALAAM to test how the relationships defined in the social and ecological system affected individual household's behaviour, with effects represented by network configurations Fig. 3b, d -i. We label the outcomes or actors who have taken the actions as ( ), the social network as ( ), the ecological network as ( ), meso-level social-ecological interactions as ( ), and other actor attributes (i.e., other non-network indicators of adaptive capacity) as ( ).

            <rs type="software">MPNet</rs> software 59 . Following 60,61 , model convergence and goodness of fit (GOF) tests were assessed using the procedure presented by Koskinen and Snijders 62 , which compares the observed network statistics with simulated samples from the converged model using t-ratios as testing statistics, where t-ratios smaller than 0.1 in scale indicate model convergence. Though this procedure is most commonly known for its application to exponential random graph models (ERGMs), an ALAAM can be considered as a special case of a bipartite ERGM for a n (individual) by 1 (outcome) bipartite network, while using the one-mode n by n network as a covariate 22 . The definitions of the various configurations in ALAAMs and ERGMs can be the same, and the estimation and GOF test techniques applied in ERGMs are equally applicable to ALAAMs 59 , with the deposited in the Tropical Data Hub and can be accessed at {link active upon article acceptance}.

        <p>(1) Assets. We focused on financial assets by measuring wealth, access to credit, and remittances. We used a material style of life index for wealth 46 that included implementation in MPNet sharing the same technical approaches 59 . Supplementary Table 5 presents full model results for our ALAAMs on adaptive and transformative action.(1) Assets.

        <p>Model interpretation. The estimated effects in our ALAAMs can be interpreted as the predominance of various attributes and social-ecological network positions affecting individual household's adaptive behaviour. Using the network exposure effect as an example, it has a positive and significant estimate in both of our final models (Table 2, Supplementary Table 5), suggesting a household is more likely than we would expect at random (given the rest of the model) to have taken adaptive and/or transformative action if they are connected to network partners that have taken similar actions. This is a general statement across the overall network.Model interpretation.
