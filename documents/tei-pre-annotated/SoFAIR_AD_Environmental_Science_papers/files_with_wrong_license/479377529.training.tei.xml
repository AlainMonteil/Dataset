Not only can land-based measures help close the mitigation gap, if actions are well designed and implemented, mitigation can be delivered in a way that is also cost-effective, enhances resilience and adaptation to climate change, food security, biodiversity and other ecosystem services, and contributes to international sustainable development goals (Frischmann et al., 2020;Roe et al., 2019;Smith et al., 2019a). Poorly planned and implemented AFOLU mitigation activities, however, entail potential risks and tradeoffs, particularly concerning food security, biodiversity, and water quality and quantity (Humpenöder et al., 2018;Smith et al., 2020).| 3 ROE Et al. et al., 2019;UNEP, 2017).

        <p>Achieving climate targets and addressing other land-related challenges synergistically at national levels remains a large challenge and global progress is lacking. GHG emissions from AFOLU have been increasing since 2000 (Jia et al., 2019). Between 2009 and 2019, policies have only delivered mitigation of about 8 GtCO 2 from AFOLU, or ~0.5% of total emissions during that period (authors' calculations available in Supplementary Information). Current commitments under the Paris Agreement are more in line with 2.6-3.1°C of warming by the end of the century than the 1.5°C and 2°C committed to in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al., 2016). Although some progress has been made, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for 2020 and the goals of the NYDF, which aimed to halve deforestation and restore 150 million hectares (Mha) by 2020, have not been met, with reversals occurring in some instances since the targets were set (NYDF Assessment Partners, 2020; Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2020). Substantially more resources and effort will therefore be needed to scale-up land-based mitigation to fulfill its potential, maximize benefits, and limit tradeoffs.Achieving climate targets and addressing other land-related challenges synergistically at national levels remains a large challenge and global progress is lacking.

        <p>The efficacy and extent of benefits or risks of land-based measures largely depend on the type of activity undertaken, deployment strategy (e.g., scale, method, complementarity with other measures and sectors), and geographic context (e.g., current biome dynamics, climate, food system, land ownership) (Smith et al., 2019a). As such, successful and sustainable adoption and appropriate prioritization of land-based mitigation measures would benefit from more regional and country-level information on drivers of emissions, mitigation potentials, co-benefits, and risks (Crumpler et al., 2019).The efficacy and extent of benefits or risks of land-based measures largely depend on the type of activity undertaken, deployment strategy (e.g., scale, method, complementarity with other measures and sectors), and geographic context (e.g., current biome dynamics, climate, food system, land ownership) (Smith et al., 2019a).

        <p>Additionally, realizing AFOLU mitigation and co-benefit potential will require policies and measures for land and food system management that are location-and context-specific, and adaptable over time (Hurlbert et al., 2019). The success of different policies and implementation of land-based measures is dependent on enabling conditions and barriers that vary greatly by country. Available funding and economic incentives, governance and institutional capacity, technological capacity, geophysical capacity, socio-cultural context, and environmental-ecological conditions all make implementation more or less likely (de Coninck et al., 2018). Accordingly, Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have requested that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) provide more focused assessments of regional mitigation potential and their feasibility. Such information could allow national and international actors to better target investment and effort to areas of promise and need.Additionally, realizing AFOLU mitigation and co-benefit potential will require policies and measures for land and food system management that are location-and context-specific, and adaptable over time (Hurlbert et al., 2019).

        <p>This study aims to address the outlined data needs by providing (1) new and/or updated, country-level technical and cost-effective (available up to $100/tCO 2 eq) mitigation potentials, using a sectoral approach for 20 land-based measures; (2) new, regional land-based mitigation potential estimates generated from the most recent database on integrated assessment models (IAMs); (3) a national feasibility assessment and index as a proxy for gauging the barriers and enabling conditions of implementing land-based mitigation measures by country; and (4) an analysis of countries by drivers of emissions, mitigation potentials, and feasibility. We compare the available mitigation potentials in the sectoral and IAM approaches, and their feasibility, globally, and across the five high-level IPCC regions: Africa and Middle East, Asia and Developing Pacific, Developed Countries, Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, and Latin America and Caribbean. Based on the mitigation potential and feasibility data, combined with information on emissions drivers, we then provide a framing of countries to highlight different contexts, challenges, opportunities, and priorities for land-based mitigation.This study aims to address the outlined data needs by providing (1) new and/or updated, country-level technical and cost-effective (available up to $100/tCO 2 eq) mitigation potentials, using a sectoral approach for 20 land-based measures; (2) new, regional land-based mitigation potential estimates generated from the most recent database on integrated assessment models (IAMs); (3) a national feasibility assessment and index as a proxy for gauging the barriers and enabling conditions of implementing land-based mitigation measures by country; and (4) an analysis of countries by drivers of emissions, mitigation potentials, and feasibility.

        <p>We develop updated global and regional estimates of land-based mitigation potentials using both sectoral and integrated assessment model (IAM) approaches and compare the results of the two (Figure 1) to establish a likely range of potential. The sectoral approach (also referred to as a "bottom-up" approach) is based on an extensive literature review and combines mitigation potentials from individual or sectoral studies with available country-level data, and estimates "technical" potential (possible with available technology, regardless of the cost) and "cost-effective" economic potential (possible up to $100/tCO 2 eq) in 2020-2050 for 20 land-based measures in the 250 countries in the IPCC AR6 Working Group III (WGIII) country and region list. We consider mitigation up to $100/tCO 2 eq as cost-effective as it is in the middle of the range for carbon prices in 2030 for a 1.5°C pathway, and at the low end of the range in 2050 (Rogelj et al., 2018)-the timeline that we target in this assessment. Since technical potentials may not be plausible or desirable due to economic, social, political, or environmental constraints and tradeoffs, we focus the regional assessment on cost-effective potentials which represent a more realistic level regarding public willingness to pay for climate mitigation. We do not provide sectoral estimates for other carbon prices as there were fewer available data. The IAM approach (sometimes referred to as a "top-down" approach) adapts land sector data from the most recent IAM intercomparison database, ENGAGE (Riahi et al., 2021), and estimates cost-effective potential (possible up to $100/tCO 2 eq) in 2050 across six models and 131 scenarios for seven land-based measures in five regions.

        <p>IAMs assess the mitigation potential of multiple and interlinked practices across sectors and regions and can therefore account for interactions and tradeoffs (including land competition, use of other resources, and international trade) between them. IAMs can also optimize across mitigation measures based on market effects and costs. A few sectoral models also consider some level of inter-and cross-sector interactions and land allocation; however, when aggregating potentials across sectoral estimates with different methods, it is difficult to completely account for land competition and avoid double counting. Since land-based mitigation is relatively new in IAMs (Popp et al., 2017), only a limited portfolio of land-based mitigation measures is included (Figure 1). IAM data also generally have coarser resolution compared to sectoral estimates, and as such, sectoral estimates may provide more robust mitigation estimates, including country-level estimates for individual measures. To provide a comprehensive understanding of land-based mitigation potentials and their likely ranges and boundaries, it is therefore helpful to assess and compare both types of approaches and estimates (Figure 1). We use the sectoral estimates as the primary method in the regional mitigation assessment and feasibility (Section 3.2) given the country-level disaggregation and availability of more mitigation measures. The two approaches are described in more detail in Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2.IAMs assess the mitigation potential of multiple and interlinked practices across sectors and regions and can therefore account for interactions and tradeoffs (including land competition, use of other resources, and international trade) between them.

        <p>To assess national and regional mitigation potentials across a wide suite of land-based measures, we compiled and developed both F I G U R E 1 Method and comparison of mitigation potentials using two approaches: Sectoral and IAM. The sectoral approach aggregates 10 studies and 25 datasets, each with a technical and cost-effective (possible up to $100/tCO 2 eq) potential estimate for 1 of 20 land-based mitigation measures in &gt;200 countries. The mitigation potentials are averaged over the next 30 years . Data with * represent those that were adapted from their original source, and thus represent new country-level data. Mean and min-max range values were used for the five mitigation measures with more than one data source. BECCS and Clean cookstoves are excluded from the aggregate potential to avoid double counting. Demand-side measures with ** exclude emissions from land-use change to avoid double counting. Substitution options to calculate total potentials are indicated by symbols. The descriptions and methodologies for each measure are detailed in Table 1. The IAM approach estimates economic mitigation potential in 2050, up to $100/tCO 2 eq in our assessment to compare to the sectoral data. The intermodel median and min-max range is reported for seven land sector measures from six IAM models and 131 scenario runs in the ENGAGE (Riahi et al., 2021) database.

        <p>For BECCS, we estimated cost-effective potential for avoided fossil fuel emissions by comparing the carbon contents and bioenergy use of projected energy systems across a standardized set of baseline and carbon price scenarios at 100$/tCO 2 (Bauer et al., 2020), and technical potential using the baseline carbon contents of the electricity system. For biochar and biogas from manure management (anaerobic digesters), avoided fossil fuel emissions were estimated using the same energy system emissions intensities as for BECCS, assuming electricity is the primary product.For BECCS, we estimated cost-effective potential for avoided fossil fuel emissions by comparing the carbon contents and bioenergy use of projected energy systems across a standardized set of baseline and carbon price scenarios at 100$/tCO 2 (Bauer et al., 2020), and technical potential using the baseline carbon contents of the electricity system.

        <p>As much as possible, elements of the analysis were designed to avoid potential double-counting of mitigation opportunities. When aggregating total sectoral potentials, we excluded measures that may overlap on the same land. To avoid double counting with reduced deforestation, we excluded increased clean cookstoves as they may also reduce emissions from avoided forest loss and degradation. We included demand-side measures, shifting to healthy diets and reduced food waste in the aggregate estimate; however, we only account for the GHG reductions from diverted agricultural production, and exclude emissions reductions associated with landuse change. To avoid double counting with A/R and biochar, we also excluded BECCS. We included reduced peatland degradation and peatland restoration as the mitigation potential in our estimates do not account for vegetation impacts (deforestation and reforestation), but rather, avoided emissions from draining and rewetting. We selected reduced deforestation and A/R over the excluded activities given their scale and geographic scope; however, a different allocation could also be chosen (Figure 1).As much as possible, elements of the analysis were designed to avoid potential double-counting of mitigation opportunities.

        <p>We calculated the potential as the emission reduction and/or carbon enhancement available at a carbon price of $100/tCO 2 eq (range between $50 and 150/tCO 2 eq) compared to the "No Policy" baseline scenario ("NPi2100" baseline for AIM and POLES models) in 2050. As IAM mitigation estimates are based on a set of policy scenarios that result in a range of carbon prices over time, we included the range between $50 and $150/tCO 2 eq in 2050 to best represent mitigation at $100/tCO 2 eq (approximate median) across IAMs. Although IAM and sectoral approaches do not use the exact same carbon pricing method, they are close approximations of cost-effective potential. We chose the 2050 time horizon to be more comparable to sectoral estimates as model assumptions delay a majority of land-based mitigation to mid-century. We report the intermodel weighted median and range mitigation potential values across 131 scenarios and 6 models at a global and regional (five regions) level.

Developed new estimates, expanding analysis from Griscom et al. (2017) which estimated mitigation potential of biochar production considering crop residues only as a subset of possible feedstocks. We expanded the analysis to include primary and secondary residues of the top 15 crops globally by area harvested, plus cocoa, coconut, and potatoes as important regional crops (FAOSTAT, 2021), using residue production ratios from the literature (Bentsen et al., 2014;Fischer et al., 2007;Koopmans &amp; Koppejan, 2007;Scarlat et al., 2010;Searle &amp; Malins, 2015;Syamsiro et al., 2012). The fraction of primary residues of each crop that could be sustainably removed from fields was estimated based on Scarlat et al. (2010) and Woolf et al. (2010), and the fraction required for animal feed was then deducted from available residues at a regional level based on Herrero et al. (2013). Residue carbon content and biochar yield were based on Griscom et al. (2017). It was assumed that 80% of biochar carbon persists on a timescale of &gt;100 years (IPCC, 2019). We also include avoided N 2 O emission from pyrolysis of residues that would otherwise decay in the field, assuming nitrogen content per crop based on IPCC (2019) and the Phyllis database (Phyllis2, 2021), and a 1% emission factor (IPCC, 2019). For rice residues, we also consider avoided methane emission from decomposition of straw in paddies based on IPCC 2019, assuming an additional 37% reduction in methane beyond that achieved by rice management practices (Proville et al., 2020).

        <p>Wetland and urban areas are not considered in this analysis. Current cropland FMG was assumed to represent conventional tillage everywhere. Current grassland FMG was defined based on soil degradation level from The Global Assessment of Soil Degradation (GLASOD) map (Oldeman et al., 1991). For croplands, FI was defined as low where &gt;50% of crop residues are used as animal forage based on Wirsenius (2003) or where &gt;50% of area harvested is allocated to vegetable or fiber crops according to Monfreda et al. (2008). Remaining cropland FI was set to medium. These conditions then defined the 2018 SOC stock levels at each pixel. Future SOC stocks for the year 2038 were then calculated at each pixel using the SOC-modifying factors associated with the assumptions listed in each scenario. Then, for each pixel, ΔSOC was calculated as the difference between 2038 and 2018 stocks divided by 20 years. This unconstrained technical potential was then reduced using a climatic constraint on cropping interventions-for tillage, tropical montane, tropical wet and polar climates were masked out; for cover crops, tropical dry, warm/cool temperate dry, boreal and polar climates were masked out. Area available was further constrained by current regional adoption rates of no-till-based conservation agriculture adoption (Prestele et al., 2018) and winter crops (Siebert et al., 2010). In this constrained cropping area, we assumed 90% adoption for the cost-effective potential at $100/tCO 2 eq (based on Griscom et al. (2017)). For grasslands, the technical potential was constrained to degraded grasslands and non-degraded grasslands (defined by GLASOD) were masked out due to lack of opportunity. We assumed 60% adoption to estimate cost-effective potential (&lt;$100/tCO 2 eq) based on 2020), which estimates technical potential from the amount of net negative CO 2 emissions that can biophysically be achieved over a 30-year evaluation period, while considering all relevant flows of GHGs, including land-use change emissions, the lost carbon sequestration capacity of natural vegetation ("foregone sequestration"), bioenergy supply chain emissions including fertilizers, CO 2 capture efficiency, and CO 2 that is sequestered through carbon capture and storage (CCS). Alternative uses of biomass crops such as for pyrolysis or direct biomass burial were not considered. Furthermore, we exclude the mitigation potential from the substitution of fossil fuels that occurs from producing the bioenergy. We develop new estimates of cost-effective mitigation potential up to $100/tCO 2 eq by adding costs for biomass production, and conversion to electricity combined with CCS (Daioglou et al., 2019;Krey et al., 2019) Estimates represent individual studies or sectoral models (referred to as "bottom-up" or sectoral approaches).

        <p>The global shift needed to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C will require a range of enabling conditions to catalyze action and adequately address the synergies and tradeoffs between mitigation and sustainable development (IPCC, 2018). The enabling conditions, or feasibility, of effectively implementing mitigation measures, are highly contextual and vary according to each country's circumstances. We developed a quantitative index as a proxy for country-level feasibility to implement actions and realize mitigation potentials. Our framework is based on the IPCC's definition of feasibility, defined as the capacity of a system to attain a specific outcome (de Coninck et al., 2018), and includes six dimensions of feasibility: economic, institutional, geophysical, technological, socio-cultural, and environmental-ecological feasibility. Given the broad scope of "feasibility," we considered a range of enabling conditions across the six dimensions, including both state capacity and private sector/land-owner enabling conditions across all land-use management types. Our feasibility index represents a first attempt to quantify country-level feasibility using the IPCC's qualitative feasibility assessment framework. The resulting feasibility index is intended to illustrate where mitigation potential and feasibility are correlated, and identify gaps that can be addressed to increase likelihood of implementation. Where more detailed regional data exist, the approach can be refined. The feasibility assessment consisted of a two-part literature review followed by expert review of the datasets found, harmonization and scaling, and finally, calculation of a feasibility score for each country.The global shift needed to limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C will require a range of enabling conditions to catalyze action and adequately address the synergies and tradeoffs between mitigation and sustainable development (IPCC, 2018).

        <p>We evaluated the quality of the datasets to determine the country coverage and to highlight potential correlations among potential feasibility factors. For the final selection of indicators (Table 2), feasibility factor candidates were required to meet a minimum of two specific criteria. First, indicator data should be available from the last 5 years for a sufficient number of countries (&gt;100) to make a meaningful assessment. Second, a clear logic should exist in the direction of the relationship between the variable in question and the feasibility of implementation of a mitigation measure. For instance, increased tenure insecurity is associated with greater difficulty in implementing land-use activities in the AFOLU sector (Djenontin et al., 2018;Robinson et al., 2014). To incorporate more detailed enabling factors, we included some indicators that apply to the feasibility of implementing mitigation activities in either agriculture or forests and other ecosystems (agricultural value added, agriculture total factor productivity, and forest rents), recognizing that they may not necessarily apply to the other. Variables that exerted either an unclear or mixed effect (e.g., subsidies in the agriculture sector) were excluded. These two criteria resulted in the selection of 19 feasibility indicators (Table 2).We evaluated the quality of the datasets to determine the country coverage and to highlight potential correlations among potential feasibility factors.

For instance, increased tenure insecurity is associated with greater difficulty in implementing land-use activities in the AFOLU sector (Djenontin et al., 2018;Robinson et al., 2014). To incorporate more detailed enabling factors, we included some indicators that apply to the feasibility of implementing mitigation activities in either agriculture or forests and other ecosystems (agricultural value added, agriculture total factor productivity, and forest rents), recognizing that they may not necessarily apply to the other. Variables that exerted either an unclear or mixed effect (e.g., subsidies in the agriculture sector) were excluded. These two criteria resulted in the selection of 19 feasibility indicators (Table 2).</p>
        <p>Processing of the selected feasibility indicators and associated data was done following a two-step approach. First, all raw data were scaled from 0 to 100 using the formula: (x i -min(x))/(max(x)min(x))*100 where i indicates the value of indicator x for a given country. When the raw data were already scaled 0-1, it was then multiplied by 100. Where needed, the data were also harmonized for direction by applying 1-x, to ensure that higher feasibility was represented by a higher indicator value as well as to ensure consistency between indicators.Processing of the selected feasibility indicators and associated data was done following a two-step approach.

        <p>The final step involved the calculation of feasibility scores by averaging all indicators per category, then averaging each of the six categories. We calculated scores including and excluding autocorrelated indicators (Score 1 and 2), then we calculated scores with complete and incomplete country observations (Score 1a and 1b Socio-cultural Countries with higher social progress levels are more likely to absorb the costs and/or tradeoffs of implementation (Jewell &amp; Cherp, 2019;Riahi et al., 2017) Personal rights (scored 0-100) include political rights, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, access to justice, and property rights for women.The final step involved the calculation of feasibility scores by averaging all indicators per category, then averaging each of the six categories.

        <p>There is no current and publicly available data on total emissions per country that combines CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels, land-use change, and agriculture. Therefore, we summed the most recent available data on fossil CO 2 emissions (5-year average; 2015-2019) (Crippa et al., 2020), agriculture GHG emissions (5-year average; 2013-2017) (FAO, 2020a), and land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) emissions (5-year average; 2013-2017) (Grassi et al., 2021). For each country, we then calculate cost-effective mitigation potential as a share of total emissions. To identify the main drivers of land sector emissions in each country, we used agricultural emissions data from FAOSTAT (2020) (5-year average; 2013-2017), and tree cover loss data from Global Forest Watch (5-year average; 2013-2017).There is no current and publicly available data on total emissions per country that combines CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels, land-use change, and agriculture.

        <p>Between 2020 and 2050, the total cost-effective mitigation potential (up to $100/tCO 2 eq) of land-based measures using a sectoral approach is 13.8 ± 3.1 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 , 42% of the technical potential (Figure 2a). The cost-effective potential, which represents a more realistic and plausible level of deployment, is a little more than the average annual AFOLU emissions in 2007-2016 of 12 ± 2.9 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 (Jia et al., 2019). Using the IAM approach, cost-effective potential (up to $100/tCO 2 eq) in 2050 is 6.9 median (0.4-11.3 range) for AFOLU (agriculture +land-use change) and 8.0 median (0.8-16.5 range) for AFOLU +BECCS (total land-based mitigation) (Figure 2a).Between 2020 and 2050, the total cost-effective mitigation potential (up to $100/tCO 2 eq) of land-based measures using a sectoral approach is 13.8 ± 3.1 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 , 42% of the technical potential (Figure 2a).

        <p>The total cost-effective land-based mitigation potential from IAMs is 58% of the sectoral potential. The difference is largely due to four main reasons: (1) the IAMs currently incorporate only about a third of land-based mitigation measures included in the sectoral approach (Figure 1); thus, the inclusion of additional land-based measures (i.e., wetland protection and restoration, soil carbon sequestration, biochar, agroforestry, and food substitutes) could substantially increase modelled potential; (2) some IAM baselines already have small carbon prices which induce land-based mitigation, while in others, mitigation, particularly from reduced deforestation is part of the storyline even without an implemented carbon price. Both of these effects dampen the mitigation potential available in the $100/tCO 2 eq carbon price scenario; (3) the IAM estimates include overshoot scenarios which places a substantial portion of mitigation after 2050, especially terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options; and (4) it is difficult to completely account for land and resource allocation when aggregating sectoral potentials using different methods, and although we attempt to avoid double counting (see Methods), there is still a risk of overestimation in the aggregate estimates.The total cost-effective land-based mitigation potential from IAMs is 58% of the sectoral potential.

        <p>Total CDR potential in IAMs, combining land sequestration (A/R, regrowth) and BECCS is 1.7 median (0.2-11.8) GtCO 2 yr -1 up to $100/ tCO 2 in 2050. In the sectoral estimates, CDR potential, which makes up "restore" measures in forests and other ecosystems, and "sequester carbon" measures in agriculture (excluding BECCS to avoid double counting with A/R) is 20.3 ± 3.0 GtCO 2 yr -1 for technical and 6.6 ± 0.3 GtCO 2 yr -1 for cost-effective (Figure 2a). The sectoral estimates have large CDR potentials from agriculture-agroforestry, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration (4.8 GtCO 2 yr -1 up to $100/ tCO 2 )-which are not included in IAMs (Figure 3).

        <p>Forests and other ecosystems provide the largest share of landbased mitigation. In sectoral estimates, there is 18.3 ± 6.9 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 technical potential and 6.6 ± 2.9 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 cost-effective potential, or 56% and 48% of the total land-based potential, respectively (Figure 2). In IAMs, cost-effective potential from land-use change in forests and other ecosystems in 2050 is 3.5 median (1.4-8.0 range) GtCO 2 eq yr -1 , 44% of the total land-based potential. Within forests and other ecosystems in the sectoral estimates, measures that "protect" (reduce deforestation and conversion and degradation of wetlands) make up 20% and 28% of the total technical and cost-effective potential, respectively, measures that "manage" (improve forest management and grassland fire management) make up 6% and 7%, respectively, while measures that "restore" (A/R, peatland restoration and coastal wetland restoration (mangroves)) make up 30% and 13% (Figure 2a). "Protect" measures make up an increased share of the cost-effective land-based mitigation compared to the technical due to its lower cost while "restore" measures decrease by about half due to its higher cost of implementation. Across all land-based measures, "protect" measures also have the highest mitigation density per year between 2020 and 2050, at an average of about 320 tCO 2 eq ha -1 , followed by "restore" measures at 175 tCO 2 eq ha -1 . Protecting mangroves and peatlands have particularly high mitigation densities at about 1500 and 1230 tCO 2 eq ha -1 (Figure 3). The protection of primary ecosystems has significant potential for delivering co-benefits as these ecosystems provide vital ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity, water and air filtration, livelihoods, food) and can continue to sequester carbon (Figure 3, Supplementary Information). If lost, many natural ecosystems and their carbon stores are also irrecoverable by the 2050 timeframe related to 1.5-2°C pathways and biodiversity goals (Barlow et al., 2007;Goldstein et al., 2020). The potential cobenefits and possible tradeoffs of measures in forests and other ecosystems depend on how and where the measure is implemented. In the example of A/R, it will depend on the type of species used, scale of deployment (land area is ~1000 Mha to realize technical potential and ~300 Mha for cost-effective potential), method of deployment (natural regeneration vs mixed species planting vs monoculture planting), and location (ecosystem, climate, and water availability) (Cook-Patton et al., 2020;Holl &amp; Brancalion, 2020). Tradeoffs from A/R include risks to biodiversity and competition with producing food crops, potentially resulting in indirect land-use change (Doelman et al., 2020;Kreidenweis et al., 2016).Forests and other ecosystems provide the largest share of landbased mitigation. In sectoral estimates, there is 18.3 ± 6.9 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 technical potential and 6.6 ± 2.9 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 cost-effective potential, or 56% and 48% of the total land-based potential, respectively (Figure 2).

        <p>Agriculture provides the second largest share of land-based mitigation. The sectoral estimates are 11.3 ± 0.3 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 technical potential and 5.3 ± 0.2 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 cost-effective potential, or 34% and 38% of the total land-based potential, respectively (Figure 2a). In IAMs, cost-effective potential in agriculture (non-CO 2 ) in 2050 is 2.7 median (0-4.1 range) GtCO 2 eq yr -1 , 33% of total land-based potential. IAM estimates for "emissions reductions" in agriculture are over fourfold larger than sectoral estimates (0.6 ± 0.2 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 cost-effective) due to a few factors including higher non-CO 2 baseline emissions in the IAMs used, more conservative assumptions of mitigation technology uptake in the sectoral approach, and global economic models used in IAMs capturing additional demand responses and structural changes in agricultural production (Frank et al., 2018). Much of the agriculture potential from sectoral estimates are in "carbon sequestration," accounting for 32% and 34% of the total technical and cost-effective potential, respectively. Biochar stands out as the agriculture measure with the highest mitigation density, about 72 tCO 2 eq ha -1 between 2020 and 2050, followed by agroforestry and rice cultivation at about 45 tCO 2 eq ha -1 each. Biochar also has the potential to mitigate emissions from fossil fuel substitution (Figure 3). The remaining measures have more modest mitigation densities ranging from 8 to 24 tCO 2 eq ha -1 as many agriculture measures can be applied across more land (i.e., nutrient management and soil carbon management across a majority of croplands and pasturelands).Agriculture provides the second largest share of land-based mitigation.

Shifting to sustainable healthy diets makes up 7% and 10% of the total land-based technical and cost-effective potential, respectively, and reducing food waste 3% across both potentials. To avoid double counting with reduced deforestation, these sectoral estimates exclude land-use change impacts from reduced food waste and shifts to healthy diets, as well as clean cookstoves. When the entire value chain is considered (landuse change emissions and sequestration), the mitigation potential of demand-side measures increases significantly (+52% for diet shifts and +670% for reduced food waste in our estimates), and have among the highest potentials to mitigate emissions in AFOLU (Bajželj et al., 2014;Roe et al., 2019;Smith et al., 2013;Springmann et al., 2016;Tilman &amp; Clark, 2014). Demand-side measures are included in IAMs as scenario elements and/or as an endogenous response to food prices, which typically increase in response to carbon prices. Generally, the more sustainable the socioeconomic scenario used, the more diet shifts and food system efficiencies are deployed. Decreasing consumption of high greenhouse gas-intensive foods like animal-based proteins, particularly beef, and reducing food loss and waste, reduces land used for feed, water use, and soil degradation, thereby improving efficiency and generating substantial cost savings, increasing resources for improved food security, reducing land competition, and catalyzing and enabling supply-side measures such as reduced deforestation and reforestation (Figure 3, Supplementary Information).Demand-side measures provide 3.1 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 technical and 1.9 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 cost-effective potential, or 10% and 14% of the total land-based potential, respectively (Figure 2a).

        <p>Estimated mitigation from BECCS is modest, with technical and cost-effective potential in our sectoral estimate of 2.5 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 and 0.5 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 , respectively (Figure 3). Our estimate only includes the CDR potential, which accounts for the net mitigation, considering the full life-cycle emissions (land-use change emissions, forgone sequestration, bioenergy supply chain, etc.). This potential is constrained by the 30-year payback-period used here and assuming biomass supply from purpose grown crops only, with potentials increasing at longer evaluation periods or if agricultural or forestry residues were included (Hanssen et al., 2020). BECCS can also provide energy and/or materials which may be used to substitute fossil fuels and could increase mitigation potential by several orders of magnitude (Figure 3). In IAMs, the cost-effective potential of BECCS is 0.7 (0.01-7.7) GtCO 2 eq yr -1 in 2050 (9% of total land-based potential), just slightly higher than the sectoral estimates.

"Protect" measures in Developed Countries show high density due to the very small land area associated with high potential from peatland protection security. However, if well implemented (e.g., at lower scales and deployed in tandem with forest management, A/R and biochar strategies on marginal or degraded lands), BECCS also has the potential to deliver co-benefits (Figure 3, Supplementary Information).Estimated mitigation from BECCS is modest, with technical and cost-effective potential in our sectoral estimate of 2.5 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 and 0.5 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 , respectively (Figure 3).

"Protect" measures in Developed Countries show high density due to the very small land area associated with high potential from peatland protection security. However, if well implemented (e.g., at lower scales and deployed in tandem with forest management, A/R and biochar strategies on marginal or degraded lands), BECCS also has the potential to deliver co-benefits (Figure 3, Supplementary Information).</p>
        <p>The top 15 countries with the highest total cost-effective mitigation potential from land-based measures are (in descending order) the following: Brazil, China, Indonesia, United States, India, Russian Federation, Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Peru, and Myanmar (Figure 2a). Together, they account for 62% of the global mitigation potential. The countries with highest cost-effective mitigation potential are generally those with the highest AFOLU emissions. Countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan are an exception, with high AFOLU emissions and relatively lower cost-effective potential because their emissions are predominantly from livestock, which are costlier to mitigate. Total potential is generally highest in countries with large land areas. However, when the density of mitigation potential (total potential per hectare of land) is considered, some small island states move to the top, largely due to high mitigation potential in protecting or restoring wetlands and forests. The top 15 countries with the highest cost-effective density potential are (in descending order) as follows: Maldives, Brunei, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, Trinidad and Tobago, Malaysia, Malta, Rwanda, South Korea, Netherlands, Cambodia, Mauritius, Philippines, and El Salvador (Figure 2b).

        <p>Countries in the top tier (#1-3) are those with land-based mitigation potential greater than 100% of total country emissions, or "Surplus potential" countries. Tropical forest countries with relatively low fossil fuel emissions in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America are found in the "Surplus potential" tier, with Iceland as the exception. Countries in the middle tier (#4-6), or "High relative potential" countries, have land mitigation potentials between 30% and 100% of economy-wide F I G U R E 3 Climate mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in 2020-2050, by region. Technical and cost-effective ($100/ tCO 2 eq) mitigation potentials are provided for each measure using a sectoral approach according to Table 1 and Figure 1. The 20 measures are grouped into four systems-level mitigation categories, and seven management-level categories. For measures with more than one dataset, the bar graph represents the mean estimate, and the error bars represent the min and max potential range. Global mitigation potentials of substituting fossil fuels were estimated for BECCS, biochar, and manure management, shown in pink outline bars, illustrating the median and 90 th percentile values. IAM estimates (range and median, up to $100/tCO 2 eq) are provided for the seven measures where data are available in the ENGAGE database (Riahi et al., 2021). Potential co-benefits are indicated with icons, and the average global mitigation "density" (cumulative mitigation potential divided by total hectares in 2020-2050) is noted for measures with available data emission levels, higher than the global average of 20-30% to meet the 1.5°C pathway (Roe et al., 2019). "High relative potential" includes tropical forest countries and large agriculture countries with average fossil fuel emissions. Countries in the lower tier (#7-9) have lower than 30% of mitigation potential relative to total emissions, largely due to their high levels of fossil fuel emissions and/or low land-based potential (e.g., desert biomes), thus labelled "Limited relative potential" countries. The feasibility score categories of "low" (&lt;25th percentile), "medium" (25-75 percentile), and "high" (&gt;75th percentile) largely reflect countries' development level, with LDCs predominantly aggregated in "low", developing countries in "medium" and developed countries in "high", with some exceptions including Bhutan (an LDC) with a feasibility score above the 50th percentile and Russia (a developed country) scoring below the 50th percentile.

        <p>In this study, we provide a comprehensive and updated assessment of global, regional, and country-level land-based mitigation potential, and examine country-level feasibility. We show that our sectoral portfolio of 20 land-based mitigation activities has the potential to deliver 13.8 ± 3.1 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 within the cost-effective range (up to $100/tCO 2 eq), about 40% of the technical potential. The landbased mitigation potential across the integrated assessment models (IAMs) is 8.0 median (0.8-16.5 range) within the cost-effective range (up to $100/tCO 2 eq), about 60% of the sectoral estimate. Combining both approaches, we conclude that the likely range of cost-effective land-based mitigation is 8-13.8 GtCO 2 eq yr -1 between 2020 and 2050. Cost-effective mitigation potentials represent a more realistic and actionable target grounded in public willingness to pay for climate mitigation, and therefore, are more relevant in policy-making than technical potentials.In this study, we provide a comprehensive and updated assessment of global, regional, and country-level land-based mitigation potential, and examine country-level feasibility.

When the full value chain emissions of demand-side measures are considered, their potential increases threefold. Each of the 20 land-based measures incorporated in our study has potential co-benefits and risks, depending on how and where they are implemented (Figure 3, Supplementary Information). Protection of forests and other ecosystems, particularly of primary ecosystems, and demand-side measures present high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs.

        <p>Despite the advances made in this study, certain limitations and gaps remain. As previously outlined in the Methods, completely accounting for land competition, and avoiding double counting of mitigation, is difficult when aggregating sectoral estimates from different activities and methodologies. Separate studies may allocate the same land for divergent abatement activities. We attempt to limit double counting by excluding certain measures that could overlap (Methods 2.1.1). While we can limit overlapping activities, we are not able to adequately account for land competition and suboptimal allocation of land and feedstocks when combining all activities from our sectoral approach assessed in Table 1.Despite the advances made in this study, certain limitations and gaps remain.

        <p>To stay on a 1.5°C pathway, total emissions will need to fall by about 50% each decade, until net zero emissions are reached about midcentury (Rockström et al., 2017;Roe et al., 2019;Rogelj et al., 2018). This process will require the transformation of every economic sector (Rogelj et al., 2018). Because of their economic characteristics, their substantial co-benefits, their ability to work in tandem with the decarbonization of other sectors, and their potential for rapid implementation, land-based mitigation activities could provide a large share of the near-term (next decade), low-cost mitigation necessary to meet such ambitious decadal milestones. Although some land-based mitigation potentials could be realized comparatively quickly, current levels of financing and investments in land-based mitigation and nature-based solutions (UNEP, 2021) continues to be inadequate in unlocking mitigation at the cost-effective levels outlined in our study.To stay on a 1.5°C pathway, total emissions will need to fall by about 50% each decade, until net zero emissions are reached about midcentury (Rockström et al., 2017;Roe et al., 2019;Rogelj et al., 2018).

        <p>Mobilizing sufficient investments in the next few years will be critical for near-term mitigation gains. Longer-term opportunities which require more time to realize mitigation gains, like carbon sequestration measures (A/R, soil carbon management) and/or additional research, technology and development, such as the deployment of BECCS, will need up-front investment and long-term land-use planning including risk mitigation.Mobilizing sufficient investments in the next few years will be critical for near-term mitigation gains.

        <p>Our analysis adds new dimensions relevant to strategic planning and successful implementation of land-based measures, which can be used to plan and prioritize country-specific policies and measures that target co-benefits and help achieve other international goals and targets, such as the goals formulated under the NYDF and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and the SDGs. Land-based mitigation potential roughly correlates with countries' land area, but our analysis of mitigation densities reveals that many smaller countries have disproportionately high levels of mitigation potential for their size, suggesting fertile ground for targeted investments. Our feasibility assessment also suggests that weak governance, low economic development, limited access to technology, socio-cultural conditions, and low acceptance of policies could create barriers for implementing land-based mitigation, particularly in developing countries and LDCs.Our analysis adds new dimensions relevant to strategic planning and successful implementation of land-based measures, which can be used to plan and prioritize country-specific policies and measures that target co-benefits and help achieve other international goals and targets, such as the goals formulated under the NYDF and the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and the SDGs.

        <p>Collaborative efforts to reduce barriers and open opportunities at the country or regional level may release globally significant quantities of near-term mitigation at relatively low costs. The timing, quantity, co-benefits, and cost are key considerations for external actors who seek to help these countries mobilize their mitigation potential. Our research suggests that investments to increase feasibility and readiness may prove to be more cost-effective than investments aimed at the land-based mitigation activities themselves (i.e., by helping shift countries from left to right in Figures 456789, mobilizing mitigation that might otherwise be infeasible).Collaborative efforts to reduce barriers and open opportunities at the country or regional level may release globally significant quantities of near-term mitigation at relatively low costs.

        <p>Our results show that the opportunities among countries are quite heterogeneous, in terms of the relative scale of mitigation potential, the types of land-based measures available, their potential cobenefits and risks, and the feasibility of realizing them. Strategies that determine what, where, when, and how mitigation measures are implemented will therefore vary significantly by country.Our results show that the opportunities among countries are quite heterogeneous, in terms of the relative scale of mitigation potential, the types of land-based measures available, their potential cobenefits and risks, and the feasibility of realizing them.

        <p>Implementing mitigation measures that maximize co-benefits and limit risks will require strategies that consider mitigation costs and opportunities in other sectors, environmental and socio-economic consequences across stakeholders, consider tradeoffs and spillovers among mitigation actions and with other policy goals, and budgetary implications. To aid the development of such strategies, it is helpful to look at individual country plans and glean lessons learned from experiences in implementing land-based mitigation measures and policies. We highlight three countries below according to three mitigation potential tiers "Limited relative potential," "High relative potential," and "Surplus potential" (Figure 4, Section 3.1.3) to outline some lessons and considerations in scaling-up action.Implementing mitigation measures that maximize co-benefits and limit risks will require strategies that consider mitigation costs and opportunities in other sectors, environmental and socio-economic consequences across stakeholders, consider tradeoffs and spillovers among mitigation actions and with other policy goals, and budgetary implications.

        <p>China, a "Limited relative potential, medium feasibility" country, recently announced a long-term climate mitigation plan to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero emissions, or carbon neutrality, by 2060. To achieve its goals, China has to restructure its economy (Mallapaty, 2020), including a 90% reduction of all GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2005 levels and carbon removals using natural carbon sinks such as A/R and other CDR technologies (Tianjie, 2020).China, a "Limited relative potential, medium feasibility" country, recently announced a long-term climate mitigation plan to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero emissions, or carbon neutrality, by 2060.

China is an example of an industrialized country which, as a matter of priority, has to decarbonize its energy and industrial sectors (&gt;90% of its emissions), but can use AFOLU mitigation to tap into nearterm mitigation potentials that can deliver social and environmental co-benefits. Furthermore, any efforts to shift diets and reduce food waste could alter the long-term trajectory of agriculture emissions in China and beyond, especially considering its role as a major importer of agricultural commodities, including those that cause deforestation.has not yet included policy targets or measures for maintaining healthy diets or reducing food waste, which make up about 35% of its costeffective land-based mitigation potential and can deliver significant cobenefits.

        <p>These country examples within our country categories (Figure 4, Section 3.1.3) highlight various important considerations in implementing and scaling-up land-based mitigation. (1) AFOLU mitigation strategies are more successful when part of long-term strategies and policies that have a holistic view of emissions and decarbonization options from other sectors, of various land-use needs and challenges, and of sustainable economic development (Hurlbert et al., 2019). (2) Allowing for adaptive adjustments over time could enable needed corrections and enhance program sustainability and effectiveness (Hurlbert et al., 2019;Smith et al., 2020). (3) The integration of global commodity markets means that demand-side measures should complement local supply-side measures. Embedded emissions and carbon leakage, particularly for large agricultural importers, make it difficult for medium-or low-feasibility countries to collectively address AFOLU emissions, particularly where agricultural demand and economic opportunity act as drivers of deforestation (Pendrill et al., 2019). While demand-side measures are largely lacking in country NDCs, they are essential to achieve AFOLU potentials. (4) Developing and LDC countries will need to continue to develop, and could benefit from leap-frogging fossil-fuel intensive infrastructure and moving directly to sustainable energy infrastructure (Levin &amp; Thomas, 2016). ( 5) Global cooperation and tailored assistance could help address feasibility barriers in developing countries, particularly to increase economic and institutional capacity and to help develop country-specific plans to start implementation.These country examples within our country categories (Figure 4, Section 3.1.3) highlight various important considerations in implementing and scaling-up land-based mitigation.
