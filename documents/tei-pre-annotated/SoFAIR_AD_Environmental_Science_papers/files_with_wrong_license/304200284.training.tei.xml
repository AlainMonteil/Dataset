        <p>The pollution of sediments with microplastics is a widespread and global phenomenon (Barnes et al., 2009;Browne et al., 2011). The majority of studies have focused on beaches and coastal areas (reviewed in Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2015), however recent studies have documented the presence of microplastics on the seafloor at bathyal, abyssal and hadal depths (Bergmann et al., 2017;Fischer et al., 2015;Jamieson et al., 2019;Peng et al., 2018;Woodall et al., 2014). Despite these reports, the global extent and quantities of microplastics on the deep seafloor remains largely unknown.The pollution of sediments with microplastics is a widespread and global phenomenon (Barnes et al., 2009;Browne et al., 2011).

        <p>In the marine environment, microplastics will likely develop biofilms and aggregate quickly with organic material (Michels et al., 2018;Porter et al., 2018;Summers et al., 2018), which modifies the density of those particles and may facilitate their sinking to the seafloor. Due to the low oxygen levels, cold temperature, lack of ultraviolet radiation and often low energy regimes typically found in the deep benthic zone, the breakdown of plastics are much slower than compared to the terrestrial environment or sea surface (Andrady, 2011). A thorough assessment of the prevalence of microplastics on the seafloor is necessary not only to consider their long-term behaviour and explore whether this is an accumulation site for microplastics, as has been hypothesized (Kanhai et al., 2019;Woodall et al., 2014) but also to assess the fluxes of plastic reaching the seabed which can better inform plastic mass balance models (Hardesty et al., 2017;Kane and Clare, 2019;Koelmans et al., 2017) and consider their bioavailability to the benthic community. Numerous benthic species are reported to ingest microplastics (Bour et al., 2018;Courtene-Jones et al., 2017;Graham and Thompson, 2009;Taylor et al., 2016), but as yet the ambient concentrations they are exposed to and their impacts remain unclear.In the marine environment, microplastics will likely develop biofilms and aggregate quickly with organic material (Michels et al., 2018;Porter et al., 2018;Summers et al., 2018), which modifies the density of those particles and may facilitate their sinking to the seafloor.

        <p>Long-term datasets of macro/microplastics on the seafloor are sparse (Courtene-Jones et al., 2019;Maes et al., 2018) and in the absence of such monitoring the analysis of environmental archives, such as sediment cores offer a means to investigate temporal changes. Indeed, sediment cores have widely been used to assess the deposition and historical occurrence of various pollutants (Boonyatumanond et al., 2007;Bryan and Langston, 1992;Van Metre and Mahler, 2005) and more recently have been utilized to study microplastics in coastal areas (Claessens et al., 2011;Matsuguma et al., 2017;Willis et al., 2017) and freshwater lakes (Turner et al., 2019). However the same temporal analysis is lagging when considering the deep-marine environment.Long-term datasets of macro/microplastics on the seafloor are sparse (Courtene-Jones et al., 2019;Maes et al., 2018) and in the absence of such monitoring the analysis of environmental archives, such as sediment cores offer a means to investigate temporal changes.

        <p>Radionuclides offer a widely-used tool to estimate the age of sediments and have broad application including in the study of sediment dynamics, palaeoclimatic conditions and anthropogenic induced changes (Kirchner, 2011). One such isotope is lead-210 ( 210 Pb) which is a naturally occurring radioactive form of lead. 210 Pb falls out of the atmosphere and once in the air-sea interface it is quickly removed onto suspended particulate matter and deposited to the seafloor (MacKenzie et al., 2011). As a consequence the accumulation and burial of sediments, with co-contaminant radioactive decay, is assumed to produce a vertical distribution of 210 Pb with a systematic decrease in activity as a function of depth. Due to the short half-life of 210 Pb (t1/2 = ~22 years) (Komárek et al., 2008) this tracer is widely used to investigate recent events occurring over the last 100-150 years (Appleby, 2008;Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018), a resolution which aligns well with the mass production of modern plastics and thus provides a suitable method to study historic microplastic deposition.Radionuclides offer a widely-used tool to estimate the age of sediments and have broad application including in the study of sediment dynamics, palaeoclimatic conditions and anthropogenic induced changes (Kirchner, 2011).

        <p>The study aimed to quantify the abundance and polymer composition of microplastics through depthsectioned sediment cores collected from &gt; 2000 m water depth in the North East Atlantic Ocean. It was hypothesised that there would be a negative trend in the abundance of microplastics through the core profile, i.e. with increasing sediment chronology. The age of the sediment was inferred using radioisotope analysis with the aim of detecting the onset and historic prevalence of microplastics in this region. Finally, sediment characteristics such as water content, porosity, particle grain size and organic matter content were analysed to explore the relationships between these variables and the deposition of microplastics.The study aimed to quantify the abundance and polymer composition of microplastics through depthsectioned sediment cores collected from &gt; 2000 m water depth in the North East Atlantic Ocean.

        <p>The Rockall Trough is situated to the west of Scotland, United Kingdom. The monitoring site 'Gage Station M' is located in the Rockall Trough (57.300°N, -10.383° W) at a depth of 2200 m. During the 2017 research cruise DY78-79 on-board R.R.S. Discovery, three megacorer deployments were carried out within the locality of Gage Station M (Figure 1 and Supplementary Information). Megacorers are designed to sample without creating a bow-wave and thus ensure sediments are not disturbed (Jamieson et al., 2013).The Rockall Trough is situated to the west of Scotland, United Kingdom.

        <p>QA/QC was implemented wherever possible while on board the research cruise. Core tubes and rubber bungs were rinsed with deionised water prior to their use. The core collar, stainless steel cutter and spatula used to section the sediment cores were also washed thoroughly between use to prevent sample contamination or cross-contamination. Personnel wore nitrile gloves and where possible wore cotton coveralls, however due to weather limitations sometimes waterproof outwear was required. Samples of putative contaminants, such as the ropes used on the megacorer, tubes and bungs as well as clothing were taken to be analysed alongside the microplastics samples.QA/QC was implemented wherever possible while on board the research cruise.

        <p>An OSIL megacorer was utilized to obtain sediment cores from three sites around Gage Station M (details in supplementary information).

        <p>Once on deck the core tubes were carefully removed from the megacorer frame and sealed with precleaned rubber bungs at each end, before being transferred to wooden stands. The supernatant water from each of the sediment cores was carefully siphoned off so as not to disturb any of the underlying sediment. Each core (A -C) was sliced using a stainless steel cutter at discrete depth intervals; 0.5 cm sections were taken for the uppermost 5 cm of sediment, 1 cm intervals between the depths of 5 -10 cm, and 5 cm sections were taken thereafter until the end of the core. The extrusion of cores can lead to smearing effects at the outer edges (Chant and Cornett, 1987), thus a few millimetres from the edges of each core section were removed with a stainless steel spatula to avoid mixing artefacts caused by this process. Sediment horizons were transferred to labelled clean polyethylene zip lock bags, sealed immediately and frozen at -20°C for later analysis of microplastic concentrations.Once on deck the core tubes were carefully removed from the megacorer frame and sealed with precleaned rubber bungs at each end, before being transferred to wooden stands.

The characteristic emissions at 662 keV and 59.5 keV were measured for 137 Cs and 241 Am respectively (Appleby et al., 1986). The absolute efficiencies of the detector were determined using calibrated sources and sediment samples of known activity.

Each sample depth (0 -10 cm) was physically homogenized for one minute with a clean stainless steel spatula, before 5 g wet weight sub-samples was transferred to individual sterile zip-lock bags and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried material was transferred to individual falcon tubes to which 5 ml of 0.2% sodium hexametaphosphate (Calgon) dispersant and 20 ml of deionised water was added to prevent particle coagulation. Samples were mixed on a vortex mixer set at 2500 rpm for one minute.

Representative ground subsamples (in the range 25 -30 mg) were transferred to 2 ml glass ampoule and were weighed to four decimal places. Each of the sample depths were analysed in triplicate. To each ampoule, 1 ml of sulphurous acid (5 -6%) was added to remove the calcium carbonate portion of the sample. The samples were left to degas for 8 hours and were then stored under vacuum in a desiccator overnight, before being freeze-dried. The contents of each ampoule were transferred into separate tin capsules, ensuring no sediment remained on the internal walls of the glass vials. The samples were then combusted using an EAS Costech 4020 Elemental Combustion Analyser at 950°C in an oxygen rich atmosphere, which momentarily causes the temperature to rise to 1600°C. The Elemental Combustion Analyser was calibrated by analysing a series of Acetanilide carbon-nitrogen standards, and a spirulina standard and the medium organic content soil standard, B2178, were also run in parallel with the sediment samples to monitor recovery.

Microplastics were grouped into size classes of 0.5 mm intervals and Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed to identify the relationship between microplastics size and abundance. To investigate differences in the abundance of polymer types across sampling depths a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilised for log10 transformed polyester data.

        <p>Microplastics were documented throughout the upper 10 cm of the sediment core which was the maximum depth investigated in this study. The majority of published studies have only considered microplastic pollution within superficial sediments (Alomar et al., 2016;Stolte et al., 2015;Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2013). When comparing the quantities enumerated from the uppermost layer, the data from the Rockall Trough (0.196 MP g -1 in the top 0.5 cm) are similar to those reported in coastal sediments (Claessens et al., 2011;Clunies-Ross et al., 2016;Frias et al., 2016), but are lower than those in deep Arctic sediments (up to 6595 MP/kg (Bergmann et al., 2017)). Such variability in concentrations could indicate the heterogeneous spatial distribution of microplastics on the deep seafloor or may have arisen through analytical differences between the studies. Bergmann et al., (2017) report an exponential increase in the number of microplastics with decreasing size, and in the Arctic sediments they studies, 99% of the microplastics were &lt; 150µm in size. In this study, small microplastics may not have been adequately captured due to the 52 μm filter size used, and thus, based on the findings of Bergmann et al., (2017) the abundance reported here is likely an under-estimation. Microplastic concentrations varied between the sediment horizons and as hypothesized a significant negative trend was identified between the abundance of microplastics and increasing depth through the core profile corresponding to older sediments. A similar trend is reported in other studies from coastal to deep ocean environments (Brandon et al., 2019;Claessens et al., 2011;Martin et al., 2017;Matsuguma et al., 2017;Willis et al., 2017) corroborating these findings. In each of these studies the maximum burial depth of microplastics varied, this will depend partly on sedimentation rate, which differs widely between locations. In the North Atlantic the sedimentation rate is 4.4 -6.5 cm kyr -1 (Thomson et al., 2000), therefore based on this and the duration of plastic manufacture, it was expected that microplastics would be located within the top few centimetres of the sediment core only. This estimate was supported by the spike in the radioisotope 137 Cs, located at a depth of ~2.5 cm. 137 Cs is derived from human nuclear activity and due to the peak in nuclear weapons testing in 1960, a maximum of 137 Cs is generally observed in sediments corresponding to the year 1963 (Hong et al., 2011) and in turn provides a method to date modern sediments. The spike in 137 Cs activity indicates sediments located shallower than a depth of 2.5 cm have been deposited within the last ~50 years, a timescale corresponding to the mass production of plastics.Microplastics were documented throughout the upper 10 cm of the sediment core which was the maximum depth investigated in this study.

        <p>210 Pb activities were detected to a maximum depth of ~4.5 cm, estimating these sediments to be from the year 1898 ± 25, long pre-dating the production of plastics. Based on the radioisotope analyses carried out, it was therefore unexpected to find plastics distributed throughout the core. Some care is needed when interpreting chronologies derived from 210 Pb data, as a number of assumptions are made within the dating models (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978;Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018), however the dates generated from the two independent radionuclides ( 137 Cs and 210 Pb) agree, giving confidence to the data. Unsupported 210 Pb activities declined more or less exponentially through the uppermost 3.5 cm of sediment, whereupon the signal departed from this exponential trend. This could suggest variation in the sedimentation rate but more likely indicates the presence of localised physical/biological mixing (Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018).210 Pb activities were detected to a maximum depth of ~4.5 cm, estimating these sediments to be from the year 1898 ± 25, long pre-dating the production of plastics.

        <p>Most particles that sink to the seafloor are displaced a few times by fauna prior to their more or less permanent burial (Wheatcroft, 1992). Benthic species interact with the upper layers of sediment during feeding and movement and on a global scale sediment mixing occurs to a depth of 5.75 ± 4.67 cm (Teal et al., 2008). In the Feni drift, a region of the Rockall Trough to the south-west of Gage Station M, the surface mixed layer was recorded to a maximum depth of 14 -16 cm and to a depth of 17 cm on Rockall Bank (Thomson et al., 2000). This may be attributed to the presence of large burrowing species from the taxonomic groups Sipuncula, Echiuria and Aplacophora which live at depth inside burrows and can contribute to sediment reworking and the drawing down of organic matter (Haywood and Ryland, 1990;Hughes et al., 2005). The benthic ecology at Gage Station M has long been studied (Gage, 1986) and an abundant and diverse infaunal community is present which is numerically dominated by polychaetes (Davies et al., 2006;Gage, 1986;Gage et al., 1980). As such, bioturbation is present within this region (Howe, 1995;Masson et al., 2002) and some evidence of burrows were observed within some of the sediment cores used in this study. The ability of benthic organisms to transport microplastics through sediment profiles have been demonstrated in the laboratory (Lwanga, et al., 2017;Näkki et al., 2017), however by its very nature bioturbation causes sediment mixing which does not align with the discrepancy between the persistence of microplastics throughout the profile while the confinement of 210 Pb in the upper 4 cm. 210 Pb adsorbs to the charged sites on sediment grains and therefore if sediment reworking was responsible for distributing microplastics to a depth of 10 cm, 210 Pb activity would also be expected at this depth.Most particles that sink to the seafloor are displaced a few times by fauna prior to their more or less permanent burial (Wheatcroft, 1992).

        <p>Redistribution of microplastics could occur by means of internal waves, however this process would also cause the transport and sorting of sediments, which is not supported by the particle size analysis which remains relatively consistent throughout the profile. Generally locations dominated by fine grained sediments are areas where there is little effect of bottom currents and therefore limited sediment transportation, i.e. these regions are relatively static, which is upheld by the well-studied physical oceanography of the Rockall Trough (Holliday et al., 2015).Redistribution of microplastics could occur by means of internal waves, however this process would also cause the transport and sorting of sediments, which is not supported by the particle size analysis which remains relatively consistent throughout the profile.

        <p>A further explanation is offered through the analysis of the sediment properties. While no correlation was identified between the number of microplastics and the organic matter content of sediments as reported in previously (Alomar et al., 2016), a significant positive relationship was identified between sediment porosity and microplastics abundance, indicating that microplastics may be re-distributed within pore waters. Porosity is expected to decrease as a function of depth due to the consolidation of sediment particles (Reimers et al., 1992). While a general decrease is observed over the sediment core, sediment lying at a depth of 3 cm show a sharp reduction in their porosity and a gradual increase is observed between 8 to 10 cm. The majority of the microplastics identified were fibres, it is possible that due to their dimensions (long and thin) they behave in a different way to microplastic particles and may be transported between sediment grains carried within pore waters. Meiofauna inhabit the interstitial spaces between sediment grains and are abundant within deep-sea ecosystems (Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2010), including in the Rockall Trough (Davies et al., 2006;Paterson and Lambshead, 1995). These organisms displace sediment grains as they move and feed, and therefore based on their functional traits could further influence the vertical distribution of microplastics, however further work is required to assess this.A further explanation is offered through the analysis of the sediment properties.

Meiofauna inhabit the interstitial spaces between sediment grains and are abundant within deep-sea ecosystems (Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2010), including in the Rockall Trough (Davies et al., 2006;Paterson and Lambshead, 1995). These organisms displace sediment grains as they move and feed, and therefore based on their functional traits could further influence the vertical distribution of microplastics, however further work is required to assess this.</p>
        <p>Utilising FTIR spectroscopy, a diverse range of synthetic polymers (n = 11) were identified within the sediment cores (total sediment analysed amounted to 4710 cm 3 / 3.67 kg). Polyester was ubiquitous to all sampling depths and supports the widespread and prevalent occurrence of this polymer in environmental samples (Barrows et al., 2018;Browne et al., 2011;Courtene-Jones et al., 2019, 2017;Sanchez-Vidal et al., 2018). The majority of polymers were distributed more sporadically through the core, however PVC was confined only to the uppermost 0.5 cm, and polyamide and polypropylene were only present deeper than 3.5 cm and 4 cm respectively. Due to the low number of particles recovered of each polymer type more meaningful data are presented when considering the entire polymer 'community' at each depth interval. Polymer diversity, based on the Shannon Weiner index (H'), was highest in the uppermost half centimetre of sediment. This is not surprising, as freshly deposited material collects here, indicated by the higher POC and PON values. Interestingly, while not significant, there was an overall positive trend observed between polymer diversity with increasing depth; a pattern not identified in previous coring studies (Martin et al., 2017;Matsuguma et al., 2017).Utilising FTIR spectroscopy, a diverse range of synthetic polymers (n = 11) were identified within the sediment cores (total sediment analysed amounted to 4710 cm 3 / 3.67 kg).

        <p>The majority of the polymeric material had densities greater than seawater, such as polyester, polyamide, PVC, PAN and alkyd resin; these high density polymers are found extensively within sediments worldwide (Bergmann et al., 2017;Browne et al., 2011). Here, non-expanded PS (1.04 g cm -3 ) and ABS (1 -1.1 g cm -3 ) which are neutral or only slightly denser than seawater and also the positively buoyant polymer PP (0.8 g cm -3 ) were isolated between 0 and 7 cm depth, however no pattern was found between depth and the buoyant polymers.The majority of the polymeric material had densities greater than seawater, such as polyester, polyamide, PVC, PAN and alkyd resin; these high density polymers are found extensively within sediments worldwide (Bergmann et al., 2017;Browne et al., 2011).
