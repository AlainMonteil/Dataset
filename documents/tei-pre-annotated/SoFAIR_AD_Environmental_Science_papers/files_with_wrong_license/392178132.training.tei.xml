        <p>The Chinese economy has experienced robust growth in the last three decades with concomitant environmental degradation due to excessive carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. It is reported that the global energy production and consumption accounted for 25% (49 Gt CO 2 -eq, 2010) of the overall global carbon emissions (Blanco et al., 2014). It is in this light that energy consumption has shifted from being purely an environmental issue to one that has a political economy and sociocultural global implication (Liu et al., 2018). The Chinese government has therefore implemented many strategies including carbon taxes to reduce emissions, but success has been limited and in certain cases resulted in distortions (Salim et al., 2017a).The Chinese economy has experienced robust growth in the last three decades with concomitant environmental degradation due to excessive carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions.

        <p>The China Energy Statistical Yearbook shows energy annual growth rate of 8.1 over the period 1991-2013, with a total energy consumption of around 3123 Mtoe, which makes up 22.97% of the world's total energy consumption (Ouyang and Li, 2018;Liu et al., 2018;CESY, 2013). It is reported for the 17th consecutive year that China is the largest growth market for energy (BP Energy Statistics, 2018). CO 2 emissions from energy consumption increased by 1.6%, after little or no growth for the three years from 2014 to 2016. As the Chinese economy continues to reform and develop, the problems associated with rapid growth in energy demand and severe environmental pollution have become increasingly critical, contributing nearly one-third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Data show that China's per capita CO 2 emissions were 6.6 t/person, 49% above the world average but 59% below that of the United States, even as China accounted for over half of the world's total coal consumption (China Energy Statistics, 2016). It is not surprising that China's "13th Five-Year Plan", launched in 2016, requires all regional government divisions to reduce energy consumption and primary pollution (Liu et al., 2018). A key strategy to reduce environmental pollution has been an agenda towards the use of renewable energy. The combination of renewable energy and energy efficiency is estimated to provide over 90% of the necessary energyrelated CO 2 emission reductions (IRENA, 2018). The renewable energy agenda in China reports that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies have far-reaching effects for energy security, climate change economic performance, and human livelihoods and therefore need to become a national priority for the Chinese government (Lo, 2014). This means that strategies for mitigating environmental pollution and consequent climate change are critical to the economy, an act which motivates our study.The China Energy Statistical Yearbook shows energy annual growth rate of 8.1 over the period 1991-2013, with a total energy consumption of around 3123 Mtoe, which makes up 22.97% of the world's total energy consumption (Ouyang and Li, 2018;Liu et al., 2018;CESY, 2013).

        <p>Similarly, the high rate of environmental degradation and the subsequent climate change and the need for energy justice have become key human rights issues across the world. The International Renewable Energy Agency has noted that renewable resources and technologies are key to a sustainable future (IRENA, 2018). However, the big question is how growth in renewable energy impacts environmental quality in China. This question drives the study and is relevant because, an understanding of the energyenvironmental pollution nexus provides the desired information for climate change mitigation and the basis for evidence-informed energy policy (Li et al., 2016).Similarly, the high rate of environmental degradation and the subsequent climate change and the need for energy justice have become key human rights issues across the world.

        <p>It is worth mentioning that many studies have looked at the energy consumption and environmental degradation link, but the results have been inconsistent (Bekun et al., 2019;Adams and Nsiah, 2019;Apergis, 2019). With the debate on environmental degradation deepening, many analysts report (World Economic Forum, 2017) that the inconsistency in the result could be attributed to the omission of human capital, however, not much has been done about the role of education or human capital in the energy consumptionenvironmental degradation link. This study contributes to the literature in filling this gap. This is consistent with the view that human capital development or sustainable education becomes a critical factor in mitigating climate change (Ponce et al., 2019;Hassan et al., 2019;Bashir et al., 2019;Lan et al., 2012). The methodology employed allows the examination of both direct and indirect effects of human capital on climate change. Contrary to previous attempts in extant literature, we develop conceptual tool for policy direction based on novel estimation techniques.It is worth mentioning that many studies have looked at the energy consumption and environmental degradation link, but the results have been inconsistent (Bekun et al., 2019;Adams and Nsiah, 2019;Apergis, 2019).

        <p>Empirically, many studies have investigated the renewable energy and environmental pollution relationship, however, very few studies have examined the effect of human capital and environmental sustainability in mitigating climate change, especially in China. An examination of energy consumption and carbon emissions for ten Asian economies over the period 1980-2010 reports that while fossil fuel energy increases carbon emissions, renewable energy has the opposite effect (Salim et al., 2017a). In a study that forecasted the impact of renewable energy on environmental pollution in 2050 for China, renewable energy was found to promote economic growth while reducing the emissions of CO 2 and air pollutants such as NO x , and SO 2 (Dai et al., 2016). However, renewable energy must reach a minimum threshold before it can have a positive impact on environmental quality (Chiu and Chang, 2009). It is reported that the shift to renewable energy could lead to a reduction of between 17 and 57% for the Chinese economy by 2030 with huge financial implications (Urban et al., 2009). In a study of OECD1 countries, renewable energy supply is predicted to account for over 8% of total energy supply before any impact on mitigating CO 2 emissions could be observed. Similar results have been reported for Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh over the period 1978-2011 (Irfan and Shaw, 2017). Other studies, however, are not so optimistic about the role of renewable energy. For example, renewable energy is reported to escalate CO 2 emissions in developed and developing countries although nuclear energy has a positive effect on environmental quality (Apergis et al., 2010;Bölük and Mert, 2014). Meanwhile, renewable energy is reported to have no significant effect on CO 2 emissions (Al-Mulali et al., 2015).Empirically, many studies have investigated the renewable energy and environmental pollution relationship, however, very few studies have examined the effect of human capital and environmental sustainability in mitigating climate change, especially in China.

        <p>There has been a growing debate on the role of human capital in mitigating the incidence of environmental degradation and climate change impacts (Balaguer and Cantavella, 2018;Sapkota and Bastola, 2017;Salahodjaev, 2018). Education, a fibre of human capital, causes people to be more concerned about social welfare and therefore behave in a more environmentally-friendly manner (World Economic Forum, 2017). Hence, people with formal education were found to be more likely to exhibit more environmentally-oriented behaviours (Meyer, 2016). Human capital was used as a variable in identifying the determinants of environmental degradation and to reduce omitted variable bias (Balaguer and Cantavella, 2018). The findings show that higher education has a significant positive impact on environmental quality. In the case of 94 countries, higher social cognitive capital within a democratic state was found to radically increase the commitment to adopt environmental policies (Obydenkova and Salahodjaev, 2017). In another instance of the role of human capital on environmental awareness in 119 countries, it is reported that cognitive capability is positively related to climate change awareness, thus, increasing environmental quality (Salahodjaev, 2018). In a survey of 3900 adults to investigate the nexus between human capital and environmental degradation, it was reported that women and individuals with higher education are more likely than others to worry about global warming and more likely to act or adopt behavioural and technical changes (Muttarak and Chankrajang, 2015). People with higher education had a greater probability of taking knowledge-based environmentally-friendly actions, but not cost-saving pro-environmental actions (Chankrajang and Muttarak, 2017). In contrast, no significant relationship between human capital and environmental quality was found in 181 countries (Williamson, 2017) while the impact of human capital on pollution emission was found inconsistent across countries (Sapkota and Bastola, 2017).There has been a growing debate on the role of human capital in mitigating the incidence of environmental degradation and climate change impacts (Balaguer and Cantavella, 2018;Sapkota and Bastola, 2017;Salahodjaev, 2018).

        <p>However, not much has been done in the Chinese contexts though a few studies have examined the nexus between human capital and energy consumption (Salim et al., 2017b;Broadstock et al., 2016;Démurger and Fournier, 2011). It is reported that human capital reduces energy consumption between 0.18 and 0.45%. Strong accumulation of post-school human capital in eastern China is identified as a key driver for energy efficiency consumer behaviour (Salim et al., 2017b). Increasing education is positively related to pro-environmental behaviour especially in Northern China when dealing with energy source switching behaviour (Démurger and Fournier, 2011).However, not much has been done in the Chinese contexts though a few studies have examined the nexus between human capital and energy consumption (Salim et al., 2017b;Broadstock et al., 2016;Démurger and Fournier, 2011).

        <p>The literature on renewable energy, environmental sustainability and human capital in a carbon and degradation function is limited in the case of China. Thus, examining the role of environmental sustainability, human capital and renewable energy consumption in mitigating climate change has policy implications for China in terms of prioritization of strategies employed in reducing the environmental pollution.The literature on renewable energy, environmental sustainability and human capital in a carbon and degradation function is limited in the case of China.

        <p>This study collated an annual frequency data series spanning 1961-2016 based on existing theories and the United Nations guidelines and methodologies for Sustainable Development (DiSano, 2002). The selected data comprising of Human Capital Index [Abbreviated as HCPI (measured in index)], CO 2 emissions [CO2E (metric tons per capita]), Renewable energy consumption [RECON (% of total final energy consumption)], Fossil fuel energy consumption [FECON (% of total)], Trade [TRADE (% of GDP)] and GDP per capita [GDPPC (constant 2010 US dollar)] were extracted from the Quality of Government Insitute Standard Dataset (Teorell et al., 2018), while data for Ecological footprint [ECOFT (gha per person)] and Biocapacity [BIOCP (gha per person)] were mined from Global Footprint Network (Global Footprint Network, 2017). The databases follow World Bank and United Nations guidelines to ensure data quality. The human capital index captures the workforce, education and employment dynamics of a country to examine capacity, deployment, know-how and development. Thus, a useful indicator for assessing the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 that ensures sustained and productive employment. The ecological footprint measures natural resources exploited, consumed and waste generated from land and water productivity, hence, a useful indicator for assessing environmental degradation. Hereafter, ecological footprint is used as a proxy for environmental degradation, as it comprises built-up land, land used for grazing, carbon footprint, forest products, land used for cropping and fishing grounds. Biocapacity measures the regenerative capacity of available natural resources embedded ecosystem to meet human demand regardless of carbon footprint, waste generation and the use of extractive technologies. Because the ratio of biocapacity and ecological footprint underlies either ecological deficit (ecological footprint exceeds biocapacity) or ecological reserve (biocapacity exceeds ecological footprint), it appears a useful indicator for assessing environmental sustainability. Using disaggregate energy consumption (renewable and fossil fuels) individually rather than aggregated form is useful for investigating the decoupling effect of energy consumption from a policy perspective.This study collated an annual frequency data series spanning 1961-2016 based on existing theories and the United Nations guidelines and methodologies for Sustainable Development (DiSano, 2002).

        <p>Traditional forms of variable selection are always not comprehensive enough to warrant the importance of data series captured in model estimation techniques. Thus, most studies based on theoretical rather than statistical variable selection may have exaggerated a priori expectations. In line with Sarkodie and Adom (2018); Sarkodie and Ozturk (2020), we employed the variable importance in projection (VIP) based on a statistically inspired modification of partial least squares (SIMPLS) (De Jong, 1993) to examine the predictive power of the independent variables to the target variables. Fig. 1 presents the VIP of predictors in carbon and environmental degradation function. It can be observed that GDP per capita and renewable energy consumption are highly influential predictors (VIP N 1.00) while the remaining variables are moderately influential in predicting the target variables.Traditional forms of variable selection are always not comprehensive enough to warrant the importance of data series captured in model estimation techniques.

The dynamic simulations based on 1000 draws from a multivariate normal distribution among other stochastic processes facilitate the creation of new predicted emissions and degradation over the forecast period. For simplicity, we applied ± 1% shock to the individual regressors to trigger a counterfactual change in the target variables; 20 scenario time to observe the applied shock; and a range of 100 to ascertain the length of the simulation scenario of the estimated ARDL in equilibrium.The output enables the examination and visualization of how a counterfactual shock in one predictor while holding other predictors constant at a point in time has policy implications in a carbon and environmental degradation function.

        <p>Based on over two decades of historical data, the equilibrium relationship in a carbon and degradation function presented in Table 1 has policy implications. The estimated model based on Prais-Winsten AR (1) regression with robust standard errors in a degradation function (lnECOFT) has a goodness of fit (R-squared) approximately 93% compared to 79% in a carbon function (lnCO2E). All the estimated models are statistically significant (p-value b 0.01), free from conditional heteroskedasticity (archlm) and first-order serial correlation (bgodfrey), thus, validating the independence of the residuals. The coefficient of human capital (lnHCPI) is positive in both models, but statistically significant (p-value b 0.05) in the emissions model. This infers that China's intensive human capital exacerbates emissions (by ~1.17%) rather than environmental degradation. Biocapacity, a variable used as a proxy for environmental sustainability seems to have no significant impact on environmental degradation but rather emissions. Evidence from model 2 in Table 1 shows that a regeneration of the ecosystem absorbs carbon, hence, decreases emissions by ~0.37%. The coefficient of trade (lnTRADE) in both models produces varying outcomes. While trade in model 1 is negative and insignificant, it turns positive and statistically significant (p-value b 0.01) in model 2. An increase in trade appears to have a significant impact on China's emission levels, increasing it by 0.15%. To examine the economic impact on degradation and emissions, income level in both level and quadratic form was added to the After testing the long-run equilibrium and partial effects of income level in a carbon and degradation function, we estimated the response of emissions and environmental degradation to a counterfactual change in individual predictors while holding other regressors constant. Using the dynamic ARDL simulations estimation technique selected after testing the importance of variables (Fig. 1), structural breaks (Fig. 2), unit root (Appendix B), cointegration (Appendix B) and the equilibrium relationship with its corresponding diagnostic tests (Appendix C), the resulting plots are depicted in Figs. 3456. The plots of the dynamic ARDL simulations are response from emissions and degradation based on ±1% shock to the individual regressors in 20 scenario time and over a range of 100 to determine the length of the simulation scenario. All the simulated plots shown in Figs. 3456are within the red short-dash dot-dot outline patternrepresenting the 95% confidence interval, thus, the estimated models are statistically significant and stable to make unbiased inferences. The dynamic ARDL simulations in Figs. 3456reveal that a -1% shock to environmental sustainability, human capital and renewable energy consumption escalate emissions and degradation, however, -1% change in fossil fuel energy consumption and income level decline CO 2 emissions and environmental degradation. In contrast, a 1% change in human capital, renewable energy consumption and environmental sustainability mitigate CO 2 emissions and environmental degradation, while growth in income and fossil fuel energy consumption exacerbate emissions and degradation. Though a -1% change in trade hampers both long term emissions and degradation while 1% shock on trade spurs CO 2 emissions and environmental degradation, but the trend appears wiggly along the horizon (see Figs. 3c &amp;5c).Based on over two decades of historical data, the equilibrium relationship in a carbon and degradation function presented in Table 1 has policy implications.

        <p>Contrary to the standard technique based on quadratic term, we utilized the nonlinear (second degree polynomial of the regressor) estimation and U test algorithm to examine the shape and turning point of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The nonlinear estimation in emissions and degradation function based on Eq. ( 4) is depicted in Fig. 7 while the EKC Hypothesis using U test estimation technique is presented in Table 2. The predictive power (R-squared) of the nonlinear relationship between environmental degradation and regressors are: renewable energy consumption (97.7%), fossil fuel energy consumption (95.2%), and income level (98.4%).

        <p>To develop conceptual tools for policy direction, the study utilized the predictive power of neural network algorithm-based prediction profiler to examine the impact of regressors on the predicted values. Based on a TanH activation function with a single hidden layer and five hidden nodes, a predictive model was developed for both degradation and emissions. The predictive model was then validated based on the training dataset using the Random 5-fold cross-validation technique. The corresponding training and validation of the predictive model based on the neural network are depicted in Fig. 8. The Rsquare of the estimated model in both emissions and degradation function shows a predictive power of about 100% for the training and validation sets. Using the prediction profiler, a sensitivity analysis of the neural network of the estimated model is depicted in Fig. 9. A visual inspection of the sensitivity indicator (violet triangle) shows that human capital and fossil fuel energy consumption has a positive profile while environmental sustainability, renewable energy consumption, trade and income level have a negative profile in both degradation and emission function. The profiler indicates that the predicted median value of 0.90 gha per person (for environmental sustainability), 1.85 index (human capital), 22.90% (renewable energy consumption), 76.18% (fossil fuel energy consumption), 26.87% of GDP (trade), and 1587.10 constant 2010 USD (income level) spur environmental degradation and emissions by 1.51 gha per person and 2.83 metric tons per capita, respectively. This implies that higher human capital and fossil fuel energy consumption in China escalate environmental degradation and emissions whereas environmental sustainability, trade, income level and renewable energy consumption decline degradation and emissions, corroborating the equilibrium model.To develop conceptual tools for policy direction, the study utilized the predictive power of neural network algorithm-based prediction profiler to examine the impact of regressors on the predicted values.

        <p>The empirical results show that increasing human capital is conducive for the escalation of emissions and environmental degradation. The EKC hypothesis for human capital with a monotonic structure in a carbon and degradation function corroborates these results. This infers that China's historical human capital is embedded with emissions, which may be due to the use of cheap labour to achieve economic development and attract foreign direct investment (FDI) from countries with stringent environmental policies. In support of this view, it is reported that human capital plays a moderating role in the FDI-environment relationship such that in regions with high human capital, FDI has a positive effect on environmental quality and vice versa (Lan et al., 2012). Additionally, the use of environmental and energy resources in a society significantly depends on the level of education (Balaguer and Cantavella, 2018). A host country's absorptive capacity is highly related to its human capital, which determines how technology is diffused in dealing with environmental pollution (Fu, 2008). Thus, the extent of this effect depends on the workforce, education and employment dynamics of the country. This explains why countries that have deployed a broad share of their labour force with educational attainment in skill-intensive jobs have achieved high-income status (World Economic Forum, 2017). Aside from the historically-based model estimation, the prediction of the dynamic ARDL simulations indicates that a positive future shock to human capital has a diminishing effect on emissions and degradation. Meaning that improvement in human capital through capacity, deployment, know-how and development across economic sectors spurs environmental sustainability.The empirical results show that increasing human capital is conducive for the escalation of emissions and environmental degradation.

        <p>Trade has a significant positive effect on emission while no significant impact on environmental degradation, yet, the relationship exhibits a monotonic shape for both functions. This implies that the Chinese economy is sustained through pollution-embedded trade from the production process of goods and services rather than natural resource extraction. This is evident in the sensitivity indicator of the neural network predictor profiler for environmental degradation (Fig. 9). It is reported that pollution-embedded goods and services from China are more compared to countries with stringent environmental regulations (Yunfeng and Laike, 2010). Thus, the Chinese economy supports the trade-evolution hypothesiswhich posits that energy-intensive attributable emissions increase with increasing trade. The counterfactual change in trade projects that future trade in China will be volatile to external shocks, which will affect both emissions and environmental degradation. When such volatility occurs in trade, the magnitude of this effect depends on the technique effect of the economy.Trade has a significant positive effect on emission while no significant impact on environmental degradation, yet, the relationship exhibits a monotonic shape for both functions.

        <p>The inversed-U shape at a turning of 0.93 gha/person of the relationship between emissions and environmental sustainability confirms the EKC hypothesis in China while the U test estimation finds a U shape at a turning of 0.94 gha/person in a degradation function. The inversed-U shape means that the Chinese economy is initially characterized by energy and carbon-intensive production based on natural resource exploitation and waste generation (Yunfeng and Laike, 2010). But as economic and technology advance, pressure on natural resource depletion declines at a turning point in environmental sustainability, limiting resource depletion and promoting regeneration, recycling and reusing.The inversed-U shape at a turning of 0.93 gha/person of the relationship between emissions and environmental sustainability confirms the EKC hypothesis in China while the U test estimation finds a U shape at a turning of 0.94 gha/person in a degradation function.

        <p>Income level is positive in both emissions and degradation function, signifying both carbon-intensive and natural resource dependent economy. China's economic development initially exacerbates both degradation and emissions but subsequently declines environmental While fossil fuel energy consumption increases both degradation and emissions, renewable energy consumption safeguards environmental quality. Implying that, increasing the share of fossil fuel energy consumption in the energy mix spurs environmental degradation by 1.93% and emissions by 1.58%. In contrast, increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources in the energy portfolio declines emissions by 0.38% and degradation by 0.21%. A study that forecasted factors driving renewable energy and its impact on the environment and development in China for the period 2020-2030, found that the continuation of renewable energy policies underpins sustainable energy development in China (Wang et al., 2018). An earlier study for the period 1957-2005 in China found that fuel switching, especially to renewable energy sources, contributed to the reduction of CO 2 emissions (Wang et al., 2005). The empirical results explain the importance of accounting for the decoupling effect of energy consumption. The prediction profiler indicates that China's over-dependence on fossil fuel energy amounts to 76.2% compared to 22.9% of renewable energy penetration. It is reported that renewable power generation grew by 17%, higher than the 10year average and the largest increment on record (69 mtoe). Renewable power generation in China rose by 25 mtoea country record, and the second-largest contribution to global primary energy growth from any single fuel and country, behind natural gas in China. China remains the largest investor in renewables with US$78 billion, doubled its solar capacity to a cumulated 78 GW and added 20 GW of wind power capacity to reach just under 150 GW in total, more than all of Europe combined (Schneider and Froggatt, 2017).

The empirical results showed that environmental sustainability, renewable energy consumption, and income level have a negative profile in both degradation and emission function. Income level exacerbates both degradation and emissions but subsequently declines environmental degradation by 8.95% and has a positive profile with a predicted median value of 1.85 and 76.18%.
