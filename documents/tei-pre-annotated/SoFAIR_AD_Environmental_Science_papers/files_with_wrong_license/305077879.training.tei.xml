        <p>Although the fate of nanoplastics (&lt; 100 nm in size) in freshwater systems is increasingly well studied, much less is known about its potential threats to cyanobacterial blooms, as the ultimate phenomenon of eutrophication occurring world-wide. A handful of studies has evaluated the consequences of nanoplastics increasing the membrane permeability of microbes, but there is no direct evidence for interactions between nanoplastics and microcystin; intracellular hepato-toxins produced by some genera of cyanobacteria. Here we show that amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH 2 ) promote microcystin synthesis and release from Microcystis aeruginosa, a dominant species causing cyanobacterial blooms. We demonstrate that PS-NH 2 inhibits photosystem II efficiency, reduces organic substance synthesis, and induces oxidative stress, enhancing the synthesis of microcystin. Furthermore, PS-NH 2 promotes the extracellular release of microcystin from M. aeruginosa via transporter protein up-regulation and impaired cell membrane integrity. Our findings propose that the presence of nanoplastics in freshwater ecosystems might enhance the threat of eutrophication to aquatic ecology and human health.Although the fate of nanoplastics (&lt; 100 nm in size) in freshwater systems is increasingly well studied, much less is known about its potential threats to cyanobacterial blooms, as the ultimate phenomenon of eutrophication occurring world-wide.

        <p>Plastic debris are increasingly considered a global concern due to their negative social and ecological impacts 1,2,3,4 . The discarded plastic can be degraded into microplastics (0.1-5 mm in size), and even nanoplastics (&lt; 100 nm) by abiotic and biotic factors 5 . In addition, nanoplastics are directly derived from personal care and cosmetic products and industrial processes where nanoplastics are used or formed 6,7 . Although the fate and effect of nanoplastics in marine environments are increasingly well studied, much less is known about the ecological effects of nanoplastics in freshwater environments, which have been considered a major source of nanoplastics. In freshwater systems, the cyanobacteria, the extensive occurrence of which is regarded as eutrophication 8 , have repeatedly been detected as a main component attached to the plastic surface.Plastic debris are increasingly considered a global concern due to their negative social and ecological impacts 1,2,3,4 .

Microcystin have been associated with liver cancer and fatality, for example with the deaths of 60 patients after renal dialysis with microcystin-contaminated water in Brazil 11,12 .

        <p>We cultured M. aeruginosa in standard blue-green (BG-11) medium containing polystyrene nanoplastics with differential surface charge, to simulate changes caused by weathering of plastics and adsorbing of natural organic matter 13 . We found that the negative-charged sulfonic acid-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-SO 3 H) showed no obvious inhibitory effect even when the exposure concentration was 100 μg/mL (Supplementary Figure 1A). Due to electrostatic repulsion, positively charged nanoparticles interact more easily than negatively charged nanoparticles with negative membrane residuals. Hence, we found positive-charged amino-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH 2 ) had a greater influence on M. aeruginosa than negatively charged plastics (Supplementary Figure 1B). During the acute 48-h exposure, growth inhibition of M. aeruginosa by low (3.40 μg/mL) and high (6.80 μg/mL) concentrations of PS-NH 2 was 23.57% and 46.10%, respectively, with the normally green M. aeruginosa turning yellow (Fig. 1A andB), in parallel with a significant reduction in the chlorophyll-a content (Supplementary Figure 1C). This inhibition was significantly reduced upon long-term exposure (10 days), with M. aeruginosa regaining its green coloration (Fig. 1A), indicating that the interaction of nanoplastics and cyanobacteria was dynamic and without persistence within the experimental period. However, the synthesis of microcystin increased significantly both under acute and long-term exposure, compared to the control group (Fig. 1C). And microcystinleucine-arginine (MC-LR), the most common and harmful microcystin in freshwater environments, also increased significantly (Supplementary Figure 2A). Furthermore, both exposures of PS-NH 2 significantly stimulated the extracellular release of microcystin and MC-LR from M. aeruginosa (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Figure 2B).We cultured M. aeruginosa in standard blue-green (BG-11) medium containing polystyrene nanoplastics with differential surface charge, to simulate changes caused by weathering of plastics and adsorbing of natural organic matter 13 .

        <p>To identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects described above, the proteomics of M. aeruginosa under PS-NH 2 -induced stress were performed. The proteomics results revealed that PS-NH 2 had a substantial influence on cyanobacterial growth (Supplementary Figure 3). The proteins that were significantly downregulated in both low-and high-concentration treatments suggested that PS-NH 2 may inhibit the photosynthetic activity, weaken the photosynthetic electron transport chain, and reduce carbohydrate metabolism (Supplementary Figure 4; Supplementary Table 1). In addition, the acute exposure of low-concentration PS-NH 2 only influenced the light reaction of photosynthesis comparing with both the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis impaired by high-concentration PS-NH 2 treatment (Supplementary Figure . 5A). The main proteins (psbB, psbC, and psbD) involved in photosystem II were all down-regulated (Supplementary Table 1), indicating that the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II was significantly inhibited by PS-NH 2 . The weakening of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, alleviated gradually by detoxification enzymes for low-concentration exposure and continuing in the later period under high-concentration exposure, lead to the accumulation of surplus electrons and inducedoxidative stress (Supplementary Figure 5B; Supplementary Table 1). The reduction of carbohydrate metabolism was consistent with decreased growth after treatment with PS-NH 2 (Supplementary Figure 5C). Furthermore, the downregulation of lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic process-related proteins (Supplementary Table 1), involved in synthesizing integral components of the membrane, indicated damage to cell membrane integrity after PS-NH 2 exposure. The exposure to both concentrations of PS-NH 2 led to the up-regulation of proteins involved in the biological transport process (Supplementary Figure 5D; Supplementary Table 1), such as ABC transporters, which are transmembrane complexes that span both the plasma membrane and outer membrane of M. aeruginosa and actively export substrates, such as macrolide antibiotics, peptides, virulence factors, and cell envelope precursors 14 .To identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects described above, the proteomics of M. aeruginosa under PS-NH 2 -induced stress were performed.

        <p>To verify the above proteomics results, we performed a qRT-PCR assay on psbD, a key gene associated with photosynthesis II. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the qRT-PCR data (Fig. 1E) and the proteomics data was 0.80, which indicates the accuracy of the proteomics data. The down-regulation of psbD is known to interfere with electron transport, leading to the accumulation of surplus electrons and oxidative stress 15,16 . Upon acute exposure of PS-NH 2 , we observed a significant increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig. 1G) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Supplementary Figure 6A), a part of the cell's antioxidant defense system. The induction of oxidative stress was consistent with the proteomics data. The level of reduced glutathione (GSH) decreased significantly comparing with the untreated control, to eliminate the oxidative stress (Supplementary Figure 6B). For validation of proteomics analysis for cyanobacterial membrane transport, we used greenfluorescent PS-NH 2 to determine whether PS-NH 2 entered and accumulated in M. aeruginosa. The behavior of the fluorescently labelled PS-NH 2 was similar to that of PS-NH 2 , both in the culture medium and deionized water (Supplementary Figure 7).To verify the above proteomics results, we performed a qRT-PCR assay on psbD, a key gene associated with photosynthesis II.

        <p>The fluorescently labelled PS-NH 2 penetrated the cell membrane and accumulated inside the cells (Fig. 1G). The process of the nanoparticles entering the cell appeared to rupture the cell membrane, an effect seen both under acute and long-term exposure to PS-NH 2 (Fig. 1H). Such a membrane rupture could enhance the release of intracellular materials such as microcystin.The fluorescently labelled PS-NH 2 penetrated the cell membrane and accumulated inside the cells (Fig. 1G).

        <p>Given that the up-regulation for most of the proteins involved in the synthesis of microcystin 17 was not significant (Supplementary Table 2), we built co-expression modules from our proteomic data using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA). We identified 18 co-expression modules from the data regarding the 2413 proteins from the 18 samples (Fig. 2A andB), and effectively identified three groups of hub proteins (Fig. 2C,D, and E and Supplementary Fig. 8), which were placed in the middle of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (Fig. 2F). The top hub proteins marked with yellow in the brown module, with a negative correlation to the synthesis of intracellular microcystin, are tryptophan synthase C (involved in organic substance metabolic pathways). This indicates that the decrease in synthesis of organic substances stimulates the microcystin synthesis, which protects M. aeruginosa from oxidative damage. 18 The top hub proteins in the turquoise module (pyrG) and blue module (apcB1 and N44_03141) are positively and negatively correlated with extracellular microcystin, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). The proteins of pyrG and apcB1 are related to the regulation of phospholipid synthesis 19 and thylakoid membrane by module GO enrichment, respectively. Additionally, N44_03141 is an alkaline phosphatase-like protein that is associated with the integral components of the membrane. The up-regulation of pyrG protein may be a defense response against cell membranes damage. Down-regulation of apcB1 and N44_03141 was in accordance with the self-protection of thylakoid membrane and damage of cell membrane integrity, respectively. Hence, the increased synthesis of microcystin was a defense response to protect cells from oxidative damage and enhance the fitness of M. aeruginosa to the stresses caused by nanoplastics 18,20 , which was observed under exposure to antibiotic 21 , iron-limiting conditions 18 and herbicide 22 .

        <p>Our study provides a better understanding of the fate, distribution, and molecular basis of nanoplastics in aquatic primary producers, such as cyanobacteria. The extent to which the environment is contaminated with nanoplastics remains to be quantified, given the technical challenge of detecting such small and carbon-based particles in complex natural matrices. However, in the controlled laboratory, 0.3% (w/w) of a polymeric latex film formed nanoparticles with average diameter of 196.52 nm (± 89.48) after 200-days exposure into the freshwater environment. Based on the limited reports on microplastics abundance in Three Gorges Reservoir (1597 to 12,611 items/m 3 ) and midstream of the Los Angeles River (12,000 items/m) 23 , the concentration of nanoplastics in freshwater systems might be in the level of μg/mL, not to mention the meso-or macro-plastics. The exposure to nanoplastics in this concentration in the current study promoted microcystin synthesis and release from Microcystis aeruginosa, even without the change of coloration. Cyanobacterial blooms have negative consequences for both human health and aquatic ecology.Our study provides a better understanding of the fate, distribution, and molecular basis of nanoplastics in aquatic primary producers, such as cyanobacteria.

            <rs type="software">WGCNA</rs> 34 . The PPI information of differentially expressed proteins was retrieved from the IntAct molecular interaction database using the STRING software, and the results were visualized via 
            <rs type="software">Cytoscape</rs>
            <rs type="version">5</rs> software (version 
            <rs type="version">3.2.1</rs>). Furthermore, the degree of each protein was calculated to evaluate the importance of the protein in the PPI network.

        <p>All the experiments were run at least six independent experiments unless stated otherwise. For cell density evaluation, microcystin assay, gene expression, and antioxidant responses, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with an unpaired t test were performed using 
            <rs type="software">Graphpad Prism</rs>. The differences were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05 and, are referred to as *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01.
