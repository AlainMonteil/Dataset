        <p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide adopted policies that aimed to reduce transmission, culminating in March and April 2020 in many countries in staying at home and physical (or "social") distancing measures, often referred to as "lockdown". While these measures helped to bring down the number of new infections, gaining valuable time for the health sector to shore up its capacity and expertise for dealing with infected patients, it has become clear that the policy response had wide-ranging impacts on the health and well-being of populations across all sectors of society and affecting all health determinants.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide adopted policies that aimed to reduce transmission, culminating in March and April 2020 in many countries in staying at home and physical (or "social") distancing measures, often referred to as "lockdown".

        <p>The studies reported a high burden of mental health problems among several groups of the population who experienced quarantine or isolation: patients, the general population and health workers. Prevalent mental health issues include anxiety (17, 18, 21, 29-31, 33, 37, 44, 49, 52), depression (17,18,29,30,37,44,52), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), stress, (17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29-31, 37, 49, 52) and stigmatization. In particular among children, older people and health workers the evidence suggests a link between PTSD and quarantine or isolation (21,25,30,31,37,52). Stigma is linked both to quarantine and isolation (30) and particularly experienced by health workers (21) and children (31,48); the two groups experienced stigma due to quarantine even if they had been confirmed to be negative (31,48).The studies reported a high burden of mental health problems among several groups of the population who experienced quarantine or isolation: patients, the general population and health workers.

        <p>The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures had a negative impact on health care delivery, resulting in limitations to available health care services. These restrictions included: the postponement of non-urgent outpatient visits and of non-urgent surgical interventions, the reduction of non-essential services, and restrictions in accessing hospitals for both patients and their caregivers (1).The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures had a negative impact on health care delivery, resulting in limitations to available health care services.

        <p>The included studies find that restrictions of health care services posed enormous challenges to patients and health care providers, and telemedicine has been proposed by several authors as a potential solution to overcoming the barrier in accessing health care services, especially for outpatient care (3,(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)13).The included studies find that restrictions of health care services posed enormous challenges to patients and health care providers, and telemedicine has been proposed by several authors as a potential solution to overcoming the barrier in accessing health care services, especially for outpatient care (3,(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)13).</p>

The use of telemedicine has also been investigated in orthopaedic care (3,7).

        <p>The effect of lockdown measures on infection control was investigated in 12 systematic reviews (23, 27, 35, 36, 41-43, 46, 48, 50, 51). According to Chandana et al. (27), quarantine is one "of the most misunderstood and feared methods of controlling COVID-19, because it may affect both infected and non-infected individuals with psychological, economical, and emotional complications such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, insomnia, mood swings". They continue that the lockdown of a city "was proved to be effective when a study reported 72% drop in the number of infected people" (27). A systematic review conducted in China (35) emphasises that the lockdown of a city reduced the reproduction number (R0) from 3.77 to a controlled reproduction number (Rc) of 1.88 after lockdown. Other public health measures implemented, apart from citywide lockdowns and, encompassing contact tracing, intensification of screening, quarantine, and mask utilisation, may also be contributing to containing the spread of the virus (35). In fact, some systematic reviews suggest that combinations of different control measures are the most effective way to reduce transmission of the disease, prevent the collapse of health care services, and reduce mortality (41,43).The effect of lockdown measures on infection control was investigated in 12 systematic reviews (23, 27, 35, 36, 41-43, 46, 48, 50, 51).

        <p>Concerning travel restrictions, a systematic review on COVID-19, SARS and MERS suggested that travel restrictions leading to reduced transmissibility can be highly effective in containing the spread (42). In line with these results are those retrieved by the Cochrane Systematic Reviews developed by Burns et al. (23), which found that travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. In particular, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders, while entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective. The evidence is scant on the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine (23) and there is very low-certainty evidence on the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and death (41).Concerning travel restrictions, a systematic review on COVID-19, SARS and MERS suggested that travel restrictions leading to reduced transmissibility can be highly effective in containing the spread (42).

        <p>Despite quarantine and isolation being the most effective strategies for prevention of the secondary transmission of disease, the evidence suggests a greater vulnerability of older people for secondary transmission than other household members (46).

Importantly, 4 systematic reviews explored the impact of lockdown measures on health workers in terms of well-being and QOL (18,19,21,44). According to the evidence summarised in these studies, healthcare professionals who had been quarantined had more severe symptoms of post-traumatic stress than the general population, felt stigmatised, presented more avoidance behaviours, reported huger lost income, and were more affected at the psychological level (21).

        <p>The 4 systematic reviews (16,18,28,52) focussed on the correlation of infection control measures and substance abuse found that lockdown was associated with increased alcohol use disorders in the general population (18), and social isolation and quarantine were identified as potential contributors to the aggravation of substance abuse (16,52).The 4 systematic reviews (16,18,28,52) focussed on the correlation of infection control measures and substance abuse found that lockdown was associated with increased alcohol use disorders in the general population (18), and social isolation and quarantine were identified as potential contributors to the aggravation of substance abuse (16,52).</p>
        <p>A link between lockdown and domestic violence and abuse was identified in 4 systematic reviews (16,28,45,52), with three of them (16,28,52) also exploring substance abuse (see previous section). Social isolation was linked to domestic abuse and violence-related behaviour in the home (52). A systematic review identified that some factors increasing women's vulnerabilities to violence were exacerbated during the social distancing and lockdown period (45). Even quarantine can increase the power and control abusers hold over victims and trigger violence (16,45). To overcome this issue with regard to children, South Africa's strict lockdown offered protective pathways, including a policy to protect children at risk of abuse (28).A link between lockdown and domestic violence and abuse was identified in 4 systematic reviews (16,28,45,52), with three of them (16,28,52) also exploring substance abuse (see previous section).

        <p>Among the 51 systematic reviews included in our study, only two (20,53) focussed on lifestyle and dietary habits.

        <p>Overall, the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to contain the virus, such as quarantine, isolation, social distancing, and community containment, were noted to have important economic (21,27,28,31,43,48,49,51,52) and social consequences (27,31,43,44,52). In particular, quarantine was associated with the necessity to work, the fear of loss of income, the lost income itself and a reduction in overall productivity resulting in a decline of economic growth (21,27). Moreover, some systematic reviews (21,28,31,49) identified other fundamental issues, such as the lack or insecurity of supplies and food, and inadequate information, particularly linked to quarantine. School closures were associated with a loss in teaching/learning and education, as well as with wider social impact and economic harm on working parents, health workers, and other key workers being forced from work to care for children at home (17,50). Moreover, a systematic review (33) on the prevalence of anxiety in medical students during the pandemic identified concerns on economic impact, academic delay, curricular factors and impact on their daily life.Overall, the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to contain the virus, such as quarantine, isolation, social distancing, and community containment, were noted to have important economic (21,27,28,31,43,48,49,51,52) and social consequences (27,31,43,44,52).

        <p>Travel-related control measures related to quarantine had far-reaching economic, social, legal, ethical, and political implications (23). Some populations, such as in west Africa (47), had difficulties complying with certain measures, such as travel limitations and the closure of markets and places of worship, as the majority of people work in the informal sector, including trading, other businesses, transport and restoration, and these jobs are not subject to social protection.Travel-related control measures related to quarantine had far-reaching economic, social, legal, ethical, and political implications (23).

A number of important findings emerged.</p>
        <p>The first relates to the areas that have been studies so far. We intentionally kept a broad focus on all policy areas that are associated with the social determinants of health. Surprisingly, almost half of the studies (25 of 51) explore the impact of lockdown measures on mental health, with the common finding that these measures put a strain on the mental health of patients, the health workers and the general population. The second most commonly studied area, explored in 14 of the 51 included studies, was concerned with health care delivery. Many of these 14 systematic reviews explore the issue of telemedicine, with only indirect references to the Coronavirus pandemic. The impact of lockdown measures on containing the spread of the virus was explored in 12 studies, with the overall finding that these measures are successful and most promising when used in combination. In general, lockdown measures are enacted to contain the virus, but often discontinued for economic or political rather than purely epidemiological reasons. Other areas of the health impact of lockdown measures have received far less attention so far and warrant further research.The first relates to the areas that have been studies so far.

        <p>A second key finding of our study highlights that the complex and multifactorial nature of the health impact of lockdown measures, which can be both direct and indirect. While the closure of schools, for example, will have a direct impact on the education, mental and physical health of children, an indirect impact is that parents will have to stay at home to look after young children, preventing them from going to work. While our primary interest was on the impact of lockdown measures, it was sometimes difficult to ascertain whether the impact was due to these measures or the pandemic itself. We found that many studies were struggling with the same challenge. Causal pathways are often blurred, as mental health, for example, can be affected by both, policy measures and the pandemic itself. Policy measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus will have to mindful of direct and indirect impacts and intended and unintended consequences.A second key finding of our study highlights that the complex and multifactorial nature of the health impact of lockdown measures, which can be both direct and indirect.

        <p>A third key finding relates to the strength of evidence gathered by October 2020. Unsurprisingly, the evidence on the topic was still mainly focused on the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in spring 2020 and a renewed search of the literature is needed to capture more up-to-date evidence. We also identified methodological and terminological challenges. With regard to the methods used, some narrative reviews are defined by the authors as systematic reviews and vice versa. Furthermore, in many systematic reviews, conclusions are drawn based on a very limited number of papers with often low quality. In addition, in some systematic reviews, the impact of lockdown measures is mainly described in the introduction and the conclusions, rather than in the results section. There is also a need for more terminological clarity. Some authors misuse the terms "isolation" and "quarantine" and confuse "social isolation" with "isolation". to perform a systematic review of the literature regarding the consequences of COVID-19 infection in terms of domestic violence and substance abuse, and compare incidences found.A third key finding relates to the strength of evidence gathered by October 2020.

        <p>The studies reported a high burden of mental health problems among several groups of the population who experienced quarantine or isolation: patients, the general population and health workers. Prevalent mental health issues include anxiety (17, 18, 21, 29-31, 33, 37, 44, 49, 52), depression (17,18,29,30,37,44,52), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), stress, (17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29-31, 37, 49, 52) and stigmatization. In particular among children, older people and health workers the evidence suggests a link between PTSD and quarantine or isolation (21,25,30,31,37,52).

        <p>The effect of lockdown measures on infection control was investigated in 12 systematic reviews (23, 27, 35, 36, 41-43, 46, 48, 50, 51). According to Chandana et al. (27), quarantine is one "of the most misunderstood and feared methods of controlling COVID-19, because it may affect both infected and non-infected individuals with psychological, economical, and emotional complications such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, insomnia, mood swings". They continue that the lockdown of a city "was proved to be effective when a study reported 72% drop in the number of infected people" (27). A systematic review conducted in China (35) emphasises that the lockdown of a city reduced the reproduction number (R0) from 3.77 to a controlled reproduction number (Rc) of 1.88 after lockdown. Other public health measures implemented, apart from citywide lockdowns and, encompassing contact tracing, intensification of screening, quarantine, and mask utilisation, may also be contributing to containing the spread of the virus (35). In fact, some systematic reviews suggest that combinations of different control measures are the most effective way to reduce transmission of the disease, prevent the collapse of health care services, and reduce mortality (41,43).The effect of lockdown measures on infection control was investigated in 12 systematic reviews (23, 27, 35, 36, 41-43, 46, 48, 50, 51).

        <p>Concerning travel restrictions, a systematic review on COVID-19, SARS and MERS suggested that travel restrictions leading to reduced transmissibility can be highly effective in containing the spread (42). In line with these results are those retrieved by the Cochrane Systematic Reviews developed by Burns et al. (23), which found that travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. In particular, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders, while entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective. The evidence is scant on the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine (23) and there is very low-certainty evidence on the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and death (41).Concerning travel restrictions, a systematic review on COVID-19, SARS and MERS suggested that travel restrictions leading to reduced transmissibility can be highly effective in containing the spread (42).

Surprisingly, almost half of the studies (25 of 51) explore the impact of lockdown measures on mental health, with the common finding that these measures put a strain on the mental health of patients, the health workers and the general population. The second most commonly studied area, explored in 14 of the 51 included studies, was concerned with health care delivery. Many of these 14 systematic reviews explore the issue of telemedicine, with only indirect references to the Coronavirus pandemic. The impact of lockdown measures on containing the spread of the virus was explored in 12 studies, with the overall finding that these measures are successful and most promising when used in combination. In general, lockdown measures are enacted to contain the virus, but often discontinued for economic or political rather than purely epidemiological reasons. Other areas of the health impact of lockdown measures have received far less attention so far and warrant further research.The first relates to the areas that have been studies so far.

        <p>A second key finding of our study highlights that the complex and multifactorial nature of the health impact of lockdown measures, which can be both direct and indirect. While the closure of schools, for example, will have a direct impact on the education, mental and physical health of children, an indirect impact is that parents will have to stay at home to look after young children, preventing them from going to work. While our primary interest was on the impact of lockdown measures, it was sometimes difficult to ascertain whether the impact was due to these measures or the pandemic itself. We found that many studies were struggling with the F o r P e e r R e v i e w same challenge. Causal pathways are often blurred, as mental health, for example, can be affected by both, policy measures and the pandemic itself. Policy measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus will have to mindful of direct and indirect impacts and intended and unintended consequences.A second key finding of our study highlights that the complex and multifactorial nature of the health impact of lockdown measures, which can be both direct and indirect.

        <p>A third key finding relates to the strength of evidence gathered by October 2020. Unsurprisingly, the evidence on the topic was still mainly focused on the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in spring 2020 and a renewed search of the literature is needed to capture more up-to-date evidence. We also identified methodological and terminological challenges. With regard to the methods used, some narrative reviews are defined by the authors as systematic reviews and vice versa. Furthermore, in many systematic reviews, conclusions are drawn based on a very limited number of papers with often low quality. In addition, in some systematic reviews, the impact of lockdown measures is mainly described in the introduction and the conclusions, rather than in the results section. There is also a need for more terminological clarity. Some authors misuse the terms "isolation" and "quarantine" and confuse "social isolation" with "isolation". to perform a systematic review of the literature regarding the consequences of COVID-19 infection in terms of domestic violence and substance abuse, and compare incidences found.A third key finding relates to the strength of evidence gathered by October 2020.
