        <p>As a topical issue, this paper studies the responses of world stock market indices to the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. Using daily stock market returns in a sample of 94 countries and covers the period from 22 January 2022 to 24 March 2022, we consistently document a negative relationship between the Ukraine-Russia war and world stock market returns. Our results point to a larger impact at the onset of war, especially during the first two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The reaction of global stock markets was weaker in the weeks that followed. Furthermore, we find that these effects were most pronounced for countries bordering Ukraine and Russia, as well as for those UN member states that demanded an end to the Russian offensive in Ukraine. Overall, we provide the first empirical evidence of the effect of the Ukraine-Russia war on world stock market returns.As a topical issue, this paper studies the responses of world stock market indices to the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia.

In this paper, we focus on the latter. In tandem with the loss of life and destruction of property, this attack has introduced new uncertainty into world stock markets (in addition to those related to the COVID-19 pandemic). Although anecdotal, the New York Times1 noted that on the day of the attack, the S&amp;P 500 index recorded its first correction since October 2020, i.e. it fell by more than 10% from its recent peak2 .

        <p>Our results highlight a negative and significant effect of the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia on world stock returns. Although tensions between Ukraine and Russia have existed for a long time, the responses of stock market indices to the conflict were more pronounced starting with Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. However, the reaction of global stock markets was weaker in the weeks following the invasion. Finally, we notice that the performance of the stock market indices was weaker for the countries bordering Ukraine and Russia, as well as for the UN member countries that demanded an end to the Russian offensive in Ukraine.Our results highlight a negative and significant effect of the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia on world stock returns.

        <p>The results of our analysis are important on at least two aspects. First, they allow us to understand the financial impacts of the ongoing conflict so that investors, portfolio managers and policy makers can design effective financial strategies. Second, by considering the Ukraine-Russia war, we extend the previous studies on the relationship between wars and stock markets, which focused mainly on the Second World War (such as Frey and Kucher, 2003;Hudson and Urquhart, 2015;Goel et al. 2017;Richard et al. 2022).The results of our analysis are important on at least two aspects.

The daily world stock index data was obtained from the https://www.investing.com/, consisting of almost 3750 daily observations. We use the daily log return of each stock market index. Our sample is based on stock market returns in 94 countries around the Russia and Ukraine (reported in Tables with "Ukraine-Russia war").February 2022, many of the world's major forces had already been planning for it for some time and considered it only a matter of time.

        <p>In this section, we present the results of our analysis on the impact of the war between Ukraine and Russia on world stock market indices. We organize our study in several steps by investigating: (i) the impact of the war on global stock market returns (Table 1); (ii) how global stock market responses evolved from the invasion (Table 2) and several weeks afterwards (Table 3); (iii) whether the effects differed according to geographical proximity to Ukraine and Russia (Table 4); (iv) whether stock market responses differed between neutral and condemning countries (Table 5).In this section, we present the results of our analysis on the impact of the war between Ukraine and Russia on world stock market indices.

        <p>Table 1 presents our main results considering several specifications. Our results highlight a negative and statistically significant relationship at the 1% level between the current conflict and stock market indices. Indeed, our results show that tensions between Ukraine and Russia have a significant negative impact on the performance of world stock market indices 5 . This result highlights the sensitivity of world markets to the Ukraine-Russia war 6 . This result is consistent with previous analyses that have also found a negative relationship between conflict and stock market indices (e.g. Frey and Kucher, 2003;Hudson andUrquhart, 2015, 2022;Goel et al. 2017;Richard et al. 2022). For instance, exploring the effect of the Second World War (WWII) on the British stock market, Hudson and Urquhart (2015) find that the British stock market reacted negatively to WWII 7 .Table 1 presents our main results considering several specifications.

We find that the stock market indices of countries geographically close to the conflict have been the most impacted by the war (Table 4). Finally, we examine whether the impact of the war was stronger for those UN member countries that condemned the invasion compared to countries that remained neutral (e.g. China, India, South Africa) 8 .We still observe a negative stock market reaction for both the countries that condemned the invasion and those that remained neutral.
