        <p>Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW) deployable via croplands is a prime candidate to be evaluated for atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), a backstop for human-caused climate change 1 . ERW has potential co-benefits for improved food and soil security and reduced ocean acidification [2][3][4] . We use an integrated performance modelling approach for an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 °C5 . China, India, the United States and Brazil have large potential to help achieve average global CDR targets of 0.5 to 2 Gt CO 2 yr -1 with extraction costs of ~$80-180 t -1 CO 2 . These targets and costs are robust regardless of future energy policies. Deployment with existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land-ocean transfer of weathered products.</p>
        <p>Failure of the world to curb fossil fuel CO2 emissions 6 , and the inadequacy of planned mitigation measures 7 , has been greeted with growing public consternation 8 , consistent with the clear intergenerational injustice of human-caused climate change 9 . Even the most ambitious emission phase-outs 9,10 fail to achieve the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement targets for limiting global warming without the help of massive atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Extraction goals 1,7,9,10 later this century in most studies are on the order of at least 10 Gt CO2 yr -1 , although projections of rapid technological change 5 suggest a lower requirement of 2-2.5 Gt CO2 yr -1 . This formidable challenge has led to international calls for urgent research into a portfolio of CDR options to understand their feasibility, scope, costs and challenges 11,12 .</p>
        <p>Our focus is terrestrial enhanced rock weathering (ERW), a CDR strategy based on amending soils with crushed calcium-and magnesium-rich silicate rocks to accelerate CO2 sequestration [2][3][4][13][14][15][16][17] . Basalt, an abundant fast-weathering rock with the required mineral chemistry, is a prime target for implementing land-based ERW because of its potential cobenefits for crop production 18 and soil health [2][3][4] . ERW liberates base cations, generating alkalinity such that atmospheric CO2 is converted into dissolved inorganic carbon (principally hydrogen carbonate ions; HCO3 -) that is removed via soil drainage waters. These weathering products are transported via land surface runoff to the oceans with a storage lifetime exceeding 100,000 years 19 . Depending on soil type, atmospheric CO2-derived dissolved inorganic carbon may also be sequestered through the formation of soil carbonate minerals, which reduces the efficiency of carbon sequestration by ~50% 19 . Logistical infrastructure to apply basaltic rock dust to managed croplands already exists due to the common need to apply crushed limestone to reverse soil acidification from intensive cropping [2][3][4] . Thus, rapid deployment at large scale appears feasible within decades, with important ancillary benefits including mitigation of ocean acidification [15][16][17][18] . Carbon sequestration by ERW on croplands, a biogeochemical CDR option supporting multiple United Nations sustainable development goals and ecosystem services 4,20 , and a pragmatic land-use choice to maximise scalability and co-benefits, thus warrants detailed examination.</p>
        <p>We constructed a performance model with sub-national level of detail to assess quantitatively the CDR capacity and costs for land-based ERW implementation in major economies, constrained by available agricultural land area and energy production (including USA, India, China, Brazil, and Europe) (Extended Data Fig. 1). For rock weathering within the soil profile, we developed a 1-D vertical reactive transport model with steady-state flow, and a source term representing rock grain dissolution (Methods; SI figs. S1-S12; SI tables S1-S5). Our work builds on advances made in prior ERW research largely on tropical forested ecosystems [15][16][17]21,22 , with the practical aims of understanding the capacity of agriculture to capture carbon via soil amendment with milled basalt. For this initial nation-by-nation assessment, we examine the sensitivity of net CDR with current croplands to projected national energy production for 2050 under a business-as-usual energy (BAU) scenario based on ongoing energy transitions 5 . This is compared with a 2°C scenario, which includes a wide range of policy measures designed to respect the 2°C target with 75% probability 5 (SI tables S6-S12).</p>
        <p>Our geospatial analyses define a new technical potential CDR range for those nations with high capacity for ERW deployment on cropland (Figure 1; SI figs. S13-S15). For each nation, we generate CO2 capture curves by ranking CDR potential from the highest to the lowest grid cells with increasing ERW deployment. National median CO2 removal curves typically show CDR capacity rising with increasing cropland area, with carbon removal by silicate soil amendment reaching a plateau or declining in the case of Canada (Figure 1). These patterns reflect expansion of ERW into climatically unfavourable agricultural land, causing CDR potential to slow relative to the carbon penalty of logistical operations, and the 3% limit in national energy available for grinding (Extended Data Fig. 2). Overall trends in national CDR curves are relatively insensitive to the choice of energy scenario. China is the exception because its large increase in low carbon energy usage projected under the 2°C scenario 5 allows net CDR to rise by substantially reducing secondary CO2 emissions from logistical operations (Figure 1). This contrasts with results for India, whose total energy production falls by ~40% with a transition to low carbon energy production in the 2 o C scenario, lowering energy available for grinding basalt, and thus the potential for increased CDR by ERW. Reductions in energy production for other nations in the 2°C scenario compared with the BAU scenario similarly lower their potential for increased CDR with the transition to low carbon energy.</p>
        <p>Recognising the urgent need to assess large-scale options for meeting near-term CO2 removal goals 10 , we determine the potential contribution of nations to achieve CDR targets across the 0.5-2 Gt CO2 yr -1 range (Table 1; Extended Data Fig. 3). Overall, we find the three top ranked countries with the highest CDR potential are coincidentally the highest fossil fuel CO2 emitters (China, USA and India) 6 (Figure 1). Indonesia and Brazil, with CO2 emissions 10-20 times lower than the USA and China, have relatively high CDR potential due to extensive agricultural lands and climates suitable for high silicate rock weathering efficiency. European countries have an order-of-magnitude lower CDR potential than China, USA, and India, mainly because of lower agricultural land area. The top five European nations with the highest net CDR potential could offset 30% of the EU27's current emissions and the top three European countries with highest CDR potential are also the largest European emitters of CO2 from fossil fuels (Germany, Spain and Poland) 6 . Our ERW scenarios (Table 1) correspond to an aggregate CDR of 25-100 Gt CO2 if sustained over 5 decades. This would save up to 10% of the remaining cumulative carbon emission budget (~900 Gt CO2) that gives a likely chance of limiting global warming to less than 2°C above the pre-industrial average surface temperature 10 .</p>
        <p>In the context of our CDR targets, ERW has a similar potential to that of other CDR strategies 23 estimated for 2050, including bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), widely adopted in IPCC future scenarios (0.5-5 Gt CO2 yr -1 ), direct air carbon capture and storage (DAC) (0.5-5 Gt CO2 yr -1 ), biochar (0.5 to 2 Gt CO2 yr -1 ), soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration (0.5-5 Gt CO2 yr -1 ), and afforestation/reforestation (0.5-3.6 Gt CO2 yr -1 ). One benefit of country level analysis for CDR is the scope for comparative assessments with other technologies and opportunities for co-deployment. For example, our ERW CDR range is comparable with large-scale implementation of BECCS in USA by 2040 (0.3-0.6 Gt CO2 yr -1 ), as constrained by biomass productivity, location and capacity of CO2 storage sites 24 . ERW avoids competition for land used in food production, and related increased demands of BECCS for freshwater and polluting fertilizers 25 , with CO2 being treated as a resource for mineral weathering. Co-deployment of ERW with feedstock crops for BECCS and biochar could enhance the feasibility and carbon sequestration potential of these strategies 4,26 .</p>
        <p>Inorganic carbon sequestration by ERW appears comparable to SOC sequestration, another proposed CDR strategy (~2.5 Gt CO2 yr -1 by 2100) 27 using agricultural land, but with potentially greater long-term security of C-storage. Co-deployment of ERW and SOC sequestration at large-scale might, therefore, contribute substantially to the 5 Gt CO2 yr -1 carbon removal target suggested in decarbonization scenarios 10 for 2050. Compatibility of ERW and SOC sequestration may be realistic given that amendment of acidic organic-rich soils with silicate minerals, and resultant pH increase, had no effect on respiratory CO2 fluxes 28,29 , contrary to concerns that increased soil pH may accelerate organic matter decomposition 30 . However, efficacy of CO2 removal, sink saturation, and permanency of storage with these approaches, separately and interactively, are uncertain 11,23 . Abatement of soil N2O emissions by basalt application to conventionally managed arable and perennial crops 31 , and of N2O and CH4 emissions by application of artificial silicates to rice agriculture 32 , is possible. Such effects would further lower adverse impacts of agriculture on climate per unit yield, amplifying the climate mitigation potential of ERW.</p>
        <p>Greenhouse gas emissions reductions aimed at limiting future warming are defined under the Paris Agreement by Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 33 . As yet, most of the top 10 fossil carbon emitting nations are failing to meet their 2030 NDC pledges which, even if met, imply a median warming (2.6-3.1 °C) exceeding the Paris agreement 33 . Warming of this magnitude could allow the Earth system to cross thresholds for irreversible planetary heating and long-term multi-metre sea-level rise, with potentially disastrous consequences for coastal cities 34 . NDC pledged carbon emission reductions undergo periodic revision in response to trends in greenhouse gas emissions, uptake of low-carbon energy technology, and climate 33 and hence are not set for 2050. We therefore illustrate the potential for undertaking ERW with agricultural lands to strengthen near-term national 2030 NDCs (Figure 2).</p>
        <p>Results show that China may be able to augment its pledged 2030 NDCs by ~5-10%, with similar gains for the USA, which has opted-out of the Paris agreement. For India, the gain rises to 40% of its current pledged emissions, and Brazil may be able to offset 100% of its pledged 2030 CO2 emissions plus some fraction of those from other countries (Figure 2). Other countries outside Europe considered in our analysis (Indonesia, Canada, Mexico) may be able to augment their NDCs by up to 30% (Figure 2). In Europe, ERW could aid significant decarbonisation of France and Spain (up to approximately 40%), and to a lesser extent Poland, Italy and Germany (all ~10%) (Figure 2). ERW, therefore, has a role to play in compensating for residual carbon emissions from sectors recognized as being difficult to decarbonize, e.g., transportation by aviation, shipping, and agriculture 1,11 .</p>
        <p>Cost assessment is needed to evaluate commercial feasibility of ERW and to put a price on climate mitigation actions (Extended Data Fig. 4). Our cost estimates based on current prices fall within the range of prior ERW assessments ($75-250 tCO2 -1 ) 21-23 while resolving differences among nations (Figure 3; Table 1; SI figs. S16-S25; SI tables S13-S14). Average costs in USA ($160-180 t -1 CO2), Canada and European nations ($160-190 t -1 CO2) are almost 50% higher than those in China, India, Mexico, Indonesia, and Brazil ($55-120 t -1 CO2). The difference largely reflects labour, diesel and electricity costs.</p>
        <p>Defined as the cost of CO2 removal and storage, the price of carbon is a proposed economic enabler for bringing CDR strategies to market 11 . Carbon price is forecast by the World Bank 11 to reach $100-150 t -1 CO2 by 2050. Costs per t CO2 removed are generally within this projected carbon price range in all nations, but unit costs increase when cropland area exceeds the optimal fraction, because the efficiency of weathering and CDR falls (Figure 3; Table 1). A carbon price of $100-150 t -1 CO2 would cover most of the ERW costs for the key nations reported here. It would make ERW an economically attractive option for fastgrowing nations, such as India, China, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico given their estimated CO2 extraction costs of ~ $75-100 t -1 CO2 (Figure 3).</p>
        <p>Our estimated ERW costs of carbon removal for nations are comparable to estimates summarized for BECCS ($100 to 200 t -1 CO2), DAC ($100-300 t -1 CO2), and biochar ($30-$120 t -1 CO2), but higher than estimates for SOC sequestration ($0-10 t -1 CO2) 23 . Afforestation/reforestation and practices that increase soil carbon in natural ecosystems, including wetland restoration, have lower estimated costs (&lt;$100 t -1 CO2) 23 . These options, like ERW, require assessment of possible indirect unintended positive climate feedbacks.</p>
        <p>Per capita metrics help conceptualize the matter of costs in terms relevant to citizens. Current fossil fuel emissions per person per year 6 are 16.5 t CO2 (USA), 15.1 t CO2 (Canada), 7.5 t CO2 (China), 7.3 t CO2 (EU28), 2.6 t CO2 (Brazil), 1.8 t CO2 (Indonesia) and 1.7 t CO2 (India). ERW cannot offset all fossil fuel emissions, but using its cost as a guide, the per capita annual cost of achieving zero net emissions, a goal for decarbonisation, would be highest for Canada ($3004), the USA ($2780), China ($832) and EU28 nations ($1288). Costs fall substantially for citizens in Brazil ($300), Indonesia ($103) and India ($135) (Table 1).</p>
        <p>At this early stage of research and development, costs are uncertain and in need of demonstration projects 7,11,12 . Costs will likely decline as the market expands and technologies develop. This includes emergence of more energy-efficient, low-carbon technologies for rock grinding. Costs may also decline via co-deployment with afforestation/reforestation projects or agroforestry as part of worldwide carbon-offset trading schemes 7 . Net cost of ERW may be lower if rock dust is used as a fertilizer in organic agriculture, which currently occupies 57.8 million hectares, because it adds economic value by improving soil health, fertility and ecosystem services 35 .</p>
        <p>Our analysis of the techno-economic potential for CDR via ERW strengthens the case for evaluating all aspects of practical deployment in developed and developing economies. This includes meeting rock demand through alternative sources that avoid mining expansion, widening to more complete economic valuation, through to public perception and social acceptance.</p>
        <p>National demand for crushed silicate rock is contingent on extent of ERW deployment (Extended Data Fig. 5). Within our scenarios, the demand for basalt required for ERW rises with an increasing CDR target and scales with agricultural land area (Table 1). Safeguarding against substantial increased mining and possible adverse impacts on livelihoods 36 , requires exploiting underutilized stockpiles of crushed basalt produced as a by-product of the aggregate industry. Mining generates a continuous but usually discarded finely powered silicate byproduct utilizable for ERW without embodied CO2 emissions that reduce CDR efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 6) [21][22][23] , and which has been accumulating worldwide for decades. However, national inventories of the location, availability and extent of this resource are required to assess the potential contribution of this resource to carbon removal.</p>
        <p>Requirement for mining may be further reduced by utilizing artificial silicate by-products from industrial processes 37,38 , including calcium-rich silicates produced by iron and steel manufacturing (slags) with a long history of agricultural usage 4,39 . This material is recycled as low value aggregate (~&lt;$5 t -1 ), and often stockpiled at production sites or disposed of in landfills, whereas it could become a valuable commodity for CDR. The largest amounts of byproducts from the construction and demolition industry are cement, sand, and masonry. Following separation from other materials (e.g., metals and plastics), the cement comprises relatively 'clean' calcium-rich silicates and may be suitable for application to soils, but this suggestion requires field trials to assess suitability. Cement contributes ~6% to global CO2 emissions 6 and ERW may represent a land management option for valorising by-products to capture carbon and improve the sustainability of this worldwide industry.</p>
        <p>We forecast production of artificial calcium-rich cements for construction and byproduct slag from steel manufacturing for Brazil, China, India, and the USA, to understand their potential role in meeting silicate demand for ERW (Figure 4). Differences between national production estimates are driven by forecast population increases over the coming century, and per capita consumption trends for the material under the middle-of-the-road Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (Methods). Bulk silicate production, linked to the construction and demolition sector, is modelled to increase substantially in all four nations, with China and India having combined production by 2060 of ~13 Gt yr -1 (Figure 4). China and India dominate with above-average per capita cement consumption compared to the global average, and substantially larger populations than the USA and Brazil 38 . Thus, bulk silicate production of these two nations could meet the demand for ERW with large CDR potential (Table 1). Although chemically similar to basalt, these artificial calcium-rich silicates contain minerals that dissolve several orders of magnitude faster, react rapidly with CO 2 in soils under ambient conditions 40 , and are produced in fine particle sizes that facilitate accelerated weathering 41 .</p>
        <p>Agricultural production can benefit substantially from increased resource use efficiency, reducing consumption of raw materials and recovering mineral nutrients from silicate byproducts 32,42,43 , and overburden legacy reserves 44 . However, application of any silicate material to agricultural soils requires careful assessment of the risks including potential release of metals and persistent organic compounds (SI table S15). Undertaking ERW practices with these materials addresses a critical need to fertilise soils with silica and other nutrients lost by harvesting that gradually depletes plant-available pools 39 . Intensification of food production across 24 million hectares of productive agricultural land in South Asia and China, for example, is creating acidified, desilicated soils exhausted in plant nutrients (potassium, zinc and available phosphorus) that limit yields 45 . Yet these negative effects may be reversible with ERW treatments given fertilization of irrigated rice using either natural and/or artificial silicates (e.g., recycled steel slags) replenishing plant available silica pools, increasing yields and soil pH, and decreasing the mobility of potentially toxic trace elements (e.g., arsenic) 46 . ERW may therefore also have a role in remediation of toxic metal contaminated soils and sediments across 20 million hectares of cultivated land in southern China and elsewhere 47 .</p>
        <p>More broadly, innovative ERW practices via soil amendments with targeted silicate minerals could help rebuild rapidly deteriorating agricultural soils on which over six billion people depend directly for food 48 . Such practices may complement other approaches to soil improvement, including conservation tillage and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. The current substantial rate of agricultural top-soil depletion requires urgent remedial action, with significant economic costs apparent already in China where degradation of soils supporting wheat, maize and rice production costs an estimated $12 billion annually 48 . Targeted amendment of agricultural soils for CO2 removal may have a role in slowing rates of soil loss by up to 45%, with the accelerated weathering of added minerals replacing inorganic nutrients and resultant formation of clays and mineral organic aggregates increasing the cation exchange capacity and water storage capacity of rebuilt soils 4,20 . Addition of trace amounts of zinc and iron could also improve public health by reversing the effect of rising CO2 levels on the declining nutritional value of food crops 49 .</p>
        <p>Feasibility of mobilizing millions of smallholder communities to adopt ERW practices in China and India will depend on demonstrating soil improvements can reverse yield declines, and on government subsidies. Farming practices adopted for increasing sustainable productivity, for example, have transformed agriculture across 37 million hectares in China, increasing profits by $12.2 billion over a decade 50 . With 2.5 billion smallholders farming 60% of the world's arable land, a similar outreach programme could be used throughout Asia, with farmers earning more profits from higher yields while sequestering CO2. Involving local scientists in conducting research into its effectiveness and safety to build trust and engagement with smallholder farmers is key, alongside involvement with policymakers and stakeholders. This increases the potential to bring smallholders out of extreme poverty and, in the regions with climates suitable for non-irrigated agriculture, restore highly degraded soils not suitable currently for food production.</p>
        <p>Realizing the potential of ERW as a biogeochemical approach to sequester CO2 by altering land management practices will depend on the commitment of farmers and governments, implementation of the right policy frameworks, and wider public acceptance. Understanding the balance between positive and negative outcomes in terms of public acceptance of the inevitable trade-offs between local mining activities versus global sequestered carbon, requires empirical testing with stakeholders and the wider public. Crucially, such testing needs to understand the conditions that society might place upon the development and large-scale deployment of ERW technologies, as part of a wider responsible research and innovation programme 51 .</p>
        <p>Our analysis of the techno-economic potential of CDR by ERW is subject to several uncertainties, particularly variation in our baseline application rate and basalt mineralogy. It also identifies priority areas benefitting from more research of ERW under field conditions.</p>
        <p>Extrapolation of laboratory weathering rates to the field scale is a recognized potential source of uncertainty in calculated CDR rates by ERW [2][3][4][22][23][24] . We addressed this by Monte Carlo analysis of the fractal dimension accounting for uncertainty in the apparent reacting surface area of grains for ERW conducted at large geographical scales. Together with the chemical affinity effects accounted for in our model, we constrain some of the systematic errors embedded in prior ERW assessments [15][16][17]21,22 .</p>
        <p>Surface passivation, a component of chemical inhibition, occurs as weathering proceeds, creating leached layers and relatively stable secondary minerals, which potentially inhibit the mass transfer kinetics of elements from the dissolving surfaces of primary minerals. Current state-of-knowledge 52 precludes a detailed treatment of the role of surface passivation by formation of amorphous silica-rich surfaces for basalt grains added to agricultural soils. ERW analysis will benefit from future research to improve mechanistic insight and formulation of kinetic equations.</p>
        <p>It remains to be determined if our theoretical analyses of the techno-economic potential for this CDR approach are consistent with findings from long-term field-scale ERW trials. Such trials are urgently required to assess weathering and CO2 removal efficiency of freshly crushed rock grains with highly reactive surfaces added to agricultural soils subject to periodic wet-dry cycles during the growing seaon 3 . The potential for trapping of weathered cations on ion exchange surfaces or within secondary minerals other than carbonates delaying, or even preventing, land-ocean transfer will depend on soil type, climate, hydrological conditions, application rate and management practices. Duration of carbon sequestration rate, and possibility for CO2 sink saturation with ERW on croplands, are both poorly constrained by data, in common with other land-based CDR strategies 11,23 , and affect cumulative CDR potential in coming decades. Other areas for further research include quantification of biogeochemical transformations of carbon and nitrogen associated with organic and inorganic fertilization practices, atmospheric deposition, and the role of rhizosphere biology.</p>
        <p>Techno-economic assessment of ERW's potential to contribute large-scale CDR requires further integration of nation-by-nation quantitative analysis together with large-scale pilot demonstrators supported by fundamental process studies and public engagement. Our analysis identifies engineering challenges if ERW were to be scaled-up to help meet ambitious CDR targets as part of a wider portfolio of options 1,7,11,12 . ERW estimated costs are comparable to current estimates for the intensive carbon removal technologies, BECCS and DAC, and with potential for ancillary benefits by limiting coastal zone acidification and improving food and soil security. Nations that may have large ERW potential, including China, the United States and India, are all vulnerable to climate change and resultant sea-level rise 34 . Their high risks of economic damage 53 and social disruption provide impetus for creative co-design of agricultural and climate policies. Success requires incentives and regulatory frameworks that overcome social and political inertia. Silicate demand of nations must also be met in a way that facilitates social acceptance 51,54 and preservation of biodiversity 4,20 .</p>
        <p>Deployment of any CDR strategy is inhibited by concern that it may erode society's perception of the climate threat and the urgency of mitigation measures 54 . The ancillary benefits of ERW may aid its early use and relieve such concern. Innovative 'climate-smart' farming practices can be designed with ERW to draw down CO2 and other greenhouse gases while recycling nutrients, aiding soil water storage, and supporting crop production 4,18,20 . Such practices can help restore deteriorating top-soils that underpin food security for billions of people while maximizing societal co-benefits needed to incentivise deployment 20 . Financial, industrial and policy road-mapping that links short-term and long-term goals is needed, including a broader analysis of risks 23 and co-benefits [2][3][4]18,20 , to determine the role that ERW might play in climate risk mitigation.</p>

        <p>Our analysis is based on a 1-D vertical reactive transport model for rock weathering with steady-state flow 55,56 , and a source term representing rock grain dissolution within the soil profile (SI Methods). The model accounts for changing dissolution rates with soil depth and time as grains dissolve, and chemical inhibition of dissolution as pore fluids approach equilibrium with respect to the reacting basaltic mineral phases, and the formation of pedogenic calcium carbonate mineral in equilibrium with pore fluids. Simulations consider basalts exhibiting relatively slow-versus fast-dissolution rates due to differing mineralogy (SI tables S1-S3). Basaltic minerals undergo dissolution at different rates, with some minerals continuing to undergo dissolution and capture CO2 after the first year of application. Thus calculating representative annual CO2 removal rates requires computing average rates derived from repeated basaltic rock dust applications (Extended Data Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>Transport equation. The calculated state variable in the transport equation is the dissolved molar equivalents of elements released by stoichiometric dissolution of mineral i, in units of mole L -1 . ϕ is volumetric water content, Ci is dissolved concentration (mole L -1 ) of mineral i transferred to solution, t is time (y), q is vertical water flux (m y -1 ), z is distance along vertical flow path (m), Ri is the weathering rate of basalt mineral i (mole per litre of bulk soil per year) and 𝐶 𝑒𝑞 𝑖 is the solution concentration of weathering product at equilibrium with the mineral phase i (Equation 1).</p>
        <p>Mineral mass balance. The change in mass of basalt mineral i, Bi, is defined by the rate of stoichiometric mass transfer of mineral i elements to solution. Equation 2 is required because we are considering a finite mass of weathering rock, which over time can react to completion, as opposed to in situ weathering of the lithosphere, e.g. when considering weathering and geomorphology 56 .</p>
        <p>Removal of weathering products. The total mass balance over time for basalt mineral weathering allows calculation of the products transported from the soil profile. The total mass of weathering basalt is defined as follows where m is the total number of weathering minerals in the rock, tf is the duration of weathering (year) and L is the total depth of the soil profile (m).</p>
        <p>Total weathered Basalt = 𝜙 𝐶 𝑖 𝑡, 𝑧 d𝑧 𝐿 𝑧=0</p>
        <p>+ 𝑞 𝐶 𝑖 𝑡, 𝐿 d𝑡</p>
        <p>We define q as the net annual sum of water gained through precipitation 57 and irrigation 58 , minus crop evapotranspiration 59 , as calculated with high spatial resolution gridded datasets (Extended Data Figs. 8 and9; SI Table S14).</p>
        <p>Rate law. We modelled application of a crushed fast-or slow-weathering basalt, with specified mineral weight fractions and physical-chemical characteristics (SI Tables S1-S3). Rates of basalt grain weathering define the source term for weathering products and are calculated as a function of soil pH, soil temperature, soil hydrology and crop net primary productivity (NPP) using the linear transition state theory rate law [60][61][62] . Plant-enhanced basalt weathering is modelled empirically for annual and woody crops with power functions fitted to data (SI fig. S4; SI Table S4). These functions represent the effects of a range of rhizosphere processes that accelerate the physical breakdown and chemical dissolution of minerals, including the activities of nutrient scavenging mycorrhizal fungi that physically disrupt and chemically etch mineral surfaces, and bio-production of low molecular weight organic compounds and chelating agents 63,64 .</p>
        <p>Soil pH of each grid cell is dynamically calculated from the alkalinity mass and flux balance for an adaptive time-step, controlled by mineral dissolution rates on mineral dissolution, following initialization with a top soil (0-15 cm) pH value based on field data from global soil databases (SI Table S14); soil pH buffering capacity is accounted for with an empirical soil pH buffer function 65 . The soil pCO2 depth profile of a grid cell is generated with the standard gas diffusion equation 66 , scaled by crop NPP × 1.5 to account for combined autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration 67 . The alkalinity balance considers net acidity input during crop growth for biomass-cations removed from the field 68 , and secondary mineral precipitation of calcite 18 .</p>
        <p>We incorporate three further significant advances into the above 1-D vertical steady-state flow model. First, we provide a numerical basis for calculating weathering rates using log-normal particle size distributions of basalt grains produced by mechanical crushing and grinding for soil amendment 22,69,70 . This conceptualisation improves on the simplified case of a single mean particle diameter, previously used in ERW calculations [16][17][18]22,23 . Second, we apply the fractal dimension for surface roughness to relate reacting surface area to basalt mass across physical scales of weathering from the laboratory at which weathering kinetic parameter values are empirically determined to the field at which model results reflect CDR operations 71 . The fractal dimension effectively provides a means of consolidating measurements taken at different scales and accounts for uncertainties in grain topography and porosity 72 , and mass transfer rates from rock grains to flowing soil water. Finally, we calculate mean rates of rock dust weathering and CO2 removal following annual applications by tracking cohorts of particles applied over a 10year time horizon and their mineral composition (Extended Data Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>Using this modelling framework, we analysed a baseline application rate of 40 t ha -1 yr -1 (equivalent to a &lt;2 mm layer of rock powder distributed on croplands), which falls within the range of basalt amendments shown to improve crop production in field trials 4 . Net CDR is defined as the difference between CO2 capture by ERW as dissolved inorganic carbon and soil (pedogenic) carbonate and the sum of CO2 emissions for logistical operations. Carbon emissions per unit mass of ground rock depend on particle size (Extended Data Fig. 10), the CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated from component energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear and renewables), as well as the carbon costs of sourcing and transporting the silicate materials. Rock grinding to reduce particle size and maximise CDR is the primary energy consuming operation in ERW 22,23,73 .</p>
        <p>Assessment of basalt transport from source regions to croplands is based on road and rail network analyses to calculate distances, costs, and carbon emissions for each scenario (SI Methods Section 2.3). Our approach improves on prior analyses, which assumed a fixed radius between rock dust source and site of application 73 . We go beyond global cost estimates 23 by using national fuel (diesel), labour and infrastructure costs to undertake logistical operations, and the price of energy inputs to grind rocks. Our analysis thus represents the first technoeconomic assessment in which detailed ERW carbon and economic costs vary within and between nations and account for socio-technical uncertainties in energy production.</p>
        <p>We calculate carbon dioxide removal (CDR) by ERW of crushed basalt applied to soils via two pathways: 1) the transfer of weathered base cations (Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , Na + and K + ) from soil drainage waters to surface waters that are charge balanced by the formation of HCO3 -ions and transported to the ocean (Equation 4), and 2) formation of pedogenic carbonates (Equation 5).</p>
        <p>Pathway 1 for calcium ions:</p>
        <p>Pathway 2 for calcium carbonate formation:</p>
        <p>Monovalent and divalent base cations are released from basaltic minerals by dissolution based on stoichiometry (SI Table S2). CDR, via pathway 1, potentially sequesters two moles of CO2 from the atmosphere per mole of divalent cation. However, ocean carbonate chemistry reduces the efficiency of CO2 removal (ƞ) to an extent depending on ocean temperature, salinity and the surface ocean dissolved CO2 concentration. We calculate ƞ for average ocean temperature (17 °C), salinity (35%) and an RCP8.5 2050 dissolved pCO2 of 600 µatm, giving ƞ = 0.86, i.e., 0.86 mole of CO2 removal per mole of monovalent cation and 1.72 mol of CO2 removed per mol of divalent cation added to the oceans 20 . For Pathway 1, the efficiency of CDR = ƞ × mol monovalent cations +2ƞ × (mol divalent cations).</p>
        <p>CDR via pathway 2 can occur if dissolved inorganic carbon derived from atmospheric CO2 precipitates as pedogenic carbonate, and sequesters 1 mol of CO2 per mole of Ca 2+ instead of 1.72 mol of CO2 via pathway 2 and is therefore less efficient. Thus for any given grid cell, we compute CO2 removal by ERW as the alkalinity flux in soil drainage and pedogenic calcite precipitation. Possible CO2 degassing due to changes in surface water chemistry during transport in large river systems 74 is not considered.</p>
        <p>An overview of the environmental costs model and its linkages with the performance model is presented in Extended Data Fig. 4. We include contributions to total cost of 1) mining, 2) processing 75,76 , 3) distribution and transport and 4) spreading on agricultural land. We considered how the cost of energy and the carbon emissions varied with grinding to different particle size distributions (Extended Data Fig. 10). Grinding to finer particles requires greater energy and results in higher carbon emissions. We defined the particle size distribution by the p80 value; i.e. 80% of the particle mass with less than or equal to a specified particle size. We calculated the optimized p80 that results in maximum net CDR for each grid cell and this was conducted for different fractions of a country's crop area (0.1 to 1.0 at 0.1 increments), ordered according to weathering potential. For a given p80 value, we calculate the weathering rate for each grid cell, sort them in descending order and find the grid cells that comprise the cumulative area fraction for each increment.</p>
        <p>Optimization is conducted for each combination of the two types of basalt and the two quasi-log-normal particle size distributions for each country (SI Tables S1-S3). Countryspecific electricity production and the forecast fractional contributions to electricity production by different energy sources (coal, natural gas, oil, solar PV, concentrated solar power, hydropower, wind, marine) for 2050 are based on business-as-usual (BAU), i.e., currently implemented energy polices, and energy projections consistent with a 2°C (2°C) warming scenario (Extended Data Fig. 9) 5 . National CO2 emissions for electricity generation consistent with both scenarios were based on results reported in Ref 5 (SI Tables S6-S9). Industrialized nations (e.g., Canada) consume up to ~2% of their total energy production on rock comminution (crushing and grinding) processes 77 . We assume a future maximum upper limit of 3% energy consumption for all nations, based on the rationale that current rates for developed nations grow from around 2% today in-line with national projected energy production 5 in 2050 (Extended Data Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>Distribution costs and emissions were calculated by performing spatial analysis with 
            <rs type="software">ArcGIS</rs> software. Basalt rock sources were identified from the GLiM rock database 78 , excluding those in protected areas 79 . We then performed a global transport (rail and road) network analysis by modelling a logistic ERW supply by creating an Origin-Destination Cost Matrix using GIS 80,81 . For larger datasets, the Origin-Destination cost matrix searches and measures the least-cost paths along the network from multiple origins to multiple destinations to identify the most cost-effective or shortest route between a source and destination. Transport analyses used the lowest emission option between rail and road network to calculate distribution costs and CO2 emissions (SI Tables S10-S12). Freight-rail emissions were obtained from 2050 projections of reduced carbon emissions following improvements in energy efficiency 82 . Rail CO2 emissions were the same for both the business-as-usual (BAU) and 2°C scenarios. For road transport, we considered estimated energy consumption of currently/shortly available heavy electric trucks 1.38 (kWh/km) 83 and projected carbon emissions in the electricity sector of each country for BAU or the 2°C scenario 5 .

        <p>We developed a model that relates global per capita material production (for cement) or consumption (steel) P to per capita gross world product (GWP) 84,85 through historical global data using nonlinear least squares (Equation 6).</p>
        <p>where a and b are regression constants. The derived saturation value, a, was used in a further regression through national data normalised to 2014 production and GDP (Equation 7).</p>
        <p>where PREF is the global per capita consumption in a given reference year (2014), ΔGDP is the deviation of the per capita gross domestic product from the reference year, and m and r are regression constants. These results were used together with averaged projections of future GDP (SI Table S14) from the 'middle-of-the-road' Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2) to derive nationally resolved projections of future per capita consumption/production 85 . SSP2 potentially represents the largest material production pathway, as other SSPs forecast lower consumption or economic growth producing 30-50% less material globally. We have not considered the penetration of recycling into steel production beyond its current rate. Cement and cement kiln dust have no capacity to be recycled as cement. The total production/consumption at a given time, T(t), was calculated by multiplying the population, Pop(t), by production or consumption (P). We assume 115 kg of cement kiln dust is produced as a by-product in kilns for every tonne of clinker, and have modelled the production of demolition waste following an average 50-year service life (normally distributed with a standard deviation of 10 years) 86 . The ratio of pig iron to steel production (0.72) was obtained using linear regression of 1960-2014 data, negating the need to explicitly model pig iron displacement from scrap recycling, and assuming the scrap ratio remains unchanged. All steel and blast furnace slag was considered available for reaction with CO2. Between 2006-2014, 185 kg of blast furnace slag and 117 kg of steel slag was produced for every tonne of crude steel 87 . S14.</p>
        <p>Extended Data Fig. 2 | Cumulative energy demand for rock grinding by nation. Results are shown for the top seven nations of the world (a) to (g), and the top five European nations (h) to (l), as ranked by net CO2 removal capacity, with increasing fractional cropland area of enhanced rock weathering deployment. Curves depict simulations for the business as usual (BAU) and 2°C energy policy scenarios. Grey shaded area for each nation represents the 90% confidence interval calculated for basalts with relatively slow-versus fast-weathering rates for the BAU scenario; short green dashed lines indicate the 90% confidence limits of the corresponding 2°C scenario simulations.</p>
        <p>Extended Data Fig. 3 | Simulated net CO 2 removal with croplands via enhanced rock weathering. Net rates of CO2 sequestration on croplands (annual and perennial combined) for the four target global CO2 removal rates, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 Gt CO2 yr -1 (Table 1) for the business-as-usual (BAU) (a) to (d) and the 2°C (e) to (h) energy policy scenarios. S1-S3). All simulations used the same p80 particle size (100 µm) and were undertaken at 20 °C. Multi-year simulations capture the effect of basaltic minerals undergoing dissolution at different rates, with some minerals continuing to undergo dissolution and capture CO2 after the first year of application. It allows computing average rates of weathering and CO2 removal from repeated basaltic rock dust applications. Our extended theory underpinning our simulation framework tracks cohorts of particles applied each year and their mineral composition over time to account for cumulative effects (SI Methods).
