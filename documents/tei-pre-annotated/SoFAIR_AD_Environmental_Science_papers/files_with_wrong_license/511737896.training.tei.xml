        <p>Urban areas are experiencing strongly increasing hot extremes. However, these events have seldom been the focus of traditional detection and attribution analysis designed for regional-to-global changes. Here, we show that compound (day-night sustained) hot extremes are more dangerous than solely daytime or nighttime heat, especially to female and older urban residents. Urban compound hot extremes across Eastern China have increased by 1.76 days decade -1 in 1961-2014, with fingerprints of urban expansion and anthropogenic emissions detected by a stepwise detection and attribution method. Their attributable fractions are estimated as 0.51 (urbanization), 1.63 (greenhouse gases) and -0.54 (other anthropogenic forcings) days decade -1 . Future emissions and urbanization would make these compound events two-to-five times more frequent (2090s vs. 2010s), leading to a three-to-sixfold growth in urban population exposure. Our findings call for tailored adaptation planning against rapidly growing health threats from compound heat in cities.Urban areas are experiencing strongly increasing hot extremes.

        <p>Heat-related health consequences vary with characteristics of the exposed landscape and types of hot extremes. Mortality tends to be higher in urban areas, due to greater population exposure and urban heat island (UHI) effects 2,3 . Despite mounting evidence of detrimental health impacts from hot days or nights due to their high intensity and/or long duration, their occurrence in close sequence, i.e., a compound hot extreme, has received little attention but might bear disproportionately large health risks. The loss of nighttime cooling relief severely disturbs physiological responses of people well-acclimatized to the conventional hot day-cool night mode, thereby triggering mortality spikes as showcased in the 1995 Chicago and 2003 Europe events 4,5 . Given that cities are now home to more than 50% of the world's population and emit at least 70% of global greenhouse gases 6 , understanding how cities impact, and are impacted by dangerous hot extremes in the context of anthropogenic climate change is fundamental to actionable planning.

        <p>During the past few decades, broad swathes of the region experienced a significant transition of summertime hot extremes from solely daytime or nighttime events to day-night compound hot extremes 8 , with greater rates observed and projected in cities 9 . Rapid ageing of city dwellers could further enhance societal vulnerability to compound hot extremes 10 . These socio-economic, climatic, and demographic factors combine to underscore the imperative of evaluating risks of compound hot extremes over urban Eastern China, and other urbanizing regions.During the past few decades, broad swathes of the region experienced a significant transition of summertime hot extremes from solely daytime or nighttime events to day-night compound hot extremes 8 , with greater rates observed and projected in cities 9 .

        <p>A quantitative attribution of changes in urban compound hot extremes is the first step toward risk assessments, yet remains methodologically challenging. Urban-scale extremes are impacted by forcings from both large-scale drivers (e.g., globally well-mixed greenhouse gases) and local urbanization. The standard detection and attribution framework, based on coarse-resolution climate models, has long been dedicated to contributions from large-scale drivers only 11 . The metric of 'urban minus rural' in observations 12 that was preferentially used to approximate urbanization effects on extremes downplays other urban-rural contrasting forcings, such as aerosol loadings and widespread deforestation/aforestation 13 .A quantitative attribution of changes in urban compound hot extremes is the first step toward risk assessments, yet remains methodologically challenging.

        <p>An accurate understanding on the vulnerability of urban population to compound hot extremes is another prerequisite to the risk assessment, but is hampered by the prevalence of univariate definition of hot extremes in both epidemiology and climate sciences. For instance, a hot day defined by a threshold-exceeding daily maximum temperature is intended for daytime-only heat, which is then believed accountable for heat-related mortality of the day 17,18 . This practice might exaggerate the impact of presumed daytime exposure because of overlooking confounding effects of the preceding (midnight-to-sunrise) or/and following (evening-to-midnight) nighttime heat. The mismatch between the exposure and vulnerability stands out in hot night analysis as well 19 . The univariate definition also hinders our ability to realize substantially differing long-term trends 8 and physical mechanisms 20 amongst daytime, nighttime and compound hot extremes, possibly leading to the process-based weather forecast and the associated heat warning deviated from the right type of events. Hence, it is worthwhile to adopt a bivariate-definitional perspective to revisit the health impact from daytime and nighttime hot extremes, both independently and interactively, to pin down the most dangerous configuration.An accurate understanding on the vulnerability of urban population to compound hot extremes is another prerequisite to the risk assessment, but is hampered by the prevalence of univariate definition of hot extremes in both epidemiology and climate sciences.

        <p>To gain insights into above gaps, focusing on Eastern China, we firstly re-evaluate human health impacts of urban hot extremes based on a bivariate classification. With respect to the identified most health-detrimental type, we then conduct quantitative detection and attribution of past changes based on a novel framework, and make observationally constrained projections. The outcomes provide the most comprehensive understanding, to date, on urban compound hot extremes.To gain insights into above gaps, focusing on Eastern China, we firstly re-evaluate human health impacts of urban hot extremes based on a bivariate classification.

        <p>Mortality risk attributed to compound hot extremes. We calculate the pooled relative risks (RRs, 1-day lag cumulative effects accounted for) of summertime hot extremes on mortality in 98 death surveillance sites covering major urban agglomerations in China (Fig. 1; see Methods). For total non-accidental mortality, the cumulative risk of compound hot extremes (best-estimated RR=1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.17) is significantly higher than normal days (dashed line in Fig. 1), and also markedly larger than that of daytime-and nighttime-only events. The RRs of compound hot extremes remain significant and the highest across gender and age groups, with female (best-estimated=1.19, 1.16-1.22) and older adults (≥ 75 years old, best-estimated=1.20, 1.17-1.23) most at risk. This conclusion robustly holds against the consideration of longer lags (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the choice of mortality records of varying periods, locations and numbers of surveillance sites (Supplementary Table 1; see Methods). These analyses present clear evidence that compound hot extremes are more deadly than daytime-and nighttime-only events to city dwellers over Eastern China.Mortality risk attributed to compound hot extremes.

        <p>Faster increase in compound hot extremes in cities. Based on satellite-sensing land use/land cover maps (see Methods), urban stations are dynamically classified with time, to better characterize both the expansion of pre-existing cities and the construction of new ones. Summertime compound hot extremes are on the rise during 1961-2014 in both urban and rural areas, with larger frequency increases observed in northeast and southeast China (Supplementary Figs. 2a and2b). A relatively small increase in the North China Plain is sandwiched in-between, possibly due to the cooling caused by intense haze pollution 21 and expanding irrigation 22 . The overall pattern is well reproduced by the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean (Supplementary Fig. 3). Urban areas have shown stronger increases in event frequency at both grid-level (Supplementary Fig. 2c) and regional-scale (Supplementary Fig. 2d), especially after the mid-1980s coincident to the start of rapid urban expansion 23 .Faster increase in compound hot extremes in cities.

        <p>Drivers for the increase of urban compound hot extremes. To unify regional urbanization and large-scale external forcings in the quantitative detection and attribution, we develop a stepwise framework combining observations and simulations (see Methods). The high collinearity between greenhouse gases-and urbanization-forced patterns does not allow us to attribute all signals simultaneously 24 (see Discussion).Drivers for the increase of urban compound hot extremes.

        <p>As urbanization forcing is absent in both simulations and rural observations, as the first step, we attribute observed changes in rural-mean frequency using space-time fingerprinting (see Methods). The observed increasing trend for rural events falls within the realm of the ensemble simulations containing all known large-scale forcings (ALL; Fig. 2a), but cannot be reproduced by the simulations driven purely by natural forcings (NAT), suggesting a key role of anthropogenic forcings (ANT) in it. The two-signal analysis does detect ANT in the rural-mean series (the scaling factor excludes zero; see Methods), while the signal of NAT is non-detectable (Fig. 3a). We further disentangle the contributions from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), other anthropogenic forcings (OANT; dominated by anthropogenic aerosols and large-scale land use changes) and natural forcings (Fig. 3a). In this three-signal detection, both the forcings of GHG and OANT can be detected, and the NAT forcing remains non-detectable. The below-unity scaling factors for ANT and GHG indicate an overestimate for the amplitude of responses to GHG-dominated anthropogenic forcings in models. Forced by anthropogenic GHG alone, the increase in rural compound hot extremes, estimated at 1.63 days decade -1 (5-95% uncertainty range [UR]: 1.16-2.11 days decade -1 ), should have been greater than observed (Fig. 3b). Anthropogenic aerosols and large-scale land use changes reduce the frequency by a rate of -0.49 days decade -1 (-0.79 --0.21 days decade -1 ), offsetting around 30% of GHG-induced increases. The NAT-forced frequency change is negligibly small (0.08 days decade -1 , -0.02-0.18 days decade -1 ).As urbanization forcing is absent in both simulations and rural observations, as the first step, we attribute observed changes in rural-mean frequency using space-time fingerprinting (see Methods).

        <p>It is plausible to expect that the responses to GHG and NAT differ trivially in urban and rural areas at the scale of Eastern China. Hence, the urban-rural contrast in the frequency changes of compound hot extremes should be primarily due to added heat from urbanization (increased surface sensible heat and reduced evaporative cooling from incremental impervious surface), spatially heterogeneous radiative forcings from urban-rural gradient in aerosol loadings 13 and extra forcings related to large-scale land use changes (e.g., widespread deforestation). In view of this, we remove the GHG and NAT-forced frequency changes from the urban-mean series, leaving the residual expressed as a linear combination of OANT-and urbanization-induced (URB) changes (see Methods).It is plausible to expect that the responses to GHG and NAT differ trivially in urban and rural areas at the scale of Eastern China.

        <p>In this residual series, the URB fingerprint (urbanization-induced spatiotemporal changes in frequency) is assumed to scale with urban built-up areas that expanded slowly, steeply and then plateaued gradually over Eastern China, generally following an 'S'-shape pathway 15,25 . We accordingly use the S-shape logistic sigmoid function to model the process (Fig. 2b), and take the fitted part as the URB fingerprint (see Methods). Similar to the fingerprints of large-scale forcings, the URB fingerprint only serves as the first-order approximation, which needs to be further calibrated via 'optimal fingerprinting'.In this residual series, the URB fingerprint (urbanization-induced spatiotemporal changes in frequency) is assumed to scale with urban built-up areas that expanded slowly, steeply and then plateaued gradually over Eastern China, generally following an 'S'-shape pathway 15,25 .

        <p>Considering the URB and OANT forcings, we conduct the second-step detection and attribution with respect to the residual series (see Methods). Both the OANT and URB fingerprints can be detected in the past spatiotemporal evolutions of urban compound hot extremes, with their scaling factors consistent with the unity (Fig. 3a). The OANT-caused reduction in compound hot extremes in cities (-0.54 days decade -1 , 5-95% UR: -0.80 --0.29 days decade -1 ) is around 10% greater than that in rural areas (-0.49 days decade -1 , -0.79 --0.21 days decade -1 ), in line with the expectation of higher aerosol loadings in urban areas causing stronger radiative cooling 13 . Based on the formal attribution, urbanization has increased the event occurrence by 0.51 days decade -1 (0.15-0.88 days decade -1 ), accounting for approximately 29% in the observed increase in urban-mean compound hot extremes. Whilst, the direct observational urban-minus-rural provides an estimate of urbanization-added frequency by 0.42 days decade -1 , underestimating the forcing of urban land expansion by around 18% (0.09 in 0.51).Considering the URB and OANT forcings, we conduct the second-step detection and attribution with respect to the residual series (see Methods).

        <p>Future exposure to urban compound hot extremes. Our analysis confirms that anthropogenic emissions (including GHG and aerosols) and urbanization are the dominant drivers for urban compound hot extremes' changes. Thus, we use observationally constrained MME mean projection plus future urbanization-added increases to estimate anthropogenically-forced frequency changes in future (see Methods). In the near term (before 2050), the frequency increases are largely independent of emissions scenarios; whereas after the mid-21 st century, the choice of scenarios makes a big difference in the magnitude of increases. Under the sustainable scenario-SSP1-2.6, urban compound hot extremes are projected to increase from around 11 days in the 2010s to 26 days in the 2090s (Fig. 4a). By contrast, under a high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), the frequency is expected to reach around 50 days (Fig. 4a). Anthropogenically-forced increases in urban compound hot extremes scale quasi-linearly with global warming levels, with every additional 1°C of global warming translating into extra 10 compound events to occur in the warmer decade, across urban Eastern China (Fig. 4b). Inferred from this significant linear relationship, future GHG-driven global warming may account for as high as 97% of total variance in future frequency increases in urban compound hot extremes there.Future exposure to urban compound hot extremes.

        <p>Apart from heat hazard increases, future risks of summertime compound hot extremes also depend on exposure, i.e., the size and spatiotemporal pattern of population (see Methods). At mid-century under SSP1-2.6, the emission-driven increases in urban compound heat hazards would bring an increase in urban population exposure of 23.5 billion person-days (Fig. 4c), relative to the 2010s level of 6.7 billion person-days. The "hot spots" for the mid-century population exposure are clustered in three large urban agglomerations, namely the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta (Supplementary Fig. 6). Future urban expansions are projected to amplify the emissions-driven surge in population exposure by ~13% (i.e., 3.1 billion person-days) by mid-century. With the expectation of relatively mild increases in summertime compound hot extremes and a peak-then-fall urban population structure under SSP1 (Supplementary Fig. 7), the end-of-century urban population exposure might be lower than the mid-century level (Fig. 4c).Apart from heat hazard increases, future risks of summertime compound hot extremes also depend on exposure, i.e., the size and spatiotemporal pattern of population (see Methods).

        <p>Under SSP5-8.5, GHG emissions and urban land expansion combine to increase urban population exposure by around 42 billion person-days till the end of this century. This is discernably larger than the counterparts under low-to-intermediate emissions (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5; Fig. 4c). In contrast to SSP1-2.6, the emission-driven increase in heat hazards under SSP5-8.5 dominates over demographic changes in driving future growth in urban population exposure (Fig. 4c). Thus, moving to net-zero GHG emissions sooner rather than later has the potential of offering a huge health co-benefit.Under SSP5-8.5, GHG emissions and urban land expansion combine to increase urban population exposure by around 42 billion person-days till the end of this century.

        <p>For rural areas, future population exposure will decrease under most scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5; Supplementary Fig. 8) due mainly to population migration to urban areas (Supplementary Fig. 7c).For rural areas, future population exposure will decrease under most scenarios (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5; Supplementary Fig. 8) due mainly to population migration to urban areas (Supplementary Fig. 7c).</p>
        <p>However, following a regional rivalry pathway with low priority for addressing global environmental issues (SSP3-7.0), the exposure of rural population in Eastern China, who have less access to adaptation facilities (such as air conditioning) and have to work outdoors for longer time, will also increase during the course of this century (Supplementary Fig. 8), though the magnitude is much smaller than in urban areas.However, following a regional rivalry pathway with low priority for addressing global environmental issues (SSP3-7.0), the exposure of rural population in Eastern China, who have less access to adaptation facilities (such as air conditioning) and have to work outdoors for longer time, will also increase during the course of this century (Supplementary Fig. 8), though the magnitude is much smaller than in urban areas.</p>
        <p>Our results quantitatively confirm that day-night compound hot extremes are more damaging to human health than daytime-and nighttime-only events, especially to female and older (≥ 75 years old) urban residents. Fingerprints of both anthropogenic emissions (GHG and aerosols) and regional-unique urbanization are detected in increasing compound hot extremes over urban Eastern China, with GHG contributing most. The same methodological framework estimates the urbanization contribution at around 29%.

Future anthropogenic emissions, continuing urbanization and demographic variations, together, lead to an approximately three-to-sixfold increase in population exposure to compound heat across urban Eastern China by the end of the 21 st century.</p>
        <p>We avoided using the traditional single-step fingerprinting method to disentangle the signature of urbanization from GHG-dominated anthropogenic warming, since the space-time responses of hot extremes to them are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.95) over Eastern China. This is determined by the statistical nature of the optimal fingerprinting method-multivariate linear regression, in which the multicollinearity of predictors (i.e., high correlations among fingerprints) could bias the estimate for the magnitude and significance of regression coefficients (i.e., scaling factor and uncertainty range, and accordingly the detectability and attributable fraction) 24 . We employed the variance inflation factor 27 (VIFs; see Methods) to formally measure the degree of multicollinearity among the fingerprints. As shown in Supplementary Table 3, aligning GHG and URB in a single step would yield VIFs over 10, indicative of an unacceptably high level of multicollinearity 28 . Alternatively, considering GHG+NAT+OANT, and OANT+URB separately, as we did in the newly-devised framework, restricts the multicollinearity to a reasonably low level. As a result, when considering regional-specific non-GHG forcings, the stepwise framework might be a more generalized mode.We avoided using the traditional single-step fingerprinting method to disentangle the signature of urbanization from GHG-dominated anthropogenic warming, since the space-time responses of hot extremes to them are strongly correlated (r&gt;0.95) over Eastern China.

        <p>The method design and result interpretation for detection and attribution of urbanization-like localized forcings also depend critically on explicit framing of the spatial scale. We here addressed the detectability and contribution of urbanization to changes in urban-mean event frequency, rather than the regional-mean (urban and rural combined) series. To illustrate the difference, we similarly employed the stepwise framework to the regional-mean frequency of compound hot extremes (Supplementary Fig. 9), with the URB fingerprint constructed as the difference between the regional series and rural series. In the regional increase of 1.48 days decade -1 (90% CI: 1.09-1.84 days decade -1 ), URB can no longer be detected (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Therefore, it should be articulated that the signature of urbanization is only detectable in changes of urban compound hot extremes, but is still too weak to be detected in regional-mean changes over Eastern China.The method design and result interpretation for detection and attribution of urbanization-like localized forcings also depend critically on explicit framing of the spatial scale.

        <p>Though the considered regional expansion of urban impervious surfaces is the main driver for UHI effects 29 , the attributed and projected urbanization-induced increases in compound hot extremes should be communicated as conservative estimates. Other unaccounted city-dependent factors, such as urban morphological characteristics, urban anthropogenic heat (e.g., waste heat from air conditioning), aerosol reductions in cities 30 and potential nonlinear interactions between hot extremes and UHI 31 , may also modulate the local UHI magnitude. Changes in strength of land-atmosphere feedbacks and in frequency of hot extreme-producing synoptic weather regimes might introduce additional uncertainty in simulating the coupling of daytime and nighttime temperature [32][33][34] , thus propagating into future projections.Though the considered regional expansion of urban impervious surfaces is the main driver for UHI effects 29 , the attributed and projected urbanization-induced increases in compound hot extremes should be communicated as conservative estimates.

        <p>Regarding the health impact, though we moved a step forward in distinguishing compound hot extremes from singular hot days or nights, the inconsistency in the observing and archiving conventions of temperature and mortality data prohibits us from making further distinction amongst different compound sequences, i.e., midnight-to-afternoon, afternoon-to-midnight and midnight-afternoon-midnight (see Definition of summertime hot extremes). Long-term hourly temperature records, alongside hourly-to-subdaily mortality records, would allow to precisely match specific sequence of compound heat with the after-exposure health consequences 3,20,35,36 . Also worth further exploration is the added health burden from the duration dimension of compound hot extremes, which requests longer-period mortality data to match even rarer multi-day compound heat waves.Regarding the health impact, though we moved a step forward in distinguishing compound hot extremes from singular hot days or nights, the inconsistency in the observing and archiving conventions of temperature and mortality data prohibits us from making further distinction amongst different compound sequences, i.e., midnight-to-afternoon, afternoon-to-midnight and midnight-afternoon-midnight (see Definition of summertime hot extremes).

        <p>We report that the public health risks from anthropogenic increases in compound hot extremes have been increasing, and will continue to increase over urban Eastern China. The uncovered age-specific vulnerability to compound hot extremes implies further elevated health burden due to rapid ageing of urban population there. Therefore, adapting to and mitigating climate change in the urban context will achieve co-benefits and synergies between reducing heat-related health risks and getting to the committed net-zero emission goals.We report that the public health risks from anthropogenic increases in compound hot extremes have been increasing, and will continue to increase over urban Eastern China.

        <p>Data. Observational climatic records and land use data. We used daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature observations over 1961-2014 from 2,474 meteorological stations in China 37 . The dataset was compiled and quality-controlled by the China Meteorological Data Service Center, and was homogenized using the 
            <rs type="software">RHtestsV</rs>
            <rs type="version">3</rs> software package 38 . Stations with five or more Tmax/Tmin records missing in any summer (i.e., June, July, and August) were discarded, giving us a total of 1,788 stations over Eastern China. Individual missing values were infilled by the average of neighboring two days.
        </p>
        <p>To classify urban and rural stations, we used temporally evolving land use/land cover (LULC) maps of China, generated via the Landsat 
            <rs type="software">Thematic Mapper</rs>/Enhanced 
            <rs type="software">Thematic Mapper</rs> satellite images at a 30m resolution 39 . These LULC maps were provided at six representative years: 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010, each of which was accordingly used to represent six periods (1961-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2014) (Supplementary Fig. 10). The period-specific built-up area was measured by the end-year LULC map, except for that of the last episode using the 2010 map. The built-up lands include urban facilities and infrastructures, predominately residential, industrial, commercial, and institutional lands in cities, counties and towns 40 , with a tiny proportion comprising suburban and rural settlements surrounding cities 40 .

        <p>Climate model simulations. We used daily Tmax and Tmin outputs from global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) 41 , including historical simulations forced by anthropogenic plus natural forcings (ALL), greenhouse gases forcing only (GHG), and natural forcings only (NAT; solar activities and volcanic aerosols). To extract the forcing signals through averaging out randomly phased realizations of internal variability, we required each model to have at least three ensemble members providing daily Tmax and Tmin simulations in each forcing experiment. This sorts out eight models (Supplementary Table 4), which also provide projected variables in at least one ensemble member under four CMIP6 Tier-1 emissions scenarios driven by various socioeconomic assumptions called shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). We also used unforced pre-industrial control (piControl) simulations from 17 models.Climate model simulations.

        <p>Mortality records. We used daily counts (00:00-24:00) of non-accidental mortality records in 98 death surveillance points distributed in five provinces (Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Guangdong) and four municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing). These surveillance points well cover major urban agglomerations in Eastern China (Supplementary Fig. 10). The mortality records of Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces during 2013-2017 were obtained from the respective Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Data for other provinces and municipalities during 2006-2011 were collected from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. These records follow the same reporting and certificating protocols 42 . According to the International Classification of Diseases-10 th Revision (ICD-10), non-accidental deaths, coded as A00-R99, resulted from diseases rather than from injuries (traffic related mortalities, suicide, drowning, etc.). Considering that age-and gender-dependent physiological and socio-economic status might alter the community's vulnerability to heat exposure, daily deaths were further grouped by sex and age (0-64, 65-74, and ≥75 years old), respectively.

        <p>Future population and urban land expansion. We used spatially explicit global urban and rural population projections provided at a spacing of 0.125° for every decade of 2010-2100 43 . This demographic dataset is quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections under different SSPs. We used urban land projections 25 under various SSPs at a spatial resolution of 1 km and decadal intervals for 2020-2100 to estimate future changes in grid-level (5°×5°) urban fraction. The future urban extent was estimated by the 'Future Land-Use Simulation' model, which takes advantage of machine learning and cellular automata to account for population size, urbanization rate (ratio of urban population to total population) and gross domestic product 25 .Future population and urban land expansion.

        <p>Definition of summertime hot extremes. We determined a hot day/night when Tmax/Tmin is higher than the 90 th percentile of its long-term counterparts (1961-1990). The daily-based percentile was calculated from a time window of 15 days centered on each calendar day over 1961-1990 (i.e., total daily samples: 15×30=450 days). The 90 th percentile serves as a proper compromise between the event extremity and sample size for trend analysis, and also captures the possibility of relatively-moderate extremes combining to cause huge impacts.Definition of summertime hot extremes.

        <p>By the temperature observing and archiving protocol (yesterday's 20:00 to today's 20:00), daily minima appear in the early morning of the day (02:00) and thus precede daily maxima (14:00). That is, the temperature dataset, providing only Tmin and Tmax, under-samples the evening-to-midnight temperatures, but the daily count of mortality is an accumulation from 00:00 to 24:00. To better match the type of hot extremes (exposure) to mortality (after-exposure consequences), we divided a day into three subperiods, i.e., early morning (midnight to sunrise), daytime (sunrise to sunset), and nighttime (sunset to midnight), which are measured by Tmin of the day (Tmin 0 ), Tmax of the day (Tmax 0 ) and Tmin of the next day (Tmin 1 ), respectively. The unavailability of hourly temperature records compels us to take Tmin 1 as a surrogate of today's evening-to-midnight temperature, considering the good continuity of temperature within a few hours.By the temperature observing and archiving protocol (yesterday's 20:00 to today's 20:00), daily minima appear in the early morning of the day (02:00) and thus precede daily maxima (14:00).

        <p>Three types of summertime hot extremes are accordingly defined as: (i) daytime-only hot extreme-an extremely hot day neither preceded nor followed by hot nights (i.e., Tmax 0 ˃90 th percentile, Tmin 0 ≤90 th percentile and Tmin 1 ≤90 th percentile); (ii) nighttime-only hot extreme-extremely hot in the early morning or/and in the following night, but normal during daytime (i.e., Tmax 0 ≤90 th percentile, and Tmin 0 or/and Tmin 1 ˃90 th percentile); (iii) compound hot extreme-sustained hot event combining extremely elevated daytime (Tmax 0 ) and nighttime (Tmin 0 or/and Tmin 1 ) temperatures (i.e., Tmax 0 ˃90th percentile, and Tmin 0 or/and Tmin 1 ˃90 th percentile).Three types of summertime hot extremes are accordingly defined as: (i) daytime-only hot extreme-an extremely hot day neither preceded nor followed by hot nights (i.e., Tmax 0 ˃90 th percentile, Tmin 0 ≤90 th percentile and Tmin 1 ≤90 th percentile); (ii) nighttime-only hot extreme-extremely hot in the early morning or/and in the following night, but normal during daytime (i.e., Tmax 0 ≤90 th percentile, and Tmin 0 or/and Tmin 1 ˃90 th percentile); (iii) compound hot extreme-sustained hot event combining extremely elevated daytime (Tmax 0 ) and nighttime (Tmin 0 or/and Tmin 1 ) temperatures (i.e., Tmax 0 ˃90th percentile, and Tmin 0 or/and Tmin 1 ˃90 th percentile).</p>
        <p>Excess mortality attributed to summertime hot extremes. We first employed a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) with quasi-Poisson distribution 44 to establish the hot extremes-mortality relationship in each death surveillance point. Daily counts of deaths were considered as the dependent variable, and the occurrence of hot extremes was used as the predictor (days seeing no hot extremes set as reference for comparison and referred to as normal days). We then introduced a cross-basis function in the DLNM to model the non-linear and lag effects of hot extremes on deaths, with the maximum lag set as 1 day 45 . We controlled long-term trends, relative humidity, and the day-of-week effect as potential confounders in the DLNM. We then performed a multivariate meta-regression to pool the location-specific exposure-response association 46 . Observed Tmax and Tmin in the station nearest to the death surveillance location were used to represent surface air temperatures there. In order to test the robustness of our findings, we also conducted sensitivity analysis accounting for 3-, 5-and 7-day lags instead. The shown association as measured by relative risks, calculated by summing contributions at different lags 44 , refers to cumulative effects of hot extremes of certain type on mortality over the whole lag period. Technical details of the DLNM model could be found in Supplementary Note 1 and ref. 44.Excess mortality attributed to summertime hot extremes.

        <p>Classification of urban and rural stations. We classified urban and rural stations in Eastern China (15-55°N; 100-135°E) using the LULC maps. Following previous studies 47 , we set up a buffer zone of 2 km radius around each station to estimate the fraction of neighbouring built-up areas. We considered a station as an urban one if the built-up land fraction surrounding it is greater than 33% 47 . A station was determined to be rural if its neighbouring built-up fraction remained below 33% throughout the analysis period (1961-2014). Thus, urban stations were dynamically classified over time. By these criteria, only 314 stations across Eastern China were classified into urban in 1980 (Supplementary Fig. 11); while the number reached 972 by 2010 as urbanization accelerated since then 48 . This dynamic classification scheme captures both the expansion of pre-existing cities and the rural-urban transformation (Supplementary Fig. 10), thus better characterizing the forcing from regional urbanization processes.Classification of urban and rural stations.

        <p>Urban-rural contrast in summertime hot extremes. To estimate the urban-rural difference in frequency of hot extremes, we divided Eastern China into thirty 5°×5° latitude-longitude grid cells. For each grid cell, we first calculated the event frequency at individual stations, and then arithmetically averaged the frequency amongst all urban (rural) stations within that grid to derive the grid-level urban (rural) frequency. To eliminate potential topographical effects on grid values, we excluded the stations whose altitude became 500m higher than the lowest station within the same grid during the rural-urban transformation. Further, we constructed urban-/rural-mean frequency series of summertime hot extremes by averaging grid values of urban/rural frequency weighted by the cosine of their central latitudes.Urban-rural contrast in summertime hot extremes.

Considering spatially heterogenous levels of urbanization and aerosol concentrations, we divided Eastern China into three sub-regions: southeastern China (15-30°N; 100-125°E), central-eastern China (30-40°N; 100-125°E) and northeastern China (40-55°N; 100-135°E).

        <p>For the urbanization fingerprint (URB), we constructed it by fitting the observed series of urban-rural frequency difference in each sub-region with the logistic sigmoid function, a good simulator of an 'S'-shape process (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 12).

        <p>To reduce high frequency variability, we pre-processed the 54-year domain-averaged observational vectors (i.e., Y OBS_R and Y OBS_U ) and fingerprint series (i.e., X ANT , X NAT , X GHG , X OANT and X URB ) for each sub-region into non-overlapping 3-year-mean frequency series (i.e., 18 samples). Concatenating three sub-region series successively produced a 54-dimensional observational series and a set of 54-dimensional fingerprints that characterized the space-time response patterns used in Eqs. ( 1), (2), and (4). We also repeated these calculations by using non-overlapping five-year-mean series (11 samples, i.e., 10 five-year averages plus the average of four additional years) instead.To reduce high frequency variability, we pre-processed the 54-year domain-averaged observational vectors (i.e., Y OBS_R and Y OBS_U ) and fingerprint series (i.e., X ANT , X NAT , X GHG , X OANT and X URB ) for each sub-region into non-overlapping 3-year-mean frequency series (i.e., 18 samples).

        <p>To solve the above regression models and also conduct residual consistency test, we used the outputs of unforced piControl simulations to construct two independent estimates for inversed variance-covariance matrix of the internal variability ( ), each of which comprised 89 non-overlapping segments with equal length to the analysis period (Supplementary Table 4). By design, the internal variability-related sampling uncertainty of fingerprints is inversely proportional to the number of model runs driven by specific forcings.To solve the above regression models and also conduct residual consistency test, we used the outputs of unforced piControl simulations to construct two independent estimates for inversed variance-covariance matrix of the internal variability ( ), each of which comprised 89 non-overlapping segments with equal length to the analysis period (Supplementary Table 4).

        <p>Whilst, given no urbanization-forced experiment, the URB fingerprint was constructed purely by observation via fitting urban-rural frequency differences. This practice smoothed out most internal variability, and consequently the associated sampling uncertainty was reasonably small. This motived us to artificially specify very large number of "model runs" (i.e., 1,000), in the calculation, to estimate the URB scaling factor. Additional sampling uncertainty in the URB signal related to the station selection and classification are detailed in Supplementary Discussion 2 and shown in Supplementary Fig. 12.Whilst, given no urbanization-forced experiment, the URB fingerprint was constructed purely by observation via fitting urban-rural frequency differences.

        <p>A certain external forcing is deemed detectable in observed changes if the uncertainty range of its scaling factor excludes zero. If the uncertainty range encompasses the unity, the forced pattern is considered consistent with the observation. We conducted a standard residual consistency test to check the validity of the regression fitting. Passing this test means the estimated residuals in the regression models is generally consistent with the assumed internal variability in magnitude. All the regression models used have passed this test at the 0.05 significance level. Based on it, we quantified frequency changes attributable to a given external forcing by multiplying the linear trend of the corresponding fingerprint with the scaling factor (best estimate and uncertainty range).A certain external forcing is deemed detectable in observed changes if the uncertainty range of its scaling factor excludes zero.

        <p>Observationally constrained projections. Assuming that the historical overestimation/underestimation in the responsive changes (signified by below-unity/above-unity scaling factors) would propagate into the future, we leveraged the attribution results to constrain projections. For the historical period, we reconstructed the simulated frequency anomalies (relative to 1961-2014) of urban compound hot extremes by summing the optimally scaled (multiply respective scaling factors) signals of GHG, OANT, NAT and URB. For the future period (after 2014), we similarly scaled the raw projections of MME mean frequency anomalies and the raw projections of future urbanization-added frequency, by the scaling factors of ANT and URB (see the section below). These optimally scaled future responses were then added up, and further adjusted by the magnitude of difference between the reconstructed and observed historical means (Fig. 4a).Observationally constrained projections.

        <p>Population exposure to summertime compound hot extremes. We projected population exposure to summertime compound hot extremes, in the unit of person-days, by multiplying the number of events with the number of people exposed. Specifically, for urban/rural areas in each 5°×5° grid, we calculated the decadal-mean frequency (e.g., 2005-2014 for the 2010s, 2015-2024 for the 2020s, and so on) of compound hot extremes and multiplied it by the total urban/rural population in that grid cell for the decade. Raw projections of compound hot extremes do not account for frequency increases due to future urban expansion.Population exposure to summertime compound hot extremes.
