        <p>Circular Economy (CE) is the buzzword of today, promising an economy able to prosper on limited resources by closing material cycles. However, there is no guarantee that simple strategies of material cycling, as propagated by the various definitions of this concept, will indeed lead to an economy able to manage the world's resources, pollution and societal demand within environmentally sustainable levels. Based on the shortcomings of the present mainstream definitions of CE, this paper proposes an integrative, cascading, resource-based approach aimed at an environmentally sustainable and socially beneficial economy. The international community agrees on the necessity to maintain the current environmental equilibrium to ensure equity for future generations and to allow human well-being and dignity already in the present. Accordingly, physical and environmental limitations are identified, that are to be observed to make CE sustainable. This paper then suggests that a transition towards a sustainable resource-based CE goes hand in hand with a paradigm shift in the way environmental considerations are perceived by individuals, codified in different normative frameworks and dealt with by private companies. It therefore opens the discussion by underlying some challenges that could appear in the view of transitioning to CE.Circular Economy (CE) is the buzzword of today, promising an economy able to prosper on limited resources by closing material cycles.

        <p>The concept of Circular Economy (CE) has recently gained broad diffusion and popularity, in particular in the policy and business circles in developed nations, promising an economy which can be both profitable and sustainable (Korhonen et al., 2018a;Lazarevic and Valve, 2017;Veleva and Bodkin, 2018). The growing amount of peer-reviewed articles on CE and various publications by major consulting firms are reflecting that CE is also becoming an important concept for science and business development (Kirchherr et al., 2017;Reike et al., 2017). As its name suggests, CE refers to a model of production and consumption that introduces a fundamentally different perspective from the dominant "linear economy" model (Sauvé et al., 2016); it is often presented as an alternative to the current "take-make-dispose" or "extract-produce-consume-trash" industrial model (among many others: Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015); Ghisellini et al. (2016)). By conceiving end-of-life materials and products as resources rather than waste, it aims at closing the loops of materials, reducing the need for raw materials and waste disposal, following the example of ecosystems (Elia et al., 2017).The concept of Circular Economy (CE) has recently gained broad diffusion and popularity, in particular in the policy and business circles in developed nations, promising an economy which can be both profitable and sustainable (Korhonen et al., 2018a;Lazarevic and Valve, 2017;Veleva and Bodkin, 2018).

        <p>Despite its wide use, there is however no consent on what CE actually means and encompasses, not to speak of an agreed definition (Lieder and Rashid, 2016;Reike et al., 2017). The widespread acceptance of a somewhat not clearly defined concept, often presented as a solution for continuous economic growth and innovation withoutor with minimaldamaging exploitation of the environment (e.g. Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015); European Commission (2014)), can be explained through the benefits and interests of the actors driving the CE to actively support such a deliberately vague, but therefore uncontroversial approach (Lazarevic and Valve, 2017). The lack of conceptual clarity and an accepted definition represents a challenge for scholars to work on the topic given the abundance of CE conceptualizations, which has been described as "circular economy babble" by Kirchherr et al. (2017); it led Blomsma and Brennan (2017) to qualify CE as an "umbrella concept" and Korhonen et al. (2018b) as an essentially contested concept.Despite its wide use, there is however no consent on what CE actually means and encompasses, not to speak of an agreed definition (Lieder and Rashid, 2016;Reike et al., 2017).

        <p>This paper doesn't intend to offer another literature review of existing definitions, as this has already been done by different authors (see for an overview, e.g., Geissdoerfer et al. (2017); Ghisellini et al. (2016); Homrich et al. (2018); International Reference Centre for the Life Cycle of Products Processes and Services (CIRAIG), 2015; Kirchherr et al. (2017); Korhonen et al. (2018b); Lieder and Rashid (2016); Winans et al. (2017); Merli et al. (2018)). Based on an evaluation of these various reviews in section 2, it presents a conceptual framework that allows to integrate multiple CE strategies focusing on individual actors (micro-level) into a global and resourced-based approach. Building on a large consensus that an environment permitting a life of dignity and well-being should be ensured for current and future generations (section 3.3), it places environmental realities at the core of the here proposed approach (see section 3.4), which leads to the resourcebased definition in section 3.5. Section 4 shortly addresses how the integration of these physical requirements into socio-economic activities represents a paradigm shift for all actors (e.g., consumers, institutions, private companies) and discusses some related challenges, with a particular focus on the legal systemillustrated in the Swiss contextand the economic actors.This paper doesn't intend to offer another literature review of existing definitions, as this has already been done by different authors (see for an overview, e.g., Geissdoerfer et al.

        <p>As mentioned already above, there is no single definition of what CE means and encompasses. The most often cited and probably best known definition of CE of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (see supporting information (SI) and Ellen MacArthur Foundation ( 2013)), which focuses on regenerative economy and new business models, has been adopted and modified many times (Kirchherr et al., 2017), also by political actors and for institutional positions (e.g., British Standard (2017); European Commission (2014); United Nations Environmental Program (2006), see also SI). Other definitions, mostly stemming from scientific literature, rather focus on material aspects (Bocken et al., 2017) or consolidate various definitions to be found in the recent literature into more comprehensive ones (e.g. Kirchherr et al. (2017); Korhonen et al. (2018a)).As mentioned already above, there is no single definition of what CE means and encompasses.

        <p>The mentioned understandings of CE are mostly adopting a bottomup approach, focusing on individual businesses and economic actors. They encourage them to improve their efficiency, reducing the (perunit) resource input and minimizing final waste. These approaches are useful and necessary, as they provide tools for single actors to adapt their processes and help operationalizing theoretical principles; hence they certainly play an essential role in the transition towards CE. Such strategies can also be interesting from a pure business perspective, as they make companies less dependent on resource price fluctuations and strengthen customer loyalty thanks to new business models.The mentioned understandings of CE are mostly adopting a bottomup approach, focusing on individual businesses and economic actors.

        <p>Despite its usefulness for direct application, such bottom-up approaches are not per se sufficient to reach sustainability. There is no proof that material-cycling strategies would be environmentally sustainable after all (Grosse, 2010(Grosse, , 2011;;Zink and Geyer, 2017), as the idea of closing cycles alone does not touch the question on how large and fast such cycles can be (Cullen, 2017;Merli et al., 2018). Bottom-up approaches can lead to a confusion between different levels of analysis (micro, meso, macro) 1 and a lack of distinction between relative and absolute efficiency (Gregson et al., 2015;Hobson, 2016;Lazarevic and Valve, 2017). Indeed, most approaches focusing on production, production sites and techniques are aiming at improving per-unit efficiency but disregard a larger macroeconomic and macro-societal approach, which is necessary to build "authentic" circularity (Arnsperger and Bourg, 2017;Ferrari, 2017). By neglecting that CE can be conceived and implemented at different scales, they lack a systemic view on the global context of limited environmental resources (Korhonen et al., 2018a).Despite its usefulness for direct application, such bottom-up approaches are not per se sufficient to reach sustainability.

        <p>CE is often presented as a solution to overcome the tension between unlimited economic growth and finite planetary resources with no further explanation. It is implicitly assumed that improving the efficiency of businesses at the micro level will reduce the global environmental impact of businesses, neglecting the impact of continuous growth. Some authors refer to it as the "myth of decoupling" growth and resource consumption (Lazarevic and Valve, 2017). Grosse (2010) argues that in an economy where resource use is growing by more than 1 %, the positive effects of recycling on resource depletion are negligible. CE is seen as an enabler to economic growth (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015), but in order to result in an absolute decoupling of resource use from GDP growth (Jackson, 2011), the growth would need to be linked to resource efficiency improvements (Kjaer et al., 2018). It is assumed that proposed strategies of material cycling will replace 1:1 primary production, which is a gross oversimplification. On the market, an increase in supply (initial primary production and recycled secondary production) usually leads to a decrease in price and, subsequently, to an increase in consumption (Zink and Geyer, 2017). This may in many cases lead to an increase of environmental impacts and create a "rebound effect" (Figge et al., 2014;Ghisellini et al., 2016). As mentioned, reducing the environmental impact per produced unit will not necessarily reduce the environmental impact of the economy as a whole, if the questions of the number of actors and the number of units produced per actor are neglected. The Institutional Resource Regime approach (Gerber et al., 2009;Knoepfel et al., 2007), the institutional economics approach of environmental policies (Bromley, 1991) or the Institutional Analysis and Development framework (Ostrom, 1990(Ostrom, , 2009) ) have pointed out the theoretical limits and weaknesses of "classical" sectoral emission control-based environmental policy approaches when dealing with the issue of sustainable resource management.CE is often presented as a solution to overcome the tension between unlimited economic growth and finite planetary resources with no further explanation.

        <p>Regarding material flows, it is commonly assumed that engineering materials can be cycled indefinitely in technical applications, disregarding irreversible effects, as well as technological and even physical limitations (Korhonen et al., 2018a;Winans et al., 2017). It is however inevitable that materials are irretrievably lost during the lifetime of technical products (Kral et al., 2013;Valero, 2006). Thus sustainable raw material extraction (Bocken et al., 2017) and safe disposal in final sinks (Kral et al., 2013) are necessary parts of a CE, yet they are rarely included in current approaches.Regarding material flows, it is commonly assumed that engineering materials can be cycled indefinitely in technical applications, disregarding irreversible effects, as well as technological and even physical limitations (Korhonen et al., 2018a;Winans et al., 2017).

        <p>Even if there is no clear evidence of a single origin of the term (Murray et al., 2015;Winans et al., 2017), the paradigm of CE was surely rooted in a reflection around the concepts of environmental science and sustainable development (Ghisellini et al., 2016;Sauvé et al., 2016). Approaches like, e.g., industrial ecology (Ehrenfeld, 1997;Erkman, 1997), clean technology (Clift, 1995(Clift, , 1997)), cradle-to-cradle™ (Braungart et al., 2007), blue economy (Pauli, 2009), performance economy (Stahel and Reday-Mulvey, 1981) or biomimicry (Kennedy et al., 2015) share the idea of the systemic view on "spaceship earth" (Boulding, 1966) with limited resources. The development of different strategies to manage the resource flows in an essentially closed system was the result of the awareness that our planet is such a (almost) closed system.Even if there is no clear evidence of a single origin of the term (Murray et al., 2015;Winans et al., 2017), the paradigm of CE was surely rooted in a reflection around the concepts of environmental science and sustainable development (Ghisellini et al., 2016;Sauvé et al., 2016).

        <p>The concept of CE can, to some extent, be described through some of its components or strategies (like, e.g., reusing, recycling, eco-design and performance economy), but this is not sufficient to define it, if we aim for a socio-economic system that is sustainable from a resourcebased point of view. To be complete, the components have to be seen as 1 To add to the confusion, there is no accepted standard in the distinction between the different scales labelled as micro, meso and macro respectively (see e.g. (Ghisellini et al., 2016)). parts of the larger system, or "ecosystem" (Laurenti et al., 2018). Then so far, CE has not been systematically thought in a holistic and topdown manner, taking the planetary environmental constraints as the absolute limits of the system (Korhonen et al., 2018a). Our intent is therefore to develop a framework based on this understanding. The resulting global and systemic approach is a tribute to various authors and schools of thought (see Table 1) that have contributed to the emergence and development of the CE concept. This framework will allow to acknowledge the pragmatic utility of bottom-up and sectorial approaches, while overcoming the shortcomings of current definitions, as identified in section 2. After presenting the conceptual construction of the framework (section 3.1) and its epistemological status (section 3.2), we will develop the theoretical basis of the framework by first showing the development and foundations of the normative assumptions on which it is built (section 3.3) and then identifying the physical and environmental principles and limitations that have to be taken into account and how they translate to CE (section 3.4).

        <p>To illustrate the theoretical concepts, we discuss the application of the findings and derive guidelines for practical consideration on a company or product level on the example of a washing machine. We will show qualitatively, how the different aspects can be considered in the design of the washing machine (section 3.4), its business model (section 4.3) and relate to the larger policy and societal frame (section 4.2). The example is based on the outputs of various discussions and workshops with a home appliance-company in Switzerland.To illustrate the theoretical concepts, we discuss the application of the findings and derive guidelines for practical consideration on a company or product level on the example of a washing machine.

        <p>Our human societies are part of the Earth system; they are organized along normative principles, which can vary depending on cultures, religions and other moral considerations. Nowadays, there is however a global consensus on the fact that human dignity and well-being should be seen as an overall goal of any system developed by humans, while ensuring that the existence conditions of the system are not destroyed. We take this normative consensus as the basis of our CE framework and therefore aim for a CE that acknowledges the need of a sustainable resource management, in order to allow human dignity for current and further generations (see section 3.3).Our human societies are part of the Earth system; they are organized along normative principles, which can vary depending on cultures, religions and other moral considerations.

        <p>The universe is organized along physical laws, which lead to the unique distribution of energy, and consequently matter, in space and time. These principles limit the possibilities for all natural, but also all technical processes. The Earth system provides vital ecosystem services to humanity, but has a limited resilience against anthropogenic stressors. These boundaries of the planet and the physical limits combined should be considered as the overall frame for human activity, in order not to trigger unintended anthropogenic changes in the Earth system.

        <p>Our contribution relies on an inclusive and integrative approach, allowing to place the usefulbut incompleteindividual perspectives into a larger frame. We conceived it as an "ideal-type" (see Weber, 1997 and SI), which represents a clear theoretical ideal version of a concept, a "north star" that helps orientation. In such an ideal-typical perspective, according to Weber, the conceptual challenge relies on identifying and caricaturing the significant and relevant (system of) features of the (social) phenomenon being studied (see SI). The methodological procedure then consists of confronting and measuring the divergence or, on the contrary, the congruence between the ideal-type or Gedankenbild (i.e. our systemic definition of CE) and the empirical cases studied (i.e. various CE situations or transition processes). Such an analytical construct can act as an ideal reference point for assessing progress and measuring efficiency of initiatives towards CE, allowing to analyze and qualifyand possibly even quantifythe degree of "circularity".

        <p>The idea of Earth system limitations to human activities has led to the development of a multitude of approaches to describe the Earth system capacity in ecological terms (Sabag-Munoz and Gladek, 2017). Among the most frequently used are the planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2009;Steffen et al., 2015) and the ecological footprint (Wackernagel et al., 1999). The basic idea behind such approaches is that all collective human activities need to be within the bio-physical capacity of our one and only planet in order to ensure its viability for humans in the long run.

        <p>On a limited planet, the total amount of any resource is limited. Considering the vastness of the planet, human operation may appear insignificant compared with these absolute physical limits. For example, the Earth system receives a total energy flux from the sun of ∼10 17 W (Szargut, 2003), whereas primary energy demand of humans in 2015 is with ∼10 13 W (International Energy Agency, 2018) four orders of magnitude smaller. However, such an analysis is greatly misleading, as it disregards the resource requirements and emissionabsorbing capacity of the Earth system (Desing et al., 2019). Thus it is necessary to have a sound understanding of the share of the Earth's physical resources which are sustainably available for human appropriation.On a limited planet, the total amount of any resource is limited.

        <p>The scientific description of the Earth system is based on modelling, abstraction and empirical calibration, which creates uncertainties.

Theoretically, the uncertainties will be zero when the models become as complex and complete as reality itself (Popper, 1968). Models are often used to describe and predicts a system's behavior, where the mean outcome (50 % probability) and the associated uncertainty range are of interest.The scientific description of the Earth system is based on modelling, abstraction and empirical calibration, which creates uncertainties.

        <p>Considering the global scale of human operations, the Earth's resources and emission absorbing capacity can no longer be approximated as infinite.

This is to ensure that, despite all uncertainties, there is a high probability that the ecosystem can sustain the socioeconomic system for generations to come. Following this logic, planetary capacities need to be determined at the lower end of the uncertainty range, as it is done, e.g., in the planetary boundaries framework (Rockström et al., 2009;Steffen et al., 2015), and environmental loads on the upper end of the uncertainty range, as it is done, e.g., in risk assessment of chemicals (Gottschalk and Nowack, 2013;Van Leewuen and Hermens, 1995).Considering the global scale of human operations, the Earth's resources and emission absorbing capacity can no longer be approximated as infinite.

        <p>The current state of the Earth system is the only one, where we know for certain, that it can support human societies (Steffen et al., 2015). Ecosystems, however, have a limited resilience against human influence and it is necessary to respect their resilience boundaries in order to maintain their functionality (Rockström et al., 2009). Biophysical boundaries have been observed for many variables on a regional (e.g., sustainable forestry (Thomas and Packham, 2007)) as well as global scale (e.g., biodiversity (Mace et al., 2014), net primary production (Running, 2012)). The planetary boundary approach (Rockström et al., 2009;Steffen et al., 2015) identified nine boundary categories, which are essential to Earth system integrity: Climate change, change of biosphere integrity, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean acidification, bio-chemical flows, land-system change, freshwater use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and introduction of novel entities, respectively.

        <p>Let's consider our washing machine example. The outer panels can be made from different materials (e.g., plastics, coated steel sheet, stainless steel…). For a sustainable-circular washing machine, the materials would need to be chosen in regard to their global sustainable availability, considering resource utilization parameter like recyclability and lifetime of parts (which includes reuse, remanufacture and repair). Besides the comparison of different material alternatives, the absolute resource availability in relation to current global production indicates how much resource use needs to be reduced (or can be still increased) to become environmentally sustainable. Such targets can be considered in the design of product systems, such as a washing machine. It provides an indication on how much the resource intensity of the service "washing" would need to be reduced to become sustainable on a global scale, if the demand is assumed to be constant. It can also be used to set targets for industrial sectors and countries to reduce their absolute resource use, as it is attempted for CO 2 in the science based targets initiative (Pineda et al., 2015).Let's consider our washing machine example.

        <p>Even though energy is conserved, only such energy conversions are possible where the entropy increases. Consequently, there are more or less useful forms of energy and its useful content can be described as exergy (Ayres et al., 1996;Connelly, 1997). Every conversion process decreases the exergy content, i.e. exergy is destroyed (Connelly, 1997;Shukuya, 2013). Entropy correlates to the probability of a system to appear in a particular state (Stephan et al., 2009). A high state of order (e.g., a crystal structure) is less likely than a low state of order (e.g., random distribution of molecules in gases). Thus the entropy is low, when the order is high and vice versa. It is possible to increase the order in a specific part of the system, such as in the refinement of iron ore to steel. However, this requires useful work (i.e. exergy) and in the overall system the orderliness decreases.Even though energy is conserved, only such energy conversions are possible where the entropy increases.

        <p>In a production process, raw material with high entropy is refined through the employment of exergy into a product with low entropy (i.e. high order). In the use phase of the product, the entropy increases and, to restore the initial order, it again requires exergy (see Fig. 4). Every change in the entropy level in a product leads to entropy production in the overall system and thus decreases the usefulness of its resources. Consequently, the first fundamental requirement for CE is:In a production process, raw material with high entropy is refined through the employment of exergy into a product with low entropy (i.e. high order).

Reuse of parts or products without any changes requires no change in the entropy level of the material, whereas refurbish and recycle result in increasing entropy changes. Production out of raw material and disposal in a landfill (i.e. "linear economy") results, in most cases, in the largest changes of entropy in the material and is thus the least preferable option.

        <p>Coming back to the washing machine, every stage of the life cycle consumes exergy and produces entropy. For example, including the additional functionality of automatic dosing of detergent requires additional equipment but potentially reduces detergent consumption. The amount of exergy destruction for the alternatives with and without dosing system can be evaluated and the alternative with the lower value selected. Alternatively, the entropy production can be evaluated through either thermodynamic entropy (e.g., in energy dominated systems, like the heating system in a washing machine) or statistical Fig. 3. The dark green slice schematically represents the sustainably available resources for the socio-economic metabolism. This slice may be in reality a little larger (light green slice), but the precautionary principle requires that the sustainable share is determined at the lower end of the uncertainty range. The rest of the resources are necessary for Earth system functioning, which includes the absorption and regeneration of emissions, providing free ecosystem services such as fresh water and air.Coming back to the washing machine, every stage of the life cycle consumes exergy and produces entropy. For example, including the additional functionality of automatic dosing of detergent requires additional equipment but potentially reduces detergent consumption. The amount of exergy destruction for the alternatives with and without dosing system can be evaluated and the alternative with the lower value selected. Alternatively, the entropy production can be evaluated through either thermodynamic entropy (e.g., in energy dominated systems, like the heating system in a washing machine) or statistical Fig. 3.

        <p>Theoretically, materials can be cycled indefinitely as long as sufficient exergy is available (Ayres, 1999). Since available exergy is limited, materials need to be kept at a low level of entropy for as long as possible. However, many different mechanisms, such as dispersion, dilution, contamination, degradation and process losses, inevitably transform materials into a state of high entropy, where it is essentially lost for technical use and thus material cycles cannot be fully closed (see Fig. 4 and Table S1 in SI). For example, material can be dispersed as fine particles in the environment, with no practical means of recovery. Accumulation of impurities is another example for practically limiting factors to recycling (Lovik and Müller, 2014;Nakajima et al., 2009). In general, every process step and exposure to ambient conditions, eventually leads to a loss or degradation of the material. To utilize the materials as long as possible, it is essential to build "clean cycles" (Kral et al., 2013), minimize losses to the environment and design product cycles for longevity (Allwood et al., 2011). The faster a product needs to be replaced, the more often a cycle is needed to provide the same service again and the more material is lost per functional unit. As a second, general requirement for CE, we can thus derive that:Theoretically, materials can be cycled indefinitely as long as sufficient exergy is available (Ayres, 1999).

        <p>The longer a material can be used for its beneficial and intended purpose, the less material per functional unit is lost. Even though material value is preserved, technological progress might make it beneficial to upgrade or replace the product prematurely due to increased energy efficiency in the use phase (Bakker et al., 2014a). This is however only relevant for technologies in early development stages and products causing high impacts in the use phase in comparison with other life-cycle phases and a technological upgrade may solve the problem (Telenko et al., 2016).The longer a material can be used for its beneficial and intended purpose, the less material per functional unit is lost.

        <p>For example, once produced, the washing machine side panel doesn't cause any environmental impacts during its useful life and it is therefore beneficial to use it as long as possible. The washing machine, at the other hand, requires resources and causes environmental impacts during the use phase. The efficiency of the washing machine declines over time due to calcination, wear and material aging and a newer model may have increased efficiency, making it environmentally beneficial to replace the old machine at a certain point (i.e. ecologically optimal lifetime (Gensch and Blepp, 2015)). The side panel, as many other parts of the old washing machine, can be still used in its intended function in the new model, which however would require a standardization of these parts and a take back mechanism for old machines. The longer the use of its parts, the smaller the amount of resources required to fulfil the same functionality.For example, once produced, the washing machine side panel doesn't cause any environmental impacts during its useful life and it is therefore beneficial to use it as long as possible.

Again, such an assessment needs to follow the precautionary principle, that is to say, impacts need to be calculated as the upper limit of the uncertainty range.The strategies of material cycling of mainstream CE understanding, along with strategies from related schools of thought, are derived as a consequence of optimized resource use in a restricted socio-economic system.

        <p>The Circular Economy is a model adopting a resource-based and systemic view, aiming at taking into account all the variables of the system Earth, in order to maintain its viability for human beings. It serves the society to achieve well-being within the physical limits and planetary boundaries. It achieves that through technology and business model innovation, which provide the goods and services required by society, leading to long term economic prosperity. These goods and services are powered by renewable energy and rely on materials which are either renewable through biological processes or can be safely kept in the technosphere, requiring minimum raw material extraction and ensuring safe disposal of inevitable waste and dispersion in the environment. CE builds on and manages the sustainably available resources and optimizes their utilization through minimizing entropy production, slow cycles and resource and energy efficiency.The Circular Economy is a model adopting a resource-based and systemic view, aiming at taking into account all the variables of the system Earth, in order to maintain its viability for human beings.

        <p>Except for the assumed normative position to ensure inter-generational equity and the acknowledged willingness to serve human wellbeing and prosperity (see section 3.2), our abstract and systemic definition of CE intently disregards the content of normative considerations, as they are, per definition, subject to change. From a theoretical perspective, the organization of the society and the contours ofand how we actually definehuman well-being and economic prosperity are the result of normative and political choices that therefore do not have to be further defined in the view of an ideal-typical definition as developed above. Different social organization forms and political systems could certainly be fit to stay within this frame and achieve a non-wasteful use of resources, given that they respect a resource basedapproach. Moreover, different forms of CE can be imagined and could coexist (Hobson and Nicolas, 2016). In an attempt to nevertheless give hints and avenues for reflection and to embed the natural science and engineering considerations developed in section 3.4 into a larger context, we suggest that following general considerations may be discussed, if the goal is to implement a CE concept that is systemic and resource-based by definition. In section 4.1 we raise some important governance questions and show in section 4.2 possible pathways towards an integration of Earth system capacity into resource governance. Section 4.3 discusses the role of business in this approach and will highlight some possible challenges and consequences deriving and whenever useful, applied to the example of a sustainable-circular washing machine.Except for the assumed normative position to ensure inter-generational equity and the acknowledged willingness to serve human wellbeing and prosperity (see section 3.2), our abstract and systemic definition of CE intently disregards the content of normative considerations, as they are, per definition, subject to change.

        <p>4.2. Towards a systematic socio-economic integration of Earth capacity Ehrenfeld (1997), building on intuitionalist models of organized social behaviour, describes "the dominant social paradigm" (DSP) as the paradigmatic foundation in which dominant beliefs and social norms are contained: specific forms of social structures result from the diffusion of "the culturally foundational notions into more explicit organizational (or paradigmatic) forms -government, church, family, corporate, etc.-and the shape of missions, tools, and authoritative relationships that characterize them". The author states that the natural world has been disconnected from social thinking and action in the paradigmatic base of western modernity; therefore implementing our ideal-typical CE within the current DSP represents an (impossible) challenge. Indeed, most of our current institutional structures are being rooted in a "linear" world view and the transition towards a more "systemic" one imply deep changes. Environmental law for example, as credibly shown by DeLucia (2013), historically, is infused with particular epistemological assumptions and cultural values, which reflect a worldview developed "under the influence of the prevailing Cartesian legal ontology". The current position of environmental law internationally is therefore really delicate, as its role is to address multiple ecological crises, while "structurally and conceptually being rooted in a broader legal tradition thoroughly implicated in the domination and 'othering' of nature", hand in hand with science ("the scientific-legal complex") (DeLucia, 2013).4.2.

        <p>With regard to a systemic and resource based CE, it appears that the integration of the natural world and the Earth capacity into socioeconomic thinking requires a shift in the paradigmatic base, as it implies a change in the way all social actors, be it individuals, businesses or governments consume and produce, and more generally, on how they see the world. It may require to question and adapt our worldviews on different subjects (e.g., relationship between humans and nature, patterns of politics, methods of scientific inquiry) (Ehrenfeld, 1997;Wallace et al., 1996). As stated by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (2017), "transitioning to the circular economy will catalyse the most transformational economic, social and environmental changes since the First Industrial Revolution".

        <p>According to a strong compartmentalization logic, environmental considerations are treated as separate and distinct from social and economic considerations. For example, "environmental sustainability" was only one out of 8 MDGs and the environment is considered in only 3 out of 17 SDGs. A similar logic is often present in national regulations, where environmental law is approached as a specific domain instead of being embedded into other regulatory fields. The interests of the environment are weighted as separate parameters to be balanced with other considerations, implicitly occulting the link between the economic and social impacts of the environmental and resource crisis. This reductionist understanding is particularly visible in the weak understanding of sustainable development 8 , which is aiming at balancing environmental, economic and social considerations, while accepting that a decrease of environmental capital can be compensated by the increase of economic or social capital. The original conception of sustainability, as presented in the Brundtland (1987) report, imposed to preserve natural systems and resources in order to maintain the global integrity of the Earth system, is more in line with a systems perspective; there was no possible trade that would allow to compensate irreversible environmental losses through an increase in economic or social capital (Flückiger, 2006). For approaching our ideal-typical definition of CE, the physical limits and environmental boundaries, derived according to the precautionary principle, can be seen as the frame within all activities need to take place. Hence, to reach a socio-economic system that is sustainable in the long runat least from an environmental perspective it should be ensured that the principles of CE, as defined in section 3.5, are respected on a global scale and every socio-economic activity takes place within these boundaries. As a consequence, when it comes to regulating the social organisation (and the economy, which is part of the society), decisions that are not allowing to stay within the safe operating space for humanity (Dearing et al., 2014;Raworth, 2013) should be dismissed. Considerations about the sustainably available resource base are therefore to be integrated into every sector and activity. An example of this understanding is the "wedding cake" representation of the SDG's developed by the Stockholm Resilience Centre, which acknowledges that economies and societies are embedded in the biosphere and that different SDG's directly or indirectly rely on a sound resource base and food system 9 . Also, the idea of integration has already found its way into the policies of the EU: making sure that environmental concerns are fully considered in the decisions and activities of other sectors is a requirement under the EC Treaty since 1997 10 . To put this requirement into practice, the European Council launched the "Cardiff process" in 1998, which was designed to introduce a horizontal approach to environment policy by incorporating it into all Community policies 11 .

        <p>Given the combination between the free market as the primary coordination institution (Ehrenfeld, 1997) and a short time-horizon for decision making and profit earning, environmental regulations are generally perceived as barriers to the exercise of individual and economic freedom 13 . The subsidiary importance of environmental protection acts and its potential opposition with individual and economic freedom can be observed in the international context 14 . Environmental law is sometimes presented as a "mitigating" or "containment" instrument aiming at reducing the ecological problems created by economic and industrial activities "to the extent possible" (DeLucia, 2013). The same phenomenon is to be found at the national level: in Switzerland for example, some dispositions of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) 15 are weakened by typical reservations expressed as "wherever possible" (e.g., art. 30 al. 1 et 2 EPA) or "provided that this is economically acceptable" (e.g., art. 30d al. a EPA, see also art. 11 al. 2 EPA). Swiss case law also explicitly addresses the relationship between environmental protection and economy as a "tension field" (ATF 131 II 431 ss, ground 4.1) 16 . According to art. 36 of the Swiss Constitution (Cst.) 17 restrictions to fundamental rights can be admitted, if the restrictions are necessary and proportionated to guarantee a higher public interest (health, political stability, etc.). In some cases, restrictions to economic freedom (which is a fundamental right, see art. 27 Cst.) were justified by the protection of the environment (ATF 140 I 218 ss, ground 8.8; Supreme Court 2C_ 136/2018, September 24, 2018, ground 6.1). From a systems perspective this makes a lot of sense, a stable environment is a precondition for the economy and society to function. As already identified by the Commission of the European communities in 1998, "the current pattern of economic development too often entails conflicts between development and environment; this cannot be permitted to continue. Policies that result in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources are unlikely to be a sound basis for sustainable economic development" (COM/98/0333) 18 . Regulations, their applicationand therefore mentalitiesneed to adapt in order to overcome this constructed and unsystematic tension field that lies in the way of a transition towards a CE. With a change of perspective, environmental regulations and restrictions could even be perceived as a positive enabler to allow well-being (including economic wealth) and long-term survival (and profit), rather than a barrier to the exercise of their rights and freedom 19 ; hence, instead of thriving to balance supposedly conflicting interests, measures towards a sound resource management would be prioritized in order to ensure other interest (like economic and 8 For the distinction between strong and weak sustainability and different understandings of the notion, see e.g. (Flückiger, 2006;Reiser and Pforr, 2018) 9 See https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2016-06-14-how-food-connects-all-the-sdgs.html, consulted on June 17, 2019. 19 Regarding frameworks aiming to elaborate an ecological philosophy of law, see (Tallacchini, 2000) individual freedom).Given the combination between the free market as the primary coordination institution (Ehrenfeld, 1997) and a short time-horizon for decision making and profit earning, environmental regulations are generally perceived as barriers to the exercise of individual and economic freedom 13 .

        <p>The evolution of environmental law shows that often, major regulations were adopted after main environmental catastrophes, namely to mitigate contaminations, when they became a visible nuisance (see e.g., Knoepfel, 2019). Waste law is being rooted in an end-of-life approach, where the goal is to better manage waste and the contamination of the environment. It is focusing on improving collection and recycling. A lot of progress has been made over the years (from landfill to incineration, better recovery rates and recycling techniques, etc.). However, such an end of pipe approach, focusing on reducing the symptoms and trying to mitigate the negative impacts of production and consumption, rather than examining the global picture, does not cover all aspects of a CE and is therefore insufficient. A conceptual shift towards life-cycle thinking which could be recognized as a formal environmental principle (De Römph, 2018) would be beneficial. It reflects a perception of environmental problems that puts the product at the centre, through its entire life phases and associated impacts (Bugge et al., 2018). Product design and the policy framework impacting design "assume a central role, guiding the flows of materials in and out of the environment, and, at the same time, reflecting their social, economic importance. Looking at products, rather than processes, shifts the policy-maker's focus from the end of the process pipe to the center stage of the market and the market's social importance as a means to satisfy the collective demands of a policy" (Ehrenfeld, 1997). Legislation doesn't expressly addresses or define life-cycle thinking yet, but the EU environmental policies, namely in the light of the CE Package 20 and the Green Paper on Integrated Product Policy 21 consider it as an important "policy principle" (De Römph, 2018). The cascading waste hierarchy, which establishes a priority order from prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling and energy recovery through to final disposal, such as landfilling, is a principle that aims to encourage the options that deliver the best overall environmental outcome (see COM/2015/0614 fin. l cited in footnote 24; in Switzerland, see art. 30 EPA), which is also reflecting a step in direction of life-cycle thinking approach. Going a step further could consist in recognizing the existence of "(EU) materials law" (De Römph, 2018) or to shift from waste to product law (Backes, 2017).The evolution of environmental law shows that often, major regulations were adopted after main environmental catastrophes, namely to mitigate contaminations, when they became a visible nuisance (see e.g., Knoepfel, 2019).

        <p>In relation to the illustrating example of the circular washing-machine, the integration principle could lead to take into account a sound allocation of resource scarcity and budgets in public policies or legislation: that could for example be formalized through importation taxes or directives regarding the choice of materials and product design (e.g., prohibition to use scarce materials if an alternative is available); prioritizing environmental impact rather than free market as a coordination mechanism could for example lead in extended interdictions of toxic substances and materials, changes in accounting rules and standards, taxing "entropy production" rather than "value creation", which should all be designed in a way to make a circular washingmachine more attractive over its life-cycle. Finally, shifting to a lifecycle approach could, for example, be reflected with further implementation of the Extended Producer Responsibility, extension of guarantees, obligations to provide spare parts, higher taxes on primary resources and lower taxes on labour, which are all possible actions that incentivize a better conception of the product with a long-term perspective in mind and an extended usage, through maintenance, repair and refurbishment.In relation to the illustrating example of the circular washing-machine, the integration principle could lead to take into account a sound allocation of resource scarcity and budgets in public policies or legislation: that could for example be formalized through importation taxes or directives regarding the choice of materials and product design (e.g., prohibition to use scarce materials if an alternative is available); prioritizing environmental impact rather than free market as a coordination mechanism could for example lead in extended interdictions of toxic substances and materials, changes in accounting rules and standards, taxing "entropy production" rather than "value creation", which should all be designed in a way to make a circular washingmachine more attractive over its life-cycle.

        <p>Implementing sustainable CE imposes new boundary conditions for the economic system and also requires a paradigm shift in corporate understanding. As argued in section 3.4.1, resources are available in finite quantities. Hence, either there will be regulations that oblige companies to internalize their resource budgets or companies will voluntarily internalize it. In the second case, companies will benefit from the saleable first mover advantage, reduced dependence on resource price fluctuations and positive benefits of social welfare. Either way, this inclusion of resource finiteness would be the starting point for companies to change the current inside-out perspective in the businessas-usual paradigm and shift the perspective to outside-in. Analogous to the considerations of Dyllick and Muff (2016) thoughts to "Truly Sustainable Business", this means that companies need to integrate environmental and social factors into their business management strategies and in their business models. The typological increase (Business Sustainability 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) used by Dyllick and Muff (2016) starts with companies that pay attention to sustainability due to external pressure or market factors without changing the current business premises up to companies that convert sustainability challenges into business opportunities and give business sense to social or environmental issues. The voluntary inclusion of such resource budgets as a self-restricting instrument raises companies in this typology high upwards.Implementing sustainable CE imposes new boundary conditions for the economic system and also requires a paradigm shift in corporate understanding.

        <p>The pragmatic application of this outside-in approach can be found in the innovation from traditional to more sustainable (e.g., Baden-Fuller (1995); Joyce and Paquin (2016); Lüdeke-Freund et al. ( 2018)) or in our case cycle-oriented business models (e.g., Bocken et al. (2014)). The change of perspective through the outside-in approach can also lead to more integral and sustainable management practice as called for, e.g., by Stead and Stead (2008). Especially the voluntary restriction to sustainable resource budgets and optimizing its use through company management may stimulate activity in the market economy as well as in social and political structures and provide important impulses for the introduction of state-coordinated regulations towards sustainable resource allocations. The paradigm shift lies in the fact that the inclusion of a finite availability of resources becomes a key factor in strategic decisions and thus actively flows into the corporate calculation.The pragmatic application of this outside-in approach can be found in the innovation from traditional to more sustainable (e.g., Baden-Fuller (1995); Joyce and Paquin (2016); Lüdeke-Freund et al.

        <p>The paradigm shift can also be seen in a further pragmatic step as the effort of companies to innovate their business models as a result of the (exogenous) resource budget constraints. This is due to the fact that innovative business models (e.g., "light as a service" (Philips Lighting, 2018)) can drastically reduce the resource requirement and thus can be of significant competitive advantage. And business models determine the profound purpose and activities of a company as well as the logic of how value is delivered to the consumer as a holistic description (Chesbrough, 2010;Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002;Teece, 2010;Zott and Amit, 2010). The growing business model literature deals with the in-depth redesign of business models and demands an easier integration of sustainability into the business of companies (Bocken et al., 2014;Boons et al., 2013;Joyce and Paquin, 2016;Schaltegger and Wagner, 2011;Stubbs and Cocklin, 2008;Yunus et al., 2010). In this context, various authors speak of "circular business models" (Bakker et al., 2014b;Geissdoerfer et al., 2018;Urbinati et al., 2017). It is important to note that the idea of "one" business model on its own can achieve CE seems rather illusoryin view of all the business activities that have to be undertaken to create a CE. The "circular" says more about the "cycle applicability" than about a self-contained circular business model. It is therefore helpful to place the innovation of "circular" business models in the larger context and to see it as a bundle of business models along the closed-loop supply chain which enable a CE (Guide andVan Wassenhove, 2006, 2009;Lüdeke-Freund et al., 2019).

        <p>The practical example of the washing machine from section 3 with the changes in design, selection of materials and the adapted possibilities of usage show how challenging the design of new, cycle-oriented business models can be. A critical and complicating issue, which is typical for the linear economy, is the fact that products are classically sold to the consumers. The resulting loss of customer relationship and control over the product itself while it is useddue to the change in ownershipmakes lifetime-extending repairs, maintenance or concrete refurbishment measures difficult (Bocken et al., 2016;Moreno et al., 2016;Ritala et al., 2018). In order to increase the profitability of such circular changes, incentives can be internalized via new revenue models, which no longer require a change of ownership and expand the corporate customer relationship (Bocken et al., 2014;Moreno et al., 2016). For practical illustration, two suitable revenue modelsas an important part of a cycle-oriented business modelare presented in more detail: performance-based contracting or pay-per-use (Bocken et al., 2016;Ellen MacArthur, 2013;Gassmann et al., 2014). The first one enables companies to deliver a comprehensive service promise (which includes maintenance, upgrading, etc.) to their customers which aims to provide a desired outcome (e.g., clean garments) instead of the purchase of the washing machine. Due to the new contractual situation, the company generates income during the entire lifetime of the washing machine, and no longer only by selling it once. Also with the second revenue model the washing machine remains in the ownership of the manufacturer and the customer pays simply per wash, i.e. pay-perwash. In addition, this increases the incentive for consumers to limit their consumption to what is necessary and to price it more precisely. Studies in the corporate context show that the implementation of cycleoriented business models or patterns is complex and subject to a wide variety of interlinked dimensions of politics, market, society and technology (de Jesus and Mendonça, 2018; Kirchherr et al., 2017;Ormazabal et al., 2017). All these studies show barriers towards the implementation of CE and demonstrate at the same time the key role of companies in the centre of all these interconnections and interdependencies as effective implementing bodies of CE. The analysis of the barriers identified (often divided into cultural, technical, market and regulatory barriers) indirectly reveal the enormous inherent potential that can be found in solutions to overcome them. Kirchherr et al. (2017) show how the different barriers are connected and that the interrelatedness of these can lead to chain reactions towards the implementation failure or success of CE. In this way, market-relevant factors can prevent political and thus legal changes, which in turn prevent market efforts towards new and innovative cycle-oriented business model innovations and in the end hinder change in consumer behaviour. For example, a lack of demand for resource-saving and cycle-oriented products can lead to a restrained supply of such products on the market and limited funding related business models, which in turn reduces the signal for politicians to elaborate incentive systems for companies who want to produce cycle-oriented products. The described interdependence does not only move in one direction but can also be seen as one with reciprocal potential. This is a clear statement for the voluntary participation of companies in the integration of the above-mentioned resource budgets and thus taking up the role as exemplary signal carriers in the market. Companies can therefore not only benefit from the predicted financial long-term potential of CE and innovative cycle-oriented business models (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015;World Business Counsil for Sustainable Development and Boston Consulting Group, 2018), but also redefine its corporate sense of purpose. They can directly or indirectly as a by-product of their traditional corporate activities play this important role in the transition towards CE. The corporate opportunities resulting from new cycle-oriented business models can thus be transferred on the one hand to secure corporate prosperity and longterm survival and on the other hand, trigger important impulses beyond the actual corporate sphere of activity. In order to bring CE forward, there is a need to critically evaluate the risk that either companies or governments use CE as pure symbolic signalling effect (Baker, 2007;Matten, 2003). Otherwise, CE as a concept becomes meaningless and degenerates into a simple marketing medium.The practical example of the washing machine from section 3 with the changes in design, selection of materials and the adapted possibilities of usage show how challenging the design of new, cycle-oriented business models can be.

        <p>This paper presents a systematic top-down approach to CE, which describes an ideal, or reference, and aims at connecting global sustainability criteria with initiatives at company level. The normative assumption behind this ideal is based on the global consensus that humanity thrives for well-being and survival for present and further generations. In order to connect environmental boundary conditions with individual decision making, we identified a need to translate ecosystem boundaries into resource budgets. These serve two purposes: the comparison of material alternatives to aid the selection of materials based on easy-to-handle environmental criteria, as well as the quantification of the absolute resource intensity reduction required to reach environmental sustainability on a global scale. A CE strives to utilize these limited resource most effectively and we have identified three general engineering guidelines to achieve this:This paper presents a systematic top-down approach to CE, which describes an ideal, or reference, and aims at connecting global sustainability criteria with initiatives at company level.

        <p>-Minimize entropy production: selecting circular strategies (e.g., reuse, refurbishment) according to the entropy production over the whole life-cycle. -Slow cycles: prolonging the service life of parts (e.g., to be used in refurbished products) or the whole product (e.g., reuse). -Resource efficiency: reducing process losses (e.g., off-cuts) and material demand for functional equivalence (e.g. light-weighting).-Minimize entropy production: selecting circular strategies (e.g., reuse, refurbishment) according to the entropy production over the whole life-cycle. -Slow cycles: prolonging the service life of parts (e.g., to be used in refurbished products) or the whole product (e.g., reuse). -Resource efficiency: reducing process losses (e.g., off-cuts) and material demand for functional equivalence (e.g. light-weighting).</p>
        <p>The implementation of a CE could be eased by the adoption of punctual new regulations and incentives, such as for example interdiction of mixed-materials, higher tax on raw material and lower tax on labor, etc. More importantly, transitioning towards a sustainable CE is tightly linked with a shift in the way we look at the world, which in turn impacts how we conceive, systematize and apply our regulatory and institutional systems. Namely, from a policy perspective, we suggest that a CE could benefit from and lead towards higher integration of environmental concerns into every other field, a clear prioritization of maintaining a sustainable resource-base over other short-term interests in order to safeguard these interests in the long-runand finally a lifecycle-thinking approach. At the company level, this raises the question of how business models can be innovated along closed-loop supply chains in such a way that they can jointly satisfy customer needs within the resource budgets. This involves the shaping of customer relationships, entrepreneurial cooperation in value networks along the closedloop supply chain and the shaping of suitable revenue models as well as product take-back procedures.The implementation of a CE could be eased by the adoption of punctual new regulations and incentives, such as for example interdiction of mixed-materials, higher tax on raw material and lower tax on labor, etc. More importantly, transitioning towards a sustainable CE is tightly linked with a shift in the way we look at the world, which in turn impacts how we conceive, systematize and apply our regulatory and institutional systems.

        <p>To support business model and technical innovations, guidelines and indicators need to be developed to enable and ensure an effective implementation of CE. These guidelines can influence the design of a product system starting with the conception phase, when the environmental impacts are essentially determined. Before a product enters the market, a life cycle assessment (LCA) (Pennington et al., 2004;Rebitzer et al., 2004) study can show how effective the design process had implemented the sustainability requirements of CE. Further, material flow analysis (MFA) (Brunner and Rechberger, 2016) on sector, country and global scales need to keep track of the material flows and monitor the actual utilization of the sustainable resource base and its associated environmental impacts of socio-economic activities. The business motive will drive innovation to utilize the restricted resources best. This will, we believe, trigger research and development of truly "circular" products, following the general guidelines outlined in this paper.To support business model and technical innovations, guidelines and indicators need to be developed to enable and ensure an effective implementation of CE.

        <p>As a next step, there is a need to develop possible pathways to initiate a transition process towards such a CE. It is necessary to develop a methodology to estimate and calculate global sustainable resource budgets. Based on this, concrete product design guidelines can be formulated and tested in case studies together with companies. Business model innovation goes hand in hand with the product design, in order to achieve the resource intensity reductions in the product or service required to reach environmental sustainability globally. From an implementation perspective, the allocation of resource budgets requires the creation of new institutional structures or a political agreement within the current ones; however, voluntary bottom-up initiatives from companies, sectors, countries, can lead to self-orientation towards the respect of planetary boundaries.As a next step, there is a need to develop possible pathways to initiate a transition process towards such a CE.
