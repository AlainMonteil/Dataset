        <p>Microplastics (MPs) are an environmental growing concern, with an annual input to the environment of 11 million tons (Boucher and Friot, 2017). Agriculture fields receiving sludge from sewage treatment plants as fertilizers constitute one of the largest inputs of MPs to the environment (63000-430000 t of MPs per year; (Nizzetto et al., 2016). Only in Europe, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) produce 13 million tons of dry weight sludge per year and approximately 99% of MPs can be retained in the sludge (Magnusson and Norén, 2014). 80% of this sludge is used in agriculture (Mahon et al., 2017). Despite the importance of quantifying the concentrations of MPs in sludge (de Souza et al., 2018;Corradini et al., 2019), to date, there is no standardized protocol for their extraction and quantification (Rocha-Santos and Duarte, 2015;Rochman et al., 2017).Microplastics (MPs) are an environmental growing concern, with an annual input to the environment of 11 million tons (Boucher and Friot, 2017).

        <p>Different methodologies have been proposed for the extraction of MPs from sludge samples, generally using oxidizing agents and acids to remove part of the organic matter and a density separation of the MPs by means of saline solutions (Lusher et al., 2017;Sujathan et al., 2017;Hurley et al., 2018;Lares et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018). However, one of the drawbacks of using high concentrations of these agents to remove organic matter is the possible degradation of some polymers, (Avio et al., 2015), difficulting their identification by using Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy (Lares et al., 2018).Different methodologies have been proposed for the extraction of MPs from sludge samples, generally using oxidizing agents and acids to remove part of the organic matter and a density separation of the MPs by means of saline solutions (Lusher et al., 2017;Sujathan et al., 2017;Hurley et al., 2018;Lares et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018).

        <p>Additionally, estimates of MPs concentrations must be accompanied by a recovery test of the most abundant types of MPs comprising different sizes. Previous studies quantifying MPs in sludge or in soil samples have generally performed partial recovery tests only using one (Mahon et al., 2017;Sujathan et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018) or two shapes of MPs (Hurley et al., 2018;Corradini et al., 2019) and in some cases a recovery test was not applied (Lusher et al., 2017;van den Berg et al., 2020). Nevertheless, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f recovery tests are key in assessing the effectiveness of the extraction methods, necessary to design standardized procedures that can precisely estimate MPs concentrations in sewage sludge.Additionally, estimates of MPs concentrations must be accompanied by a recovery test of the most abundant types of MPs comprising different sizes.

        <p>MPs are expected to alter the biophysical properties of the soil, in terms of water retention capacity, bulk density, microbial activity and formation of aggregates, which could lead to an alteration in the water cycle in the soil (de Souza Machado et al., 2018;Wan et al., 2019). However, the effect that MPs accumulation in the soil will generate on the vegetation has been scarcely studied. MPs present in sludge from WWTPs used in agriculture can remain in soil for a long-time affecting the vegetative growth (van den Berg et al., 2020). In this sense, it has been reported that MPs can induce changes in both aerial and below-ground parts during vegetative growth in the wheat plant (Qi et al., 2018) while reducing the germination rate and root growth of Lepidium sativum as the concentration of MPs to which plants were exposed increased (Bosker et al., 2019).MPs are expected to alter the biophysical properties of the soil, in terms of water retention capacity, bulk density, microbial activity and formation of aggregates, which could lead to an alteration in the water cycle in the soil (de Souza Machado et al., 2018;Wan et al., 2019).

        <p>Although sewage sludge has been employed to improve soil fertility in agriculture (Llorens et al., 2012), to the best of our knowledge, changes induced by sludge containing MPs in vegetative growth and fruit maturation of cultivated plants have not been studied.Although sewage sludge has been employed to improve soil fertility in agriculture (Llorens et al., 2012), to the best of our knowledge, changes induced by sludge containing MPs in vegetative growth and fruit maturation of cultivated plants have not been studied.</p>
        <p>The aim of this work is to assess the efficiency of a protocol for MPs extraction and quantification from sewage sludge samples and evaluate the effect of sewage sludge containing MPs on tomato plants once applied in soil. To assess the efficiency of the extraction and quantification protocol, a recovery test was carried out using different types of particles, materials and sizes. At last, the effects of sewage sludge containing MPs on tomato plants were evaluated by means of response variables related to growth and fruit production.The aim of this work is to assess the efficiency of a protocol for MPs extraction and quantification from sewage sludge samples and evaluate the effect of sewage sludge containing MPs on tomato plants once applied in soil.

        <p>Three replicates of 20 mL sludge from each WWTP were introduced in 250 mL prewashed glass beakers.

        <p>Then, MPs were extracted through density separation by adding 150 mL of a NaCl saturated solution and stirring with a glass rod for 3 minutes. The solution was then allowed to settle overnight. Afterwards, the supernatant was decanted and filtered. By adding 150 mL of the saline solution, MPs decantation was facilitated by minimizing resuspension of the settled particles. This process was repeated four times. Since the density of the used saline solution was 1.2 g cm -3 , some polymers, mainly polyethylene terephthalate (PET; (density 1.29 -1.40 g cm -3 ) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC; density 1.30 -1.58 g cm -3 ) (Duxbury, 1992) may not float in the solution but settle on the bottom of the beaker. To prevent this, in the last repetition of the process, 6 g of sodium bicarbonate were added to the saline solution. Then, the solution was heated for approximately 4 minutes until the temperature reached between 45ºC and 50ºC and stirred with a glass rod to facilitate the release of CO 2 bubbles that promote the flotation of MPs to the top of the saline solution (per. obs.). The supernatant was filtered through glass fiber filters with a pore size of 1.2 µm (Frisenette ApS, Knebel, Denmark).Then, MPs were extracted through density separation by adding 150 mL of a NaCl saturated solution and stirring with a glass rod for 3 minutes.

        <p>Filters were left in petri dishes and the remaining organic matter was removed by submerging them with approximately 20 mL of 1:1 (v/v) H 2 O 2 (30 wt. %) + H 2 SO 4 (96 wt. %) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) solution and left overnight. Since the H 2 O 2 :H 2 SO 4 solution produces a very exothermic reaction, it was left to cool down before being used to prevent possible damage to MPs. The used solution was chosen after several tests using the following proportions of H 2 O 2 (30 wt. %) and H 2 SO 4 (96 wt. %): 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 aiming to find the best compromise between organic matter removal and avoidance of PET microfibers disintegration, which are the most sensitive component to be disintegrated out of the main plastic debris found in the sludge (per. obs.). The best results were obtained by using the 1:1 ratio in which fibers were not visually affected.Filters were left in petri dishes and the remaining organic matter was removed by submerging them with approximately 20 mL of 1:1 (v/v) H 2 O 2 (30 wt. %) + H 2 SO 4 (96 wt. %) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) solution and left overnight.

        <p>After the exposition of filters to the acid solution, the liquid content in the petri dishes was filtered. Both petri dishes and filters were rinsed off several times with distilled water to ensure that no particles were retained. Then, particles in the filters were identified by Raman spectroscopy and quantified. Since some particles were retained on the walls of the bottom part of the funnel of the filtering equipment, after each filtration, the funnel was separated from the main structure, washed with distilled water and the liquid collected was filtered again in the same filtration unit to avoid MPs losses.After the exposition of filters to the acid solution, the liquid content in the petri dishes was filtered.

        <p>A recovery test was performed to estimate the extraction efficiency and reproducibility of the protocol used in this study. The recovery test was carried out using commercially available plastic materials with different shapes and sizes (Table S2) representative of the MPs found in sludge. The MPs were spiked into 20 mL of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f sludge from W3. The particles used in the recovery test had specific colors and shapes to facilitate their differentiation from particles already present in the sludge. In addition, it was previously checked that the treatments applied to remove the organic matter did not alter the particles used in the recovery test.A recovery test was performed to estimate the extraction efficiency and reproducibility of the protocol used in this study.

        <p>Fragments were composed of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) from a bleach bottle and a cap of a container, respectively. For films, HDPE and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were used, from different plastic bags. The sizes of fragments and films were: 0.4-0.6 mm, 0.8-1.0 mm, 1.9-2.1 mm and 2.4-2.6 mm. PET microfibers were obtained from two T-shirts with a length of ca. 2 mm. Microbeads were composed of butylene/ethylene copolymer (B/E) and they were obtained from a shower gel presenting a size between 0.6 and 0.8 mm. Fragments, films and microfibers were cut using a binocular magnifying glass (LFZ Dual, OPTECH, Ontario, Canada), a graduated scale and a scalpel to produce the desired sizes. To test the repeatability, a total of 10 particles of each size and type of material were added to 20 mL of sludge, summing a total of 80 fragments, 80 films, 20 PET microfibers and 10 B/E microbeads.Fragments were composed of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) from a bleach bottle and a cap of a container, respectively.

        <p>The tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) was chosen since it is widely cultivated and shows low or no toxicity due to over fertilization with macronutrients (Sainju et al., 2003). One-month tomato plants were transplanted outdoors on the 14 th of March of 2019 individually into a 3.3 L pot made of terracotta. The dimension of each pot was 19 cm high, diameter of 20.7 cm at the top and 12.7 cm at the bottom. Five soils, control (C), manure control (MC), and soils containing sludge of each WWTP (W1, W2 and W3), were created using 50:50:0:0, 45:45:10:0, and 45:45:0:10 proportions of peat moss (COMPO SANA ® UNIVERSAL, Münster, Germany), silica sand (grain size range: 0.4-0.8 mm), manure (FEMABÓN ®, Castellón, Spain) and sludge, respectively.The tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) was chosen since it is widely cultivated and shows low or no toxicity due to over fertilization with macronutrients (Sainju et al., 2003).

        <p>Control soil was used as the reference substrate, while manure control soil was used as a fertilizer-type amendment to soil aimed to simulate nutrient addition to the soil but with an insignificant MPs concentration. To ensure that there was no nutrient deficiency due to the different element composition of manure and sewage sludge in all soils, each plant was fertilized monthly with 10 g of a solid slow-release fertilizer (Bluefficient Platinnum®, Salamanca, Spain), aiming to prevent changes in the development of tomatoes due to a specific element deficiency while avoiding fertilizer toxicity. Characteristics of the employed peat, manure, and fertilizer used are shown in Table S4. Each type of soil was replicated in seven pots, each one containing a tomato plant, so seven tomato plants were cultivated in each type of soil which made a total of 35 tomato plants.Control soil was used as the reference substrate, while manure control soil was used as a fertilizer-type amendment to soil aimed to simulate nutrient addition to the soil but with an insignificant MPs concentration.

        <p>The experiment consisted of a one factor (type of soil) design with five types of soils: C, MC, W1, W2 and W3. Each treatment was replicated three times. Significant differences among the response variables measured in the different types of soils were analyzed through a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Before ANOVA, the normality was tested through Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test and heterogeneity of variance of the data was tested using Cochran's test. If the data did not meet these assumptions, transformations were applied, and assumptions were checked again. When significant differences were found in the ANOVA main test, the post-hoc Tukey's test was used to find which treatments significantly differed (Table S5). Statistical analyses were performed with the

In addition, the recovery test carried out in this study is comprehensively complete compared to previous ones where only a few types of particles, materials and sizes were used (Mahon et al., 2017;Sujathan et al., 2017;Hurley et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018;). Specifically, in this work the recovery test uses microfibers, which is generally the main component of sludge despite not being a particle type commonly used in recovery tests (Mahon et al., 2017;Sujathan et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018). Our results indicate that this extraction method is capable J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of efficiently recover PP, LDPE, HDPE and PET microfibers, which are the most commonly used plastics (PlasticsEurope, 2019) and the most common types of MPs found in sludge (Mahon et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018;Corradini et al., 2019). Thus, this study demonstrates that the present extraction method is suitable for the extraction of MPs in sewage sludge, while being inexpensive and safer than others that use other salts, such as ZnCl and NaI.The obtained percentage values of extraction efficiency are, in general, comparable with previous studies (Mahon et al., 2017;Sujathan et al., 2017;Hurley et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018;Corradini et al., 2019).

Additionally, because of its shape, fragments and films, for a specific size, are more likely to be retained than microfibers in the pretreatment filters of WWTPs before entering in the degreaser-desander channel.

        <p>The mean values of pH obtained for W1 (6.4±0.1) and W3 (6.5±0.1) were considered slightly acidic, whereas W2 (6.6 ± 0.4), MC (7.2±0.1) and C (6.8±0.1) were considered neutral (Juárez et al., 2004), which limits nutrient deficiency problems of nutrient availability related to highly acidic or basic soils (Sainju et al. 2003). The mean values of electrical conductivity obtained from C (3.3 ± 0.2 dS/m), W1 (2.9 ± 0.2 dS/m), W2 (2.8 ± 0.1 dS/m) and W3 (2.7 ± 0.1 dS/m) were considered very slightly saline (2-4 dS/m) whereas MC soil was considered slightly saline (5.3 ± 0.2 dS/m) (Schoeneberger et al., 2002). The sludge addition to soils generally results in an increase of their salinity, but in case of saline soils, it can reduce their salinity (Pomares et al. 1998). Peat moss, that was used as the base of the soil component in the present experiment, can retain a large amount of cations, which could be responsible of increasing the levels of salinity. The variety of tomato plants used, Raf, have a threshold of tolerance to salinity of 6 dS/m (Nelson, 2011). Thus, the levels of salinity in the different types of soil is not expected to negatively affect the growth and yield of tomato plants.The mean values of pH obtained for W1 (6.4±0.1) and W3 (6.5±0.1) were considered slightly acidic, whereas W2 (6.6 ± 0.4), MC (7.2±0.1) and C (6.8±0.1) were considered neutral (Juárez et al., 2004), which limits nutrient deficiency problems of nutrient availability related to highly acidic or basic soils (Sainju et al. 2003).

        <p>Our results suggest contrasting effects of sludge addition in soils since the biomass production was higher in plants cultured with sludge than the ones cultured in the C or MC soils. However, tomato plants cultured in soils treated with sludge from W3, which had the highest concentration of MPs, had the lowest biomass and tomato production, while it did not produce any mature tomato during the experiment. Plant biomass can be influenced by many factors, such as soil humidity, soil and air temperature, photoperiod, solar radiation, precipitations, genotype, etc. One of the most important factors influencing biomass is soil nutrient availability since both nutrient deficiency and toxicity negatively affect total biomass and fruit production (Msilini et al., 2009;Karim et al., 2012). The solid slow-release fertilizer aimed to prevent nutrient limitation. The shoot:root biomass ratio of cultured plants did not show significant differences among plants cultured in the different soils, suggesting non-relevant differences in nutrient availability among soils (Ericsson, 1995).

        <p>Our results indicate a lower crop in the tomato plants grown under soil treated with sludge at the time of the end of the experiment. This could be because of microfibers in increasing C:N ratio as a consequence of the modification of nutrient availability derived from alterations in water dynamics reported in onion plants ( de Souza Machado et al., 2019). Nutrient alterations can lead to plant stress, lowering crop production (Li et al., 2009). Since the experiment did not last until the end of the crop season, we could not know if the tomato plants suffered a reduction in crop or only a delay in crop production. Nevertheless, a delay in the crop production is expected to lower the overall crop production that is possible to be harvested (Thomison et al., 2011).Our results indicate a lower crop in the tomato plants grown under soil treated with sludge at the time of the end of the experiment.

        <p>To determine pH values, air-dried soil samples from the pots were sieved through a 2 mm mesh to keep all primary soil particles and remove roots and bigger soil aggregates. Then, 40 mL of sieved soil was added to a glass beaker and slowly wetted with distilled water (sensu Juárez et al., 2004). After that, soil was stirred for 20 seconds with a glass rod and left 60 minutes before the pH was measured (pH Basic 20, Crison Instruments S.A., Barcelona, Spain). To monitor soil salinity, a container was placed under each tomato plant to collect 50 mL of the water lixiviated after watering the plants. Then, the electrical conductivity of the collected water samples was measured by using an electrical conductivity meter (Crison Basic 30, Barcelona, Spain).To determine pH values, air-dried soil samples from the pots were sieved through a 2 mm mesh to keep all primary soil particles and remove roots and bigger soil aggregates.
