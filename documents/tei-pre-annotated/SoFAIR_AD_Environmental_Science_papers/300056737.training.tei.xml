        <p>Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have enabled a historic increase in the conversion of electric energy to photons, but this is approaching a physical limit. The theoretical maximum efficiency occurs when all input energy is converted to energy in photosynthetic photons. Blue LEDs can be 93% efficient, phosphor-converted "whites" 76% efficient, and red LEDs 81% efficient. These improvements open new opportunities for horticultural lighting. Here we review (1) fundamental physics and efficiency of LEDs, (2) the current efficacy of LEDs, (3) the effect of spectral quality on crop yield, and (4) the potential efficacy of horticultural fixtures. Advances in the conversion of photons to yield can be achieved by optimization of spectral effects on plant morphology, which vary among species. Conversely, spectral effects on photosynthesis are remarkably similar across species, but the conventional definition of photosynthetic photons (400-700 nm) may need to be modified. The upper limit of LED fixture efficacy is determined by the LED package efficacy multiplied by four factors inherent to all fixtures: current droop, thermal droop, driver (power supply) inefficiencies, and optical losses. With current LED technology, the calculations indicate efficacy limits of 3.4 µmol J -1 for white + red fixtures, and 4.1 µmol J -1 for blue + red fixtures. Adding optical protection from water and high humidity reduces these values by ~10%. We describe tradeoffs between peak efficacy and cost.Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have enabled a historic increase in the conversion of electric energy to photons, but this is approaching a physical limit.

        <p>The term efficiency applies to ratios with the same units in the numerator and denominator, which can be expressed as a percentage. LED efficiency describes the optical power output divided by the electrical power input (watt/watt or %). The term efficacy applies to ratios with different units. In horticultural lighting, efficacy refers to micromoles of photon output per second, per watt of input power. Since a watt is a joule per second, this simplifies to µmol per joule. The relationship between photon energy and wavelength is expressed in the Planck-Einstein relation, often just called Planck's equation. This equation states that energy is inversely proportional to wavelength (E ¼ hc λ ). This equation is used to convert between efficiency and efficacy, and it is used to calculate the maximum possible photosynthetic photon efficacy for a given spectrum.The term efficiency applies to ratios with the same units in the numerator and denominator, which can be expressed as a percentage.

        <p>By converting LED efficiency into efficacy, we get the appropriate units for determining the impact of photons on plants per input electrical power. This follows another physical law called the Stark-Einstein Law, which states that for every photon absorbed, only one molecule can react. This Law can be restated to say that one photon excites one electron. In this paper, photon efficacy is limited to photons between 400 and 700 nm, except in the case of far-red LEDs, where photons from up to 800 nm are included. LED package manufacturers often report efficacy in lumens per watt, because this is a meaningful metric for human lighting, but it is not applicable for horticultural lighting because it is a measure of photons weighted for human vision based on the human eye response to different colors.By converting LED efficiency into efficacy, we get the appropriate units for determining the impact of photons on plants per input electrical power.

        <p>1. Electrical efficiency: the ratio of the emitted photon energy expressed in electron volts to the applied voltage (V photon /V f ), affected by internal electrical resistance of the LED. 2. The internal quantum efficiency (photon per electron): the conversion of electrons to photons, affected by non-radiative recombination pathways, including impurities and microphysical defects. 3. Photon extraction efficiency: the ratio of photons that exit the LED semiconductor material to total generated photons, affected by internal reflection and reabsorption. Losses in extracting photons out of an LED package are termed "package losses" within the LED industry. These can vary greatly among LED package types. White LEDs will also incur phosphor conversion losses which will be discussed later in the paper. For a more comprehensive description of LED efficiency, see ref. 1 . Incremental improvements have been made to each of the three factors above resulting in a substantial improvement of LED packages over the past 10 years. Now, far-red, red, white, and blue LEDs, respectively, can be 77, 81, 76, and 93% efficient (Table 1).1.

        <p>White LEDs consist of blue LEDs with a luminescent material coating (e.g., a phosphor material, typically Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce) that absorbs blue photons and luminesces at longer wavelengths. Phosphor-converted white LEDs are designed to transmit some blue photons, with the remainder converted to longer wavelengths. Types and amounts of phosphor are varied to create multiple hues and color qualities. Figure 1 shows a general relationship between correlated color temperature (CCT) and percentage of blue photons (400-500 nm). This relationship generally follows Wien's Displacement Law, which indicates that as the CCT increases the peak wavelength decreases. Therefore, white LEDs with a high CCT have a higher percentage of blue photons. In addition to CCT, electric lights are qualified/quantified by other metrics, including CRI and TM-30 (see ref. 2 ). Both CRI and the TM-30 metric of R f use a scale of 0-100 to describe color fidelity. A high color fidelity facilitates observing subtle color differences. This is important to human observers for visual identification of tiny insects, nutritional disorders, and diseases. Suitable color fidelity is also necessary for machine vision.White LEDs consist of blue LEDs with a luminescent material coating (e.g., a phosphor material, typically Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce) that absorbs blue photons and luminesces at longer wavelengths.

        <p>Commonly used terms to associate names with color temperatures are warm white (2500-3500 K), neutral white (3500-4500 K), cool white (4500-5500 K), and daylight (5500-7500 K).

        <p>Increased density of phosphor coatings and increased use of red phosphor materials decreases efficiency. A 6500 K LED (daylight) with about 30% blue photons can have 95% of the photon output of its non-phosphorconverted blue LED counterpart, but this value decreases to 80-85% for a warm white LED with 10% blue photons. In addition, as the optical output of white LEDs increases, the phosphor efficiency will decrease. This is due to conversion, energy, and optical losses within the phosphor conversion process. Data derived from company websites (see below). The conversion of efficiency to photon efficacy depends on spectral distribution Fig. 1 The general relationship between color temperature on percent blue photons (left axis), and the effect of color temperature on photon efficacy (right axis). Exact values vary among manufacturers. Photon efficacy in this graph is presented at a junction temperature of 25°C and 150mA.

        <p>LEDs are designed for performance at specific current ranges. Moderate LED drive current density enables higher efficiency, but at very low drive currents, efficiency decreases. LED loss mechanisms are typically a function of current density. So at a given current, increasing the size of an LED chip can increase the efficacy of an LED by reducing the current density. Unfortunately, chip area is often confidential, and LED manufacturers only report LED specifications at the total LED drive current, not drive current density.LEDs are designed for performance at specific current ranges.

        <p>Figures 2 and3 are calculated using the data from Lumileds (Amsterdam, Netherlands) (Wouter Soer, personal communication) 4 , Osram (Munich, Germany) [5][6][7] , and Samsung (Seoul, South Korea) 8 . These companies provide LED efficacy data in µmol J -1 . Additional LED manufacturers include Nichia (Anan, Japan) 9 , Cree (Durham, North Carolina, USA) 10 , Epistar (Hsinchu, Taiwan) 11 , and many others. As technology improves, see the companies' websites to find the latest LED package efficacy information, and apply the principles described below to determine potential fixture efficacy. Figure 2 shows the decrease in efficacy as a function of drive current density for typical LEDs. This effect is referred to as current "droop". Current droop is the decrease in radiative efficiency of the LED as current is increased. For a blue LED current, droop is caused by Auger recombination 12,13 . For a white LED, which has a blue LED and a phosphor conversion layer, the droop is caused by Auger in the blue LED and reduction in phosphor conversion efficiency at higher optical flux concentrations 14 . For red and far-red LEDs, the current droop is caused by carrier leakage due to poor confinement of electrons in the active regions 15 . In general, decreasing the drive current increases the efficacy, but eventually Shockley-Read-Hall defect losses will dominate at very low drive current 16 . LED manufacturers continue to both increase LED peak efficiency and reduce current droop. The theoretical maximum lines for red (centered at 660 nm) and blue (centered at 450 nm) LEDs are based on the assumption of 100% power efficiency of the LED or hypothetical photon generating device (1 W electricity input = 1 W photon output) followed by a conversion to number of photons using Planck's equation. White LEDs would be as efficient as blue LEDs if phosphor conversion was 100% efficient. However, phosphor conversion efficiencies range from 80 to 95%, depending on amount of phosphor, phosphor material, temperature, and photon flux density. A color-mixed "white" fixture using direct-emitting (not phosphor converted) green LEDs (550 nm) as well as red and blue LEDs would have a theoretical maximum of ~4.6 µmol J -1 , but direct-emitting green LEDs currently have low efficiency (referred to as the green gap 17 ) resulting in low efficacy (about 1.9 µmol J -1 ) 18 .Figures 2 and3 are calculated using the data from Lumileds (Amsterdam, Netherlands) (Wouter Soer, personal communication) 4 , Osram (Munich, Germany) [5][6][7] , and Samsung (Seoul, South Korea) 8 .

        <p>The first commercial horticultural LED fixtures were blue + red combinations. These fixtures, which produced a spectrum that appeared magenta, had a higher efficacy than white or white + red fixtures. Many people thought that these blue + red fixtures would enhance photosynthesis compared with full spectrum fixtures due to their close match to the chlorophyll absorption spectrum, which shows peak absorption in the blue and red regions of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) spectrum. This thinking was advanced by early LED manufacturers, even though green photons have long been known to be effective for photosynthesis 26,27 . Due to widespread use in lighting applications for human vision, white LED packages are now ~20% of the cost of red LEDs. This has contributed to the increase in the fraction of white LEDs to more than 60% in some horticultural fixtures.The first commercial horticultural LED fixtures were blue + red combinations.

Because of absorption by inactive pigments (e.g., anthocyanin), blue photons are ~20% less photosynthetically efficient than photons from the most common red LED (660 nm) 26,27 . However, the blue-induced decreases in leaf area (reducing photon capture) may have a larger effect on overall plant growth than the blue-induced reduction in photosynthetic rate 28 . A range of 5-30% blue is typically used in horticultural LED fixtures to inhibit excessive stem extension and reduce plant height, which is typically beneficial for controlled environment growth.Blue photons (400-500 nm) reduce plant height and leaf expansion in nearly all species 28,[33][34][35] .

        <p>Green photons (500-600 nm) improve human perception of color. Unfortunately, monochromatic direct emitting (non-phosphor converted) green LEDs have low efficacy.

        <p>Red photons (600-700 nm) are well absorbed by leaves, are photosynthetically efficient, and are efficiently generated by LEDs so they are widely used in horticultural fixtures. The classical paradigm has been that red and farred act antagonistically to inhibit or induce shade avoidance symptoms, such as stem elongation, hyponastic leaf orientation, and/or reduced branching 46,47 . However, the high absorbance of red photons by chlorophyll means that the impact of red on shade responses may be overestimated 48 .

        <p>The effect of drive current on LED efficacy has been discussed above. Due to different types of efficiency reductions at high and low drive currents, efficiency can be maximized at some relatively low drive current (less than 100 mA). Fixture manufacturers seek to co-optimize fixture size, cost, output, and efficacy for specific applications. While low drive currents will increase the efficacy of the fixture, the output of each LED would be relatively low.

        <p>[LEDs degrade with time as a function of temperature and current density. L70 is a metric that indicates the time at which a fixture output is 70% of the original output (sometimes referred as Q70 for horticultural products). A typical L70 for LED fixtures is 50,000 h. As the LEDs and fixture age, the efficacy will decline; a problem that is exacerbated by high junction temperatures. Rates of fixture aging can vary greatly among manufacturers. Most manufacturers characterize their fixture lifetime (L70, L90, Q70, or Q90) in terms of LED output depreciation based on a standard LED package test-IES LM-80, which can be interpolated into luminaire lumen maintenance. Projections of luminaire lumen maintenance based on LED depreciation cannot exceed six times of the duration that the LEDs were tested, so for a depreciation lifetime claim of 60,000 h the LEDs must have been tested for 10,000 h. Many fixtures that claim extended lifetimes are exceeding the allowable six times interpolation based on LED testing. Fixture lifetimes based on LED depreciation also do not include optical loss mechanisms in the fixture and accelerated aging of the LEDs due to higher temperatures. Also, typical lifetime claims do not consider catastrophic failure of the LED driver, which often fails before the LEDs have reached the L70.] 3. LED drivers (also called power supplies) are necessary to convert AC to DC power and provide regulated voltage and current. The efficiency of LED drivers ranges from 85 to 95%.

        <p>4. Optical losses occur when LEDs are mounted in fixtures. The sides of the fixture can obstruct low-angle photons. Protective transparent covers (e.g., glass) transmit up to 92% of the photons and thus reduce the output by 8%, but this protection can significantly improve the lifetime of a fixture. Fixtures with unprotected LEDs can have 99% optical efficiency, but may have shorter lifetimes in harsh growing environments (e.g., high humidity).4.
