        <p>ABSTRACT. The concentration of radiocarbon ( 14 C) differs between ocean and atmosphere. Radiocarbon determinations from samples which obtained their 14 C in the marine environment therefore need a marine-specific calibration curve and cannot be calibrated directly against the atmospheric-based IntCal20 curve. This paper presents Marine20, an update to the internationally agreed marine radiocarbon age calibration curve that provides a non-polar global-average marine record of radiocarbon from 0-55 cal kBP and serves as a baseline for regional oceanic variation. Marine20 is intended for calibration of marine radiocarbon samples from non-polar regions; it is not suitable for calibration in polar regions where variability in sea ice extent, ocean upwelling and air-sea gas exchange may have caused larger changes to concentrations of marine radiocarbon. The Marine20 curve is based upon 500 simulations with an ocean/atmosphere/biosphere box-model of the global carbon cycle that has been forced by posterior realizations of our Northern Hemispheric atmospheric IntCal20 14 C curve and reconstructed changes in CO 2 obtained from ice core data. These forcings enable us to incorporate carbon cycle dynamics and temporal changes in the atmospheric 14 C level. The box-model simulations of the global-average marine radiocarbon reservoir age are similar to those of a more complex three-dimensional ocean general circulation model. However, simplicity and speed of the box model allow us to use a Monte Carlo approach to rigorously propagate the uncertainty in both the historic concentration of atmospheric 14 C and other key parameters of the carbon cycle through to our final Marine20 calibration curve. This robust propagation of uncertainty is fundamental to providing reliable precision for the radiocarbon age calibration of marine based samples. We make a first step towards deconvolving the contributions of different processes to the total uncertainty; discuss the main differences of Marine20 from the previous age calibration curve Marine13; and identify the limitations of ourABSTRACT.

        <p>In order to convert the radiocarbon ( 14 C) date of a sample into a calendar age we need to perform calibration. This depends upon creating an accurate estimate of 14 C concentration over time for the specific local environment in which the sample was exchanging carbon. From this, we can generate a calibration curve which provides estimates of the radiocarbon date at any particular calendar age. Comparison of the radiocarbon date for a sample of interest against this calibration curve then enables us to infer the potential calendar ages at which it stopped exchanging with its local environment.In order to convert the radiocarbon ( 14 C) date of a sample into a calendar age we need to perform calibration.

        <p>The reservoirs of 14 C within surface-ocean environments are systematically depleted compared to the atmosphere, and with higher frequency components in the variation predominantly damped. As a consequence, one cannot use the atmospheric calibration curve for the calibration of marine radiocarbon dates. The reasons for the depletion, and associated damping, are primarily the time it takes for atmospheric 14 C to exchange with the surface ocean and that the ocean interior stores large amounts of old carbon which slowly circulates up to the surface. To further complicate marine calibration, the level of depletion varies according to both location and time due to spatio-temporal differences in ocean mixing, various factors affecting the rates of air-sea exchange and wider changes to the carbon cycle, notably the atmospheric CO 2 mixing ratio (Bard 1988). To calibrate marine radiocarbon samples accurately, this varying and localised depletion must be accounted for.The reservoirs of 14 C within surface-ocean environments are systematically depleted compared to the atmosphere, and with higher frequency components in the variation predominantly damped.

        <p>The level of surface-ocean 14 C depletion, for a particular point in calendar time and a particular location, is typically expressed in terms of the marine radiocarbon reservoir age (hereafter Marine Reservoir Age or MRA) 1 .

        <p>Our Marine20 curve is constructed using the BICYCLE global carbon cycle model, a Boxmodel of the Isotopic Carbon cYCLE (Köhler andFischer 2004, 2006;Köhler et al. 2005Köhler et al. , 2006)). This model incorporates a globally averaged atmospheric box and modules of the terrestrial (7 boxes) and oceanic (10 boxes) components of the carbon cycle, including deep ocean-sediment fluxes of DIC and alkalinity that mimic the process of carbonate compensation. It is driven by temporal changes in the boundary conditions (changing climate) and simulates changes in the carbon cycle, including 13 C and 14 C. Here, we revise BICYCLE to allow the atmospheric CO 2 and ∆ 14 C to be specified externally by an icecore based reconstruction and the IntCal20 curve respectively, rather than using the values that BICYCLE calculates internally. In overriding BICYCLE's internally calculated CO 2 and ∆ 14 C with these two external, independently obtained, reconstructions arising from observed data, we aim to correct for any potential model limitations and ensure our simulated changes in the carbon cycle remain as close as possible to the observed ice core and 14 C data.Our Marine20 curve is constructed using the BICYCLE global carbon cycle model, a Boxmodel of the Isotopic Carbon cYCLE (Köhler andFischer 2004, 2006;Köhler et al. 2005Köhler et al. , 2006)).

        <p>We take a Monte-Carlo approach whereby we generate an ensemble of 500 BICYCLE simulations, each driven by a different potential reconstruction of atmospheric ∆ 14 C and CO 2 as well as other key carbon cycle parameters. Our CO 2 reconstructions are based upon a stack of multiple ice core records (Köhler et al. 2017), while our estimates of atmospheric ∆ 14 C from 0-55 cal kBP are taken from individual posterior realizations of the IntCal20 curve (Reimer et al. 2020 in this issue). By considering the variability in the resultant ensemble of BICYCLE simulations, we are able to propagate uncertainty about past carbon cycle dynamics through to our final Marine20 curve.

        <p>The proposed modeling approach offers a significant improvement over previous marine calibration curves, e.g. Marine04 (Hughen et al. 2004), Marine09 (Reimer et al. 2009) and Marine13 (Reimer et al. 2013). In these previous versions, the curves were generated in distinct sections and spliced together. For Marine13, the curve from 0-10.5 cal kBP was created using a time-invariant ocean-atmosphere box diffusion model (Oeschger et al. 1975) driven by the corresponding atmospheric IntCal13 pointwise means and a range of piston velocities and eddy diffusivities as described in Hughen et al. (2004). From 10.5-13.9 cal kBP, it was constructed based upon marine observations from a range of locations. Finally, beyond 13.9 cal kBP, Marine13 was identical to the atmospheric IntCal13 curve with a constant MRA offset of 405 14 C yr.The proposed modeling approach offers a significant improvement over previous marine calibration curves, e.g. Marine04 (Hughen et al. 2004), Marine09 (Reimer et al. 2009) and Marine13 (Reimer et al. 2013).

        <p>Conversely, for Marine20, the use of BICYCLE and of time-dependent forcings permit more complex and realistic inclusion of key carbon cycle changes extending back to 55 cal kBP. Additionally, improvements in the Bayesian modeling of IntCal20 (Heaton et al. 2020 in this issue) allow us for the first time to rigorously incorporate the time-dependent uncertainty of atmospheric ∆ 14 C into the marine age calibration curve through our Monte-Carlo approach. Together, these features enable more accurate estimation of both the global marine calibration curve and the globally averaged MRA, especially beyond the Holocene. We show that the results BICYCLE provides for individual runs are almost indistinguishable from the three dimensional Large Scale Geostrophic Ocean General Circulation Model (LSG OGCM) (Butzin et al. 2017(Butzin et al. , 2020 in this issue) in this issue) and that BICYCLE's model output agrees well with pre-bomb data based on seawater (Bard 1988) and marine shells (Reimer and Reimer 2001;Toggweiler et al. 2019).Conversely, for Marine20, the use of BICYCLE and of time-dependent forcings permit more complex and realistic inclusion of key carbon cycle changes extending back to 55 cal kBP.

        <p>While more complex ocean models such as the LSG OGCM exist, we deliberately retain the simpler BICYCLE box model since it is more appropriate for our specific, global-average, calibration needs. For practical radiocarbon calibration, we require not only a curve consisting of a single point estimate for the global marine ∆ 14 C at any calendar age but also a reliable measure of the uncertainty on that estimate. The use of the computationally fast BICYCLE box model allows us to create a large ensemble of simulations and hence, via Monte-Carlo, rigorously quantify the uncertainty in the modeled global-average marine ∆ 14 C level which is a necessary consequence of the uncertainty in our various model/climate inputs.While more complex ocean models such as the LSG OGCM exist, we deliberately retain the simpler BICYCLE box model since it is more appropriate for our specific, global-average, calibration needs.

        <p>The paper is set out as follows. In Section 2 we describe the requirements for a computer model in order to be suitable for use in construction of a radiocarbon age calibration curve; how uncertainty in the various driving inputs can be propagated through such a computer model; and provide a short tutorial on how the resultant output uncertainty can be quantified using Monte-Carlo techniques as well as why these Monte-Carlo techniques are needed. In Section 3, we justify our recommended approach to marine calibration of using local ∆R adjustments, based upon observations, to a global-average curve rather than solely upon tree-ring measurements from 0 to ca. 13.9 cal kBP. Beyond this a variety of data are used, including marine records which require an initial transformation to an atmospheric equivalent. To achieve this, a preliminary ∆ 14 C history is estimated based upon Hulu Cave speleothems (Southon et al. 2012;Cheng et al. 2018). This preliminary ∆ 14 C curve is used to drive the LSG OGCM and provide prior, first-order, estimates of regional MRAs (Butzin et al. 2020 in this issue) for each IntCal20 marine dataset, with the exception of the Cariaco Basin which is adjusted adaptively during curve construction (Hughen and Heaton 2020 in this issue). The adjusted marine data are then combined with speleothems, macrofossils from Lake Suigetsu, and floating tree-ring sequences to constitute a mixed, atmospheric and atmospheric-adjusted, dataset extending from ca. 13.9-55 cal kBP. A Bayesian spline is jointly fitted to both the tree-ring samples (from 0-13.9 cal kBP) and this mixed data (beyond 13.9 cal kBP) to create the IntCal20 curve (Heaton et al. 2020 in this issue). To generate Marine20, 500 posterior atmospheric ∆ 14 C realizations are taken from the IntCal20 Bayesian spline and propagated through the BICYCLE carbon cycle model alongside reconstructions of atmospheric CO 2 obtained from ice core records. The ensemble of 500 simulated outputs are then summarized to create the Marine20 curve. directly using regional output from more complex three-dimensional models. In Section 4 we present a short summary of BICYCLE and describe in detail the key processes/forcings and their uncertainties which we propagate through to our final calibration curve. We generate our ensemble of 500 
            <rs type="software">BICYCLE</rs> simulations across the plausible ranges of its key inputs and present the resultant Marine20 curve in Section 5. Here we also discuss differences with the previous Marine13 curve. In particular, we note that Marine20 estimates a significant, and consistent, increase in the globally averaged MRA when compared to Marine13. With a sensitivity analysis we also document how much the different processes contribute to the overall uncertainty in Marine20. Section 6 provides a comparison against simulations with the more complex LSG OGCM and against both current day (pre-bomb) global marine data and older marine data from the IntCal20 database. Here we show that the increase, when compared to Marine13, in the global-average MRA in Marine20 is in agreement with average pre-bomb observations and the LSG OGCM. Finally, in Section 7 we discuss the limitations of our approach alongside areas needed for future work and development. For those seeking further details on the model output, including the final Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve, the spatially resolved regional open-ocean MRA estimates from the LSG OGCM, as well as the 500 NH atmospheric ∆ 14 C realizations used as inputs for our Monte-Carlo ensemble, see PANGAEA (https://doi.org/ 10.1594/PANGAEA.914500).

        <p>For a calibration end-user, it is key to note that the update from Marine13 to Marine20 is accompanied by updates to the regional ∆R corrections which can be found at http://calib. org/marine/. This is particularly critical since Marine20 estimates a significantly increased globally averaged MRA.

        <p>Our Marine20 curve is intended for calibration of marine 14 C samples arising from non-polar locations, nominally/approximately ranging from 40ºS-40/50ºN. In higher-latitude polar regions, MRAs and critically their possible fluctuations over time are expected to be larger due to significantly increased variability in ocean ventilation and air-sea gas exchange mostly arising from changes in sea ice extent and differences in wind strength (Butzin et al. 2005). This is particularly likely to be the case during glacial periods. LSG OGCM estimates for the MRA in a particular calendar year within polar regions can vary by over 1000 14 C yr between a simulation assuming a climate scenario suitable for the present day (its PD scenario which assumes little sea ice, Butzin et al. 2005Butzin et al. , 2020 in this issue) and runs in climate scenarios appropriate for more extreme glacial periods (e.g. its GS/CS scenarios where the extent of sea ice is much greater in addition to significant changes to ocean ventilation and wind stress). This difference indicates that uncertainty in past polar climate conditions can have a significant effect on calibration in these regions. Consequently, for those polar regions affected by such additional variability, an assumption of a constant ∆R adjustment from our equatorial Marine20 global-average is not suitable. The current Marine20 curve is not therefore suitable for calibration in these polar regions.Our Marine20 curve is intended for calibration of marine 14 C samples arising from non-polar locations, nominally/approximately ranging from 40ºS-40/50ºN.

        <p>Current proxy records for such ocean ventilation, sea ice extent and wind strength are not sufficient to reliably reconstruct these variables to permit accurate and precise modeling of polar calibration curves. Construction of such polar curves would be a valuable area for future study which we discuss in more detail within Section 7. For current users wishing to calibrate marine 14 C samples from polar locations where variability in sea ice and ocean circulation may have significantly affected MRAs, we direct them to the regional LSG OGCM output as discussed in Section 3 and available on PANGAEA. Such users should however be aware that each individual LSG OGCM simulation only considers a single climate scenario. Due to the very considerable uncertainty on the appropriate historic polar climatic conditions, and since the impact of different climate scenarios on MRA in these regions is very large, resultant polar calibration based upon such fixed scenarios should be treated with extreme caution. The calibrated age estimates obtained under any single fixed scenario are likely to be considerably over-precise.Current proxy records for such ocean ventilation, sea ice extent and wind strength are not sufficient to reliably reconstruct these variables to permit accurate and precise modeling of polar calibration curves. Construction of such polar curves would be a valuable area for future study which we discuss in more detail within Section 7.

        <p>The use of models for the study and prediction of MRA extends back to Craig (1957), Arnold (1957), Revelle and Suess (1957) and was updated later by Oeschger et al. (1975) with the introduction of a diffusion coefficient to simulate mixing in the deep ocean box (eddy diffusivity). This so-called box-diffusion model has been fundamental to the construction of the marine radiocarbon age calibration curve since 1986 (Stuiver et al. 1986). Over that time, the complexity of these models has increased as we have gained more knowledge of both the Earth systems and past climate constraints. Recent approaches include more advanced carbon cycle box models which allow transient forward simulations such as BICYCLE (Köhler et al. 2006) through to full three-dimensional ocean general circulation models such as the LSG OGCM (Butzin et al. 2005(Butzin et al. , 2012(Butzin et al. , 2017(Butzin et al. , 2020 in this issue) in this issue). For all of these models, the basic principle is the same: given a specific user-defined set of inputs/ parameters, they provide an estimate/prediction of the variable of interest, in our case the non-polar global-average marine ∆ 14 C, where this average in the following is restricted to the area between 40°S and either 50°N (Atlantic) or 40°N (Pacific) to avoid the potential complications of including regions covered with sea ice (e.g. Butzin et al. 2017).The use of models for the study and prediction of MRA extends back to Craig (1957), Arnold (1957), Revelle and Suess (1957) and was updated later by Oeschger et al.

        <p>The most useful computer model for a particular situation will depend upon the specific question one wishes to answer. For Marine20, we wish to not only obtain a reliable estimate of the global-average marine 14 C concentration over time incorporating known changes in both the carbon cycle and atmospheric 14 C production rate, but also to be able to quantify our uncertainty on that estimate. Such quantification of uncertainty is fundamental to radiocarbon calibration. When calibrating a radiocarbon date, we need not only a best "point estimate" for its calendar age but also a plausible range, i.e. to understand the uncertainty on our calibrated calendar age. These two competing aims of reliability and uncertainty quantification typically require a trade-off in model selection.The most useful computer model for a particular situation will depend upon the specific question one wishes to answer.

        <p>In the case of a deterministic computer model, output uncertainty arises from two sources (see Section 2 of Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001). The first is model parameter uncertainty, i.e. that, typically, we do not know the true value of the model's input parameters. We specify our uncertainty on our computer model inputs in terms of a distribution φ π φ that encapsulates our current understanding about their values. The second source of uncertainty is model discrepancy, i.e. that any computer model is not an entirely accurate representation of reality and will not capture the complete carbon cycle of the Earth. This type of uncertainty is much harder to evaluate but one might expect a more complex and detailed model to typically have a smaller model discrepancy. We do not attempt to formally incorporate model discrepancy into Marine20 but we are able to incorporate model parameter uncertainty.In the case of a deterministic computer model, output uncertainty arises from two sources (see Section 2 of Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001).

        <p>To perform accurate Monte-Carlo estimation, it is necessary to generate a sufficiently large ensemble N of outputs in order that they provide reliable estimates. Here, we selected N=500 based on a smaller pilot study which indicated such a sample size would provide Monte-Carlo estimates that were within ±1% of the true model mean, and ±5% of the true model variance. This requires repeated model simulations and so it is necessary to have a model that is sufficiently fast to permit this. 
            <rs type="software">BICYCLE</rs> provides an appropriate compromise between reducing model discrepancy while still running with sufficient computational speed to enable creation of a large ensemble of outputs and hence accurately propagate model parameter uncertainty. As we show later in Figure 4 and Section 6, there are only small differences between the global-average MRA obtained from individual BICYCLE simulations and from the more complex 3D LSG OGCM alternative, yet each BICYCLE simulation can be performed in seconds rather than the weeks required for the LSG OGCM.

        <p>To be of use for calibration, it is essential to accurately represent the full range of uncertainty in the level of marine radiocarbon. When calibrating a radiocarbon determination, we need to discover all calendar ages which are potentially consistent with that level of 14 C. As such we are required to understand the variability in the output of our, complex and non-linear, carbon cycle computer model. This is somewhat different from much modeling which aims to test specific scenarios. As described in Section 2, in order to capture the full variability in the computer model output we must explore the full range of input scenarios.To be of use for calibration, it is essential to accurately represent the full range of uncertainty in the level of marine radiocarbon.

These global-scale MRA changes are incorporated, by construction, in our global-average Marine20 curve and hence automatically taken into account for all calibration users wishing to use the Marine20 curve.It is expected that the most significant temporal changes in MRA will be shared and hence occur on a global scale rather than in individual regions, i.e. changes in values over time will predominantly be seen in R GlobalAv θ as opposed to the regional ∆R θ adjustments (Stuiver et al. 1986).

Furthermore, these regional open-ocean MRA estimates had similar shapes to the non-polar global-average MRA.

This includes the LSG OGCM.

            <rs type="software">IntCal</rs>20. One would initially identify the regional open-ocean LSG OGCM site that lies closest to the particular location of interest, before then applying a constant, baseline-specific, pseudo-∆R shift from this specific regional open-ocean LSG OGCM estimate. However, extending this approach to Marine20 would be complex and reliant upon users identifying both the correct LSG OGCM regional baseline and the matching pseudo-∆R shift.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, for the non-polar sites illustrated in Figure 4, the relative shapes of the regional open-ocean MRAs estimated by the LSG OGCM are highly similar to both the LSG globalaverage estimate and also the mean BICYCLE global-average estimate. Changing to two alternative scenarios (CS or PD, Butzin et al. 2020 estimates-the primary effect of such scenario changes are simply constant shifts, up and down respectively, in each regional open-ocean MRA estimate albeit with the size of these shifts potentially varying between regions.Furthermore, for the non-polar sites illustrated in Figure 4, the relative shapes of the regional open-ocean MRAs estimated by the LSG OGCM are highly similar to both the LSG globalaverage estimate and also the mean BICYCLE global-average estimate.

        <p>Consequently, the difference in using constant pseudo-∆R-type shifts from regional LSG OGCM curves, as opposed to constant ∆R shifts from the global-average curves, would be small for these sites. As a result, the proposed approach to radiocarbon age calibration described here, of using a global-average Marine20 radiocarbon age calibration curve based on BICYCLE with application of constant ∆R shifts, is consistent with an approach using regional LSG OGCM curves while also being much simpler and more efficient.Consequently, the difference in using constant pseudo-∆R-type shifts from regional LSG OGCM curves, as opposed to constant ∆R shifts from the global-average curves, would be small for these sites.

        <p>As discussed in more detail in Section 6, the output from the LSG OGCM matches that from BICYCLE at the global-average level suggesting that BICYCLE is a satisfactory model at this broader scale. However, by running much more quickly than the full LSG OCGM, BICYCLE provides greatly more flexibility which provides several key benefits for our calibration curve needs. In particular, LSG (or any other current OGCM) is too computationally expensive to carry out a rigorous exploration of the uncertainty in its output. The use of BICYCLE enables us to explore a much wider range of potential carbon cycle scenarios. Further, the LSG OGCM simulations were kept in a single scenario for the entire period from 0-55 cal kBP. The effect of a transient switch from a glacial scenario to an interglacial, more suitable for the Holocene, within a simulation was therefore unknown. With BICYCLE we can more easily investigate the effect of such scenario changes.As discussed in more detail in Section 6, the output from the LSG OGCM matches that from BICYCLE at the global-average level suggesting that BICYCLE is a satisfactory model at this broader scale.

        <p>Our BICYCLE approach attempts to minimise potential inaccuracies in marine radiocarbon variability that stem from strictly unknown changes in the marine carbon cycle by exploring a wide range of possible carbon cycle states, providing a trade-off between expected accuracy and precision in resulting calibrated ages. As we describe later in Section 7, key future work lies in developing 3D OGCM models which can provide region-specific output further and understanding their inherent uncertainties. Work towards this goal would be invaluable in improving both marine calibration and our insight into the global carbon cycle.Our BICYCLE approach attempts to minimise potential inaccuracies in marine radiocarbon variability that stem from strictly unknown changes in the marine carbon cycle by exploring a wide range of possible carbon cycle states, providing a trade-off between expected accuracy and precision in resulting calibrated ages.

        <p>BICYCLE is a global carbon cycle box model that includes terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanic modules (Köhler and Fischer 2004;Köhler et al. 2005). The terrestrial biosphere is modeled with seven different compartments distinguishing C 3 and C 4 photosynthesis, and soils with different turnover times; the atmosphere as a single globally averaged box; and the ocean as a set of ten boxes covering different spatial regions (both equatorial and high latitude) and ocean depths including deep ocean-sediment exchange fluxes. Prognostic variables solved by the model are C (as DIC in the ocean, as CO 2 in the atmosphere), 13 C, and 14 C in all boxes, and additionally alkalinity, O 2 , and PO 4 in the ocean. The marine carbonate system is fully defined by the two variables DIC and alkalinity. The model design has been chosen to allow long-term (thousands of years) transient simulations, but still capture the essential processes important for the global carbon cycle and carbon isotopes. Temporal changes in the physical boundary conditions (temperature, ocean circulation, sea ice extent, sea level, aeolian dust/iron input, 14 C production rate) are prescribed, and thus changes in the simulated subsystem of the global carbon cycle are externally forced.

        <p>• Atmospheric CO 2 in the standard BICYCLE setup is a prognostic variable, i.e. is internally calculated rather than externally forced/prescribed. BICYCLE's simulated CO 2 time series has been in reasonable agreement with ice core data, but never matched them perfectly. However, for our current application we have decided to override BICYCLE's internal CO 2 estimates and instead prescribe CO 2 from ice core data (Figure 5, based on Köhler et al. 2017). This decision was made since the air-sea gas exchange, one of the key processes determining the simulated surface ocean ∆ 14 C, is significantly dependent on the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 . In making this change, the internally calculated carbon cycle is partly corrected by an additional source/sink term in the atmosphere to arrive at the prescribed ice core reconstructed CO 2 value. This is a common approach in carbon cycle model applications for future scenarios, in which not CO 2 emissions, but CO 2 concentrations are prescribed, and has recently been implemented in BICYCLE for its contribution to a carbon cycle modelintercomparison (Keller et al. 2018).• Atmospheric CO 2 in the standard BICYCLE setup is a prognostic variable, i.e. is internally calculated rather than externally forced/prescribed.

        <p>Piston velocity is the rate of air-sea gas exchange and depends on near-surface wind speed. Thus, this parameter is important for the oceanic uptake of 14 C from the atmosphere. In all previous applications, it was parametrized to 2.5 × 10 -5 and 7.5 × 10 -5 ms -1 , for the equatorial and high latitude surface boxes respectively (Heimann and Monfray 1989). These values agree reasonably well with more recent estimates (Wanninkhof 2014). To create Marine20, we maintain these values as the mean piston velocities but introduce uncertainty by placing a prior on each informed by a meta-analysis as described below.Piston velocity is the rate of air-sea gas exchange and depends on near-surface wind speed.

We combine these values using a statistically rigorous meta-analysis (Figure 6) to give an estimate for the average present day piston velocity of k N 17; 1:4 2 cm hr -1 (or equivalently N(4.7, 0.39 2 ) 10 -5 ms -1 ), i.e. the 1σ uncertainty on the level of piston velocity with present day climate is approximately ±10%.</p>
        <p>Further uncertainty arises as a result of changing past climate, in particular different wind speeds. From the LSG OGCM (Butzin et al. 2017(Butzin et al. , 2020 in this issue) we obtain (Table 1) gas exchange rates based on 10-year averaged monthly model results for three different climate scenarios (PD, GS and CS, Butzin et al. 2005).Further uncertainty arises as a result of changing past climate, in particular different wind speeds.

        <p>We use these values to indicate the potential additional variability introduced by different past climate scenarios. These estimates suggest that, due to changes in climate, the mean piston velocity might change, within any particular basin, from its present day value by approximately another ±10% (at 1σ based upon the difference in the LSG OGCM estimates between the interglacial PD scenario and the glacial scenario CS). Finally, we combine the uncertainty on the present day value (±10%) with the LSG-based intra-basin climate variation (±10%) to get an approximate combined uncertainty of 0:1 2 0:1 2 p ' 0:15; i.e. σ = 15%. This uncertainty is comparable with the ±20% proposed by Wanninkhof (2014) for the mean value of the present ocean.We use these values to indicate the potential additional variability introduced by different past climate scenarios.

        <p>The strength of the AMOC, expressed by NADW formation, presumably varied between a weak glacial and a strong interglacial mode. In our model, the switch between both is a function of North Atlantic sea surface temperature and has been chosen such that the interglacial mode is reached at the onset of the Holocene. In each mode, we assume a constant, but unknown NADW value drawn from a suitable prior representing the two different strengths.

        <p>We provide, in addition to the comparison of BICYCLE's non-polar global-average (i.e. equatorial box) surface ocean output against observational data and the LSG OGCM estimates of MRA provided in Section 6, a further model validation from deep ocean 14 C data. Specifically, we consider the level of 14 C depletion, in terms of radiocarbon years, between the atmosphere and BICYCLE's three deep-ocean boxes which cover the global ocean deeper than 1000 m. The weighted average from all 500 BICYCLE simulations of these deep ocean boxes indicate that their 14 C depletion decreases from the LGM (23-18 cal kBP) to pre-bomb values (0 cal kBP) by 605 ± 103 14 C yr. This is slightly less, but agrees within the uncertainties, with the 689 ± 53 14 C yr age difference of the volumeweighted global mean ocean between those two time windows obtained from a modelbased interpolation of 256 deep ocean 14 C samples (Skinner et al. 2017) and illustrates that the changes in ocean circulation assumed in BICYCLE are within reasonable bounds.We provide, in addition to the comparison of BICYCLE's non-polar global-average (i.e. equatorial box) surface ocean output against observational data and the LSG OGCM estimates of MRA provided in Section 6, a further model validation from deep ocean 14 C data.

        <p>Figure 7B shows the ensemble of corresponding estimates of non-polar global-average MRA, i.e. the depletion, in terms of radiocarbon years, between the atmosphere and the non-polar global-average marine surface ocean over time. Note that each MRA estimate in the ensemble of BICYCLE outputs is coupled to a specific realization of atmospheric 14 C. We also plot, in Figure 10, the complete Marine20 curve in the radiocarbon age domain against unadjusted 14 C observations from corals and forams obtained from the marine environment (some of which were used to create IntCal20 and hence also influence Marine20). Here, we also show the atmospheric IntCal20 curve. This is discussed further in Section 6. Marine20 (Figure 7A) shows a similar shape to Marine13 but with a significantly lower ∆ 14 C between ~15 and ~32 cal kBP, and beyond 42 cal KBP, indicating a larger global-average MRA in Marine20 than in Marine13. During the Holocene, i.e. from 0-11.6 cal kBP, Marine20 shows an approximate constant ∆ 14 C deficit to the atmosphere with a globalaverage MRA of around 500 14 C yr although, as expected, sharp changes in atmospheric ∆ 14 C are smoothed in the marine environment. Here, the carbon cycle model elements within BICYCLE, as indicated by the atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (Figure 5), remain fairly constant. For most of this 0-11.6 cal kBP time period, Marine13 is based on a timeconstant box diffusion model (Hughen et al. 2004), albeit with a different parameter choice, and so similar longitudinal changes in MRA might be expected.Figure 7B shows the ensemble of corresponding estimates of non-polar global-average MRA, i.e. the depletion, in terms of radiocarbon years, between the atmosphere and the non-polar global-average marine surface ocean over time.

        <p>Beyond 11.6 cal kBP, we see the effect of the carbon cycle changes within Marine20. The marine 14 C deficit decreases as the atmospheric CO 2 concentration and temperature rose from their lower glacial into their higher Holocene values and atmospheric ∆ 14 C decreased.Beyond 11.6 cal kBP, we see the effect of the carbon cycle changes within Marine20.

        <p>From 20-30 cal kBP, the global-average MRA was 750-1000 14 C yr (Figure 7B). These higher global-average MRA values are accompanied by larger temporal variations, likely a consequence of the increased variation in atmospheric ∆ 14 C. Further back in time than this, the global-average MRA shows two local minima of 600 14 C yr around 33 and 38 cal kBP, into which global-average MRA decreased from its maximum value of 1400 14 Cy r connected with the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion (approximately 41-42 cal kBP, Lascu et al. 2016). These high MRA values are likely predominantly driven by the corresponding large increase in atmospheric ∆ 14 C seen in IntCal20. Note however, that this peak in MRA around the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion coincides with the inflection point in atmospheric ∆ 14 C, predating the actual ∆ 14 C peak by about 3000 years. This feature is also discussed in more detail in Butzin et al. (2020 in this issue).From 20-30 cal kBP, the global-average MRA was 750-1000 14 C yr (Figure 7B).

        <p>It is in this older period, beyond 13.9 cal kBP, where the improvement in methodology leading to different results between Marine20 and Marine13 is most evident. Beyond 13.9 cal kBP, Marine13 assumed a constant reservoir age of 405 14 C yr since, for the creation of that curve, the ability to incorporate carbon cycle changes was limited. The use of BICYCLE for the construction of Marine20 addresses this and permits us more realistic MRA estimation extending into the glacial time period.It is in this older period, beyond 13.9 cal kBP, where the improvement in methodology leading to different results between Marine20 and Marine13 is most evident.

        <p>A more detailed understanding on the importance of the different processes contained in Marine20 can be gained from sensitivity simulations where we select a subset of the inputs to 
            <rs type="software">BICYCLE</rs> to vary, while holding others fixed. Initially, we consider two simulations which give an indication as to the effect that past changes to climate and CO 2 concentration have on our global-average ocean mixed-layer 14 C estimates. In both these simulations, for simplicity, we only drive BICYCLE by the pointwise-mean atmospheric ∆ 14 C values as opposed to ranging over individual realizations. In the first such simulation, all time-dependent boundary conditions constraining climate (temperature, sea level, ocean circulation) are held constant at their level used for 0 cal BP; in the second simulation, in addition to climate, the CO 2 concentration is also kept constant (Figure 7A). When keeping both constant, BICYCLE's results between 20 and 30 cal kBP agree more closely with Marine13. This is to be expected since, for the Marine13 curve, these two aspects were not considered to have varied. Roughly speaking, both the changing climate and the changing CO 2 concentration appear to contribute about the same to Marine20, while the dominant contribution of changes in MRA are caused by variable atmospheric ∆ 14 C.
        </p>
        <p>In a further set of sensitivity studies, we provide an insight into how each individual process (with its specified prior) contributes to the overall uncertainty in Marine20 by comparing the varying level of uncertainty in BICYCLE's model output when we only propagate uncertainty in selected model inputs. This aims to identify, should we wish to reduce the uncertainty in model output for future work, which are the key processes and parameters on which we must increase our knowledge, and equally which are less critical. Here, we do not consider potential interactions between input variables (Oakley and O'Hagan 2004) in contributing to overall model uncertainty but only the main effects. We performed four additional sets of 500 simulations. In our base scenario (simulation S0) only the uncertainty in atmospheric ∆ 14 C was propagated through BICYCLE, achieved by ranging over the 500 posterior ∆ 14 C realizations taken from IntCal20, with all other model inputs, i.e. atmospheric CO 2 , piston velocity and AMOC, held fixed at their mean, but still timedependent, values. The other three scenarios build on this base case and consider the further effect on model output when the additional, previously described, uncertainties in each of the further BICYCLE inputs: atmospheric CO 2 (S1), piston velocity (S2) and AMOC (S3) have also been propagated alongside the uncertainty in atmospheric ∆ 14 C. By subtracting the uncertainty in BICYCLE's global-average marine ∆ 14 C output in S0 from those obtained in S1-S3 we obtained an estimate of the additional contributions of these processes to the overall uncertainty in Marine20.In a further set of sensitivity studies, we provide an insight into how each individual process (with its specified prior) contributes to the overall uncertainty in Marine20 by comparing the varying level of uncertainty in BICYCLE's model output when we only propagate uncertainty in selected model inputs.

        <p>From these sensitivity tests (Figure 8A) we learn that, for the last 31 cal kBP, the uncertainty in Marine20 is largely dominated by the uncertainty in piston velocity, with initially only a small contribution from the uncertainty in atmospheric ∆ 14 C. Beyond 31 cal kBP however, the uncertainty in atmospheric ∆ 14 C becomes the dominant contributor to Marine20's uncertainty. The effect of uncertainty in atmospheric CO 2 is negligible and that of AMOC also very minor (&lt;1.5‰ in terms of ∆ 14 C) although, as explained earlier, we do not incorporate the potential full range of millennial-scale AMOC variability such as its possible shutdown during Heinrich events. For details on the effect of completely shutting down or switching off the various components of the time-dependent climate forcing in BICYCLE, see Figure 5 in Köhler et al. (2006). Large changes in the precision of our atmospheric ∆ 14 C IntCal20 estimate, ranging from the Holocene where it is known very precisely through to the older glacial period where it is much more uncertain, do not penetrate through to Marine20, but are smoothed out by the carbon cycle. The individual contributions nearly add up to the entire uncertainty in Marine20, but between 13-47 cal kBP there is a small positive difference between the combined uncertainty seen in Marine20 and the sum of individual contributions, especially around the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion. Interestingly, the mean of Marine20 is seen to some degree to depend on the considered uncertainties: it differs from the mean in S0 by up to 4‰ in ∆ 14 C (Figure 8B), illustrating nicely the non-linear nature of the error propagation (cf. Section 2).From these sensitivity tests (Figure 8A) we learn that, for the last 31 cal kBP, the uncertainty in Marine20 is largely dominated by the uncertainty in piston velocity, with initially only a small contribution from the uncertainty in atmospheric ∆ 14 C.

        <p>The LSG model is a three-dimensional ocean general circulation model incorporating more processes (ocean physics) than a box model. Furthermore, it has the ability to provide location-specific MRAs. Consequently, one might expect the LSG OGCM to provide more detailed and accurate modeling of the global-average marine 14 C reservoir than BICYCLE, albeit without the current ability to propagate model parameter uncertainty via Monte-Carlo.The LSG model is a three-dimensional ocean general circulation model incorporating more processes (ocean physics) than a box model.

        <p>As discussed in Section 3, the LSG OGCM was applied in three different climate scenarios: PD, CS and GS. Details are found in Table 1 and elsewhere (Butzin et al. 2005(Butzin et al. , 2012(Butzin et al. , 2017(Butzin et al. , 2020 in this issue) in this issue). Similarly to BICYCLE, the model was forced with the temporal changes in the atmospheric carbon records of CO 2 (Köhler et al. 2017) and IntCal20's reconstruction of ∆ 14 C (Reimer et al. 2020 in this issue), although using the pointwise means rather than individual realizations.As discussed in Section 3, the LSG OGCM was applied in three different climate scenarios: PD, CS and GS.

        <p>For each scenario, the LSG OGCM provided estimates of surface MRAs averaged over 50ºN-50ºS for the ocean surface above 50 m depth. These are shown in Figure 7B alongside the BICYCLE estimates with their 95% probability intervals. As can be seen, despite BICYCLE being a much simpler model, the BICYCLE estimates retain almost all of the temporal details present within the spatially averaged results from the LSG OGCM. BICYCLE's probability interval also covers the range of LSG scenarios. Users should however be aware that the LSG scenario which has the highest agreement with the mean output from BICYCLE is that with present day climate (PD). This emphasises, that although comparable, climate change over our time window of interest leads to different implications in the two models when considered in detail. Nevertheless, the overall model comparison suggests that, despite its simplicity, BICYCLE is able to provide a robust and accurate global estimate.For each scenario, the LSG OGCM provided estimates of surface MRAs averaged over 50ºN-50ºS for the ocean surface above 50 m depth.

        <p>We also compare Marine20 against pre-bomb (0-200 cal BP) marine observations (Reimer and Reimer 2001). In this comparison, it should be noted that these observations include regions of coastal upwelling and further, due to sampling biases, much of this data arise from the Western US coast, so may not be representative of the open ocean. Both data and model have not been corrected for fossil fuel contamination (Suess effect), thus should be comparable. Note that BICYCLE has previously been shown to track the Suess effect sufficiently accurately, even when applied without forced atmospheric ∆ 14 C and CO 2 (Köhler et al. 2014;Köhler 2016). We restrict our comparison to marine data from 50ºN-50ºS, to remove potential effects due to sea ice cover, and show the comparison in both ∆ 14 C and radiocarbon age space (Figure 9, panels A and B). The previous Marine13 estimates are also shown. Figure 9C shows a zoomed-in plot of the estimated global-average MRA over this period.We also compare Marine20 against pre-bomb (0-200 cal BP) marine observations (Reimer and Reimer 2001).

        <p>Although an over-time decreasing trend in ∆ 14 C due to the Suess effect seems visible in the observed marine data from ca. 1900 CE onward (i.e. 50-0 cal BP) it is statistically nonsignificant (p-value 0.35). Results are nearly identical when restricted to 40ºN-40ºS in the data selection, although this leads to a weighted ∆ 14 C mean of only -58‰. In the prebomb time window, the global-average MRA in Marine20 drops from slightly above 550 14 C yr at 200 cal BP to ~410 14 C at 0 cal BP, mostly due to the Suess effect seen in the atmospheric IntCal20 ∆ 14 C. This most-recent trend is also very closely reproduced in the simulations with the LSG OGCM (Figure 9C).Although an over-time decreasing trend in ∆ 14 C due to the Suess effect seems visible in the observed marine data from ca. 1900 CE onward (i.e. 50-0 cal BP) it is statistically nonsignificant (p-value 0.35).

        <p>The increase in the ∆ in a calibration curve which provides better agreement with our observed present-day observations. As seen in Figure 9A and 9B, the majority of these marine observations have an older radiocarbon age (i.e. their ∆ 14 C is lower) than Marine13 and lie closer to Marine20. A further analysis suggested that the optimal offset to Marine20, in terms of maximising the statistical likelihood of the observed present-day data shown in Figure 9, was only 30 14 C yr.

        <p>We plot here the raw 14 C ages of the observations, with no MRA or ∆R correction, along with their 95% probability intervals in both radiocarbon and calendar age. Since we have made no marine radiocarbon age correction for the observations in the plot, we would not expect the Marine20 curve to necessarily fit the raw data themselves. Rather our interest is in whether the offset from the curve (i.e. ∆R) is consistent for each dataset or location. Since marine data from older than 13.91 cal kBP does influence the construction of IntCal20, and hence also Marine20, the Marine20 curve is not entirely independent of the plotted data for this time periodalthough the large volume of other data informing IntCal20 still mean it is significantly so. From 0-13.91 cal kBP, the Marine20 curve is almost entirely independent of the plotted data since no marine data informed IntCal20 in this more recent period.We plot here the raw 14 C ages of the observations, with no MRA or ∆R correction, along with their 95% probability intervals in both radiocarbon and calendar age.

        <p>As with the present-day observations discussed in the previous section, most of this marine data is coastal and hence may not be representative of open-ocean. Most of the corals are seen to lie below the Marine20 curve suggesting that the locations of these data (Tahiti, Barbados, Vanuatu, Papua and Kiritimati) have a rather smaller region-specific MRA than the Marine20 global-average estimates, i.e. have a negative ∆R. For the period between 7 and 12 cal kBP (i.e. the early Holocene) we also see that the MRA for Tahiti is consistently smaller than for Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, which is compatible with previous work (e.g. Table 1 in Reimer et al. 2009). Beyond 12 cal kBP systematic differences are more difficult to detect because the analytical precision is lower.As with the present-day observations discussed in the previous section, most of this marine data is coastal and hence may not be representative of open-ocean.

        <p>Interestingly, between 15 and 17 cal kBP, the Iberian Margin data seem several centuries too old in 14 C yr compared with the Marine20 curve. This age range corresponds to the Heinrich 1 stadial and is potentially compatible with the near collapse of AMOC during Heinrich events which are not incorporated into BICYCLE and therefore missing in Marine20. It is harder to detect if this effect is also present in older Heinrich events since the precision of 14 C ages decreases through time, and some of these older events may have also had reduced intensity.Interestingly, between 15 and 17 cal kBP, the Iberian Margin data seem several centuries too old in 14 C yr compared with the Marine20 curve.

        <p>The most recent of these drops in MRA within the Cariaco Basin, at approximately 12.8 cal kBP, is evidenced by a reduction in the observed offset between 14 C samples of varved basin foraminifera and NH atmospheric 14 C tree-ring determinations. This drop occurs over a relatively short period of 200-300 calendar years. The older three drops (ca. 17, 23, and 31 cal kBP) potentially appear on longer, multi-millennia, scales. Due to the inability of our current carbon-cycle models to reproduce Cariaco's MRA, in order to include the Cariaco data within IntCal20, the basin's MRA beyond ca. 13.91 cal kBP was modeled as an additional flexible Bayesian spline simultaneously to the construction of the IntCal20 calibration curve (Heaton et al. 2020 in this issue; Hughen and Heaton 2020 in this issue).The most recent of these drops in MRA within the Cariaco Basin, at approximately 12.8 cal kBP, is evidenced by a reduction in the observed offset between 14 C samples of varved basin foraminifera and NH atmospheric 14 C tree-ring determinations.

        <p>Intuitively with this approach, deviations in 14 C levels within Cariaco that were also seen in other atmosphere-adjusted IntCal20 records would likely be considered genuine atmospheric signal. Conversely, deviations seen in Cariaco 14 C levels alone would likely be modeled as changes in the basin's MRA. The consequent Cariaco MRA estimate from 13.91-55 cal kBP is therefore predominantly influenced by the offset between the observed Cariaco 14 C data and the Hulu Cave speleothems, for which we assumed that the dead carbon fraction (DCF) remains approximately constant.Intuitively with this approach, deviations in 14 C levels within Cariaco that were also seen in other atmosphere-adjusted IntCal20 records would likely be considered genuine atmospheric signal.

        <p>Regarding future potential areas of development, most directly, new records at key locations in the oceans would help to improve the resolution and accuracy of existing marine records. This might be further refined by integrating marine records for the sea surface, intermediate and deep-water masses through parallel studies of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, warm and cold water corals, studying and correcting the influence of signal perturbations (e.g. deep-sea sediment mixing, diagenesis of corals). Future work will benefit from recent analytical improvements such as the capacity to measure 14 C in individual shells of foraminifera (Lougheed et al. 2018;Fagault et al. 2019). Prescribing time varying piston velocity and AMOC values estimated from paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic records, in particular over the glacial-interglacial/stadial-interstadial climate system fluctuations, instead of using the present two-level representation may provide further insights.Regarding future potential areas of development, most directly, new records at key locations in the oceans would help to improve the resolution and accuracy of existing marine records.

        <p>To use such OGCMs appropriately, more detailed investigations of their properties and inherent uncertainties would be equally valuable, perhaps through the creation of statistical emulators (Sacks et al. 1989). This is complicated by the high-dimensional functional output of these complex OGCMs. Two potential approaches in such situations are the use of basis functions (Higdon et al. 2008) to emulate the complete OGCM output; or perhaps more practically to emulate the deviations of the complex OGCM from a simpler, approximate, but fast model such as BICYCLE (Kennedy and O'Hagan 2000).To use such OGCMs appropriately, more detailed investigations of their properties and inherent uncertainties would be equally valuable, perhaps through the creation of statistical emulators (Sacks et al. 1989).

Work could then be directed at narrowing down our uncertainties on these specific key values. While we performed a first step towards identifying these processes, we did not consider the contribution of potential interactions between inputs. In the case of scalar model output, Oakley and O'Hagan (2004) provide a method to do so although this would need modification to account for our functional and high-dimensional output. Further, such emulators may aid in tuning (also known as calibration within the statistical community) our OGCMs to synthesize their predictions with our observations (Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001).Such emulators would enable us to identify the key parameters which influence model output, and equally which are less critical.

        <p>If the next generation of marine radiocarbon age calibration curve still relies on the application of the BICYCLE carbon cycle box model some emphasis might be necessary on the inclusion of uncertainties in all time-dependent forcing, including a revision of the forcing itself. In particular, further constraints on air-sea gas exchange (piston velocity), which has a large effect on the marine 14 C reservoir age, will be essential. In a similar vein, the current models neglect millennial-scale changes in the Atlantic meridional circulation. While this could in principle be incorporated to address more accurately reconstructed changes in the ocean circulation, sensitivity tests have shown that the simulated carbon cycle response to such rather abrupt changes is very model dependent (Köhler et al. 2006).If the next generation of marine radiocarbon age calibration curve still relies on the application of the BICYCLE carbon cycle box model some emphasis might be necessary on the inclusion of uncertainties in all time-dependent forcing, including a revision of the forcing itself.

        <p>In this paper we have presented an overview of the construction of the Marine20 globalaverage marine radiocarbon age calibration curve from 0-55 cal kBP. In this respect "global" is restricted to non-polar latitudes ranging approximately from 40/50°N to 40°S, i.e. excluding areas with sea ice. The curve is constructed using the BICYCLE carbon cycle Marine20 Calibration Curve 815 box model driven by estimates of atmospheric ∆ 14 C provided by IntCal20, by atmospheric CO 2 from ice cores, and by various other records changing the climatic boundary conditions. Together, these forcing time series enable us to incorporate past changes in both the carbon cycle and 14 C production rates into our model-based reconstruction of Marine20. Uncertainties in model parameters are propagated through the BICYCLE model by creating an ensemble of 500 simulations which are summarized by Monte-Carlo statistics. The new curve is seen to fit well with observed data for the pre-bomb period and agrees with individual simulations of a more complex model (LSG OGCM). For a calibration user, it is key to use the accompanying updated local-reservoir ∆R adjustments, found at http://calib.org/marine/, before using the new Marine20 curve.In this paper we have presented an overview of the construction of the Marine20 globalaverage marine radiocarbon age calibration curve from 0-55 cal kBP.

        <p>TJH led this study and performed the Bayesian modeling. The general setup of Marine20 has been designed through discussions of the IntCal Marine Focus group led by EB. PK provided simulation results using the BICYCLE model, MB simulation results from the LSG OGCM. The manuscript has been written by TJH with large contributions from PK. RWR performed initial modeling tests incorporating pCO 2 data and recalculated ∆R values in the marine reservoir correction database with Marine20. All other co-authors provided expert knowledge and contributions to both discussions and the writing of the manuscript.TJH led this study and performed the Bayesian modeling.
