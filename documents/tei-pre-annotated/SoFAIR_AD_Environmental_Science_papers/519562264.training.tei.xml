        <p>Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) will play a critical role in future decarbonisation efforts to meet the Paris Agreement targets and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Whilst there are many well developed CCUS technologies there is the potential for improvement that can encourage CCUS deployment. A time and cost-efficient way of advancing CCUS is through the application of machine learning (ML). ML is a collective term for high-level statistical tools and algorithms that can be used to classify, predict, optimise, and cluster data. Within this review we address the main steps of the CCUS value chain (CO 2 capture, transport, utilisation, storage) and explore how ML is playing a leading role in expanding the knowledge across all fields of CCUS. We finish with a set of recommendations for further work and research that will develop the role that ML plays in CCUS and enable greater deployment of the technologies.Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) will play a critical role in future decarbonisation efforts to meet the Paris Agreement targets and mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

        <p>As atmospheric CO 2 concentrations surpass yet another milestone (4420 ppm in April 2021 1 ), climate change continues to be described as the biggest threat to humanity and global security. 2 It is for this reason that global efforts to decarbonise all sectors of society through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) have begun to be strengthened and provides the backdrop for the COP26 discussions. 3 The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity to foresee a 'new normal' where lifestyles can be radically different, and a sense of national contribution can be understood.As atmospheric CO 2 concentrations surpass yet another milestone (4420 ppm in April 2021 1 ), climate change continues to be described as the biggest threat to humanity and global security. 2 It is for this reason that global efforts to decarbonise all sectors of society through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) have begun to be strengthened and provides the backdrop for the COP26 discussions. 3 The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity to foresee a 'new normal' where lifestyles can be radically different, and a sense of national contribution can be understood.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to governments around the world utilising this change as an opportunity to ''Build Back Better'' with ''Green Growth'' and a ''Green Industrial Revolution''. [4][5][6][7][8] Part of these recovery plans involve the deployment of CCUS at significant scales in the coming decades to meet net zero pledges and limit warming to 1.5 1C. CCUS is absolutely crucial for the decarbonisation of many sectors that cannot be decarbonised by other process changes (e.g., cement, iron and steel). The roll out of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is planned to achieve 10 Mt CO 2 captured per year by 2030 in the UK, with other similar commitments globally. 9 In addition, all negative emissions technologies (NET), such as direct air capture (DAC) and Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technologies require the deployment of CCUS. These technologies allow otherwise stranded fossil fuel in the power sector to continue to be used at a much higher level and reduces the abatement requirements of fossil fuels (including natural gas) to a 28-33% level, instead of a 46-57% level while staying below a 2 1C temperature target. 10 Moreover, there is also a growing awareness in the EU and countries like Canada that meeting net zero emissions by 2050 11 and 2060 for China, 12 unconventional methods such as DAC will be required. 13 A similar view is developing in the USA, that negative emissions technologies are required to meet current climate goals by 2050 and without them, the US net zero initiative will fail. 14 Moreover, the idea that a 100% wind, water and solar scenarios are even achievable by 2050 has also received challenges. 15 In light of this, more affordable CCUS, is not just desirable, but also essential. However, a general review of CCUS technology and its roll out is available from others, so the authors will not go into details, explaining the basic mechanics of CCUS processes. 16 The use of machine learning (ML) has increased for a multitude of applications due to the growth in computing power in recent years, this is true for CCUS applications as well. ML offers the potential to identify links between data/ results that aren't readily identifiable, and it also provides alternative lower computing cost pathways. Within the field of CCUS, ML has begun to be utilised to evaluate new CO 2 sorbents and oxygen carrier materials, 17 simulate, control and operate capture processes, [18][19][20][21][22][23] simplify process economics, predict CO 2 solubilities in solvents and CO 2 capture capacities in adsorbents, [24][25][26] improve the accuracy of multiphase flowmeters used for CO 2 pipelines, 27 and predict leaks from CO 2 wells; 28 each with the aim of advancing the field of CCUS in a cost and time effective manner. Meanwhile, it is also worth noting that ML is data-driven technology, and its performance usually depends on the size and quality of database. In some areas of CCUS, the available data size can be limited to only a few dozens of datapoints and some of the raw data may not even be published openly, which will limit researchers in applying ML in those areas. Moreover, ML is a powerful tool for complex and nonlinear problems. It may not be suitable for applications that can be easily solved by numerical methods. Another big challenge for ML is it is difficult to extract the new knowledge from ML models to form general conclusions and scientific laws. Researchers in CCUS should consider what new information they can extract from ML models before applying ML in their research. Nevertheless, ML in CCUS is still relatively new and there is much yet to be studied.Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to governments around the world utilising this change as an opportunity to ''Build Back Better'' with ''Green Growth'' and a ''Green Industrial Revolution''.

        <p>Past studies in ML in CCUS are scattered within the literature and there has been no previous attempt to reconcile this information, gathered along the entire CO 2 supply chain, systemically into a critical review and summary and set out a clear pathway forward. A detailed and systematic critical analysis of previous research will lead to an acceleration of CCUS commercialisation and an expansion of ML in all areas of CCUS, this forms the main motivation behind this review.Past studies in ML in CCUS are scattered within the literature and there has been no previous attempt to reconcile this information, gathered along the entire CO 2 supply chain, systemically into a critical review and summary and set out a clear pathway forward.

        <p>ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience. 29,30 Its advantages include ease of trends and pattern identification, minimal human intervention (automation), ability to improve continuously, as well as high efficiency in the handling of multi-dimensional and multi-variety data. 29,31 Its application is however sometimes limited by factors such as ethics, lack of physical constraint, data availability and quality, misapplication as well as interpretability. 32 The dependence of ML modelling on data presents some challenges in terms of availability, quantity as well as quality. Given this dependence, if the sourced data contains human biases and prejudices, then the decision of models developed from such data may inherit such biases, consequently leading to unfair and wrong decisions. Closely associated with the aspect of data is the challenge of dimensionality (the curse of dimensionality). This refers to all the problems that arise when working with data in higher dimensions (large number of data features) that did not exist in lower dimensions. 33 This leads to overfitting resulting in poor performance of the model. In order to avoid this, dimensionality reduction, which is the transformation of high-dimensional data into a meaningful representation of reduced dimensionality is carried out. 34 This data preprocessing improves the performance of the data, reduces training time and computational resources as well as noise removal. 35 Dimensionality reduction methods include: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS),

            <rs type="software">Mapping</rs> (
            <rs type="software">Isomap</rs>), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) and auto-encoders. 33,34 ML model interpretation is another major challenge of deploying ML. This is as a result of the black-box nature of many ML models in which humans are unable to explain the decision-making logic of the ML model despite obtaining high predictive accuracy. This crucial weakness impacts not only on ethics but also on accountability, trust, transparency, safety and industrial liability. 36 To address this limitation and given the importance of openness in scientific research, several approaches have been reported with some even deployed at the cost of sacrificing accuracy. Some of these methods and techniques include; decision tree, feature importance, sensitivity analysis, partial dependence plots, activation maximization, explainable neural network (XNN), local interpretable modelagnostic explanation (LIME), shapley additive exPlanations (SHAP), Deep Learning Important FeaTures (DeepLIFT) explanation method and Treeinterpreter. 36,37 Key factors to consider in building interpretable ML models have also been reported to include but not be limited to the degree of white-box modelling, data visualisation, usability, model visualisation, variable importance, accuracy, fairness, and sensitivity residuality. 36,38 In the application of ML to CCUS, it is recommended to aim for the use and development of interpretable models with competitive levels of predictive accuracy.

        <p>Fig. 1 presents the types of ML and respective areas of application. There are three main types of ML: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The supervised ML, which is the most commonly used of the three is usually applied when the input-output data is known. It involves training the ML models to learn the relationshi pb e t w e e nt h eg i v e ni n p u t sa n d associated output values. 39 If the available dataset consists of only input values (no labels), unsupervised ML can be used in an attempt to identify trends, structure, patterns or clustering in the input data. 40 Reinforcement learning is a ML technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its actions and experiences. 41 The execution of any of the types of ML can be done through the application of the appropriate algorithm.

        <p>3.1.1 Process simulation and optimisation 3.1.1.1 Background and challenges of mathematical and optimisation models. Due to the complex governing phenomena in absorption (especially chemical absorption, which includes mass transfer and chemical reactions) modelling and simulation of solvent-based carbon capture is a time consuming and intensive job. Two common approaches to model CO 2 absorption process are equilibrium-stage model and non-equilibrium stage models. The set of equations that describe the equilibriumstage model for the separation processes are termed the MESH equations (i.e., the mass balance equations, equilibrium relations, summation relations and the enthalpy equations). In the case of non-equilibrium stage models, the separation processes are d e s c r i b e db yt h eM E R Qe q u a t i o n s( i.e., the material balance equations, energy balance equations, rate (transfer rate) equations and the equilibrium relations). 44 In addition to MESH and MERQ equations, numerous parameters related to physical properties and transport properties such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, diffusivity coefficient, and mass and heat transfer coefficients must be considered in the model. The mass and heat balances must be considered for both liquid and gas phases and complex mathematic methods must be applied to solve the obtained set of algebraic and differential equations.3.1.1 Process simulation and optimisation 3.1.1.1 Background and challenges of mathematical and optimisation models.

        <p>As many of the models used to predict the physical properties are experimental based models, there is considerable error and deviation in the prediction of different parameters that directly affect the results of the process model. 45 It should be noted that in the case of dynamic simulation which contains partial differential equations (PDE), the initial points to solve the problem is a critical aspect of the modelling job. Finding these can be a very tedious and time-consuming process. Regression and classification This algorithm is based on the Bayes' theorem which updates the prior knowledge of an event with the independent probability of each feature that can affect the event Despitealltheseabove-mentioned weaknesses and drawbacks, applying ML to model and optimise the solvent-based carbon capture is attracting increasing attention. Methods like ANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system or adaptive networkbased fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), radial basis function (RBF), and genetic programming (GP) can examine complex interaction between inputs to the model and predict the target (usually CO 2 capture levels and rate of absorption of CO 2 ). It should be noted that as experimental process data acquisition is frequently inadequate for various types of solvents, the majority of the researchers first developed a first principle mathematical model in a process simulator (such as Aspen Plus s ,AspenHYSYS s ,andgPROMS s ) and collected the data from that model. Then the collected data are used to develop the ML-based model. The ML-based models can predict the required targets with acceptable accuracy and be used easily for future studies. 46,47 3.1.1.2 Review of the ML-based process modelling and optimisation studies. Sipo ¨cz et al. 46 used a multilayer feed-forward neural network to capture and model the non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs of the solvent-based CO 2 capture process. The data used for training and validation of the ANN were obtained using the process simulator 
            <rs type="software">CO2SIM</rs>. The trained model was then used for finding the optimum operation for the example plant with respect to the lowest possible specific steam duty and maximum CO 2 capture rate. The authors reported that the average value of the errors for the prediction of specific reboiler duty was less than 0.2% and the maximum error was 3.1%. The prediction of solvent rich loading and amount CO 2 captured had a maximum error lower than 2.8% and 0.17% respectively.

        <p>The structure of the algorithm in this study is presented in Fig. 2. The first step of the algorithm is the determination of the appropriate sample size to construct the ANN, the second step is optimization by using the constructed ANN with the sample size obtained from the first step as the objective function. The results showed that the number of simulations, the minimum CO 2 capture cost, and the percent error, for both methods were close to each other.

In addition, an equation of state (EOS) such as Peng-Robinson, SAFT, and Soave-Redlich-Kwong is necessary. Furthermore, an activity coefficient-based model for instance Electrolyte NRTL, Wilson, and Extended UNIQUAC is also required to do the VLE calculations. The programming and implementation of these thermodynamic models, EOS and activity coefficients models is a complex and time-consuming job. 44 3.1.2.2 Review of the ML-based thermodynamic modelling studies. As mentioned, thermodynamic modelling and calculation of solvent-based carbon capture is a tedious task. There are many studies in recent years where researchers used ML methods to perform thermodynamic analysis of CO 2 capture in different types of solvents and these will be discussed below.3.1.2 Thermodynamic analysis 3.1.2.1 Background of mathematical thermodynamic analysis.

Furthermore, an activity coefficient-based model for instance Electrolyte NRTL, Wilson, and Extended UNIQUAC is also required to do the VLE calculations. The programming and implementation of these thermodynamic models, EOS and activity coefficients models is a complex and time-consuming job. 44 3.1.2.2 Review of the ML-based thermodynamic modelling studies. As mentioned, thermodynamic modelling and calculation of solvent-based carbon capture is a tedious task. There are many studies in recent years where researchers used ML methods to perform thermodynamic analysis of CO 2 capture in different types of solvents and these will be discussed below.</p>
        <p>Baghban et al. 53 compared the predictive capability of four ML models to evaluate the CO 2 solubility in 67 ionic liquids (ILs). They used the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM), ANFIS, Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), and Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBF-ANN). The solubility is considered as a function of different parameters such as operational temperature, pressure accompanied with the properties of ILs including the critical temperature, critical pressure and, acentric factor (o).

        <p>In the case of empirical and semi-empirical models, parameters/ descriptors that are used to obtain the model are very important and their selection is a crucial task.

Some examples of these data are experimental values reported in the literature, or famous databases like Design Institute for Physical Properties (DIPPR), 64 NIST, 65 and DETHERM. 66 Poling et al. 67 notes there is a relation between molecular structure and the bonds between atoms and their macroscopic properties. This concept proposes that a macroscopic property could be estimated using group contribution (GC) models. GC models include a wide range of models such as activitycoefficientGCmodelslikeUNIFACtoEOSGCmodelslike SAFT. 68 Quantitative-structure property/activity relationship (QSPR/ QSAR) is a modelling method to predict different physical and thermodynamic properties using the knowledge about the chemical structure of the molecules. 69 These physio-chemical structure and properties are known as descriptors and provide the basis for mathematically linking and explaining a molecules/materials activity or property. A large family of models have been developed to predict the properties for solvent-based CO 70 developed ANN QSPR model to predict the solubility of CO 2 and N 2 in common polymers. The authors used genetic function approximation (GFA) to find the best descriptors between 1600 molecular descriptors. They found out that molecular weights of gas and monomer, spectral moment 07 from edge adj. matrix weighted by edge degrees, mean atomic Sanderson electronegativity (scaled on Carbon atom), mean atomic polarizability (scaled on Carbon atom) can predict the solubility of CO 2 and N 2 in common polymers. Venkatraman and Alsberg 71 extracted over 10 000 IL-CO 2 solubility data for 185 ILs measured at different operating temperatures and pressures from the literature. The authors used a single decision tree, PLSR, and the non-linear ensemble random forest models. They also considered the COSMO-RS model and predicted the results of regression models with this quantum mechanical based thermodynamic model. They reported that temperature and pressure and parameters relevant to intermolecular interactions were selected as descriptors of the models. In this regard, a number of HOMO, LUMO energybased descriptors such as the HLFRACTION (ratio of the HOMO/LUMO energies), softness (inverse of the HOMO-LUMO gap) is indicative of the cation-anion electrostatic (nucleophilic-electrophilic) interactions that are key to the CO 2 solvation abilities to be selected. Other descriptors focus on important geometrical parameters such as the ovality or its inverse, the globularity factor that reflects the ability of the molecule to adapt its shape with respect to the approaching reactant. Kuenemann and Fourches 72 collected and compiled experimental absorption properties for more than 40 unique amines, and developed several QSPR models demonstrating the influence of structural modifications for amines' absorption properties. The authors used different MLs techniques namely ensemble tree, partial least squares regression, random forest, and ANN. They reported that the Random Forest and ANN models gave the best results. The authors also mentioned that they considered two types of descriptors in their study namely RDKit descriptors and Functional Connectivity Fingerprints (FCFP). A total of 117 RDKit and 1024 FCFP6 descriptors were computed. After pre-treatment of data, their dataset of amines reduces to 67 RDKit descriptors and 140 FCFP6 fingerprints descriptors. Zhang et al. 73 used ANN to predict CO 2 solubility in the solutions of potassium lysinate (PL) and its blended solutions with MEA, with a total of 433 data groups extracted from the literature. They use two different methods namely BPNN and general regression neural network (GRNN). The authors also predicted the aqueous solution density and viscosity using the same method. Afkhamipour et al. 74 selected concentration, temperature, molecular weight and CO 2 loading of the amine as the inputs (descriptors) to the ANN model to predict the heat capacity (C P ). Here, 3947 experimental data points representing heat capacity for 47 systems of amine-based solvents with a broad range of concentration and temperature were collected from published papers. The AARD% between model results and experimental data of C P for amine-based solvents was 4.3%. The obtained results from the ANN and thermodynamic models showed that the models could accurately predict the C P of conventional amines with an AARD% of 0.59%, and 0.57%, respectively. Cao et al. 75 modelled the toxicity of ILs towards a leukaemia rat cell line (ICP-81) using QSPR method. The authors considered the structures of 57 cations and 21 anions that were optimised using quantum chemistry. The ML methods used in this study were extreme learning machine (ELM), MLR and SVM. The results show that the ELM method had the best statistical parameters. In the aspect of used descriptors in their model, Ss-C-0.016 stands for the charge distribution area of the cation. SEP-A-69.25 and SEP-A-128.75 belong to the electrostatic potential surface area of anions. The other selected descriptors in their model are related to the electrostatic potential surface area of cations. The authors emphasised that the parameters for the electrostatic potential surface area are important and effective descriptors for predicting the toxicity of ILs. Borhani et al. 76 used GA-MLR method to develop a model to predict the partial pressure of CO 2 , the heat of absorption, and K-values for CO 2 absorption in 30, 45, and 60 wt% MEA aqueous solutions. The GA was used for the selection of the best parameters (feature selection) and functional form, by optimising with respect to the RQK fitness function.

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), RF and MLR were used to develop the models to predict Henry's law constant. The results of the modelling showed good statistical parameters for all three models for the test set. The correlation coefficient mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE for the MLP model were 0.98, 0.4818 and 0.65 respectively. The authors considered temperature, CO 2 partial pressure and water wt% as input of the model (descriptors) which all of them have physical meaning here. Two important methods can be used to screen the solvents to absorb the CO 2 -application of chemometric models (QSPR, GC,...) and computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). 79 Since ML is utilised in both these types of methods, it can therefore be said that the models developed using ML and described in Section 3.1.3 can be used to screen and select the best solvents.The results showed that the least accurate model was SVM with an AARD% of 15.13.

ML has been used to perform solvent screening for different applications. 80,81 Some studies related to solvent screening for CO 2 absorption have been done using the COSMO-RS thermodynamic model. 82,83 However, it should be noted that the number of studies related to the application of ML in the solvent selection and design for CO 2 absorption is considerably less than the application of ML in other types of studies related to CO 2 absorption, which are reviewed in previous sections. As ML is used to select and screen solvents for different applications, 81 it is promising to use it for CO 2 absorption solvents as well. Venkatraman et al. 84 have employed a multi-property, high-throughput pipeline to facilitate task-specific IL discovery. In Fig. 3, one of the main steps is the application of ML. ML models (RF, cubist and gradient boosted regression (GBR) were developed using experimental data for 10 different IL properties of interest.

        <p>3.1.5 Perspectives and prospects. In comparison to the first principle models developed for different studies on CO 2 absorption, the ML models are more accurate as they provide a complex and non-linear relationship between the inputs and predict the targets. As noted in this section, many ML-based models are developed for different applications of CO 2 absorption. However, the models that were developed for the prediction of physical and thermodynamic properties were not applied in any process modelling study. An important future goal is to integrate 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> or Python or other similar ML programmes to Aspen 
            <rs type="software">Plus</rs> s or gPROMS s or similar simulators to use these MLbased models in first principle process modelling studies. As ML-based models are more accurate than the traditional models, they can result in better predictions and results in thermodynamic and process modelling studies. Hence, the connection of these models to process simulators should be considered in future studies.

        <p>Adsorbent discovery and screening for CO 2 capture using supervised ML models have been extensively reported in the literature. 99 There have been many instances in the literature where the adsorbent properties are also tuned for specific applications. Collins et al. 115 showed that a genetic algorithm could efficiently optimise for desired physical or functional property in MOFs by evolving the functional groups within the pores. The authors optimised the CO 2 uptake capacity of 141 experimentally characterised MOFs under post-combustion CO 2 capture conditions and were able to increase the CO 2 adsorption on MOF MIL-47 by 400%. ML models have also been used to identify novel adsorbent properties such as hydrophobic adsorbaphore. This could be a very interesting phenomenon to exploit since the presence of moisture always hindered adsorptive CO 2 capture. Boyd et al. 116 screened an adsorbent library of E300 000 structures to identify adsorbents with this adsorbaphore property and demonstrated a synthesis pathway for two such adsorbents. These demonstrations of ML in the discovery, synthesis and exploration of the adsorbent design space show the possible pathways for identifying and implementing an effective adsorbent-based CO 2 capture process. 116 ML techniques have also been applied to speed up the characterization of the adsorbents. The Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) is generally used to predict the adsorption, and Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) are used to describe diffusion and other transport properties. 117,118 These techniques have been used to generate adsorbent property data for large databases of adsorbents at enormous computational costs. 105,119 To tackle this problem, researchers have applied supervised ML techniques to build predictive data-driven models. Extensive work has been carried out by computational materials chemists to identify the underlying QSPR using ML. 120 There are four general classes of descriptors that are generally used to describe the adsorption equilibria, geometric, topological, chemical and energy-based. 121 Dureckova et al. 122 developed ML models to predict CO 2 working capacity and CO 2 /H 2 selectivity using a diverse set of MOF structures using gradient boosted trees regression method. The authors also showed that both geometric descriptors, such as surface area, and chemical descriptors, constructed using atomic property weighted radial distribution functions, can be used to predict with reasonable accuracy the working capacity and mixture gas selectivity. 122 Burner et al. 123 presented a similar framework to predict the working capacity and CO 2 /N 2 selectivity using a deep neural network (DNN). The best predictions were obtained with the AP-RDF, chemical motif, and geometric descriptors, all as inputs, with an R adj 2 4 0.95. Pardakhti et al. 124 reported that a framework for the prediction of methane uptakes using ML algorithms. They evaluated multiple ML algorithms, such as SVR and RF, and reported a high prediction accuracy compared to the GCMC predictions. 124 Bucior et al. 125 presented a datadriven surrogate trained ML model to predict H 2 loading on MOFs using a new type of descriptors as model inputs. The descriptors were derived using the binned histograms of the energies of adsorbent-adsorbate interaction and used as inputs to the predictive model. The sparse regression model trained with this and geometric descriptors to predict gas uptake in multiple MOF databases to a high degree of accuracy. 125 These studies show us that both the adsorbent structure and the chemical interactions are needed to be taken into account for accuracy in predictions. ML frameworks have been successfully shown to speed up single adsorbent-adsorbate interactions. Still, their real application is in the prediction of multiple gases and mixture gas adsorption on adsorbents. Techniques such as transfer learning, dimension reduction, feature identification can improve the model predictions for such cases. 126 Anderson et al. 127 presented a new framework to predict the adsorption of multiple adsorbate gases for a given range of conditions using a MLP. The model was trained using the variables that describe the force-field parameters of ''alchemical'' species and the MOFs as simple descriptors such as geometric and chemical moieties. The resulting models could then predict the adsorption of six different gases in a diverse set of adsorbents. 127 While understanding the separation potential of an adsorbent is critical, quantification of the mechanical stability and synthesizability of the in silico predicted adsorbent structures is an important aspect for the final deployment of the technology.Adsorbent discovery and screening for CO 2 capture using supervised ML models have been extensively reported in the literature. 99 There have been many instances in the literature where the adsorbent properties are also tuned for specific applications. Collins et al. 115 showed that a genetic algorithm could efficiently optimise for desired physical or functional property in MOFs by evolving the functional groups within the pores. The authors optimised the CO 2 uptake capacity of 141 experimentally characterised MOFs under post-combustion CO 2 capture conditions and were able to increase the CO 2 adsorption on MOF MIL-47 by 400%.

        <p>To tackle problems mentioned above, ML techniques have been applied to design and optimise cyclic adsorption processes for CO 2 capture applications. The studies employing ML to model and optimise cyclic adsorption processes can be classified into three categories. The first category corresponds to studies that used ML for supervised learning (regression) to know the structural mapping between the decision variables and process outputs in the process optimisation in order to avoid the computational burdens of running high-fidelity simulations for functional evaluations. To this end, an initial design of experiments (DOE) is performed on the decision variables that typically cover the entire design space. The high-fidelity models are then used to calculate the desired process outputs (typically key performance indicators used in the optimisation) based on the sample set of decision variables from the DOE. Finally, surrogate models using ML algorithms are constructed based on those samples and subsequently used in the optimisation. Single or multiple surrogate models can be constructed for process outputs. For example, Pai et al. 129 tested the ability of a variety of surrogate models constructed based on different supervised ML algorithms to predict the performance indicators of a 4-step VSA process for post-combustion CO 2 capture. Algorithms such as decision trees, RFs, SVMs, GPR and ANNs were trained for each performance indicator using a sample set of operating conditions generated via Latin hypercube sampling. Among these, GPR was shown to perform well using an adjusted coefficient of determination (greater than 0.98) as the metric. Upon employing these surrogate models in the process optimisation, they showed that the relative error of the optimal performance indicators from the surrogate and high-fidelity simulations was within 3%. Subraveti et al. 130 developed a neural network-based optimisation approach to determine the Pareto solutions of multi-objective maximisation of CO 2 purity and CO 2 recovery for a complex 8-step PSA process designed for pre-combustion CO 2 capture. Herein, the multiobjective NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm version II) algorithm's initial generations were carried out using high-fidelity simulations for evaluating objectives. This also served as the training data generation step for the neural network models, which learned the underlying input-output mapping structures between decision variables and objectives, CO 2 purity -CO 2 recovery. Such training data that was already biased towards the optimal region of the decision variable space helps improve the prediction accuracy of the neural network models in the desired optimal region. A three-layer feed-forward neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer with ten neurons and one output layer were used for each objective to demonstrate this approach, with results indicating that the relative error in both the objectives was found to be around 1%. The PSA optimisation using neural networks was ten times faster as compared to using high-fidelity simulations for functional evaluations. Instead of constructing a surrogate model for each performance indicator, Xiao et al. 131 used a multi-output feedforward neural network architecture to predict purity, recovery and productivity in the PSA optimisations. Vo et al. 132 formulated an integrated process model based on the combination of different feed-forward neural networks, which represent the input-output mapping structure of cryogenic, membrane and PSA units for hydrogen recovery and CO 2 capture from the tail gas of SMR-based hydrogen plants. The neural network models for each unit were shown to have less than 2% error and were subsequently used to minimise the production cost of the integrated process. The neural network models were also shown to have low computational costs.To tackle problems mentioned above, ML techniques have been applied to design and optimise cyclic adsorption processes for CO 2 capture applications.

        <p>Uncertainties in model predictions even lead to potentially different optimal solutions. To address the issue of uncertainties in ML-based optimisations, Hu ¨llen et al. 133 proposed three different strategies, i.e., robust optimisation, stochastic programming and discrepancy modelling, integrated with ML models for handling uncertainty. These approaches have been applied to a case of temperature swing adsorption process for DAC where the productivity of the process was maximised subject to purity, recovery and energy constraints. Sparse Grid polynomials and ANNs were used as data-based models to approximate decision variable-processes output mapping. The authors stress the importance of incorporating uncertainty into ML-based optimisations.Uncertainties in model predictions even lead to potentially different optimal solutions.

        <p>The second category of studies involves developing supervised ML models to predict the axial or temporal profiles of the cyclic adsorption process. Pai et al. 129 also developed neural network models to predict the bed profiles of the intensive variables of a 4-step VSA process at CSS. Using these neural networks, they demonstrated a rapid convergence to CSS. Further, the neural network predictions were also matched with the experiments. Leperi et al. 134 used neural networks to construct basic steps in typical PSA processes for postcombustion CO 2 capture. For each step, twelve neural network models were constructed. To elaborate, each neural network model for predicting five state variables (absolute pressure, CO 2 gas phase mole fraction, CO 2 molar loading, N 2 molar loading and column temperature) were measured at ten measured locations along the column. Further, one neural network at each end of the column predicts the total gas flowing in and out of the column. This approach allowed them to synthesise different PSA cycles for post-combustion CO 2 capture and calculate their performances based on the neural network models underpinning each step. Oliveira et al. 135 proposed a real-time soft sensor for a PSA unit based on deep learning networks. Three different types of ANNs, namely, feed-forward, recurrent and long short-term memory (LSTM) models based on multi-input and a single output, were developed to predict the PSA model dynamics. It was shown that LSTM-based DNNs outperformed feed-forward and recurrent neural networks in terms of predicting the dynamics of PSA. The authors also suggested that the LSTM-based DNNs can be reliable for optimisation, control and on-line measurements of PSA units.The second category of studies involves developing supervised ML models to predict the axial or temporal profiles of the cyclic adsorption process.

        <p>In the third category, supervised ML algorithms such as PLSR were used for reducing the dimensionality of the cyclic adsorption process optimisation. For example, Subraveti et al. 130 employed PLSR to identify each decision variable's relative importance in the optimisation, which impacts the process objectives. The most relevant decision variables were identified using the PLS weights, and other variables are discarded. For the case study considered, the original eight decision variables were reduced to three using this approach.

        <p>ML-based techniques such as DNNs are well-suited for applications that require large amounts of repetitive computation. ANN-based surrogate models have been applied as cheap computational emulators of complex process models to aid in the fast screening of material. Khurana and Farooq 111 developed regression models to directly predict minimum energy and maximum productivity for CO 2 capture from a flue gas stream containing 15% CO 2 using a VSA process. Khurana and Farooq 111 also screened around 80 adsorbents using the ML model and validated the optimised results with a detailed mathematical model. Burns et al. 25 and Leperi et al. 110 also screened the CoRE MOF database to identify high-performance adsorbents for post-combustion CO 2 capture using a detailed model. Burns et al. 25 developed a decision tree-based ML model, and Leperi et al. 110 developed a generalised separation metric using the data from a detailed model to screen new adsorbents in the same process with a high degree of accuracy. These papers also showed the clear computational advantage of the application of ML-based surrogate models for screening due to their inherent speed and accuracy. Pai et al. 26 developed a generalised framework called machine-assisted adsorption process learner and emulator (
            <rs type="software">MAPLE</rs>) for modelling and screening any Langmuir (Type I) adsorption isotherm by including the isotherm parameters as model inputs along with the process parameters. The authors demonstrated that the framework accurately modelled process performance and were able to validate the ML-based optimisation framework from the external literature. The study showed the computation required to train the generalised ML model was similar to the computation required to screen rten adsorbents using the traditional modelling and optimisation approach. It should be noted that these ML models are robust only in the training data range. One must be careful not to overtrain and to thoroughly validate the performance with independently generated testing data.

In each of these cases, vast amounts of simulation experiments need to be carried out. Khurana and Farooq 111 developed an inverse design framework to predict the hypothetical best isotherm for post-combustion CO 2 capture in a VSA-based process. In this work, the authors considered five input parameters to describe the adsorption equilibria and trained a neural network model. The resulting optimisation of the idealised isotherms provided insight into the effect of the isotherm on the process performance. Pai et al. 137 used a ML surrogate,

Yao et al. 138 proposed an automated adsorbent discovery framework using an autoencoder to generate MOF structures with desired functions. The results showed that the model accurately captured structural features and was able to reconstruct MOF structures. The framework showed the automated design of MOFs for CO 2 capture from natural gas and flue gas streams. 138 These studies highlight the advantage of ML in synergistic processes and adsorbent. Due to their computational speed and accuracy, such ML models allow designers to explore previously computationally restrictive engineering problems.

        <p>Process modelling and optimization. The major barrier for exploring different adsorption process cycles for CO 2 capture has been the significant computational demands in process modelling and optimisation. Existing studies in the literature showed that supervised learning algorithms could be efficiently incorporated into the optimisation routines. With the advances in ML, more efforts must be directed towards the dynamic modelling of adsorption processes. For instance, Leperi et al. 134 used ANNs to model the dynamics of some basic constituent steps in PSA processes. Such approaches are useful, especially when designing and evaluating different adsorption processes for CO 2 capture. Increasing the generalisation capability of such ML models is also important for accurate predictions. These models can also gain more insights in understanding the interplay among different intensive variables such as gas composition, pressure, temperature, and solid compositions affecting the process. The high dimensionality of the adsorption process optimisations can be tackled using ML. Semi-supervised/unsupervised algorithms can be utilised to know the effect/causal relationships between the decision variables and the performance indicators. This will help understand the underlying relationships between process inputs-outputs and identify significant decision variables for the optimisation. While most ML studies are focused on the processes designed for the pilot-scale, some of these ML approaches can also be extended to industrial applications. For example, these models can be effectively used in the process monitoring and control to overcome inherent process control challenges, especially since several sequences of steps occur in cyclic adsorption processes. Reinforcement learning (RL) can also be applied to monitor and control the cyclic adsorption processes. RL algorithms can be trained to learn adaptability when the process is subjected to external disturbances.Process modelling and optimization.

This will help understand the underlying relationships between process inputs-outputs and identify significant decision variables for the optimisation. While most ML studies are focused on the processes designed for the pilot-scale, some of these ML approaches can also be extended to industrial applications. For example, these models can be effectively used in the process monitoring and control to overcome inherent process control challenges, especially since several sequences of steps occur in cyclic adsorption processes. Reinforcement learning (RL) can also be applied to monitor and control the cyclic adsorption processes. RL algorithms can be trained to learn adaptability when the process is subjected to external disturbances.</p>
        <p>Integrated material-process screening. For CO 2 capture, integrated material-process studies have recently become common. Given that a large number of materials have to be screened using the process for reliable material evaluations, conducting a multiscale computational campaign for integrated materialprocess performance evaluation is computationally very expensive. However, ML has transformed this potentially computationally impossible exercise into a possibility. For example, Pai et al. 26 developed a material agnostic ML framework where both material and process decision variables are considered for screening and evaluating the performance of different materials. Such approaches will enable a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns in the material feature space. Algorithms like manifold learning can be utilised to identify such patterns in the material feature space, which will help in accelerating the material discovery for CO 2 capture. Oxyfuel combustion burns fuels in a mixture of pure O 2 and recirculated CO 2 instead of air, and then the CO 2 can be easily separated from the flue gases. To reduce the energy penalty and costs from the air separation unit in the oxyfuel combustion process, the next generation of carbon capture technology, chemical-looping combustion (CLC), that can transfer the oxygen from the air reactor to the fuel reactor by means of oxygen carriers, has been proposed. The current technology readiness level (TRL) for oxy-fuel combustion and CLC is estimated at 7-8 and 6, respectively. The applications of ML in these technologies are mainly focused on predicting the thermodynamic characteristics of oxy-fuel combustion, monitoring the oxy-fuel combustion process, estimating the reactivity of oxygen carriers and process control of CLC.Integrated material-process screening.

        <p>The results indicated that BPNNs gave a better prediction than that of RBF neural networks. 141 Govindan et al. 142 used trained ANNs, using TGA to predict the sample mass loss percentage of oxy-fuel combustion of calcined pet coke, with the predictions obtained from the model showing a high degree of accuracy, with a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.99. Qiao and Zeng 143 also applied the ANN framework to predict the gas products of heavy oil gasification under oxy-fuel conditions but the authors have not clarified how they trained and validated their ANN models. Debiagi et al. 144 developed a reduced-order model based on ML, which can accurately predict different phases of coal particle combustion at a reduced computation cost. They used a High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) method to develop the supervised ML models (see Fig. 5). Unlike the case with the previous work, the training and test datasets were generated from an accurate, detailed solid fuel kinetic model that considered a wide range of operation conditions obtained from a novel gas-assisted coal combustor. 144 Krzywanski et al. 145 developed a generalised ANN model to predict the SO 2 emissions from large-and small-scale circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boilers under air-firing, oxygen-enriched and oxy-fired combustion conditions with the dimension and operating parameters of the CFB boilers as the inputs. The authors 145 also conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effects of changing operating parameters on the SO 2 emissions using the trained ANN models. The results indicated that the ANN model can serve as a fast tool to provide the accurate prediction of SO 2 emissions for coal combustion in the CFB boilers under the different combustion environments with less complexity and costs. 145 Besides predicting the useful parameters of oxy-fuel combustion, ML can also be applied to monitor air/oxy-fuel combustion processes for combustion control and optimisation under variable conditions. Bai et al. 146 proposed a novel method by combining flame imaging, principal component analysis and random weight network (PCA-RWN) techniques for multimode process monitoring for air and oxy-fuel combustion of coal (see Fig. 6). Flame image database collected from a 250 kW air/oxy-fuel combustion Test Facility were used to validate the PCA-RWN models and the performance was evaluated by the Hotelling's T 2 and squared prediction error (SPE). Compared to the performance of the proposed PCA-RWN model with other ML classifiers (Kernel Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbour classifier) for pattern recognition, the proposed PCA-RWN model gives the best prediction of the average recognition success rate and the least training time. 146 The authors 147 also followed a similar methodology to apply the PCA with kernel support vector machine (KSVM) model for the multimode monitoring of combustion stability under different oxy-gas fired conditions.

        <p>Chen et al. 153 proposed the use of BPNN to predict the performance of Ca-based sorbents in the calcination/carbonation cycles, based on TGA experimental data. This study observed the factors that affected the sorbent performance, namely sample particle diameter, calcination temperature, calcination duration, calcination atmosphere and carbonation duration. The feed-forward multilayer ANN, which had the architecture of 5-34-1, had the five aforementioned factors as inputs, and the carbonation conversion degree as the output parameter, calculated with the assumption that the decomposition of calcium carbonation was the only reason for sample weight change. Here, 75% of the data was used for training while the remaining 25% was accounted as the test data. The model proposed showed a strong correlation with TGA results and proved the validity for the approximation of Ca-based sorbent in the carbonation process even when conducted at extreme reaction condition.Chen et al. 153 proposed the use of BPNN to predict the performance of Ca-based sorbents in the calcination/carbonation cycles, based on TGA experimental data.

        <p>3.3.3 Perspectives and prospects. ML has been successfully applied in oxy-fuel combustion for the combustion characteristics prediction and process monitoring. It should be pointed out that most researchers use TGA data to train, validate and test the ML models to predict combustion characteristics, but these also can be easily measured by the TGA without using the training data to develop the optimal ML model that requires higher computing costs and longer time. In addition, the extracted TGA data cannot represent the combustion characteristics in the real combustor due to their low heating rates and mass-heat transfer considerations. Thus, it is suggested that the researchers could use the data from the pilot-scale or large-scale combustors to develop their ML models, and the trained ML models could provide more useful information to develop oxyfuel combustion technology.

        <p>In the Section 3, we have reviewed and discussed the research of applying ML in CO 2 capture, which includes CO 2 absorption, CO 2 adsorption, oxyfuel combustion, calcium looping and chemical looping combustion. There is also work on ML in membrane for CO 2 separation which is detailed elsewhere. [158][159][160] 4. Machine learning in CO 2 transportation, utilisation, and storage The captured CO 2 needs to be transported from the capture points to the storage sites. Pipeline transportation of CO 2 in the dense phase is regarded as the most cost-efficient and safest solution over a long distance. 161 Accurate flow metering of CO 2 in CCUS pipe networks is crucial to the optimised design and economical operation of CCUS processes. For instance, it is reported that each percent of accuracy improvement will save h200k per year for a CCUS project in Norway. 162 As expected, larger-scale CCUS systems, a higher number of accurate flowmeters need to be deployed. In addition, the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) requires the flowmeters to operate within an uncertainty of AE1.5%. 161 However, it is difficult for traditional flowmeters to meet the accuracy requirements due to the complex properties of CO 2 fluid. Unlike water, oil and natural gas, CO 2 is expected to be transported near the critical point, which is very close to the expected operational condition of transportation pipelines. A small change in line temperature and pressure may lead to a significant change in the phase of CO 2 , resulting in gas-liquid two-phase CO 2 flow. Impurities produced using different capture methods may also affect the phase behaviours of CO 2 flow. In addition, some impurities, such as water, H 2 S, NO and SO 2 , produce corrosive products which may influence the choice of Fig. 8 Application of the model for the evaluation of NO x concentration if flue gas. 155 Fig. 9 Structure of the artificial neural network used to map the thermodynamic performance of the calcium looping process retrofit. 156 flowmeter material. 163,164 For some volumetric flowmeters, the density data calculated from the equation of state (EoS) is required to obtain the mass flowrate. However, the accuracy of EoS of CO 2 flow with impurities is insufficient. 165 Moreover, flexible operations of CCUS systems on smart fossil fuel fired power plants, such as frequent load changes and rapid startups and shutdowns, may lead to rapid changes in the properties of CO 2 flow. Transient behaviours that occur in pipelines may result in the phase transition of CO 2 and flow instability, making the accurate measurement of CO 2 flowrate more challenging.In the Section 3, we have reviewed and discussed the research of applying ML in CO 2 capture, which includes CO 2 absorption, CO 2 adsorption, oxyfuel combustion, calcium looping and chemical looping combustion.

        <p>4.1.2 Measurement of the mass flowrate of two-phase CO 2 flow. Mass flowrate measurement of CO 2 flow is essential for the fiscal purpose in CCUS projects. Coriolis mass flowmeters, as the most accurate single-phase mass flowmeters, have the ability of directly measuring mass flowrate, but the errors in measuring two-phase flow are still large. Thus, ML algorithms are employed to improve the accuracy of Coriolis mass flowmeters in multiphase flow measurement, based entirely on internally observed parameters. Fig. 10 shows the common solution based on Coriolis mass flowmeter and ML algorithms. The ML algorithms use input variables reading from Coriolis flowmeters and give the measured mass flowrate, density, and gas volume fraction (GVF). When CO 2 flow is single-phase liquid or gas, the output of GVF is 0% and 100%, respectively.4.1.2 Measurement of the mass flowrate of two-phase CO 2 flow.

The same measurement system was also employed to measure slugging two-phase CO 2 flow at the pressure of 5.52-7.03 MPa and the temperature of 4-32 1C. 172 Results show that the reading difference between the Coriolis flowmeter and other sales meters over several weeks is usually within AE5%. Comparative investigations into the performance of ML algorithms for gas-water two-phase flow metering were conducted by Wang et al. 173 Several algorithms, such as ANNs, SVM and GP, were developed to estimate the liquid mass flowrate and GVF. The inputs of the ML algorithms were obtained from a Coriolis flowmeter and a differential pressure (DP) transducer. For the mass flowrate measurement, the input variables are apparent mass flowrate, apparent density, damping and DP, while for the GVF measurement, the apparent mass flowrate, density and DP are taken as inputs. Results show that the relative errors are within AE1% in mass flowrate measurement over the range of 250 to 3200 kg h À1 and within AE10% in GVF prediction. Wang et al. 170 also applied a Coriolis mass flowmeter incorporating LS-SVM models to measure the mass flowrate of gas-liquid two-phase CO 2 flow in both horizontal and vertical pipelines.

A classification model is developed and incorporated in the system to recognise the flow pattern and independent LS-SVM models for the mass flowrate metering of gas-liquid two-phase CO 2 flow. Results suggest that most of the relative errors under steadystate flow conditions are within AE2% in horizontal test pipeline and AE1.5% in vertical test pipeline.

Experimental results suggest that errors of the measured GVF are mostly within AE10%. Shao et al. 27 achieved the GVF measurement in a horizontal CO 2 pipeline based on a 12-electrode capacitive sensor and datadriven models, as shown in Fig. 12. Three data-driven models, BPNN, RBFNN and LS-SVM, were established. Unlike the flow pattern recognition approach, reconstructed images are usually not required for GVF measurement. The GVF measurement of two-phase CO 2 flow is achieved without the time-consuming image reconstruction of the flow pattern. Experiments were conducted under both steady-state and dynamic flow conditions. For steady-state flow conditions, the mass flowrate was set from 200 to 3100 kg h À1 while the GVF was from 0-84%. Under dynamic flow conditions the gas phase CO 2 was rapidly increased from 120 kg h À1 to 400 kg h À1 and then decreased while the liquid CO 2 was fixed at 1500 kg h À1 .

        <p>Methods that may be used to select variables. Input variable selection techniques can be classified into three main categories: wrapper, embedded and filter algorithms. Wrapper algorithms, such as Single Variable Regression and Genetic Algorithm-Artificial Neural Network (GA-ANN), and embedded algorithms, including Recursive Feature Elimination and Evolutionary ANNs, are model-based, i.e., a model has to be constructed and trained in advance. Filter algorithms such as Rank Correlation, Partial Correlation and Partial Mutual Information (PMI) are model-free.

The model-based approach aims to select the variable set which makes the model perform well through establishing and evaluating the model through potential variable combinations. The main drawback of this approach is the high computational requirement due to a large number of calibration and validation processes required. Moreover, the selection results depend on the predefined model in terms of architecture and parameters. By contrast, the model-free approach is directly based on the information (interclass distance, statistical dependence, or information theory, etc.) between the available dataset, so the computational efficiency is not an issue. However, a tradeoff criterion should be defined to balance the significance measurement and the number of selected variables.Methods that may be used to select variables.

        <p>The solubility of CO 2 in the oil phase is generally higher than that of brine in mature oil reservoirs. 191 Residual trapping involves the process that trapping CO 2 as an immobile phase within the porous media due to capillary forces. It is an important phenomenon in the CO 2 sequestration process especially when there are no reliable sealing formations or caprock. The gas hysteresis effect plays a vital role in the residual trapping. 198 The bypass of a wetting phase fluid will render the non-wetting phase immobile, thus leading to the entrapment of the nonwetting phase. The effect of residual trapping can be enhanced when the hysteresis effect is considered. Ampomah et al. 191 in a detailed numerical simulation study, pointed out that there would be an apparent increase in the predicted amount of CO 2 trapped as a residual phase after the gas hysteresis effect was implemented. The predicted residual trapped CO 2 surged from 1% to 14% after the hysteresis effect was considered. In the mineral trapping, CO 2 will react with formation mineralogy and be trapped in the precipitation or dissolution of extant or new carbonate minerals. Compared with other mechanisms, CO 2 reactions often take years to occur thus its impact on the transportation of the CO 2 plume would be observed on a longer time scale. When CO 2 is in contact with formation brine, aqueous species such as soluble CO 2 ,H C O 3 À ,C O 3 À are generated, and then reacted with formation minerals.

Compared with other mechanisms, CO 2 reactions often take years to occur thus its impact on the transportation of the CO 2 plume would be observed on a longer time scale. When CO 2 is in contact with formation brine, aqueous species such as soluble CO 2 ,H C O 3 À ,C O 3 À are generated, and then reacted with formation minerals. Some common reactions between CO 2 and formation mineralogy are summarised in Table 4.</p>
        <p>Several studies using ML-based methodologies have been performed regarding how those trapping mechanisms influence the dispersal and migration of the CO 2 plume. Sun et al. 188 studied the CO 2 trapping mechanisms in the Morrow B Sandstone in the Farnsworth Units. A neural network-based approach was used to match the reservoir model with historical data. The history matched model was then employed to evaluate the impacts of residual, structural-stratigraphic, solubility, and mineral trapping mechanisms on CO 2 sequestration and hydrocarbon production. The ML-based history match process was able to provide reliable pressure, fluid saturation and composition distributions that help the numerical model effectively investigate trapping mechanisms with a reduced computational overhead. The conclusion was that more CO 2 is dissolved in the oleic phase than the aqueous phase, which is due to the high salinity of the formation water. Moreover, mineral trapping plays a less significant role in the CO 2 sequestration process compared with other trapping mechanisms.Several studies using ML-based methodologies have been performed regarding how those trapping mechanisms influence the dispersal and migration of the CO 2 plume.

        <p>Ni and Benson 199 studied the effect of mesoscale heterogeneity on larger-scale multiphase fluid flow properties and trapping behaviours using a ML clustering method. The CO 2 saturation maps, the voxel-level porosity and the permeability maps were used as the inputs for the model. Each voxel was treated as one data point, and the time series properties at each voxel were treated as individual attributes (i.e.,C O 2 saturation time series). The CO 2 saturation and the porosity maps were obtained through CT image manipulation, and the voxel-level permeability map was obtained using the extended Krause's method. 199 This study tested two clustering methods and found that K-means clustering was more suitable for characterizing flow behaviours and hierarchical clustering was more desirable for identifying the capillary heterogeneity trapping behaviours. Five different sets of coreflooding data were used to examine the feasibility of the proposed approach. They concluded this method was able to assess how the mesoscale petrophysical properties influence capillary-dominated flow and residual trapping behaviours. Moreover, the differences in time series behaviours among the different clusters would be diminished in viscous-dominated flow regimes.Ni and Benson 199 studied the effect of mesoscale heterogeneity on larger-scale multiphase fluid flow properties and trapping behaviours using a ML clustering method.

        <p>Menad et al. 200 proposed to use MLP and RBFNN to predict the CO 2 solubility in brine at different temperatures, pressures and molalities of NaCl. Additionally, several evolutionary algorithms were employed to optimise the control parameters of the neural networks, namely the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, GA, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC). Combinations of those methods were compared to determine the best one. They found that RBFNN-ABC Table 4 Summary of some common reactions between CO 2 and formation mineralogy [188][189][190] Reactions 1C O 2(aq) +H 2 O=H + + HCO 3 would yield to the most accurate prediction in the tests among all combinations. Zhang et al. 201 proposed a work to model the CO 2 -brine IFT using extreme gradient boosting (
            <rs type="software">XGBoost</rs>) trees. The generated model was then employed to determine the optimal CO 2 sequestration depth in saline aquifers. The brines used to synthesise the database consider one or more of the following salts: NaCl, KCl, Na 2 SO 4 , MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 . Thus, the total molalities of the monovalent cations (Na + and K + ) and bivalent cations (Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ) were considered as two independent input variables. CH 4 or N 2 were two impurities accounted for in the CO 2 stream, so the mole fractions of these two impure components were categorised into other two individual input variables. Pressure and temperature were also utilised as the other two variables due to their important impacts on the CO 2brine IFT. After inconsistent data points were removed, a total of 2346 data points were used to train the IFT prediction model. The 
            <rs type="software">XGBoost</rs> trees model combined a cluster of classification and regression trees (CARTs) to fit the training data samples. The basic components contained in CART are a root node, a set of internal nodes, and a set of leaf nodes, which is depicted in Fig. 13.

        <p>The hyperparameters of the 
            <rs type="software">XGBoost</rs> trees were optimised using the K-fold cross-validation integrated with the exhaustive grid search approach. In the grid search approach, the search range of each parameter is divided into different grids and this approach will test the values of all grids to determine the best result. Based on the model, the permutation importance (PI) was employed to ascertain the importance of each input variable to the IFT. Results showed that pressure had the highest impact on IFT, followed by temperature, bivalent cation molality and monovalent cation molality, while the mole fractions of CH 4 or N 2 were the least important factors. The capacity of structural trapping CO 2 in aquifers varies with the CO 2 -brine IFT that would be affected with different temperatures and pressures. It was claimed that with the help of the generated model, reservoirs with different pressure and geothermal gradients can be used to study the capacity of structural trapping CO 2 . An increase in the maximal structural trapping capacities for shallower formations was observed when the pressure was higher and/or the geothermal gradient was lower.

        <p>CO 2 leakage detection. After the CO 2 is injected into the subsurface complex, it is necessary to use monitoring and verification approaches to ensure the safe and long-term storage of injected CO 2 . 202 The common method includes building a numerical model to simulate how the CO 2 plume moves in the underground structure and to predict the feasibility of the long-term storage of the sequestered CO 2 . 203 Direct or non-direct monitor data is always utilised in collaboration with numerical models to assess risk of CO 2 plume leaks from faults, legacy well, or fracture systems. 204 Wang et al. 205 studied how to interpret the CO 2 saturation using seismic and downhole monitoring data. This study used ML approaches to infer the CO 2 saturation at different depths from the combination of synthetic seismic data and monitored downhole pressure and total dissolved solids (TDS) information. The framework was built upon a candidate geologic carbon storage site near Kimberlina, CA, USA. A hypothetical well leakage was included in the numerical model, which was focused on simulating the three geological layers overlying the CO 2 storage reservoir. All three layers were aquifer layers with a sand fraction of approximately 0.8. There were 6000 numerical simulations implemented by varying the distributions for the permeability of the three geologic layers. Each simulation had a 20 years' prediction with a timestep of one year. At each time step, rock physics modelling was performed to estimate changes in seismic velocity due to the simulated CO 2 and brine leakage from the flow simulation outputs. Therefore, a total of 120 000 forward seismic velocity models were obtained from those 6000 simulations. Each velocity model was further used to generate synthetic shot gathers using 2D finite-difference acoustic wave modelling, along a sparse 2D seismic line with only five shots and 40 receivers. For each velocity model, five seismic features were calculated thus 1200 (= 6 Â 40 Â 5) seismic features could be used to train the prediction model. Besides the seismic features, measured downhole pressure and TDS at three depths were also included in the training inputs, leading to a total of 1206 involved in each input-output pair. The output was the category of CO 2 saturation at three depths that have been labelled as five different integers to discretize the range of CO 2 saturation from zero to very high level. The SVM with a linear kernel (linear SVM), support vector machine with a radial basis kernel (SVMr), DNN with two hidden layers and recurrent neural network (RNN) with a LSTM layer were used to train the CO 2 saturation prediction model respectively. The performance of the models was estimated using the Kappa statistic, meaning the prediction accuracy was calculated and ranked between 0 to 1, with 0 representing a random prediction and 1 standing for perfect prediction. It was concluded that compared with using seismic monitoring alone, adding downhole pressure and TDS measurements as input features could improve the accuracy of the CO 2 saturation inversion.CO 2 leakage detection.

        <p>Sinha et al. 28,183 demonstrated how to detect the CO 2 leakage using pressure data. The injection of CO 2 would cause pressure perturbation across the reservoir field. Harmonic pulse testing (HPT) is one approach to cause this kind of perturbation hence it can be used to differentiate CO 2 leakage. In a typical HPT job, the perturbation was induced by the harmonic injection of a fluid into the reservoir at the injection well, and the responses were recorded at the observation well. The pressure HPT can be used to differentiate the pressure response of a leak versus the non-leak in a field test. In a CCUS project across multiple depleted oil fields, many injection wells and abandoned wells could act as the path for CO 2 leakage, making the interpretation of the voluminous HPT data a challenging task for human brains. However, the ML techniques can be a good alternative. In this work, the author used different neural networks to build the anomaly detectors to interpret CO 2 leakage, including multi-layer neural network (MFNN), LSTM, convolutional, neural networks (CNN), and a combination of CNN and LSTM (CONV-LSTM). The actual measured pressure signal was compared with the predicted response for the non-leak situation, and then the error was calculated as an indicator of the CO 2 leakage (anomaly). The conclusion was that LSTM outperformed the others in the pressure anomaly detection tests and the proposed approach could provide early warnings to the CO 2 leakage in a CCUS project.Sinha et al. 28,183 demonstrated how to detect the CO 2 leakage using pressure data.

        <p>Zhong et al. 207 used a combined CNN and LSTM model, designated as ConvLSTM, to detect the CO 2 leakage in a CCUS project. The CNN model was used to handle the spatial features and the LSTM was used for temporal features. The spatial features considered porosity and permeability and the temporal features included the CO 2 injection rate and the bottomhole pressures of a production well and a leak well. The temporal features were transferred into 2D images and the pixel value at the injection well location was the injection rate and the pixel values at the production and monitor wells were corresponding bottomhole pressures. Thus, the total inputs for the ConvLSTM model were three 2D images including one image containing the injection rate and bottomhole pressure at the production well, and the other two are areal distributions of the porosity and permeability. The output from the model was the predicted bottomhole pressure at the monitoring well, which was compared with a real monitored pressure to determine whether there is an anomaly in the CO 2 injection. The database used to train the ConvLSTM model was from a pulse testing experiment where the CO 2 is injected cyclically with an injection duration of 90 minutes. The injected CO 2 was artificially produced at a constant production rate of 60 kg min À1 to mimic a CO 2 leakage at the production well. A detection function was defined to calculate the probability of the test data point being in a user-defined normal data range given a user-defined threshold. They also pointed out that insufficient datasets or existing noises in the raw data may lead to inaccurate prediction.Zhong et al. 207 used a combined CNN and LSTM model, designated as ConvLSTM, to detect the CO 2 leakage in a CCUS project.

        <p>Singh 208 introduced a workflow to monitor and detect CO 2 leakage from a reservoir using injection rates and bottomhole pressures. A deconvolution response was defined as the function of time-dependent well bottomhole pressure and injection rates to measure the fluid leakage, which could be simulated using MLR of all the wells present in the reservoir. The model training process followed a strategy that field history without any leakage was used to train and validate the model. Then the model prediction was the simulated scenarios where no leakage took place. The deviation between the predictions and real monitoring deconvolution responses was employed to determine the leakage. The capability of the proposed workflow was demonstrated by applying it to three case studies: (1) a naturally fractured tight reservoir with five injectors and four monitoring wells; (2) a reservoir with a barrier and the same well pattern as case 1; (3) a real deep offshore saline aquifer with thick shale layer above and below the reservoir. It was concluded that the proposed method was able to detect leakage of both incompressible and compressible fluids from a simple reservoir to a fully heterogeneous and structurally complex field. The author also pointed that this method could provide preliminary insights into the location of the leakage, but still required the help of expensive surveys (such as seismic, etc.) to identify the actual location of a leak and the severity of the leak.Singh 208 introduced a workflow to monitor and detect CO 2 leakage from a reservoir using injection rates and bottomhole pressures.

The SRM_W models were used to investigate the flooding front and simulate the changes in properties along with time in each grid block in the reservoir. The properties that were handled by SRM_G included pressure, phase saturation, or composition of reservoir fluid components at any desired time step. The SRM_Ws were used to deal with simulation related to well production data, such as oil rate, water rate and water oil ratio, etc. SRM_Ws could be used to estimate response of the reservoir at the well level (rate) to various reservoir parameters or operational constraints. An ANN model with one hidden layer was used to train the SRMs. The values of each property at each timestep were predicted using one trained SRM. For the SRM_G, a total of 60 neural networks were generated to predict the interested properties at each timestep (15 models per property). The integration of the SRM_Gs and SRM_Ws contained the following steps: at the initial timestep, SRM_Gs ran first and the calculated pressure, phase saturation, and CO 2 mole fraction for all grids were processed to obtain the well productivity index and tiering computations pertaining to gridbased and well-based systems. The information along with wellbased initial information was then fed to SRM_Ws to calculate water, oil and CO 2 production at each well and entire field at first timestep. This process then proceeded to next timestep and information of each grid was updated until final timestep was reached.

This study focused on assessing impacts of design parameters on both volumetric and economic utilisation efficiency factors. Factors considered included the injection rate, duration (and volume), soaking duration, economic rate limit, and injected gas composition. A fast economic efficiency indicator was also constructed using neural networks based on the prepared simulating data. It was concluded that N 2 was better than other gases for short-term (5 or 10 years) benefits. Amini et al. 225,226 used SRM_G to replace the numerical reservoir model of a field located in Otway Basin in Australia with a CO 2 sequestration pilot project. The SRM model was trained through neural networks that used well data, static data and dynamic data as training inputs. It was concluded that the developed SRM model could generate outputs of complex reservoir models with high accuracy in a short time.</p>
        <p>Amini and Mohaghegh 227 proposed work to develop proxy fluid flow model for the reservoir responses (pressure, saturation, and CO 2 mole fraction) undergoing a CO 2 sequestration process. The proposed approach was applied to a heterogeneous reservoir with 100 000 active grid blocks to verify its capability. During the reservoir simulation, properties at a certain grid block would depend on its interactions with the surrounding grids. For instance, the CO 2 movement and gas saturation at one grid would be affected by the pore volumes and degree of tightness of the grids in the vicinity of this grid. To account for this kind of dependence, tier systems were introduced to express the relationship between one specific grid to its surrounding grids. An ANN-based SRM model was generated using the data gathered from a CO 2 injection reservoir with one injector and one producer. Five different simulating scenarios were prepared by varying the CO 2 injection rates and cumulative injection volume. The training inputs included static data (grid location, grid top, porosity, permeability), calculated static data (distance to the injection well, distance to the sealing and non-sealing boundaries, user-defined parameters), well data (injection rate, cumulative injection) and the average porosities and permeabilities of the tier system; the training outputs were the dynamic data (pressure, gas saturation and CO 2 mole fraction at any timestep). An ANN model with one hidden layer was used to train the proxy. It was concluded that the computational speed was increased by about 20 times for this specific simulation case with an acceptable error margin.Amini and Mohaghegh 227 proposed work to develop proxy fluid flow model for the reservoir responses (pressure, saturation, and CO 2 mole fraction) undergoing a CO 2 sequestration process.

        <p>Besides boosting computational speed, another reason for the employment of ML techniques is to ease the complexity of solving a problem, figuring out the unclear input-output patterns and structures that exist in the obtained experimental/ simulated database. This mostly occurs when traditional methods fail to work properly due to missing information. As one of the critical parameters considered in the CO 2 flooding process, the precise prediction of minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of oil in the CO 2 -EOR process are widely studied. Sinha et al. 28 used ML techniques to predict MMP. The proposed method included using an analytical correlation that employed the SVM to tune the coefficients and a hybrid method that combined RF regression and generated correlation. A correlation was used to predict the MMP and linear SVM was used to tune the coefficients included in this correlation. It was reported the proposed correlation would work for spectrum of MMP from 6 to 34 MPa.Besides boosting computational speed, another reason for the employment of ML techniques is to ease the complexity of solving a problem, figuring out the unclear input-output patterns and structures that exist in the obtained experimental/ simulated database.

        <p>Energy &amp; Environmental Science Review integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were employed for the study. The ARIMA models updated their training data as function of time, thus a smaller time step will lead to more accurate predictions compared with real data. Moosavi et al. 229 tested the capability of four different hybrid-RBF networks in predicting oil recovery factor and oil rate in a foam-CO 2 flooding reservoir. The RBF network was combined with various evolutionary algorithms, namely particle swarm, imperialist competitive, genetic and teaching-learning based algorithm, to build the prediction model. These algorithms were employed to optimise the values for the weights and biases applied to the network nodes. It was claimed that teaching-learning-based optimization hybrid model (TLBO-RBF) achieved the greatest accuracy in predicting based on the datasets used in this study. Chen et al. 230 developed a work to characterise the CO 2 -EOR in residual oil zones (ROZ). ROZs are aquifers (or parts of aquifers) in which oil has migrated from source rock but is subsequently swept by the natural movement of aquifer waters over geologic time and remains at residual saturation. The main distinction between CO 2 storage in ROZs and conventional oil reservoir and brine was also assessed. Here, a ML models to predict potential of hydrocarbon production and CO 2 sequestration amount in ROZs were developed. Three ML models, namely Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), SVR and RF, were used and compared in terms of predictive capability in this work. It was concluded that when crude oil was present, more CO 2 would be dissolved in oil than brine water; while when there was no oil within the system, more gas would be trapped in the pore structure than be dissolved in the aquifer.Energy &amp; Environmental Science Review integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were employed for the study.

The ML model can be applied to generate proxy models as alternative to numerical model and reducing total computational time. Sun 231 employed a deep reinforcement learning method, namely the deep Q-learning (DQL) algorithm, to handle optimization of carbon storage reservoir management. The problem was treated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which was to model the intelligent agent's sequential interactions with an environment to obtain maximal returns. The key procedure of solving a MDP was to find the optimal value of the state-action function (Q-function) to have the best reward at each state without concerns about future states. 231 In DQL, the deep Q network (DQN) was used to approximate Q-function for quick investigation and response. Another target network was used to calculate the rewards at future states. To speed up the evaluation of a large number of system transitions by using DQL, a DL-based surrogate model was built up to accelerate the policy search process.

In the optimisation process, if the difference between two candidate optimal solutions was smaller than the estimated proxy errors using the error model, then the original numerical model would be invoked to determine the ''true value'' of the candidate optimal solutions. This method increased the accuracy of the optimisation and lowered the simulator calls.

The proposed method proves computationally efficient in dealing with the co-optimisation problem. Ampomah et al. 240 presented an optimisation under uncertainty workflow to ascertain optimum solution in the presence of geological heterogeneity. A neural network optimisation algorithm was utilised to optimise the multi-objective function both with and without geological uncertainty.

And reduced-order models (ROM) were developed for each component using different approaches, such as look up table (LUT), ANNs and PCEs, Polynomial Regression, RBFs, 188 or Response Surface techniques. The ROMs were mostly used to study concentration and pressure information within the reservoir, especially at the reservoir-seal interface during CO 2 injection and for up to 1000 years post-injection period. These pressures and saturations could then be used as input parameters of wellbore or seal leakage models to predict rates and volumes of leakage of CO 2 .

They also proposed a method to use physical well locations and well-towell connectivity as the input variables, which increased the prediction accuracy. The Fast-Marching Method (FMM) introduced by Sethian (1996) was used to calculate the propagation of the pressure front and could be expressed as eqn (2):
        </p>
        <p>where the a = k/+mc t is the diffusivity, and t is the diffusive time of flight in the Fourier domain. The diffusive time of flight can be computed given the location of a well to indicate the peak of pressure front to reach any point in the reservoir. It could be obtained by solving the Eikonal equation and used to represent the connectivity between any two points in the reservoir; a higher t means lower connectivity. The proposed approach was applied on five different scenarios to demonstrate its feasibility, including (i) a homogeneous waterflooding reservoir model with one injection well, (ii) a waterflooding reservoir with channels and two injection wells, (iii) an ensemble of 20 waterflooding reservoirs with two injection wells, (iv) a CO 2flooding heterogeneous reservoir with two injection wells, and (v) a CO 2 -flooding heterogeneous reservoir with spatially-varying initial fluid saturation and three injectors.

        <p>4.2.2.3 CO 2 -Enhanced coalbed methane. CO 2 -Enhanced coalbed methane (CO 2 -ECBM) takes the dual benefits of sequestering CO 2 in coal seams and displacing the coalbed methane to be produced. The injection of CO 2 in coal seams will induce significant changes in the physical and chemical properties of coal (such as pore structure, strength, elastic modulus, etc.), which in turn affects the CO 2 sequestration performance in coal seams. 244 There are few studies relate CO 2 -ECBM with ML techniques, but most of those studies apply ML techniques to predict properties of coal and gas, such as coal strength, 244 CO 2 /CH 4 adsorption isotherm, 245,246 crack initiation pressure of coal, 247 coal identification, 248 permeability, 249,250 methane production. 251 Yan et al. 244 proposed a hybrid artificial intelligence model integrating back propagation neural network (BPNN), GA and adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) to predict the unconfined compressive strength of coal according to coal rank, CO 2 interaction time, CO 2 interaction temperature and CO 2 saturation pressure. The adsorption behaviour of CO Injecting CO 2 into shale gas reservoirs is also known as one type of CCUS. When the pressure and temperature is high, CO 2 will have a higher adsorption capacity than methane, especially in the micropore volume fraction, thus enhance gas recovery. Researches regarding CO 2 sequestration and shale gas recovery with ML applications focus on the prediction of kerogen components and types, 252 methane/CO 2 adsorption capacity, [253][254][255][256] and process optimisation. 237 The types, molecular components, and structures of shale kerogen directly influence its adsorption and hydrocarbon generation. Kang et al. 9 proposed a method to combine ML with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra to predict the kerogen components and types in shale. NMR spectrum was used as the inputs since the kerogen molecule's carbon skeleton information was mainly concerned. 256 The 2D spectrum was firstly converted into a 1D matrix where the values representing the NMR spectrum's normalized values, and then was fed into fully connected neural networks (FCNNs). The outputs of the FCNNs were molecular structure labels corresponding to different NMR spectrums. They concluded this method gives excellent performance in the prediction of kerogen skeleton components and types. Meng et al. 253 utilised classical approaches and ML approaches in the forecasting of the methane adsorption in shale. Amar et al. 254 applied gene expression programming (GEP) and group method of data handling (GMDH) to predict methane adsorption in shale gas formations. The pressure, temperature, total organic carbon, and moisture were considered as input parameters, while gas content (expressed in SCF per ton) was the models' single output. Bemani et al. 255 estimated the adsorption capacity of CO 2 ,CH 4 and CO 2 /CH 4 mixture in shale through an ML-based approach. They utilised the LS-SVM to mimic the relationship between four inputs (pressure, temperature, gas composition and TOC) to the gas adsorption capacity. Wang et al. 256 utilised different ML algorithms to predict the adsorbed shale gas content using reservoir temperature, TOC, vitrinite reflectance, Langmuir pressure, and Langmuir volume. The methods used include MLR, SVM, RF and ANN. Almasov et al. 237 optimized the CO 2 Huff-N-Puff Process in a shale oil reservoir. The NPV was calculated using proxies trained through LS-SVR and GPR. The well control parameters were then optimized to have the optimal NPV. 4.2.2.4 Chemicals, fuels and building materials. CO 2 can be converted into valuable products (chemicals, 257 fuels 258 and building materials 259 ) through various physical, chemical or biological pathways. 260 One popular field is CO 2 electrochemical reduction to chemical feedstocks (such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, methane, ethanol and ethylene) that utilises both CO 2 and hydrogen from renewable energy, to achieve a circular economy. 261 Catalyst development is one of the key steps to realise selective, fast, and efficient reduction processes of CO 2 into valuable products. 262 The ML algorithms showed great advances in efficiently screening the huge number of catalysts for the CO 2 catalytic or electro-catalytic conversion. Ulissi et al. 263 proposed to use a neural-network-based surrogate model together with DFT calculations to enable exhaustive searches for active bimetallic facets and reveal active site motifs for CO 2 reduction. Recently, Zhong et al. 264 claimed that Cu-Al electrocatalysts can efficiently convert CO 2 to ethylene with the highest faradaic efficiency reported so far through ML and DFT calculations. A ML-augmented chemisorption model has also been proven to be an effective way for CO 2 electroreduction to valuable C 2 species. 265,266 Wu et al. 267 found that the computational time and prediction errors could be reduced significantly by employing an extreme GBR. Herein, 80 adsorbate-pair combinations were identified to simultaneously enhance CH 4 and C 2 production on copper after screening 289 combinations. Wan et al. 268 also proved that GBR model exhibited the best prediction performance to select the superior electrocatalysts for CO 2 reduction. Moreover, Chen et al. 269 developed a ML model based on an extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm and simple features, which can successfully and rapidly predict the Gibbs free energy change of CO adsorption of 1060 atomically dispersed metal-nonmetal co-doped graphene systems, and significantly decrease time and costs. The ML methods show a great potential in accelerating the catalyst development based on the existing experimental results. 270 Li et al. 271 evaluated five ML algorithms ( S V M ,K N N ,D T ,S G Da n dA N N )t r a i n e db ye x p e r i m e n t a ld a t at o classify the characteristics and performance of MOFs for fixing carbon dioxide into cyclic carbonate.

In addition, biological fixation is also an attractive method to convert CO 2 into organic compounds by using organisms such as microalgae. Most of the work are focused on experimental investigations of the CO 2 conversion or utilisation efficiency. 272 Recently, Cos -gun et al. 273 studied the effect of CO 2 content on the lipid production performance by ML. They indicates that ML is helpful to determine the optimum cultivation conditions and guide for the future scale-up. Thus, the ML approaches should be further applied in the biofixation processes to identify the best CO 2 fixation rate and provide the most beneficial products.4.2.2.3 CO 2 -Enhanced coalbed methane. CO 2 -Enhanced coalbed methane (CO 2 -ECBM) takes the dual benefits of sequestering CO 2 in coal seams and displacing the coalbed methane to be produced. The injection of CO 2 in coal seams will induce significant changes in the physical and chemical properties of coal (such as pore structure, strength, elastic modulus, etc.), which in turn affects the CO 2 sequestration performance in coal seams. 244 There are few studies relate CO 2 -ECBM with ML techniques, but most of those studies apply ML techniques to predict properties of coal and gas, such as coal strength, 244 CO 2 /CH 4 adsorption isotherm, 245,246 crack initiation pressure of coal, 247 coal identification, 248 permeability, 249,250 methane production. 251 Yan et al. 244 proposed a hybrid artificial intelligence model integrating back propagation neural network (BPNN), GA and adaptive boosting algorithm (AdaBoost) to predict the unconfined compressive strength of coal according to coal rank, CO 2 interaction time, CO 2 interaction temperature and CO 2 saturation pressure. The adsorption behaviour of CO Injecting CO 2 into shale gas reservoirs is also known as one type of CCUS. When the pressure and temperature is high, CO 2 will have a higher adsorption capacity than methane, especially in the micropore volume fraction, thus enhance gas recovery. Researches regarding CO 2 sequestration and shale gas recovery with ML applications focus on the prediction of kerogen components and types, 252 methane/CO 2 adsorption capacity, [253][254][255][256] and process optimisation. 237 The types, molecular components, and structures of shale kerogen directly influence its adsorption and hydrocarbon generation. Kang et al. 9 proposed a method to combine ML with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra to predict the kerogen components and types in shale. NMR spectrum was used as the inputs since the kerogen molecule's carbon skeleton information was mainly concerned. 256 The 2D spectrum was firstly converted into a 1D matrix where the values representing the NMR spectrum's normalized values, and then was fed into fully connected neural networks (FCNNs). The outputs of the FCNNs were molecular structure labels corresponding to different NMR spectrums. They concluded this method gives excellent performance in the prediction of kerogen skeleton components and types. Meng et al. 253 utilised classical approaches and ML approaches in the forecasting of the methane adsorption in shale. Amar et al. 254 applied gene expression programming (GEP) and group method of data handling (GMDH) to predict methane adsorption in shale gas formations. The pressure, temperature, total organic carbon, and moisture were considered as input parameters, while gas content (expressed in SCF per ton) was the models' single output. Bemani et al. 255 estimated the adsorption capacity of CO 2 ,CH 4 and CO 2 /CH 4 mixture in shale through an ML-based approach. They utilised the LS-SVM to mimic the relationship between four inputs (pressure, temperature, gas composition and TOC) to the gas adsorption capacity. Wang et al. 256 utilised different ML algorithms to predict the adsorbed shale gas content using reservoir temperature, TOC, vitrinite reflectance, Langmuir pressure, and Langmuir volume. The methods used include MLR, SVM, RF and ANN. Almasov et al. 237 optimized the CO 2 Huff-N-Puff Process in a shale oil reservoir. The NPV was calculated using proxies trained through LS-SVR and GPR. The well control parameters were then optimized to have the optimal NPV. 4.2.2.4 Chemicals, fuels and building materials. CO 2 can be converted into valuable products (chemicals, 257 fuels 258 and building materials 259 ) through various physical, chemical or biological pathways. 260 One popular field is CO 2 electrochemical reduction to chemical feedstocks (such as carbon monoxide, formic acid, methanol, methane, ethanol and ethylene) that utilises both CO 2 and hydrogen from renewable energy, to achieve a circular economy. 261 Catalyst development is one of the key steps to realise selective, fast, and efficient reduction processes of CO 2 into valuable products. 262 The ML algorithms showed great advances in efficiently screening the huge number of catalysts for the CO 2 catalytic or electro-catalytic conversion. Ulissi et al. 263 proposed to use a neural-network-based surrogate model together with DFT calculations to enable exhaustive searches for active bimetallic facets and reveal active site motifs for CO 2 reduction. Recently, Zhong et al. 264 claimed that Cu-Al electrocatalysts can efficiently convert CO 2 to ethylene with the highest faradaic efficiency reported so far through ML and DFT calculations. A ML-augmented chemisorption model has also been proven to be an effective way for CO 2 electroreduction to valuable C 2 species. 265,266 Wu et al. 267 found that the computational time and prediction errors could be reduced significantly by employing an extreme GBR. Herein, 80 adsorbate-pair combinations were identified to simultaneously enhance CH 4 and C 2 production on copper after screening 289 combinations. Wan et al. 268 also proved that GBR model exhibited the best prediction performance to select the superior electrocatalysts for CO 2 reduction. Moreover, Chen et al. 269 developed a ML model based on an extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm and simple features, which can successfully and rapidly predict the Gibbs free energy change of CO adsorption of 1060 atomically dispersed metal-nonmetal co-doped graphene systems, and significantly decrease time and costs. The ML methods show a great potential in accelerating the catalyst development based on the existing experimental results. 270 Li et al. 271 evaluated five ML algorithms ( S V M ,K N N ,D T ,S G Da n dA N N )t r a i n e db ye x p e r i m e n t a ld a t at o classify the characteristics and performance of MOFs for fixing carbon dioxide into cyclic carbonate.

        <p>CO 2 can also be utilised to produce the building materials through CO 2 mineralisation. Machine learning is a powerful tool to predict the durability and performance of concrete. Taffese et al. 274 applied ANN, DT and ensemble methods to predict the carbonation depth with rationally low error, and the ML models indicated that the CaPrM model can help designers to optimise the concrete mix or structural design as well as to define proactive maintenance plan. Song et al. 275 developed a machine-learning-aided platform (ANNs) to enable the rapid, accurate, and high-throughput screening of fly ashes by predicting a structure-based proxy for their reactivity solely on the basis of bulk chemical composition, which has potential to maximise the beneficial utilisation of fly ashes such as CO 2 adsorbents and construction materials.CO 2 can also be utilised to produce the building materials through CO 2 mineralisation.

        <p>One critical reason for the employment of ML technologies is to construct input-output relations when some critical information is missed or fundamental theory is unclear, which is challenging through traditional approaches. Studies have been performed on how to monitor and detect CO 2 leakage in CCS projects using ML techniques with direct or in-direct monitoring data. The data used include seismic data, downhole monitoring information (such as pressure or TDS), porosity and permeability maps, and injection/production rate, etc. Some studies focused on employing ML to predict MMP that is a critical parameter for CO 2 -EOR. When coupling CO 2 -EOR and CCS, ML-based surrogate models (proxies) have been developed to mimic the original high-fidelity numerical models and to realise part of their functions. This can reduce computational overhead and accelerate exponentially those time-consuming jobs, such as running tens or hundreds of simulations to optimise development schedules or performing uncertainty analysis.One critical reason for the employment of ML technologies is to construct input-output relations when some critical information is missed or fundamental theory is unclear, which is challenging through traditional approaches.

        <p>In this work, we have reviewed and discussed the applications of ML in CO 2 capture, transport, storage and utilisation. Firstly, we summarised ML algorithms and suitable platforms that researchers can utilise to accelerate their CCUS research. ML has been extensively applied in both absorbent-and adsorbentbased CO 2 capture processes. For ML in CO 2 absorption, the research is focused on process simulation and optimisation, thermodynamic analysis, and solvent selections and design. As for ML in CO 2 adsorption, the research is focused on applying ML in adsorbent synthesis and characterisation, process modelling and optimisation, and process inversion. It is clear that ML is a powerful tool for screening solvents and adsorbents as well as process modelling and optimisation, which can reduce the development time, capital and operating costs for CO 2 capture. ML is also utilised in oxyfuel combustion for CO 2 capture, in applications such as predictions of combustion characteristics and pollutants emissions and monitoring the combustion process via flame images. There are also some studies available that utilise ML models for calcium looping and/or chemical looping combustion for CO 2 capture and this is an area that requires more work. Some researchers have started to apply ML to predict the performance of oxygen carriers and Ca-based sorbents, process control and technoeconomic assessment. The experience so far for ML in CO 2 absorption and adsorption, is that it can be adapted to the calcium looping and chemical looping combustion for CO 2 capture. For instance, using QSPR to find the optimal properties of oxygen carriers and Ca-based sorbents for CO 2 separation. ML is also expected to play a vital role in the development of CO 2 utilisation technologies, such as screening catalysts for CO 2 catalytic or electro-catalytic conversion, combined with the DFT calculations, and predicting suitable microalgae types and optimal cultivation conditions for carbon fixation.In this work, we have reviewed and discussed the applications of ML in CO 2 capture, transport, storage and utilisation.
