        <p>Woody-plant mortality results in the irreversible cessation of metabolism and the resultant inability to regenerate. Since widespread observations began in the 1960s, there has been evidence of increasing background tree mortality in many regions of the world 1-6 (Fig. 1a), including regional-scale die-off events 7-15 (widespread, rapid tree loss). Large mortality events have been recorded in dry tropical forests 15 , tropical rainforests [16][17][18] , temperate rainforests 19,20 , semi-arid woodland and savannahs 8,13,21 , boreal forests [22][23][24] and temperate deciduous to evergreen forests 12,25 . Such mortality is insidious in the case of the slowly but steadily increasing background mortality and dramatic in the case of die-off events.Woody-plant mortality results in the irreversible cessation of metabolism and the resultant inability to regenerate.

        <p>These contemporary increases in background tree mortality and extreme regional die-off events are associated with atmospheric warming and a corresponding increase in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and evapotranspiration 26-29 (Fig. 1b). As a result of greater water loss from foliage and soil surfaces, historically, non-lethal soil droughts have become lethal 29,30 . With anthropogenic forcing anticipated to further increase warming, as well as the frequency and duration of heatwaves and soil drought 10,30-33 (Fig. 1c), tree mortality is also expected to increase in the future 34,35 . However, rising CO 2 (Fig. 1b) can mitigate the negative impacts of increased VPD through higher carbon uptake and reduced water loss, affording potential water savings 36,37 . Contemporary observations suggest that rising VPD could be increasingly offsetting CO 2 benefits [38][39][40] , and, so, the net balance might be in favour of either greater survival or mortality 37,[41][42][43][44] .These contemporary increases in background tree mortality and extreme regional die-off events are associated with atmospheric warming and a corresponding increase in vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and evapotranspiration 26-29 (Fig. 1b).

        <p>Mechanistic understanding of such drought-related and heat-related mortality is limited. Hydraulic failure, the accumulation of sapwood emboli past a threshold after which water transport is irrecoverable, and carbon starvation, the process by which a limited supply of carbohydrate impairs maintenance of carbon-dependent metabolic, defence or hydraulic functions, have both been proposed as key processes [45][46][47] . These processes are both challenged by a lack of clear definitions and hypotheses and the large range of experimental conditions under which they have been studied, leading to a wide range of results regarding their occurrence 48 . Though recent models have incorporated these potential processes of mortality [49][50][51][52][53][54] , their interdependent contributions to drought-induced mortality of woody plants remains uncertain.Mechanistic understanding of such drought-related and heat-related mortality is limited.

        <p>Given that tree mortality leads to substantial changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, understanding drought-related mortality is fundamental to basic biology, ecosystem management and climate-feedback predictions 55,56 . Changes in ecosystem structure and function due to mortality lead to large ecohydrologic shifts, with abrupt and potentially sustained changes in streamflow 57 , as well as downstream water quality, quantity and timing 58,59 . Long-term shifts in forest demographics might also result from shifts in tree mortality rates 60 , with corresponding limitations to net terrestrial carbon storage 11 ; a doubling of mortality halves forest carbon storage over 50 years if net primary production doesn't equally increase. Resulting impacts on biodiversity might be large and surprisingly unpredictable at regional and global scales, and likely depend on disturbance type, biome and species, among other factors 61,62 . Moreover, the economic impacts of forest loss, particularly in regions where wood production is vital to societal well-being, could be substantial 63 .Given that tree mortality leads to substantial changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, understanding drought-related mortality is fundamental to basic biology, ecosystem management and climate-feedback predictions 55,56 .

        <p>In this Review, we synthesize understanding of woody-plant mortality under rising VPD and CO 2 . We begin with a discussion of contemporary, observed drought-associated tree mortality. We follow with consideration of three general, interdependent mechanisms of tree mortality -water relations, carbon relations and defensive failure -and propose an integrative, predictive framework for mortality under a changing global climate. We subsequently examine how such processes might interact to promote vulnerability and influence future projections. We end with recommendations for future research. Throughout the Review, all mechanisms are treated as part of the mortality process: that is, from failure of root water uptake through to hydraulic failure, carbon starvation and irreversible cell dehydration. We consider a plant in the 'dying' phase to have passed a point of no return or a threshold [64][65][66][67][68][69][70] , beyond which mortality of the organ (branch dieback) 71 or the entire plant is certain. Processes that occur before the dying phase can be critical in promoting or delaying mortality, whereas those that occur thereafter can be considered consequences, not causes.In this Review, we synthesize understanding of woody-plant mortality under rising VPD and CO 2 .

        <p>Understanding and predicting mortality under future climate requires a framework that provides unambiguous definitions, generates testable hypotheses and identifies uncertainties. In the case of drought-associated woody-plant mortality, this framework is expected to also identify pools and fluxes of critical resources and their potential lethal thresholds, and to be relevant across different biomes and environmental conditions. Previous frameworks have advanced knowledge of drought-related mortality [45][46][47]79 . However, existing frameworks grapple with the complexity of the interdependent processes that occur while trees are dying [45][46][47]80 , including hydraulic failure, carbon starvation and attack by biotic agents 81,82 (Fig. 2). Overall, there remains a lack of consensus on the appropriate terminology, mechanisms and, ultimately, a clear set of hypotheses.Understanding and predicting mortality under future climate requires a framework that provides unambiguous definitions, generates testable hypotheses and identifies uncertainties.

        <p>Owing to consistent evidence of deteriorating water status during death [45][46][47]80 and widespread prevalence of hydraulic dysfunction in drought-associated mortality 13,14,22,23 , the mechanisms underlying woody-plant mortality originate from a whole-plant water-relations backbone. Examining mortality can start from a basic end point in the process: the rupture of cell membranes owing to water content falling below a critical threshold, preventing plant recovery 65,68 (Figs 2,3). Crossing this critical threshold depends, in part, on the absolute water content below which the cells cannot survive, the osmoregulation potential of the cells and the capacity to provide substrates and energy for continuous membrane maintenance and osmolyte production 68 . Such cellular death must manifest across tissues at the whole-plant scale and eventually impact all meristematic cells needed for growth and reproduction before organismal mortality has occurred. Thus, while plant water relations are the keystone process for drought-associated mortality, hydraulic function and associated failure might also depend on starch and sugar availability, thus, water and carbon supply, and their respective cellular reservoir size, might be critical for survival 83 .Owing to consistent evidence of deteriorating water status during death [45][46][47]80 and widespread prevalence of hydraulic dysfunction in drought-associated mortality 13,14,22,23 , the mechanisms underlying woody-plant mortality originate from a whole-plant water-relations backbone.

        <p>Whole-plant water relations preceding mortality. Failure of whole-plant water relations and subsequent mortality occurs through a series of sequential and interdependent mechanisms (Fig. 3). First, a severe decline in root water uptake, whole-plant hydraulic conductance and associated stomatal closure 84,85 occurs, causing the water and carbon pools to become finite and exhaustible. The depletion of water pools is followed by continued loss of water through evaporation from plant surfaces and, subsequently, increasing occurrence of sapwood embolism as water pools are depleted 86,87 . Ultimately, hydraulic failure occurs and subsequent downstream mortality ensues as water pools deplete below the threshold for irreversible cell death 46,[64][65][66][67][68] , known as cell wall rupture or cytorrhysis 88,89 . In this view, hydraulic failure is a mechanism within the larger process of mortality, rather than a sole cause in itself. Hydraulic failure in woody plants, strictly defined, is the accumulation of emboli within conduits causing a decline in conductance and an increase in tension of the remaining conduits, creating a feedback loop of runaway cavitation and, subsequently, insufficient distal water supply relative to water loss. By definition, hydraulic failure includes a threshold resulting from the whole-plant processes of water flow, that is, a threshold beyond which recovery of flow is impossible due to emboli accumulation within conduits. Critically, the importance of fluxes and pools of water to survival increases as drought progresses 83 (Fig. 3). The sequence of events that promotes a constraint upon survival through failure of whole-plant water relations and associated hydraulic failure is now discussed. Drying soil demands a steep increase in the amount of tension, or water potential gradient, that plants must withstand to extract soil water 90 . The soil-root interface becomes a primary limitation on whole-plant Fig. 2 | the interconnected mortality process. A hypothetical representation of the mortality processes from predisposing factors to death. Predisposing factors are linked to mortality via the mechanisms in the second innermost ring, which subsequently cause a plant to pass a threshold beyond which mortality is inevitable.

        <p>As hydraulic failure and cytorrhysis ensue for some tissues, crown dieback (foliage and branch loss) and root loss will advance, and, if the damage proceeds to destroy all meristematic tissues, individual mortality occurs (Fig. 3). Such cellular failure can occur at organ (dieback) or individual (mortality) levels, depending on its extent and the degree of hydraulic segmentation within the plant. Variation in cellular thresholds for survival is likely substantial and could be important in regulating where and when woody-plant mortality occurs. The threshold for cellular cytorrhysis is above 0% water content 89 and might vary with species, genotypes, phenotypes, tissue and cell types, but remains relatively unexplored in woody plants.As hydraulic failure and cytorrhysis ensue for some tissues, crown dieback (foliage and branch loss) and root loss will advance, and, if the damage proceeds to destroy all meristematic tissues, individual mortality occurs (Fig. 3).

        <p>Evaporative losses after stomatal closure are dominated by residual vapour fluxes through leaky stomata, cuticle, bark and possibly roots [99][100][101][102][103] (residual conductance (g res )). The evaporative flux through g res becomes the dominant path of whole-plant water loss during a severe drought and is exacerbated at high air temperatures 86,87 . Continued water loss (which is not replaced) results in declining water pools and increasing embolism (Fig. 3). Even under situations where the soil-root connection is maintained, if the fluxes of water to the plant are smaller than those lost through g res , the stored pools of water will deplete and embolisms will develop.Evaporative losses after stomatal closure are dominated by residual vapour fluxes through leaky stomata, cuticle, bark and possibly roots [99][100][101][102][103] (residual conductance (g res )).

        <p>The bidirectional feedbacks between the depletion of water pools and irreparable hydraulic failure is a logical and testable hypothesis for mortality progression. However, a water-only perspective ignores the potentially critical roles of carbon and defence against biotic agents during drought, both of which could promote failure of water relations if they individually fail. During short and hotter droughts, failure to maintain the critical water supply can dominate the mortality process because of the rapid rate of water loss relative to the rate of carbohydrate and defensive losses [104][105][106][107] . In longer droughts, or in cases of mortality years after drought, the role of carbon supply to critical survival processes should increase [104][105][106][107] due to the far longer residence time and slower changes in carbohydrates than in water pools 108,109 .The bidirectional feedbacks between the depletion of water pools and irreparable hydraulic failure is a logical and testable hypothesis for mortality progression.

        <p>The water-carbon interdependency. The process by which plants' carbon economy has a role in mortality before, during and after lethal droughts involves multiple potential mechanisms. These include those associated with decreased photosynthetic gain 45 , reduced xylem and constitutive defensive compound production [110][111][112][113] , initial carbohydrate storage increases and then decreases prior to death 11, , a critical increasing role of carbohydrates in osmoregulation and cellular maintenance [115][116][117][118][119][120][121][122] , and possible carbohydrate feedbacks upon hydraulic and defensive function 47 . In this view, carbon starvation, or the steps by which metabolic functions are impaired by limitations in the supply rate of carbohydrates, is a mechanism within the larger process of carbon limitations upon mortality. These mechanisms are described chronologically from pre-drought through the dying phases (Figs 2,3).The water-carbon interdependency.

        <p>There is evidence that water-carbon-related factors that occur prior to drought can promote mortality (Fig. 2). Decades-long reductions in carbon allocation to stem wood and resin ducts within dying conifer species indicate potential roles of pre-drought allocation to mortality [105][106][107][110][111][112][113] . Low growth preceding death can be a lingering consequence of prior climate or injuries that predispose trees to carbon constraints 79 (Fig. 2). By contrast, shifts in allocation towards greater pre-drought growth can also influence mortality owing to reduced allocation to defence at the expense of growth [123][124][125][126][127] or from over-allocation to aboveground biomass (in particular, leaf area at the individual and stand levels) during favourable conditions, which cannot be sustained during subsequent hotter droughts (structural overshoot) 76 . A feedback loop can be created, in which pre-drought factors can predispose plants to mortality during drought (Fig. 2). Indeed, declines in growth, hydraulic function and defence can be a function of reductions in crown leaf area owing to crown dieback or root loss from prior drought, lightning, wind damage and defoliating or root-feeding insects or pathogens [128][129][130][131][132][133] . However, declining leaf area can also promote survival by reducing water loss during drought 134,135 . The net consequence of pre-drought shifts in carbon and water pools and fluxes remains a research challenge.There is evidence that water-carbon-related factors that occur prior to drought can promote mortality (Fig. 2). Decades-long reductions in carbon allocation to stem wood and resin ducts within dying conifer species indicate potential roles of pre-drought allocation to mortality [105][106][107][110][111][112][113] . Low growth preceding death can be a lingering consequence of prior climate or injuries that predispose trees to carbon constraints 79 (Fig. 2). By contrast, shifts in allocation towards greater pre-drought growth can also influence mortality owing to reduced allocation to defence at the expense of growth [123][124][125][126][127] or from over-allocation to aboveground biomass (in particular, leaf area at the individual and stand levels) during favourable conditions, which cannot be sustained during subsequent hotter droughts (structural overshoot) 76 . A feedback loop can be created, in which pre-drought factors can predispose plants to mortality during drought (Fig. 2). Indeed, declines in growth, hydraulic function and defence can be a function of reductions in crown leaf area owing to crown dieback or root loss from prior drought, lightning, wind damage and defoliating or root-feeding insects or pathogens [128][129][130][131][132][133] . However, declining leaf area can also promote survival by reducing water loss during drought 134,135 . The net consequence of pre-drought shifts in carbon and water pools and fluxes remains a research challenge.</p>
        <p>Once drought has become sufficiently severe and/or prolonged such that photosynthesis has declined to near zero, the starvation process can promote mortality through water relations or defensive failure (Fig. 3). Carbon starvation is the process by which carbon-dependent metabolism, defence and possibly hydraulic maintenance are shifted owing to limited carbon supply rate relative to demand (Fig. 4). This definition is consistent with the literature on starvation across global animal and plant taxa [136][137][138] , which characterize starvation as causing significant shifts in metabolism, which are reversible, until a threshold is passed, after which the interdependent processes required for survival are not met. Carbon starvation is considered to occur nightly in plants 139 , though for the purposes of drought-associated mortality, this process becomes relevant when stomatal closure precludes photosynthesis relative to carbon demand for abnormally prolonged periods (months to years). Starvation manifests at the cellular scale but can occur widely throughout an organism. As starvation progresses, the supply rate and/or pool of carbohydrates (sugars derived from starch, lipid and hemicellulose breakdown, as well as products derived from autophagy) [140][141][142] could possibly decline below the threshold at which cellular to whole-tree mortality is promoted. Such thresholds can include the minimum metabolism required for survival, failure to maintain membrane stability, inability to maintain the osmotic functions for the hydraulic system or failure to maintain the defence system (Figs 3,4).Once drought has become sufficiently severe and/or prolonged such that photosynthesis has declined to near zero, the starvation process can promote mortality through water relations or defensive failure (Fig. 3).

        <p>It is the interplay between the available carbon pools, their fluxes and the demands for survival that cause carbohydrate supply rates to not meet the requirements to avoid hydraulic failure 105,[143][144][145] or insect and/or pathogen defence failure 79,146,147 (Figs 3,4). If an insufficient supply rate of carbon substrates to required metabolic processes 115 results from short-distance or long-distance transport constraints, for example, through source strength impacts upon phloem loading and viscosity challenges [148][149][150][151] , failure of carbon-dependent processes could be promoted. Declining resistance to xylem embolism has been associated with low carbohydrate concentrations 145 . Reduced carbon supply rates can promote osmoregulation failure, loss of protein and membrane stability, failure to scavenge free radicals and reductions in cross-membrane transport of ions and amino acids [115][116][117][118][119][120][121][122] . Simultaneously, the carbon requirements for these processes increase with drought stress 45,[152][153][154][155][156][157] , thus, the carbon safety margin, or the difference between carbon availability and demand, decreases with drought. Therefore, failure to maintain hydraulic integrity and cellular water content appear directly linked to the carbon economy of plants (Fig. 3), particularly under longer droughts.It is the interplay between the available carbon pools, their fluxes and the demands for survival that cause carbohydrate supply rates to not meet the requirements to avoid hydraulic failure 105,[143][144][145] or insect and/or pathogen defence failure 79,146,147 (Figs 3,4).

        <p>The water-carbon-defence interdependency. Attacks by biotic agents such as insects or pathogens are frequently concomitant with drought-associated mortality prior to, during or shortly after the drought event 81,[158][159][160] , and are likely interdependently associated with impacts on carbon and water relations (Figs 3,4). When a biotic attack occurs prior to drought, it can impact plants through defoliation or root loss, predisposing plants to subsequent mortality if the attack impaired their water and carbon economies (Figs 3,4). When drought stress predisposes trees to attack, it can lead to hydraulic failure if the vascular system is infected [161][162][163] . Biotic agents can disrupt carbon uptake and transport through leaf loss 164 or depletion of carbohydrate reserves via direct consumption 165,166 , and they can stimulate a plant's induced defence response 167,168 .The water-carbon-defence interdependency.

        <p>The initiation of regional-scale outbreaks typically occurs during or after drought when the defensive capacity of host trees is constrained, and a critical number of vulnerable trees becomes susceptible across the landscape [169][170][171] . The level of stress that limits defensive function remains unknown owing to a lack of empirical evidence linking carbohydrates, hydraulics and defences in field experiments with mature trees 172 . Experiments that preclude biotic attack, however, such as caging, insecticide/fungicide and anti-aggregation pheromones, have demonstrated that some insects, fungi and other pathogens have the potential to directly move drought-weakened plants into the dying phase, while those free of biotic attack survive 47 (Fig. 3). In these cases, the roles of the plant water and carbon economies in defensive failure can be substantial.The initiation of regional-scale outbreaks typically occurs during or after drought when the defensive capacity of host trees is constrained, and a critical number of vulnerable trees becomes susceptible across the landscape [169][170][171] .

        <p>The water and carbon economies directly impact the defensive system, such that failure of one component can lead to failure of another (Fig. 4). The relative water content and water potential of cells directly impacts turgor pressure and the substrate transport critical to defence 173,174 . Synthesis of secondary metabolites and metabolic transport costs of the defensive system depend directly on labile carbon availability for induced defences [173][174][175][176] (Fig. 4). Higher sugar concentrations are associated with reduced attack by insects and fungi, demonstrating the potential role of carbohydrates in defence, perhaps through fuelling induced responses 174,176 . Defensive compounds have a particularly high carbon concentration 177 and tend to be upregulated at the transcriptional level during drought 178,179 . Similarly, a rapid increase in defensive allocation upon attack has been associated with declining local carbohydrates 168 . Thus, defence incurs a substantial carbon cost 180 (Fig. 4), suggesting that reduced carbohydrate supply rates could render the plant susceptible to biotic attack 181,182 . For example, conifers with fewer resin ducts formed in years prior to drought are frequently more likely to die during beetle attack 111,167,[183][184][185][186] , consistent with a carbon constraint inducing defensive failure. When insects and pathogens reach epidemic levels, the attacks might switch from the poorly defended to the faster-growing, well-defended plants due to the higher availability of resources available to the attacking agents 127 .

        <p>The interdependent framework of mechanisms. This framework (Figs 234) outlines the individual mechanisms within the larger processes that lead plants into the dying phase. As a plant enters a hotter drought with higher VPD, it must manage limited water resources amidst the edaphic and structural conditions that it enters the drought with (Fig. 2), including defensive dependence and hydraulic dependence on carbon allocation to sapwood, roots and foliage prior to the drought. As drought ensues and belowground and stomatal conductance declines to near zero, embolisms can accumulate, thus, reducing whole-plant conductance and photosynthesis, setting up a feedback cycle. Once water fluxes approach zero, the finite pools and fluxes of water and carbon become exhaustible, while demands for allocation of carbohydrates to osmoregulation and maintenance of cellular, defensive and, potentially, hydraulic metabolism rise (Fig. 3). Thus, allocation to sapwood, roots, foliage and carbohydrates prior to drought, and to osmoregulation, cytorrhysis tolerance and defence during drought, can all feed back directly upon the likelihood of hydraulic failure, with rising VPD causing a smaller threshold between survival and mortality. However, rising CO 2 might influence such mortality either through promoting structural overshoot or water use benefits, either promoting or delaying mortality as VPD rises (Box 1).The interdependent framework of mechanisms.

        <p>Potential thresholds also emerge from the mortality mechanisms framework. A decline in cellular water pools below the threshold for cytorrhysis is a clear point of no return of lethal dehydration, which results from the chain of hydraulic events that leads to a threshold amount of hydraulic failure, after which the cytorrhysis threshold was exceeded. The maintenance of the hydraulic system, avoidance of hydraulic failure and minimization and tolerance of cellular dehydration might all depend directly on carbon pool sizes and fluxes to sites of demand. Likewise, induced defensive responses depend on localized fluxes of both water and carbohydrates. These are all possible key failure points within the system -the loss of one can trigger a cascade of losses in the others. These individual or interdependent failures at small scales (tissue to organ), with VPD and CO 2 dependencies, will reduce survival likelihood at the whole-plant level.Potential thresholds also emerge from the mortality mechanisms framework.

        <p>Existing predictions of future forest mortality are limited, but all point to a common threat of increasing background mortality and die-off events. For example, according to an empirical model, regional-scale conifer loss is predicted across the Southwestern USA by 2050 owing to increases in VPD, along with periodic droughts 29 . These findings were confirmed using multiple tree-scale and ecosystem-scale process models, with Earth system models predicting widespread conifer mortality throughout the Northern Hemisphere, again due to drying 35 . Predictions of increasing future mortality also exist for aspen, eucalypts, conifers and a broad suite of ecosystems under climate change [187][188][189] .

Trees are simulated in a Swiss forest where there were physiological observations of both dying and surviving Norway spruce (Picea abies) during a severe drought in 2018 (reF. 104 ). Model-predicted percentage loss of whole-tree conductance (PLC plant ) is used as an index of the risk of mortality as prognostic of drought-associated mortality 48,80,189 ; higher PLC plant indicates greater loss of conductance and a greater likelihood of hydraulic failure. Predicting mortality from PLC assumes that PLC plant captures any changes in carbon metabolism that might drive variation in PLC (Fig. 3). Model-data evaluation suggests that models simulated surviving trees better than dying trees (Fig. 5a), particularly late in the mortality process, and, so, estimates of PLC in dying trees are conservative.To highlight how some potential mortality mechanisms respond to changing climate, a multi-model analysis of mortality likelihood under the independent and combined impacts of rising VPD and CO 2 is provided (Fig. 5; Supplementary Information).

        <p>While not modelled in the simulations, it is important to note that the impact of rising CO 2 on photosynthesis and carbohydrate pools also has implications for defence against biotic attack. Defensive failure can occur via shifts in total nonstructural carbohydrates, specific leaf area and reallocation of leaf nitrogen, all of which alter plant host quality, and thus, suitability for herbivores 202 . Elevated CO 2 also affects host susceptibility and resistance to biotic attack by altering the synthesis or downregulation of phytochemical defence compounds 203 . However, complete resource budgets that document the fluxes and pools of carbon to and from the defence system has not been done, potentially limiting the capacity of models to forecast future mortality. where ambient represents the control simulation using 2018 observed climate.

The models and modelling approach are described in the Supplemental Information. Elevated CO 2 could alleviate mortality risk, while elevated VPD can increase it.While not modelled in the simulations, it is important to note that the impact of rising CO 2 on photosynthesis and carbohydrate pools also has implications for defence against biotic attack. Defensive failure can occur via shifts in total nonstructural carbohydrates, specific leaf area and reallocation of leaf nitrogen, all of which alter plant host quality, and thus, suitability for herbivores 202 . Elevated CO 2 also affects host susceptibility and resistance to biotic attack by altering the synthesis or downregulation of phytochemical defence compounds 203 . However, complete resource budgets that document the fluxes and pools of carbon to and from the defence system has not been done, potentially limiting the capacity of models to forecast future mortality. where ambient represents the control simulation using 2018 observed climate.

        <p>Mortality mechanisms under rising VPD and CO 2 . When examined within the context of rising VPD and CO 2 , several clear hypotheses originate from the proposed drought-associated mortality framework and the model results (Fig. 5). Perhaps the most critical hypotheses are that drought-associated mortality is triggered physiologically by severe declines in belowground hydraulic conductance, with the concurrent water loss, and the water-based and carbon-based thresholds for cytorrhysis, all linking together to drive plants into the dying stage (Figs 234). Further, the logical emergent hypothesis is that rising VPD negatively impacts plant survival during drought, whereas rising CO 2 can have both positive and negative impacts on mortality likelihood (Box 1). These hypotheses are well supported by non-mortality research but have rarely been examined in relation to drought-induced death 200,201 . Hypothesized mechanisms underlying these responses also emerge. As exposure to VPD accumulates, both through prolonged chronic rises and extreme events, water loss increases, which, if not met by increased belowground supply, forces plant water pools to decline. Furthermore, rising VPD promotes stomatal closure, which reduces carbon supply at the whole-plant scale. Rising CO 2 , by contrast, can reduce water loss through stomatal closure and increase photosynthetic rates, leading to higher water content and carbon supply, subsequently reducing mortality likelihood (Box 1). However, structural overshoot leading to reduced root allocation relative to shoot allocation can predispose trees to mortality through reductions in both water and carbon supply demand during drought. Structural overshoot could also potentially happen at the stand level, in which larger biomass leads to more competition for finite resources (including water and nutrients) 204 during drought.Mortality mechanisms under rising VPD and CO 2 .

        <p>The interdependency between carbon-related and water-related mechanisms of drought-associated mortality suggest that cytorrhysis occurs when the carbon supply rate needed to maintain hydraulic function exceeds a minimum threshold for survival (Box 1). An equally likely hypothesis is that water content can fall below the threshold for cytorrhysis before the minimum carbon supply rate is surpassed. Both scenarios could occur depending on the length of the drought and the accumulated exposure to VPD. For example, particularly severe droughts with higher cumulative VPD might promote more rapid drops in water content than in carbon supply rate, thus, exceeding the water content threshold for mortality prior to that for carbon supply rate. Therefore, an associated critical test is to determine the water content and carbon supply rate thresholds and how they respond to increasing cumulative VPD and CO 2 .The interdependency between carbon-related and water-related mechanisms of drought-associated mortality suggest that cytorrhysis occurs when the carbon supply rate needed to maintain hydraulic function exceeds a minimum threshold for survival (Box 1).

        <p>Challenges to modelling mortality Models provide useful hypothesis-generating tools for understanding the impacts of a changing environment on mortality (Fig. 5). Models have improved considerably in the representation of water and carbohydrate dynamics at the organ to whole-plant level, and implemented at scales from individual plants to the terrestrial biosphere [49][50][51][52][53][54]86,[205][206][207] . The coupling between carbon and water at both long and short timescales can now be represented 205,206 , although many of the carbon-water interdependencies in the proposed framework (Fig. 3) are either not yet developed or remain untested. Furthermore, gas exchange is represented ever more elegantly 189 . Some models also represent cuticular fluxes and their temperature sensitivity and the subsequent drawdown of internal water pools 86 (Fig. 3). Many models are also trait based and incorporate parameters that are potentially critical to mortality (Fig. 3), some of which can be empirically measured a priori, allowing mechanistically constrained parameterization and large scaling potential 188 .Challenges to modelling mortality Models provide useful hypothesis-generating tools for understanding the impacts of a changing environment on mortality (Fig. 5).

        <p>Nevertheless, there remain numerous modelling challenges for those processes that are represented and those that are not, owing, in part, to the interactive nature of mortality drivers and mechanisms. These challenges are highlighted by the model analyses, which, in some cases, failed to capture the particularly negative water potentials of dying trees (Fig. 5a). For those processes captured by models, there can be difficulty in constraining the response functions. For example, belowground conductance is poorly constrained, owing to a lack of empirical measurements. Furthermore, some processes that might be critical to mortality are not yet represented by ecosystem-process models, notably, biotic agents, the attacks of which often coincide with drought 167 . Few models additionally represent the starvation-related mechanisms that could promote the mortality process, including the carbohydrate dependency of metabolism, osmoregulation and hydraulic and defensive functions. Failure of phloem transport can exacerbate localized carbon starvation 130,144,208 but is rarely modelled (but see reF. 149 ). Representation of these processes will require more empirical and numerical testing to justify their inclusion in already complex modelling schemes.Nevertheless, there remain numerous modelling challenges for those processes that are represented and those that are not, owing, in part, to the interactive nature of mortality drivers and mechanisms.

        <p>A further challenge in modelling woody-plant mortality is the absence of acclimation, partly related to a lack of knowledge of what parameters acclimate and at what rate. If acclimation keeps pace with changes in climate and CO 2 , multiple traits could enhance survival likelihood. Some traits that could acclimate to reduced water loss under elevated CO 2 and VPD include reductions in maximum stomatal conductance (g max ), g res and individual plant leaf area, along with increases in embolism resistance (estimated as the pressure at which 50% of conductance is lost (P50)).A further challenge in modelling woody-plant mortality is the absence of acclimation, partly related to a lack of knowledge of what parameters acclimate and at what rate.

        <p>The impacts of these trait shifts on mortality likelihood were assessed using the SurEau model, representing a spruce tree in the year 2100 (Fig. 6). In this set of scenarios, if g res and P50 decline by 10%, PLC declines (within distal branches) from &gt;90% to ~35%. Similar 10% declines in g max and individual leaf area push PLC likelihood from &gt;90% all the way to 0%. These declines in PLC likelihood translate into declining risk of mortality. Accordingly, reductions in these traits are beneficial to survival under a changing environment (though reductions in all but g res will constrain carbon uptake). g max might acclimate 190,191,209 , while P50 has exhibited acclimation potential in angiosperms 210 but less so in gymnosperms 211 .

        <p>Ultimately, acclimation could be important in survival over longer time periods. However, punctuated droughts and heatwaves can occur much too rapidly for acclimation to manifest (except in the case of leaf loss, which occurs in angiosperms during droughts and heatwaves) 212,213 and exacerbate mortality 33 . Heatwaves are of particular concern because they dramatically increase VPD and leaf temperature when water availability is limited, with foliage typically dying at temperatures above 54 °C (reF. 214 ). Beyond acclimation, the extension of the phenological cycle through elevated temperature in temperate and boreal regions could, however, mitigate some of the above-mentioned challenges to the potential of acclimation to mitigate mortality likelihood [215][216][217] , with complicated impacts on mortality-reproduction relationships in masting species 218 . A longer growing season can also promote greater water loss, so the net impacts remain unknown.Ultimately, acclimation could be important in survival over longer time periods.

        <p>Increasing background mortality rates (Fig. 1a) are alarming in the context of the strong current and future increases in their environmental drivers (Fig. 1b,c). The broad geographic distribution of rising mortality suggests a globally distributed driver, which is consistent with physiological theory (Figs 234) and model results (Fig. 5) that suggest elevated CO 2 and VPD could be critical drivers (Box 1). Mortality appears to be initiated by severe reductions in belowground conductance and subsequent increased risk of hydraulic failure as embolism increases with continued water loss from g res and carbon starvation as stomata shut and, thus, curtail photosynthesis (Fig. 3). Lost hydraulic conductance most immediately increases the risk of hydraulic failure, but if drought is sufficiently prolonged, can deplete carbohydrate stores and fluxes required to maintain metabolism and defence (Fig. 4). Acclimation to drought, CO 2 and VPD could provide some buffering of mortality against environmental change, if such acclimation is of sufficient magnitude and speed to accommodate the rapid rate of climate change (Figs 1b,c,5). The emergent framework generates a set of hypotheses that require testing if understanding and simulation of woody-plant mortality is to be improved under a changing climate.Increasing background mortality rates (Fig. 1a) are alarming in the context of the strong current and future increases in their environmental drivers (Fig. 1b,c).

        <p>The proposed framework identifies considerable experimental challenges, particularly for quantifying the key mortality mechanisms and thresholds, and the carbon-water-defence interdependencies that matter most to survival. For example, we must identify the point-of-no-return value for each critical pool and flux , their timing of achieving the threshold and their dependence upon interacting mechanisms. Identifying these thresholds and their underlying mechanisms is achievable through detailed experimentation that investigates the dynamics and interdependencies of the hydraulic, carbon and defensive mechanisms, pools and fluxes, during the dying process.The proposed framework identifies considerable experimental challenges, particularly for quantifying the key mortality mechanisms and thresholds, and the carbon-water-defence interdependencies that matter most to survival.

        <p>In addition to experimental challenges, multiple steps can be taken to test the hypotheses regarding mortality mechanisms (Figs 234). Understanding the predisposing factors, such as differences in carbon allocation to water conduction traits and how they predispose or protect plants from drought-associated death, will require long-term observational and experimental studies. Examining the timing and magnitudes of hydraulic limitations (Fig. 3) and the hydraulic point of no return is feasible 66 . However, a substantial challenge remains to quantify belowground hydraulic dynamics accurately 90 , including xylary and extra-xylary components of the pathway. Identifying when and where belowground conductance approaches zero is critical, as it sets the rest of the mortality mechanisms into motion 98 (Fig. 3) and is likely essential to accurate modelling (Fig. 5). Likewise, identifying dehydration thresholds and quantifying how long plants can survive on water stores, while losing water to g res under a warming atmosphere, is a large but critical challenge.In addition to experimental challenges, multiple steps can be taken to test the hypotheses regarding mortality mechanisms (Figs 234).

        <p>Many components of the proposed carbon failure process are also possible to measure. However, identifying the key carbon-based mechanisms leading to mortality will require substantial investment in developing detailed carbon budgets at both the whole-plant and the cellular scales, as has been done for Arabidopsis under mild drought 219 . Such carbon budgets must integrate and quantify the fluctuating carbon demands for metabolic and defensive maintenance, osmoregulation and hydraulic function, and can use metabolomic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches.

        <p>The role of temporal and spatial shifts in mechanisms that lead to mortality are a largely unexplored frontier that must be addressed to reduce model uncertainty. We must determine to what degree can acclimation promote survival and to what degree does a lack of acclimation promote mortality. For plants that can adjust rooting depths, g res , g smax , P50, leaf area (Fig. 6) and other critical variables prior to severe droughts, survival likelihood is increased. If they shift at all 212 , the rate of shifts in these variables must be quantified to enable improved predictions. However, non-adaptive acclimation is also a threat, in which extended periods of mesic conditions could promote carbon allocation to increased leaf area and decreased root area (or decreased sapwood area or a myriad of other shifts) that predispose the plant to death when water limitations are severe 76,213 . Scaling of predictions to the ecosystem, region and globe requires consideration of the distinct allometries and allocation patterns of different species/plant functional types 134 and on the distribution of plant roots relative to ephemeral versus constant water sources 206,223,224 . Furthermore, the role of stand density remains a large question 18,225 . If rising CO 2 promotes increasing stand density during periods of abundant precipitation, then when a drought occurs, the stand might be overstocked relative to the site's ability to provide water, thus, promoting mortality.
