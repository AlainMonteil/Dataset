        <p>Plastic products are widely used, making the annual output of plastic products worldwide exceeded 3.48 × 10 8 tonnes and is increasing at a rate of 0.2 × 10 8 tonne acre -1 (Statista, 2017). Based on their mass production and use, plastic products inevitably enter the aquatic environment: for example, more than 2.5 × 10 5 tonnes of plastic waste were estimated to be floating on the global ocean surface (Eriksen et al., 2014). In the aquatic environment, plastic waste can be fragmented into microplastics (debris &lt; 5 mm in diameter) by physical, photo and bio-degradation (Law and Thompson, 2014). The investigation of microplastic pollution has mainly focused on the marine environment (Cole et al., 2011;Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014), including Canada (Desforges et al., 2014), Brazil (Santana et al., 2016), the UK and neighbouring countries such as the Netherlands (Barnes et al., 2009), China (Zhang et al., 2017;Zhang et al., 2019), Antarctica (Cincinelli et al., 2017) and in deep-sea Arctic sediments (Kanhai et al. 2019).Plastic products are widely used, making the annual output of plastic products worldwide exceeded 3.48 × 10 8 tonnes and is increasing at a rate of 0.2 × 10 8 tonne acre -1 (Statista, 2017).

        <p>Marine microplastic debris can be a possible contributing factor to biodiversity loss and a potential threat to human health. The impacts plastics on aquatic life are influenced by the size of the debris: large plastic debris, such as discarded fishing lines and nets, often cause entanglement among invertebrates, birds, mammals and turtles (Gall and Thompson, 2015;A. Lusher, 2015). Smaller plastic items, such as bottle caps and less dense plastics can cause intestinal obstruction (Law and Thompson, 2014). Plastics and their degradation products are ingested by a variety of aquatic life ranging from invertebrates to fish with varied Wang, 2019;Shahul Hamid et al. 2018). Therefore, the focus of this review is to assess the magnitude of global microplastic pollution in freshwater environments, providing information compiled from recent research associated with the sources, occurrence, fate and effects of microplastics in freshwater environments. In addition, this review provides a discussion of the analytical approaches employed for the study of microplastics and the current state and development of policy related to microplastic pollution.Marine microplastic debris can be a possible contributing factor to biodiversity loss and a potential threat to human health.

        <p>The rate of fragmentation and degradation of plastics is unknown even for marine environments (Law and Thompson, 2014). Varying degrees of physical forces, such as waves in oceanic systems; environmental conditions, such as sunlight, pH and temperature; and the physical and chemical properties of the plastic itself are thought to play a role in plastic degradation. Plastics in freshwater systems also undergo physical and environmental degradation despite milder physical forces than in marine environments (Andrady, 2011). Some environmental conditions may have a larger impact within freshwater, for example Free et al. (2014) showed that plastic fragments may undergo relatively intense weathering because of high ultraviolet penetration in poorly nourished lakes (Free et al., 2014). However, overall degradation patterns of microplastics in freshwater were found to be similar to those in the marine environment: cracks, pits, and adherent particles (Imhof et al., 2013;Zbyszewski and Corcoran, 2011).The rate of fragmentation and degradation of plastics is unknown even for marine environments (Law and Thompson, 2014).

        <p>The degree of weathering to the surface of microplastics can be used to track the history of the particles. Hence, surface features can show whether plastic debris underwent mechanical degradation, for example from the action of waves, sand friction (Zbyszewski et al., 2014), oxidative weathering such as from the exposure to UV-B (Zbyszewski et al., 2014), or biodegradation such as by the action of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (Zettler et al., 2013). Insights into the effect of organic matter on microplastic degradation in sedimentary environments such as beaches and muddy coastlines were also reported by Zbyszewski et al. (2014). Identifying the degradation patterns of plastics in different environments is important as this can reveal how particles interact with the environment and how various factors affect their stability, transport, fate, and indicate potential effects to organisms (Ballent et al., 2016).The degree of weathering to the surface of microplastics can be used to track the history of the particles.

        <p>A spatial correlation has been found between the types of microplastics found at particular sites and human activities in surrounding areas (Lechner et al., 2014). In addition, the type of polymer and their concentration can be used to link microplastics with their origin. For example, microplastics found in the Great Lakes of North America are similar in size, shape, colour, and elemental composition to those found in facial cleansers (Eriksen et al., 2013). At the same time, microplastic particles in the effluent of a sewage treatment plant were very similar in colour, shape and size to those in toothpaste formulations, revealing that the plastic particles in personal care products may be among the sources of microplastic pollution in freshwater environments (Carr et al., 2016). Industrial sources of microplastics can also be identified even in large rivers such as the Danube River (Lechner et al., 2014). As opposed to rivers, stationary bodies of water such as lakes may accumulate more microplastics (Free et al., 2014;Imhof et al., 2013). Industrial resin particles and microspheres were found to be abundant in Lake Erie near the Huron Lake industrial zone (Eriksen et al., 2013;Zbyszewski and Corcoran, 2011). Large amounts of secondary microplastics (or microplastics derived from fragmentation of other plastics) were found along the shores of sparsely populated mountain lakes, where there was scarce primary microplastic pollution (Free et al., 2014).A spatial correlation has been found between the types of microplastics found at particular sites and human activities in surrounding areas (Lechner et al., 2014).

        <p>Areas near tourist sites are also especially affected by microplastic pollution, and a representative example is the concentration of microplastics (i.e. 5,000-757,500 units Km -2 ) found in China's Qinghai Lake (Xiong et al., 2018).Areas near tourist sites are also especially affected by microplastic pollution, and a representative example is the concentration of microplastics (i.e. 5,000-757,500 units Km -2 ) found in China's Qinghai Lake (Xiong et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Direct sources of microplastic pollution include discharge from sewage treatment plants (Browne, 2015), weathering and degradation of plastic waste in water bodies (Eerkes-Medrano et al., 2015), and terrestrial input from soil erosion or surface runoff (Horton et al., 2017). The contribution of these sources remains controversial. Carr et al. (2016) found that nearly no microplastics were detected in the discharge of a tertiary sewage treatment plant in Southern California, and the abundance of microplastics in the effluent of the secondary sewage treatment plant was also low (with an average of only one microplastic particle per 1.14 litres of effluent). In contrast, most microplastics were found in the primary treatment stage (oil skimming). Also, Murphy et al. ( 2017) investigated a large secondary sewage treatment plant in Glasgow, Scotland (daily capacity 260,954 m 3 ) and found that although the final removal rate of microplastics was as high as 98.41%, approximately 6.5 × 10 7 microplastic particles per day were still discharged into the receiving water, indicating that the sewage treatment plant was an important source of the microplastic pollution (Murphy et al., 2017). Therefore, the different operative conditions applied in each plant Journal Pre-proof such as clothing (grey water) constitutes a major contribution (Browne, 2015;Peng et al., 2017). When the process of washing clothes in a household washing machine was simulated in the laboratory, the drainage of the washing machine contained a large amount of fibre-like microplastics (Hernandez et al., 2017). When using detergent, the content of microplastics in the drainage of the washing machine was much higher than that of washing without detergent.Direct sources of microplastic pollution include discharge from sewage treatment plants (Browne, 2015), weathering and degradation of plastic waste in water bodies (Eerkes-Medrano et al., 2015), and terrestrial input from soil erosion or surface runoff (Horton et al., 2017).

        <p>For example, washing a five-year-old PET fleece jacket released microfibers with a 0.00111 weight percentage (wt%) (with no detergent); 0.00123 wt% (with detergent); and 0.00136 wt% (with detergent and softener), having the release of microfibers increased when detergent and detergent plus softener were used (10.8% and 22.5% increases respectively) (Pirc et al, 2016).For example, washing a five-year-old PET fleece jacket released microfibers with a 0.00111 weight percentage (wt%) (with no detergent); 0.00123 wt% (with detergent); and 0.00136 wt% (with detergent and softener), having the release of microfibers increased when detergent and detergent plus softener were used (10.8% and 22.5% increases respectively) (Pirc et al, 2016).</p>

        <p>In marine environments, properties of microplastics such as their small size and low-density result in transport over long distances, particularly via ocean currents (Ballent, et al., 2016;Cole et al., 2011). Their occurrences have been reported along the coasts of continents (Browne, 2015;Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014), in remote areas such as the central Atlantic Islands (Ivar do Sul and Costa, 2014), sub-Antarctic region (Eriksen et al., 2014), the Arctic (Obbard et al., 2014), and even in deep-sea habitats (van Cauwenberghe et al., 2015;Kanhai et al., 2019). The different units of concentration used throughout the research and within review papers hinders comparison between findings (Kang et al., 2018;Li et al., 2018). For example, recent review papers (e.g. van Cauwenberghe et al., 2015) tabulate research Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f findings with different units, which hinder comparison among the concentrations. Table 1 compiles recent studies that report microplastics in freshwater environments, and highlights that it difficult to compare the concentrations found by each study. In Table 1, authors present the average of the concentrations found by each study. According to the approximate average of plastic of 1 g•mL -1 and the size of particles, an estimation -C number per volume = C mass per volume / (d plastic x V plastic ) (where C corresponds to concentration; "d" corresponds to density and "V" corresponds to volume), -can be made to derive comparable concentration values from different studies using the same unit, i.e. number per volume. Thus, all values can be compared and analysed intuitively. It is noticeable that the concentration of microplastics in sediments is higher than that in water, this may be due to a combination of factors including their hydrophobic nature and density, and as a result, they tend to accumulate in sediments.In marine environments, properties of microplastics such as their small size and low-density result in transport over long distances, particularly via ocean currents (Ballent, et al., 2016;Cole et al., 2011).

        <p>From the data and map, one of the most striking studies is from the Great Lake Basin of North America, where the average abundance of microplastics floating on the surface was as high as 43,000 units km -2 (Eriksen et al., 2013). The greatest presence of microplastics in Europe, to the best of our knowledge, has been reported in Lake Geneva, Switzerland, reaching 48,146 units km -2 (Florian Faure, 2012). However, microplastic pollution in freshwater environments of Asia may be more serious than those from other parts of the world (Wu et al., 2018). Notably, Free et al. (2014) found microplastic contamination in the Journal Pre-proof surface water of Lake Hovsgol in northern Mongolia, Asia, with an average abundance of 20,264 units km -2 . As the geographical location of the region is remote, and the population is sparse, this study suggests that microplastic pollution here may be more influenced by runoff, monsoon rains and atmospheric fallout, among other factors. Concentrations and location of microplastics in recent monitoring studies (period 2011-2019) in the freshwater environment are compiled in Table 1. Microplastics detected in these studies include data from water and sediments, and different compositions (Table 1). 1), microplastic pollution of freshwater environments has been studied to a lesser extent, when compared with marine environments. However, microplastic contamination of freshwater environments has been found even in remote regions; although studies are limited, this suggests that microplastics are distributed in freshwater systems throughout the world. Therefore, more systems should be studied to fill the gap in our knowledge of the distribution of microplastic pollution in freshwater environments globally.From the data and map, one of the most striking studies is from the Great Lake Basin of North America, where the average abundance of microplastics floating on the surface was as high as 43,000 units km -2 (Eriksen et al., 2013).

Map of distribution of microplastics in freshwater systems (based on data in Table 1) available knowledge of their spatial and temporal distribution (Galgani, et al., 2013;Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). Most current methods to detect and monitor microplastics are time consuming and inadequate in identifying all particles (Galgani et al., 2013;Mendoza and Balcer, 2019). Challenges in the detection of microplastics primarily comprise three aspects:Fig. 1.

Challenges in the detection of microplastics primarily comprise three aspects:</p>
        <p>the ability to capture plastic particles from water or sediment samples; the separation of plastic fragments from other matter (organic and inorganic); and the identification of plastic types (Eriksen et al., 2013;Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012). Microplastics are not regularly monitored as there is a lack of understanding of their possible effects on humans (Wright and Kelly, 2017). For this reason, further research on the spectrum of microplastics in freshwater (i.e. size range, type, and effects of microplastics) is required.the ability to capture plastic particles from water or sediment samples; the separation of plastic fragments from other matter (organic and inorganic); and the identification of plastic types (Eriksen et al., 2013;Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012).

        <p>The sampling methods used for capturing microplastics have consisted of selective sampling the separation of microplastics. However, separating low-density microplastics, with diameters &lt; 500 µm, is still challenging (Imhof et al, 2012). Some methods may be able to overcome this difficulty however. For example, through the use of a dense fluid, the Munich Plastic Sediment Separator can isolate various sizes (1μm -1mm), types and density of microplastic particles in water (Imhof et al., 2012), and has been used in the analysis of microplastics in freshwater from Lake Calda (Italy) and made possible the identification of microplastics as small as 9 μm (Imhof et al., 2013). An effective way for separating microplastics from sediment involves washing samples with nitric acid, which led to an extraction efficiency of 93-98% (Claessens et al., 2013). A low-cost approach proposed used castor oil to separate microplastics from sea and river water. This method was found applicable for the extraction of microplastics larger than 300 μm. Methods for improving the separation of microplastics of all sizes and types are emerging and improving our ability to effectively sample and separate microplastics. As new methodology is still emerging, it is too early to reach a unified approach. weathering causes cracks on the surface of the plastic and can break particles into smaller pieces. Different morphologies of microplastics can be found in Fig. 2. The characterization of surface morphology needs to be conducted at a high magnification (50-10,000 times) (Wang et al., 2017a). For this reason, current methods employ scanning electron microscopy techniques (Aytan et al., 2016) such as scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDS), and environmental scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (ESEM-EDS). However, characteristics such as shape and colour still rely heavily on visual inspection, with tools such as fluorescence labelling that can be used to enhance the distinction between microplastics and environmental substrates in cases where they are difficult to distinguish. ). In addition, as a result of the reduction of light transmittance through microplastics, the use of an attenuated total reflectance crystal attached to the microscope (ATR-µFTIR) is preferred. This modality is affected by limited sensitivity however (Pico and Barcelo, 2019), and although it does not require sample treatment, the characterization of microplastics with this technique is still time consuming.The sampling methods used for capturing microplastics have consisted of selective sampling the separation of microplastics.

        <p>SEM-EDS (or ESEM-EDS) (Zhao et al., 2017) provide greater spatial resolution than µFTIR and µRaman imaging. Compared to the visualization of specimens (from ~10 µm in the case of optical microscopy), SEM modalities makes possible resolutions &gt; 1 nm (Busquets, 2017) at the same time as their inorganic compositional analysis is carried out by EDS. The qualitative analysis that they offer is very localised; hence the lack of homogeneity of the microplastic sample can become an issue if the goal is quantitative analysis. This is also problematic in the analysis of nanoparticles, and it can be overcome by characterizing a very high number of sites within every sample (Dudkiewicz et al., 2015).SEM-EDS (or ESEM-EDS) (Zhao et al., 2017) provide greater spatial resolution than µFTIR and µRaman imaging.

Additionally, there is currently no standardized reporting of microplastic concentrations, and as a result, information gained concerning microplastic pollution in freshwater environments cannot easily be comparedthis may be limiting further understanding of microplastic pollution and development of measures to control it.Studies on the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in freshwater environments remain very scarce, especially in Africa, South America and North Asia.

        <p>At present, research on the origin of microplastics is relatively mature. However, methods to extract microplastics, particularly fibres, from environmental samples such as freshwater and sediments, need further study. Moreover, the processes that transform primary microplastics into secondary particles as well as methods that prevent their decomposition and diffusion also need to be further understood.At present, research on the origin of microplastics is relatively mature.

Because of their special physical and chemical characteristics, microplastics are likely to adsorb micropollutants. Whether this will produce joint toxic effects on freshwater organisms or change the bioaccumulation and food chain transmission of other pollutants are among the key research questions to be studied.Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f present a mixture of pollutants.

        <p>In addition, there is no qualitative and quantitative method for detection of microplastics suitable for real time monitoring in wastewater treatment plants. For example, techniques such as µFTIR are expensive, while lower cost methods such as visual inspection are time consuming. Therefore, there is a large need for research that develops novel cost-effective qualitative and quantitative methods for accurate microplastic determination.In addition, there is no qualitative and quantitative method for detection of microplastics suitable for real time monitoring in wastewater treatment plants.

        <p>Regarding the effects of microplastics on organisms and humans, the process of ingestion from freshwater, and the harm caused by the various types and sizes of microplastics remains unclear; although it is accepted that the &lt;100µm fraction of microplastics are the most hazardous.Regarding the effects of microplastics on organisms and humans, the process of ingestion from freshwater, and the harm caused by the various types and sizes of microplastics remains unclear; although it is accepted that the &lt;100µm fraction of microplastics are the most hazardous.</p>
