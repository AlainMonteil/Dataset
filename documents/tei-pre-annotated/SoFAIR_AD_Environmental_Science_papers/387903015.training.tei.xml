        <p>In order to explore the environmental drivers of forest vulnerability to natural disturbances, data were collected for a set of climate, forest and landscape variables that were used as potential predictors in the vulnerability models. The variables were preliminarily selected based on published studies documenting their potential role in forest disturbances (step2.2 in Supplementary Fig. 1 and discussion in the main text). Selected variables can be static or dynamic. In the former case, one value was considered representative of the entire observational period. In the latter case, a time series with annual time step of the specific environmental variable was used. Dynamic variables can describe the conditions in the year of a given disturbance and/or lagged effects (e.g., anomalies in the years preceding the disturbance). We browsed for potentially useful datasets and selected the most suitable candidate for each environmental variable based on the following criteria:  Geographical coverage: global datasets were preferred over national or continental ones in order to avoid inconsistent data across Europe and the United States, which are the spatial domains of the reference disturbance databases.  Data consistency: datasets with transparent and consistent mapping and reporting methodologies.  Spatial resolution: highest possible.  Data update: most recent. The selected variables and datasets are detailed below, grouped per category: forest, climate and landscape features. Forest features  Above ground biomass (biomass). Biomass was derived from multiple Earth Observation data in the framework of the ESA's GlobBiomass project 1 . Data were provided at 100-meter spatial resolution and refer to the year 2010. Data source: https://globbiomass.org/products/global-mapping/. Temporal variations in biomass over the 2000-2017 period were reconstructed by integrating the static biomass map and the forest cover changes derived from the Global Forest Change (GFC) maps recorded at 30-meter spatial resolution from Landsat imagery 2 and available for the 2000-2017 period (see Methods). Data source: https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest.  Tree height. Tree height values were retrieved from 1-km spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired in 2005 by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) 3 .

        <p>the age distributions of plant functional types (PFT) on a 0.5-degree grid and represents the 2000-2010 period 4 . The mode of the distribution for each PFT was retrieved and then averaged using PFT-specific cover fractions as weights for RF runs in steps 8-10 (Supplementary Fig. 1). PFT-specific age maps were used for PFTspecific vulnerability models (step11 in Supplementary Fig. 1). Data source: https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.889943.  Leaf Area Index (LAI). Growing season averages of LAI were retrieved from MODIS Terra+Aqua data provided at 500-meter spatial resolution over the 2002-2017 period (MCD15A3H.006, data source: https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD15A3H.006). The growing season spans from June to September. Missing LAI values for years 2000-2001 were reconstructed from NDVI values by interpolation of a quadratic polynomial fitting function calibrated over the overlapping period 2002-2017. NDVI values were retrieved from MODIS Terra data at 250-meter spatial resolution over the 2000-2017 period (MOD13Q1.006, data source: https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MOD13Q1.006).  Tree density. Tree densities were retrieved from a database of predictive regression models that link tree density observed over a multitude of plots at global scale with spatially explicit information on climate, topography, vegetation characteristics, and anthropogenic land use 5 .

        <p> Annual cumulated precipitation (Pcum), annual average temperature (Tavg) and annual maximum temperature (Tmax). Pcum, Tavg and Tmax were retrieved from the TerraClimate dataset, which combines high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the WorldClim dataset with time-varying coarser data from CRU Ts4.0 and the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55) 6 . Pavg, Tavg and Tmax refer to the annual precipitation and temperature conditions during the disturbance year and were provided at ~4-km spatial resolution over the period 1979-2018. Data source: http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html.  Short-term average anomaly in cumulated precipitation (avg aPcum) and average temperature (avg aTavg). avg aPcum (avg aTavg) were quantified as the average of the annual anomalies in cumulated precipitation (average temperature) over a six-year time window [t-5,t], where t is the year of the disturbance occurrence. Annual anomalies in cumulated precipitation (average temperature) were computed as the difference between the annual cumulated precipitation (average temperature) and its climatological value over the period 1970-1990. Temperature and precipitation were retrieved from the TerraClimate database 6 at ~4-km spatial resolution over the period 1979-2018. Data source: http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html.  Long-term average cumulated precipitation (Long-term Pcum) and long-term average temperature (Long-term Tavg). Long-term Pcum (Long-term Tavg) was quantified as the average of annual cumulated precipitation (average temperature) over the period 1979-2018. Temperature and precipitation are retrieved from the TerraClimate 6 database at ~4-km spatial resolution over the period 1979-2018. Data source: http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html.  Annual moisture index (MI). MI was quantified as the minimum of the seasonal MIs in a year, which were derived as (seasonal cumulated precipitation)/(seasonal maximum temperature + 30). The approach is based on a modified version of the De Martonne index 7 , where the constant 30 at the denominator is introduced to avoid negative values in cold climates. Temperature and precipitation were retrieved from the TerraClimate 6 database at ~4-km spatial resolution over the period 1979-2018. Data source: http://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html.  Short-term average standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (avg SPEI). avg SPEI was quantified as the average of the annual 12-month SPEI computed over a six-year time window [t-5,t], where t is the year of the disturbance occurrence.

        <p>on the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. In order to characterize prolonged period of water stress conditions before the occurrence of a given disturbance, we first isolated the SPEI-12 ≤ -0.5 values and summed them (in absolute values) over the 12 monthly values. No positive SPEI-12 or just-negative (between -0.5 and 0) values have been included in the annual summed values. Input climate variables were derived from reanalysis data at 0.25° spatial resolution over the period 1979-2018. Data source: https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5.  Fire Weather Index (FWI). The FWI is composed of three moisture codes and three fire behaviour indices. The moisture codes describe the moisture content of three generalized fuel classes, while the behaviour indices represent the spread rate, fuel consumption and intensity of a fire if it were to start 9 . FWI calculations require measurements of temperature at 2m, relative humidity at 2m, and wind speed at 10m, daily snow-depth, and precipitation totaled over the previous 24 hours. FWI was provided from the Global Fire WEather Database (GFWED) at 0.5° spatial resolution over the 1980-2018 period. Fire danger is typically mapped in classes (very low, low, medium, high, very high and extreme) according to FWI values. In our study, we used as predictor the number of days within a year with FWI above the "high danger" level. Data source: https://data.giss.nasa.gov/impacts/gfwed/.  Annual maximum wind speed (Wind speed) and cumulated snow (Snow). Wind speed and Snow values were retrieved from the NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 project which uses a state-of-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform data assimilation 10 . Both annual maximum wind speed and cumulated snow were provided at 0.5° spatial resolution over the 1979-2018 period.
