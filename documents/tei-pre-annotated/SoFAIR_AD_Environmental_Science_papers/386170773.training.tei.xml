        <p>Here we analyze intensity data for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes 11 over the past 50 years and show that hurricanes decay has slowed, in direct proportion to a contemporaneous rise in the sea-surface temperature. 12 Thus, in the late 1960s, a typical hurricane lost ∼75% of its intensity in the first day past landfall; now, the corresponding decay is only ∼50%. We also show, using computational simulations, that warmer sea surface temperatures induce a slower decay by increasing the stock of moisture which a hurricane carries as it hits land. This 'storm moisture' constitutes a source of heat that is not considered in theoretical models of decay. [13][14][15] Additionally, we show that climate-modulated changes in hurricane tracks 16,17 contribute to the increasingly slow decay. Our findings suggest that as the world continues to warm, the destructive power of hurricanes will extend progressively farther inland.Here we analyze intensity data for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes 11 over the past 50 years and show that hurricanes decay has slowed, in direct proportion to a contemporaneous rise in the sea-surface temperature. 12 Thus, in the late 1960s, a typical hurricane lost ∼75% of its intensity in the first day past landfall; now, the corresponding decay is only ∼50%.

        <p>Hurricanes thrive on moisture. Moisture from warm tropical oceans fuels the intense winds of a hurricane heat engine. 2,3 In a warming world, the moisture supply is enhanced. Warmer oceans supply more moisture, and warmer air, owing to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, 18 holds more moisture. As a result, we expect that the maximum intensity a hurricane can achieve over its lifetime increases. 6,9 Indeed, as the world warms, the strongest hurricanes (which, compared with the weaker ones, are less affected by impeding factors, e.g., wind shear) are getting stronger, with the most pronounced intensification seen for the North Atlantic hurricanes. 8 Without moisture, hurricanes wither. A landfall severs 1,19,20 a hurricane from the ocean, its moisture source. Consequently, the intensity decays rapidly. (When the intensity drops below 33 m/s, the hurricane, per the Saffir-Simpson scale, 21 is termed a tropical storm; however, for simplicity, we refer to tropical storms also as hurricanes.) How might the hurricane decay rates change in a warming world? In contrast to the extensive studies of hurricanes over ocean, this question has attracted scant attention.Hurricanes thrive on moisture.

        <p>We study North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes (Fig. 1a) over 1967-2018 using the best-track database "Atlantic HURDAT2", 11 widely considered the most reliable database amongst all the ocean basins. (See Methods for further discussion on the data.) For each hurricane, we analyze the intensity, V , during the first day past landfall, the period over which the hurricane inflicts most of the destruction. Over this period, V decays exponentially: 4, 5 V (t) = V (0)e -t/τ , where t is the time past landfall and τ , the decay timescale, is a single parameter that characterizes the rate of decay. (After the first day, V (t) can no longer be characterized by a single parameter; see Methods.)We study North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes (Fig. 1a) over 1967-2018 using the best-track database "Atlantic HURDAT2", 11 widely considered the most reliable database amongst all the ocean basins.

        <p>For each landfall event, we compute τ using V (t); see Methods. From one event to another, the value of τ varies considerably. This value for any particular event is influenced by many factors, including non-climatic ones, such as the terrain underneath the hurricane. 4,5,22,23 To discern any potential signature of the climate on τ , we first analyze the distribution of τ at a multi-decadal timescale. In Fig. 1b, we plot the probability density and histogram of τ for two time periods, each spanning a quarter-century. In each period, the values of τ span a large range, signifying the influence of many factors on any individual event. But it is also clear that with time higher values of τ are preferentially realized.For each landfall event, we compute τ using V (t); see Methods.

        <p>Here we seek to understand the cause of this increase. We begin by examining the variations in τ at a multi-annual timescale. We average τ for all the landfall events in a given year and apply a 3-year smoothing, twice in a row, to this time series. (Because each value of τ in the time series is based on several events, this approach lessens the effects of non-climatic factors and random noise; at the same time, the smoothing can still preserve a sharp step response. 24 ) In Fig. 1c, we plot the resulting τ time series. As expected from Fig. 1b, τ increases with time. Further, the increase is noticeably non-monotonic: the τ time series undulates about a linearly increasing trend.

        <p>We next examine whether both the trend and multi-annual variability in the decay rate may depend on climate. As a proxy for the climate, we first analyze the sea-surface temperature, SST, using the 'HadISST' database. 12 We average the SST in time over the hurricane season, June-November, and in space over a region abutting the coastal area of landfall (Fig. 1a), and, finally, smooth using the same procedure as for the τ time series. In Fig. 1d, we plot the resulting SST vs. year, and in Fig. 1e, we superpose the τ time series and the SST time series. Notably, like the τ time series, the SST time series also undulates about a linearly increasing trend-and does so in consonance with the τ time series, with correlation r = 0.73 (Fig. 1e,f).We next examine whether both the trend and multi-annual variability in the decay rate may depend on climate.

        <p>The foregoing analysis shows that τ and SST are reasonably well-correlated on multi-annual timescales. Next, using computational simulations, we turn our attention to the causality that underlies this correlation. We simulate landfalling hurricanes using Cloud Model 1 (CM1), a three-dimensional, non-hydrostatic, non-linear, time-dependent computational model that has been widely used to study the dynamics of idealized hurricanes; 23,[25][26][27] see Methods. First, we simulate and contrast the fate of four hurricanes that are first allowed to develop over a warm ocean under identical conditions except for the SST (and the attendant environmental sounding). That is, SST is the sole control parameter in the simulations. The hurricanes intensify at different rates over the oceans. The warmer the ocean, the greater the moisture supply and, consequently, the faster the intensification (Fig. 2a). When their intensities reach ≈60 m/s, a category 4 hurricane per the Saffir-Simpson scale, 21 the hurricanes make a complete landfall: we instantaneously turn off the moisture flux throughout the bottom surface of the hurricanes. 19,20 Thereafter, we again subject the hurricanes to identical conditions.The foregoing analysis shows that τ and SST are reasonably well-correlated on multi-annual timescales.

        <p>Although the intensity at landfall is the same for all four hurricanes, their decay past landfall carries a clear signature of their development over the ocean prior to the landfall (Fig. 2a). The intensities of the hurricanes that developed over warmer oceans decay at a slower rate. In other words, echoing the field observations, τ increases with SST (Fig. 2b). But, unlike the field observations, where many factors can affect the decay, here we can unambiguously attribute the changes in τ to the attendant difference in SST.Although the intensity at landfall is the same for all four hurricanes, their decay past landfall carries a clear signature of their development over the ocean prior to the landfall (Fig. 2a).

        <p>Now we discuss how the SST affects the decay. Central to our considerations is the role of moisture. At this juncture, it may be instructive to consider landfall of real hurricanes for which an active source of moisture past landfall is immediately evident. At the official beginning of a landfall, the center of a hurricane moves over land. But the moisture supply still persists as roughly half of the hurricane lies over ocean. This supply continually and rapidly wanes, becoming negligible ∼3.5 hr past landfall (see Methods). This timescale is but a fraction of the period over which we analyze the field observations. Thus, the causal link between the SST and the decay may not stem, for the most part, from this moisture supply; also see the later discussion on translation For t &lt; 0, the hurricanes develop over warm oceans; the different colors represent different SST. At t = 0, the hurricanes make landfall with V ≈ 60 m/s (also see Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). The solid lines correspond to the moist simulations and the plus symbols to the dry simulations. (In the text, we discuss the dry simulations in the context of how the storm moisture and SST affect the decay; in Methods, we discuss the dry simulations in the context of how the hurricane size may affect the decay.) (b) τ vs. SST. Note that the values of τ are larger than those in Fig. 1c; these differences stem from the simplified setup we use for the simulations (see Methods). (c) Rainfall vs. SST. This is the total rainfall accumulated inside the radius of 100 km and over the first two days past landfall. The qualitative trend in total rainfall is not sensitive to the choice of averaging radius or time period. speed. More starkly, in the simulated landfalls, this moisture supply is absent, and yet the effect of the SST on the decay is apparent.Now we discuss how the SST affects the decay.

        <p>To proceed, we turn our attention from an active source of moisture to one that may not be immediately evident: the 'storm moisture,' which is the moisture stocked in a hurricane during its passage over ocean and carried past landfall. We test its role by pairing each of the four simulated hurricanes discussed above with a partner. At the moment of landfall, the paired hurricanes are identical-i.e., the same velocity field, the same pressure field, the same temperature field-save for one aspect. We remove the moisture (in all phases: vapor, liquid, and ice) in the partner hurricanes. Thereafter, we evolve these dry hurricanes over land subject to the exact same conditions as their moist counterparts.To proceed, we turn our attention from an active source of moisture to one that may not be immediately evident: the 'storm moisture,' which is the moisture stocked in a hurricane during its passage over ocean and carried past landfall.

        <p>In Fig. 2a, we plot the decay for the four pairs of hurricanes. The causal role of storm moisture is now clear. The dry hurricanes decay at a notably faster rate compared with their moist partners-the storm moisture slows the decay of the moist hurricanes. Moreover, the decay rates of the dry hurricanes, unlike those of the moist hurricanes, are unaffected by their development over ocean. Indeed, the decay for the four dry hurricanes is indistinguishable. Devoid of storm moisture, SST exerts no influence on the decay of dry hurricanes. On the other hand, for moist hurricanes, the higher the SST, the greater the stock of the storm moisture, and, consequently, the slower the decay. We conclude that the storm moisture furnishes the causal link between τ and SST. A complementary aspect of this link is well known 9,28,29 -because the enhanced storm moisture eventually precipitates as rain, the rainfall from hurricanes increases with increase in the SST (Fig. 2c).In Fig. 2a, we plot the decay for the four pairs of hurricanes.

        <p>Translation speed: The translation speed of hurricanes can slow down in a warming world. 30,31 As a hurricane moves over land, a slower translation speed-specifically, its coastline-perpendicular component-allows the supply of moisture from ocean for a longer time, enhancing the storm moisture and thus promoting a slower decay past landfall. To test this potential effect, we compute the time series of the coastline-perpendicular translation speed, v t cos θ, for the landfalling hurricanes in our study (see Methods). From the plot of v t cos θ vs. year, we note there is no significant change (at 95% CI) over the past half-century (Fig. 3a), and from the plot of τ vs. v t cos θ, we note there is no significant relationship (at 95% CI) between the two (Fig. 3b). This analysis suggests that the observed increase in τ over the past half-century is unlikely to be linked with the translation speed. However, for ocean basins or time periods where there is a pronounced slowdown in v t cos θ, its influence on τ may become discernible.Translation speed: The translation speed of hurricanes can slow down in a warming world. 30,31 As a hurricane moves over land, a slower translation speed-specifically, its coastline-perpendicular component-allows the supply of moisture from ocean for a longer time, enhancing the storm moisture and thus promoting a slower decay past landfall.

        <p>Hurricane tracks: The tracks of hurricanes can systematically shift in a warming world. 32,33 The track changes can effect changes in the decay by subjecting the landfalling hurricanes to regions of distinct τ . The regional variation can stem from factors such as the terrain 4,5,20 or the coastline shape. 34 To test for track changes and their potential effect on τ , we first consider if, similar to the poleward shift in the latitude of hurricane lifetime maximum intensity, 35 there is We also show error bars for τ (which correspond to ±1 s.e.m.) and list the fraction of events corresponding to each region and time period. The number of events for regions E and W are, respectively, 4 and 22 (over 1967-1992) and 13 and 32 (over 1993-2018). also a poleward shift in the latitude of the landfall events in our study (see Methods). We find no significant change (at 95% CI) in the landfall latitude over the past half-century and no significant relationship (at 95% CI) between τ and landfall latitude (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).Hurricane tracks: The tracks of hurricanes can systematically shift in a warming world. 32,33 The track changes can effect changes in the decay by subjecting the landfalling hurricanes to regions of distinct τ .

        <p>Turning our attention from poleward shift, next we note that studies 16,17 of North Atlantic hurricanes report an eastward shift in their tracks. Specifically, as the climate warms, the fraction of hurricanes that make landfall on the US East Coast increases while the fraction of hurricanes that make landfall on the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean decreases. (The corresponding tracks, based on their shapes, are termed, respectively, "recurvers" and "straight movers.") To test if the landfall events in our study also manifest a similar trend, we divide the events into two regions, region E and region W (Fig. 3c), and two (quarter-century long) time periods. We find that the fraction of the events indeed shifts towards region E with time (Fig. 3d). Further, in any given time period, the decay in region E is slower than the decay in region W (Fig. 3d), as has also been noted previously 22,36 (but the precise causes of this regional variation remain unclear). It follows that the track changes preferentially increase the fraction of the events that correspond to a slower decay and therefore contribute to an increase in τ with time. By computing the increase in τ resulting from track changes and from SST increase separately, we estimate their relative contributions to be, respectively, ∼21% and ∼79%; see Methods.Turning our attention from poleward shift, next we note that studies 16,17 of North Atlantic hurricanes report an eastward shift in their tracks.

        <p>In summary, we have shown that over the past 50 years the value of τ for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes has increased by 94%. This increase is primarily fueled by the enhanced stock of storm moisture supplied by warmer oceans. An additional contribution stems from the climate-modulated changes in the tracks of the hurricanes. Unlike the effect of enhanced moisture, which invariably slows the decay, the effect of track changes is tied to the regional differences in the values of τ where the hurricanes make landfall. For North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes, our analysis suggests that the effect of the eastward shift in the tracks has been consonant with the effect of the contemporaneous SST increase.In summary, we have shown that over the past 50 years the value of τ for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes has increased by 94%.

        <p>As potentially promising topics for future work, we suggest: (1) study of other factors (e.g, extratropical interactions; see Methods) that may affect the decay; (2) study of landfalling hurricanes from other ocean basins (see Methods for a note of caution regarding the reliability of global data). Further, our findings call attention to the critical role of storm moisture in the dynamics of decay. However, the prevailing theoretical models of decay [13][14][15] treat a landfalling hurricane as a dry vortex which decays due to the frictional drag with the land underneath. Lacking moisture, these non-thermodynamic models cannot furnish any link between the climate and the decay. We submit that including moist thermodynamics as an essential component of a theoretical model of decay may help elucidate the key processes that underly the intricate dynamics of decay.As potentially promising topics for future work, we suggest: (1) study of other factors (e.g, extratropical interactions; see Methods) that may affect the decay; (2) study of landfalling hurricanes from other ocean basins (see Methods for a note of caution regarding the reliability of global data).

Even when the intensity at landfall remains the same (see, e.g., Extended Data Fig. 2c), owing to the slower decay regions far inland face increasingly intense winds (accompanied by heavy rainfall). Consequently, the incurred economic toll keeps soaring. This factor may shed new light on a puzzling trend. For over a century, the frequency and intensity of landfalling hurricanes have remained roughly unchanged, 9,37,38 but their inflation-adjusted economic losses have steadily increased. 37,38 It has been argued 37,38 that this increase stems entirely from societal factors (the growth in coastal population and wealth), with the warming climate playing no role. We submit that this accounting is possibly missing the costs tied to the slower decay of the hurricanes in a warming world. Finally, for hazard planning, we call attention to inland regions-they are less prepared for hurricanes than their coastal counterparts and therefore are more vulnerable to the damages from the slowly-decaying hurricanes.Last, we note that our findings have direct implications for the damages inflicted by landfalling hurricanes in a warming world.

        <p>Last, we note that the methods used to estimate the best-track value of V have steadily improved over time. For inland data, the most important of these changes is the increase in the density of weather stations. Because a denser sampling improves the odds of finding the true maximum wind speed, the recorded V gets biased towards higher values with time. Note, however, that we compute τ not using the value of V but of the ratio V (t)/V (t 1 ). If we denote the bias in V by δV , the resulting bias in this ratio can be estimated as δV (t)/V (t) -δV (t 1 )/V (t 1 ). Consequently, τ is less sensitive to the bias than V . In particular, if δV ∝ V (see, e.g., Ref. 42 ), then there is no effect of the bias on τ . While we expect that the bias does not significantly affect the τ time series, with the available data it is very difficult to precisely quantify the effect. Further, if there are appreciable differences in the methods used to estimate the different V (t) for any event, its effect should also be considered. Future studies may seek to precisely quantify how changes in the methods of estimating V may affect the τ time series.Last, we note that the methods used to estimate the best-track value of V have steadily improved over time.

        <p>We judge the relationship between two variables to be statistically significant if the two-sided, 95% CI of their slope from linear regression excludes zero (see, e.g., Ref. 30 ). In computing the CI, we adjust the degrees of freedom, d.f., if the time series of either of the variables has serial correlation (which we test using the Dublin-Watson test). Specifically, first we compute the decorrelation timescale from the autocorrelation of the residuals (see, e.g., Ref. 43 ). For example, the τ time series is not significantly autocorrelated after 2 yr (Extended Data Table. 3b). Taking its decorrelation timescale as 3 yr, we then compute the effective d.f. as n/3 -2 = 15, where n = 52 is the sample size. Using the effective d.f., we compute the CI.

        <p>We estimate the timescale of completing landfall-from when the center of a hurricane moves over land to when the supply of the moisture from the ocean underneath becomes negligible-using a simple model of landfall: in larger hurricanes. [49][50][51] (In real hurricanes, however, the relationship between SST and hurricane size is more complex. 51 ) Indeed, in our simulations, the hurricane size increases with SST-as SST increases from 300 K to 303 K, the corresponding RMW increases from 18.2 km to 22.5 km (Extended Data Fig. 6). To test if the hurricane size directly affects the decay, we consider dry hurricanes (Fig. 2a). At landfall, the size of these hurricanes, just like their moisture-laden counterparts, increases with SST. And yet, their decay past landfall is indistinguishable. This suggests that the hurricane size may not play a discernible role in influencing the decay.

        <p>In the first period, τ = 28.4 hr for region E and 19.9 hr for region W. The respective fractions of the events are 15.4% and 84.6%. From the first to the second period, the value of τ in both regions increases (36.2 hr in region E and 25.2 hr in region W). The increase may be attributed to the contemporaneous increase in the regional SSTs. Had the hurricane tracks remained unchanged, the fraction of events would have remained the same. In this scenario, we can compute the overall τ resulting from SST increase as the weighted average 15.4% x 36.2 hr + 84.6% x 25.2 hr = 26.9 hr.In the first period, τ = 28.4 hr for region E and 19.9 hr for region W.

As a result, the contribution of region E increases, and the overall τ becomes 28.4 hr.

        <p>The relative contributions of SST increase and track changes on τ may also be estimated using a different approach: partial correlation. 53 If we do not divide the events into distinct regions, we can study the effect of the track changes at a multi-annual timescale. We compute the longitude time series for the centroids of the event locations by following the same procedure as we employed for the latitude time series. In accord with the above analysis, the longitude time series shows a significant eastward shift (at 95% CI) over the past half-century (Extended Data Fig. 3c).The relative contributions of SST increase and track changes on τ may also be estimated using a different approach: partial correlation. 53 If we do not divide the events into distinct regions, we can study the effect of the track changes at a multi-annual timescale.

And, as we have discussed in the manuscript, there is a significant relationship (at 95% CI) between τ and SST; correlation = 0.73 (Fig. 1f). Finally, longitude and SST are not independent-there is a significant relationship (at 95% CI) between them; correlation = -0.59 (Extended Data Table 2). To estimate the relative contributions of SST and tracks, we use the aforementioned values of correlations and find the partial correlation between τ and longitude (with SST held constant) = -0.34 (with P-value &lt; 10 -4 ) and the partial correlation between τ and SST (with longitude held constant) = 0.57 (with P-value ≈ 10 -2 ). Thus, in accord with the analysis of Fig. 3d, the relative magnitudes of the two partial correlations suggest that the primary contribution to the increase in τ stems from the SST increase, with an additional contribution from the track changes. Also note that the τ -longitude relationship, unlike the τ -SST relationship, is not significant (at 95% CI) when both variables are detrended (Extended Data Table 2).

        <p>More broadly, an extratropical interaction can affect the decay without an extratropical transition. Consider, for example, the interaction with the jet stream. A recent analysis 55 showed that, over the past 4 decades, the vertical shear attendant to the North Atlantic jet stream has been increasing, which, in turn, is caused by changes in the climate. If a landfalling hurricane interacts with the jet stream, the increased wind shear will cause its intensity to decay rapidly. The overall effect on τ will be mediated by the details of the interaction, which are complex and difficult to study.

        <p>We analyze field data of North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes from the best-track database 11 Atlantic HURDAT2. This database provides the hurricane intensity and other parameters every 6 hours. We focus on the time period 1967-2018; we do not consider the pre-1967 data because they are less reliable. 4,39 In this period, we study all the "landfall events" (meaning, each time a hurricane makes landfall; a single hurricane may have multiple landfalls) that meet two criteria.We analyze field data of North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes from the best-track database 11 Atlantic HURDAT2.

        <p>First, at the first inland data point, V ≥ 33 m/s, the minimum intensity for "hurricane wind" per the Saffir-Simpson scale. 21 Second, there are at least four continuous inland data points (this excludes the hurricanes whose stay over land is less than one day). (We determine the inland data using the 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> function land or ocean. 40 ) Applying these criteria yields 75 events. Of those, we exclude one event (Hurricane Georges's 1998 landfall over Cuba) where the intensity increased instead of decaying. Further, to prevent the statistics to be skewed by outliers, we exclude 3 events where the value of the decay timescale, τ , was abnormally large (&gt;2 s.d. above the mean value; Extended Data Fig. 2a). (Including these outliers does not qualitatively affect the results; Extended Data Fig. 2b.) By excluding these 4 events, our study comprises 71 events.

        <p>For better statistics, it would be advantageous to consider landfalling hurricanes from all the ocean basins. The intensity data from the different ocean basins, however, differ widely in reliability. 8,41 Collating data from the different basins, therefore, can introduce large noise that may obscure a climatic signature.

        <p>To simulate the effect of global warming, we change the SST and the attendant environmental sounding (the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity; these profiles are based on measurements 44 over the North Atlantic ocean during the hurricane seasons of 1995-2002). The actual change in the sounding in a warming climate can be complex, but, to focus on the salient aspects, here we follow Ref. 6 and consider a simplified scenario. We modify the sounding by shifting its temperature profile (uniformly at all altitudes) to match the change in the SST and changing its humidity profile so that the relative humidity profile remains the same. 6,44 All other parameters in the sounding are kept unchanged.To simulate the effect of global warming, we change the SST and the attendant environmental sounding (the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity; these profiles are based on measurements 44 over the North Atlantic ocean during the hurricane seasons of 1995-2002).

        <p>To simulate a complete landfall, we set the coefficient of enthalpy, C e , equal to zero. 19,20 This turns off the flux of moisture (and sensible heat) from throughout the bottom surface of the hurricane. For simplicity, we keep all the other simulation parameters the same as for the hurricane over the ocean.To simulate a complete landfall, we set the coefficient of enthalpy, C e , equal to zero. 19,20 This turns off the flux of moisture (and sensible heat) from throughout the bottom surface of the hurricane.

        <p>We calculate τ using V (t). We follow the same procedure as for the field data, except now we consider the first two days past landfall. (Calculating τ using V (t) over the first day past landfall yields comparable results.) This is because whereas in the field data V (t) decays as V (0)e -t/τ over the first day, the V (t) for the simulation data is in good accord with the exponential model over the first two days; as we discuss presently, this difference is due to the simple model of surface drag in Consider an axisymmetric hurricane moving from ocean to land with a constant translation speed v t and at an angle θ (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We denote the hurricane's effective radius of moisture supply 45,46 by R o ; for any radial location r &gt; R o , the supply of the moisture from the ocean underneath is negligible. (A typical value of R o is ∼ 3R, where R is the radius of maximum wind, RMW.) For r ≤ R o , we approximate the hurricane's surface-wind profile, v(r), as the modified Rankine vortex: 47,48We calculate τ using V (t).

        <p>Due to the shrinking contact area between the bottom of the landfalling hurricane and the ocean underneath, the moisture supply wanes over time. For the model outlined above, the timescale of completing landfall depends on the values of R o , R, v t , θ, and τ . (It also depends on the shape of the coastline; 22,34 for simplicity, here we consider a straight coastline.) For the typical values of R o = 100 km, R = 30 km, v t = 5 m/s, cos θ = 0.9 (Extended Data Fig. 1f), and τ = 25 hr (the average value for North Atlantic landfalling hurricanes over 1967-2018), the timescale for the enthalpy flux to drop to 10% of its value over the ocean is about 3.5 hr (Extended Data Fig. 7b).Due to the shrinking contact area between the bottom of the landfalling hurricane and the ocean underneath, the moisture supply wanes over time.
