        <p>Background and aims: Since its emergence in the mid-20th century, invasion biology has matured into a productive research field addressing questions of fundamental and applied importance. Not only has the number of empirical studies increased through time, but also has the number of competing, overlapping and, in some cases, contradictory hypotheses about biological invasions. To make these contradictions and redundancies explicit, and to gain insight into the field's current theoretical structure, we developed and applied a Delphi approach to create a consensus network of 39 existing invasion hypotheses.</p>
        <p>The resulting network was analysed with a link-clustering algorithm that revealed five concept clusters (resource availability, biotic interaction, propagule, trait and Darwin's clusters) representing complementary areas in the theory of invasion biology. The network also displays hypotheses that link two or more clusters, called connecting hypotheses, which are important in determining network structure. The network indicates hypotheses that are logically linked either positively (77 connections of support) or negatively (that is, they contradict each other; 6 connections).</p>
        <p>The network visually synthesizes how invasion biology's predominant hypotheses are conceptually related to each other, and thus, reveals an emergent structure -a conceptual map -that can serve as a navigation tool for scholars, practitioners and students, both inside and outside of the field of invasion biology, and guide the development of a more coherent foundation of theory. Additionally, the outlined approach can be more widely applied to create a conceptual map for the larger fields of ecology and biogeography.</p>

        <p>The first author's grandfather was a master electrician working for the city of Munich, Germany, whose daily work consisted of repairing streetlights and other electrical devices for public use. One of his most impressive skills was his ability to intimately recall the details of every place in his district. By combining his knowledge with that of co-workers familiar with other districts, one could have created a complete map of the city that would allow anyone to confidently navigate its streets. In many ways, a research field is quite similar to a city where its major questions and hypotheses represent subunits comparable to city districts. Such subunits can be represented on a map, whether of a city or a research field, the latter allowing scientists inside and outside of the field to better orientate themselves and navigate their own research interests. Such a map would also be useful for students, teachers, policymakers and managers, as it would allow them to efficiently identify the elements of science most pertinent to their interests and goals. Some previous conceptual maps of science take the form of networks, and cover multiple disciplines; that is, they chart science as a whole and show how different disciplines relate to each other (Börner, 2010(Börner, , 2015)). These maps usually do not focus on the theory of any one discipline, and thus, do not represent the myriads of hypotheses and concepts of each research field. Given that concepts and hypotheses form the backbone of scientific inquiry, we posit that it is useful to simultaneously create conceptual maps within research disciplines to visualize the relationships among key hypotheses (Jeschke, 2014). Conceptual maps identify the degree to which hypotheses are similar, competing or contradictory, and use this information to aggregate them into broader clusters.</p>
        <p>Conceptual maps in the form of networks can be particularly useful for disciplines with many hypotheses, where even researchers within the field tend to be restricted to specific research silos and are thereby increasingly unaware of similar hypotheses in the field. An example of such a discipline is invasion biology. Since the emergence of the field with the publication of Charles Elton's book</p>
        <p>The ecology of invasions by animals and plants in 1958 and sustained research programmes developed in the 1990s (Richardson &amp; Pyšek, 2008), it has accumulated an impressive number of hypotheses and concepts (see Table 1 for references and descriptions of the hypotheses). A recent online survey indicated that many invasion biologists appear to be knowledgeable about hypotheses and concepts they are directly working with, but do not demonstrate a consistent understanding of the relationship among these and other concepts in the field (Enders, Hütt, &amp; Jeschke, 2018). Some invasion hypotheses are more popular in particular taxa or subfields of invasion biology than in others. For example, analysing over 1,000 studies concerning 10 invasion hypotheses, Jeschke and Heger (2018: table 17.2) found that four of these hypotheses are predominantly addressed by studies on non-native animals. Of the studies addressing the island susceptibility hypothesis, 65% focused on non-native vertebrates (see also Jeschke et al., 2012); of the studies addressing the limiting similarity hypothesis, only 3% focused on vertebrates and 94% on plants. Cross-taxonomic studies are rare for most hypotheses, with invasional meltdown being a notable exception (Jeschke et al., 2012). This hypothesis has also been addressed by a substantial number of studies in aquatic habitats (37%), whereas other hypotheses have been predominantly investigated in terrestrial habitats: of the nine other hypotheses analysed by Jeschke and Heger (2018: table 17.3), the average proportion of terrestrial studies was 84%. The overall clear pattern is that different invasion hypotheses are investigated within different taxonomic groups and different habitats. In addition, the hypotheses represent different perspectives on biological invasions: some focus on ecosystem properties (e.g., empty niche hypothesis), others on interactions with humans (e.g., propagule pressure hypothesis), biotic interactions (e.g., enemy release hypothesis) or species traits (e.g., ideal weed hypothesis).</p>
        <p>Given that many researchers and conservationists working in the various subfields of invasion biology no longer appear to have a good overview of the general discipline's major theoretical ideas (as indicated by Enders et al., 2018), a network of concepts, representing a conceptual map of invasion biology, would provide much-needed orientation and navigation. Because maps can take the form of networks, we use both terms in a similar way: network is the more technical term and better describes how the map is methodologically constructed, whereas the term map focuses on the purpose as a navigation tool.</p>
        <p>Several approaches have previously been used to visualize a network of invasion hypotheses, although they have some limitations.</p>
        <p>These attempts build on past work that highlighted commonalities among invasion hypotheses but did not visualize them (Catford, Jansson, &amp; Nilsson, 2009). First, Enders et al. ( 2018) created a network by asking researchers which hypotheses they knew best.</p>
        <p>This approach assumes that if many researchers state that they know a given pair of hypotheses very well, these hypotheses probably have something in common, and can thus be connected in a network. This is a 'black box' approach, as it is unclear why researchers often know a certain pair of hypotheses well and thus what a connection between hypotheses really means.</p>
        <p>Second, Enders and Jeschke (2018) assessed the conceptual similarity of hypotheses by classifying which factors are highlighted as most important for the invasion success of non-native species.</p>
        <p>The resulting table characterizing the hypotheses (based on Catford et al., 2009) was then used to create a network showing conceptual overlaps. A weakness of this approach is that the classification was based on the assessments of very few experts, namely the authors of Catford et al. (2009;n = 3) and Enders and Jeschke (2018</p>
        <p>Finally, Enders, Havemann, and Jeschke (2019) applied a bibliometric approach to create a network of invasion hypotheses. In their network, two hypotheses are connected if key publications featuring these hypotheses are frequently cited together. Co-citation analysis was recently also applied by Trujillo and Long (2018) who created a sequence of nested co-citation networks (although these are not hypothesis networks). The application of co-citation analysis for creating hypothesis networks has three main limitations: (a) a publication may be cited for reasons other than the hypothesis that it refers to;</p>
        <p>(b) it is not possible to discriminate among hypotheses that support one another and those that contradict one another; and (c) especially in large, complex fields, research areas that are logically connected are not always bibliographically connected (Swanson, 1986).</p>
        <p>To overcome the limitations of these approaches, we present a novel consensus approach based on the Delphi method to create a network of invasion hypotheses that capitalizes on the expertise of a group of invasion biologists who work on different topics and various taxonomic groups and habitats. The approach can be generally applied to any research field; thus, invasion biology is used as a case example here. In a Delphi method, the opinions of a group of experts converge towards a consensus in several steps during which the experts revise their opinion based on an anonymized summary of all experts' opinions (Häder &amp; Häder, 2000). In the resulting consensus network, we identified hypothesis clusters by applying a state-ofthe-art link-clustering algorithm.</p>
        <p>Our approach to creating a consensus network of invasion hypotheses consists of nine steps (Steps 4 to 8 represent the Delphi approach; Figure 1). In Step 1, a group of 29 experts in invasion biology were assembled to ensure a breadth of experience, wide taxonomic knowledge and geographic scope. Given the high level of expertise needed for the task, of the 29 experts, 15 were senior scientists (52%), 10 postdocs or on a similar level (34%) and 4 were TA B L E 1 List of 39 common invasion hypotheses and how they were defined for this study [adapted from Catford et al.

        <p>Step 5, all participants were asked to re-inspect hypothesis pairs with inconclusive entries (that was the case for 52 hypothesis pairs) and to individually send their revised network or matrix to the moderators.</p>
        <p>In Step 6, the moderators calculated an overall hypothesis network based on the links among hypotheses, using the

            <rs type="version">3.1.0</rs> (

            <rs type="software">igraph</rs>' (Csardi &amp; Nepusz, 2006) (see below for details) and shared it with all participants.
        </p>
        <p>In Step 7, the participants inspected the overall network, and those who disagreed with any element explained their reason for this disagreement by sending an individual e-mail to the moderators who then shared the collected and anonymized feedback with the group.</p>
        <p>In Step 8, participants inspected their assessments again based on this feedback and sent their final network or matrix to the moderators if any changes were made. All individual networks are provided in Supporting Information Table S1.</p>
        <p>In Step 9, the moderators calculated final values for the link between each pair of hypotheses (Supporting Information Table S1)</p>
        <p>and constructed the final hypothesis network.</p>
        <p>To reveal the inner structure of a network, it is helpful to group the nodes (in our case: the hypotheses) of the network into clusters.</p>
        <p>A common way of doing so is node clustering, for which various algorithms exist (Fortunato, 2010). We applied four established node-clustering algorithms which, however, led to different network clusters (see Supporting Information Appendix S1). These inconsistencies were largely due to the fact that some hypotheses did not seem to be part of any single cluster, but were instead bridging clusters. We therefore decided to apply a link-clustering method instead (Ahn, Bagrow, &amp; Lehmann, 2010;Evans &amp; Lambiotte, 2009), an approach that allows for nodes to be members of multiple clusters. Link clustering is thus more flexible than node clustering where each node can only be in one cluster (see Supporting Information Appendix S1 for details).</p>
        <p>Clusters of links induce node communities whereby the membership grade of each node to the community induced by link cluster L is given by the proportion of its internal links</p>
        <p>(see below for details). Because we assumed that pairs of similar hypotheses identified in one region of the network are independent of hypothesis pairs in other regions, we chose a local approach to link clustering, where each link set L is evaluated independently from the rest of the network (Havemann, Gläser, &amp; Heinz, 2017). Local link clustering allows for communities not only to overlap in boundary nodes, but also in inner nodes. One measure for evaluating link clusters is the escape probability of the link-node-link random walker. This random walker -introduced by Evans and Lambiotte ( 2009) -is the translation of the ordinary random walker into the world of link clustering.</p>
        <p>The walker starts from a link, goes randomly to one of its nodes, and then to one of the links of this node. If the escape probability is low, then L is a link set that is well separated from the rest of the network.</p>
        <p>The escape probability of a link-node-link random walker is given by the following equations (Havemann, Gläser, &amp; Heinz, 2019):</p>
        <p>in the minimum cost. After reaching a local minimum, we continued the search, because cost landscapes are rough, and we did not want to get trapped in a local minimum that is only a few steps away from a deeper one. After expanding link sets, we excluded links until we found the final hypothesis clusters with the lowest escape probability. Further information on this approach is provided in Havemann et al. (2017).</p>
        <p>The resulting consensus network included (a) five clusters covering 32 of the 39 hypotheses; (b) six connecting hypotheses acting as bridges between clusters (human commensalism, HC, connecting three clusters; and resource-enemy release, RER, increased resource availability, IRA, reckless invader, RI, biotic indirect effects, BID, and empty niche, EN, each connecting two clusters); and (c) one hypothesis not connected with any other hypothesis in the network (increased susceptibility, IS, with the closest connection with the polyploidy hypothesis, PO; link = .48; Supporting Information Table S1) (Figure 2).</p>
        <p>We named the five clusters the (a) 'biotic interaction cluster' accounting for nine full-member hypotheses (i.e., without connecting hypotheses), (b) 'Darwin's cluster' (seven full-member hypotheses), (c) 'trait cluster' (six full-member hypotheses), (d) 'propagule cluster' (six full-member hypotheses) and (e) 'resource availability F I G U R E 2 Network of 39 common hypotheses in invasion biology, clusters calculated with the local link-clustering algorithm (hypothesis names are abbreviated as in Table 1 where details on each hypothesis are provided). Colours indicate membership of hypotheses to concept clusters. The representation is simplified in that, for example, the node empty niche (EN) appears to be split into two equal parts, while it actually belongs slightly more in Darwin's cluster (6/11 = 55%) than in the resource availability cluster (5/11 = 45%); see Supporting Information</p>

        <p>cluster' (four full-member hypotheses) (Figure 2). The trait cluster is actually nested in Darwin's cluster (cf. Supporting Information Appendix S1), hence one could also consider Darwin's cluster to include 13 full-member hypotheses that are further separated into two sub-clusters. For simplicity, though, and because none of the other clusters includes sub-clusters, we do not usually discriminate between first-and second-level clusters here.</p>
        <p>Each of the five clusters we identified encapsulates a main explanation why a non-native species may become invasive (sensu Blackburn et al., 2011). The commonality among the hypotheses in the biotic interaction cluster is the role of interspecific (mostly negative) interactions in species invasion success. Most hypotheses in this cluster assume that natural enemies (i.e., predators, herbivores, parasites and pathogens) control species populations, so when a species is introduced to a new area, populations thrive because enemies are left behind. Similarly, Schulz, Lucardi, and Marsico (2019) recently offered a framework of hypotheses focusing on how enemies/ antagonists affect invasion success. The lack of specific enemies in the recipient location gives an advantage to non-native over native species (enemy release, ER) despite generalist enemies also reducing their performance. Some hypotheses in this cluster posit that enemy release allows non-native individuals to reallocate resources from defences against natural enemies towards growth, fitness and competitive ability (evolution of increased competitive ability, EICA;</p>
        <p>shifting defence hypothesis, SDH). Mutualistic interactions with native species (e.g., pollinators, seed dispersers, mycorrhiza) also increase invasion success (Richardson, Allsopp, D'Antonio, Milton, &amp; Rejmanek, 2000), whereas interspecific competition with the native species (reckless invader, RI) or a lack of mutualists (i.e., those missing compared to the invader's home range) impede it (missed mutualism, MM).</p>
        <p>The hypotheses in the resource availability cluster associate invasion success with invader access to resources, which is affected by abiotic and biotic conditions and their interaction (Catford et al., 2009 and references therein). The first three hypotheses (increased resource availability, IRA; disturbance, DS; opportunity windows, OW) centre on temporary increases in resource availability, which can result from a decline in resource uptake in the community and/ or an increase in supply. Increased resource availability (IRA) and disturbance (DS) focus on fluctuations through time, whereas opportunity windows (OW) considers fluctuations in both space and time (see also Davis, Grime, &amp; Thompson, 2000). High resource availability, even if only temporary, enables invader populations to become established, from which point they can continue to grow and spread. The dynamic equilibrium model (DEM) centres on interactions between disturbance and productivity, which collectively affect resource availability and strength of resource competition, and thus opportunities for invasion. While the underlying mechanism is arguably the same (sufficient resource availability), environmental heterogeneity (EVH) is phenomenological and pattern-based, unlike the first four process-based hypotheses. EVH essentially attributes invasion success to incomplete resource uptake by the resident community. This is because communities in ecosystems with high environmental heterogeneity are less likely to be saturated, such that associated resources remain unused (or under-used). These available resources provide ripe opportunities for (effectively competition-free) invasion by species having the appropriate niche. EVH is strongly linked with the empty niche hypothesis (EN; which follows Elton's rather than Hutchinson's niche concept, cf. Pulliam, 2000), a connecting concept between the resource availability cluster and Darwin's cluster (Figure 2).</p>
        <p>Many of the hypotheses in Darwin's cluster have an ecoevolutionary perspective on biological invasions, which highlights the importance of species' evolutionary legacies in shaping the outcome of biotic interactions that result from species introductions. This is true for the ecological imbalance (EIM) hypothesis, which focuses on the evolutionary characteristics of both the region that receives the non-native species and regions where that species is native. Another example is ecological naivety (ENA), which is also known as evolutionary naivety. Ecological niches are shaped evolutionarily, and many hypotheses in this cluster are related to species' niches, either that of the non-native species arriving in an ecosystem or that of the species assemblage composing the native community.</p>
        <p>Indeed, several of these hypotheses propose that non-native species could only establish and potentially become invasive if they can occupy niches different from those of the native species, a theoretical concept developed by Shea and Chesson (2002). In practice, niche similarity or divergence has been characterized by species' functional traits, given their link to resource acquisition, evolutionary fitness and ecosystem processes (Divíšek et al., 2018;Vidal-Garcia &amp; Keogh, 2017;Wang, Hu, Wang, Liu, &amp; Yu, 2018), or by species relatedness, assuming that species niches are conserved in phylogenies (Prinzing, Durka, Klotz, &amp; Brandl, 2001;Thuiller et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>In other words, the likelihood of a non-native species becoming invasive is, according to these hypotheses, related to dissimilarities in the non-native species' characteristics with respect to the recipient community, and thus, associated with their resource use in the new environment. Furthermore, the relationship between species evolution, niche space and species traits explains why we found the trait cluster to be nested in Darwin's cluster.</p>
        <p>The trait cluster includes six hypotheses that focus on traits to explain why a non-native species may become invasive. This is a topic of long-standing interest within invasion biology, from its very onset, as it is thought that certain species traits are associated with invasiveness (Baker, 1974;Capellini, Baker, Allen, Street, &amp; Venditti, 2015;Mahoney et al., 2015;Pyšek &amp; Richardson, 2007;van Kleunen, Weber, &amp; Fischer, 2010). The hypotheses included within this cluster consider traits that can help non-native species to generally become invasive (ideal weed, IW), to compete with native species (novel weapons, NW), or to adapt to the novel conditions found in their introduced ranges (adaptation, ADP; polyploidy hypothesis, PO; plasticity hypothesis, PH; habitat filtering, HF).</p>
        <p>Finally, the hypotheses in the propagule cluster relate the numbers of introduced non-native species or individuals to the probability that they will become invasive. The propagule pressure hypothesis (PP) operates at the population level and suggests that the likelihood of a non-native population being able to establish increases with the number of individuals of that species being introduced</p>
        <p>While clusters of hypotheses can reflect fertile areas of similar research questions, connecting hypotheses are nodes that apparently overlap with, or logically connect, two or more clusters. Thus, these nodes offer logical links between major areas of research within the field. For example, the increased resource availability (IRA) hypothesis connects the resource availability and biotic interaction clusters.</p>
        <p>The former cluster is concerned with changing conditions and opportunities, such as shifts in resource uptake and supply, whereas the latter cluster emphasizes the importance of a favourable biotic context in which enemies no longer constrain the population growth of the invader. In particular, non-native species must often co-opt limiting resources from native competitors in order to maintain population persistence; thus, the IRA hypothesis is linked to the biotic interaction cluster. Similarly, the human commensalism hypothesis (HC) logically connects to the trait cluster by recognizing the importance of trait plasticity and pre-adaptation for surviving human-mediated disturbances and land use (e.g., agriculture), and for exploiting human transportation systems. Human commensalism also implies greater opportunities for propagule dispersal, hence the link to the propagule cluster. Finally, human commensalism reflects the ability of successful invaders to opportunistically exploit human-mediated disturbance events -which promote enemy release and resource release via the loss of resident predators and competitors.</p>
        <p>To our knowledge, such connecting hypotheses have not been identified before. Thus, in addition to the largest hypothesis network created to date using a state-of-the-art method, another novel result of this study is the identification of hypotheses that connect hypothesis clusters, and thus, serve as conceptual bridges in invasion biology. Such conceptual bridges play a key role in advancing scientific goals, and an important extension of the work presented here will be to identify them also at the level of disciplines (in addition to the level of hypotheses shown here). For example, Jeschke (2014) outlined that the 'diversity-stability hypothesis which states that ecosystems with high biodiversity are more stable than ecosystems with low biodiversity' (p. 1,230) is a more general formulation of the biotic resistance hypothesis (BR) in invasion biology where 'stability' is resistance against non-native species. The same idea can be found in disease ecology in which 'stability' is resistance against pathogens (Lively, 2010;Sommer, 2005). Identifying more such connecting hypotheses will help us to better bridge research within and between research fields.</p>
        <p>Some papers previously categorized hypotheses and concepts in invasion biology (e.g., Catford et al., 2009;Chabrerie et al., 2019;Gurevitch, Fox, Wardle, Inderjit, &amp; Taub, 2011;Schulz et al., 2019) or visualized them in the form of networks (Enders et al., 2018(Enders et al., , 2019;;Enders &amp; Jeschke, 2018). Although useful for providing a first overview, these previous approaches to creating hypothesis networks in invasion biology had several limitations that were overcome by our consensus approach. In particular, here we assembled a fairly large and diverse group of experts constructing the consensus network who were offered the opportunity to discuss why they consider hypotheses to be logically linked, and they could differentiate between positive linkages, negative linkages or unlinked hypotheses. Another advantage to our approach here is that, unlike quantitative bibliometric approaches, it does not depend on a large literature database. Finally, our consensus approach reflects how the concepts are being currently used in practice, and presently perceived and interpreted by experts working in the field. This is in contrast to the bibliometric approach, which is based on historic citation patterns.</p>
        <p>The networks resulting from the consensus approach used in this paper and those from previous bibliometric approaches (see Enders et al., 2019) are quite similar; however, due to the outlined benefits of the consensus approach, we recommend this approach to create networks of hypotheses and concepts in a research field.</p>
        <p>Our hypothesis network visualizes the conceptual structure of invasion biology. It displays relationships among invasion hypotheses that can in turn be tested with empirical studies. A next step should be to offer both the network and empirical studies as interactive tools online. This output provides the opportunity to (a) bridge the gap between theoretical-conceptual and empirical work, and (b) offer a visual and user-friendly interface to explore the knowledge depth, gaps and redundancies of the field. In this way, it would be immediately visible which hypotheses are empirically supported under which circumstances, particularly when dividing the 39 hypotheses into more specific sub-hypotheses following the hierarchyof-hypotheses approach (Jeschke &amp; Heger, 2018). A first step in this direction is available at the website http://www.hi-knowl edge.org.</p>
        <p>Another helpful extension of the network will be to visualize taxonomic and habitat biases among the clusters and hypotheses.</p>
        <p>The clusters in our network provide a clear, simplified summary of the main mechanisms that, according to current theory, govern the introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species. The clustering highlights that the field is currently dominated by attention to antagonistic interactions between non-native and native species; it recognizes the stochastic nature of invasions through spatio-temporal variation in biotic and abiotic conditions (resource availability cluster), as well as in propagule supply and filtering (propagule cluster); and part of the foundation of the field is built upon venerable hypotheses arising from Darwin and Elton (cf. Table 1).</p>
        <p>This method could also be used to identify temporal trends in the concepts, that is, when hypotheses were proposed and coined, and We expect that in the future and with increasing research efforts focusing on the Anthropocene, the field will focus more on the role of humans (Kueffer, 2017) and how we can better integrate related, but still largely isolated research fields (Heger et al., 2019;Vaz et al., 2017). For the latter, the connecting hypotheses highlighted in this study will play an important role. Since the conceptual map presented here is a stepping stone towards the future of the field, it should be regularly revised and extended.</p>
        <p>Finally, the consensus approach outlined here can be applied to any research field. We strongly encourage its application particularly in disciplines where, as in invasion biology, there are so many hypotheses and concepts that it is hard to gain an overview without a navigation tool like a hypothesis network. Connecting an increasing number of hypothesis networks could facilitate cross-disciplinary research by revealing overlaps and joint ideas, enhancing the understanding of basic ideas and transfer of knowledge. A resulting growing atlas of knowledge could thus help address complex problems like multi-causality in biodiversity change (Sala et al., 2000;Settele et al., 2005), and to build a solid basis for tackling the current environmental crisis. Such an atlas would also reveal hypotheses and concepts that connect disciplines, helping researchers to find out if colleagues from another discipline have already come up with concepts and ideas to potentially solve challenges in their own field.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we call on researchers across scientific disciplines to create conceptual maps for their fields. Let's then connect these maps to jointly build an atlas of knowledge.</p>
