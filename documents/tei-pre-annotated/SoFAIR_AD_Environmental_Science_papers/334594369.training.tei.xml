        <p>Non-domestic buildings contribute 20% of the UK's annual carbon emissions. A contribution exacerbated by its ageing stock of which only 7% is considered new-build. Consequently, the government has set regulations to decrease the amount of energy take-up by buildings which currently favour deep energy retrofitting analysis for decision-making and demonstrating compliance. Due to the size and complexity of non-domestic buildings, identifying optimal retrofit packages can be very challenging. The need for effective decision-making has led to the wide adoption of artificial intelligence in the retrofit strategy design process. However, the vast retrofit solution space and high time-complexity of energy simulations inhibit artificial intelligence's application. This paper presents an energy performance prediction model for non-domestic buildings supported by machine learning. The aim of the model is to provide a rapid energy performance estimation engine for assisting multi-objective optimisation of non-domestic buildings energy retrofit planning. The study lays out the process of model development from the investigation of requirements and feature extraction to the application on a case study.

        <p>In the UK, Non-domestic building stock contributes roughly 20% of annual carbon emission [1]. The UK government has set a series of regulations to abate its gas emission by 29% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050. A great deal of the problem faced by the UK government and other countries is in existing buildings. In the UK as well as some European countries, the rate of replacing buildings is as low as 1% [2]. It is expected that at least 70% of existing buildings will be occupied in 2050 [3]. However, due to the non-domestic sector's inattentive response to the sustainability program, governments mediation for improvement of energy efficiency for this sector has intensified significantly [4].In the UK, Non-domestic building stock contributes roughly 20% of annual carbon emission [1].

        <p>Retrofit decision-making, particularly for complex buildings, remains a significant challenge for retrofit analysts [5,6], given the solution space is effectively unbounded. Decision-making may be further convoluted through legislative or voluntary constraints such as the private rented sector Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) seven-year payback exemption criterion [7]. In the case of MEES, retrofit packages which can be demonstrated will not negate initial capital expenditure within seven years can be removed from the compliance solution space.Retrofit decision-making, particularly for complex buildings, remains a significant challenge for retrofit analysts [5,6], given the solution space is effectively unbounded.

        <p>Therefore, a decision-making (DM) tool is imperative to propose appropriate retrofit technologies for each specific case [8]. Where there is more than one objective, Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO) methods have become the de facto approach in facilitating decision making and selecting suitable solutions for deep energy retrofits for more than a decade [9]. The majority of existing MOO tools heavily rely on computational energy simulation, where an optimisation script intermittently requests performance estimates from a Building Performance Simulation (BPS) tool such as EnergyPlus [10], 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> [11] and ESP-r [12] to produce energy-related performance indicators.
        </p>
        <p>However, despite significantly reducing the time necessary to identify near-optimal retrofit packages, the process and time intensity of such BPSs is highly prohibiting, especially when it comes commercial buildings due to their size and complexity [13,14].However, despite significantly reducing the time necessary to identify near-optimal retrofit packages, the process and time intensity of such BPSs is highly prohibiting, especially when it comes commercial buildings due to their size and complexity [13,14].</p>
        <p>As such, although AI techniques have been advanced in the last decade, the optimisation of non-domestic, particularly large-scale buildings, faces several challenges towards meeting modern energy standards. These issues are raised from the lack of interdisciplinary researches in this field.As such, although AI techniques have been advanced in the last decade, the optimisation of non-domestic, particularly large-scale buildings, faces several challenges towards meeting modern energy standards.

        <p>Furthermore, identification and preparation of meaningful and reliable data for modelling have been a primary concern. Due to the high labour and computational costs of energy simulations, neither the retrofit industry nor the stakeholders are willing to use these methods [15]. Thereby, those approaches are limited to academic case studies and partially optimisation of building characteristics [16,17,18,9]. Hence, achieving a comprehensive retrofit planning considering all available technologies and energy policies is not practically possible without a fast and stable energy performance emulator. Otherwise, the means of generating optimal solutions for massive commercial buildings with the development of MOO algorithm will remain exorbitant even for several sample cases.Furthermore, identification and preparation of meaningful and reliable data for modelling have been a primary concern.

        <p>Motivated by these gaps in the knowledge and practice, this paper concentrates on modelling Building Emission Rate (BER), which is used as the primary index for reflecting non-domestic buildings energy efficiency in the UK.

The outcome of the study provides a robust and accurate BER estimation tool to be used in energy efficiency optimisation of complex and heterogeneous buildings. Hence, the model uses a broad dataset of existing buildings rather than notional ones with varying characteristics. Furthermore, the model, coupled with sensitivity analysis allows for identification of the contribution of each input parameter to the overall building performance.The procedure considered available retrofit technologies on the market to cover all alterations in energy performance estimation caused by the application of them.

Therefore, it will also facilitate the development and implementation of policies and practices regarding buildings energy efficiency.

The former entails designing a system with neglect to the information of sub-systems and calculates the incorporated energy rates considering different general building materials. The bottom-up technique involves an accumulation of building system-level details and comparison to actual building efficiency to create a more accurate summary [23].Wang et al.

        <p>[24] addressed a model-based and empirical benchmarking and classified it into three main categories: engineering calculation, simulation model-based benchmarking and statistical modelling. The engineering methodologies employ physical laws for the derivation of building energy consumption in whole or sub-system levels. Building energy efficiency simulation includes software and computer models for simulation of performance with predefined status [25]. The statistical methods use building historical data and frequently apply regression to model the energy consumption/performance of buildings. These models are also called data-driven surrogate models as they take advantage of existing data instead of relying upon intricate system detail [26].[24] addressed a model-based and empirical benchmarking and classified it into three main categories: engineering calculation, simulation model-based benchmarking and statistical modelling.

        <p>Statistical models are utilised in benchmarking by introducing an anticipated value of energy usage for each building. This method uses different building characteristics as input variables and energy indicator as target values for developing a linear or non-linear model to assess other buildings [26]. The traditional statistical method that has been used widely in the building sector is simple and multivariate regression models [27]. Another popular method is change point regression model, which imitates the non-linear behaviour of input features [28]. Stochastic frontier analysis which is a developed ordinary least squares regression introduces a method for inefficiency calculation rather than only a simple error measurement [29]. Data envelopment analysis [30] which is a non-parametric method, in contrast with linear regression does not provide any information on the relation of building physical characteristics [31]. By increasing the vast amount of valid and attainable datasets of buildings, there is a great interest in the utilisation of Artificial Intelligent (AI) methods such as ML in the construction sector [26].Statistical models are utilised in benchmarking by introducing an anticipated value of energy usage for each building.

        <p>ML is generally used to describe computer algorithms that learn from existing data. These algorithms normally use a large amount of data and a relatively small number of input features for learning processes [32]. ML models operate as a black box and find the relation between the selected input building features and the given energy index, so further information about the building is not required. These features are not necessarily raw building characteristics or weather data; instead, they could be complex variables calculated from basic ones, e.g. wall to floor ratio and mean daily global radiation [33]. The most applied ML techniques in building energy performance assessment are Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble models [26].ML is generally used to describe computer algorithms that learn from existing data.

        <p>Yalcintas [34,35] used ANN for energy benchmarking in tropical climate contemplate weather and chiller data. The selected building includes office, classroom, laboratory-type buildings, or mixed-use buildings. The accuracy of energy use intensity prediction is compared with multiple linear regression method showing a remarkable advantage over it. Wong et al. [36] used ANN for assessing the dynamic energy performance of a commercial building with day-lighting in Hong Kong. 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs> software along with algorithms for calculation of interior reflection, was applied to generate the building daily energy usage. ANN can be used for the determination of parameters for energy performance assessment of buildings. Lundin et al. [37] proposed a method for prediction of total heat loss coefficient, the total heat capacity and the gain factor that are key elements in the estimation of energy efficiency [32]. Buratti et al. [38] employed ANN for evaluation of building energy certificates accuracy using 6500 energy labels in Italy. The study investigated a different combination of input variables to minimise the number of training features. Hong et al. [21] applied ANN for benchmarking of school buildings in the UK and investigated the limitations of the assessment. An extensive database, including 120000 records was used for training and testing the model [39]. Khayatian et al. [40] predicted energy performance certificates for residential building using an ANN model and Italian CENED database as training records. A combination set of direct and calculated features was used as inputs to predict heat demand indicators. Ascione et al. [41] proposed an ANN for evaluation of energy consumption and inhabitants' thermal comfort to predict the energy performance of new and retrofitted buildings separately. At the same time, Beccali et al. [42] proposed the use of ANN fast forecasting as a decision support tool for optimising the refurbishment actions of buildings located in Italy.

        <p>In 2010, Li et al. [43] used SVM for long-term prediction (yearly) of electricity consumption of domestic buildings. They considered fifteen building envelope parameters collected from 59 different cases along with the annual electricity consumption, which is normalised by unit area. Besides, they compared the accuracy of the SVM model with three types of ANNs, including propagation, RFB and general regression. Testing the trained model over 20% of study cases provided results that showed SVM outperforms ANNs for all samples. Solomon et al. [44] predicted weekly electricity consumption of a massive commercial building considering previous electricity usage, temperature data and wind velocity.In 2010, Li et al.

        <p>The use of ensemble ML models (e.g. RF) in the building energy domain is restricted to only recent years [45,46,47,48,49], despite a very established track-record of utilisation in other disciplines. Papadopoulos et al. [50] also compared different ensemble models in estimation of the energy performance of residential buildings (including 768 variations of a model building) evaluated using 
            <rs type="software">Ecotect</rs> software. In a recent study [49] which tuned and compared the most commonly used models revealed ensemble models outperforms the alternatives. It was ascertained that the standard and advanced Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRTs) produce the most accurate predictions.

        <p>The aim of building energy performance benchmarking has been to inspire the owners to consume more efficiently [51]. Hence, there has been a necessity for a legal framework to exert the potential of the benchmarking in reducing energy consumption and consequently, carbon emissions. The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) and Display Energy Certificate (DEC) programs were adopted in the UK to satisfy EU Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD) requirements [52]. The EPC scheme is developed to express the energy-efficiency of buildings regarding their asset ratings which are calculated using simulations. These ratings indicate the carbon emissions of a building as built or as designed. Therefore, EPCs aim at the performance assessment of buildings concerning their fabric and services [53]. In contrast, DECs are certificates which denote the efficiency of the operational energy consumption. The principal distinction from the EPC and DEC is whether performance is estimated from simulation or operation. The certificate also includes the inefficient uses of the energy [53]. Hence DECs encourage the occupants to behave in a more energy-efficient manner.The aim of building energy performance benchmarking has been to inspire the owners to consume more efficiently [51].

        <p>Operational ratings are calculated by comparing the carbon emissions of the building with a representative building. The benchmark indicates the typical performance of similar buildings and can be notional or actual [54]. The SBEM tool calculates the energy requirements for the expected levels of heating, hot water, cooling, fans and pumps and fixed internal lighting. These levels are based on the geometry, construction types and assigned activities, along with the services system types, efficiencies and control corrections. Upon calculation of the aggregate energy demand, SBEM transforms the energy into CO 2 emission (i.e. BER).Operational ratings are calculated by comparing the carbon emissions of the building with a representative building.

        <p>The Standard Emission Rate (SER) is determined by applying a fixed improvement factor to the emissions from a reference building. EPCs are intended to send market signals about the relative performance of comparable buildings, and so it is necessary that the reference building should be the same for all buildings of a given type. The reference building specifications introduced in 2015 are assigned based upon the servicing strategy identified for each zone within the proposed building. There are therefore two notional building specifications for a) Heated and naturally ventilated zones, and b) Heated and mechanically ventilated or heated and cooled zones [55].The Standard Emission Rate (SER) is determined by applying a fixed improvement factor to the emissions from a reference building.

        <p>The 'reference building', is a version of the actual building modified in accordance with rules relating to glazing area, insulation and system efficiency. Each space must contain the same activity as proposed for the equivalent space in the actual building. The reference building is generated by

            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs>. The specification for both developed by the Building Research Establishment (BRE). Both actual and reference buildings have monthly heat balances performed for standard weather data appropriate to the building location. Results are automatically fed into the Building Regulations UK, Part L [19] compliance calculator provided by BRE. The energy performance standards f the reference building is based on a concurrent specification that delivers a 43% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to the 2010 energy performance standards based on an assumed build mix. This means that the emissions target for some buildings will improve by more than this percentage, others by less [55]. The operational energy performance and asset ratings are displayed in terms of seven-letter ranks, from 'A' to 'G', where a lower EPC index indicate better performance. It can be seen in equation (2) that a building with an energy consumption similar to the typical performance of buildings in that class will get an operational rating of 50, i.e. between the grades 'C' and 'E.'

        <p>This paper concentrates on modelling BER which is used as the main index for reflecting non-domestic buildings energy efficiency in the UK. The reasons for this are that the SER is static and depending on whether the SER is greater than or less than 50 affects the BER/EPC-Index ratio. The outcome of this study is a robust and accurate BER estimation tool to be used in energy efficiency optimisation of complex and heterogeneous buildings. Hence, the model uses a broad dataset of existing buildings rather than representative reference or notional models.This paper concentrates on modelling BER which is used as the main index for reflecting non-domestic buildings energy efficiency in the UK.

        <p>Building energy efficiency enhancement consists of an optimisation method of determining a selection of technically advantageous and cost-effective measures. The traditional procedure of evaluating a broad variety of retrofit technologies is to investigate several potential solutions based on practician experience. The primary restriction of this strategy is that only limited number of scenarios can be evaluated and the probability of obtaining an optimal solution is quite low. It has been indicated that by implementing non-optimised solutions, it is possible to alter the building at a subsequent attempt imposing much higher cost [56]. This issue causes investors to be unwilling to invest in their building energy efficiency improvement.Building energy efficiency enhancement consists of an optimisation method of determining a selection of technically advantageous and cost-effective measures.

        <p>MCA still relies on users' experience by defining a set of alternative options and pre-evaluation of the solutions. As such achieving the most optimal retrofit packages is not guaranteed [58]. IN MCA,each criterion is weighted, and then total weights create a unique criterion. Gero et al. [59] were among the first to suggest an MCA method for designing energy efficient building. This model examined the trade-off between the thermal efficiency and other factors which are not energy-related (e.g. building cost and available area). This approach was then followed by several researchers by applying in related problems [60,61,62,63]. Jaggs et al. [64] and Flourentzou et al. [65] suggested strategies for the assessment of retrofitting situations. Kaklauskas et al. [66] proposed a multivariate design and MCA approach for deep energy retrofit, defining the importance and advantages of building retrofit options and choosing the topmost preferred alternative. Another drawback MCA based methods is that the information about the sensitivity of each criterion to alteration of others is not provided [67]. Multi-criteria optimisation of CO 2 emission and retrofit cost by considering a few variables including insulation values, air tightness, lighting controls, system efficiencies and PV provision has been reported [13]. It has been pointed out that at least 9,000 simulations are required to obtain optimal solutions. By taking a large number of variables and their options, the number of obligatory simulations will be tremendously increased.MCA still relies on users' experience by defining a set of alternative options and pre-evaluation of the solutions.

        <p>The other method, which is based on MOO, allows considering a broad retrofit technology options limiting the search space and perceive the tradeoffs among the objective functions assisting in attaining an optimal solution. Still, comparatively limited consideration has been given to tackling building retrofit DM support with MOO [68]. This is due to the fact that a large number of simulations are required to obtain a solution. These calculations are time-consuming and demand for heavy processing in case of using energy simulation tools. Diakaki et al. [69] studied the usefulness of applying MOO methods for enhancing building energy efficiency, by use of a simplified model for thermal simulation. Asadi et al. [68] developed a MOO model to support the definition of retrofit scenarios intended to cost-effectively optimise energy consumption. Further to that, a MOO model coupled with TRNSYS was developed to optimise retrofit cost, energy savings, and thermal comfort in a residential building [70].The other method, which is based on MOO, allows considering a broad retrofit technology options limiting the search space and perceive the tradeoffs among the objective functions assisting in attaining an optimal solution. Still, comparatively limited consideration has been given to tackling building retrofit DM support with MOO [68]. This is due to the fact that a large number of simulations are required to obtain a solution. These calculations are time-consuming and demand for heavy processing in case of using energy simulation tools. Diakaki et al. [69] studied the usefulness of applying MOO methods for enhancing building energy efficiency, by use of a simplified model for thermal simulation. Asadi et al. [68] developed a MOO model to support the definition of retrofit scenarios intended to cost-effectively optimise energy consumption. Further to that, a MOO model coupled with TRNSYS was developed to optimise retrofit cost, energy savings, and thermal comfort in a residential building [70].</p>
        <p>Ascione et al. [17] proposed a framework for the MOO to optimise building energy design considering the most extensive selection of objective functions and design variables. Genetic Algorithm (GA), combined with 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs>, was used to generate the retrofit solution space for an office building. The same group previously was focused on the use of MOO for optimising residential buildings retrofit planning [71]. Gou et al. [72] used the MOO approach by coupling ANN and GA to optimise residential building comfort indoor and energy usage. Ferrara et al. [18] also focused on a residential building and used 
            <rs type="software">TRNSYS</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">GenOpt</rs> optimisation software to minimise energy demand and global cost. Bre and Fachinotti [73] focused on minimising energy consumptions for heating and cooling and maximising thermal comfort for occupants by coupling EnergyPlus and GA. Jafari and Valentin [74] also employed GA and 
            <rs type="software">eQuest</rs> and aimed at optimisation of life cycle cost of the retrofit strategies for a residential building. Carlucci et al. [75] used GA and 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs> to optimise thermal, visual comfort and indoor air quality in the design stage [76]. With similar configuration and adding ANN, Yu et al. [16] aimed at evaluating energy usage and thermal comfort for the design of the Chinese buildings. Pilechiha et al. [9] aimed at optimisation of window design in an office room considering the trade-offs among the quality of views, daylight and building energy loads and employing various tools including 
            <rs type="software">EnergyPlus</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">Grasshopper</rs> and hypervolume-based evolutionary optimisation algorithm. Another research proposing an EnergyPlus-based optimisation for retrofitting office buildings has reported weeks of simulation for a single case [14] Before applying a ML, it is necessary to transform the raw building data into a form which is amenable to learning. This procedure includes extracting meaningful input variables (features) from the available data. Each application requires specific considerations when applying this transformation. As the aim of this study was to provide a fast energy efficiency estimation tool for retrofit planning applications, it was essential to take all the available retrofit technologies into account. Hence, the model should produce accurate energy performance predictions, as well as the effect of any alteration due to a building upgrade. The features could be numeric or categorical. However, categorical variables are not preferable as they are converted to binary variables representing each possible value which increases the feature space and consequently the time complexity.

        <p>When the features are selected all data is transferred to the ML space. At this step, training ML models is essential to evaluate the accuracy of predictions using the chosen set of variables. ML requires a reasonable amount of data, and the more precise data leads in a more accurate model.When the features are selected all data is transferred to the ML space.

        <p>A critical task in employing ML techniques is the optimisation of model parameters [49]. This procedure is known as tuning, which plays an essential role in the accuracy of ML model predictions. Tuning becomes a more critical task when using complex models such as ANN and GBRT. Picking unsuitable hyperparameters will lead to inaccuracy, which may incorrectly be interpreted as the model failure. Tuning a model is as important as selecting the appropriate input variables for creating and effective ML model. Every ML model has various hyperparameters or meta-parameters which control the learning and prediction processes. A fundamental point in tuning hyperparameters is the generalisation. It means that how well the learning model predicts the specific examples not seen by the model when it was training. Hence, in the procedure of model optimisation, there should be a proper mechanism such as cross-validation to avoid this issue, which is called over-fitting (i.e. representing the training data well but not well suited to unseen data).A critical task in employing ML techniques is the optimisation of model parameters [49].

        <p>GBRT is an ensemble of decision trees (DT) which is a non-parametric model, creates tree-like structures [77]. This ML model continuously splits the data into smaller and smaller subsets and stops when only one record remains in every subgroup. These inner groups and the solitary sets are called nodes and leaves, respectively. However, the accuracy of DT is extensively dependent on the distribution of samples in the training set. Hence, they are not stable models as small changes in the observations will affect the entire structure. One promising solution for that issue has been the utilising a series of DTs and calculating the mean predicted values of all independent trees. The first variation of DT is known as random forest which employs bagging to connect separate models but containing similar information and creates a linear combination from several independent trees. The significant distinction separating GBRT and RF is that the latter one generates fully exploited DTs, which are all independent of each. Whilst GBRT applies small trees (weak learners) with high bias and low variance [78].GBRT is an ensemble of decision trees (DT) which is a non-parametric model, creates tree-like structures [77].

        <p>Indeed, these trees are not independent of each other; alternately, every branch is built on the basis of the former simplistic models using a weighting method. This procedure is boosting algorithm in which every inner node splits the given sample set to two branches. Assuming a three nodes GBRT, then there will be one division node in which the best partition of the data is determined, and the deviation of the obtained values are estimated. By training over those residuals, the succeeding DT will explore for a new segment of data to decrease the error variance.Indeed, these trees are not independent of each other; alternately, every branch is built on the basis of the former simplistic models using a weighting method.

        <p>Validation is the essential method used for the assessment of the ML model stability and the demonstration of model generalisation. It represents how well the model performs in predicting unseen data (the dataset which is not used to train the model). In this study, cross-validation, a standard statistical re-sampling method, was employed. In this method, each dataset is randomly divided into k folds, including a training subset, which is used for training the ML model, and a testing subset. These are used to evaluate the model's generalisation efficiency. Then, the average of all k folds accuracies (e.g. RMSE) is calculated and regarded as the final performance. This technique assists the model development procedure in avoiding over-fitting and under-fitting. The former refers to capturing noise and relations which do not generalise accurately to new data. In this case, the trained model runs exceptionally well on the training set, yet poorly at the test set. The latter refers to not capturing relations adequately in the data. In these cases, model accuracy would be poor for both the training and the test sets.Validation is the essential method used for the assessment of the ML model stability and the demonstration of model generalisation.

        <p>Feature engineering, as a fundamental element of the application of machine learning, is defined as "using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work " [82]. For high-performance prediction by ML, the most explicit and profound relationship of data should be exposed in the form of features. Building energy performance modelling requires strong expertise in building physics and retrofit technologies as well as creative feature extraction methods to interpret this knowledge into useful features. Feature engineering is not a one-step procedure, but several processes are iteratively applied until a satisfactory result is achieved. Figure 3 demonstrates the life cycle of feature engineering which is adopted in this study. Firstly, the raw data, including several thousands of non-domestic records, are collected. Potential features related to building characteristics are then selected. This also includes combining datasets from different building energy data to generate unique and independent features. Statistical analysis is then performed to evaluate the impact of derived features. This step involves an investigation of data to identify potential outliers and correlation analysis. The subsequent stage, which is crucial to achieving the main objective of this study, is engineering new features. In this step, it is essential to consider retrofit technologies to be covered by the variables, as the aim of this study was not only to predict energy performance accurately but also to effectively support retrofit decision-making. This process is therefore for creating new features from existing variables based on knowledge on retrofit planning and energy performance calculation (SBEM). It also includes translating categorical variables to the ML model usable form. When the final feature set is decided, a model is trained using the set and then scored using the evaluation method described earlier in this section.

High inter-correlations of features result in bias within tree-building for predictions where decision tree models are sensitive to the inter-correlation among the input variables, and forecast would be problematic based on highly correlated inputs [86]. It is not also possible to identify which variable can be removed without affecting the model precision.As seen in Figure 5, there are no direct correlations between selected variables and BER.

        <p>An ML model was optimised using the generated as well as actual data. The GBRT model was tuned using SMAC algorithm and 5,000 randomly selected record. This research used a five-fold-cross validation for evaluating the performance of each model configuration. The tuning algorithm output after 1,000 iterations was the hyper-parameter set with which the model reached the RMSE accuracy of 7.01 kgCO 2 /m 2 × year (mean RMSE of all folds). Next, the same configuration was used for modelling variant number of records up to 80,000. Each model was tested using ten-fold cross-validation, and the results recorded as the worst, average and best RMSE of all folds, as demonstrated in Figure 6.An ML model was optimised using the generated as well as actual data.

        <p>As shown in Figure 6, 30,000 samples of building assessment records are adequate to build a reliable model, as at this point, the prediction interval of [1.57, 2.55] with an average RMSE of 1.92 kgCO 2 /m 2 × year is achieved. Considering the average actual BER of 94.04 kgCO 2 /m 2 × year for all building records, the attained error, which is only 2% of the target mean value is a promising achievement. Using the full dataset, the average RMSE of 1.25 kgCO 2 /m 2 × year equal to 1.3% of the target mean value could be achieved with the acceptable cost of sacrificing time. The average spent time for fitting models with 30,000 and 80,000 samples was recorded as 7.12 and 31.22 seconds.As shown in Figure 6, 30,000 samples of building assessment records are adequate to build a reliable model, as at this point, the prediction interval of [1.57, 2.55] with an average RMSE of 1.92 kgCO 2 /m 2 × year is achieved.

        <p>While this research is effectively the creation of an energy performance emulator for existing non-domestic buildings, this study is focused on retrofit decision-making. Therefore feature engineering targeted not only an accurate prediction of building energy performance, but also the ability of the model to predict post-retrofit performance. As such, it is beneficial to investigate the impact of each selected variable on estimating buildings energy performance. To this end, the GBRT model was trained 30 times each using randomly selected records (30,000) and different random states. The results illustrated in Figure 7 plot the relative importance of features as a box and whiskers plot.While this research is effectively the creation of an energy performance emulator for existing non-domestic buildings, this study is focused on retrofit decision-making.

        <p>The result of permutation importance analysis considering a model trained over 80% of full data and the rest for testing is presented in Figure 8. It can be seen that very similar results to those presented in Figure 7 were achieved. This shows that the GBRT model has not been biased in the training procedure and inflating the feature importances. Consequently, the most significant features are related to domestic hot water, internal heat gain and lighting. These parameters cover the improvement of the hot water system, replacing the lamps and heating systems. SER which is indirectly calculated from the building energy assessment procedure, along with the wall to floor and window to wall ratios are not mutable. That is to say, in energy retrofitting the structure of the building is not altered. However, they play an influential role in predicting energy performance. Other immutable features with high impact having almost the same relative importance, are space ratios, followed by air infiltration rate, terminal unit energy demand and cooling system efficiency. As it could be anticipated, the roof to wall ratio, solar radiation on the roof and generally solar radiation have medium to low impact, due to the UK climate. Although the importance of some features of a building is obvious in the field study, the sensitivity analysis here further cross-checks the results of the developed ML model with field results. Conforming this in the model acts as an indicator of external validity of it, and as a means for triangulation.The result of permutation importance analysis considering a model trained over 80% of full data and the rest for testing is presented in Figure 8.

        <p>To evaluate the efficiency of the developed model on the prediction of variations of a building, a single floor from a non-domestic building located in Glasgow city was selected. The details and data for the eighth floor of Graham Hills building were obtained from the Estates department of the University of Strathclyde. The building energy model was translated from IES Workstation to DesignBuilder before being extended to introduce the zoning shown in Figure 10. All zones are naturally ventilated except toilets which have local extract fans. Although the eighth floor exclusively uses low-temperature hot water boilers with wet radiators, other levels share several different systems, some of which including cooling and mechanical ventilation. The DHW system does not share heat generation with the wet radiator systems.To evaluate the efficiency of the developed model on the prediction of variations of a building, a single floor from a non-domestic building located in Glasgow city was selected.

        <p>Considering the recommendations introduced in Table 1 and employing the GA, the studied building was mutated into 3,000 distinct retrofitted versions. All generated building models were assessed by the software and received the emission ratings, which vary from 51 to 80 kgCO 2 /(m 2 × year). The process of evaluating all generated data using the SBEM tool took almost three days. In order to take full advantage of the ML model for this case study, the model was fitted using the whole training set. Then the trained model was used to predict the energy performance of the mutated records. Testing all samples took only 0.22 seconds while having RSME, MAE and R 2 of 1.02, 0.47 and 0.98, respectively.Considering the recommendations introduced in Table 1 and employing the GA, the studied building was mutated into 3,000 distinct retrofitted versions.

        <p>Although the development of data-driven models requires a considerable amount of historical data and precise optimisation to achieve high accuracy in prediction of building energy performance, the speed of calculations is not comparable with energy simulation software. The most time-consuming procedure in ML model development is feature engineering which can be considered as software development stage for energy simulation. Once the model is trained, it can assess millions of building records in a second. As the results indicated three thousands variations of a case study building which SBEM simulation took three days to calculate their emission rates, were assessed by the ML model in less than 0.22 seconds while providing a high accuracy as 1.7% of the average BER value. Meanwhile, the model can be updated with new data very fast to improve accuracy further. It should be noted again that the ML model is not proposed to ultimately replace the engineering methods, but to promote the decision-making process where massive calculations are required. In practice, when a retrofit configuration or building design is selected with the support of a data-driven model, it should be evaluated by the base engineering method for the detail energy simulation (e.g. SBEM in this study).Although the development of data-driven models requires a considerable amount of historical data and precise optimisation to achieve high accuracy in prediction of building energy performance, the speed of calculations is not comparable with energy simulation software.

        <p>The proposed model solves two significant problems with the existing tools which leverage SBEM, static retrofit package definitions and blindness to indirect service dependence. The former is a limitation on the size of the solution space that can be exhaustively explored. The latter are scenarios where retrofitting one building service increases demand on another to the extent that the energy savings for the isolated service demand are negated by the increased demand on the dependent service. The typical example of SBEM is the relationship between Tungsten or Halogen lighting and direct or storage electric heating where heating is the dependent service. As far as SBEM is concerned, lighting fixtures both contribute significantly to space heating and their contributions when considered with also meeting the lighting demand, are more efficient than the electric heating system in tempering the space. The existing model, which works based on an exhaustive search of the solution space using linear estimation, treats the retrofit an antagonistic matter. As such, it will not serve as a component of a candidate retrofit strategy. The proposed model solves and can leverage the underpinning diminishment of energy savings. It solves the problem by producing an estimate that is sufficiently accurate to be considered as a proxy for a nonlinear estimation of each retrofit scenario meaning a retrofit which might be antagonistic in isolation is considered in compound scenarios. The model, being many orders of magnitude faster than existing models, enables variable calibration of individual and grouped retrofit technologies. This can be leveraged during MOO with the nonlinear relationship between multiple objectives to find the Pareto fronts that approach losses to meet another objective.The proposed model solves two significant problems with the existing tools which leverage SBEM, static retrofit package definitions and blindness to indirect service dependence.

        <p>This research highlights the significance of feature extraction and engineering in the estimation of energy indices applying the built-in mechanisms of gradient boosted regression trees. There have been several assumptions and limitations in creating building models and simulations that affect energy predictions. Accordingly, this study demonstrated that in the development of energy modelling for retrofit decision-making or other applications, such as building management, achieving a high accuracy is not the only concern. It is crucial to consider all the variations and reflects the corresponding impacts in the model behaviour. For example, a proper energy model for supporting building energy management system should consider occupant behaviour, as it can vary by different situations and cause model failure. Whilst the model can accurately perform in the normal condition due to insufficient data collection. The presented results also revealed the potential of machine learning-based modelling for removing irrelevant variables without influencing accuracy.This research highlights the significance of feature extraction and engineering in the estimation of energy indices applying the built-in mechanisms of gradient boosted regression trees.

        <p>As policy tightens on inefficient energy consumption and the understanding of the limitations of building energy management led retrofit decision-making, the necessity for more efficient and flexible models increases. Research over the last few years has been giving greater credence to designing buildings with consideration for medium-term climate change and any number of occupant presence or behaviour uncertainties. Every extension to the potential configurations exponentially inflates the problem space while likely reducing the conventional options solution space. Furthermore, these climate and utilisation properties are internal to building energy management. However, design and retrofit analysis is increasingly considering external and more challenging to integrate properties. The procedure introduced in this study demonstrated that algorithmic decision-making capabilities were not nearing their limit and laid a foundation for more complex machine learning frameworks.
