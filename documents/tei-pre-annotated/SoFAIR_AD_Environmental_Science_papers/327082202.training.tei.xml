        <p>Water clarity is a well-established first-order indicator of water quality and has been used globally by water regulators in their monitoring and management programs. Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (Z SD ) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle α, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS Z SD model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical Z SD models, our FUI and α-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer Z SD of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the Z SD of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of "high west and low east" over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China's population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the Z SD of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their Z SD value during the past 18 years while only 8.5% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake Z SD were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake Z SD was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term.Water clarity is a well-established first-order indicator of water quality and has been used globally by water regulators in their monitoring and management programs.

        <p>Lakes and reservoirs are critical for our wellbeing since they are core to water supply, food production, recreation activities, commerce, and human health (Dörnhöfer and Oppelt, 2016;Williamson et al., 2009;Tyler et al., 2016). However, these inland water bodies are faced with multiple and compounding pressures from a number of users and uses, as well as climate change (Adrian et al., 2009;de Eyto et al., 2016;O'Reilly et al., 2003). Water clarity provides important and synthetic information on water quality and lake's ecosystem status (Kirk, 1994;McCullough et al., 2012;Pirhalla et al., 2017). It varies with the three major optically active components (OAC) of water, i.e., suspended particulate matter (SPM), phytoplankton (usually represented by chlorophyll-a concentration, Chl-a), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Water clarity has a direct link to the underwater light field and therefore to lake photosynthetic production (Biber et al., 2005;McPherson et al., 2011). Water clarity monitoring is essential to understand long-term changes in lake ecosystems, as well as to support environmental protection strategies (Olmanson et al., 2008;Suominen and Tolvanen, 2016).Lakes and reservoirs are critical for our wellbeing since they are core to water supply, food production, recreation activities, commerce, and human health (Dörnhöfer and Oppelt, 2016;Williamson et al., 2009;Tyler et al., 2016).

        <p>Water clarity has been historically measured in water bodies as the Secchi disk depth (Z SD , m), which is determined by the depth at which a white or black and white disk disappears from the observer's sight (Lee et al., 2018a(Lee et al., , 2018b;;Wernand, 2010). Compared with other measures of water clarity, e.g., the turbidity or downwelling irradiance diffuse attenuation coefficient (K d ), the collection of Secchi disk depth is much easier and more cost-effective. Therefore, the Z SD measurement has been performed extensively with a tradition still ongoing and expanding by numerous citizen science projects, such as the Secchi Disk and Eye on Water (http://www.secchidisk.org/;https://www. eyeonwater.org/).Water clarity has been historically measured in water bodies as the Secchi disk depth (Z SD , m), which is determined by the depth at which a white or black and white disk disappears from the observer's sight (Lee et al., 2018a(Lee et al., , 2018b;;Wernand, 2010).

        <p>Although the Z SD is one of the simplest measures of water properties, information on water clarity is still limited in terms of spatial coverage, temporal frequency, and representativeness. Given the revisit capacities and wide-swath observation (Doron et al., 2011;Mouw et al., 2015) of sensors onboard satellite platforms, Earth observation (EO) data can provide a feasible source to monitor long-term changes in water clarity over large regions. Numerous empirical models have been developed to estimate water clarity, including single-band and bandratio algorithms. For example, Olmanson et al. (2008) developed and evaluated an empirical Z SD model using Landsat TM1 and TM3 bands to monitor 20-year changes of Z SD over 10,500 lakes in the state of Minnesota. They demonstrated that satellite imagery can provide an accurate method to obtain comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of water clarity. In another study, Binding et al. (2007Binding et al. ( , 2015) ) produced monthly binned images of remote sensing radiance over the Great Lakes by merging data from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), the Seaviewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). They used the remote sensing radiance at 555 nm to interpret changes in the Z SD across the Great Lakes. Duan et al. (2009) evaluated the Z SD of three lakes in northeast China from Landsat TM imagery based on four regression equations, which indicated strong geographic patterns in lake water clarity over this region.Although the Z SD is one of the simplest measures of water properties, information on water clarity is still limited in terms of spatial coverage, temporal frequency, and representativeness.

        <p>The theoretical interpretation of Z SD has been recently revised by considering a Secchi disk not a point source to human eyes (Lee et al., 2015;Lee et al., 2018aLee et al., , 2018b)), which led to an innovative semi-analytical model for estimating Z SD from satellite imagery via deriving water's inherent optical properties (IOPs) (Lee et al., 2016). Rodrigues et al. (2017) evaluated this new model in a reservoir in Brazil with Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data, and suggested that the derivation of IOPs was the limiting factor in retrieving accurate Z SD by this model. Feng et al. (2019a) tested and applied this new model to explore changes in lake clarity in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River basin in China, and analyzed the environmental factors affecting the change trends. Nevertheless, the complexity and dynamic variability of optical properties found in inland waters (Spyrakos et al., 2018) remain as obstacles for the systematic application of these empirical and analytical models over a wider range of optical water types (Ren et al., 2018). Moreover, challenges associated with atmospheric correction, adjacency effects, low signal-to-noise and limited resolutions of existing sensors over lakes can exacerbate these difficulties (Li et al., 2017;Mouw et al., 2015;Palmer et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2011).The theoretical interpretation of Z SD has been recently revised by considering a Secchi disk not a point source to human eyes (Lee et al., 2015;Lee et al., 2018aLee et al., , 2018b)), which led to an innovative semi-analytical model for estimating Z SD from satellite imagery via deriving water's inherent optical properties (IOPs) (Lee et al., 2016).

        <p>There are thousands of lakes and reservoirs (hereafter termed as "lakes" for brevity) located broadly in China characterized by a variety of diverse types and regional characteristics (Ma et al., 2011;Wang and Dou, 1998). Based on the geological origin, topography, water resource characteristics, and lake hydrological characteristics, Chinese lakes can be divided into five distinct regions, i.e., the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Region (QTR), Mengxin Plateau Region (MXR), Yungui Plateau Region (YGR), Northeast Mount-Plain Region (NER), and East Plain Region (EPR) (Wang and Dou, 1998). In the recent half-century, China has experienced rapid economic development and population expansion, as well as the effects of climate change, which collectively has placed pressure on lake ecosystems (Ma et al., 2010;Yang et al., 2010aYang et al., , 2010b;;Zhang et al., 2019). Effective monitoring of lake clarity across large areas and long-time spans is an important task for government management agencies. Given the difficulties in Z SD estimation over various types of optically complex inland waters, a comprehensive and systematic assessment of water clarity in lakes across China has not yet been completed.There are thousands of lakes and reservoirs (hereafter termed as "lakes" for brevity) located broadly in China characterized by a variety of diverse types and regional characteristics (Ma et al., 2011;Wang and Dou, 1998).

        <p>In recent years, the FUI (Forel-Ule Index) and hue angle (α) have been shown to be useful water color parameters in indicating the bulk changes of water quality, and can be derived from multispectral satellite data with high accuracies (Van der Woerd and Wernand, 2018;Wang et al., 2015). Recent studies have found that there are strong correlations between Z SD and FUI for both oceanic and inland waters (Garaba et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016;Pitarch et al., 2019;Wernand et al., 2013). In this study, we developed an empirical Z SD model based on FUI and α and evaluated it using a comprehensive match-up dataset collected from geographically widespread lakes distributed across China. Further, for the first time, maps of Z SD for nationwide large lakes in China were generated based on MODIS observations and used to reveal the long-term temporal and spatial trends in water clarity across China from 2000 to 2017. Moreover, the relationship between the lake clarity and economic developments and climate change over different regions were explored and discussed.In recent years, the FUI (Forel-Ule Index) and hue angle (α) have been shown to be useful water color parameters in indicating the bulk changes of water quality, and can be derived from multispectral satellite data with high accuracies (Van der Woerd and Wernand, 2018;Wang et al., 2015).

        <p>MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09) provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for Bands 1-7 (i.e., 645, 859, 469, 555, 1240, 1640, and 2130 nm) at a spatial resolution of 500 m (Vermote, 2015). As global products started from 2000, MOD09 products are considered an important data source for long-term and large scale environmental monitoring (Feng et al., 2018a;Hou et al., 2017). MOD09A1 is the 8-day composite surface reflectance data, which selects one best reflectance observation during the 8-day period at the pixel level with the criteria including cloud free and optimal solar zenith (Vermote and Kotchenova, 2008). Hence, this MOD09A1 data were used to estimate the long-term Z SD changes in large lakes across China in this study. In order to narrow the match-up time window, the daily MOD09 data (MOD09GA) were used to match the in-situ data and develop the model after removing the pixels containing clouds and other obvious noises. The daily MOD09GA data were not used in the long-term monitoring in this study because it may contain large errors and even negative reflectance over lakes that are probably caused by bad observational conditions and non-optimal atmospheric corrections, while the 8-day composite MOD09A1 data can avoid these uncertainties in a certain degree by selecting the best observation for each pixel. The image archive between 2000 and 2017 was downloaded from the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09) provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance for Bands 1-7 (i.e., 645, 859, 469, 555, 1240, 1640, and 2130 nm) at a spatial resolution of 500 m (Vermote, 2015).

        <p>A large dataset of in-situ Z SD including 478 samplings was collected from 27 lakes across China during 38 campaigns from 2006 to 2019 and compiled to develop and test the Z SD estimation model in this study (see Fig. 1). The Z SD values in our dataset ranged between 0.1 and 13.1 m. A variety of conditions and characteristics were found in the dataset ranging from the clear and oligotrophic lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in west China, such as Qinghai Lake and Namco Lake, to the turbid and eutrophic lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in east China, such as Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake, and to eutrophic lake in southwest China, i.e., Dianchi Lake. Due to the remoteness, altitude, and harsh conditions that characterize the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, fewer data were collected from lakes in this area where Z SD values are typically higher. We note a majority of the in-situ data in the QTR were acquired from Liu et al. (2017). For these measurements, a typical black and white Secchi disk was used in the field campaigns to determine Z SD . The disk was lowered into the water and the Z SD was determined as the depth where the disk was no longer visible by an observer from the water surface. To avoid the effects of land-adjacency and low solar altitude, in situ samples were collected at least 500 m away from the shoreline and around solar noon time.A large dataset of in-situ Z SD including 478 samplings was collected from 27 lakes across China during 38 campaigns from 2006 to 2019 and compiled to develop and test the Z SD estimation model in this study (see Fig. 1).

        <p>The in-situ measured Z SD data were matched up with daily MOD09GA data with the purpose of developing an empirical model to estimate Z SD using the MOD09 images. The nearest pixel to the in-situ sampling sites was obtained under the condition that the pixel was not detected as clouds, ice, snow, and other potential noises. The spatial variability of the match-up pixel was also checked at 555 nm with the criteria that the coefficient of variation (CV) is less than 0.2 within a 3 * 3 pixel-box centered at the match-up pixel (Zibordi et al., 2009). In total, there were 288 match-up pairs between Z SD and MOD09GA data compiled from the totally 476 samplings in the 27 lakes (Table 1). With the match-up pairs, 183 data pairs (64% of the total) from 20 campaigns were used to develop the Z SD model, while an independent dataset, including 105 data pairs (36% of the total) from 18 independent campaigns with a wide range of Z SD , was used to test the model (see Table 1). Besides, following the protocol described in Mueller et al. (2003), in-situ measured remote sensing reflectance (R rs , sr -1 ) data were also collected in 246 of the 476 samplings, mainly from Lake Taihu, Lake Chaohu, Lake Poyang, Lake Dianchi and Lake Qinghai.

        <p>In addition to the in-situ dataset, a Hydrolight simulated dataset (IOCCG, 2006), consisting of 500 data points, was employed in the step of Z SD model development. In this simulated dataset, apparent optical properties (AOPs), including the hyperspectral R rs (λ) were generated by the Hydrolight code using the input inherent optical properties (IOPs) in a wide range. More details about this dataset can be found in IOCCG (2006). The FUI in this dataset was calculated from R rs (λ) after conversion to MODIS bands using the MODIS relative spectral response (RSR). The Z SD of each simulation was derived following the method described in Lee et al. (2018aLee et al. ( , 2018b)).

        <p>To better understand the potential environmental factors that may contribute to the spatial and long-term variability of lake clarity in China, three different categories of environmental factors, which have been identified as influencing factors of water quality in previous studies (Feng et al., 2019a;Meng et al., 2015;Srebotnjak et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2012), were considered and preliminarily examined: (1) lake geographic factors (i.e., lake altitude (AL), surface area (SA), average water depth (WD), and local normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), (2) meteorological factors (i.e., near surface air temperature (AT), precipitation (PR), and wind speed (WS)), and (3) human activity factors (i.e., local population (PO) and gross domestic production (GDP)).To better understand the potential environmental factors that may contribute to the spatial and long-term variability of lake clarity in China, three different categories of environmental factors, which have been identified as influencing factors of water quality in previous studies (Feng et al., 2019a;Meng et al., 2015;Srebotnjak et al., 2012;Zhou et al., 2012), were considered and preliminarily examined: (1) lake geographic factors (i.e., lake altitude (AL), surface area (SA), average water depth (WD), and local normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), (2) meteorological factors (i.e., near surface air temperature (AT), precipitation (PR), and wind speed (WS)), and (3) human activity factors (i.e., local population (PO) and gross domestic production (GDP)).</p>

        <p>We note that the AL and WD data for lakes in this study are constant values during the time due to the lack of time-series data, while the other parameters change throughout the time domain. The summer (i.e., from June to September) mean values for the long-term SA, NDVI, AT, PR, and WS data were produced for each year from 2000 to 2017 to be consistent with the periods of derived water clarity data. Annual PO and GDP data by province were used for the time series analysis. Spatially, the local NDVI, AT, PR, and WS data for each lake were computed as the average value of the NDVI, AT, PR, and WS data in the watershed in which the lake is located. The watershed boundaries are specified by China's Third-level Watershed, obtained from the Resource and Environment Data Cloud Platform (http://www.resdc.cn/data. aspx? DATAID = 278). The local GDP and PO data for each lake corresponded to the GDP and PO data for the province in which the lake is located.We note that the AL and WD data for lakes in this study are constant values during the time due to the lack of time-series data, while the other parameters change throughout the time domain.

        <p>For the remote sensing reflectance correction, a pixel-based correction method (Wang et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2018) was used. This method subtracts the minimum value of the near infrared and shortwave infrared bands from reflectance of each band. The pixel-based correction method reduces residual noise in the MOD09A1 data, including the residual aerosol effect, skylight reflection, and sun glint, and converts the MOD09A1 surface reflectance to R rs . It has also been demonstrated that this method works well for the three visible bands over a wide range of inland waters with R rs retrieval uncertainties of approximately 30% (Wang et al., 2016).For the remote sensing reflectance correction, a pixel-based correction method (Wang et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2018) was used.

        <p>Water areas were first automatically segmented from MOD09A1 data using the MODIS 6th band (centered at 1640 nm) following the water extraction scheme proposed in Wang et al., 2018. To avoid the severe land adjacency effect, a 500 m buffer inward of the water boundary was removed for each water body. Optically shallow waters were removed to avoid the effect of the water bottom using the method described in Wang et al., 2018. Image pixels covered by clouds, ice, snow, and other noise were detected using the MOD09A1 QA data and removed from the analysis. At the same time, obvious aquatic vegetation areas were identified and removed. Algae bloom areas, identified using the Floating Algae Index (FAI) method, with a threshold of 0.004 (Duan et al., 2015;Hu, 2009), were removed from the water areas.Water areas were first automatically segmented from MOD09A1 data using the MODIS 6th band (centered at 1640 nm) following the water extraction scheme proposed in Wang et al., 2018.

        <p>Previous studies (Garaba et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016;Pitarch et al., 2019) have shown that bluer and clearer waters are characterized by a lower FUI index. In contrast, more turbid and yellow waters result in a higher FUI index. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between Z SD and FUI based on both the simulated and in-situ measured match-up datasets. We then developed an empirical model for Z SD using the 183 measured match-up pairs. It indicated that Z SD and FUI are characterized by significant negative exponential correlations in both the simulated and the measured match-up datasets (R 2 = 0.95 and 0.93, respectively, in Figs. 3 and4), confirming the strong relationship between Z SD and FUI (Li et al., 2016;Pitarch et al., 2019). We note that the empirical parameters in the Z SD fitting model are different between the simulated and measured datasets (as shown in Figs. 3,4(a), and 4(b)). This is because (1) the simulated dataset covers a larger FUI range from 1 to 21 while the measured data set only includes FUI from 3 to 17 due to the fact that water color in large lakes is normally unable to cover extreme blue or brown colors and (2) the simulated dataset was generated based on bio-optical models mainly for oceanic waters (IOCCG, 2006), which will not represent all the complex situations in inland waters. However, the OACs and underwater light field in inland waters over such a large area can vary in a wide range, such that the relationship between Z SD and FUI is a little loose for the measured dataset. The effect of one specific or more OACs in water on the relationship between Z SD and FUI will be discussed in Section 5.1.Previous studies (Garaba et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016;Pitarch et al., 2019) have shown that bluer and clearer waters are characterized by a lower FUI index.

        <p>However, we found that when the FUI value is low (i.e., FUI &lt; 8), there is a scattering in the relationships for both datasets compared with strong relationships when FUI≥ 8. In other words, one FUI value may correspond to a Z SD range rather than one value for relatively clear waters when FUI &lt; 8. To manage the shortcomings of the dispersive FUI in clear waters, we also analyzed the relationships between α and Z SD . Both Figs. 3 and4 show that the correlations between α and Z SD were better than that between FUI and Z SD when FUI &lt; 8. When FUI ≥ 8, the separating ability between α and Z SD was compressed compared with the separation between FUI and Z SD .

We note that in the measured dataset, the sensitivity of alpha to Z SD is a little bit low when α &lt; 195°(Fig. 4 (c)) because the samplings in clear lakes with α &lt; 195°were limited due to the poor measurement conditions in Tibetian Plateau. And we expect when the Z SD is very large, the uncertainties in the measured Z SD data could be a little higher because the measurement may be impacted by a tilted scale rope or the observer's sight.Here, the empirical parameters in the model for FUI &lt; 8 were generated using measured data with α &lt; 195°(i.e., FUI &lt; 11) to ensure a smooth transition between the two ranges.

It showed that the MODIS model derived Z SD agreed well with the in-situ measured Z SD for the 17 validation lakes with Z SD ranging from 0.2 to 13.1 m (Fig. 5). The MRD value was only 27.4% and the MAD value was 0.37 m, which were generally consistent with the performance when the model was developed. Fig. 6 showed the MRD of the FUI and α-based model with different Z SD ranges based on the validation dataset. There was no significant difference in the MRD of this model for different Z SD ranges, with median values of MRD mainly below 40%. The results indicate that MODIS derived FUI and α can be used with satisfactory performance to retrieve the Z SD for the validation dataset from different types of inland waters, i.e., ranging from clear oligotrophic lakes to extremely turbid and eutrophic waters. Thus, this FUI and α-based model can be used to map the long-term Z SD distribution patterns for inland waters in China from MOD09A1 image data collected from 2000 to 2017.

        <p>Water bodies larger than 25 km 2 in surface area were selected as the target water bodies in this study, where the Z SD model was applied to the high-quality MODIS 8-day surface reflectance data to obtain the water clarity in the summer months (i.e., from June to September). The four summer months were selected to avoid the influence of ice/snow cover on the lakes in north and west China. The mean summer Z SD for each year during the 18 year period and the mean 18-year climatological summer Z SD for every water body were estimated. When calculating the mean summer Z SD for each water body, if the water area in one image was less than 30% of the normal water mask, this water area was not used to calculate the average summer result due to lack of spatial representation. The normal water mask for each water body was obtained by overlaying the water masks segmented from MODIS images during the 18 years. If there were less than 3 valid images for one water body during the summer in one year, the average summer Z SD was not calculated for this water body in this year. Moreover, broken waters that were separated into parts by MODIS tiles, clouds, and image noise were merged using the normal water mask to calculate the mean summer value. In the long-term trend analysis, only water that had at least 12 years of valid mean summer Z SD values from 2000 to 2017 were included in the analysis for a reliable time-series analysis. With the criteria stated above, 65 lakes were removed from 218 extracted waters, and the remaining 153 waters were studied further. For the studied water bodies, we conducted linear regression against time over the mean summer Z SD values for each water body, where the associated slope was obtained as the change in the annual Z SD rate from 2000 to 2017. To determine if the increase or decrease was significant, the pvalues associated with the linear regression were also calculated, where statistically significant trends had p-values of less than 0.05. The study area was also divided into the east China and west China using the Heihe-Tengchong Line (H-T Line) geo-democratic demarcation line (Hu, 1990;Ge and Feng, 2008). Here the east China includes EPR, YGR and NER, and the west China includes QTR and MXR. The Z SD values at 69% of the lakes located in the west were greater than 2 m while 61% of the lakes located in the east were lower than 0.5 m (Fig. 7(d)). For the five geographic lake regions, lakes in the QTR showed high levels of Z SD , with an average value of 3.9 m, whereas lakes in the EPR exhibited low Z SD , with an average value of 0.6 m. Only two reservoirs (i.e., the Danjiangkou and Xin'anjiang Reservoirs) appeared to be clearer than 1 m of Z SD. All three studied lakes in the NER had the lowest level of Z SD , with an average value of 0.2 m while lakes in the MXR and YGR showed diverse Z SD values (Figs. 7(a) and (e)).Water bodies larger than 25 km 2 in surface area were selected as the target water bodies in this study, where the Z SD model was applied to the high-quality MODIS 8-day surface reflectance data to obtain the water clarity in the summer months (i.e., from June to September).

        <p>Fig. 8 shows a map of climatological summer Z SD for several typical large lakes. The water clarity spatial patterns in these lakes were manifested in the climatological maps. For example, for the majority of the lakes, the Z SD values were high in the central part of the lake and low near the shoreline. Estuary regions in Qinghai Lake and Namco Lake can be identified based on low values in the maps. In Taihu Lake, it was found a clarity gradient with low values on the western side and higher values on the eastern side. These results are consistent with previous studies (Feng et al., 2019b;Shi et al., 2018).Fig. 8 shows a map of climatological summer Z SD for several typical large lakes.

        <p>The mean summer Z SD of the 153 studied large lakes from 2000 to 2017 was derived using MODIS data following the procedures described in Section 3 and shown in Fig. 9, where the lakes in each lake region were arranged with annual change rate from low to high. The annual change rate of the mean summer Z SD between 2000 and 2017 for the studied lakes was mapped in Fig. 10, where lakes with statistically significant increases or decreases were marked. The average annual change rate of all studied lakes was 3.3 cm/yr, 4.1 cm/yr for lakes located west of the H-T Line, and only 0.2 cm/yr for lakes located east of the H-T Line. The results also revealed that 38.6% (59 in total) of all the lakes experienced a significant increase in water clarity during the last 18 years while only 8.5% (13 in total) of the lakes had a significant decreasing pattern in water clarity. Nevertheless, only 7 of the 72 lakes with significant annual changes in their Z SD were east of the H-T Line. Water clarity in 12.9% of the lakes located east of the H-T line had a significantly increasing trend while 9.7% showed a significantly decreasing trend (shown in Supplementary Material as Fig. S1). To the west of H-T Line, the percentages of lakes that had significant increasing or decreasing trends were 44.7% and 8.2%, respectively (shown in Supplementary Material as Fig. S1). This indicated that there was a weak changing trend in water clarity for large lakes east of the H-T Line while large lakes west of the H-T Line experienced a dramatic increase in water clarity from 2000 to 2017.The mean summer Z SD of the 153 studied large lakes from 2000 to 2017 was derived using MODIS data following the procedures described in Section 3 and shown in Fig. 9, where the lakes in each lake region were arranged with annual change rate from low to high.

        <p>For the five geographic lake regions, the mean summer Z SD values of the lakes increased drastically in the QTR during the analysis period (shown in Supplementary Material as Fig. S2). In the QTR, a number of large lakes, such as Namoco, Zhari Namco, and Geruco, experienced a significant increase (&gt; 10 cm/yr) in water clarity. However, Lake Qinghai and Lake Silingco, two well-known large lakes in the QTR, had significant decreases in their water clarity, with an annual decreasing rate of approximately -10 cm/yr. Increases in the mean summer Z SD were relative minor in the EPR, NER, and MXR. In the EPR, Lake Shijiu and Lake Nanhu exhibited significant decreases in water clarity, with an annual decreasing rate of approximately -2 cm/yr, while Danjiangkou Reservoir, Suyahu Reservoir, and Lake Nvshanhu were characterized by significant increases in water clarity, with annual increasing rates of 5.4, 1.2, and 0.6 cm/yr, respectively. In the NER, the Nanyin Reservoir showed a significant increase in water clarity with an annual change rate of 0.7 cm/yr. In the MXR, Lake Sayram was characterized by a significant increase in water clarity with an annual change rate of 6.0 cm/yr while Lake Ebinur, Lake Daihai, and Lake Hulun exhibited significant decreases with annual decreasing rates of -1.4, -0.6, and -0.4 cm/yr, respectively. The YGR, however, was the only region where the average lake Z SD experienced a decrease from 2000 to 2017 (shown in Supplementary as Fig. S2), especially Lake Chenghai, which showed a significant decrease in water clarity with an annual decrease rate of -3.7 cm/yr. Previous studies have reported similar results for lake clarity trends in the EPR and YGR (Feng et al., 2019a;Zhou et al., 2019).For the five geographic lake regions, the mean summer Z SD values of the lakes increased drastically in the QTR during the analysis period (shown in Supplementary Material as Fig. S2). In the QTR, a number of large lakes, such as Namoco, Zhari Namco, and Geruco, experienced a significant increase (&gt; 10 cm/yr) in water clarity. However, Lake Qinghai and Lake Silingco, two well-known large lakes in the QTR, had significant decreases in their water clarity, with an annual decreasing rate of approximately -10 cm/yr. Increases in the mean summer Z SD were relative minor in the EPR, NER, and MXR.

        <p>Good correlations between water color and water clarity have been observed in extensive measurements by groups over a wide range of inland and oceanic waters (Wang et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016;Garaba et al., 2015;Pitarch et al., 2019). Like water clarity, water color is also an indicator of the overall water quality, which will change with the overall amount of dissolved and suspended matter in water column (Wang et al., 2015;Pitarch et al., 2019). Based on the IOCCG simulated dataset (IOCCG, 2006), the relationship between water color and the OACs in water in terms of absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigment (a ph ), absorption coefficient of CDOM (a g ), absorption coefficient of detritus and minerals (a d ) was shown in Fig. 11. Although the changing slope is a little bit different for a ph , a g , a d , as a whole no matter which component dominated, the water color will change with total absorption coefficient of the water column (a total ) in a basically consistent exponent way (Fig. 11 (d)). More importantly, the changes of a specific component proportion in water would not significantly influence the relationship between Z SD and water color, as illustrated in Fig. 12, as long as the water color is not driven by one constituent. The backscattering of the OACs with the correlation coefficient decreased from 0.90 to 0.85 (Table 3). As the relationship is still 'empirical' at this stage, further analytical efforts and explanations are expected in future research. In fact, the new Z SD analytical model indicates that Z SD is determined by K d at the transparent window (K d tr ), and the transparent window is actually determined by the perceived water color (Lee et al., 2015), which implies the physical relation between Z SD and water chromaticity color. But we note that, in Fig. 11, the fitting effect between α and the absorption coefficients is not very good when the absorption coefficient is very high. It is probably due to the 'end-point' of natural water color which has been reported in Wang et al., 2015 that when one or more of the OACs are extremely high in water, the water color hue angle will tend to be saturated around 235°. This would potentially lead to an overestimation of Z SD in very turbid waters which will be further discussed in Section 5.2.Good correlations between water color and water clarity have been observed in extensive measurements by groups over a wide range of inland and oceanic waters (Wang et al., 2015;Li et al., 2016;Garaba et al., 2015;Pitarch et al., 2019).

        <p>To further answer the question of why use chromaticity parameters to estimate lake clarity, we compared the Z SD model developed in this paper with other published Z SD empirical models based on the in-situ R rs and Z SD dataset. The published Z SD empirical models included empirical algorithms based on band-ratio (Duan et al., 2009;Kratzer et al., 2008;Ren et al., 2018), single-band (Binding et al., 2015;Shi et al., 2018) and band combinations (Olmanson et al., 2016;Olmanson et al., 2008). The models were tuned and optimized to fit the in-situ dataset. This in-situ R rs and Z SD dataset was not used to develop the model in this paper because it contains very few R rs data from relative clear lakes (only 15 samplings in Qinghai Lake), which seems to be lack of the representativeness in clear lakes. It shows that the FUI and α-based algorithm proposed in this study outperformed other empirical models with MRD of 25.8% and MAD of 0.08 m (Fig. 13). Model based on FUI itself also achieved good performance with the MRD of 26.5% and MAD of 0.11 m, but slightly worse than the hybrid model, which confirmed the respective suitable range of FUI and α for Z SD estimation. Although the parameters in the Z SD model (as shown in Fig. 13 (a)) are a little different with that developed in Section 3.2 after optimizing with the in-situ R rs and Z SD dataset, the model developed in Section 3.2 can also produce better results for this dataset than other models with MRD of 26.1% and MAD of 0.09 m. In the rest models, the Red-to-Green band ratio models optimized from Duan et al. (2009) and Ren et al. (2018) generally had good performances with MRD of 28%-29% and MAD of 0.10-0.13 m. Besides, there were general over-estimations when Z SD &lt; 0.1 m, which means that when the water is extremely turbid, the sensitivity of water color, single band, band ratio, etc. to Z SD will decrease. The comparison results indicated that water chromaticity parameters (FUI and α) can better estimate Z SD in a wide range than other empirical models. Moreover, FUI and α have high tolerance to the atmospheric perturbations and observation conditions (Wang et al., 2018), which further promote the use of FUI and α for Z SD estimation over various types of inland waters across large regions where accurate atmospheric correction is still very difficult to tackle at present.To further answer the question of why use chromaticity parameters to estimate lake clarity, we compared the Z SD model developed in this paper with other published Z SD empirical models based on the in-situ R rs and Z SD dataset.

        <p>Over recent decades, there have been a growing number of radiometric measurements for water quality variables via satellites. Remote sensing of water quality variables is based on the concept that variations in water constituents can change the spectrum of water color (IOCCG, 2018). Due to the special characteristics of inland waters, two main issues must be addressed when deriving water quality at large scales using remote sensing technology: adaptability of the algorithm to various optical water types (OWTs) and atmospheric correction.Over recent decades, there have been a growing number of radiometric measurements for water quality variables via satellites.

        <p>In this study, good relationships have been found between Z SD and FUI and α over a wide range of Z SD based on three types of datasets: simulated dataset, in-situ dataset, and MODIS match-up dataset. In Section 5.1, the intrinsic relationship between Z SD and FUI and α have been discussed and the advantages of FUI and α-based Z SD model have been shown through comparing with other published models. These together demonstrate the generalization capacities of this FUI and αbased algorithm over lakes in a variety of conditions and optical types. Like other OWT-based algorithms (Neil et al., 2019), it can achieve a better overall accuracy compared with algorithms developed for specific waters.In this study, good relationships have been found between Z SD and FUI and α over a wide range of Z SD based on three types of datasets: simulated dataset, in-situ dataset, and MODIS match-up dataset.

        <p>The estimation model was merged by the FUI and α because the FUI contains relatively coarse colors when it is smaller than 8 and α is a good alternative in this range to describe variations in the water clarity, which have been also observed in ocean waters (Pitarch et al., 2019). Our results also showed that using FUI or α alone for Z SD estimation can also achieve good performances, but not as robust as the hybrid model,The estimation model was merged by the FUI and α because the FUI contains relatively coarse colors when it is smaller than 8 and α is a good alternative in this range to describe variations in the water clarity, which have been also observed in ocean waters (Pitarch et al., 2019).

That is to say, when water color is green or yellow, a change of FUI can better represent the change of water clarity, but when water color is blue, a change of hue angle α is better. Nevertheless, we expect that there are some uncertainties when applying the model to such a wide range of datasets from various types of lakes. We observed that there is a slight overestimation of the estimated Z SD when Z SD is very small (&lt; 0.1 m) for both the in-situ dataset and validation dataset (as shown in Fig. 4 (d), Fig. 5 and Fig. 13). This is likely due to the "end-point" (~235°) of hue angle in natural waters where one or more of the components reach extreme high values, which have been reported in previous studies (Wang et al., 2015). Under these extreme conditions, the Z SD will be less than 0.1 m and water color is unlikely to further change with Z SD .Correlation and partial correlation coefficient between hue angle α and Z SD while controlling for one or more color components in water, in terms of absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigment (a ph ), absorption coefficient of CDOM (a g ), absorption coefficient of detritus and minerals (a d ), backscattering coefficient of detritus and minerals (bb d ) and backscattering coefficient of Chl-a (bb ch ), based on the IOCCG simulated dataset. which confirmed the respective suitable range of FUI and α in estimating Z SD .

        <p>Besides, we note that the FUI and α can only describe the dominant color wavelength but they lose information on color purity. A recent study has shown that color purity is also sensitive to water quality (Shen et al., 2019), which may further support water clarity retrieval in future studies.Besides, we note that the FUI and α can only describe the dominant color wavelength but they lose information on color purity.

        <p>The MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09) was selected as the satellite data source in this study which have been proven to be applicable to water quality mapping in many inland waters (Hou et al., 2017;Li et al., 2016). A correction method for MOD09 proposed in Wang et al. (2016) was used to reduce the remaining noises and derive R rs by subtracting a minimum value in near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The validity of the subtraction logic was also demonstrated in other studies to derive R rs from Rayleigh-corrected MODIS reflectance (Feng et al., 2018b). In addition, we found that the data quality of daily MOD09 data (MOD09GA) was not as good as that of the 8-day composite MOD09 data (MOD09A1), as more invalid negative values were occurred in MOD09GA, especially at pixels near cloud covers and at clear lakes in west China. It is because the MOD09A1 data is selected as the best possible reflectance observation of MOD09GA data during the 8-day period at the pixel level with the criteria including cloud and solar zenith (Vermote, 2015). That is why we use the 8-day MOD09A1 data other than 1-day MOD09GA data for the long-term water clarity observation and analysis in this study. But in order to narrow the match-up window in the model development, we still use the daily MOD09GA data to build the match-ups after removing pixels containing clouds and other noises. The consistency between the 1-day MOD09GA and 8-day MOD09A1 data in the long-term Z SD estimation was demonstrated and shown in Supplementary as Fig. S3. Another reason for using the MOD09 data is that it is a long-term time series from 2000 to the present, which is not the case for certain new sensors. With the improved radiometric calibration of all MODIS Terra products, which account for the sensor degradation, the long term change analyses based on MODIS Terra have been demonstrated in a number of studies (Hou et al., 2017;Wu et al., 2008). But we also note that the 8-day composite MOD09A1 data would be not suitable for studies which intend to explore the daily dynamics of lakes considering its coarse temporal resolution. New satellite sensors with finer temporal resolution and spatial resolution may bring more advantages to water quality monitoring and enable more detailed monitoring over lakes where the changes are more rapid and local compared to open oceans. More importantly, it has been proven in many studies that the derivation of the FUI and α from MODIS or other sensors is very robust (an accuracy of ~90%) (Lehmann et al., 2018;Van der Woerd and Wernand, 2018;Wang et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2018), which can eliminate errors in the remote sensing reflectance product, taking advantage of the normalization process in calculation (Wang et al., 2018). The FUI and α retrieval algorithm has a high tolerance to the spectral resolution of satellite images (Van der Woerd and Wernand, 2018). Hence, the broad visible bands of MODIS can be used to estimate Z SD . This advantage of the FUI and α can also bridge the gap between low spectral sensors and the new high spectral sensors for Z SD estimation (Van der Woerd and Wernand, 2018). Therefore, it may be possible to extend Z SD mapping to archived satellite data, such as the Landsat series data.The MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09) was selected as the satellite data source in this study which have been proven to be applicable to water quality mapping in many inland waters (Hou et al., 2017;Li et al., 2016).

        <p>Our results show that there is a distinct "high west and low east" spatial pattern and overall ever-increasing water clarity in the past two decades across China. Although several lakes experienced a significant decrease in water clarity, such as Qinghai Lake and Hulun Lake, more lakes tended to increase. Agreeing with our results, previous studies have shown that lake water quality has increased in China during the last twenty years (Feng et al., 2019a;Zhou et al., 2019), although no studies have investigated nationwide changes in lake water clarity.Our results show that there is a distinct "high west and low east" spatial pattern and overall ever-increasing water clarity in the past two decades across China.

        <p>To explore the environmental factors that relate to the spatial patterns of lake clarity across China, we examined the relationships between the mean climatological summer Z SD and local environmental factors. The results showed that both lake AL and WD had a significant positive correlation with the mean summer Z SD (R 2 = 0.31 and 0.58, respectively), as lakes in west China generally have higher altitude and deeper water compared with those in east China. More importantly, deep waters are unlikely affected by bottom sediment resuspension events (Binding et al., 2015). Lake SA did not have a significant correlation with water clarity. A small number of large lakes in east China are eutrophic and turbid, such as Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, and Xingkai Lake, while large lakes in west China, such as Namco Lake and Selingco Lake, are quite clear (Li et al., 2016).To explore the environmental factors that relate to the spatial patterns of lake clarity across China, we examined the relationships between the mean climatological summer Z SD and local environmental factors.

        <p>Local AT and PR showed significant negative correlations with the mean climatological summer Z SD (R 2 = 0.26 and 0.15, respectively), suggesting that turbid lakes are common in areas of high temperature and precipitation throughout China, such as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the EPR. This is in consistent with previous studies which have illustrated that high air temperature may promote algal growth and then decrease water clarity (Chen et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2019), while more precipitation may cause more sediment and nutrient loadings into lakes (Rose et al., 2017). In contrast, no significant correlations were found among WS, NDVI, and the mean summer Z SD , illustrating that these parameters are not the main factors that affect the water clarity spatial patterns across China. For the anthropogenic factors, the mean climatological summer Z SD had a negative correlation with local PO and GDP (R 2 = 0.26 and 0.20, respectively), suggesting that lakes in provinces with high population and GDP tend to be turbid. This agrees well with previous studies (Cao et al., 2017;Borkman and Smayda, 1998) as population and GDP are indicators of anthropogenic interference. In general, the distinct high west and low east pattern in water clarity was found to be associated with the apparent differences in water depth, altitude, air temperature, precipitation, GDP, and population in west versus east China, separated by the H-T line, as shown in Fig. 14. Lake geographic factors, such as water depth and lake altitude, are the likely leading factors for this spatial pattern while meteorological and anthropogenic factors also contribute to a certain degree.Local AT and PR showed significant negative correlations with the mean climatological summer Z SD (R 2 = 0.26 and 0.15, respectively), suggesting that turbid lakes are common in areas of high temperature and precipitation throughout China, such as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the EPR.

        <p>Significant changes in global climate have been observed over the past century and imposed direct and indirect impacts on lake ecosystems through the hydrological cycle (Bates et al., 2008). Changes in temperature, precipitation, wind, glaciers, and snow cover have been documented as drivers of water quality dynamics and water pollution via nutrients, sediments, dissolved organic carbon, pathogens, pesticides, and salt (O'Reilly et al., 2003). However, our understanding of the effects that climate variables have on both aquatic ecosystem functions and water clarity across large regions remains limited.Significant changes in global climate have been observed over the past century and imposed direct and indirect impacts on lake ecosystems through the hydrological cycle (Bates et al., 2008).

        <p>To preliminarily explore the responses of lake clarity interannual variability to climate change from 2000 to 2017, we conducted correlation analyses between the long-term mean summer Z SD and local meteorological factors (i.e. AT, PR, and WS), together with corresponding lake geographic factor (i.e., lake SA). Lake depth was not considered here due to the lack of long-term data for these two parameters. But studies have shown that changes in lake water depth or water level have a direct link with changes in lake surface area (Wu et al., 2019), such that changes in the lake SA can also represent, to a certain extent, the changes in the water level. As shown in Fig. 15, stronger correlations were observed between changes in the long-term water clarity and AT and SA. Correlation coefficients were generally weaker for WS, PR, and NDVI. The overall correlations between these factors and changes in the interannual water clarity also varied across the five lake regions. We note that Fig. 17 also showed the correlations between lake clarity and anthropogenic factors (GDP and PO), but these two factors were not considered for lakes in the QTR and MXR, where human activity is generally weak.To preliminarily explore the responses of lake clarity interannual variability to climate change from 2000 to 2017, we conducted correlation analyses between the long-term mean summer Z SD and local meteorological factors (i.e. AT, PR, and WS), together with corresponding lake geographic factor (i.e., lake SA).

        <p>In the 52 lakes with significant increasing Z SD in QTR, most of the lakes had positive correlations with both AT and SA. Moreover, 30 of the 52 lakes had significant positive correlations with AT, and 24 of them had significant positive correlations with SA, suggesting the positive effect of the two factors on lake clarity change in QTR. Studies have shown that climate warming have resulted in water level rise at lakes in QTR due to increasing meltwater from glaciers and permafrost in the cold regions (Wan et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2011). Water level rise then would lead to the increase in water clarity by diluting the dissolved and suspended matter in lakes (Li et al., 2016). Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Material showed the long-term changes in water clarity in Lake Namco, along with the variations in the water level (acquired from Wu et al., 2019), SA, and AT, which further confirmed that the rise in the water level is associated with the increase of temperature. In contrast, in the 7 lakes with significant decreasing trend in QTR, most of them had negative correlations with AT and SA. This is probably due to the sediments carried by meltwater that will decrease the lake clarity, such as the case in Lake Silingco (Mi et al., 2019). Alternatively, the lake clarity may be impacted by higher temperature which can accelerate the growth of phytoplankton in relative warm area of QTR, such as the case in Lake Qinghai (Feng et al., 2019b).In the 52 lakes with significant increasing Z SD in QTR, most of the lakes had positive correlations with both AT and SA.

        <p>In MXR, SA had significant positive correlations with 4 lakes including 1 with significant decreasing trend and 1 with significant increasing trend, implying lake clarity is usually positively linked to water level of the lake in this region.In MXR, SA had significant positive correlations with 4 lakes including 1 with significant decreasing trend and 1 with significant increasing trend, implying lake clarity is usually positively linked to water level of the lake in this region.</p>
        <p>In the east (including EPR, YGR and NER), AT generally had negative correlations with most lakes, among which 9 lakes were significant negatively correlated, which is consistent with previous studies that high temperature can accelerate the growth of phytoplankton and result in decreases in the water clarity in many lakes in east China (Chen et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2019). But these significant correlated lakes were not those had significant changing trend in water clarity, illustrating other factors may have larger effect on lake clarity in the east, such as GDP and PO which will be analyzed in Section 5.5. SA also generally had positively correlations with lake clarity in the east, among which significant 7 lakes were significant positively correlated. Besides, NDVI showed significant positive correlations with water clarity change in 9 lakes in EPR and NER, which was explained in relevant studies that the vegetation cover may reduce the suspended sediment discharged into lakes (Feng et al., 2019a).In the east (including EPR, YGR and NER), AT generally had negative correlations with most lakes, among which 9 lakes were significant negatively correlated, which is consistent with previous studies that high temperature can accelerate the growth of phytoplankton and result in decreases in the water clarity in many lakes in east China (Chen et al., 2013;Zhou et al., 2019).

        <p>After the 1970s, China has experienced rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population expansion during the last half-century, especially in east China. On one hand, the socioeconomic development has caused a series of water quality degradation and pollution issues, which have been documented in many studies in China, such as the frequent algal blooms in Chaohu Lake and Taihu Lake starting from the late 1980s especially in 2007, and continuous algal blooms in Dianchi Lake around 2000 (Chen et al., 2013;Gao and Yan, 2002;Hu et al., 2010;Huang and Shu, 1997;Le et al., 2010;Zhang et al., 1999;Zhao et al., 2018). On the other hand, to control the water pollution, a full range of forceful regulation and water treatment projects have been taken by local and national governments in China mainly after 2000s with billions of money invested (Meng et al., 2015;Zhou, 2010). Hence, the correlations between the human activity factors, i.e. GDP and PO, and the lake clarity change between 2000 and 2017 were discussed below to preliminarily reveal the general relationship between economic development and lake quality change in the past two decades in the east China.After the 1970s, China has experienced rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population expansion during the last half-century, especially in east China.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 15, we found 63.3% of the lakes showed positive correlations with local GDP growth in EPR, NER and YGR, and all the 4 lakes with significant increasing trend in water clarity had significant positive correlations with local GDP growth. However, there were ~25% lakes whose clarity had negative correlations with GDP growth in east China, in which all the 3 lakes with significant decreasing trend in water clarity in the east had significant negative correlations with the GDP growth, illustrating the negative effect of local GDP growth on lake clarity change in some regions in the east. Fig. 16 shows three examples of lake in the EPR with the long-term changing curves of the mean summer Z SD and the major correlated factors. These three aquatic systems (including the Danjiangkou Reservoir, Suyahu Reservoirs and Nanyin Reservoir) are reservoirs that operate as drinking water resources for local municipalities. In Suyahu Reservoir, a sudden increase of lake Z SD was found from 2009 to 2012, which appeared to be related to the environmental management and forced shutdown of heavily polluting industries by the local government (http://henan.people.com.cn/n2/2017/0126/c351638-29648322.html). In Danjiangkou Reservoir, Fig. 19(b) shows that SA followed the changes of lake Z SD , with a sharp increase for both the Z SD and SA between 2014 and 2015, which further support that the SA is acting as a proxy for the dilution process associated with water level rise. This is likely due to the opening of the South-North Water Transfer Project central route in December 2014(Lei et al., 2018). In Nanyin Reservoir, fluctuations in Z SD between 2007 and 2010 appeared to be related to the reinforcement project initiated in Nanyin Reservoir during this period (Jiang and Zheng, 2011), and it can be seen that the water Z SD remained at a higher In general, these implies the effectiveness of water quality regulation for lakes in east China, and give evidence of GDP growth's positive role on lake clarity increase in industrializing and urbanizing areas through supporting effective water resource management and pollution control measures, although this effect is indirect and relying on the good governance and balance of industrialization and environmental management. Agreeing with our results, recent studies have recognized the signs of water quality recovery in several Chinese lakes as a result of continuous treatment and management supported by local and national governments (Guo et al., 2015;He et al., 2015;Feng et al., 2019a;Zhao et al., 2018). But we found these lakes with significantly increasing trend were generally small reservoirs, which means the regulation and management deployed for reservoirs were stronger than that for natural lakes. Besides, a small portion of lakes (~25%), including the 3 significant decreasing lakes in the east, were still negatively impacted by the local GDP growth, suggesting effective water managements are still required in some area.As shown in Fig. 15, we found 63.3% of the lakes showed positive correlations with local GDP growth in EPR, NER and YGR, and all the 4 lakes with significant increasing trend in water clarity had significant positive correlations with local GDP growth.

        <p>For the factor of PO, it was positively correlated with the lake clarity change in most lakes, but the effect of local PO on lake clarity seems vague and not obvious. We note that climate, lake water, biophysical, and socio-economic systems are interconnected in complex ways (Maberly and Elliott, 2012;Williamson et al., 2009). Our study just provides preliminary analyses and discussions on the simple correlations between climate change and human activity on regional lake clarity. Systematic interactions and responses of water quality in regional and global lakes to climatic and anthropogenic changes remain to be studied in future studies by bridging the gap between water color satellite remote sensing and biogeochemical/ecosystem modelling (IOCCG, 2020).For the factor of PO, it was positively correlated with the lake clarity change in most lakes, but the effect of local PO on lake clarity seems vague and not obvious.

        <p>In this study, we developed and validated an FUI and α-based model to estimate Z SD for large lakes across China based on in-situ measurements and synchronous MODIS imagery. Compared with other empirical Z SD models, this FUI and α-based model demonstrates superior performance (MRD = 27.4%) and adaptability for lakes over a wide range of clarity and trophic states. This benefits from the stable and satisfactory relationship between water color (i.e., FUI and α) and Z SD over a wide range, supported by both in-situ and simulation datasets.In this study, we developed and validated an FUI and α-based model to estimate Z SD for large lakes across China based on in-situ measurements and synchronous MODIS imagery.

        <p>Subsequently, the spatial patterns and long-term variations in Z SD for large lakes (N = 153) across China from 2000 to 2017 were investigated and recognized using MODIS with the proposed model. Based on the MODIS retrieved results, a spatial pattern of "high west and low east" was observed for the lakes across China, with an everincreasing pattern in water clarity from 2000 to 2017 for the majority of the lakes, especially in west China. It was found that the average annual change rate of all lakes was 3.3 cm/yr, where 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in water clarity during the past eighteen years, whereas only 8.5% (N = 13) of the lakes had a significantly decreasing trend. Furthermore, the environmental factors that may potentially affect this spatio-temporal pattern were preliminarily analyzed and discussed in terms of the correlations between Z SD and lake geographic, local climate, and anthropogenic factors. Spatially, the variation patterns in lake clarity across China was found to be associated with distinct differences in lake depth and altitude between east and west China while air temperature, precipitation, population, and GDP distribution also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, it showed that changes in the lake surface area and water level are possibly the direct factors that drive changes in lake clarity. In west China, the dramatic increase of lake clarity was observed to be positively correlated to the increase of the water surface area which is linked to climate warming. In east China, however, the small overall increases of lake clarity might be influenced by the combined effects of vegetation cover growth, climate warming and water resource management over recent decades. Specifically, we found that GDP growth generally showed positive correlations with increases in water clarity in most lakes in east China, which implied the effectiveness of water management practices that had already been enacted. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at broad scales and over long term.Subsequently, the spatial patterns and long-term variations in Z SD for large lakes (N = 153) across China from 2000 to 2017 were investigated and recognized using MODIS with the proposed model.
