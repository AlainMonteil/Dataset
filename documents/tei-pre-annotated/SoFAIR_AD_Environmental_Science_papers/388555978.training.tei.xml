        <p>Surface wipe samples from the glass sheets deployed in the kitchen were acquired and analyzed daily for nitrite during the HOMEChem campaign in June 2018. The procedure follows the method described previously (17). In brief, surface samples were collected by wiping the glass with nylon membrane filters (47 mm; Whatman 7404-004) and kept in the dark before analysis. The filters were subsequently (on the same day) extracted in deionized water (18.2 MΩ) and analyzed for nitrite concentration using the Griess assay (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes G-7921) with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, USB2000+UV-VIS-ES) with a waveguide capillary cell (World Precision Instruments,.Surface wipe samples from the glass sheets deployed in the kitchen were acquired and analyzed daily for nitrite during the HOMEChem campaign in June 2018.

        <p>Measurement was at λ = 548 nm. A calibration curve was derived from measurement of absorbance for NaNO 2 solutions using the Griess assay following the same procedure. An average surface concentration on the order of 10 12 molecules cm -2 during HOMEChem campaign was detected. This result should be considered a lower limit, considering collection efficiency less than unity and possible loss of nitrite during analysis. This surface concentration is in agreement with measurement for different surfaces in a Toronto residence (17).Measurement was at λ = 548 nm.

        <p>Consider the indoor abundance of a species in three compartments: air, sorbed in a weakly-polar organic reservoir, and partitioned into a polar reservoir. The equilibrium abundance in these three states can be expressed in relation to two thermodynamic constants and three volumes. Specifically, the fraction of a chemical in indoor air, weakly-polar organic and polar reservoirs (F gas , F org , and F p ) at equilibrium can be calculated from the following equations F gas = 1/(1 + K oa V org /V gas + K wa V p /V gas ) Eq.

        <p>C1-C5 monocarboxylic acids were calibrated with their corresponding n-acid standards. It is possible that some of the intensity in these signals is attributable to branched acids, in addition to the straight chain acids for which the calibration was conducted. The calibration was carried out weekly during the campaign using permeation tubes (VICI, Dynacal) with known emission rates at controlled temperatures (40 °C) in dry zero air. Calibration for HONO was conducted before and after the campaign using a custom-built HONO source following the method described previously (17). In brief, a known flow of gas-phase HONO was collected by bubbling into deionized water (18.2 MΩ), which was subsequently analyzed for aqueous phase nitrite with UV-vis spectrometry following the Griess assay (17, 52). A HONO calibration was also conducted daily on-site during the field campaign by collecting gas-phase HONO from a known flow of indoor air bubbled through deionized water (18.2 MΩ) and analyzed similarly with the Griess assay. The overall sensitivity of the instrument was obtained by averaging the sensitivity from the on-site calibration, and the pre-and post-campaign calibrations. HNCO calibrations were obtained after the campaign using a custom-built HNCO source described elsewhere (34). The influence of humidity on the mass spectral sensitivities of HONO, HNCO and formic acid was confirmed to be minor (48). Overall, we estimate that the systematic uncertainties in the reported mixing ratios are ± 20% for HONO and HNCO, and ± 10% for the other species.C1-C5 monocarboxylic acids were calibrated with their corresponding n-acid standards.
