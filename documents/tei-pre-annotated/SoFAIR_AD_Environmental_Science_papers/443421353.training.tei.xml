        <p>The aim of this work was to study the redox-induced mobilization of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in the dissolved, colloidal, and sediment phase of a mining soil treated and untreated with biochar as affected by the redox potential (E H ) -dependent changes of soil pH, dissolved organic carbon, Fe, Mn and S. The experiment was conducted stepwise at two E H cycles (+200 mV → -30 mV → +333 mV → 0 mV) using biogeochemical microcosm. Silver was abundant in the colloidal fraction in both cycles, indicating that Ag might be associated with colloids under different redox conditions. Antimony, Sn and Tl were abundant in the colloidal fraction in the first cycle and in the dissolved fraction in the second cycle, which indicates that they are retained by colloids under oxic acidic conditions and released under reducing alkaline conditions. Release of dissolved Sb, Sn, and Tl was governed positively by pH, Fe, S, and dissolved aromatic compounds. Biochar mitigated Ag release, but promoted Sb, Sn, and Tl mobilization, which might be due to the wider range of E H (-12 to +333) and pH (4.9-8.1) in the biochar treated soil than the un-treated soil (E H = -30 to +218; pH = 5.9-8.6). Also, the biochar surface functional groups may act as electron donors for the Sb, Sn, and Tl reduction reactions, and thus biochar may play an important role in reducing Tl 3+ to Tl + , Sb 5+ to Sb 3+ , and Sn 4+ to Sn 2+ , which increase their solubility under reducing conditions as compared to oxic conditions. Thallium and Sb exhibit higher potential mobility in the solid phase than Sn and Ag. Biochar increased the potential mobility of Sb, Sn, and Tl under oxic acidic conditions. The results improve our understanding of the redox-driven mobilization of these contaminants in soils.The aim of this work was to study the redox-induced mobilization of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in the dissolved, colloidal, and sediment phase of a mining soil treated and untreated with biochar as affected by the redox potential (E H ) -dependent changes of soil pH, dissolved organic carbon, Fe, Mn and S.

        <p>Soil contamination by potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is globally of serious concern due to high risks to human and ecosystem health (Antoniadis et al., 2017;Rinklebe et al., 2019). Antimony (Sb), silver (Ag), tin (Sn), and thallium (Tl) are considered as emerging contaminants and toxic for human, animals, microorganisms and plants. For example, the toxicity of Tl is higher compared to Hg, Cd and Pb (Eqani et al., 2018). Antimony has been considered as a priority pollutant by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and by the European Union (Eqani et al., 2018;Al and Viraraghavan, 2005). These elements are redox-sensitive; therefore, their mobilization in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105754 Received 3 December 2019; Received in revised form 16 April 2020; Accepted 19 April 2020 natural systems is largely controlled by redox potential (E H ) (Couture et al., 2015;Nakamaru and Altansuvd, 2014). Redox-induced release of dissolved concentrations of PTEs including Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in wetland soils, waterlogged sediments, and rice paddy soils is of increasing interest and has broader implications, due to the high potential risks to human health (Rinklebe et al., 2016a(Rinklebe et al., , b, 2017(Rinklebe et al., , 2019)). For example, the redox-induced release of these emerging pollutants may cause an increase leaching to the ground water and thus may increase their transfer from soils to plant and food chain. In particular, Tl and Sb are responsible for many accidental, occupational, deliberate, and therapeutic poisonings (Al and Viraraghavan, 2005). Therefore, the fascinating chemistry and high toxicity potential of Sb and Tl and their compounds lead to the large scientific interest and high relevance for environmental and human health.Soil contamination by potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is globally of serious concern due to high risks to human and ecosystem health (Antoniadis et al., 2017;Rinklebe et al., 2019).

        <p>However, little is known about the redox-induced release of Ag and Sn, while few studies detail the release mechanisms of Sb (e.g., Hockmann et al., 2014;Han et al., 2018;Frohne et al., 2011) and Tl (e.g., Antić et al., 2017;Jia et al., 2018) in flooded soils. Nevertheless, those studies focused on the dissolved fractions of Sb and Tl while the concentrations of those elements in the colloidal fraction were not measured. Because there are large differences in toxicity among the different forms of Sb, Sn, and Tl (e.g., Tl 3+ is much more toxic than Tl + (Jia et al., 2018;Ralph and Twiss, 2002), a thorough understanding of the redox transformations of these elements and of their redox-dependent fate in soils is required in order to evaluate the potential associated risks. Unlike with some of other PTEs found in terrestrial environments, information about what controls the redox chemistry of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in soils remains scarce (Jia et al., 2018;Al-Najar et al., 2005).However, little is known about the redox-induced release of Ag and Sn, while few studies detail the release mechanisms of Sb (e.g., Hockmann et al., 2014;Han et al., 2018;Frohne et al., 2011) and Tl (e.g., Antić et al., 2017;Jia et al., 2018) in flooded soils.

        <p>Biochar (BC) can be used to remediate soils contaminated with PTEs (Palansooriya et al., 2020); however, biochar application to contaminated soils can cause contradictory effects on elemental mobilization depending on the soil redox conditions (Yuan et al., 2017). Functional groups in biochar may contribute to its redox characteristics (Yuan et al., 2017;Klüpfel et al., 2014). The dissolved organic matter extracted from biochar can act as both electron donor and acceptor, reducing and oxidizing the elements (Yuan et al., 2017;Dong et al 2014). Also, the pyrolysis temperature of biochar affects significantly its redox characteristics and the redox-meditated interactions between biochar and PTEs in soils (Awad et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2018). Only few researchers (e.g. Rinklebe et al., 2016a;Beiyuan et al., 2017) addressed the effects of biochar amendment on the (im)mobilization of PTEs under dynamic redox conditions. However, these studies were dedicated solely to the fate of dissolved concentrations of PTEs; the colloidal fraction was not investigated, and the emerging contaminants Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl were not studied.Biochar (BC) can be used to remediate soils contaminated with PTEs (Palansooriya et al., 2020); however, biochar application to contaminated soils can cause contradictory effects on elemental mobilization depending on the soil redox conditions (Yuan et al., 2017).

        <p>Colloids are operationally defined as particles between 2 and 10 µm in diameter (e.g., de Jonge et al., 2004), and include layer silicates, sesquioxides (Fe-and Al-oxyhydroxides), organic macromolecules, and bacteria, and viruses. Mobilization of soil colloids has attracted much research attention from agro-environmental point of view, because of colloids' potential to facilitate transport of sorbed contaminants and nutrients. Although effect of colloids on the sorption of trace elements has been reported (Shaheen et al., 2013), its impact on redox-mobilization of emerging contaminates such as Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl is not studied yet. Our previous studies (El-Naggar et al., 2018;El-Naggar et al., 2019) focused on other elements such as As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Se, and Zn. Thus, to our best knowledge, the redox-induced release of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl, in particular with respect to their concentrations in three phases of soil (the dissolved, colloidal, and the solid-phase) as affected by application of biochar, has never been tested. A proper understanding of biogeochemistry of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in soils is very limited particularly under dynamic reducing-oxidizing conditions. Therefore, detailed knowledge about the redox-behavior of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in soils is required to understand their mobilization processes and enable a more accurate prediction of their release into waters in response to changing redox conditions. It is also essential to understand the redox-driven mobilization of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in soil so that their potential hazard can be better predicted.Colloids are operationally defined as particles between 2 and 10 µm in diameter (e.g., de Jonge et al., 2004), and include layer silicates, sesquioxides (Fe-and Al-oxyhydroxides), organic macromolecules, and bacteria, and viruses.

        <p>We hypothesize that dynamic redox cycles in soil may (im)mobilize the redox-sensitive contaminants Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl and redistribute them among the dissolved and colloidal fractions, due to changes in E H values, and/or the E H -dependent changes of governing factors such as soil pH, dissolved aliphatic and aromatic compounds of organic carbon and the chemistry of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) (hydr)oxides, sulfur (S), and chloride (Cl -). To support our hypothesis, we assume that the oscillations from oxidizing to reducing conditions and vice versa in the soil govern the release of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl and their solubility in a mining wetland soil. We also hypothesize that application of biochar would increase the capacity of a soil to accept and/or donate electrons by controlling electron transfer reactions, and thus lead to a wider range of E H in the soil slurry (Awad et al., 2018), which in turn may affect the associated governing factors (soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe, Mn, and S) and, consequently, the mobilization of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl and their distribution in the dissolved and colloidal fractions as compared to the untreated soil.We hypothesize that dynamic redox cycles in soil may (im)mobilize the redox-sensitive contaminants Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl and redistribute them among the dissolved and colloidal fractions, due to changes in E H values, and/or the E H -dependent changes of governing factors such as soil pH, dissolved aliphatic and aromatic compounds of organic carbon and the chemistry of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) (hydr)oxides, sulfur (S), and chloride (Cl -).

        <p>Mining soils are distributed world-wide and are often contaminated by PTEs. Large areas of mining soils can be flooded periodically and cultivated by rice. In our study, the soil was collected from a mining area at Hubei province in China. Hubei is located in the agricultural transition zone between the wheat-growing North and the rice-growing South; it is one of China's leading rice-producing provinces. The average annual rainfall in Hubei Province is between 800 and 1600 mm. This soil might be flooded either during rice cultivation season or as a result of the heavy rains. Therefore, the scientific background of our study is to investigate the redox-induced mobilization of toxic elements in the soil when it will be flooded. Within this context we hypothesize that the periodic inundation of the soil may affect the release dynamics of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl due to the changes of E H /pH-values and the above mentioned controlling factors.Mining soils are distributed world-wide and are often contaminated by PTEs.

        <p>To verify our hypotheses, we quantified the impact of pre-defined redox conditions on the release dynamics of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in the dissolved and colloidal fractions and on their potential mobility in the solid-phase of a mining soil as affected by addition of rice hull biochar. We also determined the associations between the concentrations of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl and controlling factors (E H , pH, DOC, Fe, Mn, S, and Cl -) and identified the complex cause-and-effect interrelationships using factor analysis.To verify our hypotheses, we quantified the impact of pre-defined redox conditions on the release dynamics of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in the dissolved and colloidal fractions and on their potential mobility in the solid-phase of a mining soil as affected by addition of rice hull biochar.

        <p>The biochar was produced from rice hull by DAEWON GSI Company, Korea. Awad et al. (2018) reported that biochar produced at a high pyrolysis temperature (e.g., 550 °C) may cause larger redox alterations in soil slurry compared to one produced at a lower temperature (e.g., 300 °C). Accordingly, we chose a biochar produced with a high pyrolysis temperature (500 °C). Following pyrolysis, the biochar was prepared for characterization and soil mixing experiments by grinding in a mortar and passing through a 2-mm sieve. The product was characterized for ash, carbon, moisture, and volatile matter content using a muffle furnace (MF21GS, JEIO TECH, Korea) and an elemental analyzer (Eurovector, Redavalle, Italy). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 with ISIS 310, Japan) was used to investigate the morphology and size of biochar particles. The structural features and surface functionality of the biochar were further determined by: 1) Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (K-Alpha, ThermoFisher, USA), 2) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Frontier, PerkinElmer, USA), and 3) Raman spectrometer (ARAMIS, Horiba Jobin, Japan). Chemical properties of the biochar are presented in the supporting information (Appendix A in Table S2).

        <p>The soil was treated with rice hull biochar at the rate of 5% (w/w). Both the un-treated soil and biochar-treated soil were incubated in the laboratory at 70% of the water-holding capacity for six weeks. At the end of the incubation period, the un-treated soil and biochar-treated soil were air-dried, crushed, and passed through a 2-mm sieve, characterized, and used for the subsequent redox experiments. The untreated soil and biochar-treated soil, as well as certified reference soils, were digested by HCl and HNO 3 using a microwave (Milestone; ETHOS EASY, Germany) for the determination of the pseudo-total element concentrations (USEPA, 2007).The soil was treated with rice hull biochar at the rate of 5% (w/w).

        <p>An automated biogeochemical microcosm system (MC) was employed to simulate the flooding of the un-treated soil and biochartreated soil in the laboratory by controlling the redox conditions. This specialized equipment enabled us to adjust the E H to pre-defined conditions, which allows for the simulation of various oxic/anoxic cycles that may occur in natural wetlands. Technical details of this set-up are reported in Yu and Rinklebe. (2011). This system has been successfully utilized in previous studies on the release dynamics of PTEs in soils (e.g., Rinklebe et al., 2016a,b;Shaheen et al., 2014, 2016, Shaheen et al., 2020;Frohne et al., 2011;El-Naggar et al., 2019). Briefly, eight MC vessels were used for the un-treated soil and biochar-treated soil (four independent replicates each). Each glass vessel was filled with 210 g of air-dried soil and 1680 mL of tap water to reach a soil/water ratio of 1:8, and hermetically sealed with an air-tight lid. The slurry in each MC was continuously stirred to achieve homogeneity. The system is equipped with an automatic-valve gas regulation system which allows automatic control of E H by adding nitrogen to lower E H or oxygen/ synthetic air to increase E H . The values of E H and pH for the MCs were recorded every 10 min via a data logger. We fluctuated the E H values in two redox cycles to study the impact of the directions of systematic changes of E H on the release dynamics of the four elements. At first, after flooding, the redox potential was forced from reducing to oxidizing conditions and thereafter from oxidizing to reducing conditions by flushing with oxygen and nitrogen, respectively (Table S3). The dissolved and colloidal fractions of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl, in addition to the controlling factors (DOC, DAC, Fe, Mn, Cl -, and SO 4 2-), were gained separately.An automated biogeochemical microcosm system (MC) was employed to simulate the flooding of the un-treated soil and biochartreated soil in the laboratory by controlling the redox conditions.

        <p>There is still an ongoing debate of the terms "dissolved" and "colloidal". A number of different definitions for the colloidal and dissolved fractions currently exist (Guo et al., 2007;Löv et al., 2018). For example, Weber et al. (2009) reported that colloids are operationally defined as particles passing the open-pore suction cup (nominal pore size 10-16 µm). Guo et al. (2007) reported that "dissolved fraction" is defined as submicron particles which have a diameter &lt; 0.45 μm and can passes through 0.45 μm filter membrane, while the "Truly Dissolved fraction" is defined as submicron particles which have a diameter &lt; 0.001 μm (1 nm), and includes the hydrated ions and low molecular weight fraction. However, Abgottspon et al. (2015) obtained the dissolved fraction by filtration the solution using 0.02 μm and obtained colloidal + dissolved fraction by filtration the solution using &lt; 10 µm filter membrane; then they considered the difference between both as the colloidal fraction (0.02-10 μm). In our study, we followed the operationally defined dissolved fraction as per (Guo et al., 2007) and filtered the soil suspension after centrifugation through 0.45 μm filter to gather the dissolved fraction while we obtained the colloidal + dissolved by and filtered the filtration soil suspension after centrifugation through 8.0 µm filter (Abgottspon et al., 2015). Then, we considered the difference between concentrations in the 8.0 µm-filtered aliquot, and 0.45 µm-filtered aliquot are assumed to be the colloidal fraction (0.45-8.0 µm). In conclusion, we used the operationally defined fractions as follow: the &gt; 0.45 μm filtrate as dissolved; the &lt; 8.0 μm filtrate as colloidal + dissolved; and the 8.0-0.45 µm filtrate as colloidal. Filtration was carried out using a Millipore membrane (Whatman Inc., Maidstone, UK). All process has been done in a glove box (MK3 Anaerobic Work Station, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK). The total incubation period was approximately 16 days (375 h). Details of the used methodology and subsampling are provided in the supporting information (Appendix A). The defined E H windows are listed in Table S3.There is still an ongoing debate of the terms "dissolved" and "colloidal". A number of different definitions for the colloidal and dissolved fractions currently exist (Guo et al., 2007;Löv et al., 2018). For example, Weber et al. (2009) reported that colloids are operationally defined as particles passing the open-pore suction cup (nominal pore size 10-16 µm). Guo et al. (2007) reported that "dissolved fraction" is defined as submicron particles which have a diameter &lt; 0.45 μm and can passes through 0.45 μm filter membrane, while the "Truly Dissolved fraction" is defined as submicron particles which have a diameter &lt; 0.001 μm (1 nm), and includes the hydrated ions and low molecular weight fraction.

        <p>The studied soil contains 77.7% sand and 1.5% clay. The soil is slightly alkaline and contains salts (pH = 7.4; EC = 7.2 dSm -1 ). The soil is poor in total carbonates (1.0%) and total organic carbon (0.38%). SiO 2 phase was dominant (58.7%) (Appendix A in Table S1). Results of XPS, FTIR, and Raman analysis of the biochar are presented in Fig. 1 and basic properties and SEM-EDX analysis are given in the supporting information (Appendix A in Table S2 and Fig. S1). The biochar surface contains functional groups including C = O, carbonyl C; C-OH/C-O, hydroxyl C; C-C/C-H, aliphatic/aromatic C; and sp 2 C with highly aliphatic and aromatic C components (Fig. 1a,c). Signals between 400 and 800 cm -1 were detected (Fig. 1b), which can be related to silicates and/or halogens, as proposed by Trakal et al. (2014) and Liu et al. (2016). The high abundance of H-and O-containing functional groups is evidence for the reactive surface of the biochar. Furthermore, aromatic carbon (C = C) could act as a major electron acceptor in the process of biochar oxidation, which may lead to lower concentrations of basic sites on the biochar surface, (Melo et al., 2019) resulting in new functional groups with Brønsted acid characteristics (El-Naggar et al., 2018). High concentrations of O-containing functional groups on the biochar's surface, such as hydroxyl C (C-O) and carbonyl C (C = O), may lead to an ultimately influencing soil properties upon amendment and the redox-induced mobilization of the studied elements (El-Naggar et al., 2018;Yang et al 2019).The studied soil contains 77.7% sand and 1.5% clay.

Those contents were higher than the world soil average and the international maximum allowable concentrations (Kabata-Pendias, 2011).

        <p>The redox potential of the slurry ranged from -30 mV to + 218 mV in the un-treated soil and from -12 mV to + 333 mV in the biochartreated soil over the entire experimental period (n = 11, 000) (Fig. 2). The pH in the slurry ranged between 6.1 and 8.4 in the un-treated soil and 5.5 and 7.6 in the biochar-treated soil, and decreased under oxic conditions (Fig. 2). An inverse trend between E H and pH has been previously observed in other soils (e.g., (Rinklebe et al., 2016a,b), involving an increase in E H which leads to a decrease in pH and vice versa. Alteration of E H towards reducing conditions, particular in the second redox cycle was accompanied with pH increase, which may possibly due to the consumption of protons required for the reduction of NO 3 -, Mn, and Fe (Rinklebe et al., 2016a,b;Frohne et al., 2011). The biochar-treated soil exhibited a wider range of E H and a lower pH than the un-treated soil, which can be explained by the biochar composition (Fig. 1a,b,c) and redox activity of biochar. Biochar may increase a soil's capacity to accept and/or donate electrons by controlling electron transfer reactions, (Yuan et al., 2017;El-Naggar et al., 2018) thus leading to a wider range of E H in the soil slurry. Awad et al. (2018) reported about this phenomenon, wherein they postulated that biochar accepted and donated electrons from electron transfer mediators and modulated soil redox processes according to the specific characteristics and pyrolysis temperature of the applied biochar. The formation of carboxylic and oxygenated functional groups at the surface of the biochar may contribute to an increase of the retention of cations and elements in the soil slurry (Awad et al., 2018).The redox potential of the slurry ranged from -30 mV to + 218 mV in the un-treated soil and from -12 mV to + 333 mV in the biochartreated soil over the entire experimental period (n = 11, 000) (Fig. 2).

        <p>The decrease in pH of the biochar-treated soil (down to 5.5) may result from the oxidation of the biochar's surface at high E H (+200 to + 300 mV), (Yuan et al., 2017) which would decrease the number of basic sites to the soil slurry and leads to a lower pH (El-Naggar et al., 2018). Also, small organic molecules (after addition of biochar to soil) might be decomposed by soil microorganisms which produce amounts of CO 2 , organic acids and the release of initial ammonia content, what decrease soil pH. Electro-active biochar components may also contribute to the redox properties of humic substances in soils, which may affect soil pH. Our investigations as well as other works (e.g., Yuan et al., 2017;Klüpfel et al., 2014;Joseph et al., 2010;Joseph et al., 2013) highlight the importance of redox process affecting soil properties occurring on the surface and in the vicinity of biochar particles. Mineral matter, labile organic molecules and C functional groups at biochar surfaces may determine the E H of a biochar-treated soil (Joseph et al., 2013). Biochar impacts on soil E H can change over time especially if biochar reacts/interacts with micro-organisms, soil mineral and organic matter (Joseph et al., 2013). It is also possible that as biochar fragment, new redox active surfaces are exposed, thus resulting in a more complex series of redox reactions. Our results imply that the observed wider range of E H and pH in the biochar-treated soil in comparison to the untreated-soil affect the release dynamics of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl (section 3.3). Thallium was more mobile in comparison to Sb, Sn, and Ag, observed to have the highest dissolved and colloidal concentrations among the four elements, while Ag showed the lowest (Fig. 2; Table 1). Thallium is known to be weakly bound to soil components (Jacobson et al., 2005;Vaněk et al., 2016). Increasing Tl mobilization in the studied soil may increase its concentrations in the ground water and also increase its uptake by plants, which consider as a major environmental issue and threat to human and the ecosystem health, because the human exposure to Tl is mainly associated with the consumption of contaminated food or drinking water.The decrease in pH of the biochar-treated soil (down to 5.5) may result from the oxidation of the biochar's surface at high E H (+200 to + 300 mV), (Yuan et al., 2017) which would decrease the number of basic sites to the soil slurry and leads to a lower pH (El-Naggar et al., 2018).

        <p>On the contrary, Sb is relatively more immobile than Tl in the natural environment due to its precipitation with alkali metal(loid)s which results in the formation of stable mineral phases, such as calcium antimonates (Herath et al., 2017).

        <p>Silver was more abundant in the colloidal fraction than in the dissolved fraction at all studied E H values during the entire experimental period in both the biochar-treated and un-treated soil (Fig. 2), which indicate that Ag might be associated with soil colloids under different redox cycles. We assume that Ag may have high affinity to soil colloids (such as clay, Fe oxides, and organic materials). Silver has been shown to be relatively immobile in soils and tends to be retained by soil compounds such as clay, Fe oxides, and organic materials under a wide range of soil pH (Jacobson et al., 2005;Sikora and Stevenson, 1988). Exchange reactions are purported to play an important role in Ag + sorption to soils. Among soil colloids, organic colloids content could be a dominant factor in Ag sorption in soils. This behavior is consistent with the reportedly strong complexation of Ag by humic and fulvic acids, and by soil organic matter, especially thiol groups (Jacobson et al., 2005).Silver was more abundant in the colloidal fraction than in the dissolved fraction at all studied E H values during the entire experimental period in both the biochar-treated and un-treated soil (Fig. 2), which indicate that Ag might be associated with soil colloids under different redox cycles.

        <p>On the other hand, Sb, Sn, and Tl revealed a similar behavior and were more abundant in the colloidal fraction than in the dissolved fraction in the first redox cycle (decreasing E H from the initial (+200 mV) to -30 mV; then increasing E H from -30 mV to + 333 mV). However, in the second redox cycle (decreasing E H from + 333 mV to 0 mV), the three elements were more abundant in the dissolved fraction than in the colloidal fraction in both the untreated soil and the biochar-treated soil (Fig. 2). This result indicates that Sb, Sn, and Tl are retained by colloids under oxic acidic conditions in the first redox cycle (in particular in the biochar-treated soil) and released to soil solution in the second redox cycle under moderately reducing and alkaline conditions (Fig. 2). These results indicate that colloids might play an important role in Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl mobilization in the studied soil, as will be discussed in section 3.3.2.4.On the other hand, Sb, Sn, and Tl revealed a similar behavior and were more abundant in the colloidal fraction than in the dissolved fraction in the first redox cycle (decreasing E H from the initial (+200 mV) to -30 mV; then increasing E H from -30 mV to + 333 mV).

        <p>Biochar application to the soil leads to a relative increase of the release of dissolved Sb, Sn, and Tl, and to a relative decrease of the colloidal concentrations in comparison to the un-treated soil (Table 1; Fig. 2). The wider range of E H (-12 to + 333) and pH (5.0-8.1) in the biochar treated soil than the un-treated soil (E H = -30 to + 218; pH = 5.9-8.6) might be a potential factor in increasing the solubility of the elements in the biochar treated soil in comparison to the un-treated soil. Redox properties of the biochar and the related processes may impact the mobilization of Sb, Sn, and Tl in the biochar-treated soil. In particular, functional groups in biochar contribute to its redox characteristics, where these groups may act as both electron donor and acceptor, reducing and oxidizing the elements, which affect the elements reduction and oxidation in the flooded soil (Yuan et al., 2017;Dong et al., 2014). For example, semiquinone radicals in the biochar might be involved in the metal(loi)d oxidation, while the carboxylic groups in the biochar may participate in both reduction and oxidation of the elements (Yuan et al., 2017;Xu et al., 2019;Shaheen et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2010). The spectroscopic characterization of the studied biochar (Fig. 1) indicated high abundance of H, C, and O-containing functional groups. While the functional groups such as phenolic species in biochar are the main electron donating moieties (i.e., reducers), the quinones and polycondensed aromatic functional groups are the components accepting electrons (oxidants). Therefore, we assume that the used biochar might be rich in π-electrons due to the abundance of surface functional groups and these groups may act as electron donors for the Sb, Sn, and Tl reduction reactions, and thus biochar may play an important role in reducing Tl 3+ to Tl + , Sb 5+ to Sb 3+ , and Sn 4+ to Sn 2+ , which increase their solubility under reducing conditions as compared to oxic conditions (Fig. 2).Biochar application to the soil leads to a relative increase of the release of dissolved Sb, Sn, and Tl, and to a relative decrease of the colloidal concentrations in comparison to the un-treated soil (Table 1; Fig. 2). The wider range of E H (-12 to + 333) and pH (5.0-8.1) in the biochar treated soil than the un-treated soil (E H = -30 to + 218; pH = 5.9-8.6) might be a potential factor in increasing the solubility of the elements in the biochar treated soil in comparison to the un-treated soil.

In particular, functional groups in biochar contribute to its redox characteristics, where these groups may act as both electron donor and acceptor, reducing and oxidizing the elements, which affect the elements reduction and oxidation in the flooded soil (Yuan et al., 2017;Dong et al., 2014).

Therefore, we assume that the used biochar might be rich in π-electrons due to the abundance of surface functional groups and these groups may act as electron donors for the Sb, Sn, and Tl reduction reactions, and thus biochar may play an important role in reducing Tl 3+ to Tl + , Sb 5+ to Sb 3+ , and Sn 4+ to Sn 2+ , which increase their solubility under reducing conditions as compared to oxic conditions (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>On other the hand, biochar application to the soil decreased the concentrations of Ag in the dissolved and colloidal fraction especially at the end of the experiment under low E H and high pH (Fig. 2). The dissolved concentrations of Ag decreased from 1.38 to 8.36 µg L -1 in the un-treated soil to 0.79-5.58 µg L -1 in the biochar treated soil (Table 1). This could be due to the increase of soil organic carbon in the biochar treated soil and the related sorption of Ag to the organic matter. Biochar has the ability to adsorb Ag by a combination two consecutive mechanisms, reduction and physical adsorption as reported by Antunes et al. (2017). In this respect, Abbas et al. (2019) found that biochar immobilized Ag in paddy soil and thus can be used effectively to prevent its uptake in rice.On other the hand, biochar application to the soil decreased the concentrations of Ag in the dissolved and colloidal fraction especially at the end of the experiment under low E H and high pH (Fig. 2). The dissolved concentrations of Ag decreased from 1.38 to 8.36 µg L -1 in the un-treated soil to 0.79-5.58 µg L -1 in the biochar treated soil (Table 1).

        <p>These results indicate that the studied biochar might be used for immobilization of Ag and decreasing its plant uptake in the studied soil. However, for the used biochar leads to an increasing mobilization of Sb, Sn, and Tl, which would increase their uptake and movement to the ground water and therefore increase their potential risk in the studied ecosystem. On other side, increasing the dissolved concentration of Sb, Sn, and Tl by biochar might be used for enhancing their phytoextraction using nonedible plants and shorten the requested time for phyto-management of the studied soil.These results indicate that the studied biochar might be used for immobilization of Ag and decreasing its plant uptake in the studied soil.

        <p>The differing redox-behaviors of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in the un-treated and biochar-treated soil can be explained by the changes of E H as well as the linked E H -dependent changes of pH, Fe, Mn (hydr)oxides, S, Cl -, DOC, and DAC. We conducted factor analysis to determine the associations between the concentrations of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl and controlling factors (E H , pH, DOC, SUVA, Fe, Mn, S, and Cl -) in the dissolved Table 1 Variations of concentrations of elements and carriers in the dissolved and colloidal fractions as well as pH and redox potential (E H ) in suspensions of the non-treated soil and the biochar-treated soil (number of analyzed sample s are 28 in soil and 32 in soil + biochar).

        <p>The impact of pH on Ag solubility was non-significant in both soils and thus they were separated from each other in the factor analysis (Fig. 3a,b). We assume that increasing Tl solubility under reducing alkaline conditions might be due to the existence of Tl in the form of the soluble thallous cation Tl + . The Tl + ion is the dominant species in many E H -pH combinations (Takeno, 2005). In this respect, Casiot et al. (2011) indicated that Tl + is relatively soluble, and it tends to dominate over Tl 3+ in aquatic environments, due to the high redox potential of Tl 3+ / Tl + couple (E H = 1.28 V). The dominance of Tl + in soil solution is reported by Xiong (2007) and Jia et al. (2018) who found that Tl in the solution of rhizosphere mainly exists as Tl + . Jia et al. (2018) also reported that Tl 3+ can be reduced to Tl + in soils even at the surface where the chemical environment promotes oxidation. Tl 3+ is less stable and can undergo rapid electrochemical reduction to Tl + (logK ≅ 40, E red (Tl 3+ / Tl + )=+1.26 V (Biaduń et al., 2016).The impact of pH on Ag solubility was non-significant in both soils and thus they were separated from each other in the factor analysis (Fig. 3a,b).

        <p>Also, we assume that the interactions between Tl and potassium (K) in our soil (K 2 O = 1.8%; Table S1) may also affect the release and mobilization of Tl. For example, in the reduced state, Tl + has the same charge as and is comparable in size to K + , with ionic radii of 1.76 Å for Tl + and 1.60 Å for K + . This allows Tl + to substitute for similar-sized alkali element K + in soil minerals (Jacobson et al., 2005;Rader et al., 2019). The high solubility of Tl in our soil may pose human health and ecosystem risks because Tl is a highly toxic element to humans and mammals and also inhibits the growth of many plants and aquatic organisms (Rader et al., 2019).Also, we assume that the interactions between Tl and potassium (K) in our soil (K 2 O = 1.8%; Table S1) may also affect the release and mobilization of Tl.

        <p>The relatively higher concentration of dissolved Sb under moderately reducing (E H = +100 to -33 mV) and alkaline (pH = 8.1-8.6) conditions might be due to the presence of Sb 3+ and/or Sb 5+ . Findings by Hockmann et al. (2014) indicate that Sb 3+ is predominant at low redox conditions (Eh &lt; 50 mV) in the solid and liquid phase, while Sb 5+ is less stable in reducing environments.

        <p>Similar to Tl and Sb, Sn in the colloidal and dissolved fraction was found to be mobilized under wide ranges of E H and pH (Fig. 2). However, in the second redox cycle, Sn was abundant in the dissolved fraction under low E H . Tin in soil solution might be found in two oxidative states, stannous (Sn (+2)) and stannic (Sn (+4)). Generally, the mobility of Sn is highly E H /pH dependent; especially, Sn (+2), a strong reducing agent, can be present mainly in acid and reducing environments (Kabata-Pendias, 2011). In addition, an enhanced solubility of Sb and Sn under low E H might be also due to an increased degree of methylation under low E H as indicated by Frohne et al.

        <p>The relative increase of Tl, Sb, and Sn solubility in the biochartreated soil might be caused by functional groups such as phenolic species in biochar which may act as electron donor, and play an important role in reducing Tl 3+ to Tl + , Sb 5+ to Sb 3+ , and Sn 4+ to Sn 2+ , which increase their solubility under reducing conditions. These abovementioned results failed to identify simple and clear distinct patterns of the four elements in response to fluctuations of E H . This may imply that the redox-induced release of the four elements might be controlled indirectly via the E H -dependent changes in pH and the chemistry of Fe, Mn, S, and DOC as discussed in the following sections.The relative increase of Tl, Sb, and Sn solubility in the biochartreated soil might be caused by functional groups such as phenolic species in biochar which may act as electron donor, and play an important role in reducing Tl 3+ to Tl + , Sb 5+ to Sb 3+ , and Sn 4+ to Sn 2+ , which increase their solubility under reducing conditions.

The dissolved OC (DOC) increased under low E H in the first redox cycle (Appendix A in Fig. S2). The higher DOC at reducing than at oxidizing conditions in the first redox cycle might be due to release of organic matter bound to reductively dissolved Fe-and Mn-hydroxides and/or the release of OC from soluble organic metabolites produced by reducing bacteria under reductive conditions (Frohne et al., 2014). During the second reducing cycle (+100 and 0 mV) the addition of biochar leads to higher values of organic carbon in the dissolved fraction as compared to the un-treated soil (Appendix A in Fig. S2).

        <p>The higher SUVA under oxic/alkaline conditions indicates that the proportion of aromatic DOC to aliphatic DOC in the studied soil was higher at high E H and pH than at low E H and pH. These results show that aromatic carbon compounds were more resistant and increased under oxidizing conditions, while low molecular weight and labile organic carbon was more easily decomposed under reducing conditions. We assume that desorption of OM sorbed onto soil minerals due to pH change during reduction-oxidation cycles explains the behavior of SUVA in our soil. The protonated hydroxyl groups at low E H and pH in the tested soil can generate a positive charge on the mineral surfaces, which induces sorption of negatively charged (less aromatic) organic molecules and promotes their surface complex formation.

        <p>The SUVA clustered with dissolved Sb, Sn, and Tl in one group, while the DOC was separated from this group in both soils (Fig. 3a,b). An opposite behavior between SUVA and DOC was also observed in the significant positive relations between SUVA and Sb, Sn, and Tl on one hand and the negative relations between these three elements and DOC on the other hand (Appendix A in Table S4). We hypothesize that aromatic organic compounds are more important than aliphatic organic compounds for governing the release of Sb, Sn, and Tl in the soil. Our used biochar surface contains functional groups includes aliphatic/ aromatic C; and sp 2 C with highly aliphatic and aromatic C components (Fig. 1), which support our hypothesis. We infer that Sb, Sn, and Tl may form complexes with aromatic organic compounds which are more soluble than their complexes with aliphatic organic compounds. The affinity of some trace elements for DOC might be stronger in solutions containing a greater content of humic and aromatic structures. The ability of such elements to complex with DOC could result in increased mobilization of these elements in the soil environment (Settimio et al., 2014).

        <p>3.3.2.3. Fe/Mn. The higher concentrations of colloidal Fe than dissolved Fe in both the un-treated soil and in the biochar-treated soil (Table 1) indicate that Fe might be relatively more associated with colloids. In contrast, Mn was more abundant in the dissolved than the colloidal fraction (Table 1), in particular under oxic conditions (Appendix A in Fig. S2), which might be explained by the associated decrease of pH as indicated by Takeno (2005) and explained by Shaheen et al. (2014). The dissolved concentrations of Sb, Sn, and Tl were associated with Fe in the un-treated soil, and with Mn in the biochar-treated soil, while Ag was associated with neither Fe nor Mn in both soils (Fig. 3a,b). The association revealed by factor analysis between dissolved concentrations of Sb, Sn, and Tl and dissolved Fe in the un-treated soil, and with Mn in the biochar-treated soil, can be explained by the reductive dissolution of Fe-Mn(hydro)oxides under low E H and release of the associated Sb, Sn, and Tl to soil solution in the dissolved form. These findings are consistent with a stronger impact of Fe redox chemistry on elemental solubility in the un-treated soil than in the biochar-treated soil. On the other hand, the impact of Mn redox chemistry on the dissolved elements seems higher in the biochartreated soil than the untreated soil, which may be due to the higher redox sensitivity of Mn oxides and the wider range of E H and a lower pH in the biochar-treated than in the un-treated soil. The reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides does not occur simultaneously, where Mn oxides reduce before Fe; this may explain that Mn is relatively more abundant in the dissolved phase compared to Fe, and this may explain that Sb, Sn, and Tl associate with Fe in the un-treated soil but with Mn in the biochar-treated soil.3.3.2.3.

        <p>The interaction between Sb and Fe is in agreement with those reported by Hockmann et al. (2014), Wan et al. (2013), andHan et al. (2018) who found that previously sorbed Sb 3+ can be gradually released to the soil solution due to reductive dissolution of iron (hydr) oxides under reducing conditions. The positive relations between Sn and Fe were in agreement with Kabata-Pendias (2011) who reported that the mobility of Sn in soils is rather similar to that of Fe. The interaction of Tl with Fe and Mn would then be due to the sorption of Tl to Fe 3+ -colloids (Griffiths, 1992).

        <p>3.3.2.4. Sulfur and chloride. Concentration of SO 4 2-in the dissolved fraction of the biochar-treated soil was lower than in the un-treated soil (Table 1), indicating that the biochar might have prevented the release of SO 4 2-into soil solution. Under the first redox cycle, the concentrations of SO 4 2-under oxic conditions were higher than under reducing conditions (Appendix A in Fig. S2); This is most likely because sulfides were formed under reducing conditions and oxidized to SO 4 2under oxic conditions (Takeno, 2005). Concentrations of Cl -reveal very small fluctuations during the experiment and were relatively similar between the un-treated soil and the biochar-treated soil (Appendix A in Fig. S2), with mean values of 1055 and 1058 mg L -1 , respectively (Table 1), which indicates that the biochar application to soil was not able to retain Cl -and thus, a release of dissolved Cl -from the soil solids into soil solution was detected. Concentrations of Sb, Sn, and Tl in the dissolved fraction were grouped together with sulfur in the un-treated and the biochar-treated soil (Fig. 3a,b).

        <p>These results indicate that the redox chemistry of sulfur may greatly affect the redox-induced release dynamics of Sb, Sn, and Tl and in particular Tl in our soils. In the biochar-treated soil, Cl -was clustered with the Sb, Sn, and Tl (Fig. 3b) while SO 4 2-forms a separate cluster, which could be interpreted as an indication that the elements might form complexes with Cl -ions in our salt-affected soil. We may conclude that Tl(+1) may be able to form relatively strong complexes with Cl - and weaker complexes with SO 4 2-, as also reported by Evans and Barabash. (2010). Under reducing conditions, thallium sulfide, Tl 2 S(s), might be formed, which is relatively soluble compared to other metallic sulfides (Evans and Barabash., 2010). We also found that the sulfide fraction of Tl is dominant in both the soil and biochar-treated soil (data not shown). The importance of sulfides and chloride on the leachability of Tl is reported by others (e.g., Antić-Mladenović et al., 2017;Karbowska et al., 2014).These results indicate that the redox chemistry of sulfur may greatly affect the redox-induced release dynamics of Sb, Sn, and Tl and in particular Tl in our soils. In the biochar-treated soil, Cl -was clustered with the Sb, Sn, and Tl (Fig. 3b) while SO 4 2-forms a separate cluster, which could be interpreted as an indication that the elements might form complexes with Cl -ions in our salt-affected soil. We may conclude that Tl(+1) may be able to form relatively strong complexes with Cl - and weaker complexes with SO 4 2-, as also reported by Evans and Barabash. (2010).

        <p>The association between the dissolved Sn and sulfur in the solution of both soils (Fig. 3a,b) could be due to a variety of Sn sulfide minerals which may exist in our soil, such as stannite (Cu 2 SnFeS 4 ) and montesite (PbSn 4 S 5 ) as mentioned by Kabata-Pendias (2011) The dominance of the sulfide fraction of Sn in our soil might support the association between Sn and S (data not shown). The impact of sulfide on the release of Sb in our soils can be explained by the ability of dissolved sulfide to reduce Sb(OH) 6-under a variety of environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions (Polack et al., 2009). In this respect, Han et al. (2018) also found that the dominant reaction process of Sb under anoxic conditions was its precipitation as sulfide minerals.The association between the dissolved Sn and sulfur in the solution of both soils (Fig. 3a,b) could be due to a variety of Sn sulfide minerals which may exist in our soil, such as stannite (Cu 2 SnFeS 4 ) and montesite (PbSn 4 S 5 ) as mentioned by Kabata-Pendias (2011) The dominance of the sulfide fraction of Sn in our soil might support the association between Sn and S (data not shown).

        <p>We assume that sulfur and chloride are important factors govern the release of Ag in our soil. Silver was separated in the factor analysis from the E H , pH and the other studied factors and did not correlate with these factors (Appendix A in Table S4); however, it was more closely associated to S, Cl -, and SO 4 2-in the un-treated soil (Fig. 3a). This might be due to the ability of Ag to form strong sulfide complexes (Adams and Kramer, 1998;Hashimoto et al., 2017). In addition, Ag(+1) may sorb onto and into colloidal or particulate sulfides and form Ag 2 S(s) (Bell and Kramer., 1999). Moreover, Ag ions may be adsorbed rapidly onto amorphous FeS (Evans and Barabash, 2010). Silver also might be precipitated as AgCl(s) under oxidizing conditions and Ag 2 S(s) under reducing environments. Hashimoto et al. (2017) found that 83% of the spiked Ag in soils was transformed into Ag 2 S under reducing conditions. The formation of the precipitate depends on the relative amount of chloride and sulfide in the soil-slurry-system. The XANES results of Settimio et al. (2014) (Takeno, 2005). The Ag 2 S is stable and does not dissolve even after prolonged aeration (Auvinen et al., 2017). We assume that under the high salinity and high content of total sulfur (2877 mg kg -1 ) in our soil, Ag(+1) may form precipitates with Cl - under oxic conditions and participates perhaps as Ag 2 S(s) as suggested by Evans and Barabash. (2010) Thus, these are likely mechanisms for the low degree of Ag solubility and its higher abundance in the colloidal than in the dissolved fraction under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2).We assume that sulfur and chloride are important factors govern the release of Ag in our soil.

        <p>3.3.2.5. Redox mediated interactions between soil colloids and release of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl. Colloids comprised of silicate minerals, amorphous Fe-oxyhydroxides, organic materials and sulfides/sulfates are important sorbents of pollutants in soils. Collide-metal formation and compositions are strongly affected by redox fluctuation as the change of Fe redox chemistry, pH, ionic strength, and organic matter (Yan et al., 2016). As mentioned above and indicated in Fig. 1, Ag was more abundant in the colloidal fraction than in the dissolved fraction at all E H windows in both the biochar-treated and un-treated soil. Also, Sb, Sn, and Tl were more abundant in the colloidal fraction than in the dissolved fraction under wide range of E H and pH, particularly in the first redox cycle (Fig. 1). In addition, Fe concentrations were higher in the colloidal fraction than that of the dissolved fraction in both the untreated soil and in the biochar-treated soil (Table 1). However, DOC concentrations were higher in the dissolved than in the colloidal fraction (Table 1). Therefore, we assume that the Fe oxyhydroxides and dissolved organic matter (DOM) are the most important colloids can govern the redox-induced release of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in the studied biochar treated and untreated soil. In redox-dynamic soils, colloids mobility is largely controlled by Fe 3+ dissolution, shifts in pH, and interactions with DOM (Yan et al., 2016). For example, some studies (e.g, Ryan and Gschwend, 1994;Thompson et al., 2006) reported that dispersion of colloids in soils under aerobic/anaerobic conditions has been linked to Fe dissolution and an increase in the suspension pH. Fe oxides can act as cementing agents, binding colloids together or to the soil matrix, and colloids may be released after the dissolution of these oxides. In our soil, Fe dissolution under anaerobic conditions coincided with the initial high level of DOC may lead to subsequent colloid aggregation due to bridging (Yan et al., 2016). However, the high concentrations of DOC released under anaerobic conditions may decrease the colloids release due to DOC-colloid association. This complexity might be explained by the coupling effects of DOM through direct contacts with colloids or indirect influence on microbial Fe reduction via electron shuttling and Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexation (Royer et al., 2002). Baalousha (2009) showed that DOM could both disintegrate soil aggregates into colloids and destabilize (i.e., cause formation of aggregates) suspended colloids depending on the DOM concentration or composition. The dominance of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl together with Fe in the colloidal fraction under wide range of E H and pH in the untreated and biochar-treated soil indicate that the Fe oxides colloidal particles were able to scavenge Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl (e.g., by sorption) from soil solution, and this might be responsible for decreasing the dissolved concentrations of these elements and increasing their concentration in the colloidal fraction.3.3.2.5.

        <p>Increasing the concentrations of Sb, Sn, and Tl in the colloidal fraction under oxic conditions might be explained by the association of these elements with the precipitated Fe oxides and/or with the aromatic compounds of DOC as indicated by the increase of colloidal Fe and SUVA under high E H , which may support our previous hypothesis. These findings have implications for colloid release and colloidassociated mobilization and transport of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl in redoxdynamic environments.Increasing the concentrations of Sb, Sn, and Tl in the colloidal fraction under oxic conditions might be explained by the association of these elements with the precipitated Fe oxides and/or with the aromatic compounds of DOC as indicated by the increase of colloidal Fe and SUVA under high E H , which may support our previous hypothesis.

        <p>Thallium and Sb exhibit higher potential mobility than Sn and Ag (Fig. 4). The potential mobility of the four elements, particularly Sb, Sn, and Tl increased with increasing E H from 0 mV to + 200 mV in the untreated soil and from 0 mV to + 300 mV in the biochar-treated soil in the first redox cycle. Thereafter, the potential mobility decreases along with decreasing of E H to 0 mV in the second redox cycle (Fig. 4). The highest potential mobility of Sb, Sn, and Tl in the untreated soil and biochar treated soil was observed at high E H (+300 mv) and low pH (pH = 5.7), and the lowest at low E H (0 mv) and high pH (7.2) in the second redox cycle (Fig. 4). These findings mean that the potential mobility of the elements varied under the wider range of E H and pH in the untreated soil and biochar-treated soil; however, the variations were wider in the biochar-treated soil than the untreated soil. The higher E H and the associated lower pH increased the potential mobility of the elements in the soil as compared to the moderate reducing alkaline conditions.Thallium and Sb exhibit higher potential mobility than Sn and Ag (Fig. 4).

        <p>Biochar addition leads to a higher potential mobility (Fig. 4) of Sb, Sn, and Tl under oxic redox conditions (+200 and + 300 mV) as compared to the un-treated soil, likely due to the decreased soil pH caused by a higher E H . Those results demonstrate that redox cycles profoundly affect the potential mobility of the studied elements as a result of the E H -dependent changes of soil pH. We assume that the wider range of E H and pH in the biochar-treated soil than the untreated soil might be a reasonable factor for the higher potential mobility of the elements in the biochar-treated than the untreated soil. Additionally, an enhancement of the total and dissolved organic carbon in the biochartreated soil in comparison to the untreated soil may contribute to the increase in potential mobility of the elements in the biochar-treated soil at oxic acidic conditions.Biochar addition leads to a higher potential mobility (Fig. 4) of Sb, Sn, and Tl under oxic redox conditions (+200 and + 300 mV) as compared to the un-treated soil, likely due to the decreased soil pH caused by a higher E H .

        <p>This study demonstrates the high potential of the used automated biogeochemical microcosm system as a powerful tool for understanding the redox-induced mobilization of emerging contaminants in soils, and the utility of such information in environmental and health-related planning and in management of PTEs contaminated wetland soils. We found that the dissolved concentrations and potential mobility of Sb, Sn, and Tl increased in the biochar treated soil, in particular in the second redox cycle. This can increase their release and transfer into the groundwater and the food chain, which could cause negative effects on human and environmental health. The redox activity of biochars in soils could be a function of the changes in pH and Fe chemistry and thus the metals mobilization.This study demonstrates the high potential of the used automated biogeochemical microcosm system as a powerful tool for understanding the redox-induced mobilization of emerging contaminants in soils, and the utility of such information in environmental and health-related planning and in management of PTEs contaminated wetland soils.

        <p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that a release of Sb, Sn, and/or Tl in rice husk biochar treated mining soils should be considered due to an increased mobilization and the associated environmental risks when using those soils for flooded agricultural systems, such as in rice paddy soils and/or fish-culture systems. Also, our results might be useful for a proper management of Ag, Sb, Sn, and/or Tl contaminated wetland soils. For example, our results indicate that the rice hull biochar might be used for the immobilization of Ag and decreasing its plant uptake in the studied soil, while it might be used for enhancing the phytoextraction of Sb, Sn, and Tl. In addition, based on our results, we may suggest using organic materials rich in aliphatic compounds for immobilization of Sb, Sn, and Tl in flooded soils.In conclusion, our findings suggest that a release of Sb, Sn, and/or Tl in rice husk biochar treated mining soils should be considered due to an increased mobilization and the associated environmental risks when using those soils for flooded agricultural systems, such as in rice paddy soils and/or fish-culture systems.

        <p>Our results provide new insights into biogeochemical processes that control the release dynamics and distribution of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl among the dissolved and colloidal fractions of soil solution, as well as the potential mobility of these metal(loi)ds in the solid phase. Further understanding of these processes provides the basic knowledge, so far lacking, to understand, to predict, to control and to remediate Ag, Sb, Sn, and/or Tl polluted flooded soil ecosystems. Speciation of the elements in the soil solution and solid-phase of further soils treated with various types of biochars under dynamic redox conditions is needed in future to gain a deeper understanding of biogeochemical mechanisms controlling the redox-induced release kinetics of these elements and their interactions with biochars.Our results provide new insights into biogeochemical processes that control the release dynamics and distribution of Ag, Sb, Sn, and Tl among the dissolved and colloidal fractions of soil solution, as well as the potential mobility of these metal(loi)ds in the solid phase.
