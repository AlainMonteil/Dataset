        <p>Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change. However, previous data limitations have prevented a robust evaluation of the global rates and mechanisms driving C accumulation. Here, we go beyond recent soil C stock estimates to reveal global tidal wetland C accumulation and predict changes under relative sea-level rise, temperature and precipitation. We use data from literature study sites and our new observations spanning wide latitudinal gradients and 20 countries. Globally, tidal wetlands accumulate 53.65 (95%CI: 48.52-59.01) Tg C yr -1 , which is ~30% of the organic C buried on the ocean floor. Modelling based on current climatic drivers and under projected emissions scenarios revealed a net increase in the global C accumulation by 2100. This rapid increase is driven by sea-level rise in tidal marshes, and higher temperature and precipitation in mangroves. Countries with large areas of coastal wetlands, like Indonesia and Mexico, are more susceptible to tidal wetland C losses under climate change, while regions such as Australia, Brazil, the USA and China will experience a significant C accumulation increase under all projected scenarios.Coastal tidal wetlands produce and accumulate significant amounts of organic carbon (C) that help to mitigate climate change.

        <p>Feedbacks between vegetation and soil accretion help mangroves and tidal marshes to remain within the intertidal zone in the face of sea-level rise [3,4] through the accumulation of mineral and organic sediments [10] space (i.e. the inland space available for sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation) [3,11]. However, human activities are imposing many pressures on tidal wetlands, including climate change-induced accelerated sealevel rise, subsidence through groundwater as well as the extraction of other substances, and the reduction of sediment supply from the construction of systems that reduce sediment flow such as damns. Furthermore, a lack of accommodation space, which is the space made available for organic and inorganic material to deposit, in relation to an increase in relative sea level rise rate (RSLR) may limit the sediment accumulation rates in specific tidal wetlands [11,12]. As a result, there is growing concern that a lack of space for inland migration brought about through land use change or steep landward slopes may prevent mangrove and tidal marsh wetland adaptation to fast rates of sea-level rise [13,14].Feedbacks between vegetation and soil accretion help mangroves and tidal marshes to remain within the intertidal zone in the face of sea-level rise [3,4] through the accumulation of mineral and organic sediments [10] space (i.e. the inland space available for sediments to accumulate and be colonized by wetland vegetation) [3,11].

        <p>Blue Carbon accumulation in tidal wetlands is potentially driven by climatic factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and evapotranspiration) [15][16][17], coastal oceanographic processes (e.g., tidal amplitude, currents and geomorphology) [13,14] and nutrient availability [18]. Identifying the controlling factors of C accumulation dynamics is critical for understanding the fate of the C buried by these wetlands under future climate change scenarios on global and regional scales. If climate change alters the fundamental drivers of organic C accumulation, the amount of sequestered C may also be modified and provide a different feedback to global warming.Blue Carbon accumulation in tidal wetlands is potentially driven by climatic factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall, and evapotranspiration) [15][16][17], coastal oceanographic processes (e.g., tidal amplitude, currents and geomorphology) [13,14] and nutrient availability [18].

        <p>Here, we estimate global tidal wetlands Blue C accumulation rates in different regions and countries. We rely on literature (n=564) data supplemented by new (n=49) soil core data from previously unaccounted areas in Indonesia, tropical South America and Africa (Fig. 1). Soil cores were dated with the radiometric geochronologies ( 137 Cs, 239+240 Pu and 210 Pb) or Sediment Elevation Table (SET) methods covering time scales of sub-decade to decades. Both methods account for surface and subsurface processes, including organic and mineral sedimentation, sediment compaction and organic matter decomposition [19,20], and are widely used for sediment and carbon accretion rate measurements [21]. We first evaluate the spatial patterns and drivers of global soil accretion and C accumulation building on recent work focusing on carbon stocks [22,23]. We then predict C accumulation rates (CAR) in global tidal wetlands under differing emission scenarios based on CMIP5 projections. We further combine projected CAR with a future global tidal wetland area change dataset [11] to develop the first projections of how global tidal wetland carbon accumulation will change in response to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. This approach focuses on a centennial time scale of anthropogenic climate change and prevents bias from other methods operating at different time scales [24].

        <p>Tidal wetland C accumulation rates in the Northern and Southern hemispheres were not significantly different (p&lt;0.05). However, pooling the data into broad latitudinal bands revealed that tropical mangroves between 0 and 10 had the highest C accumulation per unit area (428± 7 g C m -2 yr -1 for Northern hemisphere and 384± 11 g C m -2 yr -1 for Southern hemisphere) and temperate tidal marshes between 30 and 40 had the lowest (144 ± 6 g C m -2 yr -1 for Northern hemisphere and 88.7± 3.5 g C m -2 yr -1 for Southern hemisphere) (Fig. 1).

        <p>A variety of environmental factors can drive wetland soil carbon sequestration [15][16][17]. We collected climatic and environmental factors for each site, including mean annual temperature (MAT), annual precipitation (MAP), tidal range, elevation, RSLR, total suspended matters (TSM), and tropical cyclone frequency, to attempt in discovery the principal environmental factors that drive soil C accumulation in tidal marshes and mangrove forests (See details in M&amp;M section). Our study contains a robust dataset to assess the main drivers of CAR on global and local scale. We developed linear mixed-effect models (see M&amp;M section and Table S1) that provides results for the detected main environmental factors on CAR (Table S2) as standardized coefficients (Fig. S1). These coefficients indicate the proportional change in CAR in response to one SD change in an environmental factor.

Similarly, there were some mangroves sites that reported the relative location, we thus separated these sites into high and low tidal sites with apparent elevation difference. However, we also did not observe any significant difference between these tidal areas (Fig S7). As most of our compiled studies did not report site elevations, we further extracted the elevation data for each site from CoastalDEM database, which is a digital terrain model providing bare earth elevations for coastal areas with 90 m horizontal resolution [39].

The coastal wetland area changes under corresponding scenarios were extracted from a recent integrated global model developed by Schuerch, Spencer [11].

We thus suggest that even with a decrease in wetland area, the total C accumulation in tidal wetlands will keep increasing until the end of the 21 st century due to increased temperature and precipitation in mangroves, and higher RSLR in tidal marshes. Our temperatures, our modeling implies that the soil organic C accumulation and wetland extent will be more resilient to sea-level rise by 2100 than previously suggested [3,11].We estimate that global tidal wetland C accumulation (Figure 3) will increase by at least 35%, i.e. from 53.65 to 67.5 Tg yr -1 (95%CI: 60-83.7 Tg yr -1 ) in 2100 under the high-emissions RCP8.5 scenario (Table 1), even though the total area will decrease by 30% as a result of highly limited accommodation space [11].

        <p>Most of the C that accumulated in the tidal wetland sediments is derived from autochthonous organic matter, particularly root material [48,49].

Although the model we used for future tidal wetland area is contested among researchers [11,38,57], the results of our global projection mainly rely on the increasing CAR under future climate change factors. For example, the global C sequestration is projected to increase by at least 35% towards the final decade of this century (Figure 3) even though the total area of tidal wetlands will decrease by 30% as predicted by Schuerch, Spencer [11]. Moreover, the patterns of CAR in response to climate change that we observed in this study are in line with a previous modeling stimulation of salt marsh C accumulation in response to climate change [15]. We thus believe that our study captures the actual CAR responses to altered RSLR, precipitation and temperature, which may benefit future process-based models. global tidal wetlands only occupy &lt;0.1% of the global area, they could offset at least 0.5% of the current anthropogenic CO 2 emission rates, a spatial efficiency that is 15 times higher than terrestrial and 50 times higher than the open ocean per unit area [46]. Therefore, our results demonstrate that preserving and rehabilitating mangroves and salt marshes will remain an effective approach to tackle global climate change with significant regional benefits in tidal wetland-rich countries.For instance, mudflats near tidal wetlands may have comparable sediment C accumulation rates for which tidal vegetated wetlands are often a major source of organic matter [2,52].

        <p>We compiled data on sediment accretion rates (SAR) measured in tidal marshes and mangroves worldwide, using 137 Cs, 239+240 Pu, 210 Pb geochronologies or SET methods to generate the most robust dataset on tidal wetland carbon sequestration rates to date.

To be included in our dataset, studies had to cover the temporal scale of sub-decade to decades, which are compatible with anthropogenic climate change and future CMIP5 projections. Data were extracted until September 2018 from published studies or obtained via personal communication. We compiled a total of 102 studies with 564 reported sites that matched our criteria (Table S2).

        <p>Some studies have directly reported the carbon accumulation rates (CAR), which was calculated by SAR multiplying the soil C density. The vertical SAR represented average soil accretion rates from sub-decade to decades depending on the different dating methods. The 137 Cs, 239+240 Pu and 210 Pb dating methods, and the Sediment Elevation Table (SET) methods were employed in this study to determine average rates of vertical sediment accretion [61,62]. Where reports made available both SAR and C density, the CAR was calculated in this study. Some studies have reported the SAR and C density or C content for multiple layers, reflecting their changes over time. For these studies, we averaged their C density and SAR over up to 30 cm soils which recorded the most recent C accumulation (less than 100 yrs for most sites).Some studies have directly reported the carbon accumulation rates (CAR), which was calculated by SAR multiplying the soil C density.

        <p>Besides the soil C related parameters, other environmental variables, i.e., mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), relative sea-level rise rate (RSLR), total suspended matters (TSM), tidal range, elevation, and tropical cyclone frequency were also collected. MAT and MAP for each site were acquired from world climate data [63]. RSLR data was collected from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) database [64]. Total suspended matter (TSM, mg/L) is derived from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data, processed in the framework of the GlobColour project (http:// globcolour.info) [11]. We use the monthly averages from April 2002 to April 2012 that has a horizontal resolution of 1/24°. We extracted tidal range for each site from a newly developed global tidal range data set [37,38], representing the tidal range (that is, the difference between mean low water and mean high water), mean high water neap (MHWN) and mean high water spring (MHWS) tidal levels. Most of the compiled studies did not report the site elevations, and we thus extracted the elevation data for each site from the CoastalDEM database, which is a digital terrain model providing bare earth elevations for coastal areas with 90 m horizontal resolution [39]. We assumed that all the tidal wetlands located between the lowest and highest tidal levels, and removed the elevation data which were much higher or lower than the low and high tidal levels.Besides the soil C related parameters, other environmental variables, i.e., mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), relative sea-level rise rate (RSLR), total suspended matters (TSM), tidal range, elevation, and tropical cyclone frequency were also collected.

        <p>To assess model performance, we compared modeled vs. observed CAR data, summarized by goodness-of-fit measures. The modeled values were calculated as the expected (or fitted) CAR given environmental variables in the tidal marsh or mangrove datasets. These modeled values were then compared with the observed values. Fig. S4 shows that the modeled and observed logtransformed CAR values are close to the 1:1 reference line. We then summarized their goodness of fit by Pearson correlation coefficient, which is a measure between -1 and +1, where a higher value indicates a better fit. For all vegetation groups, the modeled and observed CAR are highly correlated (R 2 =0.51 for the tidal marsh model, and 0.47 for the mangrove model). This assessment validates that the model can predict the data well.To assess model performance, we compared modeled vs. observed CAR data, summarized by goodness-of-fit measures.

        <p>To check model assumptions, we performed residual diagnostics. Residual diagnostics in Fig. S5 show that the residuals are not correlated with CAR values. We then used the final linear models without the random effects to evaluate the strength of the simple statistical relationship for global tidal marsh and mangrove CAR projections. In tidal marshes, CAR was a linear function of RSLR and MAT (Model 1). However, CAR generally reached a maximum rate if SAR can not increase anymore. In our dataset, SAR is a function of RSLR and total suspended matter (TSM, Linear model: R 2 =0.20, p&lt;0.01, Model 3). We assumed that the TSM for each segment would not change until 2100 [11]. There will be a critical RSLR point for each segment when SAR equals the RSLR in our future projection [11]. We thus assumed that SAR would reach its maximum in the scenario when RSLR is higher than the critical RSLR point, and after this point the SAR will stop increasing with higher RSLR.

        <p>The global extrapolation was based on the 12148 coastline segments from the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modeling framework [41]. Within each coastline segment, the existing coastal wetlands, as reported by the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP WCMC), were combined [42]. The geostatistical principle assumes that vegetation distribution gradually changes with environmental factors, like latitude, longitude, temperature and precipitation [69]. We thus assumed that C accumulation at each segment has the highest similarity to that at the closest sampled site. Spatial extrapolation methods thus were used in this study to calculate the CAR of each of the tidal wetland segments: the CAR of each tidal wetland segment was estimated based on the nearest five reported CAR sites. However, due to the rare sampling points in Africa, Europe and high latitude regions, we stress that there will be less accurate for these regions in the extrapolation. (represents a moderate-emission scenario in which global-averaged radiative forcing is around 4.5 W m -2 in 2100 ) and RCP8.5 (a comparatively high-emission scenario in which globalaveraged radiative forcing is about 8.5 W m -2 in 2100) scenarios in the period between 2020 and 2100. However, the ensemble of the 21 realizations described above is an "ensemble of opportunity," as these GCMs are not independent with each other [72,73]. Thus, it fails to cover the full uncertainty of future projections and underestimates the extreme values in tails. To provide a probabilistic ensemble of climate projections and cover the tails of the probability distribution that are missing from the GCM ensemble, we use the surrogate/model mixed ensemble (SMME) method [74] to assign probabilistic weights to GCM output and generate surrogate models based on the probability distribution of global mean surface temperature this study, we reported their median value and the 95% (2.5%-97.5%) quantiles of the probability distribution.The global extrapolation was based on the 12148 coastline segments from the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) modeling framework [41].
