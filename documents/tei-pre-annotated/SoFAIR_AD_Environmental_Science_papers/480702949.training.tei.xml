        <p>The application of visible (Vis; 400-750 nm) and near infrared red (NIR; 750-2500 nm) region spectroscopy to assess fruit and vegetables is reviewed in context of 'point' spectroscopy, as opposed to multi-or hyperspectral imaging. Vis spectroscopy targets colour assessment and pigment analysis, while NIR spectroscopy has been applied to assessment of macro constituents (principally water) in fresh produce in commercial practice, and a wide range of attributes in the scientific literature. This review focusses to key issues relevant to the widespread implementation of Vis-NIR technology in the fruit sector. A background to the concepts and technology involved in the use of Vis-NIR spectroscopy is provided and instrumentation for in-field and in-line applications, which has been available for two and three decades, respectively, is described. A review of scientific effort is made for the period 2015 -February 2020, in terms of the application areas, instrumentation, chemometric methods and validation procedures, and this work is critiqued through comparison to techniques in commercial use, with focus to wavelength region, optical geometry, experimental design, and validation procedures. Recommendations for future research activity in this area are made, e.g., application development with consideration of the distribution of the attribute of interest in the product and the matching of optically sampled and reference method sampled volume; instrumentation comparisons with consideration of repeatability, optimum optical geometry and wavelength range). Recommendations are also made for reporting requirements, viz. description of the application, the reference method, the composition of calibration and test populations, chemometric reporting and benchmarking to a known instrument/method, with the aim of maximising useful conclusions from the extensive work being done around the world.The application of visible (Vis; 400-750 nm) and near infrared red (NIR; 750-2500 nm) region spectroscopy to assess fruit and vegetables is reviewed in context of 'point' spectroscopy, as opposed to multi-or hyperspectral imaging.

        <p>The use of Visible-Near Infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS) to analyze fresh produce (intact fruit or vegetables; referred to as 'fruit' throughout this article) in postharvest applications is a relatively mature topic. The basics of the spectroscopic and chemometric theory is established, and a range of instrumentation dedicated to the post-harvest sector is available. Indeed, in-line Vis-NIR spectroscopic capabilities have been offered by manufacturers of commercial packing lines for nearly three decades, and handheld equipment dedicated to fruit analyses have been available for two decades. However, while technologies such as weight cells and colour cameras are now ubiquitous in pack-lines, adoption of spectroscopic technologies into commercial post-harvest practice to assess chemical properties is still relatively limited. Thus, there is room for confirmation of past work and for further improvements to underpin adoption.The use of Visible-Near Infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS) to analyze fresh produce (intact fruit or vegetables; referred to as 'fruit' throughout this article) in postharvest applications is a relatively mature topic.

        <p>It is also now over a decade since the comprehensive review on Vis-NIRS in postharvest biology by Nicolaï et al. (2007). A review on the same topic was produced by Wang et al. (2015), followed by a similarly scoped reviews by Xie et al. (2016); Kawano (2016) and Cattaneo and Stellari (2019). In the period 2015 to February 2020, a further 18 reviews relevant to the use of Vis-NIR spectroscopy with fruit were published. Some of these reviews were relatively wide in scope, considering applications to food in general (e.g., Aleixandre-Tudó et al., 2019;Cortés et al., 2019;Kumaravelu and Gopal, 2015;Xu et al., 2019), while others review specific commodities (e.g., assessment of thick rind fruit, Arendse et al., 2017;wine grapes, Dambergs et al., 2015;avocado, Magwaza and Tesfay, 2015;olives, Stella et al., 2015) or specific attributes (e.g., detection of insect infestation, Jamshidi, 2019; TSS of a number of fruit types, Li et al., 2016;Magwaza and Opara, 2015). Yet other reviews have focused to a consideration of specific techniques applied to fruit assessment, such as data processing (Srivastava and Sadistap, 2018), methods for assessment of light scattering (Torricelli et al., 2015) or to comparison of a range of techniques, including Vis-NIRS, e.g., in assessing fruit ripeness (Li et al., 2018).It is also now over a decade since the comprehensive review on Vis-NIRS in postharvest biology by Nicolaï et al.

        <p>The Lambert-Beer-Bouguer law for dilute, non-scattering solution, as established some two centuries ago, relates absorbance (-log I t /I i , where I t is the intensity of the transmitted signal and I i is the intensity of the incident signal) to the pathlength, extinction coefficient, and concentration of absorbing analyte. In fresh produce there is, however, a high level of light scattering for light interacting with tissue, increasing the effective pathlength travelled by light and invalidating the eligibility of the Lambert-Beer-Bouguer law.

        <p>Visible region spectroscopy is based on electronic transitions of molecules that result in the absorption of light of matched energy level (i.e., at specific wavelength). The resulting, rather sharp absorption peaks, with typical full width half maximum, FWHM, of approximately 20 nm occur, are hardly affected by temperature (Zude-Sasse et al., 2002). Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) involves measure of the absorption of light associated with vibration of molecular bonds. In the assessment of intact fruit, this typically involves absorption associated with the stretching of OeH and CeH bonds (Kawano, 1994;Golic et al., 2003), associated primarily with water and storage reserves (the dominant macroconstituents of fruit). The fundamental absorption bands associated with these features lies in the infrared region (&gt; 2500 nm), with much narrower and higher absorption peaks than associated with the overtones seen in NIR region.Visible region spectroscopy is based on electronic transitions of molecules that result in the absorption of light of matched energy level (i.e., at specific wavelength).

        <p>Several tristimulus scales based on human perception are used in measurement of colour, e.g., CIELAB, Lch. These color scale values can be correlated to fruit pigment levels. For example, the hue (h) and CIELAB colour parameters a* and the ratio a*/b* were correlated to carotenoids content in apricot fruit (Ruiz et al., 2008) and chlorophyll content in apple (Knee, 1980). Colour space values have also been used in various maturity and ripening indices. For example, Uwadaira et al.

        <p>K.B. Walsh, et al. Postharvest Biology and Technology 168 (2020) 111246 features. Carotenes and xanthophylls absorb with three peak maxima in the wavelength range from 420 to 503 nm (Fig. 1). The common fruit pigment beta-carotene has a yellow to orange-red colour and a strong absorption feature near to 475 nm. The xanthophylls, lutein and violaxanthin, display an absorbance peak at approximately 435 nm, with strong absorption across the 350-500 nm range. Absorbance in the green region around 530-550 nm is caused by an anthocyanin pigmentsugar-protein complex (Merzlyak et al., 2003;Toledo-Martín et al., 2016), e.g., in apples (Iglesias and Alegre, 2009;Iglesias et al., 2012).K.B.

        <p>Several simple spectral absorption indices have been proposed for assessment of pigments. Many of these indices have been developed in remote sensing applications such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; Rouse et al., 1973) and the red-edge, and adapted for fruit assessment (Herold et al., 2009) (Table 1). In intact fruit, chlorophyll content has been related to the difference of the intensity of diffuse reflectance measured at 680 and 720 nm for apples (Zude-Sasse et al., 2000), and at 670 and 720 nm for nectarines (DA index, Ziosi et al., 2008). These indices typically involve measurement at a wavelength associated with absorption of the pigment of interest, referenced by measurement at a wavelength that is affected by scattering in the fruit tissue but not affected by pigment absorbance. NDVI is sensitive to low chlorophyll contents such as in ripened fruits, but it and many other indices are saturated at high chlorophyll content (Dash and Curran, 2004). Fruit with high chlorophyll content can be better assessed using the red-edge value (Zude-Sasse et al., 2002;Sims and Gamon, 2003;Dash and Curran, 2004). These approaches are compromised, however, if there are changes in the level of scattering in the fruit, e.g., during ripening (Seifert et al., 2015).Several simple spectral absorption indices have been proposed for assessment of pigments.

        <p>The concept of quantitative determination of analyte level in solid materials using near infrared spectroscopy was established by Karl Norris of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the 1960s, based on work with low moisture agricultural products (water in grains, Norris andHart, 1965, later published in Norris andHart, 1996). USDA work continued into application to high moisture content intact fruit and vegetables, with Birth et al. (1985) publishing on the assessment of the dry matter content (DM) on onions, and the group continuing into assessment of total soluble solids (TSS) of melons (Dull et al., 1989). A research and development program then began in Japan, with the first publication (Kawano et al., 1992) reporting on assessment of TSS on intact peaches.The concept of quantitative determination of analyte level in solid materials using near infrared spectroscopy was established by Karl Norris of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the 1960s, based on work with low moisture agricultural products (water in grains, Norris andHart, 1965, later published in Norris andHart, 1996).

        <p>The absorptivity of the overtones features seen in the near infrared region are lower than those in the infrared. This characteristic is the reason for the use of the NIR wavelength region with intact product, as it allows for effective pathlengths through fruit in the order of millimetres to centimetres rather than micrometres as experienced for wavelengths &gt; 2500 nm. For the same reason, longer effective pathlengths are possible with higher overtone features in the SWNIR region compared to overtones in the NIR region, i.e., with use of the 750-1100 nm region over the 1100-2500 nm region.The absorptivity of the overtones features seen in the near infrared region are lower than those in the infrared.

        <p>Absorption at 840, 960 and 1440 nm is associated with the first, second and third overtones of OeH stretching, while absorption at 1900 nm associated to a combination OeH feature. The position of the OeH features, however, are affected by the degree of H bonding, and thus by temperature and solute concentration. Absorption near 910, 1100 and 1700 nm is associated with C-H third, second and first overtone features. All absorption features are broad and overlapped, such that interpretation of the raw absorption spectra of fruit is difficult, beyond noting features related to water. The enabler for use of NIRS over infrared spectroscopy was the development of chemometrics, which allowed relevant data to be 'teased out' of the spectra.Absorption at 840, 960 and 1440 nm is associated with the first, second and third overtones of OeH stretching, while absorption at 1900 nm associated to a combination OeH feature.

        <p>Features to look for the instrumentation for colour measurement include (i) an optical geometry achieving an even, diffuse illumination of the object surface with an integrating sphere, a colour stable illumination source with high end instrumentation utilise Xe flash lamps, while lower cost instrumentation use halogen lamps or light emitting diodes (LEDs) and a full spectrum or tristimulus detector (Table 2). Lamp spectral output can be affected by lamp temperature (Hayes et al., 2014).

        <p>The most widespread electronic, low cost, colour detector is the ubiquitous colour camera. Common CMOS and CCD cameras utilise red, green or blue (RGB) filters centred at 700, 546 and 436 nm, respectively, in a Bayer pattern across individual pixels. These devices were first adopted into electronic packing lines in the late 1970s and are now widely implemented. RGB data can be approximately transferred to the XYZ colour coordinate space and then to other colour spaces such as the 
            <rs type="software">CIELAB</rs> (Poynton, 1997). Alternatively, XYZ values can be calculated from a 400-700 nm spectrum, typically using data at 5 nm steps, but CIE (1986) also provides colour tables at 1 nm resolution. In practice, e.g., for sorting purposes on packlines, RGB values are used directly.
        </p>
        <p>Achieving a more direct match to a colour space, several 'tristimulus' colorimeters capture light in wavelength ranges matched to the colour coordinate system of interest with the use of filtered photodetectors, e.g., the 'industry standard' Minolta CR400 (www.minolta. com) (Table 2). The expense of such specialty filters, however, can add greatly to the overall cost of an instrument.Achieving a more direct match to a colour space, several 'tristimulus' colorimeters capture light in wavelength ranges matched to the colour coordinate system of interest with the use of filtered photodetectors, e.g., the 'industry standard' Minolta CR400 (www.minolta. com) (Table 2).

        <p>The tristimulus devices are also not appropriate for complex colour analysis such as metamerism and colorant strength.

        <p>Low cost LED based instrumentation for assessment of 'colour' is becoming available.

        <p>Several LED based instruments have also been released that target assessment of specific pigment in fruit (Table 3). The DA meter, Kiwi meter and Cherry meter measure at two or three wavelengths aimed at chlorophyll or red pigment detection. The MultiPlex operates using several wavelengths, with several indices to address a range of pigments. While the Multiplex employs a diffuse reflection optical geometry, the Turoni devices and the FIORAMA probe operate using a partial transmission geometry and the IDD4 utilises a full transmission geometry in a packline application, for assessment of internal defects such as internal browning (Table 4).Several LED based instruments have also been released that target assessment of specific pigment in fruit (Table 3).

        <p>In-line applications are characterised by constraints related to speed of assessment, appropriate to packline conveyor speed, to the geometry of the conveyor belt and to operating conditions (e.g., vibration). On a positive note, ambient light conditions can be reasonably controlled using a housing over the conveyor system, in contrast to spectrometers intended for in-orchard use. The first commercial use of NIRS technology was in Japan, beginning in the late 1980s/early 1990s, with use for in-line sorting of fruit on attributes such as Total Soluble Solids (TSS) (Walsh, 2005). The first providers of in-line NIRS equipment included Mitsui Metals and Mining, Sumitomo, Fantec and Emitec (all of Japan). The early systems utilized reflectance optics, but this geometry was soon replaced by partial or full transmittance optics, presumably due to model robustness issues associated with a reflectance geometry. All systems utilized halogen lamps, with the notable exception of the Sumitomo system, which utilized diode lasers. This product was discontinued, presumably due to the added cost and to issues associated with stability of laser output intensity. Technology adoption continued in the new century (early 2000s), with release of in-line equipment by the global grading equipment manufacturers, Colour Vision Systems (Australia, now part of MAF RODA, France) and Compac (now part of Tomra, Norway), and later, Greefa (Holland), Multiscan Technologies (Spain), Aweta (Holland), Sacmi and Unitec (Italy).In-line applications are characterised by constraints related to speed of assessment, appropriate to packline conveyor speed, to the geometry of the conveyor belt and to operating conditions (e.g., vibration).

        <p>Current 'state of art' commercial systems achieve assessment of fruit travelling at a belt speed of 1 m.s -1 with simultaneous operation of multiple lanes, with sorting of up to 10 fruit per second (depending on fruit size). Current systems employ a SWNIR spectrophotometer, i.e., operate to approx. 1050 nm, in partial or full transmission geometry. Issues relevant to in-line application include: (i) the influence of the movement of the samples during the measurement interval, e.g., a 20 ms integration time involves movement of the fruit by 20 mm during assessment at a 1 m.s -1 belt speed; (ii) use of an optical geometry that minimizes the impact of changing fruit size and shape (including minimizing specular reflectance received by the detector); (iii) measurement of a representative portion of the fruit, given natural internal distribution of the constituents; and (iv) robust chemometric models (Cortés et al., 2019). Due to commercial sensitivities, performance benchmarking of the commercially available equipment is not available in the scientific literature, with (to the authors knowledge) the exception of Walsh et al. (2020). Attempts have been made to emulate issues relevant in-line systems, e.g., Ignat et al.

Unfortunately, attempts to emulate in-line systems in scientific reports are often misguided in use of design features not used in commercial instrumentation, e.g., reflectance optics or wavelength ranges beyond 1050 nm (e.g., Ignat et al., 2014;Salguero-Chaparro and Peña-Rodríguez, 2014).Current 'state of art' commercial systems achieve assessment of fruit travelling at a belt speed of 1 m.s -1 with simultaneous operation of multiple lanes, with sorting of up to 10 fruit per second (depending on fruit size).

        <p>However, although a range of instrument manufacturers have supplied the fruit and vegetables market for some decades, commercial adoption has been relatively modest relative to adoption of technologies such as machine vision and load (weight) cells. The resistance to uptake can be attributed to three factors: (i) achievable accuracy and precision, (ii) operational complexity and (ii) value created. Unlike the direct measurement of an attribute such as weight on a packline, visible-NIRS measurements are indirect, and the strength of the indirect relationship is stronger for some attributes in some applications than others. This uncertainty requires a higher level of management effort. Operational complexity relates to the need for regular calibration (model updating) of the equipment, which if not undertaken will compromise the reliability of operation (e.g., Walsh et al., 2020). An example of value created is seen in the Japanese gift fruit market which rewards premium internal quality. This 'pull factor' underpinned early technology uptake in Japan with exceptionally high prices. However, improved eating quality (e.g., higher TSS) is not associated with significant premium pricing in many markets. In western countries, a greater market pull exists for sorting for removal of internal defects for which there is a strong penalty (e.g., consignment rejection if incidence of apple internal browning exceeds 2%). Uptake of NIR sorting has thus favored defect sorting applications in western markets, despite the level of uncertainty in assessment (e.g., Khatiwadi et al., 2016).However, although a range of instrument manufacturers have supplied the fruit and vegetables market for some decades, commercial adoption has been relatively modest relative to adoption of technologies such as machine vision and load (weight) cells.

        <p>Nomenclature for the geometries of light source, sample and detector has been described in previous reviews (e.g., Chen, 1978;Nicolaï et al., 2007;Herold et al., 2009), but as the terminology is often confused in postharvest literature the terms are briefly repeated here (Fig. 1). By IUPAC definitions, the terms 'reflectance', 'interactance' and 'transmittance' refer to the quantity of light received from a 'reflection', 'interaction' and 'transmission' optical geometry. The term 'attenuance' (formerly termed extinction) is analogous to absorbance but encompasses scattering and luminescence (Cohen et al., 2008;Verhoeven, 1996). 'Apparent absorbance' is an equivalent term to attenuance. The term 'remittance' is also sometimes used, referring to the quantity of light that is received by the detector, being used in context of partial transmission geometry.

        <p>In a reflection geometry, the detector views an illuminated part of the fruit, receiving both specular and diffusely reflected light ('reflectance'). Specular reflections carry no information on the internal attributes of the sample. The intensity of the 'useless' specular reflections seen by the detector can exceed the detected diffusely reflected light in a poorly designed system. A 45°angle between detected rays, collimated illuminating rays and a planar surface will minimise the proportion of specular rays received by the detector. A fundamental limitation to application of a reflectance geometry, however, is that most of the detected diffusely scattered light will have emanated from the superficial layers of the fruit, rather than from the mesocarp which is generally of interest in assessment of fruit internal quality (see further discussion at 4.4).In a reflection geometry, the detector views an illuminated part of the fruit, receiving both specular and diffusely reflected light ('reflectance').

        <p>In transmission geometry, lamp, sample and detector are arranged such that light must pass through the sample to the detector, with no light passing directly from lamp to detector. Such arrangements can involve 180°geometry of lamp-sample-detector ('full transmission' geometry) or lesser angles ('interactance', 'remission' or 'partial transmission'). The 'shadow probe' configuration (Greensill and Walsh, 2001) is a specific partial-transmission geometry that is of use in noncontact assessment of a sample, as required for moving fruit on a packline. In this geometry, an optical probe is placed in front of a collimated light source, creating a shadow on the fruit which is viewed by the probe, with detected signal relatively independent of detector to sample distance. A limitation to use of a 180°transmission geometry with many fruit types is fruit optical density and tissue inhomogeneity. The former issue requires use of strong illumination sources and/or sensitive detectors, while the latter results in a mis-match of the optically sampled volume (i.e., fruit skin, flesh and core) to the attribute of interest (e.g., flesh TSS).In transmission geometry, lamp, sample and detector are arranged such that light must pass through the sample to the detector, with no light passing directly from lamp to detector.

        <p>Point spectroscopy provides the sum signals of attenuation, i.e., of absorption and scattering. The scattering properties of a tissue influence the effective path of photons, and thus the effective depth of penetration of light into that tissue and the effective pathlength between the light source and the detector (Cubeddu et al., 2001). However, the amount of scattering differs between fruit types (Cubeddu et al., 2001;Lu et al., 2019) and may change during fruit development (Qin and Lu, 2008;Nicolaï et al., 2008;Zerbini et al., 2015;Seifert et al., 2015). If scattering properties of a fruit change, as shown for European plum during ripening (Seifert et al., 2015), apparent absorption will be changed, upsetting any relationship between apparent absorbance and an attribute of interest. A number of studies have attempted to correct for the perturbations related to scattering, through the use of indices or chemometric data pre-treatments when entire spectra are available (e.g., Sun et al., 2020aSun et al., , 2020b)). Attempts to estimate scattering coefficients and the correct attenuation data to achieve 'true' absorption data, however, have rarely resulted in better correlations between Vis-NIR spectra and attribute levels (e.g., Nguyen Do Trong et al., 2014).Point spectroscopy provides the sum signals of attenuation, i.e., of absorption and scattering.

        <p>The 'depth of penetration' of light into a sample is defined (Verhoeven, 1996) as the inverse of the decadic absorption coefficient, i.e., the depth at which radiant power is decreased to one tenth of its incident value. Characterisation of this attribute for a given application is useful, towards understanding of the volume of the sample that is optically sampled. Peirs et al. (2003) describe a useful empirical technique based on slices of fruit to assess this characteristic. Methods to easily model light distribution through tissue for a given optical geometry and sample would also be helpful, aiding understanding of the 'optical sample' achieved with a given optical geometry and sample (fruit) type.The 'depth of penetration' of light into a sample is defined (Verhoeven, 1996) as the inverse of the decadic absorption coefficient, i.e., the depth at which radiant power is decreased to one tenth of its incident value.

        <p>The choice of optical geometry for a given postharvest application should be informed by a consideration of fruit structure in context of the optical geometry of the spectrophotometric system. The overwhelming majority (75 %) of studies published since 2015 that use Vis-NIRS to assess internal attributes of fruit have employed a reflection geometry, yet such a geometry is not used in any commercial spectrophotometer targeted to fruit application (Section 3). This may be a result of available instrumentation in research laboratories, with a reflection geometry dominating instrumentation used in food applications (Aleixandre-Tudó et al., 2019). Most food applications involve a homogenized material for which a surface (reflection) assessment can be representative of the whole sample. Future reports on application development using Vis-NIRS for fruit attribute assessment should therefore include justification of the optical geometry employed.The choice of optical geometry for a given postharvest application should be informed by a consideration of fruit structure in context of the optical geometry of the spectrophotometric system. The overwhelming majority (75 %) of studies published since 2015 that use Vis-NIRS to assess internal attributes of fruit have employed a reflection geometry, yet such a geometry is not used in any commercial spectrophotometer targeted to fruit application (Section 3).

        <p>Vis-NIR spectroscopy of intact fruit requires the passage of light through fruit 'skin' (typically exocarp and non-edible mesocarp), edible mesocarp and back out through the skin. Spectra acquired using a reflection geometry will carry primarily surface information about the sample in terms of both specular and diffusely reflected light. Variation in fruit shape and surface features will impact the level of specular reflection, affecting apparent absorption values. As specular light is identical to the incident light, its contribution to the apparent absorption spectra can be 'physically' removed by use of polarizing filters, or mathematically removed using pre-treatments such as a derivative. The latter process, however, does not allow for improvement of the signal to noise ratio of the diffuse reflection component.Vis-NIR spectroscopy of intact fruit requires the passage of light through fruit 'skin' (typically exocarp and non-edible mesocarp), edible mesocarp and back out through the skin.

Assessment of internal attributes using a reflection geometry therefore requires a correlation between the internal attribute and spectra of external layers of the fruit (as assessed by the reflection geometry).The diffuse reflected radiation will emanate in majority from within 5 mm depth of apple fruit (e.g., Lammertyn et al., 2000;Peirs et al., 2003) and from less depth for fruit with a denser (higher scattering coefficient) skin such as avocado.

        <p>The use of transmission or interaction geometries seems more appropriate for acquisition of useful spectral information from greater depths of the fruit, relative to use of reflectance geometries. This was demonstrated by Schaare and Fraser (2000) who ranked an interaction, 180°(light-sample-detector) transmission and reflection geometry in the order of highest to lowest performance for assessment of TSS of intact kiwifruit. The reflection result was compromised by the level of specular reflection and superficial layer diffuse reflection, and the transmission result was compromised by either the low detected signal (poor signal to noise ratio) or the impact of seeds and other central zone tissue on the measurement. It is also expected that models based on a reflectance geometry will be less robust in prediction of independent populations than those based on transmittance geometries, being sensitive to change in surface reflectance.The use of transmission or interaction geometries seems more appropriate for acquisition of useful spectral information from greater depths of the fruit, relative to use of reflectance geometries.

        <p>Assessment of internal defects usually requires a pass/fail (discriminant) decision. However, the defect may not be uniformly distributed within the fruit. A reflection geometry involves assessment of one area of the fruit. With a full 180°light-sample-detector geometry, light is scattered within the fruit, including a level of reflection from the internal surface of the skin, and thus this geometry effectively involves assessment of a greater proportion of the fruit volume (Fraser et al., 2003). This geometry may therefore provide a better result than other geometries, as reported in assessment of internal browning of apple (Khatiwada et al., 2016) and pear (Sun et al., 2016), and internal rot in citrus (Lorente et al., 2015).Assessment of internal defects usually requires a pass/fail (discriminant) decision.

        <p>Several approaches have been attempted to remove the influence of the skin from fruit spectra, including approaches involving combined reflection and transmission measurements (Krivoshiev et al., 2000) and subtraction of a mean skin spectrum. Attempts to estimate the true absorption coefficients, separated from scattering coefficients, for correlation to the attribute of interest are logical (e.g., Lu et al., 2019), but have not resulted in practically relevant solutions to date. Further work is appropriate in this area.Several approaches have been attempted to remove the influence of the skin from fruit spectra, including approaches involving combined reflection and transmission measurements (Krivoshiev et al., 2000) and subtraction of a mean skin spectrum.

        <p>While 'point' refers to assessment of a point on the fruit surface, the detected light received carries information on some proportion of the fruit. The volume of the fruit that is 'optically' sampled is dictated by the optical geometry employed, the scattering of light within the sample, and sample movement (e.g., for fruit moving past a detector on a pack line). For example, with in-line assessment, the movement of fruit past the spectrometer results in assessment of a larger volume of tissue than a stationary assessment.While 'point' refers to assessment of a point on the fruit surface, the detected light received carries information on some proportion of the fruit.

        <p>The application of NIRS to assessment of an attribute for a given fruit commodity should therefore also be accompanied by a description of the distribution of the attribute of interest and the likely path of light for the chosen optical geometry, together with a justification for the chosen geometry and the volume of tissue physically sampled for analysis using the reference method. This requirement was recognized early in the application of NIRS to fruit assessment (Peiris et al., 1999), but is lacking in many contemporary reports.

        <p>If the optically sampled volume does not represent the whole fruit, consideration should be given to the intent of a sampling regime. For example, the blush (sun) side of fruit typically has higher TSS and chlorophyll than the non-blush (shade) side (Kuckenberg et al., 2008). Thus, a program to assess average TSS of a consignment of fruit should consider either measurement of only blush or non-blush side, or of both. Alternatively, an optical geometry could be employed that assesses the whole fruit, e.g., multiple point measurements. For example, Trong et al. (2013) employed spatially resolved spectroscopy, with several measurements made of each fruit, achieving a TSS prediction R 2 &gt; 0.83 against refractometer TSS assessed of juice of the whole fruit.If the optically sampled volume does not represent the whole fruit, consideration should be given to the intent of a sampling regime.

        <p>The use of visible region spectroscopy for intact fruit pigment analysis is made difficult by the overlapped spectral features associated with the various pigments (Fig. 1) and by scattering (Taroni et al., 2003). Wellburn (1994) developed a simple algorithm to account for the over-lapping absorption spectra of extracted pigments in lipophilic solution. This approach was extended to measurement of chlorophylls and carotenoids in fruit extracts, enabling analysis of chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids (Nagata et al., 2007) and chlorophyll a and b, pheophytin a and carotenoids (Pflanz and Zude, 2008) in one extraction step.

        <p>Dry matter content is used as an index of: (i) storage reserves, be that the sum of starch and soluble sugar content, e.g., in pre-harvest apple or mango, or of oil content, e.g., in avocado or olive fruit; and (ii) future soluble sugar content in climacteric fruit storing starch, i.e., after ripening with conversion of starch to sugars, as seen in ripened apple or mango fruit. Thus, dry matter content of fruit at harvest is related to future eating quality. Some supply chains now set specifications on fruit dry matter content at harvest, with assessment undertaken using NIRS (e.g., Australian Mango Industry Association, 2019).

        <p>The relationship between the attributes of dry matter content and TSS is complicated by the presence of insoluble components. The NIRS measurement of fruit TSS involves spectra collected on intact fruit and TSS commonly based on measurement of the refractive index of extracted juice, i.e., ignoring the insoluble components of the fruit. Consider that a fruit of 1 kg weight with 15 % dry matter content contains 150 g of solids and 0.85 L of water. If all the dry matter content was soluble sugar, the TSS of extracted juice would be 17.6 %w/v. In practice, mango fruit with 15 % w/w dry matter has a TSS of approximately 14 in juice of ripened fruit (Subedi et al., 2007), inferring around 3% w/w dry matter is associated with non-carbohydrate material, such as cell walls.The relationship between the attributes of dry matter content and TSS is complicated by the presence of insoluble components.

        <p>NIRS PLS models for dry matter content have been developed that are relatively robust to stage of ripening, i.e., to proportion of starch and soluble sugars. However, the accuracy of TSS models is decreased by variation in starch levels (e.g., in ripening apple and mango fruit, McGlone et al., 2002;Subedi and Walsh, 2011, respectively). This issue is presumably due to the similarity of NIRS spectra of starch and sugar in water. Thus, for fruit containing starch, accuracy and precision of NIR-TSS estimates is highest in fully ripe fruit, when all starch is converted to sugar (e.g., Subedi and Walsh, 2011). This 'interference' is not an issue in fruit that store soluble sugars rather than starch as their primary reserve, e.g., stonefruit or grape.NIRS PLS models for dry matter content have been developed that are relatively robust to stage of ripening, i.e., to proportion of starch and soluble sugars.

        <p>Acidity: Acidity is a macro-constituent in fruit such as lemons and limes, which contain around 70 g L -1 (citric acid equivalents), but a micro-constituent in most fruit, e.g., peach fruit assessed by Subedi et al. (2012b) had a mean acidity of 8.8 g L -1 (citric acid equivalents). A refractometer based TSS reading of lime juice is thus dominated by the contribution of organic acids and not soluble sugars, while the reverse is true for peach. The RMSEP of SWNIRS assessment of an independent population of intact and cut lime fruit was reported by Subedi et al. (2012aSubedi et al.

Given this RMSEP value, the reliable direct assessment of acidity in fruit with lower levels of acidity is unlikely, where reliable refers to assessment of test sets not included in the calibration set. However, indirect assessment of acidity may have practical value, if the indirect association holds in practical use.

        <p>Change in firmness is associated with minor changes in chemical composition, such as pectin levels. It is unlikely that NIRS can be used to detect these chemical changes in intact fruit. Change in firmness is also associated with change in cell wall adherence. Changes in cell shape might result in changes in the scattering of light within the fruit that could be detectable in the apparent absorbance spectrum, however such changes in scattering have not been consistently liked with firmness level. Firmness levels are correlated to a range of other attributes, from water content to pigment level and starch-sugar conversion during ripening, providing fertile ground for secondary Vis-NIRS correlations (e.g., Subedi and Walsh, 2008).Change in firmness is associated with minor changes in chemical composition, such as pectin levels.

The assessed fruit varied in maturity level. As many attributes vary during fruit maturation, the ascorbic acid assessment may effectively be of another attribute with correlation to ascorbic acid level.

The statistics of discriminant sorting is discussed by Walsh et al. (2020). There are increasing claims for discrimination of populations, e.g., on variety or species, geographic origin or production system, e.g., organic. However, robustness remains to be demonstrated in terms of successful application of such models on independent test sets.

        <p>The water absorption features are temperature sensitive. Water exists in several states associated with the degree of H bonding. The effect of increasing temperature (energy status) or soluble sugar concentration is a decreased level of H-bonding and a shift in the apparent OeH associated absorption peaks to shorter wavelengths (Golic et al., 2003). In practice, the impact of fruit temperature variation on a fruit dry matter prediction is primarily on accuracy (i.e., bias) rather than precision (i.e., bias corrected RMSEP) (e.g., Acharya et al., 2014a).The water absorption features are temperature sensitive.

        <p>There are several approaches to deal with variation in sample temperature.

Another approach requires development of a NIRS model on fruit temperature and estimation of predicted attribute bias per unit sample temperature change. NIR predicted fruit temperature can then be used in a calculation to adjust the predicted attribute level. Alternatively, various chemometric methods can be employed to remove the influence of temperature from spectra. Acharya et al. (2014a,Acharya et al., 2014b recommended use of a repeatability file over orthogonal scatter correction, generalized least square weighting and external parameter orthogonalisation, but the simple approach of a global model also produced good results.There are several approaches to deal with variation in sample temperature.

        <p>The SWNIR region (750-1100 nm) is used in commercial practice (see Section 3) for assessment of internal attributes of intact fruit such as TSS and dry matter content, in preference to the use of wavelengths &gt; 1100 nm. However, most (57 %, Table 6) published reports on assessment of internal attributes of fruit involve instrumentation employing longer (&gt; 1000 nm) wavelength ranges. Longer wavelength ranges offer narrower and stronger absorption features than those observed in the SWNIR, and so may support superior performance in the assessment of internal quality attributes than use of the SWNIR. However, the absorption coefficient of water is relatively low in the SWNIR region, giving greater effective penetration depth into fruit. The lower effective penetration depth associated with use of longer wavelengths should limit performance robustness across independent populations, given variation in outer layer attributes. Even if similar results were obtained using the extended NIR region, the Vis-NIR option would be preferred for commercial purposes due to (currently) lower hardware cost (as noted by Ignat et al., 2014).The SWNIR region (750-1100 nm) is used in commercial practice (see Section 3) for assessment of internal attributes of intact fruit such as TSS and dry matter content, in preference to the use of wavelengths &gt; 1100 nm.

        <p>Calibration transfer: Calibration transfer between instruments is a relatively under reported topic for postharvest applications. A difficulty for this application is that fresh fruit samples are unstable and can not be maintained as check samples as practiced with low moisture samples. Current recommendation is either a model updating procedure (existing model based on spectra from a master instrument updated using data from the slave unit) and/or appropriate wavelength selection based on orthogonal signal correction or a partial direct standardisation procedure involving use of a set of 'transfer' spectra scanned on both instruments to create a transfer function (e.g., Igne et al., 2009;Roger, 2016;Hayes et al., 2016). Further activity in this area is therefore warranted, both in terms of transfer between instruments of the same make/model and between different instruments.Calibration transfer: Calibration transfer between instruments is a relatively under reported topic for postharvest applications.

        <p>Benchmarking: Comparison of the performance of methods or instruments reported in different publications is difficult given differences in the data sets of these reports (e.g., population structure). The machine vision community addresses this issue through a number of challenges involving access to open data sets (e.g., ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, ILSVRC; http://image-net.org/ challenges/LSVRC/) and similar open Vis-NIRS data sets, admittedly of a smaller scale, exist for other applications, e.g., for a soil application, Pierna and Dardenne (2008). To the authors knowledge, similar open data sets do not exist for postharvest examples. However, journals are encouraging submission of data sets associated to articles (e.g., https://data.mendeley.com/research-data/?search=fruit%20nirs), creating a resource for comparative chemometric studies.Benchmarking: Comparison of the performance of methods or instruments reported in different publications is difficult given differences in the data sets of these reports (e.g., population structure).

        <p>Reporting requirements: The comparison of reports on the use of Vis-NIR spectroscopy requires use of a common language. Dardenne (2010) and Williams et al. (2017) provide useful guides to the requirements for reporting of a chemometric study, relevant for any postharvest report involving spectroscopy. Williams et al. (2017) note nearly 40 items that should be reported in a spectroscopic study to enable duplication of the application and for extension of the work to industrial application. These items range from characterization of the calibration and validation sets and characterisation of the model, e.g., number of terms used in, and b coefficients of a PLSR model, to reporting of performance statistics. These guides also comment on the need for consistency in use of chemometric terms and abbreviations. For example, labelling should distinguish between calibration, cross validation and independent test set results, e.g., for the coefficient of determination associated with a calibration, R 2 c ; for cross validation, R 2 cv and for an independent test (or 'prediction') set result R 2 v or R 2 p . Population standard deviation (SD) is integral to determining the value of the NIRS technique for sorting of fruit. The technique hold value only when sample variation (standard deviation, SD) in the attribute of interest is greater than the measurement RMSEP. Indeed, the R 2 of the prediction is directly related to measurement bias corrected RMSEP (RMSEP bc ) and SD (eqn. 3).Reporting requirements: The comparison of reports on the use of Vis-NIR spectroscopy requires use of a common language.

        <p>For example, if RMSEP bc = 1, and SD = 2, R 2 will be 0.75. For the same RMSEP bc , and SD = 3, R 2 will be 0.89. Thus, if RMSEP = 1, the technique has no value for sorting of a population of SD = 1.0, but it has great value to sorting of a population of SD = 10. In consequence, the interpretation of calibration and validation statistics requires knowledge of population SD.For example, if RMSEP bc = 1, and SD = 2, R 2 will be 0.75.

        <p>Calibration set size: Some reports of NIRS application development are based on a small number of samples in the calibration set. Consider that there is a reasonable chance that two random numbers will fall in ascending order. For an extreme case, consider if spectra of hundreds of wavelength data points were acquired of only three fruit spectra. There is a probability that values at some wavelengths will randomly trend with attribute level for those fruit. This represents over-fitting of multivariate regression models.Calibration set size: Some reports of NIRS application development are based on a small number of samples in the calibration set.

        <p>For assessment of intact fruit, it is recommended that application studies include in the order of hundreds of spectra paired to reference values. Practical use of a model will require inclusion of data from multiple harvests or seasons to produce a 'robust' model, resulting in data sets of many hundreds of samples (e.g., Peirs et al., 2003;Subedi et al., 2007;Blakey, 2016). Thus, a comparison of PLS, MLR and LS-SVM modelling approaches based on spectra of 120 fruit collected at one location and time, with division to calibration and validation sets based on a ranking of reference (TSS) values (Hu et al., 2019) will provide prediction results that are optimistic relative to use in prediction of independent sets, and it is unclear if the proposed solution will hold in practical use. Blakey (2016) provides a useful case study employing nearly 10,000 samples with use of independent test sets for an avocado dry matter content application. Cross validation routines help avoid this issue, but the cross-validation groups should be large, ideally based on distinct groups of data, rather than, for example, single sample cross validation.For assessment of intact fruit, it is recommended that application studies include in the order of hundreds of spectra paired to reference values.

        <p>An indication of insufficient numbers in the calibration set is provided by a RMSEP or RMSECV value that is substantially higher than the RMSEC value is. Papers rarely present both RMSEC and RMSECV but at a comment on the difference between the values should be made in justification of the sample size used.An indication of insufficient numbers in the calibration set is provided by a RMSEP or RMSECV value that is substantially higher than the RMSEC value is.

        <p>Independent test sets: For practical implementation, a Vis-NIRS model should be 'robust' in use across production conditions, seasons, storage conditions, plant varieties and instruments, as well as measurement conditions such as ambient light and temperature. Demonstration of model robustness is a prerequisite to adoption of the technology by the postharvest industry and should be a focus of current and future studies. Many reviews have stressed the need for an independent test set, unused in tuning of model parameters, to generate prediction statistics (e.g., Williams et al., 2017).Independent test sets: For practical implementation, a Vis-NIRS model should be 'robust' in use across production conditions, seasons, storage conditions, plant varieties and instruments, as well as measurement conditions such as ambient light and temperature.

        <p>The majority of publications (66 %; with 68 % of those reports using leave one out (LOO) cross validation) are based on cross validation results only, and most remaining publications (22 % of total) deliberately select their test sets to be representative of the calibration set (e.g., ranking of samples by attribute level followed by selection of every third sample for the test set). For example, Clark et al. (2003) utilized fruit of four harvests (n = 180), with random splits of each harvest set to create the calibration (n = 120) and validation (n = 60) sets (Table 6). Validation using within-population sets will provide an indication of model performance that is optimistic in comparison to use with independent tests sets, as must happen in practical implementation.The majority of publications (66 %; with 68 % of those reports using leave one out (LOO) cross validation) are based on cross validation results only, and most remaining publications (22 % of total) deliberately select their test sets to be representative of the calibration set (e.g., ranking of samples by attribute level followed by selection of every third sample for the test set).

        <p>The selection of test sets that mirror the intended use of the model is therefore recommended, e.g., in a NIRS pack-line implementation, a model will be used in prediction of fruit from different harvest dates, growing locations and conditions and perhaps of different cultivars. Such fruit may vary in chemical matrix or in light scattering properties, e.g., change in the soluble sugar types or the level of organic acids can impact a refractometric assessment of TSS, or skin properties may change with water stress, changing scattering coefficients.The selection of test sets that mirror the intended use of the model is therefore recommended, e.g., in a NIRS pack-line implementation, a model will be used in prediction of fruit from different harvest dates, growing locations and conditions and perhaps of different cultivars.

        <p>Several reports indicate that inclusion of three years (growing seasons) of data is required to create a robust model on standard parameters such as TSS and DM (e.g., Peirs et al., 2003;Subedi et al., 2007), although this result may also be linked to the duration of a standard funding grant. Some attempts have been made to create robustness within a single season by including samples from range of water stress treatments (Anderson et al., 2017) and maturation/ripeness stages in the calibration set.Several reports indicate that inclusion of three years (growing seasons) of data is required to create a robust model on standard parameters such as TSS and DM (e.g., Peirs et al., 2003;Subedi et al., 2007), although this result may also be linked to the duration of a standard funding grant.

        <p>It is recommended that future application development studies include multiple populations. Results should be reported in terms of prediction statistics for these sets, or as cross validation results using the independent sets as cross validation groups. The results for the separate tests sets should be used to tease out the conditions that cause NIRS model accuracy or precision to decrease (e.g., sensitivity to variety, growing location, season, instrument ageing).It is recommended that future application development studies include multiple populations.

        <p>Instrumentation for colour measurement and Vis-NIRS spectroscopy has become widely available, and at decreasing cost. This availability has supported an increase postharvest research literature. These measurement technologies were initially commercially applied in the packhouse, but with the advent of handheld technology, adoption is now occurring throughout the postharvest value chain, both upstream to the orchard and downstream to distribution centers and to consumer use. Future advances in technology promise further miniaturization, enabling integration of spectrometers into other devices.Instrumentation for colour measurement and Vis-NIRS spectroscopy has become widely available, and at decreasing cost.

        <p>Multiple cameras and sensors are used in fruit pack-lines, and the trend to use of multiple probes in assessment of fruit is likely to continue, extending from packhouse to other points in the value chain. For example, Cortés et al. (2017a) integrated two Vis-NIR spectrometric probes to view opposite sides of a mango fruit in a robotic harvesting arm. An accelerometer was incorporated to assess fruit firmness and data combined into a measure of the overall quality of the fruit. The system was impractical (9 s per evaluation) but is indicative of the potential for multiple measurements and sensor fusion.Multiple cameras and sensors are used in fruit pack-lines, and the trend to use of multiple probes in assessment of fruit is likely to continue, extending from packhouse to other points in the value chain.

        <p>The following areas are recommended in future documentation on development of Vis-NIR region 'point' spectroscopy applications: Procedure (i) The error associated with the reference method (SEL) should be documented. (ii) Inter-correlations of the attribute of interest with other Vis-NIR active attributes should be documented, e.g., with pigment level or water content. Assessment of an attribute of interest with a strong secondary correlation to a Vis-NIRS assessable attribute will be robust only if the attribute of interest is always correlated to the attribute of interest. (iii) Spatial variation within the product (i.e., within a single fruit) of the attribute of interest should be described, with consideration of factors such as product maturity and storage time, and the sampling position on the fruit for point spectroscopy should be justified in terms of representation of the whole fruit. (iv) The physically sampled tissue volume used for the reference method should be matched to the optically sampled volume. (v) In some published studies, it appears that the spectrometer was selected because it was available, not because the instrument was matched to the application. The choice of spectrometer should be justified, and specifications of the spectrometer used should be documented in terms of repeatability (e.g., SD of Absorbance of 20 repeated measurements of a white reference, optical resolution as FWHM and pixel resolution), to enable a level of comparison with other published studies. (vi) The following instrumentation characteristics are offered as a benchmark condition, to be challenged for a particular fruit application: -a full or partial transmission optical geometry over a reflection geometry -use of the SWNIR region for improved depth of penetration into the sample and lower cost hardware -an optical resolution at least 10 nm and a repeatability (SD of repeated reference spectra) of at least 10 mAbs (Greensill and Walsh, 2000) -use of instruments with higher wavelength resolution to improve calibration transfer between instruments.The following areas are recommended in future documentation on development of Vis-NIR region 'point' spectroscopy applications: Procedure (i) The error associated with the reference method (SEL) should be documented.

        <p>Most current studies on use of Vis-NIRS to assess intact fruit (see Section 3) utilize a reflection geometry and a long wavelength region (1100-2500 nm). This is likely to result in spectra dominated by absorption features of the fruit skin, and thus less robust models if skin properties change between populations. Nonetheless, the 'proof is in the pudding', and any geometry or instrumental wavelength range that results in a good prediction result of populations independent of the calibration set is acceptable. Further work involving direct comparisons of geometries and other instrumentation characters is warranted to achieve consensus in these areas.Most current studies on use of Vis-NIRS to assess intact fruit (see Section 3) utilize a reflection geometry and a long wavelength region (1100-2500 nm).
