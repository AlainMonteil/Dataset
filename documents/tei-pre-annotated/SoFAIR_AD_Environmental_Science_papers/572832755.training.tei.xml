        <p>It is estimated that one third of the world's population does not have access to clean drinking water (Prüss-Üstün, et al., 2008;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013;World Health Organization, 2017). Global water shortage is due to a combination of population growth, economic development with extensive use of water in agriculture and industry, increasing standard of lifestyle, dietary changes, and climate change (Kummu, et al., 2010).It is estimated that one third of the world's population does not have access to clean drinking water (Prüss-Üstün, et al., 2008;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013;World Health Organization, 2017).

        <p>Moreover, regulations for treating civil wastewater require progressively higher performances in removal of traditional and emerging contaminants (European Commision, 2012), increasing energy consumption and operating costs.Moreover, regulations for treating civil wastewater require progressively higher performances in removal of traditional and emerging contaminants (European Commision, 2012), increasing energy consumption and operating costs.</p>
        <p>A sustainable management of water resource is therefore essential (Grant, et al., 2012). Greywater (GW) reuse can play a fundamental role, converting a significant fraction of wastewater (WW) from a waste to a valuable water resource (Friedler &amp; Hadari, 2006). GW is defined as household wastewater made of all domestic WW with the exception of toilet flushes (e.g., WW produced in bathtubs, showers, and laundry machines) (Eriksson, et al., 2002). GW may represent up to 75% of total domestic WW, accounting for up to 100-150 L/PE/day in EU and high-income countries, and for smaller volumes in low-income countries (Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013). The source separation of GW can reduce the volume sent to WW treatment plants and to minimize the energy required for their treatment (Remy, 2008;Larsen, et al., 2009) because only the more polluted fraction of domestic WW is sent to the treatment plant (Otterpohl, et al., 2002).A sustainable management of water resource is therefore essential (Grant, et al., 2012).

        <p>Additionally, reclaimed GW can be locally recycled for other uses (e.g., toilet washing, irrigation) which would otherwise employ high-quality water; in this way, a circular economy is promoted (Masi, et al., 2018).Additionally, reclaimed GW can be locally recycled for other uses (e.g., toilet washing, irrigation) which would otherwise employ high-quality water; in this way, a circular economy is promoted (Masi, et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Nature-based solutions (NBS) are defined as "actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits" (IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2016) and also as "living solutions inspired by, continuously supported by and using nature, which are designed to address various societal challenges in a resource-efficient and adaptable manner and to provide simultaneously economic, social, and environmental benefits" (European Commission, 2015a). NBS are techniques that mimic natural processes in urban landscapes, including in WW management, with low inputs of energy and chemicals.Nature-based solutions (NBS) are defined as "actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits" (IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2016) and also as "living solutions inspired by, continuously supported by and using nature, which are designed to address various societal challenges in a resource-efficient and adaptable manner and to provide simultaneously economic, social, and environmental benefits" (European Commission, 2015a).

        <p>Different NBS have been implemented, including constructed wetlands (CWs), green roofs, green walls/living walls, and urban green spaces (e.g., parks, street trees). NBS contribute to save energy through reduced cooling loads (Alexandri &amp; Jones, 2008;Castleton, et al., 2010), reduce flooding risk (Rizzo, et al., 2018), and promote a sustainable economic growth (Maes &amp; Jacobs, 2017). Several studies have demonstrated the positive effects induced by greening vacant urban land on the well-being of the people (Tzoulas, et al., 2007;South, et al., 2018;Ling &amp; Chiang, 2018). Finally, NBS support biodiversity by providing habitats for different species, significantly (Francis &amp; Lorimer, 2011).Different NBS have been implemented, including constructed wetlands (CWs), green roofs, green walls/living walls, and urban green spaces (e.g., parks, street trees).

        <p>Planning and design aspects should be taken into account when implementing NBS. The aesthetic appearance is essential for their integration with the surrounding landscape and acceptance from local communities. One of the most critical limits to the application of NBS in densely built urban areas is the lack of available space. However, the outer surfaces of buildings can provide unused spaces in densely inhabited areas. From this perspective, green roofs and green walls represent two examples of NBS that are well suited to urban areas. Moreover, the use of GW for the irrigation of NBS can be the solution to the main critique addressed to urban greening, i.e., the large amount of water to maintain it.Planning and design aspects should be taken into account when implementing NBS.

        <p>NBS for GW treatment emerged around two decades ago. In a review of the technological approaches for GW treatment by Li, et al. (2009), the only listed NBS are constructed wetlands. GW treatment using green walls and green roofs is a very recent application: the oldest study is from 2008 (Frazer-Williams, et al., 2008). GW treatment using green walls and green roofs can be considered an adaptation of subsurface flow constructed wetlands, since they are based on a vegetated porous medium where water flows either vertically or horizontally. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there is currently a lack of well-established criteria to guide the design of green walls and green roofs as NBS for greywater treatment.NBS for GW treatment emerged around two decades ago.

        <p>The present paper is complementary to recent reviews focused exclusively on constructed wetlands as a specific type of NBS for GW treatment (Arden &amp; Ma, 2018), or on specific issues such as the mechanisms of contaminant removal by plants and growing media, system longevity, and socio-cultural implications (Pradhan, et al., 2019). In particular, (Pradhan et al., 2019) addressed: significant issues related to the design of green roofs and green walls for GW treatment; pollutants removal mechanisms (both considering the plants and the growing media); problems that may compromise the durability of the systems; reduction in produced treated GW due to intense evapotranspiration in arid climates; potential damages to buildings due to the roots growth in green walls; reluctance to the reuse of treated GW, which is seen as contaminated in some cultural contexts; potential health issues related to the reuse of treated GW; costs for maintenance and operation. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the application of nature-based technologies to GW treatment and the evaluation of their performances at pilot and full-scale. Compared to existing literature, our goal is to clarify the following research questions (RQs): RQ1) are NBS appropriate for GW treatment? RQ2) is there enough available information to guide designers in the full-scale application of NBS for GW treatment? RQ3) is it possible to assess the environmental benefits connected to the application of NBS to GW treatment compared to conventional WW treatment processes?The present paper is complementary to recent reviews focused exclusively on constructed wetlands as a specific type of NBS for GW treatment (Arden &amp; Ma, 2018), or on specific issues such as the mechanisms of contaminant removal by plants and growing media, system longevity, and socio-cultural implications (Pradhan, et al., 2019).

        <p>A thorough analysis of the scientific literature was performed on the Scopus database using the keyword "greywater" (or "grey water" or "gray water" or "graywater") combined with "constructed wetlands" (or "treatment wetlands"), "green roofs", and "green walls" (or "living walls" or "green facades" or "vertical gardens" or "vertical green systems"). The meta-analysis included all NBS categories, resulting in respectively 105, 34, and 15 articles for the combinations "greywater -constructed wetlands", "greywater -green roofs", and "greywater -green walls" (and equivalent keywords). Limiting the research to the category "Article" or "Review", the numbers reduced to respectively 80, 19, and 10, indicating that about 30% of research studies were mainly conference papers. Among the intersections between the different typologies of NBS and the keyword "greywater", we were specifically interested in the applications related to greywater treatment. Therefore, we performed a distinction among studies specifically related to greywater treatment and studies related to other applications (i.e., irrigation) through a careful qualitative analysis of the abstract of each work.A thorough analysis of the scientific literature was performed on the Scopus database using the keyword "greywater" (or "grey water" or "gray water" or "graywater") combined with "constructed wetlands" (or "treatment wetlands"), "green roofs", and "green walls" (or "living walls" or "green facades" or "vertical gardens" or "vertical green systems").

        <p>Figure 1a shows the results of the bibliographic search. The studies found through the keyword "constructed wetlands" were entirely related to greywater treatment, since constructed wetlands are specifically conceived for wastewater treatment. The results indicate that constructed wetlands are the most employed NBS for GW treatment (105 studies), followed by green walls (11 studies) and green roofs (7 studies), despite the total number of studies related to green roofs is higher than those on green walls. Many applications of green roofs focus on the use of GW for irrigation, investigating the impact of GW on the health, growth, and evapotranspiration rate of the plants and on the provided services such as thermal insulation (Ouldboukhitine, et al., 2014). It should be noticed that green walls and green roofs can sometime be considered as modified applications of traditional constructed wetland systems since all these systems are based on the same fundamental principle, i.e., the coupling of biological, chemical, and physical processes within porous media enhanced by plants and microorganisms. Therefore, some studies specifically focused on green walls and green roofs could actually be included also in the "constructed wetlands" category (e.g., Ramprasad, et al., 2017), although aesthetical considerations played a more prominent role for their design in terms of visual appearance and plant choice.Figure 1a shows the results of the bibliographic search.

        <p>The temporal distribution of studies on NBS designed for greywater treatments is shown in Figure 1b. The interest in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment started in the early 1980s, with a growth around the beginning of the 21st century (Masi, et al., 2018). Initial efforts were directed to the treatment of mixed domestic wastewater, while the attention to a proper separation of wastewater and thus on the specific treatment of GW emerged later. Overall, the term "nature-based solutions" first denoted new approaches to mitigate and adapt to climate change effects (Eggermont, et al., 2015;MacKinnon, et al., 2008). Even the interest in green roofs and green walls was not initially focused on greywater treatment. In fact, the original applications of green roofs concerned the achievement of some benefits in urban areas such as stormwater mitigation and thermal insulation (Del Barrio, 1998). Similarly, green walls were firstly adopted as aesthetic elements of buildings, providing architectural and environmental benefits (Köhler, 2008;Alexandri &amp; Jones, 2008;Weinmaster, 2009). In the last decade, a growing interest in NBS designed for GW treatment can be observed (Figure 1b), and it is expected to increase in the next years, as research on the topic is now specifically dedicated to the optimization of treatment efficiency. 3 Greywater: characteristics, conventional treatment methods and critical issuesThe temporal distribution of studies on NBS designed for greywater treatments is shown in Figure 1b.

        <p>GW is the amount of domestic wastewater that excludes toilet flushing, and it is usually divided into two types: light GW, whose sources are bathrooms, showers, tubs, hand basins, and sometimes laundry; dark GW, which includes laundry facilities, dishwashers, and in some studies also kitchen sinks (Jefferson et al., 2004;Hourlier, et al., 2010;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013;Leonard, et al., 2016;Fowdar, et al., 2017). Light GW has a high potential for local treatment and reuse due to its low pollutant concentrations (Fowdar, et al., 2017). The reuse of treated GW can produce economic benefits in those countries where water resources are expensive. GW can be reused as service water (Nolde, 2000), i.e., for irrigation and toilet flush. Reuse could potentially save from 9 to 47% of potable water (Hourlier, et al., 2010;Fowdar, et al., 2017). However, GW reuse requires attention in terms of pathogen proliferation and infection diffusion, especially in case of bad system maintenance or GW storage.GW is the amount of domestic wastewater that excludes toilet flushing, and it is usually divided into two types: light GW, whose sources are bathrooms, showers, tubs, hand basins, and sometimes laundry; dark GW, which includes laundry facilities, dishwashers, and in some studies also kitchen sinks (Jefferson et al., 2004;Hourlier, et al., 2010;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013;Leonard, et al., 2016;Fowdar, et al., 2017).

        <p>The volume of produced GW depends on the population habits; up to 75-80% of wastewater is GW, over 90% in case of vacuum toilet installation. In high-income countries where water consumption per capita is higher, the fraction of GW is lower than for countries with low total water consumption, even if the highconsume countries produce larger volumes of GW (e.g., in North America 52% of GW/WW corresponds to 117 L/PE/day, while in Yemen 87% of GW/WW corresponds to 35 L/PE/day) (Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013;Leonard, et al., 2016;Kaposztasova, et al., 2014). These differences are attributed to the fact that toilet flushing represents a large fraction of WW in high-income countries, in contrast with the limited diffusion of household toilets in low-income countries.The volume of produced GW depends on the population habits; up to 75-80% of wastewater is GW, over 90% in case of vacuum toilet installation.

        <p>Household sources contribute differently to GW composition. The average contribution of three main different sources to the composition of GW are: 49% bath tubs, basins and showers; 27% kitchen sinks and dishwashers; 24% laundry sinks and washing machines. These values were calculated from twenty studies referring to sixteen countries (Australia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Denmark, England and Wales, Greece, Holland, India, Israel, Jordan, North America, Oman, Yemen) (Al-Jayyousi, 2003;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013;Edwin, et al., 2014;Maiga, et al., 2014;Vakil, et al., 2014;Noutsopoulos, et al., 2018).Household sources contribute differently to GW composition.

        <p>GW quality is conventionally assessed through the parameters summarized in Table 1; typically, most studies focus only on a subset of them (e.g., Eriksson, et al., 2002;Leonard, et al., 2016;Fowdar, et al., 2017). For pathogen assessment, different Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) are employed -among which Escherichia coli is the most used -even though their correlation with enteric pathogens has been questioned (Benami, et al., 2016). Xenobiotic Organic Compounds usually include surfactants, fragrance flavours, preservatives, and solvents. Almost all literature agrees that quantity and quality of domestic GW exhibit seasonal variations and depend on the characteristics of users (number, age, habits, activities), composition of commercial cleaning products, wastewater collection system, house facilities (e.g., dishwasher, washing machine), area type (e.g., urban, countryside, seaside). Furthermore, source and mix play an important role in the compounds that are in greywater. Usually, bath and hand basin GW contains personal care products (e.g. soap, toothpaste, shampoo), human-derived components (e.g. shave residuals, hair, skin, sebum), and also traces of faeces and urine (Eriksson, et al., 2002;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013); laundry GW contains high concentrations of chemical products (e.g. soaps and oils) and non-biodegradable fibres (Morel &amp; Diener, 2006;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013); kitchen GW (from sinks or dishwashers) contains food, oils, fats, and detergents (Noah, 2002;Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013). Both baths and laundry are the most frequent origins for faeces, skin, and food residuals, especially if there are babies in the house (Leonard, et al., 2016). By definition, urine is not included into greywater, but high concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen are usually considered indicators of urine contamination (Eriksson, et al., 2002;Leonard, et al., 2016). Storage time has also an impact on greywater characteristics: quality improves within the first day of storage but drastically decreases after 48 h (Eriksson, et al., 2002;Liu, et al., 2010).GW quality is conventionally assessed through the parameters summarized in Table 1; typically, most studies focus only on a subset of them (e.g., Eriksson, et al., 2002;Leonard, et al., 2016;Fowdar, et al., 2017).

        <p>An extensive comparison of the properties of GW from different sources was proposed by Eriksson et al., (2002). According to this study, it is hard to find in literature comparable data about parameter ranges or average values: some authors split different sources, while others consider a mixed GW; sometimes average values are given (with or without standard deviation), while other times ranges are provided. Most of the published papers organize data on either country or source bases. Table 2 adopts the country-based approach, comparing physico-chemical properties from published reviews and articles that analysed real domestic GW from 28 countries. None of the parameters exhibits a trend that allows grouping countries according to a geographic criterion. An income criterion has often been used to group countries (Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013) but the comparison of the collected studies in Table 2 does not support this choice. Some parameters have similar ranges in almost all countries. For instance, pH fluctuates around the neutral value, and typical values of total suspended solids (TSS) are below 500 mg/L with peaks of the order of 1000 mg/L. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5 ) values are usually of the order of some hundreds mg/L, although a few values larger than 1000 mg/L have been reported (e.g., Israel, Malaysia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates). Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) generally exhibit concentrations below a few tens mg/L and a few mg/L, respectively, with only a few exceptions (e.g. Palestine and Jordan). Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) instead present a huge variability both among and within countries, with variations in concentration spanning many orders of magnitude. Some studies considered synthetic GW (Diaper, et al., 2008;Hourlier, et al., 2010) due to its reproducibility and consistency in composition. Synthetic GW is usually prepared combining specific amounts of laundry soap, shampoo, oil, hand soap, etc. Different recipes have been used in terms of kind and quantity of products. In order to ensure the consistency of synthetic GW recipe, it is necessary to confirm the availability of the specific products (brand or exact composition). For this reason, Hourlier, et al., (2010) suggested a composition that uses only chemical products of technical quality. Najem &amp; Scholz (2016) provided a comparison between different recipes: some of them use commercial products, others chemical ones. There are also some studies that suggest different recipes (Rodríguez-Chueca, et al., 2014;Charchalac, et al., 2015;Chrispim &amp; Nolasco, 2017).An extensive comparison of the properties of GW from different sources was proposed by Eriksson et al., (2002). According to this study, it is hard to find in literature comparable data about parameter ranges or average values: some authors split different sources, while others consider a mixed GW; sometimes average values are given (with or without standard deviation), while other times ranges are provided. Most of the published papers organize data on either country or source bases. Table 2 adopts the country-based approach, comparing physico-chemical properties from published reviews and articles that analysed real domestic GW from 28 countries. None of the parameters exhibits a trend that allows grouping countries according to a geographic criterion. An income criterion has often been used to group countries (Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013) but the comparison of the collected studies in Table 2 does not support this choice. Some parameters have similar ranges in almost all countries. For instance, pH fluctuates around the neutral value, and typical values of total suspended solids (TSS) are below 500 mg/L with peaks of the order of 1000 mg/L. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5 ) values are usually of the order of some hundreds mg/L, although a few values larger than 1000 mg/L have been reported (e.g., Israel, Malaysia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates). Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) generally exhibit concentrations below a few tens mg/L and a few mg/L, respectively, with only a few exceptions (e.g. Palestine and Jordan). Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) instead present a huge variability both among and within countries, with variations in concentration spanning many orders of magnitude.

        <p>Table 5 summarises the main conventional GW treatment options in the last 20 years, while a comparison between these treatment processes and GW treatment through NBS is presented later (see Section 6). GW treatment processes are classified according to: type of removed contaminants and adopted process. It is of interest to underline that in general the treatment efficiency depends on operational conditions and on GW origin and composition. Bathroom and washbasin GWs contain soap up to 90% of loading mass and low concentrations of biologically-essential macro-and micro-nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium) with respect to carbon, which may not be effectively removed through a biological process. Among chemical GW treatment processes, the most adopted are coagulation and flocculation, which achieved the following removal percentages: 85-89% BOD 5 , 64% COD, 13% total nitrogen, &gt;99% TOC and &gt;99% E. coli (Ghaitidak &amp; Yadav, 2013). Among physical GW treatments, filtration is the conventional technique to remove turbidity, colloids and residual suspended solids. The removal efficiencies are reported in Table 5. Generally achieved removal efficiency of filtration systems are (Noutsopoulos, et al., 2018): 53-93% TSS, 89-98% BOD 5 , 37-94% COD, 5-98% total N, 17-73% NH 4 + -N, 0-100% total P, 12-99% MBAS, 100% E. coli, 100% Calcium, 100% Magnesium, 47% Sodium and 56.2% Potassium. Biological methods for GW treatment are divided in aerobic and anaerobic. Generally, partially submerged rotating biological contractors (RBCs) are used for BOD 5 removal and combined carbon oxidation/nitrification of secondary effluents, while completely submerged RBCs are used for the same applications with additional de-nitrification (Wu, 2019). Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) represents a widely applied wastewater and GW treatment technology, based on organic matter oxidation and nitrogen removal. According to origin of GW, the removal efficiencies of BOD 5 and COD were 59% e 70% respectively (Chrispim &amp; Nolasco, 2017). In the last decade, membrane-based techniques have been optimised to reach the GW reuse standards. Generally achieved removal efficiencies of membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems are: 98-99.9% turbidity, 100% TSS, 93-97% BOD 5 , 86-99% COD, 52-63% TN, 6-72% NH 4 + -N, 19% TP and 10-40% PO 4 3--P. MBR systems satisfy most standards for water reuse, as pH, turbidity, BOD 5 , COD, TSS and NH 4 + -N (Chrispim &amp; Nolasco, 2017). Sequencing batch reactor (SBR) systems are characterized by a great flexibility of operation and time-controlled sequence, and they are considered an effective nutrient removal technology (Rodda, et al., 2011). As a whole, BOD 5 removal varied from 80 to 98% and a similar range of COD removal values is observed. Effluents from SBR treatment of GW from showers satisfied NH 4 + -N, BOD 5 and COD standards for wastewater reuse (Lamine, et al., 2007). 4 Nature-based technologies for greywater treatment Constructed wetlands (CW) were the first NBS applied to GW treatment (see section 2). GW remediation through green walls and green roofs involves the simultaneous presence of a wide range of biological and physico-chemical processes, according to the operation mode of CW (Kadlec &amp; Wallace, 2009). The efficiency of these systems in WW treatment is due to a strong interaction among plants, biofilms, substrate, atmosphere, and nutrients from wastewater. The contact among roots, substratum, and biofilm favours different fundamental mechanisms of pollutant and pathogen removal, such as sedimentation and filtration as physical processes, precipitation and adsorption as chemical processes, and microbiological degradation and plant uptake as biological processes. The large amount of involved mechanisms entails a huge variability in removal efficiency (Arden &amp; Ma, 2018). Despite the growing interest on CW application to GW over the last decade, most literature refers to pilot systems with only a few full-scale applications. The application of green walls and green roofs for GW treatment, despite being much more recent, has been reported by a comparable number of studies. Therefore, the present section was divided into: pilot-scale constructed wetlands (section 4.1.1); full-scale constructed wetlands (section 4.1.2); green roofs and green walls (section 4.2). Given the low number of literature case studies, a comparison was also established with lightly loaded constructed wetlands (LL-CWs), namely studies performed with secondary or tertiary treated wastewater. Among the papers related to GW treatment using NBS identified through the literature survey (see Section 2), only the studies concerning experimental applications were included as references. Specifically, we analysed 30 datasets as pilot constructed wetlands, 15 studies as full scale CWs, and 10 studies as green roof and green wall applications. Compared to the studies shown in Section 2, we here analyse the subset of studies of NBS where treatment performances were quantified. Figure 2 shows the relationships among the main operational factors of the treatment systems considered in the meta-analysis, distinguishing among CWs treating GW (pilot and full scale), CWs treating lightly loaded WW, green roofs and green walls. Specifically, the upper panel represents the relationship, where available, between hydraulic retention time (HRT) and hydraulic loading rate (HLR), while the lower one represents the relationship, where available, between organic loading rate (OLR) and HLR. As expected, the three parameters are correlated. The plot in Figure 2a indicates a negative correlation between HRT and HLR with longer retention times corresponding to lower HLRs, with a few exceptions for lightly loaded CWs. This means that the two parameters provide similar information about the hydraulic behaviour of the system, and a first-order analysis of the system performance in treating GW can be investigated as a function of either HLR or HRT. As to OLR, Figure 2b shows that it is directly proportional to HLR, as expected from the relationship among these two parameters (OLR = HLR•C COD,i , where C COD,i is the COD concentration in the influent). The correlation among HLR, HRT, and OLR allows to investigate the treatment efficiency of different systems primarily as a function of only one of these parameters, and the derived optimization criteria can then be extended to the other parameters as well. Specifically, in our analysis we focus on HLR, that is available or easily calculated for most of the considered case studies while HRT and OLR were reported less frequently. Moreover, HLR is a very informative parameter for designers of systems treating GW as it allows to determine the space required for the system.Table 5 summarises the main conventional GW treatment options in the last 20 years, while a comparison between these treatment processes and GW treatment through NBS is presented later (see Section 6).

The regression lines do not include data from LL-CWs. 4.1. Constructed wetlands: applications to GW Both natural and CWs biodegrade or immobilize a range of emerging pollutants, including certain pharmaceuticals, and perform better than conventional "grey" solutions (Kadlec &amp; Wallace, 2009;Arden &amp; Ma, 2018). CWs for domestic wastewater treatment are widely recognized as a sustainable, low-cost, low maintenance technology, given the reduced energy needs and simplicity of operation (Massoud, et al., 2009;Kadlec &amp; Wallace, 2009). The most common types of CWs include horizontal or vertical subsurface flow (Figure 3), which restrict the contact with the wastewater, and provide good removal of total suspended solids and organic matter, even with low spatial footprint (about 1 m 2 /PE in cold and temperate climates, less than 0.5 m 2 /PE in warm climates (Masi, et al., 2010)). CWs can also be designed as free water surface systems, which have the highest biodiversity level amongst all the possible wetland configurations (Hsu, et al., 2011). Additionally, the abundance of organic surfaces (litter, plant stems, microalgae, etc.) supports the adsorption of persistent organic pollutants, which are then slowly degraded (Matamoros, et al., 2016). Several full-scale CWs for GW treatment are described in literature for single house applications, in many cases with the goal of reuse, as well as other applications such as in condos or institutional facilities. The use of CWs for the treatment of GW was identified as key option to promote a sustainable water management in accordance with circular economy principles (Masi, et al., 2018). Within this framework, Arden &amp; Ma (2018) listed 11 different treatment schemes and the following ranges of removal efficiency: BOD 5 63-98%; TSS 64-98% for subsurface flow systems and 25% for free water surface; turbidity 47-97%; TN 44-59%; TP 24-63%; around 1-2 log removal for bacteria, protozoa and viruses. Despite high pathogen removal, the authors highlighted the need of some additional disinfection steps (such as chlorine and UV) to meet strict water reuse standards. Arden &amp; Ma (2018) also evidenced a relatively low number of studies on CWs for GW treatment and reuse application, with only 13 peer reviewed papers describing a total of 38 systems. Moreover, the majority of the literature deals with pilot systems and very small applications, with only a few works (Laaffat, et al., 2015;Paulo, et al., 2009;Masi, et al., 2010) referring to full-scale systems. Therefore, the next section reviews the available literature, separately analysing the insights gained from pilot studies and the diffusion of full-scale applications of CWs for GW treatment and reuse.scale constructed wetlands treating greywater (GW-CWs), lightly loaded constructed wetlands (LL-CWs), and green roofs and green walls are distinguished.

        <p>The analysed pilot-scale studies included 13 peer-reviewed papers concerning constructed wetlands treating greywater (GW-CWs) and included mostly subsurface flow systems, since free water surface systems could be found only on Gerba, et al. (1999), in Arden &amp; Ma (2018) and Jokerst et al. (2012). A total of 30 individual pilot systems were analysed, with more than half being horizontal-subsurface flow systems. Given the small number of cases, a comparison was established with lightly loaded constructed wetlands (LL-CWs), namely studies performed with secondary or tertiary treated wastewater. A total of 24 individual datasets were collected from 9 peer-reviewed studies with CWs treating secondary or tertiary wastewater. From this set only 2 of the systems were surface flow. Table 6 presents the range of inflow characteristics of GW and wastewater used in lightly loaded constructed wetlands (LL-CWs). Parameter values are in line with the ranges shown in Table 2. It can be observed that LL-CWs systems receive lower concentrations than GW systems for most parameters, except for TSS where the range of inflow concentrations is similar.The analysed pilot-scale studies included 13 peer-reviewed papers concerning constructed wetlands treating greywater (GW-CWs) and included mostly subsurface flow systems, since free water surface systems could be found only on Gerba, et al.

        <p>Figures 4a-b show the range distribution of COD and BOD 5 removal rates for GW-CWs and LL-CWs, as a function of HLR. Only systems for which HLR was available (or could be calculated) are displayed. The analysis of BOD 5 data (Figure 4a) shows removal rates mostly higher than 85%, for a HLR up to 450 L/m 2 /day with a global average of 90%. This behaviour indicates that GW has a higher degradability than secondary or tertiary wastewater, which is consistent with the lower COD removal rates in LL-CWs. Similarly, BOD 5 removal rates for LL-CWs are lower than for GW-CWs, and consistently close to a plateau around 60% (global average of 62%) when HLR are higher than 500 L/m 2 /day. In fact, GW-CWs show COD removal rates higher than 60% for all systems except one, with a global average of 83%. Most LL-CW systems have a consistent removal rate around 50%, for HLR as high as 2100 L/m 2 /day with a global average of 52%. This consistency seems to show an upper removal limit capacity for organic matter removal, most likely revealing a more recalcitrant nature of COD in secondary or tertiary wastewater. The higher biodegradability characteristics of GW had been previously reported in several studies in areas of water availability (Karlgren, et al., 1967) as well as in water scarcity areas (Al-Jayyousi, 2003;Sall &amp; Takahashi, 2006). The removal efficiency for TSS of GW-CWs showed values higher than 85% for HLR between 80 and 450 L/m 2 /day (Figure 4c). For loading rates below 80 L/m 2 /day efficiencies were much lower, which might be due to biomass detachment since the corresponding HRT values are very high (&gt;5 days). Most LL-CW showed TSS removal efficiencies higher than 60% for HLR up to 500 L/m 2 /day, dropping to values lower than 50% for higher loads. Regarding nutrient removal, it was observed that inflow concentrations of TN and TP varied significantly, between 5 and 34 mg/l and from near zero to 23 mg/l, respectively. In terms of removal efficiency, GW-CWs and LL-CWs treatment systems showed a similar behaviour regarding TN, with a good removal between 46% and 78% for all systems except one (Figure 4d). On the other hand, TP removal in these systems (Figure 4e) showed very different results, including both high removal rates (close to 100%) as well as extremely low levels (reaching negative values). This wide range of behaviours could be due to the filling media in the CWs, which was mostly gravel or native stones. The only exception was a FWS system (Jokerst, et al., 2011), which had a 0.9 m deep base layer, consisting of approximately 50% native soil and 50% peat. In this system TP removal efficiency was 58%. The number of studies considering pathogen concentrations in GW-CWs is low, and the analysis of different parameters between studies also hampers a consistent meta-analysis. Overall, GW data showed significant inflow concentration in several bacterial parameters, including Total Coliforms (TC), Faecal Coliforms (FC) and E. coli, stressing the importance of treating GW prior to direct contact use (see Table 2). GW-CWs exhibited significant removal levels for TC (Figure 4f), higher than 2.8 log units for all systems analysed. Nevertheless, outlet concentrations in most of the systems reached average concentrations in the order of 104 (Gerba, et al., 1999;Winward, et al., 2008), which is not enough to meet standards consistent with several reuse applications. LL-CWs had removal rates lower than 2 log units, but inflow concentrations where typically one order of magnitude lower than GW-CWs. From a visual assessment of the possible correlation between TC removal and HLR, the existence of a specific connection seems unlikely. This can suggest that the main removal mechanism could be due to adsorption on media and filtration processes and, thus, strictly related to the physico-chemical properties of the growing medium (Prodanovic, et al., 2017). 6 andTable 10). 4.1.2 Full scale systems The analysis of peer-reviewed manuscripts on full-scale systems evidenced the suitability of CWs for GW treatment and reuse at real scale and conditions (Figure 5). Laaffat et al. (2015) reported satisfactorily high removal efficiencies from a 100 days long monitoring of a horizontal flow constructed wetland (HF CW) treating GW from a primary school in Marrakesh: BOD 5 &gt;92%, COD &gt;85%, TSS &gt;94%, TN &gt;45%, TP, TC &gt;99%. Paulo et al. (Paulo, et al., 2009) evidenced a high buffer capacity in terms of treatment performance of a hybrid HF/VF system treating GW from a single house with 9 people; the CW faced both daily and monthly variable influent GW loads, showing high stability in overall treatment performances over a 120 days monitoring period (Table 8). Results from different CW systems in Mediterranean area monitored under the SWAMP (EC FP5) and the Zero-M (EC MEDA) projects (Regelsberger, et al., 2005;Scheumann, et al., 2009;Masi, et al., 2007;Masi, et al., 2010) demonstrated generally high removal efficiencies (see Table 8 and Figure 4). These full-scale studies also highlighted interesting information: (i) an overall sustainable water management approach can lead to high pollutant concentrations (relatively to the GW literature ranges), since less water is used thanks to water saving devices; (ii) a polishing FWS stage can be adopted to both accumulate treated GW for reuse and naturally disinfect it, since 4-6 logs of removal and concentrations of 1-200 MPN/100ml were observed; (iii) a FWS tertiary unit can avoid the use of technological disinfection units for unrestricted reuse; this choice is of particular interest for developing countries, even though the intense evapotranspiration can highly reduce the amount of produced "new water"; (iv) the use of a FWS stage can lead to occasional increases in effluent COD in warm periods due to algae bloom or volume reduction by evaporation, even if observed concentrations remain low (COD always below 100 mg/l). For particular cases with low values of ammonia and TN, the adoption of a HF system can bring advantages in comparison to VF because of the different feeding needs (generally VF systems, operated in batch, are more energy dependant in comparison to HF ones). The growing demand for employing NBS to treat GW is exemplified by the recently revised German guidelines for design, construction, and operation of CWs for domestic and municipal wastewater (DWA), which specifically discuss design indicators dedicated to the case of GW treatment (Nivala, et al., 2018). A survey of technical literature was hence performed to investigate the diffusion of CWs for GW treatment and reuse. To this aim, two sources were analysed: (i) Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanAwww.susana.org) case study database; (ii) personal information collected from Global Wetland Technology members (GWT -www.globalwettech.com), a consortium of 10 among the most relevant design companies in the field of CWs. The results of this search are summarised in Table 9, which reports details from 15 cases of HF and VF CW applications in real conditions for different GW types (from light GW of showers and washbasins to dark GW of kitchens, as well as car washing GW). The scale of application and the volume of treated GW are generally much higher than those reported in peer-review literature; CW systems up to hundreds of square meters were designed for real conditions, demonstrating the possibility to implement NBS for GW treatment at large scales and not only for single houses. For those systems for which removal efficiencies were available, the results are consistent with pilot-scale studies, in particular for organic matter removal and TSS (Figure 4). The use of additional disinfection units seems to strongly vary among countries and scales, probably driven by different legislative water quality standards for reuse, while the reuse of treated GW for toilet flushing without additional disinfection also occurs. Various reuses of treated GW were proposed, ranging from irrigation to toilet flushing, as well as more productive reuses such as agro-forestry and industrial reuse (i.e., concrete mixing and aquaculture). It is important to stress that the analysis of technical literature presented here only represents a limited portion of real applications, and we reasonably expect a much larger number of similar applications worldwide. Therefore, CWs should be considered a mature technology for the treatment of GW and successive reuse. Table 9: A list of full-scale CW for GW treatment and reuse from Global Wetland and Technology Database. 4.2 Urban green infrastructures: Green walls and green roofs Green roofs and green walls (Figure 6) represent important techniques for urban reconciliation ecology (Francis &amp; Lorimer, 2011), and are becoming integrated parts of modern building in many countries. Green roofs are vegetated surfaces installed on a rooftop and generally made up of modular systems consisting of an insulation layer, a waterproof membrane, and a vegetation layer planted in a growing substrate. The depth of this substrate can range from 50 mm to over 1 meter, depending on the weight-bearing capacity of the roof and the type of vegetation (Oberndorfer, et al., 2007). Green walls are vertical systems usually attached to internal or external walls, and are made up of planted containers attached to the wall itself. The vegetation is hence rooted across the entire vertical structure of the wall and not only at its base as for green facades (Manso &amp; Castro-Gomes, 2015). These green infrastructures were originally developed for aesthetic and insulation purposes (Teotonio, et al., 2018), and they have only been recently proposed for wastewater treatment systems. Green roofs and green walls for GW treatment operate similarly to reed beds, in which GW percolates through planted pots filled with a combination of granular media such as vermiculite, sand, growstone, expanded clay, phytofoam, coco coir, and perlite (Prodanovic, et al., 2017). However, their low space requirements represent a relevant advantage compared to the conventional reed beds (Masi, et al., 2016). If GW treatment is sought, the choice of plants must fulfil multiple criteria: fitness to local climatic conditions and high survival capacity, aesthetic appearance (e.g., perennial species), low space required for root growth, low weight, and good removal capacity of nutrients (Castellar da Cunha, et al., 2018). Additional features such as potential use for agricultural or medical purposes are certainly added values (Eregno, et al., 2017). In this section, we provide a case study review of green roofs and green walls used as GW treatment systems, with specific focus on removal efficiencies of the main contaminants. It is interesting to notice that the first studies on the irrigation of green infrastructures with GW focused on pilot applications on actual systems, while laboratory studies were only performed later to investigate the role of different treatment processes or to compare different growing media. In the present section we first analyse laboratory studies, continuing with pilot studies, and concluding with real cases. The first example is given by Fowdar et al. (2017), who employed a set of laboratory columns filled with inert material (sand, gravel) and planted with ornamental species (climbers and flowers) to reproduce a living wall system. The study investigated different operational and design aspects in terms of loading rates, saturated zone design, vegetation species, filling materials, inflow concentrations, and dosing frequency. Compared to traditional stormwater biological filters, the authors tested if creating a saturated layer at the filter bottom can improve nitrate removal through denitrification. However, it was observed that denitrification was limited by the availability of organic matter in the saturated layer. The only carbon source provided by the GW was quickly removed in the upper layers, limiting the presence of biodegradable matter where denitrification could occur. The performance of the system in terms of BOD 5 removal proved to be very high, while some improvements were still required for nitrogen and phosporous removal. A follow-up experimental study (Fowdar, et al., 2018) investigated the main mechanisms governing removal and transformation of nitrogen in living wall biofiltration systems, with particular attention to dissolved organic nitrogen. The limitation observed in the previous experimental setup was addressed redesigning the saturation zone to enable the injection of an external source of organic carbon. However, the application of an isotopic tracer ( 15 N-urea) revealed a minor removal contribution provided by nitrification-denitrification pathway. Plant assimilation and media adsorption were likely predominant, highlighting the importance in plant selection in the design phase. Another laboratory study (Prodanovic, et al., 2017), examined different growing media for green walls. The study aim was to identify the underlying pollutant removal processes and to maximize the treatment capacity of the system. Experimental tests were performed in vertical columns filled with different porous media and without vegetation. The tested materials were selected on the basis of physical and chemical characteristics such as specific weight, water and nutrient retention capacity, porosity, capacity to distribute water and support plant growth, sustainability, and local availability. Among the hydraulically fast and slow media identified as suitable media, the analysis identified perlite and coconut coir as the two best performing media, suggesting their combined use as best option. Mixing two materials with different hydraulic behavior allows, on one hand, to limit clogging issues, and, on the other hand, to increase the treatment efficiency, providing enough time for biological processes. A following study (Prodanovic, et al., 2018) examined the removal performance of different mixes of coir and perlite in terms of TSS, TN, TP, COD and E. coli, providing a complete picture about the physico-chemical removal processes.It was observed that biological removal processes dominate nitrogen and COD removals, while physico-chemical processes dominate removal in fast media. Some pilot-scale implementations of green roofs irrigated with GW include adaptations of CWs located on building rooftops, as in the Green Roof-top Water Recycling System (GROW), which was developed by Water Works UK Ltd. (London, UK; patent number GB 2375761) (Avery, et al., 2007). The system consists of an inclined framework of interconnected horizontal troughs and weirs planted with several plant species. The GROW system was compared with more established horizontal flow CW and vertical flow CW for the treatment of domestic GW (Frazer-Williams, et al., 2008). The study found a better efficiency of the GROW system in reducing suspended solids and turbidity, with no significant difference in effluent BOD 5 and COD concentrations. Ramprasad et al. (2017) evaluated the performance of the GROW system under various climatic conditions, organic loading rates, and flow rates in order to understand the suitability of the system for different geographic areas and climates. Moreover, they focused on the performance of the system in removing surfactants from personal care products. The system was able to reach a removal efficiency higher than 80% for all the parameters with values of HRT and HLR ranging from 0.8 to 1.3 days and from 7.75 to 15 L/m 2 /day, respectively. Overall, the removal efficiency depended on seasonality and hydraulic parameters. A lower environmental impact of GROW system compared to membrane based technologies was demonstrated through a Life Cycle Assessment, mostly because of the electricity consumption during the use phase (Memon, et al., 2007). An experimental study concerning green roofs irrigated with GW was performed in the city of Al Ain (United Arab Emirates), testing the difference in treatment capacity between intensive and extensive roof systems (Chowdhury &amp; Abaya, 2018). Intensive and extensive prototypes were differentiated only for the depth of the growing layer, while other characteristics were identical for the two tipologies. Generally, intensive green roof prototypes showed higher removal performances compared to extensive prototypes and this can be attributed to the greater depth of the soil. However, the short retention time of the experimentmuch less than 24 h -limited the removal efficiency for certain parameters such as turbidity and COD in both systems. The first application of vegetated walls for GW treatment was developed in Norway and consisted in a walladapted biological filter intermittently dosed with domestic GW (Svete, 2012). In spite of the limited spatial footprint (filter surface area around 0.54 m 2 ), the system was able to operate with good removal performance as enhanced aerobic conditions and residence times supported fast biogeochemical reaction rates. The system included three different sections, among which the planted one showed higher removal rates, satisfying all the expected treatment perfomances for biological filters in Norway, with the exception of E. coli. However, an Anova analysis demonstrated that the contribution of vegetation to treatment was not relevant, suggesting that the higher perfomance were most probabily due to higher residence time and confirming the importance of this parameter. A pilot installation of a green wall was conducted by Masi et al. (2016) for the treatment of GW produced by an office building in Pune (India). The system involved a series of pots filled with porous media (LECA mixed with either sand or coconut fibres) and with different plant species. The pots were arranged in 12 vertical columns (6 pots per column), and perforated pipes fed the upper row while the lower rows of pots received water through vertical percolation. The effluent collected at the bottom of the wall was then reused for garden irrigation. The main conclusion of the study was related to the importance of the substrate used in the green wall. Even though TN removal was limited, the system was successful in minimizing the treatment footprint while ensuring an effluent quality that respected the Indian regulations for reuse for irrigation purposes and, for some samples, for toilet flushing. Another example of full-scale application (VertECO -Vertical Ecosystem) was installed in a hotel in Lloret de Mar (Spain) (Gattringer, et al., 2016). It consisted of an indoor living wall aimed to treat 1 m 3 of GW per day. An interesting outcome of the study deriving from the application of a Life Cycle Assessment was that the environmental impact of such systems could be improved by using alternative materials, such as plastics or wood, for the realization of the wall, and by employing sustainable energy sources, such as photovoltaic energy. The effluent water quality was also analysed in terms of micropollutants (endocrine disrupting compounds and pharmaceutical active compounds), obtaining generally high removal efficiencies apart from a few exceptions. A different application was proposed by Eregno et al. (2017). The GW biofilter system was composed of a sequence of a primary settler, an unsaturated fixed-film biofilter, and a secondary clarifier, followed by an infiltration system (unvegetated filtration columns). The effluent from the filtration columns was then used for the hydroponic cultivation of lettuce in a green wall, with the addition of urine as a nutrient source for plant growth. The focus of the study concerned the realibility of using treated greywater to cultivate food crop and the consecutive possibility of consuming lettuce irrigated with treated GW without health risks through a quantitative microbial risk assessment. The quality of the effluent from the infiltration columns was satisfactory in terms of nutrient and bacteria removal. While the previous study provided a considerable amount of knowledge about the application of green walls and green roofs for GW treatment and reuse, a number of questions are still unsolved. The most relevant issue that limits the application of these systems for GW treatment is the lack of sizing principles to predict the amount of GW that can be fed and efficiently treated by a specific system. The indications can be obtained from the existing studies will be discussed in section 5. Another important issue that will require further research efforts is how the ensure durability of these systems. Problems that can mine durability of these NBS span from clogging of porous medium to structural ageing, and long-term studies will be necessary to understand these issues and avoid loss of treatment efficiency over time. Finally, as stressed by Pradhan et al. (2019), difficulties related to social acceptance of treated GW reuse should not be dismissed.Figures 4a-b show the range distribution of COD and BOD 5 removal rates for GW-CWs and LL-CWs, as a function of HLR. Only systems for which HLR was available (or could be calculated) are displayed. The analysis of BOD 5 data (Figure 4a) shows removal rates mostly higher than 85%, for a HLR up to 450 L/m 2 /day with a global average of 90%. This behaviour indicates that GW has a higher degradability than secondary or tertiary wastewater, which is consistent with the lower COD removal rates in LL-CWs. Similarly, BOD 5 removal rates for LL-CWs are lower than for GW-CWs, and consistently close to a plateau around 60% (global average of 62%) when HLR are higher than 500 L/m 2 /day. In fact, GW-CWs show COD removal rates higher than 60% for all systems except one, with a global average of 83%. Most LL-CW systems have a consistent removal rate around 50%, for HLR as high as 2100 L/m 2 /day with a global average of 52%. This consistency seems to show an upper removal limit capacity for organic matter removal, most likely revealing a more recalcitrant nature of COD in secondary or tertiary wastewater. The higher biodegradability characteristics of GW had been previously reported in several studies in areas of water availability (Karlgren, et al., 1967) as well as in water scarcity areas (Al-Jayyousi, 2003;Sall &amp; Takahashi, 2006). The removal efficiency for TSS of GW-CWs showed values higher than 85% for HLR between 80 and 450 L/m 2 /day (Figure 4c). For loading rates below 80 L/m 2 /day efficiencies were much lower, which might be due to biomass detachment since the corresponding HRT values are very high (&gt;5 days). Most LL-CW showed TSS removal efficiencies higher than 60% for HLR up to 500 L/m 2 /day, dropping to values lower than 50% for higher loads. Regarding nutrient removal, it was observed that inflow concentrations of TN and TP varied significantly, between 5 and 34 mg/l and from near zero to 23 mg/l, respectively. In terms of removal efficiency, GW-CWs and LL-CWs treatment systems showed a similar behaviour regarding TN, with a good removal between 46% and 78% for all systems except one (Figure 4d). On the other hand, TP removal in these systems (Figure 4e) showed very different results, including both high removal rates (close to 100%) as well as extremely low levels (reaching negative values). This wide range of behaviours could be due to the filling media in the CWs, which was mostly gravel or native stones. The only exception was a FWS system (Jokerst, et al., 2011), which had a 0.9 m deep base layer, consisting of approximately 50% native soil and 50% peat. In this system TP removal efficiency was 58%. The number of studies considering pathogen concentrations in GW-CWs is low, and the analysis of different parameters between studies also hampers a consistent meta-analysis. Overall, GW data showed significant inflow concentration in several bacterial parameters, including Total Coliforms (TC), Faecal Coliforms (FC) and E. coli, stressing the importance of treating GW prior to direct contact use (see Table 2). GW-CWs exhibited significant removal levels for TC (Figure 4f), higher than 2.8 log units for all systems analysed. Nevertheless, outlet concentrations in most of the systems reached average concentrations in the order of 104 (Gerba, et al., 1999;Winward, et al., 2008), which is not enough to meet standards consistent with several reuse applications. LL-CWs had removal rates lower than 2 log units, but inflow concentrations where typically one order of magnitude lower than GW-CWs. From a visual assessment of the possible correlation between TC removal and HLR, the existence of a specific connection seems unlikely. This can suggest that the main removal mechanism could be due to adsorption on media and filtration processes and, thus, strictly related to the physico-chemical properties of the growing medium (Prodanovic, et al., 2017). 6 andTable 10). 4.1.2 Full scale systems The analysis of peer-reviewed manuscripts on full-scale systems evidenced the suitability of CWs for GW treatment and reuse at real scale and conditions (Figure 5). Laaffat et al. (2015) reported satisfactorily high removal efficiencies from a 100 days long monitoring of a horizontal flow constructed wetland (HF CW) treating GW from a primary school in Marrakesh: BOD 5 &gt;92%, COD &gt;85%, TSS &gt;94%, TN &gt;45%, TP, TC &gt;99%. Paulo et al. (Paulo, et al., 2009) evidenced a high buffer capacity in terms of treatment performance of a hybrid HF/VF system treating GW from a single house with 9 people; the CW faced both daily and monthly variable influent GW loads, showing high stability in overall treatment performances over a 120 days monitoring period (Table 8). Results from different CW systems in Mediterranean area monitored under the SWAMP (EC FP5) and the Zero-M (EC MEDA) projects (Regelsberger, et al., 2005;Scheumann, et al., 2009;Masi, et al., 2007;Masi, et al., 2010) demonstrated generally high removal efficiencies (see Table 8 and Figure 4). These full-scale studies also highlighted interesting information: (i) an overall sustainable water management approach can lead to high pollutant concentrations (relatively to the GW literature ranges), since less water is used thanks to water saving devices; (ii) a polishing FWS stage can be adopted to both accumulate treated GW for reuse and naturally disinfect it, since 4-6 logs of removal and concentrations of 1-200 MPN/100ml were observed; (iii) a FWS tertiary unit can avoid the use of technological disinfection units for unrestricted reuse; this choice is of particular interest for developing countries, even though the intense evapotranspiration can highly reduce the amount of produced "new water"; (iv) the use of a FWS stage can lead to occasional increases in effluent COD in warm periods due to algae bloom or volume reduction by evaporation, even if observed concentrations remain low (COD always below 100 mg/l).

Green roofs are vegetated surfaces installed on a rooftop and generally made up of modular systems consisting of an insulation layer, a waterproof membrane, and a vegetation layer planted in a growing substrate. The depth of this substrate can range from 50 mm to over 1 meter, depending on the weight-bearing capacity of the roof and the type of vegetation (Oberndorfer, et al., 2007). Green walls are vertical systems usually attached to internal or external walls, and are made up of planted containers attached to the wall itself. The vegetation is hence rooted across the entire vertical structure of the wall and not only at its base as for green facades (Manso &amp; Castro-Gomes, 2015).

Another important issue that will require further research efforts is how the ensure durability of these systems. Problems that can mine durability of these NBS span from clogging of porous medium to structural ageing, and long-term studies will be necessary to understand these issues and avoid loss of treatment efficiency over time. Finally, as stressed by Pradhan et al. (2019), difficulties related to social acceptance of treated GW reuse should not be dismissed.</p>
        <p>The optimization of the removal processes in NBS involves the selection of appropriate plant species and substrates as growing materials, the assessment of optimal hydraulic parameters, and the definition of suitable operating conditions. While these issues have been widely addressed for constructed wetlands, much less information are available for green walls and green roofs. Some works started to discuss and analyse the selection criteria for defining the best combination of design parameters involved in the realization of vegetated GW treatment systems (Castellar da Cunha, et al., 2018;Pradhan, et al., 2019). However, a fundamental issue that has not been fully clarified yet is the influence of operational factors on removal efficiencies. The identification of optimal design parameters for green walls and green roofs is essential to ensure high pollutant removal and an efficient use of space. Hence, this section presents a critical summary of the previously discussed results about the relationship between the treatment capacity of green walls and green roofs and HLR, with specific regard to the removal of organic matter, nutrients, and bacteria. From a design perspective, high values of HLR are desirable because they result in NBS that can receive large GW amounts of with a low spatial footprint. However, high HLR values increase the velocity of filtration and reduce HRT, liming the contact time between GW and microbial biofilms and plant roots. Excessively high values of HLR are hence expected to reduce the removal of contaminants (and particularly those more prone to leaching). Tables 10 and11 summarize the design parameters, operational characteristics, and removal efficiencies of the previously discussed case studies. Table 10 reports the main parameters of each study in terms of substrate, plants, and operational factors -flow, HLR, OLR, and HRT -distinguishing between pilot and laboratory studies. All these parameters control the biogeochemical and physical processes occurring along each pathway, affecting the treatment efficiency. For studies that did not report values of surface HLR in L/m 2 /day, these values were calculated dividing the flow rate by the horizontal area of the system. Table 11 presents the treatment efficiency, indicating the effluent concentrations and the percentage of removal of the considered contaminants. The ranges of removal efficiency reported in Table 11 refer to all the configurations investigated in each study, also including configurations that showed a low performance and were thus excluded as effective treatment systems. As shown in this table, the systems generally exhibited good removal performances for organic matter (BOD 5 and COD), with removal rates that reach 90-99% and outlet concentrations that fulfill the limitations for most non-potable water reuse (Ramprasad, et al., 2017;Fowdar, et al., 2017;Svete, 2012). In some studies (Masi, et al., 2016;Prodanovic, et al., 2017;Prodanovic, et al., 2018), a high variability in organic removal efficiency was observed. The performance of the systems in removing microorganisms has been evaluted using different bacterial indicators, such as E. coli, total coliforms, and faecal coliforms, depending on the parameter analysed in each study (see Table 11). Removal efficiencies were quite variable, and sometimes they prevented achieving the limits for water reuse (Ramprasad, et al., 2017;Chowdhury &amp; Abaya, 2018;Svete, 2012;Prodanovic, et al., 2017;Prodanovic, et al., 2018). A solution for this issue could be the addition of a disinfection unit in order to achieve the standard limits for reuse (Ramprasad, et al., 2017). 4 shows the removal efficiencies of BOD 5 , COD, TSS, TN, TP, and pathogens as a function of HLR. It should be noticed that the values shown in Figure 4 differ from those reported in Table 11 because the latter represent the whole range of variation obtained in all experiments, while Figure 4 considers only the best experimental configurations identified in each study in order to highlight the treatment capacity under optimal conditions for each system. However, in those cases when various typologies of systems were tested, the analysis included the results related to the different typologies in order to compare systems with different characteristics and implemented according to different aims (Chowdhury &amp; Abaya, 2018). In the study by Fowdar et al. (2017), the configurations with Carex appressa and Strelitzia Reginae showed high performances for different water quality parameters and have been hence considered here. The configuration with LECA and coir was chosen as reference in Masi et al. (2016). Regarding the studies conducted by Prodanovic et al. (2017Prodanovic et al. ( , 2018)), we considered the results related to coconut coir, that has proved to have the highest potential to remove pollutants from greywater (Prodanovic, et al., 2017), and those related to the 1:3 to 2:1 mixes (perlite:coir 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1) (Prodanovic, et al., 2018). For all cases, transient operations during the start-up phase or intermittent loadings were not considered because they are considered not stable (Fowdar, et al., 2017;Ramprasad, et al., 2017). For BOD 5 and COD, higher removal efficiencies were found when low HLR values were applied (Figures 4a-b). This behavior can be explained considering that organic matter is mostly removed by microbial degradation, and an increase of HLR entails a reduction of HRT, resulting in less microbial removal of organic pollutants. However, the relationship between removal efficiency and HLR in Figures 4a-b is nonlinear, and increases in HLR are not necessarily detrimental for removal performances. For instance, the high removal efficiency of organic matter observed for HLR = 670 L/m 2 /day (Svete, 2012) can be attributed to high dosing frequency with low greywater volumes. The results in Figures 4a-b indicate that a high treatment performance of organic matter can be obtained for values of HLR up to 600-800 L/m 2 /day. The removal of TSS seems to be the least problematic since most of the systems showed very high efficiencies (Figure 4c). The relatively low removal efficiency (~50%) of TSS observed for HLR&lt;100 L/m 2 /day (Fowdar, et al., 2017) with Carex appressa can be attributed to leaching of plant exudates as well as decomposition of plant roots. However, this result is in contrast with the results obtained in stormwater biofiltration studies in which high TSS removal was observed with C. appressa (Bratieres, et al., 2008) and further investigations are hence necessary. For HLR around 1000 L/m 2 /day, a drop in TSS removal efficiency was observed (Masi, et al., 2016). Concerning the removal of total nitrogen, Figure 4d apparently suggests that increasing HLR implies lower removal efficiency. However, this behavior is largely influenced by a couple datapoints (Svete, 2012;Masi, et al., 2016) and deserves careful discussion; on one hand, it should be noticed that the value indicated for HLR=1000 L/m 2 /day (Masi, et al., 2016) is likely underestimated because it is only related to removal of Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TN data were not collected), which implies that denitrification is neglected. Moreover, the low TN removal efficiency (~30%) at HLR=670 L/m 2 /day (Svete, 2012) can be attributed to the absence of anaerobic conditions that hampered denitrification. On the other hand, Eregno et al. (2017) found high treatment efficiency (~80%) with high HLR (600 L/m 2 /day). Despite the slight decrease in efficiency with increasing HLR, it is concluded that high HLR values are not necessarily detrimental for TN removal provided that the system configuration ensures proper conditions (i.e., anaerobic conditions and carbon availability). As to total phosphorus, Figure 4e shows no clear trend between HLR and TP removal. High removal efficiencies (&gt;70%) were obtained up to 700 L/m 2 /day, suggesting that TP removal was mainly governed by fast processes (e.g., sorption) and hence stressing the importance of the proper choice of growing substrates. Removal efficiency of microorganisms in Figure 4f does not exhibit any clear correlation between pathogen removal and HLR. Efficiencies higher than 2 log units were found even at high HLR, suggesting that filtration processes play an important role in removing pathogens. The previous findings indicate that the best performances were found for low values of HLR, while efficiencies varied significantly for HLR larger than 500 L/m 2 /day according to the considered parameter. Specifically, BOD 5 , COD, and TSS showed more stable removal efficiencies, while TN and TP removal appear to be more dependent on the type of system. In fact, the removal of nitrogen is strictly dependent on the occurring of suitable conditions for denitrification, while the removal of phosphorus is strongly influenced by the specific type of growing medium. Analogously to what was established for HLR, it is possible to identify a minimum threshold value of retention time of the order of few hours in order to achieve acceptable removal efficiencies. In terms of OLR, it is possible to notice that applications with high removal performances refer to values of organic loading rate up to 100 g COD /m 2 /day. 6 Environmental assessment of greywater treatment processes GW reuse has both positive and negative environmental impacts (Vuppaladadiyam, et al., 2018). The acknowledged environmental positive issues are: facing water scarcity by recovering water resources, minimising sewage production, and reducing water supply costs. It was observed that GW reuse in urban areas can decrease of about 30% water consumption in buildings (Memon, et al., 2007) and GW reuse in multi-story buildings in Israel may save 150 Mm 3 /y of freshwater use (Oron, et al., 2014). Furthermore, the application of GW in soils and agriculture sector can enhance the availability of organic matter and nutrients (Memon, et al., 2007). Drawbacks related to GW reuse concern microbial risks and the presence of metals and micropollutants, which represent a possible threat for human health (Turner, et al., 2016). Microbial risks are due to the presence of pathogens from faecal contamination, skin, food preparation and mucus, such as E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rotavirus, Legionella spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus (Blanky, et al., 2015). Table 12 summarises 30 Life Cycle Analyses and environmental assessment studies performed in the last decades to evaluate pros and cons of GW reuse according to GW origins, treatment technology and reuse purpose. Vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands represent a valid mitigation tool for greenhouse gas emissions, entailing a reduction of about 50% in emissions compared to traditional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) (Pan, et al., 2011). This improvement for vertical flow CW is distributed among transportation stage (up to ~19 kg CO 2 -eq/PE/y less), treatment stage (up to ~40 kg CO 2 -eq/PE/y less), and sludge handling. A considerable reduction in energy consumption can be obtained by switching from centralised WW reuse systems (1.224-1.914 kWh/m 3 ) to decentralised WW and GW reuse systems (0.246-0.970 kWh/m 3 ), with a reduction of up to ~80% (Chang et al. 2017). Another remarkable advantage of WW and GW reuse systems compared to conventional WWTP is the reduction of the amount of treated WW released into natural water bodies, with a consequent decrease of contaminant loads and concentrations (Chang et al. 2017). Several advantages can be obtained from GW reuse of different origin. For example, do Couto et al., (2013) demonstrated that the quality of airport-produced GW is similar to household GW and can be easily treated for reuse purposes. This led to large water savings (-40%) and cost reductions (-25%), in addition to the other environmental benefits. Sgroi et al. (2018) discussed how different political, decisional, social, economic, technological, and environmental factors should be considered for a sustainable water reuse implementation, stating that a holistic approach is needed to evaluate GW reuse sustainability in a circular economy prospective. From a general overview, what emerges is that even though results are sometimes sitespecific -particularly in terms of net economic benefits -most studies showed that GW treatment with decentralised approaches are more beneficial than conventional treatments in terms of net energy consumption and economic costs. Finally, it is important to highlight that irrigation with raw GW can negatively affect soil hydraulic properties. In fact, GW-induced hydrophobicity resulted to be controlled by factors such as the nature of organic matter (i.e., biodegradability) and surface-active components that clog soil pores. GW-induced hydrophobicity of sand can be limited by using treated GW rather than raw GW (Maimon, et al., 2017). Therefore, treated GW should be preferred to direct reuse of untreated GW for irrigation purposes to maintain plant health.

        <p>Results from the reviewed GW treatment applications (constructed wetlands, green roofs, and green walls) suggest high removal performances, indicating the suitability of these systems in treating domestic GW. In particular, the reviewed data about green walls and green roofs showed that a high removal efficiency (~80%) in terms of organic matter can be obtained in systems with hydraulic loading rates up to 800 L/m²/day. Removal efficiency of total nitrogen was around 60-80% for HLR up to 500 L/m²/day, while removal of total phosphorus did not exhibit a correlation with HLR. Very high performances (often &gt;90%) were obtained for removal of total suspended solids for HLR up to 700 L/m²/day. The mentioned data provide a broad indication that values of HLR up to 500 L/m²/day can be employed in green walls and green roofs irrigated with greywater without reducing the removal efficiency for the parameters considered in this analysis. Further experimental studies to better constrain these sizing criteria are definitely warranted.Results from the reviewed GW treatment applications (constructed wetlands, green roofs, and green walls) suggest high removal performances, indicating the suitability of these systems in treating domestic GW.

        <p>The analysis of several Life Cycle Analysis studies performed in the last decades showed good results in terms of environmental and energetic benefits when integrated treatment systems using green structures are compared with traditional systems. Future efforts should be devolved to optimizing the treatment system and editing guidelines for the development of these systems. Finally, the implementation of trial systems has mostly been conducted for limited time periods (e.g., some months to 1-2 years) and the application of NBS for GW treatment needs hence to be further investigated in order to thoroughly understand the feasibility of these approaches over more realistic operating time (i.e., 15-20 years).

Finally, the implementation of trial systems has mostly been conducted for limited time periods (e.g., some months to 1-2 years) and the application of NBS for GW treatment needs hence to be further investigated in order to thoroughly understand the feasibility of these approaches over more realistic operating time (i.e., 15-20 years).
