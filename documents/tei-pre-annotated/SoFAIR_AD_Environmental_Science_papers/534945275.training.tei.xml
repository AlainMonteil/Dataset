        <p>Countries enact environmental regulations to achieve sustainable development and ecological sustainability. However, environmental regulations do not guarantee environmental sustainability unless implemented efficiently. Furthermore, political institutions play a key role in the formulation and management of environmental regulations. This research examines the relationship between democracy, environmental regulations, economic growth, and ecological footprint (EF) in the panel of G7 nations from 1985 to 2017. Second generation econometric techniques are used to analyze the data. The empirical evidence indicates that economic growth enhances EF while democracy and environmental regulations positively contribute to ecological sustainability by reducing EF. The causal outcomes reveal that democracy Granger causes EF and renewable energy indicating that democracy curbs environmental degradation and stimulates the share of renewables. Further, democracy and environmental regulations Granger cause each other. Lastly, the implication of these findings for sustainable development and ecological sustainability are discussed.</p>
        <p>are undergoing ecological deficits. Consequently, five of these highly developed nations are listed among the top 10 nations with the highest ecological footprints (Ewing et al., 2010). It is important to gauge the factors affecting the ecological sustainability of G7 since these countries are important players in global economic development, that is, an approximately 46% contribution to the world GDP comes from G7 countries (Ahmed, Asghar, et al., 2020). To tackle the environmental degradation issue, G7 nations have adopted environmental regulations and various measures to reduce fossil fuels. 1 Also, the educated public of these democratic nations often protests and demands a clean environment. Nevertheless, despite different commitments and pledges for a green environment, these nations have invested billions of dollars in fossil fuels rather than clean energy after the COVID-19 outbreak (Laville, 2021).</p>
        <p>This study evaluates the role of environmental regulations (ER) and democracy (DC) in the ecological footprint (EF) of G7 nations controlling economic growth (G), renewable energy (RN), and trade globalization (TG). Energy has a positive role in the development of nations; however, the combustion of fossil energy sources deteriorates environmental quality by expanding carbon and ecological footprints (Ahmed et al., 2019;Z. Wang et al., 2019). To mitigate the ecological damage, countries can opt for energy efficiency strategies that may help to decrease the consumption of energy; however, these strategies can benefit up to a limited extent. The ideal strategy to combat ecological degradation and climate change is to move towards alternative energy sources, such as renewables. These green energy sources, such as solar, wind, bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, and others can fuel economic growth and play an affirmative role in ecological sustainability (Farhani &amp; Shahbaz, 2014;Huang et al., 2021;Zafar et al., 2019). However, countries must design and implement comprehensive environmental regulations that could promote the transition towards green energy, and limit waste generation and resource consumption. Environmental regulations can be designed to accomplish several benefits, for example, stringent environmental regulations can help to increase energy efficiency, reduce the combustion of fossil energy sources (Danish et al., 2020;Shahzad, 2020), promote consumption and production of green energy, and deter potential negative environmental impacts of economic growth (Murshed et al., 2021). On the flipside, in the presence of relaxed environmental laws countries can become pollution havens and attract dirty technology and foreign investment in energy-intensive projects (Ahmed, Cary, &amp; Le, 2021;Sun et al., 2020). Relaxed environmental regulations also tend to promote pollution-intensive industries in the host country (Fotis &amp; Polemis, 2018;Zhao et al., 2020). In addition to this, in a globalized world with a high volume of international trade, countries with weak environmental laws ultimately end up importing more carbon compared to their trading partners with strong environmental laws (Murshed et al., 2021). Xiaoman et al. (2021) suggest that globalization reduces the ecological burden and promotes sustainable development in resource nations that possess stringent environmental laws.</p>
        <p>However, environmental regulations do not always reduce ecological degradation because the inefficient implementation of environmental regulations may overshadow their expected benefits.</p>
        <p>For example, the recent research of Omojolaibi and Nathaniel (2020) found that environmental regulations in the MENA countries are not efficient enough to decrease EF. Hence, it is reasonable to evaluate the role of environmental degradation in ecological footprint. It is pertinent to include democracy in the model since political institutions govern environmental policies. Previous studies believe that democratic accountability influences ecological sustainability due to several channels, for instance, the freedom of speech and free media are important elements in a democratic system that allows people to acquaint knowledge on diverse environmental issues (Payne, 1995). This ecological awareness along with freedom of speech can enable the general public to protest and pressurize the democratic government to enforce stringent environmental laws which may promote ecological sustainability (Farzin &amp; Bond, 2006). Apart from this, democratic systems are characterized by more public participation and improved accountability (Güngör et al., 2021), which can ensure the implementation of appropriate environmental laws, and reduce corruption. On the flipside, at a high development level, democracies may focus on securing economic objectives rather than ecological ones. Democracy is closely connected with economic development and an expansion in economic activities and more development leads to resource consumption and ecological degradation (Usman et al., 2019). Thus, in line with the verdicts of modernization theory, democracy may stimulate ecological degradation (Akalin &amp; Erdogan, 2020;Roberts &amp; Parks, 2008).</p>
        <p>The studies on democracy, environmental regulations, and EF nexus are scant and provide mixed evidence. For example, the study of Omojolaibi and Nathaniel (2020) disclosed that environmental regulations do not reduce EF in the MENA region, while the study of Murshed et al. (2021) noticed EF reduction in South Asia associated with environmental regulations. In the context of the EF-democracy nexus, Akalin and Erdogan (2020) proved that democracy stimulates EF in the OECD nations.</p>
        <p>Against this background, this study makes three-fold contribution to the literature. Firstly, it explores the relationship between democracy, environmental regulations, and EF for G7 countries in the presence of economic growth, renewable energy, and trade globalization. In addition to the long-run analysis, the causal associations among variables are determined for appropriate policy suggestions. The authors have not found any existing research on this nexus in the context of G7 countries. Secondly, the long-run methodology (CUP-FM and CUP-BC methods) adopted in this study generates consistent outcomes amidst cross-sectional dependence (CD), endogeneity, fractional integration, and autocorrelation. The study also utilized reliable cointegration (Westerlund, 2008) and causal methodologies (Dumitrescu &amp; Hurlin, 2012) that counter CD and other possible issues in the panel data. Thirdly, the study adopted the EF to proxy environmental deterioration. Undoubtedly, EF is the most holistic environmental indicator that captures anthropogenic pressure in terms of soil, water, and air (Ahmed &amp; Wang, 2019;Erdo gan et al., 2020;Kihombo et al., 2021). On the flipside, environmental indicators like CO 2 emissions and carbon footprint only capture the potential impact of energy consumption (Ahmad et al., 2021a). Hence, this study follows the recent literature and uses a suitable proxy for environmental deterioration to achieve reliable outcomes.</p>
        <p>In the previous literature, scholars have assessed the ecological impacts of environmental regulations (ER) from various perspectives.</p>
        <p>For instance, some scholars linked ER with CO 2 emissions in different panels and countries. For example, Danish et al. (2020) assessed the linkage between ER and CO 2 emissions in BRICS using the FMOLS technique. They disclosed that ER helps to reduce emissions and form an EKC between CO 2 and income. Using data from 30 Chinese provinces, Wenbo and Yan (2018) proved that Chinese environmental regulations effectively alleviate CO 2 emissions; however, the impact of ER on emissions is subject to regional variations. They also found an inverted U-shaped pattern between ER and emissions.</p>
        <p>In the Chinese context, Yang et al. (2018) disclosed that environmental regulations are connected with the relocation of firms to the region with weak ER. They also noticed that different measures for ER produce different results regarding the pollution haven hypothesis. Hashmi and Alam (2019) used Fixed and random effect models and GMM on the data of OECD nations and unfolded that ER decreases emissions level in the OECD. In contrast, H. Wang and Wei (2020) report that high innovation levels in the OECD countries can negatively impact environmental quality through the rebound effect, while stringent environmental regulations can hamper the economic development of emerging nations. In contrast, Pei et al. (2019) report that ER not only directly alleviate emissions level but also indirectly benefit the environment through technological efficiency. Conversely, Zhang et al. (2019) suggest that ER in China reduces pollution at the national level and in some regions. Furthermore, industrial amalgamation and ER develop a synergistic effect that affects pollution positively in some regions and also negatively in some regions. In another provincial study, Zhao et al. (2020) documented that ER reduces environmental deterioration and also affects environmental quality through influencing energy consumption in China.</p>
        <p>Proceeding to ER and ecological footprint nexus, Murshed et al. (2021) documented that ER decreases EF in the South Asian country directly and also indirectly through stimulating the negative effect of renewable energy on emissions. In contrast, Omojolaibi and Nathaniel (2020) revealed that energy and income deteriorate the environmental quality but ER does not affect environmental quality in the MENA region. Moreover, Shahzad (2020) conducted a comprehensive literature survey on environmental regulations and environmental pollution. He concluded the effect of ER on environmental pollution is still ambiguous and requires more detailed investigations.</p>
        <p>Besides, there are several studies that inspect the association between democracy and CO 2 emissions or local pollutants. Using the PMG method for nine nations, Güngör et al. (2021) illustrated that democracy (DC) alleviates CO 2 emissions, while energy usage boosts emissions. Using quantile regression in emerging nations, Lv (2017) concluded that democracy curbs emissions only when the income level of nations exceeds a threshold level. In contrast, Gill et al. (2019) suggested that DC delays the turning point of the EKC in the ASEAN and therefore, upsurges the ecological cost of economic growth. This contradicts the findings of Adams and Acheampong (2019) who found that renewable energy and DC both decrease emissions in African nations. Likewise, Murshed (2020) indicated that DC decreases deforestation and helps to form the EKC in the context of Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>In the context of the democracy (DC) and EF nexus, Akalin and Erdogan (2020) disclosed that DC lessens environmental quality by expanding the EF, whereas renewable energy increases environmental quality by decreasing EF in the OECD countries. DC also reduces deforestation that positively contributes to ecological quality (Murshed, 2020).</p>
        <p>Based on the above review of literature, it can be concluded that the effects of democracy (DC) and environmental regulations (ER) on environmental degradation are ambiguous. Moreover, the literature on the nexus of these variables with EF is inadequate. Therefore, this study evaluates how DC and ER influence EF in the panel of G7 nations.</p>
        <p>This paper studies the effects of environmental regulations (ER) and democracy (DC) on EF including renewable energy (RN), economic growth (G), and trade globalization (TG) in the model. EF is chosen as a proxy to depict ecological degradation because it is the most holistic environmental indicator that reveals anthropogenic impact in terms of water, soil, and air (Ahmed, Cary, &amp; Le, 2021). It is reasonable to use EF as a dependent variable since the alternative proxy for environmental degradation (CO 2 emissions) only tracks the impacts of energy consumption (Al-Mulali &amp; Ozturk, 2015). Economic growth (G) is a well-known contributor to ecological degradation because economic growth is connected with massive resource consumption (Ahmed &amp; Wang, 2019;Z. Wang et al., 2019), which stimulates EF. Generally, countries rely on fossil fuels to attain economic progress; however, renewable energy provides a worthwhile option to lower the negative ecological effects of economic growth. Renewable energy can also contribute to economic growth (Zafar et al., 2019) and alleviate EF levels (Nathaniel &amp; Khan, 2020). However, countries design and implement environmental regulations to increase energy efficiency, fossil fuel consumption (Shahzad, 2020), stimulate production and utilization of clean energy, and minimize the adverse impacts of economic growth Murshed et al. (2021). Environmental regulations can not only decrease EF directly but also can stimulate renewables which can also contribute to ecological quality (Fotis &amp; Polemis, 2018). However, the environmental policies of nations are decided and managed by political institutions. Democracy as an important institutional variable promotes freedom of speech and access to vital information due to freedom of media (Payne, 1995). Thus, availing the benefits of these features, the general public can enforce the government to enact stringent environmental laws leading to ecological sustainability (Farzin &amp; Bond, 2006). Finally, trade globalization can impact the environment negatively through the inflow of energy-intensive technology particularly in the presence of weak environmental regulations because during bilateral trade the country with relaxed environment laws ends up importing more environmental pollution (Murshed et al., 2021). Conversely, trade can also bring green technology by eliminating geographical boundaries and modern technology lowers ecological degradation (Ahmed &amp; Le, 2020). Considering these arguments, the study constructed the following model. 2020) is used to proxy democracy.</p>
        <p>This index ranges from 0 to 6 and more value of index means higher democratic accountability. Finally, the KOF index of Gygli et al. (2019) and Dreher (2006) is accessed to acquire data on the trade globalization index, which consists of de jure and de factor types of trade components. Thus, this index not only covers trade volume but also trade regulations and barriers, and so on. Economic growth's (per capita GDP) data came from the World Bank (WDI, 2021). Environmental regulations and economic growth for G7 countries are plotted in Figures 1 and2.</p>
        <p>This study relied on panel cointegration estimation techniques since our dataset for G7 countries has a long-time dimension and fewer cross-sections. Before examining the stationarity properties and longrun cointegration association among the variable, it is reasonable to explore the cross-sectional dependence (CD). In this globalized world, countries are interconnected through economic, social, and cultural networks. Thus, shock in one of the panel countries may spread to other economies which may affect the consistency of the estimator.</p>
        <p>where S indicates the cross-sectional averages. The CIPS test statistic is as follows:</p>
        <p>where CDF is the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF).</p>
        <p>After the stationarity diagnostics, we examine the cointegration between variables by utilizing the Westerlund (2007) panel cointegration test. This method has several advantages over the traditional cointegration tests and is well recognized in handling CD. The equation for this test is as follows.</p>
        <p>where W indicates the dependent variable, X represents the independent variable, i denotes the cross-sectional units, t represents the time, and d t includes the deterministic components. This approach provides four statistics two panel (Pt, Pa) and two group statistics (Gt, Ga).</p>
        <p>These four statistics allow heterogeneous specifications for long-run and short-run coefficients of the ECM model. Due to CD, 400 replication in bootstrapping are used to get the robust P-value. In addition, this study also employed Westerlund (2008) cointegration test. This test relies on the Durbin-Hausman principle and provides DH_group and DH_panel statistics. This method is more superior to the traditional cointegration test because it handles CD through common factors approach and allows stationary regressors in its estimation (Ahmed, Nathaniel, &amp; Shahbaz, 2021;Ulucak &amp; Bilgili, 2018).</p>
        <p>Afterward, this study used the continuously updated fully modified (CUP-FM) techniques to estimate the long-run relationship between underlying variables. The continuously updated bias-corrected (CUP-BC) approach is utilized to validate the findings of the CUP-FM. These methods are better than the traditional estimation measures like dynamic seemingly unrelated cointegrating regressions (DSUR), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). The DOLS and FMOLS are increasingly used to counter the issue of endogeneity and residual correlation in panel data analysis, but they have the limitation of not handling the CD. On the other hand, DSUR is used to handle the CD; however, it does not address the issue of endogeneity and serial correlation. Therefore, the present study relied on the CUP-FM and CUP-BC approaches of Bai et al. (2009) which are robust to endogeneity, serial correlation, and CD. The econometric specification for these methods is given below.</p>
        <p>After the long-run estimation, this study investigates the causal asso- panel granger causality test. This method is free from any restriction (i.e., restriction of T &gt; N) and provides efficient results in the presence of CD. The econometric specification of this test is given below.</p>
        <p>where β j j ð Þ represent parameters of autoregressive and j denotes the lag length.</p>
        <p>Before initiating the formal empirical analysis, this paper computed descriptive statistics of variables employed in the study. The variables are in the natural logarithm form. It can be noticed in Table 1 that the deviation of regressors from the average value (mean value) is minimum in most cases. In the next step, the study computed the correlation of variables. All variables are positively correlated with the EF except environmental regulations and trade globalization that are negatively correlated with EF. Also, correlation is not very high in any case (Table 2).</p>
        <p>In the next step, the study computed the variance inflation factors for the variables to check the issue of potential multicollinearity because multicollinearity can cause biased outcomes. The results presented in Table 3 reveal that VIF values for each variable are below 5; hence, there is no multicollinearity issue in our model.</p>
        <p>After doing these initial investigations, this paper checked the CD among selected variables. G7 nations are engaged in many agreements and they have a high volume of trade with each other. Hence, these nations are strongly interlinked. In (1) in both tests; however, the other variables show 1(0) and 1(1) integration levels in these tests.</p>
        <p>Next, the study applied cointegration tests to trace the long-run equilibrium relationship. For this purpose, first, the Westerlund (2007) test is applied that uses the bootstrap process and generates consistent results regarding cointegration in the model. The p-values produced by the bootstrap process in Table 6 indicate that one group (Gt) and one panel (Pt) test produce significant statistics. Hence, based on these results, the variables in our model are cointegrated.</p>
        <p>Even though this study found evidence of cointegration, to further substantiate this evidence, this research also adopted the Westerlund (2008) method. In addition to tackle CD, this method also allows stationary independent variables in the model. The findings in representing a positive linkage between EF and G. This coincides with the conclusions of Ahmed, Zafar, et al. (2020) in the context of G7 nations. Economic growth cannot be achieved without the production and consumption of goods and services. Hence, when the income level boosts, it raises resource consumption (such as energy, food, and water, etc.), land usage, and waste generation in the construction, transportation, industrial, residential, and other sectors. Consequently, the EF intensifies, and environmental deterioration increases. This conclusion is also substantiated by previous papers that estimated the linear linkage between EF and G (Ahmed, Asghar, et al., 2020;Rudolph &amp; Figge, 2017).</p>
        <p>The coefficient of RN (renewable energy) is negatively linked with the EF. A 0.048% reduction in EF can be achieved by a 1% increase in RN. This makes sense since many previous studies report that RN decreases EF and improves environmental quality, for instance, S. Nathaniel et al. (2020) for CIVETS nations, Nathaniel (2020) for Indonesia, Ahmed, Cary, and Le (2021) for the United States, and Ahmad et al. (2021a) for emerging nations. Energy consumption is obligatory to ensure uninterrupted growth; however, only clean energy sources, for instance, hydropower, wind, solar, tide, and geothermal can help to achieve sustainable growth. Thus, the consumption of such energy sources will not only stimulate ecological sustainability without hindering economic progress but also help nations to accomplish their environmental targets (Ahmad et al. 2021b).</p>
        <p>Similar to RN, the coefficient of environmental regulations (ER) is negative. Further, the significance of this coefficient unfolds that ER (environmental regulations) reduce EF in G7 nations, that is, a 0.247% reduction in EF can be achieved by a 1% increase in ER, ceteris paribus. This fresh estimate contradicts the empirical evidence of Hence, leading to more environmental sustainability measures, better environmental regulations, and less ecological footprint. Also, high public participation and improved accountability are important characteristics of democratic systems (Güngör et al., 2021), which can not only support the design and implementation of suitable strategies to reduce environmental degradation but also reduce the chances to favor some organizations or groups for personal benefits. Our findings are somewhat consistent with the studies that report mitigating impacts of democracy on emissions, for example, Güngör et al. (2021) for nine countries and Adams and Acheampong (2019) for African countries.</p>
        <p>Finally, trade globalization upsurges ecological pressure by increasing EF in G7 nations inferring that trade regulations and trade volume in the context of G7 countries do not support environmental sustainability. This opposes the estimates of Ahmed and Le (2020) for ASEAN. However, this estimate is somewhat in consonance with the results of Can et al. (2020) who indicate that different measures of trade stimulate environmental deterioration. This is an important finding in the context of G7 nations that are major players in international trade. These countries should opt for better trade regulations to support green technology inflow. Also, it would be better to focus on producing less energy-intensive products for export to the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>In the end, the study relied on the DH causality technique to probe causal directions. The estimates in develop environment-related technologies and increasing the share of clean energy. Thus, not all effects of trade are unfavorable to environmental quality.</p>
        <p>This research analyzes the impact of democracy (DC) and environmental regulations (ER) on EF in G7 countries including renewable energy (RN), economic growth (G), and trade globalization (TG) in the model.</p>
        <p>To do so, the study used panel data from 1985 to 2017 and applied CADF and CIPS unit root and Westerlund's (2007Westerlund's ( , 2008) ) Based on these findings, it can be concluded that G7 nations should strengthen their democratic system to reap ecological benefits. An increase in democratic accountability will also help to strengthen environmental regulations and increase renewable energy consumption.</p>
        <p>Thus, it would be better to further increase public participation in designing and implementing environmental regulations. Also, the accountability regarding the decision-making and allocation of investment for environmental purposes should further be improved. It would be beneficial to launch environmental awareness campaigns using the media to enhance the awareness of public regarding resource conservation and ecological sustainability. This will be helpful to use freedom of speech and information aspects of democracy for ecological sustainability.</p>
        <p>Despite various commitments, recently, G7 nations have invested billions in dirty fossil fuels; hence, there is a need for more stringent environmental regulations to avoid investment in fossil fuels. High taxes should be imposed on fossil energy and subsidies should be offered on renewables. Besides, the development of more environment-related green technologies will be helpful in switching towards green energy. In this regard, G7 should also take the benefit of international trade. The regulations for international trade should be revisited keeping in view the harmful effects of trade. Fossil fuel imports should be avoided by imposing strict regulations, and capabilities, technologies, and investment-related to green technologies must be boosted to avail benefits of trade globalization. These policies will be helpful for G7 to achieve sustainable growth since bidirectional causality between ER and economic growth exists implying that reduction in ER can obstruct economic growth.</p>
        <p>Thus, G7 should strengthen environmental regulations, increase renewables, and regulate international trade to deter negative effects of growth and attain sustainable development which in turn will lead towards environmental sustainability. This paper provides a deep understanding of the long-run effects of DC, ER, RN, and economic growth on EF and the mutual relationship among these variables.</p>
        <p>However, the possible relationship between democracy and environmental regulations is only assessed through causal analysis. Future studies can extend this work and add the interaction between democracy and ER, and ER and renewable energy to get interesting results.</p>
        <p>Likewise, future studies may examine this topic using city level and</p>
        <p>, the outcomes from Breusch-Pagan and Pesaran tests (LM and scaled LM) indicate strong evidence of CD in our panel dataset of G7 nations. After unfolding the evidence of CD, this study relied on CADF and CIPS methods for testing the stationarity. These tests developed by Pesaran (2007) can generate consistent outcomes amidst CD and therefore, are considered among the most reliable unit root tests. The outcomes in Table 5 indicate that EF, TRG, and DC are integrated at 1</p>
        <p>disclose that the group (DHg) and panel (DHp) statistics are significant at 5% and 10% significance levels. Thus, this test also validates the earlier findings of cointegration in the model.</p>
        <p>These findings enabled us to use the CUP-FM method to scrutinize the long-run impacts of the selected independent variables on environmental quality. The long-run elasticities are presented in Table</p>

On the flipside, better environmental regulations improve the image of the democratic system because the educated public of G7 demand stringent environmental regulations from their elected representatives. Besides, trade globalization also Granger cause RN and ER indicating that TG is helpful to T A B L E 8 Long-run estimations T A B L E 9</p>
