        <p>Background: WHO has published several volumes of Global Air Quality Guidelines to provide guidance on the health risks associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution. As new scientific evidence is generated, air quality guidelines need to be periodically revised and, where necessary, updated. Objectives: The aims of the study were 1) to summarise the available evidence on the effect of long-term exposure to ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) on mortality; 2) and to assess concentration response functions (CRF), their shape and the minimum level of exposures measured in studies to support WHO's update of the global air quality guidelines. Data sources: We conducted a systematic literature search of the Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases following a protocol proposed by WHO and applied Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting our results. Study eligibility criteria: Cohort studies in human populations (including sub-groups at risk) exposed to longterm concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 . Outcomes assessed were all-cause, respiratory, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Acute Lower Respiratory Infection (ALRI) mortality.Background: WHO has published several volumes of Global Air Quality Guidelines to provide guidance on the health risks associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution.

        <p>Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies included in the meta-analyses were assessed using a new Risk of Bias instrument developed by a group of experts convened by WHO. Study results are presented in forest plots and quantitative meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models. The certainty of evidence was assessed using a newly developed adaptation of GRADE. Results: The review identified 2068 studies of which 95 were subject to full-text review with 45 meeting the inclusion criteria. An update in September 2018 identified 159 studies with 1 meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 46 included studies, 41 reported results for NO 2 and 20 for O 3 . The majority of studies were from the USA and Europe with the remainder from Canada, China and Japan. Forty-two studies reported results for all-cause mortality and 22 for respiratory mortality.Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies included in the meta-analyses were assessed using a new Risk of Bias instrument developed by a group of experts convened by WHO.

        <p>Outdoor air pollution has been a global concern for decades, partially due to economic growth and urbanisation. Air pollution has been recognised as a major environmental hazard to human health and a cause of mortality and morbidity (Burnett et al., 2018;World Health Organization, 2012). Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a toxic gas with both outdoor (e.g. traffic) and indoor (e.g. gas cooking) sources. In outdoor urban environments, NO 2 is derived primarily from the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) a primary traffic pollutant. Ozone (O 3 ) is a highly reactive oxidative gas formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds and driven by solar radiation. In urban areas with high traffic density, nitrogen oxides (NO and NO 2 ) are commonly high and often negatively correlated with O 3 during daylight hours. Evidence suggested that NO 2 and O 3 both detrimentally affect people's health, including respiratory function, hospital admission, and premature death (Nuvolone et al., 2018;Strickland et al., 2010;Malig et al., 2016;Urman et al., 2014).Outdoor air pollution has been a global concern for decades, partially due to economic growth and urbanisation.

        <p>WHO has previously published Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) to provide guidance to the public and to policy and other decision makers on the health risks associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution (WHO, 2000;WHO, 2005). As new scientific evidence is generated, air quality guidelines need to be periodically revised and, where necessary, updated. The update of the WHO AQGs is a global project coordinated by the WHO Regional Office for Europe's European Centre for Environment and Health (ECEH) in Bonn (Germany), including participation from all WHO Regions and WHO headquarters. In support of this update, systematic reviews of both short-and long-term studies on air pollutants and mortality and morbidity are necessary.WHO has previously published Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) to provide guidance to the public and to policy and other decision makers on the health risks associated with exposure to outdoor air pollution (WHO, 2000;WHO, 2005).

        <p>This review focuses upon long-term concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 and all-cause and respiratory mortality studied in epidemiological cohort studies. Previous reviews of NO 2 (Atkinson et al., 2018;Faustini et al., 2014;Hoek et al., 2013;EPA, 2016;WHO, 2013) and O 3 (WHO, 2013;Atkinson et al., 2016;EPA US, 2013) have been undertaken. However, in order to ensure guideline revisions are informed by the latest evidence, a new review was undertaken with formal evaluation of Risk of Bias (RoB) and certainty of evidence (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)). For the reviews new adaptations of the RoB and GRADE assessments were developed.This review focuses upon long-term concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 and all-cause and respiratory mortality studied in epidemiological cohort studies.

        <p>The aims of the study were 1) to conduct an extensive systematic review and meta-analysis on associations between long-term concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 on mortality; and 2) to assess concentration response functions, their shape and the minimum level of exposures measured in studies. The following framework (Appendix Table B1) was used to select the critical health outcome(s) for each pollutant: 1) Evidence on causality for a health outcome based upon the latest determination (causal or likely causal) from US EPA, IARC, Health Canada or other integrated science assessments available; 2) Using the precautionary principle, additional most severe health outcomes other than causal or likely causal (e.g. suggestive causality) were considered for inclusion taking into account contribution to burden of disease (prevalence of disease, disability weight, etc), policy implications, expected increase in exposure to a pollutant in the future, etc.; 3) causality determination superseded severity of a health outcome but, in some cases, two (or more) different health outcomes may be systematically evaluated for the same pollutant (e.g. one with a definite or likely causal link to the pollutant, and another health outcome for which the evidence is suggestive but which is very severe or prevalent in the population). Severity of disease was informed by considerations proposed by the joint European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society latest policy statement on health effects from air pollution (fatality, persistence of effect, susceptible groups, and medical/functional significance including loss of autonomy and reduced quality of life) (Thurston et al., 2017).The aims of the study were 1) to conduct an extensive systematic review and meta-analysis on associations between long-term concentrations of NO 2 and O 3 on mortality; and 2) to assess concentration response functions, their shape and the minimum level of exposures measured in studies.

        <p>Risk estimates extracted from cohort studies were hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs in the units reported in the original studies. For the purpose of this review HRs were considered to be equivalent to relative risks (RR). Where risk estimates were reported in parts per billion (ppb), standard factors were used to convert ppb to μg/m 3 ; for NO 2 and O 3 these were 1.88 and 1.96 respectively (Air Information Resource, 2005). RRs (and 95% CIs) were scaled to 10 μg/m 3 increments by taking the natural logarithm of the risk estimates (and confidence limits) and then standardising to 10 μg/m 3 by dividing by the original risk increment and multiplying by 10. Standardisation to a common metric is required to enable risk estimates to be combined in a metaanalysis.Risk estimates extracted from cohort studies were hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs in the units reported in the original studies.

        <p>A new RoB tool was developed by a working group convened by WHO for the assessment of cohort studies in air pollution epidemiology (https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/air-quality/publications/2020/risk-of-bias-assessmentinstrument-for-systematic-reviews-informing-who-global-air-qualityguidelines-2020). The tool consisted of six domains: confounding, selection bias, exposure assessment, outcome assessment, missing data and selective reporting, each including one to four subdomains. In total, 13 sub-domains (Morgan et al., 2019) were each rated as low, moderate or high risk of bias. If any one sub-domain was rated medium or high RoB then the domain was rated similarly. RoB was applied to each pollutant-outcome pair for studies included in a meta-analysis. Assessment of RoB for the confounding sub-domain "Were all confounders considered adjusted for in the analysis?" was based upon the inclusion in the analysis of critical and potential confounders according to the outcome. For all-cause mortality critical confounders were: age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and an indicator (individual or area) for socio-Fig. 1.

        <p>The GRADE instrument is comprised of eight domains. In each domain the starting level of certainty in the evidence was 'moderate'. In five domains: limitations in studies; indirectness; inconsistency; imprecision; and publication bias the certainty of evidence could be downgraded following assessment of the evidence. In three domains: large effect size; plausible confounding towards null; and dose-response relationship the certainty in the evidence could be upgraded. The overall certainty assessment of the body of evidence was then determined by adding together the downgrades and upgrades across domains. An overall rating of high meaning that further research is very unlikely to change the confidence in the estimate of the effect; moderate that further research is likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the estimate of the effect; low, that further research is very likely to have an important impact on the confidence in the estimate of the effect; or very low, meaning that the estimate of the effect is very uncertain. Some domains of this tool were evaluated using results of the RoB, heterogeneity, sensitivity, and publication bias analyses, which were previously described in the methodology.The GRADE instrument is comprised of eight domains.

        <p>A brief outline of each domain is given below: Domain 1, limitation in studies, incorporated assessment of RoB, with certainty of evidence downgraded only if meta-analysis of studies of low RoB differed from meta-analysis of all studies. Hence, the presence of small studies with high RoB but limited influence on the metaanalysis was not a reason to downgrade. Domain 2, indirectness, related to how well the PECO in the studies in the meta-analysis reflected the original PECO; Domain 3, inconsistency domain, addressed heterogeneity using an 80% prediction interval. The evidence certainty was downgraded if substantial heterogeneity was present as indicated by the 80% PI including 1 and twice the width of the 95% CI; Domain 4, imprecision, was evaluated using sample size calculations rather than the confidence interval for the pooled estimate since in environmental health there are no clinical decision thresholds involved; Domain 5, small study bias, assessment was based upon a funnel plot and Eggers test used to assess funnel plot asymmetry. The evidence certainty was downgraded only if there was clear indication of bias/ asymmetry; Domain 6, effect size. Potential upgrades to certainty of evidence related to effect size was assessed using the E-value calculated with increments of 40 μg/m 3 and 30 μg/m 3 for NO 2 and O 3 respectively. (VanderWeele and Ding, 2017) E-values were not calculated when the summary RR was below 1; Abbreviation: BMI -body mass index; SES -socio-economic status; NR -not reported.A brief outline of each domain is given below: Domain 1, limitation in studies, incorporated assessment of RoB, with certainty of evidence downgraded only if meta-analysis of studies of low RoB differed from meta-analysis of all studies.

A number of cohorts were analysed more than once hence reducing the number of independent estimates available for meta-analyses.

Combining studies using annual and peak O 3 metrics was not considered appropriate because the lowest O 3 concentrations are unlikely to occur during 'peak' O 3 months; and secondly correlations between O 3 and other pollutants are known to vary by 'season'.The review identified 20 articles reporting results for O 3 and mortality.

This random effect model assumes a distribution of true population associations; that is the magnitude of the association between pollutant and mortality in one study population is different to another study population. However, as NO 2 and O 3 are gases, and therefore the same compositions in all study locations, it could be argued that a random effects model is not appropriate. The variation between the observed associations may arise because of differences between study characteristics (e.g. study population, adjustment for confounders, spatial resolution of the pollution models, co-pollutants or analytical methods employed) and should be (mostly) explainable using metaregression techniques provided the appropriate data and sufficient numbers of studies are available.

        <p>Only a small number of studies investigated the shape of the concentration-response function. In general, these studies found limited evidence to reject the assumption of linearity. A statistically significant linear regression coefficient (log-scale) is indicative of an important concentration response function but does not inform of the actual shape of the relationship, the existence of a threshold or whether the association is present for a given pollutant concentration range. The majority of included studies did not indicate whether the shape of the relationship was investigated prior to fitting a linear model. The minimum or 5th percentile values of the distributions of the pollutant concentrations provide an indication of the lower concentrations included in the set of observations to which a linear model was fitted. This is not the same as saying the concentration-response relationship is linear down to these concentrations. A linear model will fit a linear relationship between two variables irrespective of whether not the exposure variable and the outcome are linearly related. Furthermore, data are often sparse at the extremes of the pollutant distributions and therefore the corresponding prediction intervals wide. Caution is therefore required when interpreting the results from linear models in relation to the range of observed concentrations.Only a small number of studies investigated the shape of the concentration-response function.

        <p>Even for studies that only reported results from linear models, the distribution of the pollutant concentrations is not always reported. In such cases authors were contacted by email and asked to provide the relevant data with variable response. Hence, in a sizeable proportion of the studies, the 5th percentile/minimum pollutant concentrations are missing. Moreover, studies from geographical regions with high levels of pollutants comprised a small proportion in our review, but with vast majority of studies from countries with low-middle range of pollutant concentration. These gaps make interpretation of the evidence more difficult. Given the importance of both the shape of the concentration response function and the range of observed concentrations to the achievement of the review objective, a strategy for evidential judgement is required. For example, should guideline recommendations be based upon only those studies with complete data and have specifically set out to evaluate the shape of the concentration response function?Even for studies that only reported results from linear models, the distribution of the pollutant concentrations is not always reported.

        <p>Assessment of the impact of co-pollutants on the associations between NO 2 and O 3 and mortality was limited by the small number of studies reporting results from two-pollutant models and the high correlation between pollutants in some studies. The difficulties in interpreting coefficients in multi-pollutant models are well recognised (Greenbaum and Shaikh, 2010;Dominici et al., 2010) and include high correlation between pollutants (limiting the ability of two-pollutant models to separate out associations) leading to unstable parameter estimation; differential measurement error between pollutants which can lead to the 'transfer' of an association from the less well measured (but true) pollutant to the better measured (but incorrect) pollutant; and finally analysts rarely assess interactions between pollutants which is necessary to interpret correctly model main effects. Some investigators have proposed methods for dealing with correlated predictors, for example composite hazard ratios for more than one pollutant. An assessment of results from multi-pollutant models should consider changes in risk estimates from single and multi-pollutant pollutants for each pollutant jointly, not individually (Dominici et al., 2010). The relatively small numbers of studies reporting results from multi-pollutant models limits out assessment of these issues. Caution should be exercised therefore when interpreting results from single pollutant models as reported associations may reflect pollutant mixtures rather than individual pollutants per se.Assessment of the impact of co-pollutants on the associations between NO 2 and O 3 and mortality was limited by the small number of studies reporting results from two-pollutant models and the high correlation between pollutants in some studies.

        <p>Hazard ratios from cohort studies are typically small. The choice of studies for meta-analyses can have a relatively large impact on the summary HRs. Because of the ubiquitous nature of exposure to outdoor air pollution, small HRs derived from reviews of this kind, can have a substantial estimated health impact because of the large populations exposed. The review protocol including decisions on study selection relating to confounder adjustment, patient vs general population cohorts, spatial resolution of the air pollution models will have a major bearing on the included studies, the meta-analytical estimates and consequently health impact assessments. For these reasons the prediction intervals provide useful and important information regarding the range of the risk estimates in the studied populations.Hazard ratios from cohort studies are typically small.

        <p>The RoB tool was discriminatory for a small number of studies in the confounding domain only and all but a very few studies were rated low for other domains. One possible explanation for this lack of discrimination is that the included studies are of a high quality and at low risk of bias. Another is that the RoB tool is not sensitive enough to assess the risk of potential biases in the literature. For example, the bias assessment in the confounding domain relied upon the inclusion/exclusion of a set of critical and potential confounders in the studies. The list of potential confounders was long and lead to most studies being rated as moderate risk of bias. The RoB tool used in this review was recently developed for environmental epidemiology, therefore we cannot rule out the potential misapplication of the new tool at this stage. However, the new RoB tool does provide a framework to assess bias in the included literature systematically. Future development of the tool could further improve its capacity to recognise the flaws in study design and report which potentially attenuate the effect observed.The RoB tool was discriminatory for a small number of studies in the confounding domain only and all but a very few studies were rated low for other domains.

        <p>There remains no widely accepted GRADE-like system to assess evidence in observational studies in environmental health. The adapted GRADE framework used in this review was less strict than the standard GRADE. The modified framework, which was developed by methodologists and experts in environmental epidemiology, is a step towards achieving a robust set of criteria for evidence evaluation. However, it is not without its difficulties. The development of the tool was a lengthy process with differences between group members relating to the detail and application of the tool. The use of the E-value (VanderWeele and Ding, 2017), derived from the summary risk ratio in a meta-analysis, to assess the size of associations reported in cohort studies remains problematical because some cohorts control for most critical and potential confounders. Determining a potential unmeasured confounder is therefore not straightforward, nor is finding the relevant literature with which to assess the degree of potential confounding. Furthermore, the E-value is not without its critics (Ioannidis et al., 2019). Another challenging aspect of the tool is the assessment of small study bias in the presence of heterogeneity (Peters et al., 2010). In this respect we have been circumspect in the application of this specific GRADE criterion, interpreting both the funnel plot and the result of the Eggers test with caution. The criterion that the 80% prediction interval is twice the confidence interval and contains unity was also new. Where the body of evidence is heterogeneous and a wide range in the magnitude of associations is observed, this criterion downgrades the certainty of evidence on the basis that there may exist one (or more) populations in which an adverse association is not found. There may well be positive associations in other populations however. During the development of the tool there was discussion on whether this rule should be strictly applied or whether a more flexible application was appropriate. We therefore applied downgrading in this domain only when the 80% PI contained unity and did not downgrade when the ratio was marginal (the CI are approximately symmetrical about the point estimate on the relative risk scale when the risks are small). Exclusion of the few, high RoB studies did not lead to major changes in the summary risk ratios and hence did not indicate a downgrade for the domain, though this is perhaps not surprising given the small risks reported in many air pollution cohort studies and the relative imprecision of some studies.There remains no widely accepted GRADE-like system to assess evidence in observational studies in environmental health.

        <p>The main value of the system is that the comparability of the judgements increases when all assessors consider the same arguments underpinning their certainty in a similar manner. That is how the factors for downgrading and upgrading the certainty have been developed: to guide expert judgement. Behind each down-and upgrading factor in GRADE, there is a rationale for its importance and guidance for elaborating good reasons for downgrading or not downgrading. These ideas are well explained in the GRADE Handbook (Schunemann et al., 2013). Most of the reasoning in this framework can be equally well used for observational studies of exposure as for randomized studies of interventions (Morgan et al., 2016). However, at some points there is a need for elaboration or clarification on how to use the GRADE criteria for observational studies of exposure.The main value of the system is that the comparability of the judgements increases when all assessors consider the same arguments underpinning their certainty in a similar manner.

        <p>Although different groups have adapted the approach for environmental exposures in recent years, no consensus has emerged among experts yet. Unlike some previous efforts, the aim of this work is not assessing the strength of evidence for causal inference by considering all the relevant streams of research (Woodruff and Sutton, 2011), but to rate how certain one is that the 'true' estimate of the epidemiological association between an air pollutant and an adverse health effect lies within a particular range (Hultcrantz et al., 2017). Consistent with the standard GRADE framework, the certainty of the effect estimate is graded as high, moderate, low or very low. The ratings are subsequently used to select and underpin concentration -response functions in the process of deriving guideline exposure levels.Although different groups have adapted the approach for environmental exposures in recent years, no consensus has emerged among experts yet.

        <p>The current approach was designed specifically to assess the certainty of the evidence from the systematic reviews commissioned by WHO to inform the update of global air quality guidelines (AQGs). Its development benefitted from previous experiences in applying GRADE in the field of occupational and environmental health, as well as specific expertise in air pollution epidemiology. The approach was extensively discussed in two Guideline Development Group meetings, pilot tested by the members of the Systematic Review Team and improved iteratively according to the feedback received.The current approach was designed specifically to assess the certainty of the evidence from the systematic reviews commissioned by WHO to inform the update of global air quality guidelines (AQGs).

        <p>The assessors should consider the extent to which the Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome(s), Study Design (PECOS) of the studies in the meta-analysis reflects the original PECOS question formulated at the beginning of the systematic review process (Guyatt et al., 2011).The assessors should consider the extent to which the Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome(s), Study Design (PECOS) of the studies in the meta-analysis reflects the original PECOS question formulated at the beginning of the systematic review process (Guyatt et al., 2011).</p>

        <p>Usually there is more heterogeneity in observational than in experimental studies, because more factors can influence the effect size. Therefore, it is important to try to explain the heterogeneity. The first step should be to consider the factors that are listed for subgroup analyses in the protocol, as those that are most likely to be moderators of effect sizes. Another source of heterogeneity can be variation in risk of bias. This may explain part of the heterogeneity, and evaluation of only studies at low risk of bias should then decrease the heterogeneity. The difference in effect sizes between the subgroups should be tested for statistical significance. A rule of thumb to be used is to check if the confidence intervals of the subgroup pooled effect sizes do not overlap.Usually there is more heterogeneity in observational than in experimental studies, because more factors can influence the effect size.

        <p>Ideally, a meta-regression should be conducted including all moderators of the effect size, to find out how much heterogeneity remains after allowing for previously established reasons for heterogeneity. In practice, it is unlikely that all studies in a systematic review will have the necessary information to do a complete meta-regression including all previously documented reasons for heterogeneity. This could then be done on subsets of studies having the relevant information.Ideally, a meta-regression should be conducted including all moderators of the effect size, to find out how much heterogeneity remains after allowing for previously established reasons for heterogeneity.

        <p>Heterogeneity is often measured with the I 2 statistic which varies between 0 and 100%, where 0% would indicate no heterogeneity and 100% large heterogeneity. Because the I 2 statistic is a relative measure, it is difficult to make a judgement about the absolute amount of heterogeneity. As a result, the use of the prediction interval has been suggested (IntHout et al., 2016;Borenstein, 2019).Heterogeneity is often measured with the I 2 statistic which varies between 0 and 100%, where 0% would indicate no heterogeneity and 100% large heterogeneity.

        <p>The prediction interval provides an estimate of the distribution of the true effect sizes. To prevent overstating heterogeneity in observational studies, an 80% interval, and not the usual 95% interval, was chosen. For an 80% prediction interval, the true effect size for 80% of all populations would fall in this interval. This tells if the effect is consistent or if it varies substantially. It also tells if the effect is harmful in all populations, or if there is no effect in some populations or maybe even a preventive effect.The prediction interval provides an estimate of the distribution of the true effect sizes.

        <p>If the 80% prediction interval for a specific meta-analysis of relative risks is of the same size as the confidence interval, this indicates that there is no more variation in effect sizes than the statistical uncertainty.

        <p>However, if the prediction interval is considerably wider than the confidence interval (e.g., double the size) and overlaps with 1, there is reason for concern about heterogeneity.

For example, an alternative conclusion could be that there would be no risk.

        <p>The cut-offs for downgrading because of imprecision given by the standard GRADE approach are applicable to clinical decision-making.

        <p>Therefore, the proposed approach consists of calculating the number of participants needed for a single study that can measure the relative risk of interest with sufficient precision (Rothman and Greenland, 2018). If the number of participants in the meta-analysis is considerably lower than the number that would be needed for an adequately powered study, the certainty of the evidence is rated down. This is a relatively conservative approach, and implies that the information size of the meta-analysis would need to be larger than the single study because heterogeneity has to be taken into account.Therefore, the proposed approach consists of calculating the number of participants needed for a single study that can measure the relative risk of interest with sufficient precision (Rothman and Greenland, 2018).

        <p>A method of calculating the sample size needed for a study with a specific relative risk and confidence interval was recently proposed by Rothman and Greenland (Ostro et al., 2010). As guidance, the calculation of the sample size needed to be able to assess a relative risk for mortality of 1.05 per 10 μg/m 3 increase of PM 2.5 with a confidence interval with a width of 0.09 (1.01-1.10) is provided below.A method of calculating the sample size needed for a study with a specific relative risk and confidence interval was recently proposed by Rothman and Greenland (Ostro et al., 2010).

        <p>The event rate in the example above was observed over a five-year follow-up period in a cohort of female public school teachers aged around 54 years on average at baseline. As the confidence interval of the relative risk depends also and strongly on the event rate, the calculated number of about 940,000 person years should be viewed as indicative. It could be considerably smaller in older populations with higher event rates, and considerably larger in populations with lower event rates.The event rate in the example above was observed over a five-year follow-up period in a cohort of female public school teachers aged around 54 years on average at baseline.

        <p>Publication bias is assessed by a funnel plot and Egger's test. If the funnel plot upon visual inspection shows that small studies with non-harmful effects are missing, this would be an indication of publication bias. This means that small (imprecise) studies that have a relative risk smaller than 1 are missing. If there is no indication for these missing studies in the funnel plot, there is no use for the Egger's test, because significance will result from other factors causing heterogeneity (Borenstein, 2019). The Egger's test would just be used to confirm suspected publication bias detected from the funnel plot.Publication bias is assessed by a funnel plot and Egger's test.

        <p>The standard GRADE approach proposes upgrading the certainty of the evidence in observational studies if the pooled effect size is large or very large, so that 'the study design that is more prone to bias is unlikely to explain all of the apparent benefit or harm'. The cut-off point for a large effect size for harm is a relative risk &gt; 2, while for a very large effect size is a relative risk &gt; 5. These numbers are somehow arbitrary, and are not in the order of magnitude of the many relative risks reported in environmental health.The standard GRADE approach proposes upgrading the certainty of the evidence in observational studies if the pooled effect size is large or very large, so that 'the study design that is more prone to bias is unlikely to explain all of the apparent benefit or harm'.

        <p>Instead of taking a certain value of the relative risk as the cut-off point, it is reasonable to judge whether confounding could have easily influenced the pooled effect size found in the meta-analysis. To this end, the application of the E-value approach is helpful (VanderWeele and Ding, 2017;Haneuse et al., 2019;Ioannidis et al., 2019;VanderWeele et al., 2019). This statistic is based on an assessment of how easily unmeasured confounders could explain away the relationship found between the exposure and the health outcome. It is based on the mathematical calculation of how large the effect of a confounder should be to explain away the relative risk that has been found in a study. With 'explain away', it is meant that such a confounder would reduce the relative risk that resulted from the observations in the study to 1. This effect (or E-value) is a function of the relative risk that has been found in a study or in a meta-analysis and is calculated as follows: E-value = RR + sqrt {RR * (RR -1)}. The idea behind it is very similar to the 'large effect' concept in the standard GRADE framework but does not use absolute cut-offs for large effect sizes.Instead of taking a certain value of the relative risk as the cut-off point, it is reasonable to judge whether confounding could have easily influenced the pooled effect size found in the meta-analysis.

        <p>The judgement is then to ascertain if an unmeasured confounder could easily have an association with the exposure and the outcome with relative risks as large as or larger than the E-value. It is important to note that this is always the covariate-adjusted association between the unmeasured confounder and the outcome, and also the covariate-adjusted association between the unmeasured confounder and exposure to air pollution. If such a confounder could realistically have such strong relationships with both exposure and outcome, then unmeasured confounding could explain away the observed pooled relative risk. If one judges that it would be very unlikely that an unmeasured confounder would attain a relative risk as high as the E-value, then one can conclude that unmeasured confounding is unlikely to explain away the relative risk that has been observed. In that case, the certainty of the evidence can be upgraded because of a large effect size.The judgement is then to ascertain if an unmeasured confounder could easily have an association with the exposure and the outcome with relative risks as large as or larger than the E-value.

        <p>It is important to note that a major part of the judgement is what a realistic value for the relative risk of the unmeasured confounder could possibly be. Preferably, this should be based on what is known about strong confounders for the association at hand. For the association air pollution-mortality, smoking would be an obvious choice about which much information is available concerning its relationship with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. However, the residual association between smoking and air pollution is highly variable across published studies, and calculations of E-values should report the covariate-adjusted associations with both air pollution and the outcome. The same logic applies to shortterm studies where the covariate-adjusted associations between the confounder and the exposure (and the confounder-outcome) is relevant.It is important to note that a major part of the judgement is what a realistic value for the relative risk of the unmeasured confounder could possibly be.
