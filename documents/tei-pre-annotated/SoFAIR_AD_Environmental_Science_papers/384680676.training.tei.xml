        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost every country in the world since it started in China in late 2019. Controlling the pandemic requires a multifaceted approach including whole genome sequencing to support public health interventions at local and national levels. One of the most widely used methods for sequencing is the ARTIC protocol, a tiling PCR approach followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing (ONT) of up to 96 samples at a time. There is a need, however, for a flexible, platform agnostic, method that can provide multiple throughput options depending on changing requirements as the pandemic peaks and troughs. Here we present CoronaHiT, a method capable of multiplexing up to 96 small genomes on a single MinION flowcell or &gt;384 genomes on Illumina NextSeq, using transposase mediated addition of adapters and PCR based addition of barcodes to ARTIC PCR products. We demonstrate the method by sequencing 95 and 59 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for routine and rapid outbreak response runs, respectively, on Nanopore and Illumina platforms and compare to the standard ARTIC LoCost nanopore method. Of the 154 samples sequenced using the three approaches, genomes with ≥ 90% coverage (GISAID criteria) were generated for 64.3% of samples for ARTIC LoCost, 71.4% for CoronaHiT-ONT, and 76.6% for CoronaHiT-Illumina and have almost identical clustering on a maximum likelihood tree. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can multiplex up to 96 SARS-CoV-2 genomes per MinION flowcell and that Illumina sequencing can be performed on the same libraries, which will allow significantly higher throughput. CoronaHiT provides increased coverage for higher Ct samples, thereby increasing the number of high qualityThe COVID-19 pandemic has spread to almost every country in the world since it started in China in late 2019.

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus began late 2019 in Wuhan, China and has now spread to virtually every country in the world, with tens of millions of confirmed cases and millions of deaths (Dong, Du, and Gardner 2020). Key to the control of the pandemic is understanding the epidemiological spread of the virus at global, national and local scales (Shu and McCauley 2017). Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be the fastest and most accurate method to study virus epidemiology as it spreads.

        <p>Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, a network of academic and public health institutions across the UK brought together to collect, sequence and analyse whole genomes to fully understand the transmission and evolution of this virus (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was first sequenced in China using a metatranscriptomic approach (Wu et al. 2020). This facilitated the design of tiling PCR approaches for genome sequencing, the most widely used of which is the ARTIC Network (https://artic.network) protocol. Consensus genome sequences are typically made publicly available on GISAID (Elbe and Buckland Merrett 2017). This has enabled real-time public health surveillance of the spread and evolution of the pandemic through interactive tools such as 
            <rs type="software">NextStrain</rs> (Hadfield et al. 2018). The ARTIC network protocol was designed for nanopore technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), enabling rapid genome sequencing for outbreak response. The method was originally capable of testing only 23 samples plus a negative control on a flowcell, however, with the recent release of the Native Barcoding Expansion 96 kit by ONT, 11-95 samples plus a negative control can be sequenced on a flowcell using the ARTIC LoCost V3 method (Quick, 2020). A platform agnostic method is required to provide flexible throughput on Illumina or nanopore that allows low-cost sequencing of 10s to 100s of viral genomes depending on (1) changing requirements as the pandemic peaks and troughs and (2) the turnaround time required e.g. routine weekly vs rapid outbreak sequencing. Here we describe a flexible protocol, Coronavirus High Throughput (CoronaHiT), which allows for up to 95 samples, plus a negative control to be multiplexed on a single MinION flowcell or alternatively, by switching barcodes, over 384 samples on Illumina. We demonstrate CoronaHiT's performance on 95 and 59 SARS-CoV-2 genomes on MinION and Illumina NextSeq for routine and rapid outbreak response runs, respectively, and compare to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. The lower of the cycle thresholds (Ct) produced by the two SARS-CoV-2 assays in the Roche, AusDiagnostics, Altona Diagnostics and CDC assays were used to determine whether samples required dilution before sequencing according to the ARTIC protocol.

        <p>Libraries were prepared using a novel modified Illumina DNA prep tagmentation approach (formerly called Nextera DNA Flex Illumina Library Prep) (Rowan et al. 2019;Beier et al. 2017). Primers with a 3' end compatible with the Nextera transposon insert and a 24bp barcode at the 5' end with a 7 bp spacer were used to PCR barcode the tagmented ARTIC PCR products. The barcode sequences are from the PCR Barcoding Expansion 1-96 kit (EXP-PBC096, Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Symmetrical dual barcoding was used, i.e. the same barcode added at each end of the PCR product and up to 96 samples could be run together using this approach or 95 if a negative control is included (Supplementary Table 4).Libraries were prepared using a novel modified Illumina DNA prep tagmentation approach (formerly called Nextera DNA Flex Illumina Library Prep) (Rowan et al. 2019;Beier et al. 2017).

        <p>The COG-UK consortium defined a consensus sequence as passing COG-UK quality control if greater than 50% of the genome was covered by confident calls or there was at least 1 contiguous sequence of more than 10,000 bases and with no evidence of contamination. This is regarded as the minimum amount of data to be phylogenetically useful. A confident call was defined as having a minimum of 10X depth of coverage for Illumina data and 20X depth of coverage for Nanopore data. If the coverage fell below these thresholds, the bases were masked with Ns. Low quality variants were also masked with Ns.

        <p>A novel library preparation method, CoronaHiT, was developed for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing, which combines a cheap transposase-based introduction of adapters (Illumina Nextera) with symmetric PCR barcoding of up to 96 samples (or 95 samples with a negative control) on a MinION. Alternatively, if higher throughput is needed, the barcodes can be switched for Illumina sequencing. For ONT sequencing, Nextera adapter complementary primer sequences were added to ONT PCR barcodes and used to barcode ARTIC PCR products (Figure 1) as described in the methods. For Illumina sequencing, the method is a streamlined and cheaper version of standard Illumina library preparations.A novel library preparation method, CoronaHiT, was developed for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing, which combines a cheap transposase-based introduction of adapters (Illumina Nextera) with symmetric PCR barcoding of up to 96 samples (or 95 samples with a negative control) on a MinION.

        <p>For the routine samples, 30 hours of sequencing data was used for both CoronaHiT-ONT and ARTIC LoCost, and for the rapid response set, 18 hours was used; the full dataset was used for both CoronaHiT-Illumina runs. The different methods produced different amounts of demultiplexed data. For the routine samples, CoronaHiT-ONT yielded 9.6 Gbases of sequence data, ARTIC LoCost sequencing produced 8.0 Gbases of data, and CoronaHiT-Illumina yielded 15.7 Gbases giving on average 1145X, 1719X and 4649X coverage per sample (Table 1). For the rapid response dataset, CoronaHiT-ONT produced 5.7 Gbases, ARTIC LoCost 4.5 Gbases, and CoronaHiT-Illumina 7.3 Gbases resulting in 1104X, 1421X, and 3010X coverage per sample respectively. Both CoronaHiT-ONT runs had less variation in coverage between samples compared to the ARTIC LoCost runs, with lower standard deviation relative to the mean (Table 1). The The demultiplexing steps for CoronaHiT-ONT were different from those used for ARTIC ONT sequencing as described in the methods section. Comparing the nanopore sequencing methods for the routine samples, 74.7% and 81.9% of reads were demultiplexed successfully for CoronaHiT-ONT and ARTIC LoCost respectively when only reads with a PHRED (quality) score above Q7 are considered; for the rapid response set, 69.6% and 71.6% were demultiplexed for CoronaHiT-ONT and ARTIC LoCost. The rest of the reads were unassigned, due to an inability to detect the barcode sequences at both ends of the reads. The negative controls contained zero mapping reads to SARS-CoV-2 for all nanopore datasets. The Illumina routine dataset had mapped reads, however, the vast majority were primers dimers (range of 0-4 SARS-CoV-2 reads &gt;40bp mapped out of the 3 negative controls).For the routine samples, 30 hours of sequencing data was used for both CoronaHiT-ONT and ARTIC LoCost, and for the rapid response set, 18 hours was used; the full dataset was used for both CoronaHiT-Illumina runs.

        <p>Poor quality consensus genomes were generally associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the clinical samples i.e. higher RT-qPCR Ct values (generally above Ct 32) were more likely to fail COG-UK and GISAID quality control thresholds. For all methods the number of Ns increased significantly in samples with a Ct above 32, which equates to approx 100 viral genome copies in the PCR reaction (Figure 2). Supplementary Figures 1a-f The number of samples passing the COG-UK QC criteria was 73 for ARTIC LoCost, 76 for CoronaHiT-ONT and 78 for CoronaHiT-Illumina in the routine set and 44 for ARTIC LoCost, and 48 for both CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina in the rapid response set. The stricter GISAID QC criteria reduces the number of samples passing QC, with the CoronaHiT method outperforming ARTIC LoCost. For the routine samples, 59 samples passed for ARTIC LoCost, 66 passed for CoronaHiT-ONT and 74 passed for CoronaHiT-Illumina and for the rapid response set 40 passed for ARTIC LoCost, and 44 passed for both CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina. Overall, the pass rate was 64.3% for ARTIC LoCost, 71.4% for CoronaHiT-ONT and 76.6% for CoronaHiT-Illumina. When considering higher viral load samples with a known Ct of 32 or below, the pass rate for both GISAID and COG-UK QC was higher, with 89.2% passing for ARTIC LoCost and 95.2% and 97.6% passing for CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina, respectively (full details are shown in Table 2). CoronaHiT-ONT had a higher pass rate compared to ARTIC LoCost even though the average coverage was lower, this related to more even coverage across samples on the flowcell (lower standard deviation between samples relative to the mean -Table 1).Poor quality consensus genomes were generally associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the clinical samples i.e. higher RT-qPCR Ct values (generally above Ct 32) were more likely to fail COG-UK and GISAID quality control thresholds.

        <p>To assess the impact of data quality differences on clustering of lineages, we built maximum likelihood trees for both the routine and rapid response runs with each of the 72 and 44 consensus genomes that passed QC from the ARTIC LoCost, CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina sequencing experiments. When the consensus genomes were placed on a phylogenetic tree for the routine set, CoronaHiT-Illumina, ARTIC LoCost, CoronaHiT-ONT showed the same clustering for most samples, except for three cases (EB1DB, EC741 and EC644) where we note that their ARTIC LoCost consensus show an increased number of ambiguous bases. All variant differences between the samples are noted in Supplementary Table 3, together with the sequence length (discounting ambiguous bases whenever there is a difference). Out of all samples in both datasets, there were only two SNP discrepancies, one in sample F04F8 between CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina, with ARTIC LoCost calling the SNP ambiguous, and in sample F0A23 with CoronaHiT-ONT disagreeing with the other methods (Supplementary Table 3). The SNP differences did not affect the classification (i.e. closest sequence in the database), and there were no SNP differences between ARTIC-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina. The main other source of variation between the samples is that the Illumina genomes allow IUPAC (IUPAC-IUB Comm. on Biochem. Nomenclature (CBN) 1970) symbols for "partially" ambiguous bases. These data show that CoronaHiT provides highly accurate lineage calling compared to ARTIC LoCost.To assess the impact of data quality differences on clustering of lineages, we built maximum likelihood trees for both the routine and rapid response runs with each of the 72 and 44 consensus genomes that passed QC from the ARTIC LoCost, CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina sequencing experiments.

        <p>Rapid viral genome sequencing during outbreaks is changing how we study disease epidemiology (Kafetzopoulou et al. 2019;Joshua Quick et al. 2016). The recent SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has again highlighted the use of sequencing in the control of the spread of the disease. Nanopore technology is particularly suited to outbreak sequencing as it is portable, does not require expensive machinery and is accessible throughout the world (Faria et al. 2016). We present a novel platform agnostic method, CoronaHiT, for flexible throughput, cost effective and low complexity sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to respond to the pandemic at the local and national level.Rapid viral genome sequencing during outbreaks is changing how we study disease epidemiology (Kafetzopoulou et al. 2019;Joshua Quick et al. 2016).

        <p>The ARTIC LoCost protocol (Quick, 2020) has been widely adopted for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and allows up to 95 samples (plus a negative control) to be sequenced at a time on a MinION. CoronaHiT is just as cheap, simple and fast, but the combination of transposase introduction of adapters with PCR based barcoding allows for more even coverage between multiplexed samples, resulting in a higher proportion of samples passing QC. It is also designed to be platform agnostic, simply switching barcodes to move to Illumina. This allows the user to flexibly sequence low or high throughput depending on rapidly changing requirements in the pandemic (Bayliss et al. 2017;Josh Quick 2020). With the use of asymmetric barcode primers described in Perez-Sepulveda et al. 2020, it is possible to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at very high throughput on Illumina; in fact we have recently sequenced over 1000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes on a single Illumina NextSeq High Output run using this approach (data not shown). The CoronaHiT-Illumina library preparation method is cheaper (reduced reaction volumes) and significantly more streamlined (no sample washing or quantification before pooling, no use of stop solution, no clean-up after tagmentation and no clean-up of barcoded PCR products) than standard Illumina library preparation.The ARTIC LoCost protocol (Quick, 2020) has been widely adopted for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing and allows up to 95 samples (plus a negative control) to be sequenced at a time on a MinION.

        <p>Tiling PCR approaches, such as ARTIC, are prone to high genome coverage variation due to variable primer efficiency in multiplex reactions. Some regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have hundreds of times higher coverage than adjacent regions using ARTIC, therefore average coverage of at least 1000X is required to obtain at least 20X coverage of the difficult regions of the genome. We demonstrate that we can achieve &gt;1000X SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage in ~20 minutes per sample using CoronaHiT-ONT on MinION, with a full set of 95 samples taking ~30 hours). While the CoronaHiT-ONT runs described here are very consistent, sequencing yield depends on flowcell quality. We recommend aiming for at least 100 Mbases of estimated sequencing yield per sample to provide sufficient data for &gt;1000X coverage/sample (average across flowcell) using CoronaHiT-ONT.Tiling PCR approaches, such as ARTIC, are prone to high genome coverage variation due to variable primer efficiency in multiplex reactions.

        <p>Results demonstrate that all methods are unreliable at producing high quality consensus genomes from positive clinical samples with diagnostic RT-qPCR Cts above 32 (approx. 100 viral genome copies), however, CoronaHiT performs better in these samples (Figure 2), producing fewer Ns, likely due to the additional rounds of PCR during barcoding.Results demonstrate that all methods are unreliable at producing high quality consensus genomes from positive clinical samples with diagnostic RT-qPCR Cts above 32 (approx. 100 viral genome copies), however, CoronaHiT performs better in these samples (Figure 2), producing fewer Ns, likely due to the additional rounds of PCR during barcoding.</p>
        <p>Below or equal to Ct 32, CoronaHiT-ONT, CoronaHiT-Illumina and ARTIC LoCost produce similar results. While more samples pass both QC measures with CoronaHiT-ONT and CoronaHiT-Illumina compared to ARTIC LoCost, primer dropout regions can be more pronounced in these methods (Supplementary Figure 1). For higher quality consensus genomes, sequencing may be run for longer. Additionally, a reduction in ARTIC PCR annealing temperature from 65°C to 63°C may help improve coverage across these regions (Benjamin Farr et al. 2020). However, data produced from CoronaHiT was sufficient to provide accurate consensus genomes that result in the same lineages and on the same branches on the phylogenetic tree as ARTIC LoCost (Figure 3). In conclusion, we demonstrate that CoronaHiT can be used to sequence 96 SARS-CoV-2 samples on a single MinION flowcell, with the option of higher throughput on Illumina. This platform agnostic method is simple, rapid and cheap and results in more samples passing QC than ARTIC LoCost while providing almost identical phylogenetic results.Below or equal to Ct 32, CoronaHiT-ONT, CoronaHiT-Illumina and ARTIC LoCost produce similar results.
