        <p>Increased sequestration of CO2 into agricultural soils, and where relevant avoided emissions of N2O, from cultivation of additional 'cover' crops during periods when cash crops are not growing (i.e. in fall after cash crop harvest or in early spring before planting of cash crops, or on existing fallow areas).</p>
        <p>Cover crops can build soil organic carbon (SOC) and reduce SOC loss from erosion, take up nitrogen and reduce nitrate leaching, control pests and weeds, and -in the case of leguminous cover crops -reduce the need for nitrogen fertilizer (79). The greater the cover crop biomass, the greater the benefits, and biomass varies with growing conditions and the type of cash crop. Insufficient warm temperatures in the fall or suboptimal growth due to soil moisture limitations create a temporal conflict with cash crop harvest. Thus, we assumed higher adoption of cover crops if the previous cash crop matures early in the growing season or is suitable for interseeding with cover crops (e.g. winter cereals). Favorable spring conditions occur when the subsequent cash crop is seeded late enough for appreciable spring growth of winter cover crops. Further, in dry climates, cover crop opportunity depends on sufficient spring precipitation to replenish surface soil moisture after the winter cover crop.</p>
        <p>Based on the 2017 Farm Management Survey (D. Cerkowniak, AAFC, pers. comms.), we estimated there are currently 630,000 ha of cover crops, with adoption rates varying across Canada. Highest adoption is in the Mixed Wood Plains ecozone in Ontario and Quebec with 6.6% and 6.93% adoption of spring and post-harvest seeded cover crops, respectively. Adoption in the Prairie provinces on brown and dark brown soil is 0.91% for spring cover crops and 0.04% for post-harvest cover crops, and 0.14% for spring cover crops and 0.24% post-harvest cover crops on the remaining soil types (black, dark gray and gray). Given insufficient data, we assumed that the Boreal Shield and Montane Cordillera ecozones would have the same current adoption rates as on black, dark gray and gray soils in the Prairies, and that the Maritime provinces would have half the current adoption rates as the Mixed Wood Plains.</p>
        <p>Although cover crops can cause phosphorus (P) losses from soils (79), the limited studies for Canada have not shown significant P loss (80, 81). We therefore did not reduce the area of opportunity in watersheds where P loss is a potential concern (e.g. basins of Lakes Winnipeg and Erie), but flag that future research should determine the water quality impacts of cover crops on P losses in sensitive watersheds. We assumed up to 63% of cropland with annual cash crops (20.5 million ha) could adopt additional cover crops, but that the rate of adoption varied by the type of previous cash crop and location.</p>
        <p>We assumed all farmers will adopt cover crops only for the subset of their fields that have the most favorable conditions in any specific year for successful cover crop production (e.g. timing of cover crop seeding opportunity, soil tractability for seeding, subsequent cash crop wellsuited to cover crop). We conducted our analysis separately for each polygon in the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) database (82) as per the NIR (19). In the Prairies, we further subdivided our estimates by soil type (e.g., brown, dark brown, black, dark and gray (83)).</p>
        <p>Current adoption levels stem from 2016, the most recent year for which data are available; we assumed linear increases from this level in 2020 to full adoption in 2030.</p>
        <p>Cover crops can impact net GHG emissions in four different ways. Cover crops can increase rates of SOC sequestration. They can increase or decrease direct N2O emissions, depending on whether the cover crop is leguminous or not, respectively. They can reduce indirect N2O emissions by preventing leaching and if leguminous, reduce the need for fertilizer and thus upstream emissions from fertilizer manufacture. We accounted for each of these dynamics.</p>
        <p>A global meta-analysis (84) estimated that cover crops can capture an additional 0.32 Mg C/ha/yr of SOC (when cover crop biomass is an average 1.87 Mg C/ha). This rate is similar to observed rates in the Mixed Wood Plains (0.24 Mg C/ha/yr) (85). We adjusted 0.32 Mg C/ha/yr downwards in cooler and drier areas where C inputs from the cover crops are lower than in milder climates (86,87) and upwards in the Pacific Maritime ecozone to account for the mild wet winters that are conducive for winter cover crops (84) (Table S3). Moreover, cover crops differ in how they influence SOC depending on when they are seeded. For example, increases in SOC in fallow areas are typically less limited by climate than in areas with cash crops because cover crops grow during the best summer growing conditions. The harvest date of the previous cash crop is also important. For example, clover biomass can be as high as 1.27 Mg C/ha when interseeded with early maturing spring wheat or as low as 0.31 Mg C/ha when interseeded with later maturing corn (88). Thus, we further adjusted rates of SOC sequestration by expected time of harvest of the previous cash crop. We did not, however, adjust for cover crop type assuming an appropriate type will be selected for the relevant growing conditions. Although legume cover crops may lead to lower sequestration rates of SOC compared to non-legume cover crops, reported differences are not significant (84,89). After adjustments, SOC sequestration rates ranged from 0.025 Mg C/ha/yr for post-crop seeding in the brown soil zones of the Prairie provinces, where growth conditions are most constrained, up to 0.64 Mg C/ha/yr for cover crops combined with very early cash crops in the Pacific Maritime and for fallow in the Mixed Wood Plains and Maritime provinces (Table S3). We assumed a linear SOC rate through 2050, as a linear rate may be valid for up to 53 years (84).</p>
        <p>To account for changes in direct N2O emissions, we relied on data from meta-analyses that show that non-legume crops reduce total annual direct N2O emissions, while legume cover crops increase these emissions (90,91). This pattern is consistent with the only Canada-specific study we found, which observed increases in N2O emissions during a single legume cover crop cycle compared to no cover crop (92). We modeled the change in annual N2O emissions (N2Odirect), dependent on proportion of leguminous cover crops (proportionlegumes) in an SLC polygon as: ΔN2Odirect = N2Odirect× [0.9 + proportionlegumes×0.2] Thus, for non-leguminous cover crops, annual N2O emissions were reduced by 10%. For a 50:50 mix of leguminous and non-leguminous cover crops, there would be no impact on N2O emissions and for 100% leguminous crops the annual N2O emissions would be 10% higher (93). We derived annual N2O emissions using methods in the NIR (19).</p>
        <p>Cover crops can also significantly reduce indirect N2O emissions by reducing nitrate leaching, with an observed reduction of 40% and 20% in leaching for non-leguminous and leguminous cover crops, respectively (89). Reductions in leaching depend on cover crop biomass and plateau when cover crop biomass reaches 3.3 Mg dry matter/ha (94). We assumed 3.3 Mg dry matter biomass (i.e. ~ 1.87 Mg C/ha) corresponded to 0.32 Mg C/ha/yr of additional SOC sequestration and so scaled the leaching effect by our predicted SOC sequestration rates (SOCseq, see Table S3). Therefore, we modeled changes in indirect N2O emissions (N2Oindirect) as: SOCseq/0.32)] × [0.4-proportionlegumes×0.2] The unitless 1 -min (1, SOCseq /0.32) term modulates N2Odirect as a function of cover crop biomass, using SOC sequestration rates as a proxy for biomass, and plateaus when these rates are 0.32 Mg C/ha/yr. The unitless 0.4-proportionlegumes×0.2 term adjusts for the differential effect of crop type on nitrogen leaching (i.e., 40% reduction for 100% non-leguminous crops versus a 20% reduction for 100% leguminous crops).</p>
        <p>Finally, leguminous cover crops can reduce yearly fertilizer needs for the subsequent cash crop (termed "N credit"). The estimated N credit for a leguminous crop in Ontario is 45 kg/ha for most following cash crops, but 80 kg/ha if the crop is corn (95). We assumed that the observed N credit in Ontario corresponds to a SOC sequestration rate of 0.32 Mg C/ha/yr and again used our predicted SOC sequestration rates (SOCseq, see Table S3) to scale the fertilizer effect. We then further scaled the fertilizer effect by the proportion of annual crop production represented by corn (proportioncorn) per SLC polygon. We estimated the impact of reduced fertilizer use only on upstream fertilizer manufacture since reduced N2O emissions from the avoided fertilizer in the field would be offset by increased N2O emissions from N added by the leguminous cover crop. We assumed that upstream fertilizer manufacturing released 4.05 kg CO2/kg N (96). Thus, we modeled changes in fertilizer use (kg N/ha; Nfertilizer) per SLC polygon as:</p>
        <p>ΔNfertilizer = [SOCseq/0.32] × [45 + proportioncorn×35] × proportionlegume</p>
        <p>where SOCseq /0.32 is a unitless scaling factor to account for differences in crop biomass, 45 + proportioncorn×35 is a unitless scaling factor to account for the different fertilizer requirements for corn versus non-corn crops, and proportionlegume is the proportion of legume cover crop included to account for the N credit from leguminous crops. The increase in direct N2O emissions from legume crops exceeded the indirect benefit of avoided fertilizer manufacture, so we assumed a 50:50 legume/non-legume mix (except for 100% legume cover crops on existing fallow) to maximize the N credit. Finally, we included an annual 15 kg CO2e/ha deduction to account for fossil fuel emissions from shallow soil disturbance due to the seeding of cover crops (97).</p>
        <p>We estimated that current cover crops provide 0.57 Tg CO2e/yr of mitigation, and that increased adoption could provide up to 9.78 (7.6 to 12.1) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 2050 (Table S4), and cumulatively 48.9 (38.2 to 59.6) Tg CO2e by 2030 and 244.5 (190.6 to 298.4) Tg CO2e by 2050. These opportunities are distributed across Canada (Fig. S2), with the largest opportunities in the Prairie provinces. Eastern provinces offered mitigation potential that is relatively high on a per-hectare basis as well as having relatively low mitigation costs (Table S4; Fig. S2).</p>
        <p>For uncertainty, we assumed that adoption is more uncertain in western Canada where cover crops are not common and used an asymmetrical triangular probability to reflect that we could be overestimating increased adoption by as much as 66% in Alberta and Saskatchewan and as much as 50% in Manitoba and BC (percent 95% CI). In eastern Canada, we assumed that we could be overestimating increased adoption by 10% (percent 95% CI). For all provinces, we assumed we could be underestimating adoption by 10%. For changes in emissions, we assumed a normal distribution with ± 25% (percent 95% CI) that combined uncertainties for SOC change and N2O emissions from the NIR (19)</p>
        <p>We modeled cover crop adoption in any SLC polygon where cover crops resulted in positive economic value (value of mitigation + value of N + non-N private valueimplementation costs). We assumed that the cost of N was CAD 1.2/kg N (95). Implementation costs included annual additional machinery and operation costs (CAD 30/ha) and seed costs, which we modeled as lowest for cereals (CAD 40-130/ha) and highest for legumes (CAD 100-200/ha) (98). We determined annual seed cost (costseed, CAD/ha) per SLC polygon as: costseed = 50 + proportionlegume×70 such that 50% legume cover crops in the cover crop area equaled CAD 115/ha (i.e. 30 for seeding and 85 for seed), the median cost for seeding cover crops from a survey of US farmers (99). We did not include costs for cover crop termination, assuming that herbicides or tillage would be used regardless of cover crop adoption. We assumed maximum adoption per cover crop type within each SLC polygon where the value of mitigation plus the value of N provided by cover crops exceeded the seeding costs.</p>
        <p>Farmers generally report benefits beyond reduced N inputs, including improved soil resilience to drought and various stresses, reduced loss of soil nutrients from erosion and leaching, avoided tillage to repair channeling from soil erosion, better soil biological health in terms of soil structure and nutrient cycling, less expensive management of weeds, diseases, or pestsbenefits typically sufficiently larger than seeding costs for cover crops (100,101). Based on a survey of US farmers, these soil benefits can increase over time, meaning it may take up to 3 years to cover seeding costs and 5 years of continual use to achieve benefits that exceed annual costs for seeding cover crops (99). We assigned a net present annual value of CAD 85/ha across Canada for benefits beyond direct N benefits from cover crops. The amount of adoption is strongly affected by this private value. If the value exceeds the cost of seeding cover crops (CAD 80-150/ha for 0-100% legumes), maximum adoption is profitable in our analysis regardless of carbon price. Much higher private values are possible; for instance, private values of cover crops are reported as high as CAD 600/ha for seed corn in southern Ontario (102). With the composition of legume cover crop used in our analysis and CAD 100/Mg CO2e of benefits, the total area of cover crop adoption increases to 0.78, 1.73, and 3.55 Mha for private value of CAD 0, CAD 25, and CAD 50/ha, respectively. Although we assumed a single private value across Canada (CAD 85/ha), benefits likely vary regionally, which could greatly affect adoption. Improving the quantification of long-term economic benefits of the cover crops is essential to enabling growers to assess the economic value of cover crops so they can make informed decisions on adoption.</p>
        <p>We estimated MAC based on soil type and crop rotation. At CAD 10/Mg CO2e, additional cover crop area was confined to existing fallow and to cash crop areas in the favorable climates of Mixed Wood Plains and Atlantic and Pacific Maritime reporting zones. At CAD 50/Mg CO2e, cover crops occupied almost all existing fallow, almost all potential cropland in the favorable climates, plus some areas of early-harvested cash crops in less favorable climates. At CAD 100/Mg CO2e, we estimated an additional area of 6.5 M ha of cover crops almost entirely in the Prairies. In general, average mitigation per ha dropped with more land in cover crops: 0.88, 0.80, 0.60, and 0.48 Mg CO2e/ha for CAD 10, CAD 50, CAD 100/Mg CO2e, and maximum adoption, respectively. To reach 95 and 99.9% of maximum mitigation would require carbon prices of CAD 155 and CAD 235/Mg CO2e, respectively. Based on our economic and flux assumptions, these annual emission changes could be achieved in 2030 and maintained through 2050.</p>
        <p>We thus estimate that 1.4, 4.5, and 8.2 Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 are possible at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively (Tables S2 andS4). Cumulative mitigation potential from 2021 to 2030 is 7.0, 20.9, and 41.2 Tg CO2e at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. Cumulative mitigation potential from 2021 to 2050 is 35, 104.5, and 205.8 Tg CO2e at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively.</p>
        <p>Increased sequestration of CO2 in soils from use of crop residue to produce biochar or avoided GHG emissions from substitution of gasoline with bioethanol produced from crop residue.</p>
        <p>To determine available crop residue, we first assessed total annual production of crop residue in Canada, and then deducted the amount needed for livestock as well as the crop residue with transportation limitations. To assess total annual production, we used crop area data (circa 2016) and the average residue yield over five years (2014 to 2018) aggregated at the ecodistrict scale of the National Ecological Framework (103). We estimated crop residue for corn and small grains (oat, barley, wheat, rye, and triticale), lumping rye and triticale with wheat because these crops are not widely planted. We examined systems where the residue is baled after conventional grain harvest, which are most practical in Canada because they prioritize efficient grain harvest during the typically time-constrained harvest season between crop maturity and winter onset. For small grains, crop residue is dropped from the combine and baled while residue from corn is shredded, raked, and then baled. That said, not all residue produced is baled. Total above-ground residue removal is 37-38% for small grains but 57% for corn (19). We estimated rates of residue removal, based on measured bale yields after rotary combines, of 0.5, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.55 Mg of oat, barley, wheat, and corn residue per Mg of grain, respectively, at moisture contents of 15% for small grains and 25% for corn stover (19,104).</p>
        <p>We estimated the amount of residue needed for on-farm feeding and bedding of livestock for all of Canada as 5.9 Tg per year. We adjusted the total amount of residue required for bedding and fodder for cattle as reported in (104). This adjustment accounted for the shift in western Canada from winter feeding of beef cattle in small paddocks with bedding to feeding in large fields without bedding, as well as the shift towards non-straw bedding (e.g. sand and composted manure) for dairy cows. Therefore, we estimated livestock needs for crop residue as 1500 kg/beef cow (mostly for fodder) and 300 kg/dairy cow per year. We assumed these estimates represent the residue requirement for all livestock, including the smaller residue needs for non-beef livestock. Based on their relative feeding value, we ranked residue for livestock in the order of oat, barley, corn stover, wheat.</p>
        <p>To account for distance of crop residue from farm to bioethanol facility, we estimated the average transportation distance needed to sustain a facility capable of producing 70 million liters (L) of ethanol per year. This estimate relied on the methods of (105) applied to the 51 agricultural ecoregions in Canada and the total amount of cereal residue available in each ecoregion (106). When the average transportation distance exceeded 60 km, we excluded residue removal for bioethanol, an exclusion of 0.24 Tg/yr of residue in 17 ecoregions within British Columbia, the Boreal Shield, and the Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador).</p>
        <p>Based on the above discounts for livestock needs and transportation limitations, we estimated a total potential supply of crop residue of 25.7 Tg per year, composed of 0.4, 1.5, 7.8, and 16.1 Tg of oat, barley, corn, and wheat residue, respectively. For implementation of the Biochar pathway, we assumed all residue would be available based on the rationale that the carbon stays on the farm site. For implementation of the Bioethanol pathway, given the need to maintain soil condition, we assumed only 50% of available residue would be harvested in any one year in any ecoregion by 2030 (105). We further assumed that residue extraction would increase linearly from 2021 to 2030 to 100% of available residue by 2030.</p>
        <p>Currently, Canada has no commercial-scale production of bioethanol from crop residue. In 2018, Canada consumed 3,140 million L of ethanol for biofuel, of which it produced 1,900 million L from grain (mostly corn and wheat) and imported 1,390 million L (107). Canada consumed 46.3 billion L of gasoline so the average blend rate with ethanol is 6.6%.</p>
        <p>The long-term sequestration of carbon in soils from biochar is 0.18 Mg C/Mg of biomass, or 0.66 Mg CO2e/Mg of residue (8). We also accounted for the emissions associated with additional N fertilizer and residue harvest required to replace nutrients and collect the residue, as well as loss of SOC from reduced residue inputs, which generate emissions of 0.39 Mg CO2e/Mg of residue. Thus, the net benefit of biochar was estimated as 0.27 Mg CO2e/Mg of residue.</p>
        <p>Removal of crop residue can reduce SOC (108). We estimated that residue removal causes a reduction of 200 kg SOC/ha for each Mg C/ha of residue harvested, based on a metaanalysis of SOC loss from residue removal in Canada and the northern United States (109). We accounted for emissions related to baling of residue of small grains at 10 kg CO2e/ha and 50 kg CO2e/ha for chopping, raking, and baling of corn stover (110).</p>
        <p>We accounted for additional N fertilizer applied to soils to replace the N in removed residue, with values of 9. 0, 11.3, 10.3, 8.0, and 7.6 kg N/Mg residue for oat, barley, corn, wheat and rye, respectively. Consistent with methods in the NIR (19), we assumed the addition of N fertilizer has zero net effect of residue removal on N2O emissions because the total N added to the soil is not affected by residue harvest. However, we did account for emissions of 4.05 kg CO2e/kg N related to N fertilizer production and application (96).</p>
        <p>We modeled rates of ethanol production per Mg of dry matter as 270 L for oat, 310 L for barley, 330 L for corn, and 300 L for wheat and rye (105,111). We modeled emissions related to biorefinery production of ethanol, including acid pre-treatment, enzymes, fermentation, and distillation, as 0.49 kg CO2e/L (112). We modeled emissions related to transport of crop residue as 0.18 kg CO2e/Mg km (110) or 7.2 kg CO2e/Mg for an average distance of 40 km for 50% of available residue harvest. Thus, the total emissions of bioethanol were 0.082 and 0.137 Mg CO2e Mg of residue, or 29 and 62 g-CO2e/MJ, with and without accounting for GHG emission effects of the cover crops, respectively. The emissions of gasoline in Canada are 92 g CO2e/MJ. For a 1:1 displacement of gasoline on an energy basis, we estimated that the net benefit of ethanol was 30 and 63 g CO2e/MJ, or 0.116 and 0.078 Mg CO2e per mass-weighted average Mg of residue with and without including the GHG emission effects of cover crops, respectively.</p>
        <p>We modeled mitigation potential based on ethanol price and different cost categories for pricing carbon (Table S5). Residue removal has much stronger mitigation benefits when paired with cover crops and no-till practices, because these practices help to address loss of SOC and erosion risk from residue removal (113)(114)(115). To illustrate the importance of combining these practices, we included the mitigation benefit of using residue for ethanol both when combined with cover crops and no-till and when these practices are excluded (Table S5). We used the same fluxes associated with cover crops and no-till described elsewhere in this study. Crop residue on fields can constrain no-till adoption in Manitoba and eastern Canada, because it slows soil warming and drying in the spring (116). Thus, residue removal can increase no-till adoption. We therefore considered a scenario that also included additional adoption of no-till beyond the maximum adoption in the Reduced Tillage pathway, whereas as the cover crop estimates reflected actions covered by the Cover Crops pathway.</p>
        <p>Based on the available residue and the per ton mitigation benefit, the annual mitigation potential from incorporation of residue-derived biochar into agricultural soils is 6.9 (3.2 to 10.6) Tg CO2e/yr in both 2030 and 2050. Cumulatively, biochar could sequester 38.2 (17.9 to 58.4) Tg CO2e by 2030 and 176.9 (82.4 to 270.2) Tg CO2e by 2050, if production was linearly ramped up starting in 2021 and achieving maximum adoption in 2030.</p>
        <p>To estimate uncertainty around residue supply (B in Tg/yr), we used a triangular probability distribution to indicate that we could be overestimating residue harvest by 20% in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec and as much as 40% in Alberta and Saskatchewan where temporally variable residue yields and longer transport distances make residue harvest less favorable. For all other provinces, we assumed we could be underestimating residue harvest by 10%. For the mitigation potential of biochar per unit of residue biomass, we conducted a Monte Carlo analysis to combine uncertainties across each term in the following equation:</p>
        <p>where M is total mitigation, FC is carbon content of residue feedstocks by mass (in %), YC is "carbon yield" (% of feedstock carbon retained in char during pyrolysis), R is the fraction of char carbon that is recalcitrant (in %), and MRT is mean residence time of recalcitrant carbon. We drew mean and standard error estimates for R and MRT from a meta-analysis of 121 data points (117). We derived means and confidence intervals for FC and YC based on data from studies of residue feedstocks and pyrolysis yields (118)(119)(120)(121)(122). We modeled a normal distribution around each of these parameters, but included a right truncated distribution for R, since it cannot exceed 100% and a left truncated distribution for MRT since it cannot go below zero.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated a maximum annual mitigation potential in 2030 of 0.87 Tg CO2e/yr, without the use of cover crops and no-till (Table S2, Table S5). With further cover crops and no-till adoption, this rises to 2.92 Tg CO2e/yr. These results assumed an ethanol price of CAD 0.9/L, which does not reflect the increased production costs gasoline producers face as a result of substituting ethanol for crude oil. We estimate that cumulative emission reductions from 2021 to 2030 is up to 4.4 and 14.6 Tg CO2e without and with increased cover crops and no-till adoption, respectively. Cumulative emission reductions from 2021 to 2050 are up to 22 or 73 Tg CO2e, without and with increased cover crops and no-till adoption, respectively. These estimates do not include any mitigation already included in fully implemented Cover Crops and Reduced Tillage pathways so there would be no double counting; the mitigation would be higher if the Cover Crops and Reduced Tillage pathways were not fully implemented and cover crop and notillage adoption were only due to bioethanol production. In addition to uncertainty around residue described above, we assumed a normal distribution around bioethanol emissions of ± 30% 95% CI.</p>
        <p>These mitigation estimates may be conservative due to our assumptions around SOC loss and crop yield through time. The emissions intensity of bioethanol averaged 79 g CO2e/MJ without other interventions, and 80% of those emissions stemmed from loss of SOC. With concurrent application of cover crops and no-till, average emissions intensity fell to 44 CO2e/MJ, primarily because these practices better protect SOC. Estimates of emissions intensity for bioethanol production are particularly sensitive to changes in SOC stocks (123), and we used a higher rate of SOC loss per unit of residue removal than other modelling estimates (108,110,123). Similarly, to be conservative regarding the effect of residue removal, we assumed constant crop yields and thus constant residue availability, but production of oat, barley, corn, and wheat in Canada have been increasing at compound annual rates of 0.7, 0.5, 1.8, and 1.1% each year, respectively, from 1961 to 2018 (124). These yield increases would increase SOC by 13, 7, 44, and 19 kg C/ha/yr for oat, barley, corn, and wheat, respectively (125), reducing the negative effect of residue removal on SOC.</p>
        <p>We estimated the cost of harvesting and storing residue, replacing lost N fertilizer, and spreading biochar. We assumed biochar would be spread on one-fifth of the lands from which it was harvested each year. Costs varied across residue type, based on N removed along with crop residue that required replacement and variation in N concentrations of different crop types. Specifically, we assumed wheat provides the cheapest residue because of its low N concentrations. We estimated these costs as CAD 32/Mg of residue for wheat, CAD 36/Mg of residue for oats and barley, and CAD 52/Mg of residue for corn. We assumed the agronomic benefits of biochar (126, 127) covered the costs of pyrolysis (8).</p>
        <p>This calculation resulted in marginal abatement costs in excess of CAD 100/Mg CO2e for biochar from all residue types in 2030 (Table S2) and CAD 88, CAD 92 and CAD 142 per Mg CO2e for wheat, oat/barley, and corn, respectively, in 2050. Because 62.4% and 7.4% of available residue was wheat and barley/oat, respectively, 69.8% of the mitigation potential was available for less than CAD 100/Mg CO2e in 2050.</p>
        <p>We modeled production costs based on a 70 million L/yr biorefinery for which fixed costs related to ethanol production are reported as CAD 0.26/L and variable costs other than residue feedstock are CAD 0.36/L, of which enzyme cellulase was CAD 0.17/L (105).</p>
        <p>In terms of baled residue costs, we assumed a minimum price (surplus to livestock needs) of CAD 55/Mg residue. Saskatchewan is the principal jurisdiction with an abundance of crop residue compared to livestock requirements, so we determined straw price by willingness to sell residue rather than by buyers of residue for livestock needs who compete for a limited residue supply. For 2015-2018, baled straw at the originating farm cost approximately CAD 55/Mg (128) so we assumed farmers across Canada value baled residue similar to farmers in Saskatchewan. For corn, we estimated higher costs primarily due to the need to shred and rake stalks (129), meaning we modeled baled corn stover at CAD 68/Mg residue.</p>
        <p>We further assumed that the suppliers of residue were paid additionally for the N removed, with baled residue at a value of CAD 1.2/kg N (95), so that N fertilizer was used to replace N removal in residue. We assumed a cost of CAD 0.2/Mg/km for residue transportation by truck (105), which for 40 km was CAD 7.9/Mg.</p>
        <p>We modeled net costs for cover crops, including a private value of CAD 85/ha, as described in the Cover Crops pathway above for cover crops without legumes. We assumed no net cost for adoption of no-till practices to 2030.</p>
        <p>To model the price of bioethanol, we considered Canada's proposed clean fuel standard (130) which mandates a reduction in emissions intensity of liquid fuels over the next decade to 2030 (130). For gasoline, this requirement means a reduction from its current intensity of 92 g CO2e/MJ to 82 by 2030 and places a premium on low emissions-intensive biofuels as blends. In 2019, the US spot prices for bioethanol fluctuated between CAD 0.44 to CAD 0.56/L (131), so we assumed CAD 0.50/L as the floor price. Bioethanol prices well over CAD 1/L are relevant for Canada (105), so we considered bioethanol at CAD 0.9/L and CAD 1/L as sufficient for maximum feasible production (Table S5). These ethanol prices increase production costs for gasoline producers because they exceed the costs of gasoline production (crude oil and refining). Using the average 2010-2019 U.S. regular grade gasoline retail price (CAD 2.91/gal) and 72 percent share of production costs in gasoline retail prices during that same period (132), a gasoline-ethanol energy ratio per L of 1.494 (133) and the average CAD-USD 2019 exchange rate (1.296), the production cost of gasoline adjusted on an energy basis was equivalent to CAD 0.48/L ethanol. Thus, at an assumed ethanol price of CAD 0.9/L, gasoline producers face increased production costs of CAD 0.42/L of additional ethanol used in gasoline production. Irrespective of final incidence, this represents an additional cost to society that increases the marginal abatement cost of cellulosic ethanol from crop residue. This additional cost is not reflected in the marginal abatement costs shown in Table S5, which are based only on the production cost of ethanol.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential in 2030 of 0, 561, and 563, Gg CO2e/yr at a carbon price of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively, without the use of cover crops and no-till (Table S5). With cover crops and no-till adoption, the annual mitigation potential in 2030 rise to 2,394, 2,416, and 2,915 Gg CO2e/yr at a carbon price of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e (excluding cover crop mitigation), respectively. Our estimates of annual mitigation potential in 2050 were the same in 2050 as in 2030. These results assumed an ethanol price of CAD 0.9/L and do not reflect the increased production costs gasoline producers face as a result of substituting ethanol for crude oil. When these costs were included, the marginal abatement cost of ethanol from crop residue exceeded CAD 100/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>We estimate that cumulative emission reductions from 2021 to 2030 are 0, 2.8, and 2.8 Tg CO2e at mitigation value of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. Including cover crops and no-till adoption increases these values to 12.0, 12.1, and 14.6, Tg CO2e at carbon prices of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. Cumulative emission reductions from 2021 to 2050 were estimated as 0, 14, and 14 Tg CO2e at carbon prices of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively, and with no-till and cover crops rising to 60, 60, and 73 Tg CO2e at carbon prices of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively.</p>
        <p>We estimated that maximum ethanol production occurs at an ethanol price of CAD 1/L without requiring any additional financial incentives. At a price of CAD 0.5/L (which is the price that ethanol could demand based on the cost of gasoline on an energy equivalent basis), there was no appreciable economic ethanol production at a carbon price below CAD 280/Mg CO2e, even with incorporation of cover crops and no-till practices. At a value of CAD 0.9/L for ethanol, an agricultural system with cover crops and no-till adoption on all land showed the largest emissions reduction from bioethanol production.</p>
        <p>Avoided emissions of N2O from reduced nutrient inputs and reduced CO2 emissions from fertilizer manufacture through more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers.</p>
        <p>We examined the mitigation potential of Canada-wide adoption of 4R nutrient management, which includes four 'right' principles for nutrient application (right source, right rate, right time, and right place) to optimize crop nutrient needs while reducing nutrient losses (134). We focused on nitrogen (N) management in field crops, due to its important role in overall agricultural GHG emissions (135).</p>
        <p>We considered three levels of 4R adoption by 2030: 1) basic matching of the nutrient supply to crop needs based on limited monitoring of N status and field-level spatial resolution, 2) intermediate matching through detailed monitoring of nutrient status, manipulation of the timing of nutrient supply, and sub-field spatial resolution, and 3) advanced matching based on detailed monitoring of nutrient status and plant health, extensive manipulation of nutrient supply timing, and detailed sub-field spatial resolution. We estimated potential mitigation as the difference between an increased 4R adoption scenario and a BAU scenario.</p>
        <p>Since leguminous crops typically receive little to no application of N fertilizer, we focused on the area of non-leguminous crops (22.7 Mha) and held crop areas constant at their 2017 extents. We assumed adoption of at least the basic 4R level across 95% of this area, given the strong emphasis by agronomists and the fertilizer industry on adoption of 4R and growing awareness of the environmental benefits (e.g., reduced water pollution). For the intermediate and advanced levels of 4R adoption, we estimated no greater than 80% adoption. Thus, our maximum scenario of 4R adoption assumed 15% basic and 80% intermediate or advanced adoption over 22.7 Mha. We assumed a linear increase in adoption from 2021 to 2030 with maximum adoption reached by 2030.</p>
        <p>Based on surveys of fertilizer practice for the Prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) and central Canada (136), we estimated the BAU scenario as 50% adoption of the basic level, 8% of the intermediate level, and 2% of the advanced level of nutrient management.</p>
        <p>We estimated direct and indirect N2O emissions with the Tier 2 methods (137) used in Canada's NIR (19). We modeled N from crop residue, manure and fertilizer for each polygon in the SLC data (82), following the method of (138). Because N2O emissions are affected by how much N is retained in crop residue, we estimated residue N by extrapolating national yield increases from 1981-2018 forward. For each level of adoption, we multiplied direct N2O emissions from fertilizer and manure by a reduction modifier based on the expert opinion of 12 Canadian scientists convened by Fertilizer Canada in 2018 (https://fertilizercanada.ca/). For manure-N, the emissions reduction modifier for 4R implementation was 0.85, meaning that emissions would be 85% of those without 4R implementation. We used the same emissions reduction modifier for fertilizer-and residue-N applied to all non-leguminous crops in the basic level, except for eastern Canada where we used a modifier of 1.00 for crops other than corn or winter wheat. The latter modifier derives from potato and was applied more generally here. For the intermediate level of 4R adoption, emissions reduction modifiers were 0.80 and 0.75 in western Canada for irrigated potato and other crops, respectively, and 0.75 for corn and winter wheat without manure and 0.85 for other crops in eastern Canada. Finally, for the advanced 4R level, emissions reduction modifiers were 0.70 and 0.65 in western Canada for irrigated potato and other crops, respectively, and 0.65 for corn and winter wheat without manure and 0.85 for all other non-leguminous crops in eastern Canada. We found no data on the proportion of corn or winter wheat receiving manure. We therefore estimated this proportion from the proportion of manure-N to manure + fertilizer-N for each SLC polygon, e.g. if manure represented 25% of all applied N, then we assumed that 25% of corn or winter wheat received manure N in any one year. Since the area of these crops was always less than the area of all crops receiving manure, our assumption corresponds to a situation where corn and winter wheat assumed to be receiving manure-N also received fertilizer-N. Note that we did not change rates of manure-N application in any scenario. We also assumed that all potato crops in western Canada are irrigated.</p>
        <p>We estimated 0%, 10%, and 20% reductions in N fertilizer use for the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of adoption, respectively, while maintaining the same yields (139,140). Assuming a current nitrogen use efficiency in Canada of 68% (135), these fertilizer use reductions correspond to an increase in use efficiencies of N fertilizer to 76% and 85% for the intermediate and advanced levels, respectively. Finally, we estimated avoided emissions from N fertilizer manufacturing as 4.05 kg CO2e/kg N (96).</p>
        <p>The BAU scenario assumed use of N fertilizer, and thus N2O emissions, increased at the historical rate of 2.8% annually to 2030. Canada has been transitioning from a situation of N mining to N surplus from 1980 to present. Assuming fertilizer use in Canada will follow that of other developed countries (e.g. United States or France), this rate of increase should eventually drop (141) and thus we did not extrapolate any increase in N use after 2030. Fertilizer application can increase SOC via increased crop production and the additional SOC from increased fertilizer application can more than compensate for the increased N2O emissions (142). Under the BAU scenario, we estimated that fertilizer N use, crop yield, and soil N2O emissions would increase by 39, 16, and 27%, respectively. We did not include increases in SOC sequestration due to increased crop yield (142), because we assumed the same yield increases in our BAU and maximum adoption scenario. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize this dynamic, because options that reduce N use so that crop yields no longer increase or are reduced will diminish the mitigation value of this pathway.</p>
        <p>We estimated that annual mitigation in 2030, relative to the BAU scenario, was 6.3 (5.0 to 7.6) Tg CO2e/yr for maximum adoption of advanced 4R (Table S2). Based on our assumption regarding stable N fertilizer use and adoption after 2030, annual mitigation in 2050 was the same (6.3 Tg CO2e/yr) as in 2030. Cumulative emissions reductions by 2030 were 27.4 (21.9 to 32.9) Tg CO2e and, by 2050, 153.0 (122.4 to 183.5) Tg CO2e. In our scenario of maximum adoption of advanced 4R, 76% of the emissions reduction was attributed to reduced N2O emissions with the remainder to the avoided manufacture of N fertilizer.</p>
        <p>We used triangular distributions to estimate uncertainty envelopes. Adoption rates and mitigation benefits were based on relatively optimal conditions. Adoption of intermediate and advanced 4R practices could be overestimated by as much as 66% in western Canada and 80% in eastern Canada where farms are smaller, but underestimation is likely no more than 5% (95% CI). Similarly, emissions reduction per ha from intermediate and advanced 4R practices, as applied by farmers, may be 50% too high but no more than 11% too low, the latter limit based on N2O uncertainty in Canada's NIR (19).</p>
        <p>Based on commercial consulting rates (129), we estimated that annual monitoring costs for 4R implementation as CAD 3, CAD 7, and CAD 18/ha for basic, intermediate, and advanced scenarios, respectively. The intermediate and advanced scenarios required 20% and 40% enhanced efficiency of N fertilizers, respectively, at a price premium of CAD 0.35/kg N (143, 144) and additional machinery costs for within-field variable rate applications at CAD 6 and 9/ha, respectively.</p>
        <p>For each SLC polygon, we calculated the costs of each scenario as the cost of 4R implementation minus the price on carbon and cost savings from avoided fertilizer use. We assumed adoption of the scenario with the greatest economic benefits.</p>
        <p>In 2030, we estimated that 0.7, 3.3, and 5.7 Tg CO2e/yr are available at CAD 10, 50, 100/Mg CO2e, respectively (Tables S2 andS6). At lower carbon prices (CAD 10 and 50/Mg CO2e), the highest adoption rates for the intermediate and advanced scenarios occurred in Manitoba with 62% and 32% of national mitigation potential, respectively (Table S6). This province has higher inherent N2O emissions due to a wetter climate than Saskatchewan or Alberta, and thus showed the most benefit from large N2O emission reductions from 4R in western Canada. In contrast, at CAD 100/Mg CO2e, as well as with maximum advanced adoption, the provincial contribution to emission reductions scaled with total crop area, and at CAD 100/Mg CO2e, the total area of intermediate and advanced adoption was 18 and 60% of the potential area, respectively. Usually the advanced level of 4R adoption was favored economically over the intermediate level; indeed, a price of CAD 50/Mg CO2e was more likely to shift SLC polygons from intermediate to advanced rather than from basic to intermediate.</p>
        <p>Incorporating trees into agricultural landscapes offers many benefits in addition to carbon capture, including potential increases in crop yields, poverty alleviation, soil quality, biodiversity conservation, and improvements in air and water quality (145-147). We examined four of the multiple ways that trees can be incorporated into agricultural lands: riparian tree planting, tree intercropping, silvopasture, and shelterbelts. Riparian tree planting involves establishing tree buffers along water bodies to stabilize and cool stream channels, as well as to reduce the export of nutrients and sediment from agricultural fields into water systems (148). Tree intercropping (also known as alley cropping) refers to planting rows of trees at wide spacings with a companion crop grown between the tree rows. Silvopasture incorporates trees into grazing land to provide shelter or fodder for livestock, whereas shelterbelts are rows of trees or shrubs planted around or within fields and around livestock facilities to protect crops and livestock from wind and snow accumulation and to enhance biodiversity. For the first three, we examined the potential to expand these practices, whereas for shelterbelts we modeled avoided conversion.</p>
        <p>Increased sequestration of CO2 in plant biomass and soil resulting from establishment of widely spaced rows of deciduous trees into crop or hay fields.</p>
        <p>We constrained our analysis to Ontario and Quebec (149) because farms in other provinces typically rely on large machinery that makes intercropping difficult. To develop a scenario of expansion of tree intercropping, we first identified agricultural land cover (150) within Eastern Cool Temperate Forests (151). Research from the University of Guelph suggests that good productivity and economic returns from intercropping are possible within this area and vegetation class. We then identified locations with Class 3 soils using Land Capability for Agriculture mapping from the Canada Land Inventory (152) and that were cropped or used for hay (153). We estimated there are 271,757 ha of Class 3 soils currently used for hay, based on the 64.4% of total pasture and forage lands in Ontario and Quebec that have alfalfa and other planted hay species (20). We found a further 525,541 ha of area currently cropped as wheat, soybeans, or corn. Across this total area of 797,298 ha (45% in Quebec, 55% in Ontario), we modeled the establishment of tree intercropping systems with hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) or hardwood species (e.g., Red oak (Quercus rubra) or Black walnut (Juglans nigra)). We modeled establishment of tree intercropping across 10% of total area each year between 2021 and 2030.</p>
        <p>We did not estimate area uncertainty since we modeled a prescribed scenario of riparian tree planting.</p>
        <p>From a review of literature across North America, we determined establishment of hybrid poplar or hardwood species can capture an additional 0.70 ± 0.96 Mg C/ha/yr (mean ± SD) in biomass and 0.17 ± 0.56 Mg C/ha/yr (mean ± SD) in soil (149,(154)(155)(156)(157)(158)(159)(160). We focused on a commonly analyzed and recommended intercropping configuration from southern Ontario (154,155). This configuration has 15-m tree row spacing and 6-m spacing within a row, or 111 trees/ha. Because the flux data derive from plots with variable tree density (up to 500 trees/ha), we thus scaled flux estimates to a standard 111 trees/ha. Finally, we incorporated ecoregionspecific estimates of albedo change due to converting crop or grassland to tree intercropping systems. We scaled the albedo effect by the partial tree density in these systems (111 trees/ha instead of a standard 1650 trees/ha as in the restoration of forest cover pathway). This scaling resulted in an average -0.03 ± 0.02 Mg C/ha/yr (mean ± SD) deduction for albedo, weighted by the proportion of agricultural land in each ecoregion covered in hay (i.e., grassland) or row crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat).</p>
        <p>We did not account for potential reductions in N2O emissions due to reduced fertilizer use or more efficient nitrogen cycling by trees (161), which would increase the climate mitigation value of tree intercropping.</p>
        <p>We estimated the annual mitigation potential for tree intercropping as 3.9 (0.5 to 14.4) Tg CO2e/yr in both 2030 and 2050 and the cumulative mitigation potential in 2030 and 2050 as 21.6 (2.8 to 79.6) and 100.0 (13.1 to 368.9) Tg CO2e, respectively. We estimated uncertainty around mitigation based on uncertainty around the albedo effect, soil sequestration and biomass accumulation. We fit the parameters with normal distributions, except for biomass, which we fit with a log-normal distribution since biomass cannot go below zero.</p>
        <p>The financial return and carbon sequestration from intercropping depend on the baseline crop and tree production system, as well as tree species, density (distance between tree rows and between trees in each row) and management (154,(162)(163)(164). We identified farm-level cost data for five transitions to tree intercropping: hay to hay-hybrid poplar (162) and annual grains (cornsoybean-wheat or corn-soybean-barley rotations) to annual grains-hybrid poplar, annual grains-Red oak, annual grains-Black walnut, or annual grains-Norway spruce (154). We excluded the latter given potential undesirable albedo effects.</p>
        <p>We estimated the MAC for the remaining four transitions as the ratio of the net present value per ha of the intercropping transition and the summed discounted differences in net carbon sequestration per ha between the baseline crop and the intercropping system, through 2030 and 2050, respectively. The difference in the net present value of a transition was calculated by summing the discounted differences in annualized returns reported in the studies relevant to the transition (adjusted to 2018 CAD using Bank of Canada annual inflation rates). As described above, we based our analyses on a tree intercropping system with 111 trees/ha (154), but note that species choice and density affect the economic impact. Higher tree densities can increase the negative gap in annualized returns between hybrid poplar, Red oak, Norway spruce intercropping and crop-only systems (163). The opposite may be true for Black walnut intercropping in a soybean-corn-wheat/barley rotation (164). For the one study that did not report differences in net returns between baseline and intercropping systems for this configuration (164), we calculated the difference in annualized net returns as the mean of the differences reported for configurations using 96 and 128 trees per ha, respectively. For studies that did not report carbon fluxes for the crop and intercropping systems, we used the corresponding values for the crop-only and intercropping systems reported in (154), also for a density of 111 trees/ha. We found no studies on the economics of tree intercropping that included the value of intercropping outputs other than crops and harvested end-of-rotation timber, such as walnuts or biomass from thinning.</p>
        <p>Hybrid poplars in intercropping systems are commonly harvested at 15-20 years of age since these trees show declining productivity or senescence in this age range (162). Much of the harvest of hybrid poplar in Canada is used as a bioenergy feedstock that displaces fossil fuels, or for production of pulp and paper, solid and composite wood, and bioproducts. All these wood products, except pulp and paper, are long-lived relative to our 2050 horizon. Therefore, we counted the full carbon content of harvested tree biomass from poplars planted during our implementation phase (2021-2030) when estimating the 2050 MAC of poplar intercropping. Our MAC estimates represent full implementation costs regardless of whether costs are borne by landowners or covered via subsidies or other incentives to landowners (156).</p>
        <p>We allocated our area of opportunity to the four intercropping transitions as follows. We assumed the 271,757 ha in for hay could transition to hay-hybrid poplar. We assumed the 525,541 ha in wheat, soybeans, or corn could transition to annual grains mixed with hybrid poplar, oak, or walnut. We found no information on the current distribution of these different annual grain intercropping systems in Canada. We therefore assumed that half of the annual grain area (262,771 ha) would switch to annual grain-hybrid poplar, because hybrid poplar has a high potential for increased utilization as comparatively low-cost bioenergy feedstock (165-167) and appears to minimize negative impacts to farm profitability compared to Red oak and Black walnut (163). We assigned equal shares (131,385 ha) of the remaining area of opportunity to each of the MAC estimates for Red oak and Black walnut. We assumed a phased implementation starting in 2021 using ten equal-sized planting cohorts of 79,572 ha each.</p>
        <p>Our analysis indicates tree intercropping could achieve net increases in C sequestration of 4.15 and 7.0 Tg CO2e/yr at CAD 10 and 50/Mg CO2e, respectively. However, the net gains in C fluxes reported in the studies used in the economic analysis exceed the average gains in net C fluxes reported in the larger set of studies used to estimate the biophysical potential. In the interest of generating conservative estimates, we therefore constrained the mitigation potential at the three carbon price points to that estimated in the biophysical analysis, by apportioning the estimated biophysical potential to the three price points using the same MAC distribution estimated in the economic analysis. We do so because even at the lower average C flux gains, the MACs of the individual transitions remain below the same thresholds (CAD 10 and 50/Mg CO2e) as in the economic analysis.</p>
        <p>Increased capture of CO2 in plant biomass and soil resulting from expansion of silvopastoral systems into current pasture areas.</p>
        <p>We estimated potential area for expansion of silvopasture in Canada as 985,518 ha, using the 2016 Census of Agriculture (20) to determine total farm area with pasture (tame, seeded, or natural) and number of farms engaged in ruminant production. We assumed that ruminant farms could establish an average of 20 ha of silvopasture per farm in existing pasture lands. This area of opportunity represents 5% of the total pasture area in Canada. We assumed 111 trees/ha (168, 169). We did not estimate area uncertainty since we modeled a prescribed scenario of riparian tree planting.</p>
        <p>There is particularly limited research on silvopasture systems in Canada. We identified five studies from North America that described biomass and soil carbon accumulation resulting from the introduction of deciduous trees into existing pasture (160,(168)(169)(170)(171). Across these studies, we estimate that creation of silvopasture captures an additional 0.63 ± 0.34 Mg C/ha/yr (± SD) in biomass and 0.20 ± 0.32 Mg C/ha/yr (± SD) in soil compared to pasture-only lands. We included an albedo deduction, estimating an average albedo effect for a grassland-todeciduous forest transition, weighted by the total agricultural area in each ecoregion. As in the tree intercropping pathway, we scaled the albedo effect by the partial tree density in these systems. This resulted in an average -0.04 ± 0.03 Mg C/ha/yr (± SD) deduction.</p>
        <p>We estimate that the annual mitigation potential in both 2030 and 2050 is 2.8 (0.8 to 7.0) Tg CO2e/yr and that cumulative mitigation potential in 2030 and 2050 is 15.6 (4.8 to 38.5) and 72.3 (22.1 to 178.2) Tg CO2e, respectively. We estimated uncertainty around mitigation based on uncertainty around the albedo effect, soil sequestration, and biomass accumulation. We fit the parameters with normal distributions, except for biomass, which we fit with a log-normal distribution since biomass cannot go below zero.</p>
        <p>The farm-level financial impact of switching from conventional pasture to silvopasture depends on the particulars of the specific production system. Studies in temperate systems generally show that forage production of silvopasture is competitive with pasture-only (172, 173) as long as the tree and forage species have complementary interaction effects (174). Silvopasture improves animal productivity for both dairy and meat production and reduces calving difficulty, by reducing heat and cold-related livestock stress through shading and wind protection (173,(175)(176)(177). Adoption of silvopasture can result in a range of additional farm-level financial benefits such as income diversification from timber or tree fruit (178). In existing conventional pastures, establishment of silvopasture may require site preparation and active management during the tree establishment phase to ensure trees can outcompete existing forage crops and weeds and are not severely damaged by livestock (179). To our knowledge, no study exists for Canada that examines the farm-level financial impacts of switching from pasture-only to silvopasture, so it is unclear what the range of expected net financial impacts of such a switch may be for sites in Canada. A study in the U.S. that examined such a switch reports a positive net present value for silvopasture adoption (180), and others have documented that silvopasture outperforms pasture when existing systems are compared (173), although this finding can be sensitive to the choice of discount rate, at least if tree products are excluded (181).</p>
        <p>Due to the lack of data for Canada on the financial performance of a switch from pasture to silvopasture, and based on the U.S. studies, we estimated the cost of silvopasture adoption on our pathway opportunity area as follows. We assumed that on one-third of the opportunity area, a switch to silvopasture will generate net income gains for farmers. However, additional extension efforts may be needed to bring about this adoption, which carry a cost. We assumed that for this one-third of potential additional silvopasture lands, net gains for landowners and extension costs approximately balance out, resulting in zero MAC. On the remaining two-thirds of silvopasture opportunity area, we assumed farmers require financial incentives to adopt silvopasture, in the form of partial or full compensation for tree establishment costs. Given that in the Prairie Provinces, silvopasture often takes the form of shelterbelts ( 179), on one-half of these lands, we used the cost of shelterbelt replacement (see section on Avoided Loss of Shelterbelts), scaled to the silvopasture tree density assumed in this study (111 trees/ha; CAD 418/ha). On the remaining third of silvopasture opportunity area, we assumed payments to landowners would equal the payments made by the U.S. Environmental Quality Incentives Program for silvopasture establishment (182) in existing grasses adjusted to 2018 prices (CAD 323/ha).</p>
        <p>Increased capture of CO2 in plant biomass and soil resulting from establishment of deciduous trees within 30-m of water bodies, in agricultural lands where forest is the native cover type.</p>
        <p>We identified forestable locations with the Vegetation Zones of Canada map (151), selecting all 13 forest vegetation classes, and then mapping agricultural areas within these classes using the 2013 Canada Landcover data (150). We next mapped 30-m buffers around all streams, rivers and lakes in that forestable agriculture area using CanVec topographic data (183). To avoid double counting, we removed any buffer areas that overlapped with the area of opportunity for restoration of forest cover. Finally, we determined land cover within the buffer areas using the 2019 Annual Crop Inventory (153) and retained only areas used for cropland (66% of total area), grassland (4%), or pasture/forage (3%). This final deduction removed areas that currently have forest, urban, water, wetland, or naturally barren cover and left 200,319 ha of opportunity. We assumed that 10% of the area of opportunity was planted each year between 2021 and 2030. We did not estimate area uncertainty since we modeled a prescribed scenario of riparian tree planting.</p>
        <p>We compiled North American estimates of biomass stocks in deciduous riparian buffers of known age (148,184,185). Estimates spanned multiple stand ages, so we estimated changes in rates of biomass carbon accumulation (Mg C/ha/yr, rate) through time (age) using a linear model. The best-fit model was: rate = 0.07 (± 0.03 SD) × age + 0.20 (± 1.14 SD) These data indicate growth rates of riparian trees are 0.9 Mg C/ha/yr after 10 years and 2.3 Mg C/ha/yr after 30 years. While these growth rates are high for later years in the modelling period as compared to typical rates of tree growth in Canada ( 21), they are based on best-available evidence and likely reflective of growth potential in productive riparian sites of southern Canada. For SOC accumulation, we estimated an average rate of SOC accumulation of 0.88 ± 1.03 Mg C/ha/yr (± SD) from North American literature describing soil accumulation following restoration of forest cover (21,148,186,187). For albedo, we used ecoregion-specific estimates of the albedo change due to conversion of crop or grassland to deciduous forest cover. We assumed riparian buffers (and the Tree Intercropping and Silvopasture systems described above) would reach maturity, and hence the full albedo effect, at 40 years. This assumption resulted in an average albedo deduction of -0.53 ± 0.06 Mg C/ha/yr (± SD), weighted by area of opportunity in each ecoregion.</p>
        <p>We estimated that the annual mitigation potential for riparian tree planting in 2030 and 2050 is 0.7 (-0.9 to 2.3) and 1.6 (0.6 to 3.5) Tg CO2e/yr, respectively, and that cumulative mitigation potential in 2030 and 2050 is 3.3 (0.3 to 14.1) and 26.8 (6.0 to 78.3) Tg CO2e, respectively. We estimated uncertainty around mitigation based on uncertainty around the albedo effect, soil sequestration, and biomass accumulation. We fit the parameters with normal distributions, except for biomass, which we fit with a log-normal distribution since biomass cannot go below zero.</p>
        <p>We estimated the MAC as the total present value cost per ha of riparian tree planting divided by the total present value of the increment in net carbon sequestration per ha of riparian forest buffer, adjusted for albedo. We included establishment and management costs, as well as long-term opportunity costs associated with forgone rent or net revenue from agricultural land effectively retired from production (188).</p>
        <p>We estimated buffer establishment costs (site preparation, planting stock, tree planting, post-planting mortality replacement, and herbicide application) as CAD 3,920/ha based on the averages from (188)(189)(190)(191). We assumed an average cost of buffer management of CAD 451/ha/yr, based on the aforementioned studies and (192). We calculated these costs for the full 30m width of the forest buffer.</p>
        <p>Opportunity costs from displaced agricultural production can account for a large portion of the total cost of riparian buffers, especially where high-value crops are displaced (190,192).</p>
        <p>Especially in smaller watersheds with high-value agricultural uses, 30-m riparian buffers may impose very high opportunity costs on landowners that would be not be accepted without direct financial compensation (185). We accounted for these opportunity costs by assuming landowners would require payments equivalent to the present value of an infinite stream of land rental values on any lands beyond 3m from streams put into riparian forest buffers. We assumed no payments are required in the 3-m buffer in which water quality protection regulations restrict agricultural activity in many areas, such as Ontario's Nutrient Management Act of 2002 (193) and Quebec's Agricultural Operations Regulation (194).</p>
        <p>A substantial portion of these buffer establishment and management costs could be offset through harvest of the trees (190). However, our analysis did not incorporate costs and possible mitigation impacts associated with timber harvests in riparian forest buffers.</p>
        <p>Avoided emissions of CO2e from aboveground biomass and avoided loss of forgone carbon sequestration from retention of shelterbelts in agricultural lands</p>
        <p>Detailed estimates of mitigation potential from the avoided conversion of shelterbelts are available for Saskatchewan (195,196). These analyses estimate there are over 51,000 km of shelterbelts within Saskatchewan, of which 2,491.2 km were lost between 2008 and 2016. These rates of shelterbelt loss and the carbon per linear extent differed by soil zone (i.e., dark brown, black, dark gray, and gray soils) (195). For other Prairie provinces (Alberta and Manitoba), similar detailed assessments are lacking but soil zone data do exist. Outside of the Prairie provinces, conversion of shelterbelts is occurring (197), but given a lack of soil zone data we did not assess mitigation opportunity outside of the Prairie provinces.</p>
        <p>We scaled Saskatchewan-specific estimates to Alberta and Manitoba by first assuming that shelterbelt density (i.e., km/ha of agricultural area) was proportional by soil type across provinces, and thus used province-specific estimates of agricultural area by soil type to estimate shelterbelt extent in Alberta and Manitoba. We then applied the observed loss rates from Saskatchewan, which ranged from 3.2 ± 1.5 % (mean ± SD) on black soils to 8.6 ± 1.5 % (mean ± SD) on gray soils to predict rates of conversion (195). This resulted in an estimated potential to avoid conversion of 586 km/yr of shelterbelts across the three Prairie provinces (227, 56, and 303 km/yr in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, respectively). As a point of reference, a 2014 survey of 191 producers primarily in Manitoba found 91% had shelterbelts and that a quarter had removed shelterbelts in the past 10 years (197).</p>
        <p>Between 2008 and 2016, conversion of 2,491.2 km of shelterbelts in Saskatchewan released 0.70 Tg CO2e (or 0.09 Tg CO2e/yr) of aboveground carbon into the atmosphere (195). Emissions depended on vegetation type (i.e., coniferous or deciduous trees or shrubs) and the distribution of vegetation type was influenced by soil type. For example, shrub shelterbelts occur predominantly in brown, dark brown, and black soils, whereas conifer and deciduous shelterbelts were most common on dark gray and gray soils (195). We used the observed carbon density estimate of 85.56 Mg C/km in Saskatchewan, weighted by soil type (195), in Alberta and Manitoba and for modeling purposes assumed that emissions would be committed to the atmosphere upon conversion. We also assumed that coniferous and deciduous trees and shrubs would occur at the same frequency per soil type across the Prairie provinces (195). Based on this assumption, we estimated an average avoided loss of carbon sequestration of 2.16 Mg C/km/yr, weighted by soil and vegetation type, from protecting existing shelterbelts.</p>
        <p>We used the relative distribution of vegetation per soil type to deduct a weighted average albedo effect of 7.32 Mg C/km due to the avoided transition from woody coniferous or deciduous cover to crop cover. For the albedo calculations, we assumed that shrub cover was deciduous given the frequent use of Caragena arborescens and that shelterbelts are 2-m wide (171,198).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential in 2030 of 0.2 (0.0 to 0.4) Tg CO2e/yr and cumulative mitigation potential of 1.9 (0.5 to 3.3) Tg CO2e between 2021 and 2030. We estimated uncertainty around mitigation based on uncertainty around the albedo effect, average carbon within shelterbelts per soil zone and vegetation type, rates of carbon sequestration in intact shelterbelts, and rates of shelterbelt removal. We fit all parameters with normal distributions.</p>
        <p>A survey of Manitoba crop and dairy producers (199) found that, while three quarters of respondents considered shelterbelts important or very important to their operations, this percentage was significantly lower for crop producers than livestock producers. A quarter of respondents reported shelterbelt removal in the past ten years, and crop producers were more likely to have removed shelterbelts than livestock producers. Respondents who removed the most shelterbelts did so to make room for irrigation pivots and large machinery or to expand fields. Overall, maintenance time and cost, as well as cost and labor needed for planting were given as the most important reasons for not planting or maintaining shelterbelts. More than onefifth of crop producers reported shelterbelts taking land away from crop production as a reason. Crop producers also mentioned equipment size and productivity of adjacent crop land. These findings mirror those of surveys in Saskatchewan (200,201) in which the leading reasons given for shelterbelt removal were the need to operate equipment, the age or death of trees, and desire for more area for production. Many producers may not understand the direct monetary impacts of shelterbelts, highlighting the importance of outreach to landowners and provision of expertise and equipment for shelterbelt conservation (195,199,200).</p>
        <p>Additional actions deemed necessary to incentivize shelterbelt retention are the provision of payments to offset the costs of maintaining and replacing shelterbelts (199) and compensation for diminished crop productivity. Research on farmer participation in U.S. Farm Bill conservation programs shows that, while most participants were motivated by the environmental benefits of practices, incentives such as provision of expertise and financial payments are important for reducing the financial and technical barriers to practice adoption (202). We expect a similar situation in Canada, where surveys indicate that many landowners are willing to participate in conservation programs, and often at low cost (203,204). For crop producers, payments would aim to offset the loss of productive area due to the shelterbelt itself and due to increased competition for crops located in the shelterbelt-adjacent zone, as well as management inefficiency (from overlapping of seeding and spraying around shelterbelts). Such subsidies could take the form of carbon payments or other payments for ecosystem services. We do not expect livestock producers to require the same compensation to offset opportunity costs, given their tendency to perceive shelterbelts as having higher value for their operations than crop farmers (199,200). Indeed, shelterbelts in the Prairie provinces have a positive net present value for livestock farms in brown, dark brown, and black soil zones, but for crop farms only in brown and dark brown soil zones (201).</p>
        <p>To estimate the costs of shelterbelt replacement and renovation, we assumed all field shelterbelts that are in poor condition will be replaced during the first three years of pathway implementation, as reported for field shelterbelts removed during 2008-2016 in Saskatchewan (195) in Saskatchewan (195). We focused on field shelterbelts because they account for the majority of shelterbelt removal in Saskatchewan (195). In addition, given an average life expectancy of shelterbelts of 50 years (205), we assumed that in any given year, 1/50 th of the total potential of avoided shelterbelt loss (4,915 km) will be renovated to maintain its functionality. We calculated the cost of shelterbelt replacement as the sum of the costs of removing an existing old shelterbelt (182) and the costs of installing a new shelterbelt (205). We calculated the cost of shelterbelt renovation as the sum of the costs of removing the existing old shelterbelt trees and of replacement plantings (using containerized seedlings) and competition control (182). In all calculations, we assumed that shelterbelts will be single-row, because 88% of coniferous, 98% of deciduous, and 100% of shrub field shelterbelts removed in Saskatchewan in 2008-2016 were single-row (195). In addition, for all 4,915 km of shelterbelts whose loss is avoided, we calculated annual management costs as the sum of annual overhead costs and the costs of pruning, assumed to occur every three years (182,205). We assumed that to avoid shelterbelt loss, farmers would be compensated for the costs of shelterbelt replacement, renovation, and management for all avoided shelterbelt loss.</p>
        <p>We approximated opportunity costs of shelterbelts on croplands by applying annual cropland rental prices to the area in shelterbelts, for the duration of our 2030 and 2050 horizons, respectively. In doing so, we captured the full forgone income from the area in shelterbelts, but not the cost of any reduced production from tree competition and efficiency losses on shelterbeltadjacent croplands. However, we assumed these latter negative impacts are approximately balanced by the benefits of shelterbelts for crop production, which crop farmers widely acknowledge (200,201). We calculated average shelterbelt opportunity costs per ha by soil zone, as the CCS-level average rental price per ha of agricultural lands in each soil zone. We aggregated rental prices by soil zone because information on both shelterbelt carbon (content and fluxes) and loss rates are available at the soil zone-level (195). To convert shelterbelt length to cropping area forgone, we assumed all shelterbelts for which loss is avoided are single-row and that a single-row shelterbelt leads to a 5m-wide strip of land being taken out of crop production (171).</p>
        <p>Unlike other avoided conversion pathways, where we assume avoidance of conversion would effectively require land acquisition (via easements or outright purchase), we did not expect that acquisition would be needed to avoid shelterbelt loss. Most crop farmers are aware of the benefits they receive from shelterbelts; removal is driven by lack of time or money needed for shelterbelt maintenance or replacement and the perception of inefficiencies that shelterbelts impose on farming, rather than shelterbelts being seen as intrinsically incompatible with farming operations. We thus assumed annual compensation payments to offset perceived income loss from shelterbelts (along with subsidies to offset shelterbelt maintenance costs) would be sufficient to incentivize farmers to retain shelterbelts.</p>
        <p>We estimated the MAC of avoided shelterbelt loss as the sum of discounted annual shelterbelt replacement, renovation, and opportunity costs, divided by the discounted annual increase in net carbon sequestration over the BAU scenario (continuing shelterbelt loss). At the farm level, our costs of avoided shelterbelt loss may be biased high since they assume that landowners would be compensated for all shelterbelt-related costs. Given that shelterbelts also provide benefits to farmers and that farmers are aware of those benefits, we expect that most farmers who in the BAU scenario would remove shelterbelts would refrain from doing so even if they received payments that offset part rather than all of their shelterbelt-related costs.</p>
        <p>Avoided CH4 emissions from reduced methanogenesis through acidification of manure in handling facilities of swine and dairy farms.</p>
        <p>Several studies indicate significant potential to reduce methane (CH4) emissions in swine and dairy farms through acidification of manure slurries (206)(207)(208)(209). Acidification of fresh slurries to pH &lt; 6 through the addition of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) at ratio of 1-6:1000 (H2SO4:fresh manure) reduced CH4 emissions by 64-99% over approximately 2-4 months as compared to control treatments. Initial results for cattle manure and acid soils indicate acidification of slurry does not impact nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions following field application, while offering the benefit of greater plant available nitrogen (210).</p>
        <p>Currently, total annual CH4 emissions from manure management systems in Canada are about 3.9 Tg CO2e yr -1 , of which the dairy and pork sectors account for approximately 2.6 Tg CO2e yr -1 (0.9 Tg from the dairy sector and 1.7 Tg from the pork sector) (19). Methane emissions from liquid dairy manure during the warm summer months account for approximately 90% of annual emissions (211). Given the relatively low emissions during winter, we considered mitigating emissions through acidification of manure only between June and November. We focused on swine and dairy farms as these animal production facilities typically manage manure as a liquid (dairy: 57%; swine: 91%), with greater than 6 months manure storage capacity (dairy: 91%; swine: 92%) (212), making the conditions possible for acidification. We estimated the annual fresh manure production from the dairy and swine sectors in Canada at 20 and 22 Tg. Therefore, total annual H2SO4 required to acidify the manure during the warm months would be approximately 106 kilotonnes, assuming a mass ratio of 5:1000, H2SO4:fresh manure.</p>
        <p>We applied a feasibility constraint to account for the necessary outreach and extension activities required before adoption of the pathway can occur and assumed a start year for adoption of 2023. We focused on dairy and swine farms which could see a positive cash flow from adoption of this NCS strategy and modeled an adoption rate by these farms of 4% per year between 2023-2030.</p>
        <p>Using total annual CH4 emissions from management of manure from the dairy and swine sectors (19), we estimated per head warm season emissions in CO2e, and applied emission reduction fractions for dairy (0.74) and swine (0.96) calculated as the multi-study mid-point of cumulative CH4 emissions reductions (206)(207)(208)(209). We estimated the annual per head mitigation potential at 1.1 and 0.2 Mg CO2e for dairy cattle and swine respectively, yielding an unconstrained (maximum) mitigation potential of 1.0 and 2.8 Tg CO2e/yr when applied to a national dairy population of 0.943 M head and a swine population of 14,023 M head (213). We used a Sustained Global Warming Potential of 45 to convert to CO2e (214).</p>
        <p>We estimated that maximum mitigation potential due to improved manure management in 2030 and 2050 is 3.0 (1.5 -5.1) Tg CO2e/yr and 13.9 (7.5 to 23.6) Tg CO2e and 72.0 (37.8 to 125.1) cumulatively by 2030 and by 2050, respectively.</p>
        <p>We estimated uncertainty around model parameters from the literature whenever possible or expert judgement when necessary. We estimated uncertainty (± SD) in annual and cumulative mitigation for the dairy and swine sectors at 40 and 37%, respectively. The range in mitigation estimates is large, the distribution is log-normally distributed and is primarily driven by uncertainty in the rate of producer adoption, estimated by expert judgement as ± 50%. Manure management through acidification is relatively unknown in North America but currently adopted throughout Denmark. Although we delay the start year for adoption to 2023, and limit adoption to farms achieving cost neutrality, it is possible that administrative constraints as well as cultural and health and safety concerns could negatively impact adoption. Other significant sources of uncertainty include the per-head mitigation potential (± 32%) and the effectiveness of acidification at reducing methane emissions (± 10%). Currently available studies consistently show high effectiveness of acidification at reducing methane emissions, but the size of the samples is small, potentially underestimating true uncertainty.</p>
        <p>We adapted cost analyses associated with acidification of liquid manures developed for Denmark (215) to Canada, and computed total annual costs to install and maintain an acidification manure management system at farm sizes ranging from 75 to 950 animals (roughly 50 to 700 head of dairy cattle or 3,000 to 37,000 head of swine). Costs included the annualized infrastructure expense, as well as recurring expenses such as service contracts, electricity consumption, sulfuric acid, and other miscellaneous requirements. Revenues are also estimated, including income from carbon mitigation at price points of CAD 10, CAD 50, CAD 100/Mg CO2e, and a fertilizer equivalent value, estimated from the increase in plant available nitrogen of acidified manure (210).</p>
        <p>Relative to the BAU scenario, the emission reductions in 2030 were estimated as 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 Tg CO2e/yr for CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. Cumulative reductions in emissions between 2021 and 2030 were 2.7, 3.5, and 4.6 Tg CO2e for CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. Cumulative emission reductions for 2021 to 2050 were 14, 19, and 25 Tg CO2e for CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Summing costs and revenues, we estimated the cost-neutral farm size at different carbon price points which were approximately 280 and 120 head at CAD 50 and CAD 100/Mg CO2e for dairy farms. No cost-neutral solution was found for dairy farms up to a farm size of 700 head at a price point of CAD 10/Mg CO2e. For swine, the cost-neutral farm size was approximately 19,000 head at CAD 10/Mg CO2e, while at CAD 50 and CAD 100/Mg CO2e even the smallest farm size of 3,000 head was cost neutral.</p>
        <p>In this analysis, we assumed manure management systems have a lifespan of approximately 25 years, and that the infrastructure replacement would not be accelerated to adopt this manure management practice. Therefore, we limited potential adoption to 4% of producers that would be replacing manure management systems in any given year, that also achieves cost neutrality.</p>
        <p>Avoided N2O and CO2 emissions from reduced use of nitrogen fertilizers by switching cultivation from non-legume to grain legume crops.</p>
        <p>For ecoregions in Canada with agriculture, we analyzed the 2016 Census of Agriculture (20) and NIR ( 19) to estimate areas in different crop types for 2015 to 2018. We compiled information about areas and crops for fields with grain legumes (soybean, dry bean, pea, lentil, chickpea) and those without. We assumed the former fields used an agronomically and economically feasible mix of crops with legumes. Then, for the field area that had no legume crops, we modeled substitution of non-legume crops with grain legumes at the average proportion observed in fields with legume crops. Such a substitution would increase the area of grain legumes by 4.47 Mha by 2030. This represents a 67% increase in grain legume area relative to grain legume area in 2017 (6.5 Mha). From 2000 to 2019, the area in grain legumes increased by 170,000 ha/yr on average, though in recent years (2015 to 2019) this rate has slowed to 27,000 ha/yr (124). We used this latter rate of increase as the BAU scenario. We modeled a linear increase in grain legume area between 2021 to 2030.</p>
        <p>We estimated mitigation potential as the change in production-related emissions on an area basis (13) due to the substitution of grain legumes for non-legume grain crops. Productionrelated emissions included emissions associated with manufacture of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs, soil N2O emissions, and machinery operations. We included the N2O emissions expected from nitrogen added to the soil from crop residue, which are typically higher for grain legumes than non-legume grains. On average, total emissions for grain legumes were 610 kg CO2e/ha/yr lower than for non-legume grains.</p>
        <p>Grain legumes typically provide lower carbon input into the soil than non-leguminous grains. However, the effect on SOC from increases in crop yields relative to BAU is not fully reported in the NIR (19). In the absence of that information, we did not include this effect in our mitigation calculations of increased legumes.</p>
        <p>We estimated that increasing legume crops could contribute up to 2.6 (2.4 -2.8) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 2050. Cumulative mitigation was 14.1 (13.4 to 15.6) Tg CO2e and 62.0 (60.2 to 69.7) Tg CO2e between 2021 and 2050. The uncertainty in our estimates is asymmetrical, as they are based on relatively optimal rates of adoption, which could be limited by various agronomic or economic factors. We assumed a triangular probability distribution in which we could be overestimating the switch to grain legumes by 25% but underestimating by only 10%. We assumed that emission reductions were normally distributed with ± 14% uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Expansion of grain legumes will depend on market signals and prices to change the current distribution and abundance of crops in Canada's agricultural areas. Increases in the cost of N fertilizer from carbon pricing could induce greater production of grain legumes, depending on economic factors for competing grains. Direct payments for substitution of legumes for nonlegume crops to increase GHG mitigation may distort the grain market if all grains are not treated equally and have unintended consequences for world food security. Moreover, since Canada is the largest supplier for the world's international trade of peas and lentils, large production increases may lower their price in Canada and thereby the relative profitability of their domestic production. Grain legumes that are consumed directly (dry bean, pea, lentil, chickpea) have challenges with plant diseases and require careful management and favorable weather to achieve the high grain quality necessary to be profitable. For these reasons, the mitigation potential estimated here is an indicator of the benefit possible if Canada's economic situation, including market benefits for reducing farm-level GHG emissions by increasing legumes, favors legume over non-legume grains and, everything else being equal, that grain legumes should be given preference over non-legumes in the pursuit of agricultural-based mitigation.</p>
        <p>We estimated that there would be no additional mitigation at CAD 10/Mg CO2e. We estimated that carbon prices of CAD 50 and CAD 100/Mg CO2e would increase grain legume area by 100,000 and 250,000 ha/yr, respectively. Note, this latter rate of increase was observed between 2010 and 2014. Therefore, the mitigation potential was estimated at 0, 0.4, and 1.4 Tg CO2e/yr for CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. In 2050, we estimated that 0, 1.3, and 2.2 is possible at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. We estimated that cumulative mitigation potential between 2021 to 2030 is 0, 2.5, and 7.5 for CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively, and 0, 11, and 50 Tg CO2e for CAD 10, CAD 50, and CAD 100/Mg CO2e, respectively between 2021 and 2050.</p>
        <p>Increased sequestration of CO2 in soils from reducing the intensity of tillage (both no-till and reduced tillage practices) for croplands.</p>
        <p>Reducing the intensity of tillage can increase SOC (216). Indeed, changes in tillage practices since 1990 accounted for 5.7 Tg CO2e/yr of SOC sequestration in Canada (in 2017) (19). However, the 2016 Census of Agriculture (20) suggests the adoption of no-till has peaked outside of Alberta and Saskatchewan. This trend is attributable to the relatively poorer performance of crops grown with no-till in cool, wet spring conditions typical of agricultural areas in Canada (116) outside of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and northwest British Columbia. For provinces other than Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, we estimated that it is feasible to further increase no-till adoption to 85% (from 80% in 2016) within brown and dark brown soil zones and to 70% (from 64% in 2016) in the black, dark gray, and gray soil zones. These increases represent 1.3 Mha of additional no-till areas. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, we assumed half of the area of intensive tillage would be converted to reduced tillage. Outside of Canada's three westernmost provinces, reduced tillage can overcome the yield challenges of notill (116) while increasing SOC compared to intensive tillage (217). For these provinces, we thus estimated that it is feasible to increase adoption of reduced tillage from 37% (on average) to 55% for cropland. Combined this results in an additional 2.2 million ha of reduced tillage. We also assumed a modest increase of 0.1 Mha of new no-till in those provinces. We assumed a linear increase in adoption from 2021 to 2030, after which we fixed the area of no-till and reduced tillage from 2030 to 2050.</p>
        <p>We estimated changes in SOC based on the NIR (19), converted to linear rates over a 10year period (218). These rates ranged from 0.02 Mg C/ha/yr for conversion of reduced tillage to no-till in Atlantic Canada to 0.14 Mg C/ha/yr for conversion from intensive tillage to no-till in the black soil zone of the Prairie provinces. After 2030, we assumed the rates of SOC sequestration rates from adoption of reduced tillage dropped by 35% relative to the rates in the NIR (19).</p>
        <p>We also accounted for reductions of fossil fuel use, estimating 0.085 and 0.025 Mg CO2e/ha for intensive to reduced tillage transitions in eastern and western Canada, respectively, and 0.025 and 0.015 Mg CO2e/ha for reduced tillage to no-till transitions, in eastern and western Canada, respectively. In the NIR, reduced tillage and no-till are associated with decreases of N2O emissions in the Prairie provinces but increases in N2O emissions elsewhere. However, a metaanalysis of 54 Canadian studies (219) showed tillage systems do not influence N2O emissions as strongly as previously assumed (137). We therefore did not model effects on N2O emission from change in tillage practices.</p>
        <p>In 2030, we estimated a maximum annual mitigation potential of 0.9 (0.7 to 1.1) Tg CO2e/yr. Although adoption did not increase between 2030 and 2050, SOC rates declined by 55%. Therefore, we estimated a maximum annual mitigation potential in 2050 of 0.6 (0.5 to 0.8) Tg CO2e/yr. Cumulative emission reductions by 2030 were 4.5 (3.3 to 4.9) Tg CO2e and 15.4 (12.4 to 18.3) Tg CO2e by 2050.</p>
        <p>We modeled no-till adoption with an asymmetrical triangular probability distribution where we could be overestimating adoption by as much as 90% in Alberta and Saskatchewan but only underestimating by 10%. The rationale is that any reduction in the existing prevalent no-till would reduce net area of new adoption. In Atlantic Canada, where current adoption of conservation tillage is only 29%, we could be overestimating adoption area of new reduced tillage by 30% and underestimating it by 10%. For other provinces, reduced tillage is better established but there is still at least 35% of land available for adoption of reduced tillage. For these provinces, we assumed that we could be either overestimating or underestimating conservation tillage area adoption by 15%. We assumed that the uncertainty of emission reductions was normally distributed with confidence limits of ± 10%, since up to 60% of emission reductions for decreased tillage are due to reduced fossil fuel use, which is relatively well-characterized.</p>
        <p>Well-managed systems of reduced tillage and no-till can have lower production costs than intensive tillage and provide increased net economic returns if yields are at least equal to intensive tillage (220). Reduced tillage and no-till also provide long-term financial benefits from reduced soil erosion. However, given that reduced tillage and no-till are already widely established in Canada, provision of new payments to directly encourage late adopters while retaining current adopters may not significantly increase overall adoption. Increased adoption of reduced tillage and no-till may therefore depend on farmers being able to capture potential market benefits of reducing tillage in the context of a regenerative agriculture system of cropping (221). Transitioning from intensive to reduced tillage can move farmland into regenerative agriculture status, while shifting from no-till to reduced tillage in some years does not necessarily cause a transition out of regenerative agriculture status. Therefore, market signals will likely be important for switching from intensive to reduced tillage (except in Alberta and Saskatchewan), for increasing no-till from an already high level of adoption, or even for retaining the high level of no-till. We reflected the likely difference in effectiveness of economic drivers on adoption in how the estimated area of opportunity varied by mitigation cost per Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>For the Prairie provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba), preventing the loss of notill is as important as increasing no-till adoption given trends in agricultural practices in Canada. We therefore modeled a moderate increase in no-till that represented a net increase of 15, 35, and 60% of maximum possible increase at carbon prices of CAD 10, CAD 50, and CAD 100 per Mg CO2e, respectively. To model an increase in reduced tillage, we estimated the increase in area will be 33, 75, and 100% of the maximum possible increase in adoption at carbon prices of CAD 10, CAD 50, and CAD 100 per Mg CO2e, respectively. With these reductions in tillage intensity, we estimated that at carbon prices of CAD 100 or more per Mg CO2e, the area in reduced tillage or no-till would be approximately 80% of cropland in each province from Quebec westwards (&gt;95% in Alberta and Saskatchewan) and 66% in Atlantic provinces (Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Labrador).</p>
        <p>In 2030, we thus estimated that annual mitigation potential was 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 Tg CO2e/yr at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. At CAD 10/Mg CO2e, 51% of the emission reductions occurred in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec, with 47% in Alberta and Saskatchewan. At maximum reduction of tillage, these estimates shifted to 34% of the emission reduction occurring in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec and 65% in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This shift was in response to the estimated relative importance of emission reductions from reduced tillage adoption at lower mitigation values.</p>
        <p>Avoided N2O emissions from reduced fertilizer use, and reduced CO2 emissions from reduced fertilizer manufacture, as a result of increasing the abundance of legumes in grazed pastures.</p>
        <p>Sowing of legumes in grazed pastures can decrease the need for application of nitrogen fertilizer and possibly increase SOC, both of which contribute to mitigation of climate change. This treatment can offer higher quality pasture over the grazing season than untreated pasture (222,223). Increasing pasture legumes is achieved by including locally suited legumes in the species mix used in pasture establishment, managing grazing to increase the longevity of existing legumes (e.g. allowing legumes go to seed), or seeding legumes into established pastures that have inadequate legume composition. Evidence from a global modelling study indicates that increased sowing of legumes into grass pasture can increase SOC in eastern Canada and British Columbia, although not on the Prairies (224). However, since we found no applied studies to validate SOC change resulting from this practice in Canada, we did not include any effect on SOC in pastures from increasing legumes. Our analyses also did not include any effect of grazing management on SOC in pastures. Despite the strong evidence that grazed grassland in Canada holds more SOC than ungrazed grassland (225-227), additional opportunities are limited because most suitable grazing lands are already grazed. Moreover, grazing timing and intensity do not have a significant impact on SOC in Canadian pastures (228)(229)(230)(231). We therefore focused on the mitigation possible from less fertilizer application.</p>
        <p>By 2030, we estimated that it is feasible to reduce by 80% the 25.8 Gg of N fertilizer applied in 2017 on 0.53 M ha of tame pastures in eastern Canada and British Columbia through increasing legumes in pasture (i.e. a reduction of 20.6 Gg of N per year). We estimated that reduction in fertilizer N use from increasing pasture legumes occurs linearly from 2021 to 2030 and then remained constant to 2050.</p>
        <p>We estimated the amount of N fertilizer applied to tame pasture based on the N allocation method in Canada's NIR (19). We estimated direct and indirect N2O emissions using the Tier 2 method (137) in the NIR. We assumed no GHG emissions associated with sowing legumes as the practice of sowing can be accomplished in new or existing pastures without significant soil disturbance (232). We estimated emissions from avoided manufacture of N fertilizer as 4.05 kg CO2e per kg N (96).</p>
        <p>We estimated the maximum avoided direct and indirect N2O emissions in 2030 from reduced application of 20.6 Gg N fertilizer as 0.53 Gg N2O/yr, equivalent to 158 Gg CO2e/yr.</p>
        <p>We estimated that annual mitigation potential in 2030 from maximum avoided manufacture of N fertilizer is 84 Gg CO2e/yr. Thus, the combined annual mitigation potential is 0.22 (0.19 to 0.25) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 2050. The cumulative avoided emissions from maximum adoption of expanded legumes in pastures is 2.2 (1.1 to 1.4) Tg CO2e by 2030 and 14.4 (5.5 to 6.9) Tg CO2e from 2021 to 2050. We modeled uncertainty around the area of opportunity with a triangular distribution and uncertainty around N2O flux with a normal distribution.</p>
        <p>Costs related to implementation of this pathway include the seeding costs for legumes, costs to change grazing management to allow existing legumes to produce seed (i.e., labor, possible changes to fencing and watering infrastructure), and the cost of seeding into established pastures (seed, year delay before effective for N supply, risk of suboptimal legume establishment). We estimated that adoption will be 25, 33, and 66% of the maximum for mitigation values of CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e, respectively. Against these costs, we estimated savings related to reduced use of N fertilizer. Our fertilizer prices reflected expected increases due to carbon pricing for the CO2e emitted during manufacture of N fertilizer and transport to the farm. We assumed the average rate of application of N fertilizer was 47 kg N/ha or CAD 56/ha for N fertilizer worth CAD 1.2 per kg (95). We also assumed ongoing improvement in the cost-effectiveness of practices that increase legumes. Overall, we estimated that the mitigation potential at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2e is 60, 121, and 193 Tg CO2e/yr, respectively.</p>
        <p>Avoided emissions of above-and belowground biomass and soil carbon due to prevention of drainage, dredging, eutrophication or other anthropogenic activities in peatlands, freshwater mineral wetlands, and seagrass ecosystems.</p>
        <p>We estimated that there are currently 111.3 Mha of peatland (bog, fen, and swamp) in Canada (233, 234) and that 11,984 ha of peatland are disturbed annually by horticultural peat extraction, mining, road construction, well-pads and seismic lines. We used the following rationale. Approximately 600 ha of sphagnum bogs are drained and extracted for horticultural peat production each year in Canada (Canadian Sphagnum Peat Moss Association, pers. comm.). To estimate annual change of mine area, we mapped mine area in peatlands using the Human Footprint Inventory (HFI) data for 2010 and 2017 (235). This analysis provided an Albertaspecific estimate of 4,284 ha per year, which we assumed was the lower-bound of the total peatland mine area in Canada. For other jurisdictions, we estimated land-use change from forest to settlement ) in Canada's NIR (19) and assumed 30% of this area is mined peatland.</p>
        <p>Together these values yielded an estimate of total peatland area disturbed annually by mining of 7,500 ha. For roads and well-pads, we relied on the wetland and HFI data for Alberta from the sources listed above. We conservatively estimated approximately 293 ha (32.5 km, 9-m wide) roads and 651 ha of well-pads are built on peatlands each year. Similarly, we used these sources to estimate an annual change in seismic line area of approximately 2,940 ha/year. We consider this estimate of seismic line disturbance to be conservative as it does not include exploration in other jurisdictions and because of known limitations of HFI data for capturing low-impact or narrow lines (236). Given the uncertainty around avoided disturbance of well-pads (see below), we focused our analysis on the avoided peatland conversion of 11,069 ha/yr related to peat extraction, mining, roads and seismic lines.</p>
        <p>To estimate fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in undisturbed peatlands, we relied on a recent compilation (237) but evaluated only studies in which GHG fluxes were measured for at least four months in the summer period. Based on this criterion, we estimated mean annual CO2 uptake (± SD) of 77.8 ± 374.1 and 34.2 ± 264.7 g CO2/m 2 /yr for bogs and fens, respectively. We used the same criterion for CH4 flux studies, but recalculated non-growing season CH4 emissions as 15% of growing season emissions based on (238). Emissions during the non-growing season in (237) were often much larger than measured growing season values as they were derived from a small number of winter measurements at a few sites. Our resulting mean (± SD) estimates for CH4 flux were 6.2 ± 7.7 g CH4/m 2 /yr for bogs and 7.9 ± 9.8 g CH4/m 2 /yr for fens.</p>
        <p>For horticultural peat extraction, we accounted for changes in emissions of CO2 and CH4 between natural peatlands and unrestored extracted sites (239). For mines, we estimated avoided CO2 emissions based on aerobic decomposition of peat removed during mine construction, plus the loss of net annual CO2 uptake to account for forgone sequestration that would have occurred. We calculated total peat carbon mass by multiplying the mean bulk density of northern peatlands (118 ± 69 kg/m 3 (± SD) by mean organic matter content (90.7 ± 13% (± SD)) and the conversion factor for carbon content of organic matter (0.492 ± 0.024 g/cm 3 (± SD)) reported by (240). Assuming an average peat depth across the region of 1.5 ± 0.5 m (± SD) (241), we estimated an average carbon stock of 790 Mg C/ha. We modeled this stock as decomposing by 5 ± 2% (± SD) loss per year (242) and converted to CO2e, assuming aerobic decomposition in stockpiles or soil amendments. We also added CH4 emissions from disturbed areas based on emission values of undisturbed bogs to account for avoided CH4 emissions that would have occurred if the peatlands were not disturbed.</p>
        <p>For roads, we assumed all CO2 sequestration and CH4 emissions cease on newly created road areas and calculated the difference from natural fluxes. We included the effect of roads on adjacent peatlands based on shifts in CO2 (27761.7 ± 618.2 kg CO2/km (± SD)) and CH4 (151.5 ± 30.9 kg CH4/km (± SD)) reported in (243). For well-pads, we assumed all CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions cease once well-pads are in place, calculating avoided emissions as the area disturbed multiplied by natural fluxes in bogs and fens.</p>
        <p>For seismic lines, we estimated losses of organic matter as CO2 and soil compaction causing enhanced emissions of CH4. We did not account for lost carbon from trees following line clearing. Although trees can account for up to 50% of the annual carbon uptake in forested peatlands (244,245), evidence from studies of winter roads indicates that the ground layer may compensate for this loss, largely through an increase in moss and herbaceous productivity (246).</p>
        <p>To estimate carbon loss from surface soils, we assumed 32.2 ± 13.3% (± SD) loss of organic matter from the top 10 cm, a bulk density of 0.03255 g/cm 3 for poorly decomposed peat, and carbon content of 0.492 ± 0.024 g/cm 3 (± SD) for organic matter (240). All losses were assumed in the year of disturbance, with no further losses in subsequent years. Increases in CH4 emissions of 10.3% ± 2.8% (± SD) were based on the average increase across bogs and fens from ( 236), increasing at this rate over the average emissions across natural peatlands in our database.</p>
        <p>When calculations were completed, avoiding or restoring well-pads (see Wetland restoration below) did not appear to be viable pathway for NCS. Assuming the presence of a well-pad stopped uptake of CO2, but also prevented emissions of CH4, our modelling suggested minimal to no mitigation was possible. Similarly, large soil emissions of CO2 and CH4 in the first decade post-restoration were not compensated by a return to carbon sink by 2050. More data and study are needed before avoided well-pad disturbance or restoration can be assessed as an NCS.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated annual mitigation potential for avoided conversion of peatlands as 10.1 (2.2 to 29.7) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 3.7 (0.9 to 10.3) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative avoided emissions was 53.5 (42.0 to 65.6) Tg CO2e and 146 (28.0 to 458.1) Tg CO2e, respectively.</p>
        <p>To model uncertainty around mitigation, we found limited data around extent of disturbance. Therefore, we modeled uniform distributions for extent of horticultural peat disturbance, mine disturbance, road disturbance and seismic disturbance with 95% CI of ± 100 ha/yr, ± 4108 ha/yr, ± 32.5 km/yr, 13.0 km 2 /yr, respectively, based on regional assessments. We based estimates of flux uncertainty on observed variation in the literature and in the field, using normal distributions to model parameters. For uncertainty around bulk density, we used a lognormal distribution since bulk density cannot be less than zero. For percent soil organic matter, we fit the data with a truncated normal distribution since this value cannot be greater than 100%.</p>
        <p>We assumed horticultural extraction is the only type of peatland conversion that can potentially be avoided at CAD 100 or less per Mg CO2e. Peat mining in Canada occurs on both public and private lands (247,248). Payments for avoided conversion would need to offset lost income to peat extraction firms, as well as lost tax revenues and government royalties associated with peat production. Of these, the latter are negligible compared to the first two; for instance, 2009 royalties to Manitoba were less than 0.2% of peat market value (249). Since information on net income of the Canadian peat mining sector is unavailable, we estimated the operating surplus of a representative peat mining firm. Operating surplus is calculated before taxes and interest (debt servicing) and thus included both of these expenses, which may overestimate the opportunity cost to peat producers and government from avoided peat mining by the amount of the peat sector's annual interest payments.</p>
        <p>We estimated operating surplus based on (247) who reported the ratio of operating surplus to total sales of a representative peat harvesting firm in New Brunswick as 37.8%. We assumed this ratio is representative of the average peat mining firm in Canada and multiplied it by the total value of Canadian peat production in 2019 (CAD 309.6 million) (250) to obtain total estimated operating surplus from peat mining in 2019 (CAD 117.0 million). Dividing this operating surplus by the peat mining area under production in Canada (17,950 ha in 2017) (251) yielded an average operating surplus of CAD 6,520/ha/yr. At the 3% monetary discount rate, this calculation yielded a per-hectare PV of approximately CAD 217,000, assuming an infinite time horizon. While the latter assumption may not be realistic for the peat area currently under production (since peat soils become exhausted over a finite number of years), current production area accounts for less than 0.1% of Canadian peatlands (251), meaning production could continue long enough for annual operating surpluses to realize a positive PV.</p>
        <p>We estimated that avoided horticultural peat extraction could avoid 145 Mg CO2e/ha by 2030 and 435 Mg CO2e/ha by 2050, or 139 and 378 Mg CO2e/ha, respectively, if mitigation is discounted at 1%. Thus, even at prices of CAD 100/Mg CO2e, avoiding horticultural peat extraction is not feasible for either the 2030 or 2050 accounting horizon, except perhaps on select sites with exceptionally shallow soils. Rather, carbon prices in excess of CAD 1,560/Mg CO2e (2030 horizon) and CAD 550/Mg CO2e (2050 horizon) would be required to achieve competitiveness with peat extraction. These results are not particularly sensitive to observed fluctuations in recent peat prices (252), discount rates, or interest shares in operating surplus. For instance, 83% of the operating surplus of a peat mining firm would need to go toward debt servicing to make carbon payments of CAD 100/Mg CO2e competitive over the 2050 accounting horizon (assuming 3% discount rate). Similarly, a combination of 54% ratio of debt servicing to operating surplus and an 8% discount rate applied by peat mining firms would be required to make carbon payments of CAD 100/Mg CO2e competitive under a 2050 accounting horizon.</p>
        <p>Our analysis indicated avoided peatland conversion for horticultural extraction would be feasible only at carbon prices substantially in excess of CAD 100/Mg CO2e, consistent with (253) who reported the market value of peatlands in Manitoba exceeds their carbon value by over 50-fold.</p>
        <p>We used the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI) (254) in combination with hydrographic and wetlands geospatial datasets to estimate wetlands at risk of conversion in the Canadian Prairies. We identified intact wetlands (&lt;15 ha) where a 30-m buffer surrounding the wetland consisted of 50%, 65% or 85% cropland using the 2018 Annual Cropland Inventory (153). We assumed wetlands with cropland in 65% of their buffer are a reasonable indicator of wetlands most at risk of conversion, with wetland areas with 50% and 85% of their buffers in cropland representing the maximum and minimum extent of wetlands at risk, respectively. Based on these assumptions, we estimated approximately 355,813 (254,846 -451,789) ha of freshwater mineral (FWM) wetlands are at risk of conversion in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of Canada. We considered 24% of the PPR estimate (84,210 ha) to approximate the additional area of FWM wetlands at risk in the rest of Canada. This calculation yielded an overall national estimate of 440,023 (339,056 to 535,999) ha of FWM wetlands at risk of conversion. We assumed the total area of FWM wetlands at-risk across Canada could be secured through a 15-yr program, or 29,335 ha/yr, but for consistency with other pathways, we modeled mitigation potential based on 10 years (2021-2030) of avoided conversion, for a total securement of 293,350 ha of FWM wetlands at-risk of conversion.</p>
        <p>We estimated avoided loss of SOC following wetland drainage at 89.0 (47.2 to 130.8) Mg C/ha (255) with loss occurring evenly over 20 years (16.3 Mg CO2e/ha/yr). This time frame is consistent with international emissions reporting for wetlands (256) and C stock changes associated with wetland drainage and conversion to cropland. After this period of avoided stock change, we assumed an average annual sequestration rate of 5.7 Mg CO2e/ha/yr based on rates for temperate wetlands from (257) to account for the ongoing existence of the wetland.</p>
        <p>We also accounted for avoided emissions from croplands in the PPR that would have occurred after conversion using an emissions factor of 0.315 (0.229 to 0.404) Mg CO2e/ha/yr based on the Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Indicator (258) in priority wetland landscapes for the Prairie Habitat Joint Venture. From this total, we subtracted annual CH4 emissions from natural temperate wetlands using an emission factor of 136 (53 to 219) kg CH4/ha/yr (256) and converted to 6120 (2385 to 9855) kg CO2e/ha/yr using 45 as the 100-yr Sustained Global Warming Potential (214).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential for avoided conversion of freshwater mineral wetlands of 3.1 (0.5 to 5.7) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 0.0 (-3.5 to 0.4) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative avoided emissions was 17.0 (2.7 to 31.4) Tg CO2e and 61.5 (5.9 to 117.1) Tg CO2e, respectively. To estimate uncertainty around mitigation, we modeled variation around area of disturbance, SOC loss, cropland emissions and wetland emissions using normal distributions.</p>
        <p>We calculated land costs of sites of avoided conversion of freshwater mineral wetlands as the PV per ha of agricultural land values in CCS (Fig. S1). We assumed avoided wetland conversion would also generate transaction costs associated with land purchase or easements. We used unpublished estimates from Ducks Unlimited Canada of average indirect costs for avoided freshwater wetland conversion (CAD 527/ha) to quantify these transaction costs. Since wetland protection from avoided conversion generally entails improved habitat management, we assumed an average management cost of CAD 34/ha/yr based on Ducks Unlimited Canada data. These transaction and habitat management costs are based on data for the region which accounts for 76% of the area of potential for avoided wetland conversion. For each year-specific avoided conversion cohort between 2021 to 2030, we calculated the break-even price (CAD/ha) by subtracting total PV discounted costs per ha for land acquisition or easement, transaction costs and costs for habitat management thru 2030 or 2050, respectively, from the PV of total discounted GHG mitigation (tCO2e/ha) value at CAD 10, 50 and 100/Mg CO2e through 2030 or 2050, respectively. This approach yielded three break-even prices per cohort per time horizon (2030,2050), one each at CAD 10, 50, and 100/Mg CO2, respectively.</p>
        <p>We identified the area with potential avoided conversion of freshwater wetland for which PV total costs of avoided conversion per ha were equal or less than these break-even prices. At CAD 10/Mg CO2e, only 5,010 ha were at or below break-even price and only if loss was avoided in 2021. At CAD 50/Mg CO2e, there were sufficient freshwater wetlands with avoided conversion potential in each implementation cohort (29,504 ha) for which PV total costs of avoided conversion per ha were below respective break-even prices. Consequently, we estimated the full potential of this pathway (295,040 ha of avoided conversion) could be implemented at CAD 50/Mg CO2e or less.</p>
        <p>Seagrass grows in shallow, protected and semi-protected coastal habitats where two marine species, eelgrass (Zostera marina) and the introduced Zostera japonica, sequester carbon in soft sediments (259). In western Canada, these habitats occur in British Columbia, whereas on the east coast, seagrass beds are found on the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence estuary, with concentrations in Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Seagrass beds are also present throughout Prince Edward Island. Seagrass is limited in the Bay of Fundy but found in bays on the Scotian Shelf. Seagrass has been mapped in James Bay, but information from Canada's northern coastline is lacking. We compile the first aggregate of current estimates of occurrence and distribution maps of seagrass habitat in Canada, yielding a total area of 192,469 ha (259-263) (Fig. S4). This value likely substantially underestimates seagrass extent in Canada. The estimate for seagrass distribution in the United States (1,435,200 ha) ( 260) is approximately ten times higher, yet the coastline of Canada (243,042 km) is over ten times longer than the US. While differences in coastline characteristics and climate may influence the order of magnitude differences between the US and Canadian coasts, data deficiency is likely a major contributor to Canada's lower value. We therefore averaged our aggregate sum for Canada with the US estimate to generate an estimate of Canada's seagrass extent of 813,835 (192,469 to 1,435,200) ha.</p>
        <p>In Canada, and globally, seagrass decline is associated with changing land use and water quality, increases in human population, nutrient pollution from land, negative impacts of invasive species, commercial fishing and aquaculture and coastal land alteration (264). A recent compilation of seagrass habitat surveys in Canada (265) indicates, on average, 3% of seagrass beds are in decline. We used the global average change in extent (-6.9%) (266) to convert this decline to an annual net change in seagrass area of -0.21% (-0.069 to 0.12%) (approximately 1,676 ha/yr).</p>
        <p>We calculated avoided emissions over 10 years (2021-2030) based on annual avoided loss of seagrass extent and associated emissions from disturbance of seagrass sediment. We based estimates of emissions from carbon sediments following disturbance on data from temperate Zostera marina meadows in North American and European coasts (267). These data indicate an average value of organic carbon sediment in seagrass beds, extrapolated to a standard 1-m depth, of 8820 (5020 to 38,007) g/m 2 . Sediments at depths of 1m or less are most readily lost following disturbance but represent a conservative basis for estimating emissions following disturbance as they do not include carbon in deep sediments (268).</p>
        <p>We relied on (269) to convert carbon from lost sediments to CO2 based on organic matter decomposition rates following disturbance. We assumed aboveground and belowground seagrass organic matter was negligible. We calculated emissions rates from disturbed sediments in 50% oxic and 50% anoxic conditions (oxic conditions result in higher emissions, anoxic condition in lower emissions). We obtained annual emissions over 10 years for average sediment stocks. We assumed 50% (25 to 100%) of the carbon contained in the sediment is lost to the atmosphere, as per (8), acknowledging conversion of seagrass beds can result in carbon losses to the atmosphere of 25% to 100%, depending on the type of disturbance, possible re-burial of disturbed material and degree of carbon recalcitrance (268).</p>
        <p>Seagrass sediments naturally generate emissions of CH4 and N2O and we subtracted these from our estimate of avoided emissions. Based on (270, 271), we applied an annual 5.3 ± 0.4% (± SD) reduction to avoided CO2 emissions for CH4 and 4.6 ± 0.2% (± SD) for N2O using 45 as the 100-year Sustained Global Warming Potential (214).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential for avoided loss of seagrass of 0.1 (0.0 to 0.2) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and &lt;0.1 Tg CO2e/yr in 2050 (15,289, 5804 to 33044 MgCO2e/yr). By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative avoided emissions from 2021 onwards was 0.8 (0.3 to 1.5) Tg CO2e and 1.4 (0.5 to 3.1) Tg CO2e, respectively. To estimate uncertainty around mitigation we used a normal distribution for all parameters except seagrass extent which was better fit with a log-normal distribution.</p>
        <p>In Canada, seagrass declines are associated with changing watershed land use and water quality, increases in human population, nutrient pollution from land, negative impacts of invasive species, commercial fishing and aquaculture or coastal land alteration (264). Of these causes of decline, nutrient pollution and water quality could be addressed through interventions that reduce nutrient, sediment and pollution loading. However, the cost of such interventions is site-specific and depends on the proximity of local nutrients, sediment and water quality conditions to water quality thresholds for seagrass, all of which are needed to assess the scale of intervention needed to avoid seagrass loss. A study of NCS in the US estimated avoided seagrass loss would cost &gt;USD 100/Mg CO2e (8).</p>
        <p>Due to data paucity, we did not estimate the mitigation cost of avoided seagrass loss related to control of invasive species or changes in fisheries or aquaculture practices. Consequently, we assumed avoided seagrass loss has a MAC in excess of CAD 100/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Increased sequestration from rewetting and restoring wetlands, through restoration of hydrological function or topography, moss transfer, fertilization, nutrient management, vegetation management or disturbance management in peatlands, freshwater mineral wetlands, seagrass beds and salt marshes.</p>
        <p>Approximately 34,000 ha of Canada's peatlands are currently or have previously been used for horticultural peat extraction (19). We modeled the mitigation potential of restoration of 3,400 ha per year for 10 years (2021)(2022)(2023)(2024)(2025)(2026)(2027)(2028)(2029)(2030). We assumed restoration of mines and roads to peatland would be minimal during the 2021-2030 assessment period. Although seismic line restoration is ongoing, no data are available on GHG emissions post-restoration. Therefore, we did not include it in the analysis.</p>
        <p>We estimated mitigation potential based on the difference between fluxes at restored and unrestored sites. Flux of CO2 (g CO2/m 2 /yr) after restoration (yearrestore) was estimated from a 15-year chronosequence of restored bogs and fens, as:</p>
        <p>After 15 years since restoration, we modeled CO2 uptake as a 30-year linear decrease back to the natural rate (-77.8 ± 374.1 g CO2/m 2 /yr (± SD)). We estimated CO2 flux at unrestored sites as a linear decrease from flux in the first year after peatland disturbance (445 ± 10 g C/m 2 /yr (± SD)) through to 15 years (216 ± 43 g C/m 2 /yr (± SD)) based on (239), after which emissions were held at this rate for the rest of the modeling period. Flux of CH4 at restored sites was based on an annual mean for years 1-3 and 15 (239, 272), with a linear trend between years 3 (27.9 ± 18.8 g CH4/m 2 /yr (± SD)) and 15 (4.4 ± 7.7 g CH4/m 2 /yr (± SD)), after which we modeled a linear increase to the natural rate by 30 years after restoration (6.2 ± 7.7 g CH4/m 2 /yr (± SD)). We estimated the natural rate of CH4 flux based on the average of fluxes from unrestored sites for the modeling period.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential of 0.2 (-0.3 to 0.7) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 0.2 (0.0 to 0.8) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative mitigation was 0.6 (-1.7 to 2.9) Tg CO2e and 6.0 (0.5 to 25.8) CO2e/yr, respectively. To estimate uncertainty around mitigation, we assumed the area restored could vary ± 100 ha/yr (± 95% CI), using a uniform distribution. We based flux uncertainty estimates on observed variation from literature and field data, using normal distributions.</p>
        <p>We estimated the cost of peatland restoration ranges between CAD 3500-4000/ha (CSPMA, pers. comm.) and assumed an average cost of CAD 3750/ha. For each yearly cohort, we calculated total discounted (to 2021) mitigation per ha by 2030 and 2050, respectively, by dividing the cohort's annual net fluxes by the corresponding carbon discount factors using the carbon discount rate of 1%. We derived the MAC separately for each restoration cohort as the quotient of its PV restoration cost per ha and total discounted mitigation per ha by 2030 or 2050, respectively. We calculated total mitigation in 2030 and 2050 at each of the three carbon prices, for each age cohort for which MAC was lower than the respective carbon prices, as the product of the cohort area (3,400 ha) and the total CO2e mitigated by that cohort in 2030 or 2050, respectively, and summed over all cohorts. We estimated 0.06 Tg CO2e/yr of mitigation from peatland restoration would be available at or less than CAD 100/Mg CO2e with the remainder of the mitigation potential above that price point.</p>
        <p>Based on historical rates of wetland loss, we conservatively estimated the potential area of restorable freshwater mineral wetlands in the agricultural region of Canada to be 247,810 ha (123,905 -371,715 ha). This estimate is based on the 25-yr targets for restoration in the Prairie Habitat Joint Venture and Eastern Habitat Joint Venture, regional partnerships for habitat conservation that cover most wetland restoration in non-boreal Canada. As a point of reference, approximately 665,000 ha of wetlands have been lost since the 1950s in the Canadian Prairies and southern Ontario alone (Ducks Unlimited Canada, unpubl. data). We therefore estimated the mitigation potential of an ambitious program that restores 25,000 ha/yr over 10 years (2021)(2022)(2023)(2024)(2025)(2026)(2027)(2028)(2029)(2030) for a total area of 250,000 ha.</p>
        <p>We estimated an annual increase in SOC for 40 years following restoration of 2.2 ± 0.5 Mg C/ha/yr (± SD). This estimate is comparable to (255, 273) who calculated increases of SOC in restored wetlands of 2.7 and 3.1 Mg C/ha/yr, respectively. We accounted for avoided emissions from croplands in the Prairie Pothole Region that would occur without restoration, using an emissions factor of 0.315 ± 0.04 Mg CO2e/ha/yr (± SD) based on the Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Indicator (258). For the first 40 years after restoration, we subtracted emissions of CH4 from rewetted temperate wetlands using a Sustained Global Warming Potential of 45 (214) to convert to CO2e and an emissions factor of 153 ± 76 kg CH4/ha/yr (± SD), after which we used a methane emission factor for natural temperate wetlands (136 ± 42 kg CH4/ha/yr) (± SD) (256).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential for restoration of freshwater mineral wetlands of 0.4 (-1.6 -2.4) Tg CO2e/yr in both 2030 and 2050. By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative mitigation potential was 2.1 (-8.8 -13.0) Tg CO2e and 10.2 (-40.6 -61.0) Tg CO2e, respectively. To estimate uncertainty around mitigation, we modeled normal distributions around all parameters.</p>
        <p>The analysis of the MAC of restoration of freshwater mineral wetlands was similar in approach and sources to that of avoided conversion of this wetland type (see above). Restoration of freshwater mineral wetlands showed substantially higher costs for habitat management (CAD 278/ha/yr) than avoided conversion (CAD 34/ha/yr). The mitigation potential mitigation was also an order of magnitude smaller. As a result, our analysis indicated restoration of freshwater mineral wetlands was not feasible for CAD 100/tCO2e or less.</p>
        <p>We assessed the mitigation potential of a 10-yr program aimed at restoring 8,063 ha/yr of seagrass beds. Currently, seagrass restoration in Canada occurs principally in coastal British Columbia, with 14 of 15 reported restoration sites in this province and only one elsewhere in Canada ( 274). The majority (94%) of restored sites experience seagrass recovery or gains in seagrass area post-restoration. We first estimated that restoration can result in a gain of seagrass area of 10.6%, based on multiplying the global average rate for increasing seagrass area where gains are observed (11.8%) (266) by the observed rate of area gains for restoration in Canada. However, this rate of area gain is lower than the global restoration rates, which range from 29 to 52% (266). For this reason, we used an average value of 19.8% (11.8 to 29.0%) for restoration potential in Canada and assumed 5% of potential restoration areas were restored annually.</p>
        <p>Evidence suggests sequestration can increase four or five years after seagrass restoration (275) and carbon stocks can increase at restored sites (276). We calculated changes in carbon storage following seagrass restoration based on data from a large-scale project in Virginia, USA (270). We estimated carbon sequestration of 1.14 ± 0.26 Mg CO2e/ha/yr (± SD) for the first 10 years post-restoration, after which we modeled sequestration at 1.91 ± 0.43 Mg CO2e/ha/yr (± SD) for subsequent years (270).</p>
        <p>Seagrass sediments naturally generate emissions of CH4 and N2O so we subtracted these from our estimate of mitigation potential. Based on (270, 271), we applied an annual 5.3 ± 0.4% (± SD) reduction to CO2 uptake for CH4 and 4.6 ± 0.5% (± SD) for N2O using a 100-year Sustained Global Warming Potential (214).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential for restoration of seagrass beds of &lt; 0.1 (0.0 to 0.8) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 0.1 (0.0 to 0.3) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative mitigation potential is 0.4 (0.2 to 1.0) Tg CO2e and 2.8 (1.0 to 6.2) Tg CO2e, respectively. To estimate uncertainty around mitigation, we fit rates of restoration with a log-normal distribution and the remaining parameters with normal distributions.</p>
        <p>To estimate the cost of seagrass restoration, we analyzed costs of restoration projects featuring Zostera marina, Zostera japonica or Zostera spp. from (277). These estimates ranged from CAD 3,267 to 2,011,683/ha of restoration, depending on differences in restoration approach, project size and economies of scale, remoteness of site, project objectives and differences in costs captured in project estimates, among others. We assumed the cost distribution of Zostera projects in (277) represents the cost distribution of potential restoration projects in Canada. Given the estimated mitigation of 1 Mg CO2e/ha/yr, even the project with the lowest per-ha cost in (277) yields a MAC of CAD 1704/Mg CO2e over a 30-yr accounting horizon or CAD 5112/Mg CO2e over a 10-yr horizon. Thus, no seagrass restoration appeared feasible at the three carbon price points in this study.</p>
        <p>The most extensive opportunities for restoration of coastal marshes in Canada are salt marshes that were dyked and drained to create agricultural land (commonly referred to as "dykelands"). These activities are widespread on the shores of the Bay of Fundy of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, along the St. Lawrence estuary as well as the coast of British Columbia. We estimated the area of undeveloped dykeland that could be reflooded without damaging buildings or infrastructure as approximately 15,000 ha in New Brunswick (Claude Robichaud, New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, pers. comm.); 16,139 ha in Nova Scotia (278); and 12,990 ha in Quebec (259). We found no records of dykeland area in British Columbia. We assumed 10% of the total area of undeveloped dykeland (44,129 ha) would be restored per year for 10 years, i.e., 4,413 ha/yr (4,325 to 4,501 ha/yr).</p>
        <p>We estimated annual accumulation of organic carbon (OC) after reflooding of dykelands based on (279) who compared OC stocks accumulated in New Brunswick marshes recovering from dyking and drainage for periods ranging from 9 to 92 years. The rate of OC accumulation per year (OC, Mg CO2/ha/yr) was negatively related to time since reflooding (yearrestore) as: ΔOC = 34.19 (± 3.9) -0.3468 (± 0.06) × year restore This relationship is based on field data across 12 field sites that range from 9 to 80 years postrestoration (Chmura, unpubl. data) with ± SD shown. Thus, the yearly addition of CO2 stored in each 4,413-ha cohort decreased over time.</p>
        <p>In addition to serving as effective carbon sinks, the return of tidal waters to agricultural dykelands has an added mitigation potential. Agricultural lands are net sources of CO2 and N2O, but these emissions are largely eliminated with permanent reflooding with salt water. That said, a pulse of N2O was recorded in the first few days after reflooding of dykeland soil on the St. Lawrence estuary (280). To account for this release of N2O, we subtracted the CO2 equivalent of this pulse (67.5 ± 33.4 Mg CO2e/ha/yr, ± S.D.) from sequestration in the marsh soil in the first year of reflooding. This release was accounted for in each cohort and applied for 10 years, at which time all available dykeland was modeled as reflooded.</p>
        <p>If the agricultural dykelands had not been reflooded, we assumed CO2 and N2O emissions would have persisted throughout the modeling period. Our calculation of avoided CO2 and N2O emissions was 0.5 (0.375 to 0.75) Mg CO2e/ha/yr or forage/pasture lands and 1.5 (1.125 to 1.875) Mg CO2e/ha/yr for cropland. Based on agricultural land cover in the eastern Canadian dykelands (153), we calculated an area-weighted average 0.7 Mg CO2e/ha/yr. This value was multiplied by the cumulative area of reflooded dykeland each year, to the maximum at 10 years, and added to the mitigation potential of carbon stored in the accumulating soil of restored marshes.</p>
        <p>We estimated the annual mitigation potential of restoration of salt marshes as 1.5 (1.2 to 1.8) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 1.2 (0.9 to 1.5) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. Cumulative mitigation potential by 2030 was 8.1 (6.3 to 9.9) Tg CO2e and 34.1 (25.6 to 42.2) Tg CO2e by 2050. To estimate uncertainty around mitigation, we fit all parameters with a normal distribution except for emissions from pasture lands which was better fit with a log-normal distribution.</p>
        <p>We assumed the cost of salt marsh restoration on dykelands comprises the cost of land acquisition and activities to implement dyke realignment. We calculated land costs as the PV per ha of restored agricultural lands based on the agricultural land cost layer by CCS (Fig. S1). We calculated the cost of dyke realignment as the sum of costs associated with archaeological surveys; feasibility, design and baseline studies; and earthworks, including breaching of existing dykes, dismantling of associated aboiteaux, and construction of new dykes and aboiteaux behind the restored marshland area (281). We estimated costs of archaeological surveying as CAD 774/ha, earthworks as CAD 4,676/ha (CAD 500,000 per km of dyke and associated aboiteaux); and feasibility, design and baseline studies as CAD 1,741/ha of realigned dykeland (281). To estimate the cost of new dykes and aboiteaux, we conservatively assumed realignment will not reduce the current length of dykes, even though in some cases it can be expected to do so. We estimated the length of dyke per ha of realigned dykeland based on the average dykeland area per km of existing dykes, using a weighted ratio of total length of current dykes per dykeland area in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (estimated as described above), which yielded an areaweighted average of 107 ha of dykelands per km of dyke.</p>
        <p>We assumed costs of managed coastal realignment would be partially offset by avoided costs for maintenance and needed upgrades of existing infrastructure for flood protection to account for sea level rise and infrastructure ageing (278). Indeed, in some locations, managed realignment may be the most cost-effective alternative to upgrading (282) and result in large cost reductions compared to the conventional approach of upgrading existing infrastructure (281). This approach is increasingly considered as an effective strategy for mitigation of disaster risk (283).</p>
        <p>We accounted for costs of avoided topping-up of existing dykes (CAD 1,336/ha dykeland based on CAD 142,857/km of dyke ( 281)) and repair and maintenance of existing dykes (CAD 100/ha/yr of dykeland) that otherwise would be required. These maintenance costs represented the weighted average of annual maintenance and repair costs for dykes in Nova Scotia (CAD 2M CAD/yr for dykes and 245 associated water control structures) and New Brunswick (CAD 650,000/yr for dykes and 98 associated water control structures) (Claude Robichaud, New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, pers. comm.). Because of their high dependence on the site context, we did not include other avoided costs associated with upgrading existing infrastructure that may be required without coastal realignment (e.g., for upgrading or rehabilitating aboiteaux) and can dominate the cost of necessary upgrades to existing flood control infrastructure (281). We also did not include design costs associated with topping up of dykes or upgrading or rehabilitation of existing dyke-related infrastructure. The omission of these avoided costs associated with infrastructure other than the dykes themselves may bias upwards our cost estimate of managed coastal realignment. Our estimate of net cost of realignment of CAD 4,972/ha was calculated as the difference between non-land-related realignment cost (CAD 7,189/ha of realigned dykeland) and avoided dyke maintenance and topup costs (CAD 2,217/ha of realigned dykeland).</p>
        <p>To estimate the MAC of salt marsh restoration, we first grouped sites into ten equal-area cohorts for annual restoration of 4,412.9 ha each (i.e. one-tenth of the identified area of opportunity for salt marsh restoration as described above) in order of increasing land cost per ha. For each site in each restoration cohort, we then calculated the estimated MAC by dividing total PV realignment costs by the PV of net mitigation. These analyses indicated that 1.2 Tg CO2e/yr is available in 2030 for less than CAD 100/Mg CO2e and 0.1 Tg CO2e/yr is available for less than CAD 50/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Avoided emissions of CO2 from avoided conversion of perennial grasslands to annual harvest row-crops.</p>
        <p>Grasslands store vast quantities of carbon, primarily in soil organic matter, as well as in above and belowground vegetation biomass. When cleared or tilled to accommodate the expansion of row crop agriculture, a portion of this carbon is oxidized and emitted as CO2 (284). Notably, these emissions can be 'irrecoverable' over timescales relevant to climate mitigation (27). In regions with expansive grasslands and pasture lands, rates of conversion can be particularly high and persistent (285). By preventing this conversion, ensuing emissions can be avoided (286). We assumed a baseline rate of net annual grassland conversion of approximately 250,000 ha per year throughout Canada. This estimate was based on changes in perennial grass extent reported in the most recent two years (2011 and 2016) of the Census of Agriculture (20). In each year, we defined the total grassland extent as the sum of the "natural land for pasture", "tame or seeded pasture", and "all other tame hay and fodder crops" classes of the Census data. Our area estimate thus represents a net reduction in perennial grassland cover, rather than an increase in the extent of row crops (which was roughly twice as large as our estimate of grassland change). We favored this more conservative estimate since a portion of cropland expansion detected during this period likely reflects re-cultivation of cropland rather than true conversion of grasslands to row-crop production.</p>
        <p>Our analysis assumed this net annual rate of grassland conversion remains constant through 2030, such that 2.5 Mha of grassland would be converted by 2030 without proactive prevention. We estimated the uncertainty of this assumption to be 62%, the relative standard error for the slope of the 2001-2016 time series of Census-derived estimates of grassland change.</p>
        <p>We estimated SOC emissions with the Canadian Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Accounting and Reporting System model ( 287) for conversion of perennial to annual crop cover. The model derives from the widely used CENTURY model ( 288) and estimates nonlinear SOC emissions from grassland conversion at annual increments. Model predictions are based on Reporting Zones, akin to ecozones (103), and aggregated soil texture classes (coarse, medium, fine). We implemented the model spatially by combining estimates of grassland conversion per Reporting Zone with corresponding texture polygons from the 1:1M Soil Landscapes of Canada Database v3.2 (82) according to the Canadian soil texture classification system (289). Thus, each Reporting Zone polygon had a unique set of model parameters. We ran the model within each polygon until emissions plateaued and determined emissions in and by 2030 and 2050.</p>
        <p>We estimated the uncertainty of estimated SOC emissions using methods in ( 290) for transitions from perennial to annual crop cover. This methodology assumes different degrees of uncertainty for eastern and western Reporting Zones. The flux uncertaintywhich accounts for both "process uncertainty" (i.e. uncertainty associated with the way in which CENTURY was parameterized) and "situational uncertainty" (i.e. uncertainty associated with the range of conditions associated with each parameter set)was 54% in the eastern region and 78% in the western region. Because the eastern Reporting Zones ("Boreal Shield East" and "Atlantic Maritime") accounted for 26.7% of observed grassland conversion, we estimated an areaweighted flux uncertainty of 71.6%.</p>
        <p>We estimated additional emissions from biomass removal and oxidation. We considered carbon in all belowground biomass (roots of grasses, trees, and shrubs) as well as the aboveground biomass of sporadic trees (291) that overlapped with AAFC-mapped areas of representative grassland conversion. We assumed all biomass carbon was emitted in the year of conversion. Uncertainty for biomass was 156% and 109% for above-and belowground biomass respectively, based on pixel-level uncertainty within areas of mapped grassland conversion (291).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential in 2030 for avoided conversion of grasslands of 12.7 (2.2 to 41.3) Tg CO2e/yr, a potential that decreases through time to 4.1 (0.2 to 20.2) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. We projected total cumulative avoided emissions as 99.9 (15.4 to 340.6) Tg CO2e/yr by 2030 and 200.0 (38.3 to 620.2) Tg CO2e/yr by 2050. Our findings indicate large potential for mitigation from avoided grassland conversion in the western Prairies, where rates of conversion are the highest (Fig. S3).</p>
        <p>To estimate overall uncertainty, we used uncertainty around SOC and biomass loss, as well as around the area of conversion. We used a normal distribution for SOC, but a log-normal distribution for both biomass and area of conversion.</p>
        <p>For each CCS (Fig. S1) in which grassland conversion was identified, we assumed the estimated average rate of annual conversion (2011-2016) will be avoided during 2021-2030. This step resulted in ten differently aged cohorts of grasslands with avoided conversion, each with an area equal to the current extent of annual grassland conversion in that CCS. For each CCS, we obtained the present value (PV) equivalent of GHG mitigation through 2030 or 2050, respectively, by discounting the stream of avoided annual net GHG fluxes of each age cohort with avoided conversion through 2030 or 2050, respectively. We calculated the cost of each cohort by multiplying the average per-ha cost of lands in each CCS and the area in each cohort of avoided conversion. Using a 3% discount rate, for each CCS, we then converted these annual cohort costs to their PV equivalents (in 2021 at 2018 CAD) based on the years in which conversion was avoided for individual cohorts. We then estimated the MAC of avoided conversion in each CCS in 2030 and in 2050, respectively, as the summed PV cost of all avoided conversion cohorts of the CCS, divided by the sum of PV GHG fluxes of all avoided conversion cohorts in the CCS through 2030 and 2050, respectively. Finally, to calculate total potential GHG abatement through avoided grassland conversion in 2030 and 2050, respectively, at the CAD 10, CAD 50 and CAD 100/Mg CO2e price points, we summed the CO2e mitigation in 2030 or 2050, respectively, of all CCS with MAC of up to CAD 10, CAD 50 and CAD 100/Mg CO2e, respectively.</p>
        <p>These analyses indicated that most of the mitigation potential from avoided grassland conversion in 2030 will cost more than CAD 100/Mg CO2e, but 2.7 Tg CO2e/yr was available at less than CAD 100/Mg CO2e and 1.6 Tg CO2e/yr at less than CAD 50/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Increased sequestration of CO2 by restoring 30-m riparian buffers with perennial grasses in cropland areas with annual harvests</p>
        <p>Within the Prairie provinces, we estimated approximately 265,500 ha of riparian area currently used for crops could be restored to perennial grassland cover. To identify this area, we mapped agricultural areas (rangeland and cropland) with 2013 Canada Landcover data (150) and removed any areas of potential forest using the forest zones in (151) to avoid double counting with riparian tree planting. We created 30-m buffers around all streams, rivers, and lakes using CanVec topographic data (183) and included any additional area within 30-m of prairie pothole wetlands from Ducks Unlimited Canada (see sections on Freshwater Mineral Wetlands). These latter data were attributed with CLI class information from 1:250K Land Capability for Agriculture (152) to exclude areas classed as high productivity soils (CLI class 1-3).</p>
        <p>We then clipped this buffered area with the 2018 Annual Crop Inventory (153) to retain only cropland. We assumed that 10% of the total area of opportunity could be restored each year between 2021 and 2030, such that the full extent (265,500 ha) was restored to grassland by 2030. As a prescribed scenario, there was no uncertainty in the estimate for area of opportunity. For this restoration pathway, as well as the wetland restoration pathways (details below), we did not deduct historical restoration trends, given uncertainty around whether historical investments in restoration would continue.</p>
        <p>Grassland restoration can accumulate substantial amounts of CO2 in soil organic matter (292). We estimated carbon accumulation in the areas identified as suitable for restoration of perennial grasses. Similar to Avoided Grassland Conversion, we used the non-linear model of the Canadian Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Accounting and Reporting System (287) for conversion of annual to perennial crop cover and estimates of sequestration from grassland restoration at annual increments. Model predictions were based on distinct combinations of polygons that relied on Reporting Zone and texture polygons from Soil Landscapes of Canada (82), each associated with a unique set of model parameters. Within each polygon, we ran the model at an annual time step until sequestration rates plateaued to determine mitigation potential by and in 2030 and 2050.</p>
        <p>We determined uncertainty of SOC emissions for transitions from perennial to annual crop cover (290). Similar to Avoided Grassland Conversion, flux uncertainty was set as 78% and accounted for both process uncertainty associated with parametrization of the CENTURY model as well as situational uncertainty related to the range of conditions associated with each parameter set.</p>
        <p>We estimated rates of sequestration for grasslands by province. Considered over annual increments, sequestration rates were highest in the year immediately following the year in which restoration was initiated and then tapered slowly throughout subsequent decades. As such, the mean annual sequestration rate in 2030 (2.55 tCO2e/ha/yr) was substantially higher than in 2050 (1.52 tCO2e /ha/yr). Our implementation scenario modeled 10% of the area of opportunity as restored each year between 2021 and 2030.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential in 2030 for restoration of grassland riparian buffers of 0.7 (-0.1 to 1.5) Tg CO2e/yr and 0.4 (0.0 to 1.8) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050. We projected total cumulative mitigation potential of 4.1 (-0.4 to 8.4) Tg CO2e by 2030, 14.0 (4.6 to 32.8) Tg CO2e by 2050. Uncertainty in these estimates stemmed from rates of SOC and biomass accumulation, which we fit with a normal and log-normal distribution, respectively.</p>
        <p>We assumed one tenth of the restorable area would be restored each year between 2021 and 2030 (a restoration 'cohort'). We multiplied the average per-ha cost of restorable lands in each CCS (Fig. S1) and the area in each restoration cohort to calculate the cost of each restoration cohort. We then converted these cohort costs to their PV equivalents (in 2021 at 2018 CAD) for each CCS based on the year in which a given cohort was restored using the 3% cost discount rate applied in all pathways. Annual net CO2e fluxes for each restoration cohort in each CCS were discounted to their PV equivalents using the 1% discount rate for carbon. We estimated the MAC of each CCS in 2030 and in 2050, respectively, as the summed PV cost of all restoration cohorts of the CCS, divided by the sum of all PV CO2e fluxes of all restoration cohorts in the CCS through 2030 and 2050, respectively. Finally, to calculate total mitigation potential through grassland restoration in 2030 and 2050, respectively, at the CAD 10, CAD 50, and CAD 100 per Mg CO2e price points, we summed the CO2e mitigation in 2030 or 2050, respectively, of all CCSs with MAC of up to CAD 10, CAD 50 and CAD 100 per Mg CO2e, respectively. These analyses indicated 60% (0.4 Tg CO2e/yr) of the 0.7 Tg CO2e/yr of mitigation potential in 2030 from restoration of grassland buffers will cost less than CAD 100/Mg CO2e, with 0.2 Tg CO2e/yr available at less than CAD 50/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Canada has 348 Mha of forest, which is more than 7% of global forest cover and comprises 24% of the world's boreal forests (293), with most forest land under provincial or territorial jurisdiction. For the purposes of reporting emissions and removals in the National Inventory Report (NIR) (19), this forest land is subdivided into managed (226 Mha) and unmanaged forest (122 Mha). The former is managed principally for timber, non-timber resources or ecological services, and includes areas with intensive fire suppression.</p>
        <p>This pathway includes increased sequestration of CO2 from a set of silviculture and harvest practices in managed forests that enhance carbon storage in the forest and harvested wood products pool. We estimated mitigation potential of improved forest management (IFM) by calculating carbon storage in all ecosystem pools and wood products, as well as substitution benefits of wood for energy and building materials and CO2e from changes in albedo. We compared the carbon dynamics between 1990 and 2050 for four scenarios that differed in forest regeneration, harvest cycles and wood utilization:</p>
        <p>1. Business-as-usual (BAU), reflective of current and projected forest management, 2. Conservation, a 10% reduction in harvest of old forest relative to BAU beginning in 2021 and converting that amount of forest area to conservation using the oldest stands in each management unit, 3. Conservation + regeneration, like Conservation but with a 10% increase in growth rates of forests regenerating after harvest, 4. Conservation + regeneration + increased wood utilization, like Conservation + regeneration but with the avoidance of burning post-harvest residues in the forest, use of up to 50% of harvest residues for bioenergy, as well as an increase in the share of longlived products in Canada's wood product mix at the expense of pulp and paper. We present the difference between the BAU and the fourth scenario as the principal scenario in the main text. steel and concrete, and avoided 2.1 Mg C and 2.2 Mg C emissions per 1 Mg C of sawnwood and 1tC of panels, respectively (77). We estimated bioenergy substitution benefits using a linear programming model that maximized avoided emissions by selecting from nine different candidate bioenergy facilities to substitute fossil fuel burning as per (297). We updated electricity fuel mixes to be consistent with forecasted electricity generation by fuel type in Canada, averaged over 2020 to 2040 (298). We considered bioenergy produced from mill and harvest residues in each of the IFM scenarios, incremental to the BAU scenario (see below for scenario description).</p>
        <p>We estimated the CO2e flux consequences of albedo-changes caused by forest harvest (i.e., changes in albedo from full forest to newly cleared forest to regrowing forest and from old growth conservation relative to BAU). To do so, we first modeled a 450-year time series for each yield curve to determine the proportion of maximum foliage biomass achieved per year as a proxy for canopy closure. We then joined the CBM-CFS3 model results with these time series by forest type and age and estimates of the warming or cooling associated with changes in albedo i.e., top-of-atmosphere radiative forcing (RF) converted to CO2e. Multiplying the proportion of maximum foliage biomass by the total RF value provided a cumulative RF for a stand at a given age. The difference in RF between adjacent years provided the year-to-year delta RF, which we added to NBP to derive net annual mitigation. We estimated CO2e from albedo-induced radiative forcing per ecoregion and IGBP land cover classification (61), assuming that the Open Shrubland IGBP class was representative of the albedo of newly cleared forest. Because the CBM-CFS3 model runs occurred at the RU level, we averaged CO2e flux values within each RU.</p>
        <p>The Business-as-usual scenario reflected historical forest harvesting (clearcut, clearcut with salvage, commercial thinning, young-stand thinning, slashburn following clearcut) as well as natural disturbance (wildfire and insects). We assumed 85-97% of the merchantable stem biomass was utilized at harvest and the residue left on site. Model projections ran from 2018 to 2050 (12). We projected harvest area per RU based on the average from 2005-2015, slashburn levels from the 2008-2017 average, and wildfire area based on the 2007-2017 average. However, we projected a 20% decrease in harvest levels in British Columbia between 2030 and 2050 as per (12). All scenarios had identical wildfire projections so that differences in the emissions between scenarios reflected management actions rather than changes in wildfire emissions. While insect disturbances are included in the historical model (i.e., 1990 to 2017), we did not project future insect disturbances as per (10), due to high variability in area and volume impacted.</p>
        <p>The Conservation scenario modeled changes in forest management beginning in 2021, focused on deferral of forest harvest in old growth stands. We modeled a 10% decrease in harvest relative to historical trends and we set aside for conservation a corresponding area on average, ~88,000 ha/yr of old growth (average stand age of 281 yr), for a cumulative total of 876,916 by 2030.</p>
        <p>The Conservation + regeneration scenario used the same parameters as Conservation, but included a 10% enhancement of forest yield in harvested areas. This enhancement in regeneration is possible via protection of advanced regeneration during harvest, planting of seedlings well-adapted to future growing conditions, and moderate fertilization. We modeled regeneration enhancement by increasing post-harvest yield curves by 10% relative to the BAU yield curves for a total area of 7.1 Mha by 2030.</p>
        <p>The Conservation + regeneration + increased wood utilization scenario used the same parameters as Conservation + regeneration, but included modelling of the mitigation associated with avoided burning of logging slash that would have otherwise been piled and burned onsite but used instead to produce bioenergy. From 2021 onwards, we modeled a 10% reduction of slash burning following clearcut (in regions with slash burning) and used up to 50% of postharvest residues for bioenergy production. In three jurisdictions with low-emissions electricity grids (British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario), we modeled lower residue recovery rates of 25%, 10% and 10%, respectively, to reflect the lower substitution benefit of bioenergy. In this scenario, we also modeled the mitigation resulting from changes in forest product commodities towards long-lived forest products, i.e. shares of sawnwood and panels were increased (6% and 3% respectively) and shares of pulp and paper were decreased by 9%, starting in 2021.</p>
        <p>Other potential IFM approaches with implications for mitigation, including retention harvesting practices, low impact harvesting, enhanced thinning, fire and fuel management, extended rotations and other site-specific opportunities (299) were not included in our study.</p>
        <p>In 2030, we estimated the Conservation scenario could provide 4.1 (-19.4 to 27.6) Tg CO2e/yr (95% CI shown in parentheses here and below), the Conservation + regeneration scenario 5.9 (-17.6 to 29.4) Tg CO2e/yr, and the Conservation + regeneration + increased wood utilization scenario 7.9 (-15.6 to 31.4) Tg CO2e/yr. By 2030, the three scenarios produced cumulative emission reductions of -17.2, -8.6, and -9.7 (-95.3 to 381.3) Mt CO2e, respectively (Fig. S5).</p>
        <p>To characterize uncertainty around these estimates, we relied on Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) based on methods in (300). Sources of uncertainty included model algorithms, parameters, and input data. In brief, linear models relating the standard deviation to the mean value of a given model indicator from these results were used to predict standard deviations for the same indicator from its value, as observed in the present study. In this case, the three indicators of interest were Net Biome Productivity (NBP), transfers from the ecosystem to harvested wood products, and changes in albedo. For differences between scenarios, standard deviations were calculated assuming errors in the baseline and the scenario followed a multivariate normal distribution with strongly (90%) correlated errors. A high error correlation was assumed because only small areas of the land base are treated in the NCS scenario relative to the BAU. The standard deviation for emissions from harvested wood products was assumed to be proportional to the error for transfers to harvested wood products from the ecosystem. For product displacement, the high and low scenarios were assumed to bound a uniform distribution. For energy displacement and albedo forcing, we modeled error using a triangular distribution. For albedo, we estimated uncertainty based on average radiative forcing per ecoregion and land cover transition across four radiative kernels. The standard deviation for the sum of all these factors was estimated by combining them using MCS.</p>
        <p>We analyzed costs related to implementation of the Conservation + regeneration + increased wood utilization following methods in (76,77). These studies estimated spatially and temporally disaggregated costs of climate change mitigation to 2050 involving forest management and wood use for Canada (76) and British Columbia (77). We used these analyses to infer the proportion of total mitigation available at different cost levels. We used estimates of cost per unit CO2e from (76) for similar activities in the same Reconciliation Unit (RU) as a proxy for the activities examined here.</p>
        <p>We assumed a linear relationship between strategy implementation and accompanying mitigation outcomes with implementation costs so that the cost per unit CO2e does not change if implementation levels change. This assumption allowed use of published estimates of mitigation costs (76, 77) for the different implementation levels described here. We assumed the cost estimates for different activities included in the pathway are additive so cost estimates can be combined to represent the whole pathway. For the RUs where no cost per unit CO2e estimates were available in (76), we used estimates from RUs within the same province or territory or, if not available, from the same ecozones. While mitigation from substitution effects was included in the total mitigation potential for the IFM pathway, no economic impacts on industries that are substituted were included in the cost estimates due to lack of such considerations in (76). Therefore, the cost estimates in the MAC curve for IFM may be underestimated when substitution provides more mitigation (i.e. substitution for other industries increases), or conversely overestimated when more emissions occur (i.e. substitution for other industries decreases).</p>
        <p>For each RU, we scaled the estimates of cost per unit CO2e from ( 76) by the mitigation estimates here (Table 2). We assumed the ratio of mitigation impacts among different activities are maintained in the IFM pathway. We plotted the cost estimates against undiscounted average annual mitigation potentials at the RU scale to produce the MAC curve for the IFM pathway (Fig. S6).</p>
        <p>The cost analysis indicated the total mitigation cost for the IFM pathway would be approximately CAD 2.6B or approximately CAD 260M/yr on average, for the Conservation + regeneration + increased wood utilization scenario over 2021-2030. Most of the mitigation potential can be achieved by 2030 at less CAD than 70/Mg CO2e and the mitigation potential more than doubles by 2050 at a similar cost (Fig. S6).</p>
        <p>Avoided CO2e emissions from preventing anthropogenic conversion of forest to non-forest land use across all forests in Canada. This pathway does not include areas where harvesting is expected to be followed by forest regeneration and there is no land-use change.</p>
        <p>Most forest cover loss in Canada represents temporary clearings due timber harvest, forest fire, disease or pest outbreak (49,301). However, land-use change from forest to nonforest reduced Canada's forest area by 0.4% (1.4 Mha) between 1990 and 2017, with the rate falling from 54,000 ha/yr in the 1990s to 39,000 ha/yr in 2010-2017 (293). In the 2010-2017 period, most forest conversion stemmed from mining, oil and gas development (33%), followed by agriculture (31%), built-up areas (industry, transportation, municipal, recreation: 18%), hydroelectric infrastructure and reservoirs (14%) and forestry roads (4%). These estimates include conversion in both managed and unmanaged forests, consistent with Canada's international reporting (19). We estimated future conversion at an average rate of 30,689 ± 2,085 ha/yr (± SD) for 2021-2030 as per Canada's Fourth Biennial Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (11), based on a business-as-usual scenario using available information of drivers, policies, practices and future development.</p>
        <p>Our estimate for this pathway assumed complete avoidance of conversion for agriculture on the basis that improvements in agricultural efficiency and changes in diet can mitigate negative impacts on food production or leakage (i.e., conversion shifting elsewhere). We did not include conversion for hydropower development, given its net neutral to positive climate impact (302) and the need for emission-free power generation to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in Canada. We assumed a 50% reduction of other types of forest conversion, given the infeasibility of avoiding all conversion related to economic or urban development or infrastructure needs. We thus estimated the mitigation potential of avoiding conversion of an average forest area of 20,143 ± 637 ha/yr (± SD). While we only model avoided conversion for 2021-2030, we estimated annual avoided emissions to 2050.</p>
        <p>At the RU level, we modeled three fluxes: avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from forest conversion, avoided loss of forest carbon sequestration ("forgone sequestration"), and avoided changes in albedo due to land-cover change. We did not account for risk of wildfire or pest disturbance in unconverted forests.</p>
        <p>We estimated avoided GHG emissions using an empirical model based on sector and region of conversion, methodologically consistent with Canada's NIR (19). Avoided emissions include immediate GHG emissions from burning biomass during conversion, residual emissions over time as biomass left on-site decays, and emissions over time from the decay of harvested wood products, based on provincial production mixes. The standard deviations associated with immediate, residual, or harvested wood products emissions from conversion ranged from 14.2-20.0%. We did not model non-biogenic carbon fluxes (e.g. from machinery in forest conversion).</p>
        <p>For avoided loss of forest carbon sequestration, spatially detailed data on future forest conversion are not available. We assigned forest conversion by RU and sector to specific ecoregions (103) based on an assessment of where the greatest share of conversion occurred. We assigned pre-conversion IGBP cover classes (61) of evergreen needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, mixedwood, and young (generally assumed to be mixedwood for our analysis) by RU and sector based on deforestation monitoring data. We also assigned conversion to four post-conversion cover types based on IGBP cover classes: barren ground (conversion for mining, oil and gas, transportation and forestry roads), cropland, grassland, and urban and built-up (conversion for industry, municipal and recreation). We quantified the avoided loss of carbon sequestration for these ecoregion and forest type assignments as the average net ecosystem production at ages 20 to 40 years for the young pre-conversion forest type and 60 to 90 years for the other forest types.</p>
        <p>We accounted for albedo in the year of conversion. We applied estimates of avoided albedo change expressed in terms of kg C/m 2 for each relevant ecoregion using three preconversion IGBP types: evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and mixed forest and the four IGBP post-conversion cover classes. We adjusted albedo changes to reflect assumptions about proportion of maximum foliage biomass as a function of stand age, consistent with the pathways for improved forest management and restoration of forest cover. Our projected forest conversion data do not distinguish between forests converted for crops versus forests converted for pasture, but most conversion for agriculture in Canada occurs for pasture (19), so we assigned 25% of the forest conversion to cropland and 75% to pasture.</p>
        <p>In 2030, we estimated avoided forest conversion could provide up to 3.8 (3.0 to 4.5) Tg CO2e/yr and 26.3 (24.0 to 28.7) Tg CO2e cumulatively between 2021 and 2030. An additional 37.0 (36.5 to 37.5) Tg CO2e in cumulative avoided emissions occurs between 2031 and 2050. We accounted for uncertainty in our analysis using error propagation as per (303). This approach assumes errors are normally distributed, independent, and have coefficients of variation &lt; 0.3. Error distributions of our input data result from prior modelling for Canada's NIR (19), which imposed symmetrical or approximately normal errors. We expect no correlation in error distributions across these independent efforts, except for error correlations in sequestration and emissions data, both of which rely on underlying input data from the CBM-CFS3. We confirmed that coefficients of variations were &lt; 0.3.</p>
        <p>Our cost analysis focused on agriculture, which accounts for 58% of the avoided emissions in the pathway and is relatively easier to assess. Other avoided conversion (e.g., urban development, non-renewable resource extraction, transportation infrastructure) results from a wide range of economic, demographic, regulatory and other factors, and we assumed that the cost of avoiding it will be greater than CAD 100/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Each observation in the MAC curve represents the cost of avoiding conversion for agriculture in a RU as the sum of the opportunity cost of not converting and the avoided expenses related to forest clearing (Fig. S6). We defined opportunity cost as the agricultural land value (Fig. S1), estimating an average value across CCS that contain both forest and agricultural land in each RU. Forest clearing costs can be substantial and are generally higher in eastern Canada. For conversion to cropland, we had information on forest clearing costs including land development costs (e.g. bush clearing, rock picking and raking, ploughing, herbicide use) and the cost of one-time fertilization to bring the land to a productive state for agriculture. We calculated that the average clearing cost for crop and grazing lands is approximately CAD 2,000/ha and 2,500/ha in western and eastern Canada, respectively. We did not include the value of the cleared biomass upon conversion or the value of an unconverted forest for timber because we assumed that these values cancel out. We also did not include costs for management of unconverted forests, such as for thinning, or pest and fire control activities.</p>
        <p>To produce the MAC curve for agricultural-driven forest conversion (Fig. S6), we summed and discounted costs for each RU and divided by the discounted cumulative avoided GHG emissions to calculate the cost per tonne. Approximately 2.3 Tg CO2e per year by 2030 or about 97% of the total mitigation from avoided conversion to agriculture could be realized below CAD 50/Mg CO2e, and about 1.7 Tg CO2e per year or 75% of the total mitigation can be achieved with up to CAD 10/Mg CO2e. We assumed that the 1.9 Tg CO2e per year from avoided forest conversion to non-agricultural uses would have a cost beyond CAD 100/Mg CO2e by 2030.</p>
        <p>This pathway includes conversion of non-forest (&lt;25% tree cover) to forest (&gt; 25% tree cover) where forests historically occurred and excludes planting of trees after forest harvest (a legal obligation in Canada). We calculated accumulation of carbon in all ecosystem pools, assuming implementation of a tree planting program across the area of opportunity for restoration of forest cover between 2022 and 2030. We discounted the mitigation benefit to account for changes in albedo due to land-use transitions from non-forest to forest. We did not quantify potential carbon losses associated with site preparation for planting.</p>
        <p>We identified all places where forests historically existed and then reduced that area through multiple filters to identify the final area of opportunity. To first identify areas that could naturally support forests, we used a map of Vegetation Zones of Canada ( 151), keeping all of Canada's 13 forested zones and converting this map to a 30-m resolution raster based on the 2010 North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) land cover map (304). We then removed areas that are not compatible with restoration of forest cover by filtering out all pixels classified as urban, water, or snow and ice in the NALCMS. The urban deduction also removed major roads and avoided double counting with the urban canopy cover pathway. Our analysis excluded tree establishment in grass-dominated biomes, because these plantings are often not successful (305) and can reduce biodiversity and ecosystem integrity ( 14).</p>
        <p>Next, we excluded all pixels with greater than 25% canopy closure in the National Forest Inventory Treed Land in Canada layer (306), since these areas already contain forest. This step avoided double counting with the IFM pathway. To further avoid double counting and remove baseline forest management and natural disturbances, we also excluded forest areas with temporary loss of forest cover through harvest or wildfire, removing all areas that experienced a burn or harvest event since 1984 (307). These areas do not represent additional opportunity to restore forest, since a recent analysis found that a high proportion of these post-burn and harvest landscapes return to forest (49). To avoid double counting with the wetland pathways, we excluded both treed peatlands and open wetlands using (308) and the NALCMS land cover map, respectively. To minimize the amount of mis-classified conifer upland, we excluded potentially treed peatland pixels with a probability threshold of 0.6 or greater (308).</p>
        <p>To avoid conflicts with food security and double counting with the agricultural pathways, we removed all areas classified as Canada Land Inventory (CLI) Class 1-3 lands, using the CLI mapping (1:250,000 Land Capability for Agriculture) (152). We retained croplands with more severe limitations (e.g., limited by stoniness, adverse soil, topography or other factors), defined as CLI Class 4-8 or O. Due to data gaps in the land capability maps for British Columbia, we further excluded any opportunities for restoration of forest cover within British Columbia's Agricultural Land Reserve (309) under the assumption this practice is infeasible in these protected agricultural lands (some of which are forested).</p>
        <p>We then combined this raster with the 30-arc second Canada3D digital elevation model (310) to exclude areas above the treeline, using (311) to determine a latitudinally appropriate treeline threshold. We then removed any areas smaller than 1 ha under the assumption that planting programs would prioritize larger patches of opportunity. We further removed all areas outside of the boundaries of Canada's managed forest under the rationale that they are remote and thus difficult to plant as well as have limited mitigation potential due to low potential growth rates, tree densities, and low albedo relative to snow cover. Finally, we excluded areas outside one km of existing roads as mapped by the National Road Network (312). Visual inspection of the remaining area suggested that many potential planting sites classified as forest in NALCMS have a substantial amount of existing forest cover. Therefore, we conservatively opted to exclude all areas classified as forest by the NALCMS, resulting in an initial area of opportunity for restoration of forest cover of 4.34 Mha, before adjustment for albedo (see below).</p>
        <p>We calculated carbon accumulation for restored sites using the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) (26), a spatially explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (294). We modeled a ramp-up period, such that 4% of the area of opportunity for restoration of forest cover was planted in 2022, 8.5% in 2023 and 12.5% per year thereafter to 2030 so that the entire area of opportunity (after the albedo deduction, details below) was planted by 2030 (Fig. S7). We modeled a 2022 start date and ramp-up of planting rates to reflect the time needed to build tree seed collection and nursery capacity for sufficient stocks of additional seedlings. We assumed planting effort would be sequenced so that sites with the greatest potential climate mitigation after 28 years (2022-2050) would be planted first and sites with the least mitigation potential planted last.</p>
        <p>We parameterized initial conditions in the GCBM based on the proportion of each NALCMS land cover across the area of opportunity: Cropland (73.3%), Closed Shrubland (13.8%), Grassland (12.5%) and Open Shrubland (0.4%). We matched these land-cover classes to the IGBP classes (61) to calculate albedo changes related to each land-cover transition.</p>
        <p>To determine an ecologically appropriate end condition, we determined, for each of Canada's ecoregions (103), the most common NALCMS land cover and the leading native tree species for that land cover based on relative species abundance from (306). These native species included Trembling Aspen (Populus tremuloides), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Red Pine (Pinus resinosa), Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), Black Spruce (Picea mariana), and White Spruce (Picea glauca). We used this information to select the yield curves used for modeling carbon accumulation and assign the IGBP land cover end condition for modeling albedo changes. For example, if an ecoregion was predominately evergreen needleleaf with Douglas-fir as the most common species, we used a yield curve for Douglas-fir as a proxy for the entire ecoregion. Yield curves were specific to each forest type, reconciliation unit, and soil order, but did not vary by site quality or other site-specific information. We assumed all carbon pools, except the slow soil carbon stocks (organic carbon in mineral soil), start at zero tonnes of carbon per ha (294). This modeling provided estimates of accumulation per year of total ecosystem carbon (NBP), which increased through time given standard age-dependent S-shaped forest growth curves and the increasing area of new forest over the window of planting implementation. We did not account for fluxes related to other vegetation present on site at the planting year, emissions from land clearing, or decomposition of existing biomass (other than decay of carbon in the soil pool).</p>
        <p>We also did not attempt to adjust growth curves based on future climate projections, because the net impact of climate change impacts may be neutral across landscapes and species (313). Further, we assumed that most impacts would occur beyond the 2021-2050 timeframe of this analysis. Finally, using appropriate seed stock for future climates can help alleviate some of the negative effects of climate change on forest growth (314). We also assumed successful planting and did not discount potential losses due to herbivory, animal browsing, insects, pathogens, drought or wildfires.</p>
        <p>We quantified albedo using the general methods described above. Multiple factors can influence the magnitude of albedo change from restoration of forest cover, including pre-planting and final land cover, snow cover, solar radiation and atmospheric transmission of shortwave radiation. The albedo change varies significantly across the landscape, and its radiative forcing is particularly strong in sunny, snowy areas when evergreen needleleaf forests are restored on former grassland or cropland. For example, a modeling study estimates that after accounting for albedo, the net benefit of restoration of forest cover with conifer plantations is 110 Mg C/ha over one rotation period in British Columbia compared to -30 Mg C/ha (i.e. net warming) in the rest of Canada (67). Recent modeling shows a range of outcomes, with some indicating a relatively modest albedo effect such that carbon sequestration from restoration of forest cover dominates the net climate impact, while others suggest the opposite (68,(315)(316)(317). We did not estimate the cooling contribution of secondary organic aerosols emitted by forests which partly offset the warming effects of albedo changes (318,319).</p>
        <p>Because land-cover change from restoration of forest cover occurs gradually, we modeled similarly gradual changes in albedo through time using the annual proportion of maximum foliage biomass in the stand as a proxy for canopy cover. For instance, for a site planted in 2022, the GCBM calculates foliage biomass and the percent of the maximum foliage biomass for the site. We assumed this percent of maximum foliage biomass reflected percent tree cover and percent of full RF in CO2e. This approach recognizes that canopy closure occurs well before maximum stand biomass is reached. We then subtracted the annual increase in RF in units of CO2e from the annual NBP to obtain the annual and cumulative net climate benefit of each restored site.</p>
        <p>As a final step, we excluded all areas where cumulative mitigation in 2050 was less than zero. This final exclusion resulted in an area of opportunity for restoration of forest cover of 3.8 Mha (Fig. S7). This estimate is conservative in that it excludes areas with relatively slow growth rates, where cumulative mitigation is expected to be positive only past 2050. At an average density of 1650 trees/ha (18), this area of opportunity represents the planting of 6.1 billion trees.</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential for restoration of forest cover of 0.05 (-2.0 to 2.0) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 24.9 (-11.5 to 61.0) Tg CO2e/yr in 2050 (Fig. S8). By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative mitigation is -2.9 (-5.6 to -0.1) Tg CO2e and 242.7 (168.2 to 317.1) Tg CO2e, respectively. Important opportunities for restoration of forest cover were found in southern Ontario and Quebec as well as central Alberta (Table 2, Fig. S7).</p>
        <p>Uncertainty for mitigation estimates of restoration of forest cover was derived from MCS based on available plot level studies, e.g. (320). From these results, a model relating the standard deviation of NBP to mean estimated NBP was derived (SDNBP = 0.261-0.181 MEANNBP) and used to approximate the per hectare standard deviation of NBP for the observed NBP. Where required, errors were combined using ordinary error propagation to determine errors for annual or cumulative values for the area of opportunity for restoration of forest cover. For albedo, we again used the average change in radiative forcing per ecoregion and land-use transition across four radiative kernels.</p>
        <p>Each observation in the MAC curve for restoration of forest cover represents a CCS (20). We calculated the total cost over the period (TC) in each CCS as:</p>
        <p>where OC is the opportunity cost per ha in CCSi and TS is the area of forest cover restored in that spatial unit each year. PC represents implementation costs. We assume planting of local, non-fast-growing trees so we do not model future forest harvest, because the relatively short project period would limit merchantable timber. We discounted and divided total cost by the cumulative discounted GHG mitigation to 2050 to determine the cost per unit CO2e.</p>
        <p>We estimated implementation costs related to operational processes to enable successful tree planting, including costs related to site preparation, seeding and handling, planting, and tending/maintenance. We estimated site preparation costs as CAD 700/ha and tending costs as CAD 600/ha based on the average costs provided by provinces and territories for the Low Carbon Economy Fund Program and Pan-Canadian Framework, as well as (18). Seeding costs ranged from CAD 900/ha in evergreen needleleaf forests to CAD 2000/ha in deciduous broadleaf forests, with mixed forests intermediate in cost. In evergreen needleleaf forests, we estimated planting costs to be CAD 730/ha with machine planting on slopes less than 10 degrees and CAD 1200/ha on slopes greater than or equal to 10 degrees. Similarly, for mixed forests, costs ranged from CAD 865 to 1100/ha depending on slope, whereas for deciduous broadleaf forests we used CAD 1000/ha throughout.</p>
        <p>To feasibly estimate opportunity costs, we assumed restoration of forest cover occurs on marginal farmland or on lands with similar opportunity costs to marginal farmland. We estimated the opportunity cost for restoration of forest cover as equal to the forgone value of land as marginal farmland plus the forgone option value -the value stemming from the ability of landowners to retain options for changing the use of this marginal land in the future. We approximated the opportunity cost and forgone options value of the marginal land using the average net present value of annual rental expenses (see Materials and Methods).</p>
        <p>For forgone agricultural land values (CAD/ha), we used the discounted sum of annual average rental payments over an infinite period divided by the total rental farmland area as a proxy, as per (321, 322). We assumed the real annual average rental payment per hectare does not change over time (321) such that the unit value of the land remains the same over time.</p>
        <p>In terms of mitigation costs, the MAC curve for the period to 2030 is much steeper than the curve for 2050 (Fig. S6) because most of the mitigation will not be realized until late in the modelling period while all the cost occurs upfront. Specifically, more than 8 Tg CO2e/yr can be achieved by 2050 on average below CAD 100/Mg CO2e, or greater than 25% of the total CO2e mitigation. About 5 Tg CO2e/yr and 3 Tg CO2e/yr can be achieved between the ranges of CAD 50-100 and 10-50, respectively, while only 0.06 Tg CO2e per year can be achieved below CAD 10/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>Increased sequestration of CO2 through expansion of urban canopy cover via new and replacement plantings of urban trees.</p>
        <p>This pathway examined additional carbon storage in aboveground and belowground biomass through expansion of urban canopy cover from current levels (24%) to 36% across Canada's population centers (i.e., centers with at least 1000 people and 400 inhabitants/km 2 ). We separately assessed the area of opportunity for seven land-use categories with different canopy covers, mortality rates, management requirements, development pressures, and costs. These categories included (i) industrial and resource areas, (ii) commercial areas, (iii) institutional areas such as university or school properties, (iv) recreation areas or parks, (v) streets and roads, (vi) natural areas such as forest patches or remnants, and (vii) other unclassified areas such as undeveloped and marginal areas. For all but the latter two categories of land use, we assumed trees were individually managed, open-grown trees rather than stands of trees (i.e., natural areas).</p>
        <p>To determine the area of opportunity, we estimated current canopy cover in urban areas based on estimates from (323) by ecozone (103). That study (323) examined 86 population centers with at least 30,000 inhabitants. We included additional analytical steps to estimate cover from individually managed trees versus natural areas, and from different land uses, including streets as a separate land-use category. To estimate canopy cover by land-use category, we used census and land cover data (324) to determine, per ecozone, the total area in each category of land use. We then allocated an estimate of percent canopy cover per land use based on an assessment of 73,078 random points of urban canopy across Canada (323). Using the canopy assessment points and total street area by land-use class in Ontario, we found that street canopy cover is 14% on average, but ranges from 5% in commercial areas to 18% in parks and natural areas. We then extrapolated estimates of street area and total street canopy cover by scaling street canopy percentages by land-use area per ecozone. For smaller population centers (between 1,000 and 30,000 individuals) in the Prairies, Maritimes, and Mixedwood plains, we assumed canopy cover per land-use category was the same as in larger population centers in the same ecozone.</p>
        <p>We excluded urban communities from Hudson Plains, Northern Arctic, Southern Arctic, Taiga Plain and Taiga Shield East ecozones (0.3% of the total urban area considered here), due to natural limits on tree growth and data limitations. Since there were no large population centers in the Boreal Cordillera nor canopy estimates available by (323), we estimated its current urban canopy cover based on the overall average across Montane Cordillera Boreal Shield and Boreal Plains ecozones: 9% canopy cover in industrial areas, 11% in commercial areas, 12% in institutional areas, 20% in residential areas, 29% in parks, 14% along streets, 43% in natural areas, and 54% in other unclassified areas. In total, we estimated urban tree canopy covers 414,304 ha with an average canopy cover of 24%.</p>
        <p>To estimate the number of trees lost per year, we multiplied mortality rates by estimates of tree density per canopy. Data on tree density per canopy per land use came from field data and urban forest sampling in Ontario (325) and found estimates ranging from 125 trees/ha in residential and industrial areas to 1303 trees/ha in natural areas (n = &gt;1000 field plots). Based on these estimates, we assumed 7,309,976 trees are lost each year and that replanting these between 2021 and 2030 is equivalent to restoring 142,280 ha of urban tree canopy. The most-cited drivers of loss were poor planting and maintenance and damage from cars or vandalism. Because of the high mortality of trees within the first five years of planting (326), we assumed these annual mortality rates applied to individually managed trees in both the current and newly established canopy.</p>
        <p>To estimate the potential expansion of urban canopy cover, we assumed areas with industrial land use could increase urban canopy cover to 30%, commercial to 20%, institutional to 25%, natural to 60%, parks to 40%, residential to 28%, and streets to 20%. We applied these tree cover goals uniformly across ecozones, except in the Pacific Maritime where we assumed parks and residential areas maintained their existing 52% and 29% tree cover, respectively, and the Atlantic Maritime, where we assumed natural areas and residential areas maintained their existing 61% and 32% tree cover, respectively. We used the same canopy cover goals for Prairie and non-Prairie ecozones, based on the rationale that urban tree cover in Prairie cities typically increases through urbanization (327) and tree irrigation in arid cities can be minimized through the use of species tolerant of low soil moisture (328). In total, achieving 36% canopy cover (629,020 ha) would require maintaining the existing canopy and gaining an additional 210,695 ha of canopy.</p>
        <p>Our implementation scenario assumed initiation of tree planting in 2022 to allow one year of nursery growth and preparation time, and that planting occurred in nine equal-sized annual cohorts during 2022-2030. Because this scenario represents potential expansion, we did not incorporate the area of planting opportunity into uncertainty calculations.</p>
        <p>We estimated urban trees capture 2.12 ± 0.34 Mg C/ha of canopy cover/yr (mean ± SD), derived from urban tree measurements in the United States and scaled downwards for Canada's shorter growing season (323,329).</p>
        <p>This rate estimated carbon capture per hectare of full tree canopy cover, so we assumed planted trees reach full canopy cover at age 35 and scaled the rate to account for the small initial crown area of planted trees. Based on 10 commonly planted species of urban trees (330), we estimated that the average crown diameter (diametercrown, m) since time of planting (years) was: diametercrown = 0.311 ± 0.137 (± SD) × years + 2.645 ± 0.658 (SD).</p>
        <p>We then modeled carbon accumulation, assuming three-year-old trees were planted with an average canopy area of 3.2 m 2 . We reduced the sequestration estimates by 3.0 ± 0.6% (mean ± SD) to account for emissions related to tree planting and maintenance (331,332).</p>
        <p>For each land-use category, we calculated the number of additional trees needed to achieve the identified potential increases in urban tree canopy. This calculation was the product of the average number of trees per ha of tree canopy in each land-use category (i.e. industrial and resource areas: 125 trees/ha; commercial: 178; government-institutional and parks and recreational areas: 258; open areas: 1303; residential areas: 125; other areas: 187; and roads, 178) and the potential increase in canopy area identified under each land use. We also calculated, for each land-use category, the estimated additional trees to be planted annually to offset annual mortality of newly planted and currently existing trees, based on urban tree mortality rates in (326).</p>
        <p>Trees near buildings and residential structures can substantially reduce energy use for cooling and heating, even at Canadian latitudes (333,334). However, in high-latitude cities, tree placement relative to residential structures is a crucial determinant of tree impacts on net energy use of buildings; for instance, large trees along a building's southern exposure can increase annual net energy use (335,336). Since detailed mapping of tree planting sites relative to residential structures would be needed to assess the impact of increased urban tree canopy on residential energy use, we did not include these effects and associated impacts on emissions. We also did not incorporate albedo given the highly variable effects of urban canopy cover on air temperature and the complexity of urban energy balances with a typically ameliorating effect of urban trees on microclimates that counterbalance their albedo effects (53,54,337).</p>
        <p>Based on the above, we estimated an annual mitigation potential for expanded urban canopy cover of 0.2 (0.1 -0.6) Tg CO2e/yr in 2030 and 1.6 (1.1 to 2.2) CO2e/yr in 2050. By 2030 and 2050, our estimate of cumulative emissions is 0.9 (-0.4 to 2.2) Tg CO2e and 18.5 (9.8 to 27.2) Tg CO2e, respectively. Uncertainty estimates stem from variation around the rate of carbon sequestration (323, 329), rate of canopy expansion (330), and associated planting emissions (331,332). We fit each parameter with a normal distribution, except for the rate of canopy expansion which was better fit with a log-normal distribution.</p>
        <p>We assessed costs of increasing urban canopy cover based on different types of existing land use, focusing on the size of the planting stock, planting implementation (commercial vs. non-profit), maintenance intensity and type of installation (turf, planter or paver). For plantings in residential areas, parks and institutional areas, we assumed a 1:3 ratio of coniferous to broadleaf trees, based on a sample of over 250,000 trees in residential and institutional areas in Ontario (unpublished data). We assumed all trees in recreational, residential, park and institutional areas, open area and 'other' land-use categories, alongside 90% of street trees, are planted directly into the soil, while trees in industrial and resources and commercial land-use categories and 10% of street trees are planted into planters or pavers. For all land-use categories except open area, residential and other, we estimated costs for tree stock (CAD 182/tree), installation directly into soil (CAD 549/tree) or into planters or pavers (CAD 3,507/tree) including labor, mulching and cages as well as costs for post-planting maintenance (CAD 28/tree in years one and two following planting) based on prices from (338) inflation-adjusted to 2018. For residential trees, we used the full-service (yard consultation by arborist and full planting service) cost for 1-m tall evergreen (CAD 150) and 2-3-m tall broadleaf (CAD 220) trees from the Toronto LEAF program (339), but doubled to CAD 300 and CAD 440, respectively, to account for the approximately 50% municipal subsidy reflected in these planting costs. For trees planted in open area and 'other' land-use categories, we assumed an average cost of CAD 1,752/ha (340).</p>
        <p>For street trees and trees in recreational, residential, parks and commercial areas, we assumed intensive management (including pruning) every seven years as per Toronto's Strategic Forest Management Plan (341), beginning in year nine, seven years after the second-year postplanting visit for tree maintenance. For trees in industrial, resource and institutional land-use categories, we assumed one post-planting pruning in year nine. For trees in industrial and resource and commercial areas, we assumed management costs of CAD 46 in a tree care year (i.e. nine, 16, and 23 years post-planting) for the average tree (i.e., including trees not pruned) in a cohort, based on average inflation-adjusted costs (342)(343)(344). For trees on governmentinstitutional, park and recreation areas and street trees, we used management costs of CAD 30 for the average tree in a cohort in a tree care year (345).</p>
        <p>We calculated marginal abatement costs of increases in urban canopy cover by land-use category as the ratio of the discounted sum of annual costs and GHG mitigation, through 2030 and 2050, using the 1% mitigation and 3% monetary discount rates applied for all pathways in this study. Based on the above, we found no mitigation opportunity for increasing urban canopy cover for less than CAD 100/Mg CO2e.</p>
        <p>1 Change from hypothetical no 4R implementation 2 Change from business-as-usual scenario</p>
        <p>We assessed opportunity for improved management across approximately 139 Mha of managed forest in Canada, as reported in the NIR for Canada (19). Two thirds of the managed forest are coniferous with predominantly even-aged stand management, whereas approximately 10% and 15% are broadleaf and mixed forest, respectively, where selection harvest and unevenaged stand management are common. We aggregated results by Reconciliation Unit (RU), which intersect Canada's jurisdictional boundaries with the ecozones of Canada's National Ecological Framework (103).</p>
        <p>We modeled forest carbon dynamics and their net balance (i.e., net biome productivity, NBP) across biomass, soil, and dead organic matter pools using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) (294). This model is temporally explicit and accounts for age-dependent trends in carbon accumulation and storage as forests change from young to old. We modeled carbon in harvested wood products using the Carbon Budget Modeling Framework for Harvested Wood Products (CBM-FHWP) (19). To parametrize the model for carbon stock and forest disturbance information, we queried the NIR from 1990-2017 (2017 was the most recent year of available data at the time of analyses) to select RUs with substantial harvesting activity (&gt;2% of the nation's volume) (n = 10): British Columbia Montane Cordillera, British Columbia Pacific Maritime, Alberta Boreal Plains, Saskatchewan Boreal Plains, Ontario Boreal Shield East, Ontario Boreal Shield West, Quebec Atlantic Maritime, Quebec Boreal Shield East, New Brunswick Atlantic Maritime, and Nova Scotia Atlantic Maritime. These RUs represent 92% of Canada's total harvested area and 91% of harvested volume.</p>
        <p>To develop growth and yield functions for the CBM-CFS3 at a national scale, we aggregated stand-level information from the NIR for each RU by site productivity and leading species (low, medium and high site productivity; dominant broadleaf or coniferous species). Each RU had between 15-21 aggregated groups. We area-weighted growth and yield curves to the dominant stand types by summing the stand area multiplied by stand volume and dividing by total area of the RU.</p>
        <p>We tracked carbon transferred from forest ecosystems to Harvest Wood Products (HWP) and bioenergy through manufacturing, export, use, and post-consumer treatment. We used the same historical commodity shares as in the NIR and the average value from 2007 to 2016 to project future commodity shares. We used default lifetimes for HWP: sawnwood and other industrial roundwood had a 35-year half-life, panels a 25-year half-life, and pulp and paper a 2year half-life (295). We assumed that post-consumer commodities were sent to landfills and instantly incinerated or used for energy and that ash generated from bioenergy was instantly emitted as carbon dioxide.</p>
        <p>We modeled the mitigation potential of two types of substitutions: replacing emissionsintensive building materials with solid wood products and replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy in stationary combustion facilities to produce heat or electricity. For the substitution benefits of solid wood products, we included emissions related to extraction, transportation of raw materials, and manufacturing as previously estimated for Canada based on assumptions of a series of enduse products (e.g. single-family homes and other buildings) weighted by consumption (77, 296). We assumed incremental wood products were used only in building construction to substitute for</p>
