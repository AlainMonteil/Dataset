The great potential of this thermometer can only be fully exploited if precision and accuracy are sufficient to resolve differences of a few degrees in formation temperatures. In addition, widely available reference materials that match the sample matrices are necessary so that data can be robustly compared across laboratories (Meier-Augenstein &amp; Schimmelmann, 2019). Currently the situation in the field of carbonate clumped isotope geochemistry is far from satisfactory. Published values for the ETH reference materials, the only carbonates that have been recently measured in many different laboratories worldwide, differ by up to 0.053‰ (see Bernasconi et al., 2018;Thaler et al., 2020 for recent comparisons). For paleoclimate applications, however, a repeatability across laboratories of 0.01‰ or better is a necessary goal for meaningful data comparison.

        <p>The data normalization scheme currently used in clumped isotope geochemistry of carbonates in many laboratories is based on the comparison of the composition of the CO 2 liberated from carbonates by reaction with phosphoric acid with that of a set of CO 2 gases with different bulk and clumped isotope compositions (Dennis et al., 2011). These gases are prepared either by heating CO 2 at 1000 °C (heated gases; HG) or by CO 2 equilibration with water at low temperatures (equilibrated gases at e.g., 25 °C, 50 °C; EG). By comparing the measured compositions with the theoretical predictions of the equilibrium thermodynamic abundance of multiply substituted isotopologues in heated and equilibrated gases (Wang et al., 2004;and updates in Petersen et al., 2019), the measurements are standardized to the scale that was named the "absolute reference frame" (ARF) by Dennis et al. (2011). In more recent publications, the ARF is often referred to as the "Carbon Dioxide Equilibration Scale" (CDES), a terminology introduced by Passey and Henkes (2012). This approach was designed to allow different laboratories to link their measurements to an internationally recognized scale firmly anchored to theory using relatively easy and established laboratory protocols to produce CO 2 standard gases of known isotopic composition. Early comparisons of Δ 47 CDES values for carbonates analyzed in different laboratories and corrected with HG/EG normalization were promising (Dennis et al., 2011). While Bonifacie et al. (2017) reported similar Δ 47 CDES values for nine dolomite samples covering a range of almost 0.4‰ measured both at Caltech and IPGP laboratories with HG/EG normalization, Spooner et al. (2016) found that carbonate standardization improved agreement between data they obtained on samples analyzed both at Caltech and WHOI laboratories, compared to when they were using HG/EG normalization. Such recurrent cases of poor interlaboratory reproducibility (see also Bernasconi et al., 2018;Thaler et al., 2020) suggest that there are still unexplained differences in the results among laboratories (see Petersen et al., 2019 for a recent review).The data normalization scheme currently used in clumped isotope geochemistry of carbonates in many laboratories is based on the comparison of the composition of the CO 2 liberated from carbonates by reaction with phosphoric acid with that of a set of CO 2 gases with different bulk and clumped isotope compositions (Dennis et al., 2011).

Possible reasons for the differences in slopes and intercepts of the Δ 47 temperature dependence have been widely discussed in the literature (e.g., Bonifacie et al., 2017;Daëron et al., 2016;Fernandez et al., 2017;Katz et al., 2017;Kelson et al., 2017;Kluge et al., 2015;Petersen et al., 2019;Schauer et al., 2016). Discrepancies have been attributed to analytical artifacts such as CO 2 -acid re-equilibration at different acid digestion temperatures (see Swart et al., 2019;Wacker et al., 2013, for a recent discussion) and to slight pressure imbalances between sample and reference gas (Fiebig et al., 2016). Other factors proposed to influence the calculated slopes of the calibrations are the limitations of the data sets used in the individual studies, in particular in terms of the number of samples and replicates and of the temperature range covered by the available samples (Bonifacie et al., 2017;Fernandez et al., 2017). However, the discrepancies in the intercepts of the calibrations, for example, between Kelson et al. (2017) and Peral et al. (2018), and a generally poor laboratory comparability remain problems that could be mitigated by using a more robust standardization method. Petersen et al. (2019), in a recent effort to resolve differences in calibrations, compiled raw data of a number of published temperature calibrations and recalculated them all in a consistent way using the revised IUPAC correction parameters to correct for the 17 O abundance (Daëron et al., 2016;Schauer et al., 2016). The goal was to test whether data processing differences and/or the use of consistent but incorrect 17 O-correction parameters in the calculations were the root causes of inconsistencies. The result of this study was that differences among calibrations were reduced but not eliminated by the recalculation, implying that other factors must be responsible for the remaining discrepancies. These differences have pushed many laboratories to use laboratory-specific calibrations performed with the same analytical approach, as they at least partially take into consideration possible procedural differences (Petersen et al., 2019). However, if a laboratory changes analytical procedures or has not generated a robust in-house calibration, this approach is problematic. Achieving an interlaboratory reproducibility at the level of accuracy necessary for meaningful interpretations of the observed variations is a requirement for Δ 47 thermometry to reach its potential as a mature analytical method with broad acceptance and quantitative usefulness.(intercept).

        <p>While the definition of the CDES was a major milestone (Dennis et al., 2011), a known problem with this approach is that while the CO 2 standard gases equilibrated at known temperature (HG or EG) can be confidently used for correction of mass spectrometric fractionations/nonlinearities and for effects of the purification procedures, they cannot account for the effects of the phosphoric acid reaction on the composition of the produced CO 2 . Among the factors responsible for discrepant calibrations and laboratory comparability, two important ones cannot be tested with a gas-based standardization: (1) the absolute value and temperature dependence of the phosphoric acid fractionation factor (see Petersen et al., 2019 for a recent compilation) and (2) possible CO 2 equilibration effects during acid digestion of the sample. Swart et al. (2019) presented evidence that equilibration of CO 2 with water or hot metal surfaces during phosphoric acid reaction and transfer of the CO 2 to the mass spectrometer could be a factor leading to the alteration of the apparent temperature dependence of clumped isotopes in carbonates and on the absolute value of calculated Δ 47 . As many laboratories use custom built extraction lines with different designs and volumes of tubing and of acid vessels, these factors are impossible to precisely quantify for each laboratory and may further contribute to interlaboratory discrepancies.While the definition of the CDES was a major milestone (Dennis et al., 2011), a known problem with this approach is that while the CO 2 standard gases equilibrated at known temperature (HG or EG) can be confidently used for correction of mass spectrometric fractionations/nonlinearities and for effects of the purification procedures, they cannot account for the effects of the phosphoric acid reaction on the composition of the produced CO 2 .

        <p>We propose that these issues can be circumvented if carbonates, which undergo the same acid digestion as the samples, are used for normalization instead of or in addition to gases, consistent with the principle of identical treatment of sample and standards (Carter &amp; Fry, 2013;Werner &amp; Brand, 2001). In addition, normalizing results to accepted carbonate reference material values, as is commonly done with conventional carbon and oxygen isotope analysis in carbonates, removes the requirement to precisely quantify acid fractionation factors at different temperatures (Bernasconi et al., 2018).We propose that these issues can be circumvented if carbonates, which undergo the same acid digestion as the samples, are used for normalization instead of or in addition to gases, consistent with the principle of identical treatment of sample and standards (Carter &amp; Fry, 2013;Werner &amp; Brand, 2001).

        <p>A carbonate standardization approach was introduced by Schmid and Bernasconi (2010) and improved by Meckler et al. (2014), with the following benefits: (1) the use of carbonates can more easily be fully automated, eliminating time-consuming and possibly error-prone manual preparation of CO 2 standard gases (equilibrated at known temperature) by individual users on separate extraction lines; (2) in some automated systems designed for the measurement of small carbonate samples (e.g., the Kiel Device), the heated and equilibrated gases had to be measured through a different capillary than the gases produced by acid digestion of carbonates with potential biases that would go unrecognized; and (3) in these same systems the equilibrated and heated gases are measured at constant ion beam intensity in bellow mode, whereas the samples are measured with decreasing ion beams in microvolume mode. These features argue in favor of carbonate standardization a priori, but it remains critical to assess a posteriori whether the results of this approach are as robust and accurate as expected and whether they significantly improve the interlaboratory reproducibility of Δ 47 measurements. Discussions at the Sixth International Clumped Isotope Workshop in Paris in 2017 led to the present interlaboratory comparison exercise (InterCarb) to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of a carbonate-based standardization approach as an alternative to the use of gas standards.A carbonate standardization approach was introduced by Schmid and Bernasconi (2010) and improved by Meckler et al.

        <p>The primary goal of this study was to test whether the exclusive use of carbonate reference materials as a substitute for heated and equilibrated gases can minimize interlaboratory discrepancies and provide an alternative to the measurement of heated and equilibrated gases for the entire community. This is particularly important because of the increasing number of laboratories using commercial small-sample automated devices which cannot easily be standardized using the HG-EG approach. The InterCarb exercise also provides an opportunity to define the best community-derived consensus Δ 47 values for the ETH standards of Meckler et al. (2014). Although these standards are already used in many laboratories, their current nominal Δ 47 values are based on measurements from the ETH laboratory only. The InterCarb exercise can similarly establish community accepted values for other common carbonate reference materials, some of which have been in use for several years, in order to provide the community with a self-consistent set of carbonate reference materials with a broad range of bulk and clumped isotope compositions.The primary goal of this study was to test whether the exclusive use of carbonate reference materials as a substitute for heated and equilibrated gases can minimize interlaboratory discrepancies and provide an alternative to the measurement of heated and equilibrated gases for the entire community.

        <p>The CO 2 gas-based standardization scheme for clumped isotope thermometry in carbonates relies on a set of CO 2 standard gases with different bulk compositions (δ 13 C and δ 18 O, leading to different δ 47 ), preferably chosen by the user to encompass the δ 47 values of unknown samples that have been (1) heated at 1000 °C to reach a near-stochastic distribution of all isotopologues, or (2) equilibrated with water at low temperature to reach equilibrium enrichments in the mass-47 isotopologues (Dennis et al., 2011). The heated gases, having a near-stochastic distribution of the heavy isotopes among all isotopologues, define the zero point of the CDES scale, through the assumption that at 1000 °C these gases achieve a Δ 47 = 0.0266‰, and the water-equilibrated gases define a second, generally higher point on this scale (e.g., at 25 °C Δ 47 = 0.9196‰).The CO 2 gas-based standardization scheme for clumped isotope thermometry in carbonates relies on a set of CO 2 standard gases with different bulk compositions (δ 13 C and δ 18 O, leading to different δ 47 ), preferably chosen by the user to encompass the δ 47 values of unknown samples that have been (1) heated at 1000 °C to reach a near-stochastic distribution of all isotopologues, or (2) equilibrated with water at low temperature to reach equilibrium enrichments in the mass-47 isotopologues (Dennis et al., 2011).

        <p>The theoretical values linking measurements to theory were calculated by Wang et al. (2004) and revised by Petersen et al. (2019). A wide range in δ 47 values of gases used for normalization is generally chosen to allow for accurate correction for an apparent dependence of Δ 47 on δ 47 , which is caused by inaccurate pressure-dependent background corrections on the m/z 47 collector observed on many instruments (Bernasconi et al., 2013;He et al., 2012). The large range in Δ 47 (i.e., 25 °C, 1000 °C), on the other hand, is necessary to correct for scale compression caused by processes of scrambling and molecule recombination in the source of the mass spectrometer or elsewhere in the sample preparation, transfer lines and/or the capillaries (Dennis et al., 2011;Swart et al., 2019). With properly chosen CO 2 standard gases with widely varying δ 47 values it is possible to cover the entire range of natural carbonate compositions, avoiding extrapolations in the δ 47 versus Δ 47 compositional space (Figure 1). Note that with measurement errors (typically no better than 0.010‰) being relatively large compared to the natural compositional range (less than 0.5‰; Figure 1), the large (0.9‰) difference in Δ 47 of the CO 2 standard gases minimizes errors introduced by uncertainties resulting from the measurement of HG and EG. Meckler et al. (2014) attempted to achieve a similar framework as the CO 2 gas-based standardization but with carbonate standards. They described four carbonates that were developed at ETH Zürich to serve as replacements for HG's and EG's and demonstrated that good long-and short-term reproducibility can be achieved using only carbonates for data correction. Bernasconi et al. (2018) (2020). The first three studies produced independent foraminifera-based the fourth a travertine and the fifth a synthetic carbonate-based Δ 47 -temperature calibration anchored to the same set of carbonate standards. These studies yielded statistically indistinguishable slopes and intercepts despite the use of independent sample sets and in the case of Peral et al. (2018), a different analytical system. In addition, a reanalysis of samples from five previous calibrations by Anderson et al. (2021) using carbonate standardization revealed no significant differences in temperature dependence of Δ 47 between the different sample sets. This, solved a long standing debate about variations in slope among calibrations A possible limitation of carbonate standardization is that available carbonates have a smaller range in δ 47 and, perhaps more importantly, a smaller range in Δ 47 values than what is achievable with heated and equilibrated gases. In some specific cases, standardization procedures require extrapolation to compositions that are not within the δ 47 -Δ 47 space created by carbonate standards (Figure 1). In addition, the range of Δ 47 values for carbonates is only on the order of 0.5‰ between 0 and 1000 °C. The smaller range in Δ 47 compared to HG's and EG's requires higher precision and also a larger number of replicates of both standards and samples. Daëron (2021) and Kocken et al. (2019) suggest ∼50:50 ratio of standard to sample replicates to keep standardization errors small.The theoretical values linking measurements to theory were calculated by Wang et al. (2004) and revised by Petersen et al. (2019). A wide range in δ 47 values of gases used for normalization is generally chosen to allow for accurate correction for an apparent dependence of Δ 47 on δ 47 , which is caused by inaccurate pressure-dependent background corrections on the m/z 47 collector observed on many instruments (Bernasconi et al., 2013;He et al., 2012). The large range in Δ 47 (i.e., 25 °C, 1000 °C), on the other hand, is necessary to correct for scale compression caused by processes of scrambling and molecule recombination in the source of the mass spectrometer or elsewhere in the sample preparation, transfer lines and/or the capillaries (Dennis et al., 2011;Swart et al., 2019). With properly chosen CO 2 standard gases with widely varying δ 47 values it is possible to cover the entire range of natural carbonate compositions, avoiding extrapolations in the δ 47 versus Δ 47 compositional space (Figure 1). Note that with measurement errors (typically no better than 0.010‰) being relatively large compared to the natural compositional range (less than 0.5‰; Figure 1), the large (0.9‰) difference in Δ 47 of the CO 2 standard gases minimizes errors introduced by uncertainties resulting from the measurement of HG and EG. Meckler et al. (2014) attempted to achieve a similar framework as the CO 2 gas-based standardization but with carbonate standards. They described four carbonates that were developed at ETH Zürich to serve as replacements for HG's and EG's and demonstrated that good long-and short-term reproducibility can be achieved using only carbonates for data correction.

        <p>Seven carbonate standards with a large range of δ 47 and Δ 47 values (Figure 1) were distributed among participating laboratories and analyzed, treating three carbonates as "anchors" (whose Δ 47 values are assigned a priori) and the remaining four as "unknowns" (whose Δ 47 values are unknown, to be determined by comparison with the anchors). Due to their relatively widespread use in different laboratories, the three reference materials ETH-1, ETH-2, and ETH-3 (Bernasconi et al., 2018;Meckler et al., 2014) were chosen as anchors. They are still available today in relatively large quantities (&gt;600 g), have been in use at ETH since 2013 and in many other laboratories for several years. Importantly, they have been thoroughly tested for homogeneity based on thousands of measurements in 80-150 µg aliquot sizes in different laboratories and no changes in composition have been noticed at ETH in the 7 years they have been in use.Seven carbonate standards with a large range of δ 47 and Δ 47 values (Figure 1) were distributed among participating laboratories and analyzed, treating three carbonates as "anchors" (whose Δ 47 values are assigned a priori) and the remaining four as "unknowns" (whose Δ 47 values are unknown, to be determined by comparison with the anchors).

        <p>As initially all reactions were carried out at 25 °C (Ghosh, Adkins, et al., 2006), the Δ 47 values have traditionally been reported for a 25 °C acid temperature. With the advent of automated extraction lines, reaction temperatures have been increased to 70 °C or 90 °C. To account for the temperature dependence of the acid fractionation factor (Guo et al., 2009;Petersen et al., 2019) and to project these results back to the original 25 °C acid reactions, various acid temperature correction values have been reported over time, based on experimental observations and/or theoretical predictions. Given that here seven out of 10 laboratories reacted carbonates at 90 °C, two at 70 °C, and only one at 25 °C, our redetermination of the Δ 47 values of ETH-1/2/3/4 relative to the CDES projected to 25 °C would rely substantially on the accuracy of these acid temperature corrections (which typically range between 60 and 90 ppm). For this reason, we report the Δ 47 values of CO 2 produced by reacting ETH-1/2/3/4 at 90 °C. With this choice the numerical effect of poorly known acid corrections is minimized because the data from 70 °C and 25 °C reactions have relatively little influence on the final, error-weighted average Δ 47 values (cf. statistical weights in Figure 2). We thus propose to break with tradition and define the nominal Δ 47 values of the anchor standards as those of CO 2 produced at 90 °C, providing the most robust relationship to the CDES.As initially all reactions were carried out at 25 °C (Ghosh, Adkins, et al., 2006), the Δ 47 values have traditionally been reported for a 25 °C acid temperature.

        <p>It should be stressed that the InterCarb experiment, by design, is not intended to grade the analytical performance of individual laboratories. Each participating laboratory (or mass spectrometer, in the case of laboratories with several instruments) was thus randomly assigned an anonymous identifying number. Within each laboratory, analyses were grouped in different analytical sessions defined by the participants themselves. An analytical session is generally defined by a time in which the behavior of the analytical system (preparation system, source tuning, backgrounds, isotope scrambling in the source) is considered to be similar. The database record of each analysis consists of a laboratory identifier, a session identifier, an analysis identifier, the name of the analyzed sample, the mass spectrometer model, the acid reaction temperature, the mass of the reacted carbonate, and background-corrected δ 45 , δ 46 , and δ 47 values.It should be stressed that the InterCarb experiment, by design, is not intended to grade the analytical performance of individual laboratories.

        <p>The observation that these changes in nominal values decrease as Δ 47 increases suggests a simple hypothesis to explain this discrepancy: in the original study of Meckler et al. (2014), the carbonate samples and the heated/equilibrated CO 2 gases experienced different analytical procedures. The HGs were measured as large samples at constant beam intensity through a different capillary than the carbonates, which were measured using the microvolume and a decreasing beam. The potential effects of partial re-equilibration for the heated gases in the gas preparation line or in the capillaries of the mass spectrometer could be significant whereas it would be minuscule for the gases equilibrated at 25°, leading to an overestimation of Δ 47 scale compression and thus of the stretching applied to the Δ 47 scale toward theoretical values. The observed changes in apparent ETH-1 and ETH-2 Δ 47 values may therefore simply reflect partial re-equilibration of heated gases at the time of measurements at ETH (and reported in Meckler et al., 2014), increasing their values in the original study by about 0.05‰ (Figure 3).The observation that these changes in nominal values decrease as Δ 47 increases suggests a simple hypothesis to explain this discrepancy: in the original study of Meckler et al. (2014), the carbonate samples and the heated/equilibrated CO 2 gases experienced different analytical procedures. The HGs were measured as large samples at constant beam intensity through a different capillary than the carbonates, which were measured using the microvolume and a decreasing beam.

        <p>It has been suggested previously that ETH-1 and ETH-2 should be indistinguishable in Δ 47 and close to stochastic distribution (Müller, Violay, et al., 2017). This is because Δ 47 values of ETH-1 and ETH-2, originally heated to 600 °C, were found to be higher by only around 0.006‰ from the same carbonates heated at 1000 °C to achieve stochastic distribution of the isotopes. However, additional test measurements in multiple laboratories of samples heated at &gt;1000 °C are necessary to confirm this observation.It has been suggested previously that ETH-1 and ETH-2 should be indistinguishable in Δ 47 and close to stochastic distribution (Müller, Violay, et al., 2017).

        <p>One laboratory (Laboratory F) did however observe a large difference in the value for ETH-1 and ETH-2, although their values of ETH-3 and ETH-4 are similar to other laboratories. The reason for these inconsistencies is probably due to the fact that ETH-1 was only measured four times with a limited number of HG/EG, and ETH-2 and ETH-4 were not measured in the same session. In addition, the laboratories with BERNASCONI ET AL. (Petersen et al., 2019) the smallest number of replicate measurements have uncertainties that are systematically larger (Table 1). These results highlight the importance of strict correction procedures in clumped isotope analysis. Sufficient replication of both standards and samples is critical and, if insufficient, offsets can arise when comparing results from different sessions. Due to these difficulties it is good practice to spread replicates of the same sample in different sessions over longer periods of time to obtain accurate results and follow a ∼50:50 standard to sample replicate ratio.One laboratory (Laboratory F) did however observe a large difference in the value for ETH-1 and ETH-2, although their values of ETH-3 and ETH-4 are similar to other laboratories.

        <p>Based on the results above, the difference between the average of ETH1/2 and ETH-3 is reduced by 0.028‰, thus leading to a compression of the scale by about 5.8% compared to the values reported by Bernasconi et al.

As a consequence, the slopes of published temperature calibrations produced with carbonate standardization (Bernasconi et al., 2018;Jautzy et al., 2020;Kele et al., 2015;Meinicke et al., 2020;Peral et al., 2018;Piasecki et al., 2019) will become slightly shallower, with more positive y-intercepts. If Δ 47 results from previous publications are also recalculated with the new standard values (see Section 3.4), however, changes in calculated formation temperatures will be negligible. For this reason, when comparing data from publications using old accepted values of the ETH standards for standardization (either those published by Meckler et al., 2014 or those recalculated with the IUPAC parameters by Bernasconi et al., 2018) to newer data, it is recommended to directly compare the reconstructed temperatures rather than recalculating Δ 47 . Full recalculation of old measurements usually requires the availability of the entire data set including standards and the same correction procedures (e.g., averaging methods) used in the original publications (but see Appendix A for an alternative calculation method).Based on the results above, the difference between the average of ETH1/2 and ETH-3 is reduced by 0.028‰, thus leading to a compression of the scale by about 5.8% compared to the values reported by Bernasconi et al.

        <p>The laboratory averages for the four unknowns show standard deviations of 0.011‰ for ETH-4 and IAEA-C1, 0.018‰ for IAEA-C2 and 0.024‰ for MERCK, the most extreme case of extrapolation (Table 3). Qualitatively, laboratories with stronger analytical constraints (i.e., better intralaboratory repeatability of Δ 47 measurements and/or greater number of analyses) generally converge toward the overall mean value for each sample (Figure 4). This suggests that the observed interlaboratory variability is largely due to random errors that can be alleviated by replication, even for laboratories with relatively large analytical errors on individual measurements. It is also notable that fully propagated analytical errors that take into account uncertainties in the standardization procedure can be substantially larger than the errors based on the uncertainty associated with sample analyses alone, which is what is generally reported in the literature. The increase in error is also related to intralaboratory repeatability and the number of standards measured. In addition, the error increases for unknown samples whose compositions lie outside the "anchor triangle" defined by ETH-1/2/3. This is illustrated by the increased scatter and errors associated with MERCK, the carbonate farthest from the "anchor triangle," consistent with the models of Daëron (2021) (see also Kocken et al., 2019).The laboratory averages for the four unknowns show standard deviations of 0.011‰ for ETH-4 and IAEA-C1, 0.018‰ for IAEA-C2 and 0.024‰ for MERCK, the most extreme case of extrapolation (Table 3).

        <p>As seen in Table 2, there are stark differences in the total number of replicate analyses and the typical Δ 47 reproducibility achieved in different laboratories. As a result, final uncertainties in the average Δ 47 values of unknown samples vary considerably (Figure 4). Interlaboratory variability is smaller among laboratories with small analytical uncertainties, and larger among laboratories with few replicate analyses and/or poor analytical repeatability. If we chose only laboratories that have provided data with average standard errors below 0.01‰ (Table 3), which is within the shot-noise limits of modern IRMS instruments, interlaboratory standard deviation (1SD) becomes ≤ 9 ppm for ETH-4 (N = 22), IAEA-C1(N = 15), and IAEA-C2 (N = 13) and ≤0.015‰ for MERCK (N = 11; with SE &lt; 0.0135).

        <p>In order to do so, we compute the "number-of-sigma" deviation obtained by each laboratory for each unknown sample, relative to that sample's overall weighted average value. For example, the sigma-deviation for sample ETH-4 and Lab01 is equal to (0.4477-0.4511)/0.0052 = -0.66 and that for MERCK and Lab13 is to previously reported ones. The dashed gray line is a linear regression through the new versus old values of ETH-1/2/3/4, whose extrapolation coincides with 25 °C equilibrated CO 2 but not with heated gases. Apparent changes in the ETH-1/2/3/4 values thus scale linearly with the Δ 47 difference between carbonate samples and 25 °C equilibrated CO 2 , suggesting that Δ 47 values of heated gases in the original study may have been biased by ∼ +0.05‰ through partial re-equilibration at room temperature between the quenching of heated CO 2 and its ionization in the isotope-ratio mass spectrometer source.

If the analytical errors reported in Table 3 are reasonably accurate, we expect the population of sigma-deviations among all laboratories to be distributed as the canonical Gaussian distribution (μ = 0; σ = 1), and we can test this prediction using established statistical methods such as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality (Massey, 1951). We carried out this test for two cases: only considering the error of sample replication (Figure 5, upper row) and second including the normalization error (i.e., the fully propagated error (Figure 5, lower row). If we neglect uncertainties arising from standardization (the "allogenic" errors of Daëron, 2021), the sigma-deviations are no longer normally distributed (p = 0.003, Figure 5 upper-left panel).

This observation underscores the necessity of sufficient replication to produce data of the quality that is required for meaningful interpretations. The number of necessary replicates to reach a target temperature uncertainty can be reduced by improving the external reproducibility of the measurements (see also Bonifacie et al., 2017;Daëron, 2021;Fernandez et al., 2017;Kocken et al., 2019).If we consider only laboratories with reported errors &lt;0.010‰ (1SE) which is a desirable goal for the application of clumped isotopes in paleoclimate reconstructions, the standard deviation of the result is ≤ 0.009‰ for the samples with no or moderate extrapolation from the compositional triangle defined by the anchors.

        <p>Spreading replicate sample measurements in time and over multiple analytical sessions should help avoid analytical biases. The number and distribution of standards in a measuring interval are also important parameters to improve reproducibility and reduce errors. This has been discussed in detail by Kocken et al. (2019) and Daëron (2021) who both concluded that carbonate standards with bulk and clumped-isotope compositions similar to those of unknowns should be analyzed with greater frequency than the other anchors, while preserving a minimal level of replication for each anchor. In this study, analyses were grouped in measurement intervals, and all data were processed assuming no short-term variation in the instrumentation. However, especially with "small sample approaches" (e.g., the Kiel device) relying on short (∼30-45 min) measurements of many replicates, one can observe short-term variations (e.g., Bernasconi et al., 2018, Figure 4). Thus a moving window correction with variable window size may be desirable in these cases, likely calling for specific error propagation procedures which remain yet to be defined.Spreading replicate sample measurements in time and over multiple analytical sessions should help avoid analytical biases.

        <p>Two important outcomes of this study are that acid reaction temperature and instrument and preparation line design are not a cause for differences among laboratories when standardization is based on carbonates. The lack of resolvable differences observed in our data set indicates that if preparation line differences affect Δ 47 measurements, standardization with carbonates corrects any such effects whereas HG-EG standardization may fail to do so (Swart et al., 2019). Thus, when using carbonate standardization, these factors can be ignored provided the carbonate standards cover a large range in Δ 47 . Thus, following the principle of identical treatment of samples and standards (Werner &amp; Brand, 2001) clearly reduces uncertainties compared to the use of HG/EG standardization. We have to consider, however, that acid digestion conditions (e.g., reaction times, temperatures) and the temperature dependence of phosphoric acid fractionation (Defliese et al., 2015;Murray et al., 2016;van Dijk et al., 2019) may differ with carbonate mineralogy, therefore possible effects on Δ 47 could be mineral-specific. For this reason, it would be highly desirable to produce reference materials for dolomite, aragonite, magnesite and siderite. For dolomite, three samples were proposed by Müller et al. (2019) as possible reference materials and are available upon request. Ideally it would also be desirable to anchor the measurements in a carbonate absolute reference frame by creating some carbonates with independently known clumped isotope compositions.Two important outcomes of this study are that acid reaction temperature and instrument and preparation line design are not a cause for differences among laboratories when standardization is based on carbonates.

Merk and ETH-4 are both very fine grained synthetic calcium carbonates, and it has been suggested that the oxygen isotope composition of such fine-grained carbonates could change with time due to exchange with atmospheric CO 2 (Qi et al., 2021). At the ETH laboratory different aliquots of ETH-4 have been in use since 2013 and no alterations of its oxygen or clumped isotope composition were observed. However we strongly recommend that all standards are stored in a desiccator to reduce the chance of alteration.The IntrCarb results suggest that after milling, these carbonates were homogeneous within these bottles, but we strongly recommend verifying that additional bottles purchased from IAEA and MERCK are identical to the ones tested here.

        <p>Standardization errors could be reduced to some extent by increasing the range of bulk composition of the anchor samples (e.g., as illustrated by Figure 1 of Daëron, 2021), especially when samples are measured that require significant extrapolation. A sample with an extreme bulk composition like MERCK would be a useful addition as an anchor, regardless of its Δ 47 value. While with a three-anchor system, two heated standards for normalization are not strictly necessary, a "heated MERCK" anchor in combination with ETH-1 would furthermore allow verifying the PBL correction with greater confidence and with less replication than with ETH-2 (keeping in mind that small quadratic components to PBL correction might introduce a significant bias over a δ 47 range of 60‰, e.g., Figure 7 from He et al., 2012).Standardization errors could be reduced to some extent by increasing the range of bulk composition of the anchor samples (e.g., as illustrated by Figure 1 of Daëron, 2021), especially when samples are measured that require significant extrapolation.

        <p>With InterCarb, the nominal values of the ETH standards are robustly linked to the CDES, as they are now based on the average results of 10 laboratories, and are not only based on the values determined at ETH in 2013. Some laboratories may still want to continue measuring HG and EG to keep established laboratory procedures and/or to cover ranges in bulk compositions that require large extrapolations. However, the results of InterCarb, and the discussions in the literature (e.g., Petersen et al., 2019) show that with the HG/EG approach there are still poorly understood interlaboratory discrepancies (as suggested by Figure 6) which are absent in the carbonate-based normalization (see Figure 5). For this reason, it is of paramount importance that several of the InterCarb reference carbonates are incorporated in the laboratory procedures to ensure interlaboratory data compatibility. The use of matrix-matched reference materials is necessary so that delta values can be unambiguously compared on a like-for-like basis (see Meier-Augenstein &amp; Schimmelmann, 2019 for a recent discussion).With InterCarb, the nominal values of the ETH standards are robustly linked to the CDES, as they are now based on the average results of 10 laboratories, and are not only based on the values determined at ETH in 2013.

        <p>For laboratories using large sample common-acid bath methodologies and preferring gas-based data correction, we recommend that in addition to HG/EG a minimum of two of the InterCarb reference materials (or in-house standards with values calibrated to ETH standards) should be measured within the same analytical sessions as the samples and used in the data correction scheme. We recommend choosing two standards with a large difference in Δ 47 , for example, ETH-1 and ETH-3 or ETH-2 and IAEA-C2, depending on the bulk composition of the unknown samples (see Figure 1). In the case of samples with very low δ 47 values, we additionally recommend the use of MERCK.For laboratories using large sample common-acid bath methodologies and preferring gas-based data correction, we recommend that in addition to HG/EG a minimum of two of the InterCarb reference materials (or in-house standards with values calibrated to ETH standards) should be measured within the same analytical sessions as the samples and used in the data correction scheme.

        <p>Currently Δ 47 data are reported for different temperatures of phosphoric acid digestion, mostly projected to 25 °C but also to 70 °C or 90 °C reactions, and generally labeled respectively as Δ 47CDES25 , Δ 47CDES70 , and Δ 47CDES90 , a terminology introduced in Bonifacie et al.

In the literature, phosphoric acid correction factors used by different research groups to convert results from 90 °C to 25 °C reaction temperatures have varied between 0.069‰ (Wacker et al., 2014) and 0.092‰ (e.g., Bonifacie et al., 2017), thus representing a significant source of uncertainty and confusion.Currently Δ 47 data are reported for different temperatures of phosphoric acid digestion, mostly projected to 25 °C but also to 70 °C or 90 °C reactions, and generally labeled respectively as Δ 47CDES25 , Δ 47CDES70 , and Δ 47CDES90 , a terminology introduced in Bonifacie et al.

        <p>The direct standardization to accepted values of solid phases, on the other hand, removes the need for a phosphoric acid correction, yielding results which are independent of the temperature at which the samples were reacted. In InterCarb this has only been tested for calcites, the mineralogy of all standards used here. Further studies are necessary in particular for dolomite and siderite, as these minerals require longer reaction times and there are contrasting findings in the literature on whether they require different phosphoric acid fractionations (Bonifacie et al., 2017;Müller et al., 2019;Petersen et al., 2019;van Dijk et al., 2019), possibly affecting the absolute values of samples with such mineralogies. Aragonite may also have a different phosphoric acid fractionation factor than calcite (Müller, Violay, et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the use of the InterCarb reference carbonates, allows for a consistent correction of instrumental effects and normalization to the I-CDES, independent of the mineralogy. Possible effects related to the longer reaction time remain to be tested, and require intercomparison samples of different mineralogy. In any case, for all calcites, carbonate standardization eliminates different phosphoric acid correction factors as a source of uncertainty and provides a consistent framework to report Δ 47 without uncertainties related to the reaction temperature.The direct standardization to accepted values of solid phases, on the other hand, removes the need for a phosphoric acid correction, yielding results which are independent of the temperature at which the samples were reacted.

        <p>For these reasons, we recommend that in the future, carbonate clumped isotope values should be reported relative to a carbonate reference frame uniquely defined by the absolute Δ 47 values reported in Table 1 for ETH-1, ETH-2, and ETH-3. Unknown samples may be anchored to this reference frame either (a) directly by comparison to ETH-1/2/3, (b) indirectly by comparison with several of the four other carbonate standards used here (Figure 4), or (c) by comparison with a set of in-house laboratory standards whose composition is well-constrained relative to the materials reported here. To clearly distinguish this data normalization scheme from previous ones the denomination I-CDES should be use, with the notation Δ 47(I-CDES) . This approach is analogous to the change from the PDB to the VPDB scale, which was accomplished by assigning a consensus offset of +1.95‰ between the original PDB reference material and the NBS19 carbonate. This was subsequently, albeit temporarily, improved by defining a second anchor point with the L-SVEC lithium carbonate standard (Coplen et al., 2006). We note that because the carbonate Δ 47 values in Table 1 are firmly anchored to the CDES scale via HG/EG measurements in multiple laboratories, the two scales are in principle equivalent. However, I-CDES has three major advantages: (1) it follows the principle of equal treatment of sample and standards; (2) it removes uncertainties related to fractionation effects due to different acid reaction temperatures and designs of the preparation lines; and (3) it is based on traceable, stable materials (calcium carbonates) that are widely available to interested laboratories. Furthermore, the results summarized in Figure 5 imply that I-CDES standardization yields consistent Δ 47 values independent of laboratory and/or analytical protocols, so that interlaboratory scatter is accurately predicted by the fully propagated analytical uncertainties computed within each laboratory. By contrast, this does not always seem to be the case for gas-based standardization to the CDES reference frame (Figure 6), suggesting the existence of poorly understood sources of interlab discrepancies in that approach. The broad availability of carbonate reference materials with widely varying bulk and clumped isotope compositions is an important step to help establish a worldwide equivalence among laboratories and help new laboratories establish and verify their analytical procedures.For these reasons, we recommend that in the future, carbonate clumped isotope values should be reported relative to a carbonate reference frame uniquely defined by the absolute Δ 47 values reported in Table 1 for ETH-1, ETH-2, and ETH-3.

        <p>The decision that Δ 47(I-CDES) values are reported for an acid reaction temperature of 90 °C implies that the I-CDES value of any given sample will be almost 0.1‰ lower than its Δ 47CDES25 values which is currently the most common convention used to report clumped isotopes. At first sight it may seem a disadvantage to lose the ability to intuitively compare new results to those obtained through different standardization approaches in the published literature. However, it will make it immediately obvious that I-CDES-normalized values cannot directly be compared to data standardized to the ETH-1/2/3/4 values reported by Bernasconi et al.

In such cases, the conversion may be simplified as a simpler affine transformation, akin to a more traditional two-point normalization (e.g., VSMOW-VSLAP standardization): Δ value predicted by Equation A.7 is then 0.445 ± 0.004‰, to be compared with the independently constrained values reported here in Table 1 (0.450 ± 0.002‰) and Table 3 (0.451 ± 0.001‰).Δ for any unknown sample based only on its old 47 Δ and δ 47 values (the latter being defined relative to VPDB-CO 2 and computed by applying an acid 18 O/ 16 O fractionation factor of 1.01025 to said sample). Importantly, this particular transformation applies to all data sets originally standardized in the reference frame defined by the "old" nominal values of ETH-1/2/3.

        <p>The above computation could also be performed using any arbitrary set of three carbonate materials whose (δ 47 , old 47 Δ , new 47 Δ ) values are known, provided that they span a wide enough range in δ 47 and Δ 47 . This is true even if the carbonates in question were not originally used to standardize the raw data, as would be the case for CO 2 -standardized measurements. In the case where only two suitable carbonate standards X and Y are available, an acceptable approach would be to neglect δ 47 effects (equivalent to setting the value of b to zero in Equation A.3) by solving the following equation:The above computation could also be performed using any arbitrary set of three carbonate materials whose (δ 47 , old 47 Δ , new 47 Δ ) values are known, provided that they span a wide enough range in δ 47 and Δ 47 .
