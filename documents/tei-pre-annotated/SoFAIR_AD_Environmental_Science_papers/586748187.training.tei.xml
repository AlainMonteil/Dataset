        <p>Agricultural expansion and intensification are key drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss (Diaz et al., 2019) as well as climate change (IPCC, 2019). Historically some agricultural practices supported biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services. Yet such practices have been increasingly abandoned or replaced by farming systems which maximize yields through unsustainable use of natural resources and at the expense of biodiversity and ecosystem services (Stoate et al., 2009). These processes are driven by socio-economic and technological forces but also supported by public policies. The European Union's (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP; see Box 1) shapes the EU's agricultural sector (Hodge, Hauck, &amp; Bonn, 2015) and supports a variety of practices contributing to wide-scale biodiversity loss (Gregory, Skorpilova, Vorisek, &amp; Butler, 2019;Pe'er et al., 2014Pe'er et al., , 2019;;Van Swaay et al., 2019), climate change (Alliance Environment, 2019), soil erosion (Orgiazzi et al., 2016) and land degradation (IPBES, 2018). CAP programmes that could counteract these developments have been insufficient and/or underfunded (Alliance Environment, 2019;Pe'er et al., 2019). Furthermore, the current CAP is ineffective and inefficient also in addressing the social and economic challenges (ECA, 2016;Pe'er, Lakner, et al., 2017). The CAP has undergone several reforms, partly aiming to enhance its environmental and social performance. Some positive outcomes have been described (Batáry, Dicks, Kleijn, &amp; Sutherland, 2015;Walker et al., 2018), yet effective measures are required to reverse negative trends (e.g. Pe'er, Zinngrebe, et al., 2017)-indicating the need of a much more fundamental change of the CAP to deliver on both environmental and socio-economic challenges. The CAP post-2020, as proposed by the European Commission in June 2018 (EC, 2018), acknowledges the need to address environmental and sustainability challenges and introduces a new Green Architecture and a delivery model that offers Member States (MSs) higher flexibility as to how they implement the CAP (see Box 1; Figure 1).

Key shortcomings include:</p>
        <p>• Continuation of subsidies through area-based 'Direct Payments' (in Pillar 1) with low levels of environmental requirements. Areabased payments are inefficient both with respect to farmers' income and environmental aims, and their recent 'greening' has achieved minimal change in agricultural practice and environmental performance -only &lt;5% of the area under greening has seen a change in management (ECA, 2017). Direct Payments are often passed on to landowners rather than benefiting those who manage the land (Hennig &amp; Breustedt, 2018;WBAE, 2018), and attempts to cap the maximum allowable payments, and redistribute the funds to address their highly inequitable distribution, are likely to remain unsuccessful (Matthews 2018a(Matthews , 2018b)). Moreover, the coupling of some Direct Payments to high-input production remains permitted despite strong evidence that Coupled Payments lead to market distortion (OECD, 2017), foster greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support practices with demonstrated negative impacts on biodiversity (Pe'er, Lakner, et al., 2017).• Continuation of subsidies through area-based 'Direct Payments' (in Pillar 1) with low levels of environmental requirements.

        <p>• Budget cuts for Rural Development Programmes (so-called Pillar 2), including Agri-Environment-Climate Measures (AECM). If designed and implemented well, these policy tools are the most effective in supporting pro-environmental farming practices (Batáry et al., 2015;Walker et al., 2018). Cutting the respective budgets, rather than reducing barriers to effective implementation (such as insufficient funding, high administrative complexity and insufficient incentives for uptake), are therefore counterproductive (CEJA et al., 2019).• Budget cuts for Rural Development Programmes (so-called Pillar 2), including Agri-Environment-Climate Measures (AECM).

        <p>• Misleading claims attached to insufficient climate action. The Commission's proposal states that 40% of the expenditures for Direct Payments and Support for Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) will be labelled as 'climate-friendly'. Yet these instruments are not systematically linked to any effective measure for greenhouse gas reduction or climate adaptation, thus lacking any justification of this statement. Instead, they even partly support practices and sectors with significant greenhouse gas emissions (Alliance Environment, 2019;Pe'er et al., 2019).• Misleading claims attached to insufficient climate action.

        <p>• A 'Green Architecture' with vague requirements allows MSs and farmers to choose unambitious ('light green') options. The Commission's proposal presents a new voluntary instrument ('Eco-Schemes') and a slightly expanded set of environmental conditions under 'Cross Compliance' for Direct Payments. The proposal also demands higher ambition from the MSs on the environmental performance compared to the current period (article 92 in EC, 2018).• A 'Green Architecture' with vague requirements allows MSs and farmers to choose unambitious ('light green') options.

        <p>However, the proposal fails to list concrete measures that are known as essential for biodiversity and environment and thus should be prioritized by MSs, such as maintaining and restoring small-scale landscape features (see Harvey et al., 2020), buffer strips, fallow land, high-diversity grasslands, and at the landscape level, viability of High Nature Value farmland regions (Navarro &amp; López-Bao, 2019).However, the proposal fails to list concrete measures that are known as essential for biodiversity and environment and thus should be prioritized by MSs, such as maintaining and restoring small-scale landscape features (see Harvey et al., 2020), buffer strips, fallow land, high-diversity grasslands, and at the landscape level, viability of High Nature Value farmland regions (Navarro &amp; López-Bao, 2019).</p>
        <p>While flexibility for MSs and farmers to make their own choices is valuable for developing context-specific solutions, the experience of past and current CAP cycles is that a lack of clear requirements and evaluation criteria encourages a 'race to the bottom' where MSs 'compete' for the lowest requirements for their farmers' Direct Payments (Heinemann &amp; Weiss, 2018;WBAE, 2018). The proposed 'performance bonus ' (article 123 in EC, 2018), which should incentivize MSs to meet their goals, may adversely fuel such a race by incentivizing MSs to set easy-to-achieve targets from the onset.While flexibility for MSs and farmers to make their own choices is valuable for developing context-specific solutions, the experience of past and current CAP cycles is that a lack of clear requirements and evaluation criteria encourages a 'race to the bottom' where MSs 'compete' for the lowest requirements for their farmers' Direct Payments (Heinemann &amp; Weiss, 2018;WBAE, 2018).

        <p>• Insufficient set of indicators (Annex I of EC, 2018). The planned 'output' and 'results' indicators basically monitor the administrative and financial implementation of the CAP. The proposed 'impact' indicators mostly describe farming structures rather than actual impacts. They are insufficient for an effective monitoring of the CAP objectives and instruments and provide little guidance for policy steering. For example, there is a lack of indicators on farm management, land-use and land cover, environmental parameters and the economic performance of farming households (Pe'er et al., 2019;WBAE, 2018). This stands in stark contradiction to the result-based principles that the future CAP is proposed to follow. Moreover, complex administrative burdens that are disproportionate to their simplistic contents, set major hurdles to ambitious environmental implementation by MSs (WBAE, 2019a(WBAE, , 2019b)).• Insufficient set of indicators (Annex I of EC, 2018).

However, without requiring proper risk mitigation measures, insurance may promote risk-prone behaviour, that is, disregarding avoidable risks (Goodrich, Yu, &amp; Vandeveer, 2020;Müller, Johnson, &amp; Kreuer, 2017).risk management tools (i.e. insurance; article 70 in EC, 2018) seems reasonable given the increased risks to farmers from market exposure, environmental degradation (partly due to overuse of resources) and climate change (especially extreme weather events such as heat, droughts and wildfires).
