        <p>The high pace of economic growth has posed many challenges. These challenges include depletion of natural resources, globalization challenges, and environmental degradation. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economies are rich in mineral resources. Economic globalization has put the MENA countries in the spotlight for the developed world. Despite the status of being a hotspot for mineral resource richness, there is limited research on the effect of natural resources and economic globalization on the environmental degradation of the MENA countries. This paper examines the effects of natural resource abundance and economic globalization on environmental quality by considering trade openness, urbanization, and economic growth from the year 1980 to 2018. We apply second-generation panel cointegration techniques along with continuously updated fully modified (Cup-FM) and continuously updated bias-corrected (Cup-BC) techniques. The findings show that natural resource abundance significantly improves environmental quality. Likewise, economic globalization also mitigates emissions levels in the MENA countries. In contrast, trade openness, urbanization, and economic growth significantly deteriorate environmental quality. The unidirectional link indicates natural resources and economic globalization create trade openness. The paper provides novel empirical evidence and policy recommendations for sustainable development goals.The high pace of economic growth has posed many challenges.

        <p>Humanity has faced the major challenge of climate change since the turn of this century. Climate change is linked to energy consumption and resultant greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) (Nathaniel &amp; Iheonu, 2019). Many environmental studies have highlighted the need to reduce GHGs, mainly carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, as CO 2 emissions make up the leading share of GHGs (Ahmed et al. 2019a).Humanity has faced the major challenge of climate change since the turn of this century.

        <p>Understanding the causes of growing CO 2 emissions and choosing appropriate mitigation strategies is critical for all countries; however, this subject is crucial for the MENA (Middle East North African) region due to its specific characteristics.Understanding the causes of growing CO 2 emissions and choosing appropriate mitigation strategies is critical for all countries; however, this subject is crucial for the MENA (Middle East North African) region due to its specific characteristics.</p>
        <p>The MENA countries have abundant natural resources and hold almost 6% of the global population, approximately 60% of the world's oil resources, and about 45% of the world's gas reserves. The MENA economies are a significant source of international economic prosperity because of the region's extensive petroleum and natural gas reserves (Kiprop, 2019). The domestic abundance of gas and oil resources, high energy consumption, and energy exports to meet global energy demands increase this region's significance and strategic importance. The economic development sustained by consuming massive natural resource reserves, such as oil and gas, has sparked industrialization, urbanization, and unsustainable agriculture activities in the region (Magazzino &amp; Cerulli, 2019).The MENA countries have abundant natural resources and hold almost 6% of the global population, approximately 60% of the world's oil resources, and about 45% of the world's gas reserves.

        <p>These conditions have created a severe challenge for the sustainable development of the region. Almost 85% of GHGs emissions in the region are caused by energy consumption and production. The region's emissions level is higher than the global average in nearly all countries (Charfeddine &amp; Mrabet, 2017). Moreover, the regional population is expected to double in the next 40 years (Magazzino, 2019).These conditions have created a severe challenge for the sustainable development of the region.

        <p>It could significantly increase natural resource exploration and intensify regional CO 2 emissions. In addition, rising regional energy demands, vulnerability to highly volatile energy prices, and the region's unique weather distinguish MENA counties from other nations. Despite significant economic development, the countries in this region have not completed the first industrialization stage, which is generally characterized by less sophisticated products requiring high energy consumption (Can &amp; Gozgor, 2017). Therefore, the region still relies on foreign countries for machinery and equipment. These nations also largely depend upon natural resource exports for their economic development. As such, interacting with other nations through economic globalization is crucial for this region.It could significantly increase natural resource exploration and intensify regional CO 2 emissions.

        <p>Therefore, this research explores the connection among natural resource abundance, economic globalization, and CO 2 emissions in the unique context of MENA countries. Natural resources consist of minerals, gas, oil, and forest resources. Balsalobre-Lorente, Shahbaz, Roubaud, and Farhani (2018) posit that natural resources discourage the use of certain high pollutant fossil fuels by decreasing their import and providing a viable option to switch to low pollutant energy resources such as natural gas. Some empirical investigations support this view. For example, Zafar et al. (2019b) indicate that natural resource has curbed environmental damage in the U.S., and similar findings were found in BRICS economies (Danish, Baloch, Mahmood, &amp; Zhang, 2019).Therefore, this research explores the connection among natural resource abundance, economic globalization, and CO 2 emissions in the unique context of MENA countries.

        <p>In contrast, Ahmed et al. (2020a) posited that natural resource abundance pollutes the environment as mining activities degrade the environment. A country's tendency to use ample high pollutant lowcost fossil fuels makes it unlikely to capitalize on abundant natural resources' environmental benefit. Similarly, Sarkodie and Adams (2018) concluded that deforestation, mining, and chain saw operations are leading sources of environmental pollution and natural habitat loss. (Shahbaz, Nasir, &amp; Roubaud, 2018). Governments in developing economies tend to promote economic development by offering relaxed environmental regulation and this phenomenon, which is known as pollution havens, increases environmental degradation associated with FDI (Shahbaz, Nasreen, Abbas, &amp; Anis, 2015). In contrast, investing in energy-efficient technology can support environmental sustainability (Zhu, Duan, Guo, &amp; Yu, 2016).In contrast, Ahmed et al.

        <p>Given this background, this study makes the following contributions to the literature. Firstly, it explores the nexus among natural resource abundance, economic globalization, and CO 2 emissions in the unique setting of MENA countries. To our best knowledge, previous studies have not investigated this complicated relationship in the MENA region, even though the region is blessed with natural resources, and economic globalization plays a critical role in the economic development of this region. The countries in the region are dependent on economic globalization not only to export natural resources but also to avail the technical capacity required for natural resource exploration. Secondly, this research employs an advanced panel data estimation method to mitigate the problem of crosssection dependence (CD). Traditional panel data techniques, such as fully modified least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic least squares (DOLS), assume no dependence among panel cross-sections. It means that a shock in one country/section does not impact other countries/cross-sections. However, due to globalization, economies are closely connected socially, politically, and economically. Therefore, this research uses continuously updated fully modified (Cup-FM) and continuously updated bias-corrected (Cup-BC) methods introduced by Bai, Kao, and Ng (2009) to generate robust and reliable findings. In addition to CD, the methodology used in the paper can also solve autocorrelation and endogeneity problems. Besides long-run analysis, the study used Dumitrescu and Hurlin test to check causality between variables for recommending appropriate policy suggestions.Given this background, this study makes the following contributions to the literature.

        <p>Some researchers have studied the relationships between natural resources and CO 2 emissions by applying different econometric methods for panel and time-series data. However, these studies have found mixed results for these two variables. For example, Balsalobre- They applied cross-sectional augmented autoregressive distributed lags (CS-ARDL) techniques, and the outcomes showed that natural resources increased CO 2 emissions while green investment contributed to improved environmental quality. However, applying the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) method, A. Khan, Chenggang, Hussain, Bano, and Nawaz (2020) used data from Belt &amp; Road Initiative (BRI) countries and found positive linkages between natural resources and CO 2 emissions. In contrast, I. Khan, Hou, and Le (2021) found that natural resources could control CO 2 emissions for the U.S. Wang, Vo, Shahbaz, and Ak (2020) assessed the effect of economic globalization on CO 2 emissions in the 1996-2017 period for the G-7 economies. That study investigated the role of natural resources and financial development plays in influencing CO 2 emissions. The empirical findings from CS-ARDL revealed that economic globalization, natural resources, and financial development lead to rising CO 2 emissions. Umar, Ji, Kirikkaleli, Shahbaz, and Zhou (2020) examined the linkage among CO 2 emissions determinants in China during the period from 1980 to 2017. Results estimated by FMOLS, DOLS, demonstrate that natural resources and economic growth positively affect China's CO 2 emissions, while globalization tends to boost environmental sustainability. The causality results show that natural resources, globalization, and economic growth contribute to CO 2 emission. 3 | THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, DATA, AND METHODOLOGYSome researchers have studied the relationships between natural resources and CO 2 emissions by applying different econometric methods for panel and time-series data.

        <p>This study explored how natural resources and economic globalization affect environmental sustainability in the MENA region. The unsustainable mining and excessive utilization of natural resources can increase environmental deterioration (Ahmed et al., 2020a).

In contrast, urbanization may alleviate pollution levels by promoting resource efficiency through train and bus-based collective transportation (Ahmed et al. 2019a).

Because of their capacity to produce accurate findings, even in the presence of CD, endogeneity, and autocorrelation, these methods are efficient for panel data compared to other estimation methods (Ahmed et al., 2020b). The techniques produce unbiased and reliable outcomes in the case of exogenous regressors. These estimation methods also address mixed I(1)/I(0) factors and provide robust results. Even when there is no endogeneity, these measures can predict consistent results (Bai et al., 2009).Researchers have used different econometric techniques to evaluate independent variables' effect on dependent variables, such as pooled ordinary least squares, GMM, and OLS. Each method has advantages and disadvantages and also depends on the nature of the data. These methods do not mitigate the problem of CD. This study applied the Cup-FM introduced by Bai and Kao (2006) and the Cup-BC estimation method for robustness Bai et al.

        <p>The Cup-FM estimation method maintains a constant limited model parameter distribution. Using simulations, the parameters are continuously updated (Cup) over time until they converge.

        <p>The Cup-FM and Cup-BC results do not indicate the direction of the relationship between the variables, which is vital for developing policy recommendations. As such, this research applied the Granger causality test of Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) to observe the causal relationship between underlying variables. This method yields two statistics: W and Z. The W statistics show the test averages while Z represents the standard normal distribution.

        <p>Table 3 provides the CD results and indicates cross-dependence between the variables; in other words, the study accepts the alternative hypothesis against the null hypothesis with respect to crosssection independence. This outcome reaffirms that most of the MENA countries are inter-connected in the globalized world.

        <p>Hence, due to spillover effects, the variables are cross-sectionally dependent. If we had not considered the CD, the outcomes might have been unreliable (Pesaran, 2004). After confirming the CD, the study examined the integrated level of variables. Table 4 indicates the CIPS and CADF test results and indicates that the variables have a mixed integration order. Table 4 indicates that all the variables, except natural resources, are non-stationary at the level and become stationary at the first difference at a 1% critical value of significance. Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) was also applied to determine each MENA country's breakpoint. This method was first developed by Bai and Perron (1998) to ascertain the structural breakpoint.Hence, due to spillover effects, the variables are cross-sectionally dependent.

        <p>Table 6 presents the structural breakpoints of each country and reveals many structural breaks. In particular, multiple structural break periods occurred in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2006. These breaks influenced both global shocks and local shocks for each selected country. After confirming the presence of the long-term association using the Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) panel cointegration test, we gauged the long-term relationship elasticities applying the Cup-FM and Cup-BC method. Multinational corporations can transfer their expertise in green technology to economies having strong environmental standards.

        <p>The coefficient value of trade openness is positive and significantly impacts CO 2 emissions at the 1% critical value. Production in these economies may use outdated technologies that are damaging to the environment, and the environment in these economies can contain significant levels of pollution caused by dirty factories. It means a rise in trade openness can increase CO 2 emissions under weak environmental regulations because of dirty manufacturing's competitive advantage. This study's findings are consistent with (Danish, 2020;Hakimi &amp; Hamdi, 2016) but not consistent with (Gardiner &amp; Hajek, 2020). In the case of urbanization, the coefficient also indicates a positive and significant effect with respect to CO 2 emissions, indicating that urbanization is harmful to environmental quality. It may be because these nations are not using environmentally friendly policies during urbanization. Urbanization influences the physical environment The study applied second-generation panel cointegration techniques and two tests for CD (Pesaran, 2004) and the Lagrange Multiplier (Breusch &amp; Pagan, 1980). CADF and CIPS unit root assessments were used to assess the stationary properties of analyzed variables in CD's presence. This study applied the DHGM cointegration method Westerlund and Edgerton (2008), and the long-term coefficients were calculated using the Cup-FM technique (Bai &amp; Kao, 2006).

        <p>We verified the presence of CD in the data. Moreover, the findings of the CIPS and CADF Pesaran (2007) unit root analyses found a mixed integration order of studied variables. The mixed integration of variables applies to the second-generation cointegration techniques. The long-run equilibrium between the variables was verified using the Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) cointegration method. All the variables are cointegrated with CO 2 emissions when there is no shift, a mean shift, and a regime shift, indicating significant structural breaks.We verified the presence of CD in the data.
