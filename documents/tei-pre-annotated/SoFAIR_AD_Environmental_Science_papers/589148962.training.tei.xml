        <p>We examine the effect of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the European stock markets. Because of increased political uncertainty, geographic proximity and the ramifications of the fresh sanctions imposed on Russia, the European stock markets tended to react negatively to this crisis. We find that on 21 February 2022, when Russia recognized two Ukrainian states as autonomous regions, European stocks incurred a significant negative abnormal return. Moreover, the negative stock price reactions continued in the post-event period. The magnitude of the stock price reactions to this crisis exhibits considerable variation across industries, countries and size of the company.We examine the effect of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the European stock markets.

        <p>The recent Russia-Ukraine crisis was exacerbated on 21 February 2022 when Russia recognized Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent states and mobilized Russian troops inside those two parts of Ukraine as peacekeepers. World leaders called the action the start of a war. Consequently, the United States, the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union (EU) started to impose economic sanctions against Russia. With 37.3% of Russia's total global goods trade in 2020, the EU was Russia's most important trading partner (EC, 2022). Russia supplied 27% of the crude oil, 46.7% of the solid fuel, and 41.1% of the natural gas imported by the EU (Eurostat, 2022).The recent Russia-Ukraine crisis was exacerbated on 21 February 2022 when Russia recognized Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent states and mobilized Russian troops inside those two parts of Ukraine as peacekeepers.

        <p>Because of the integrated nature of the Russian economy, particularly with the European countries, through the trade of oil, gas, food and raw materials, the increased geopolitical tension and subsequently imposed sanctions were likely to have an adverse effect on western economies as well as on the Russian economy. This motivates us to investigate how investors in the European stock markets responded to this event.Because of the integrated nature of the Russian economy, particularly with the European countries, through the trade of oil, gas, food and raw materials, the increased geopolitical tension and subsequently imposed sanctions were likely to have an adverse effect on western economies as well as on the Russian economy.

        <p>Prior literature investigating the link between political uncertainty and financial market performance finds that fear of political instability has a significantly negative effect on both the stock market return and the risk profiles of financial assets (see e.g., Dimic et al., 2015;Gemmill, 1992;Jones &amp; Banning, 2008;Kapar &amp; Buigut, 2020;Li &amp; Born, 2006;Mei &amp; Guo, 2004;Nippani &amp; Medlin, 2002). Using a number of international political crises, Berkman et al. (2011) demonstrate the importance of political crises in explaining both the mean and the volatility of stock market returns around the world. Using data from 49 emerging nations, Lehkonen and Heimonen (2015) also report an inverse relationship between political risk and stock returns. Dimic et al. (2016) demonstrate that political risk influences currency carry trade returns.Prior literature investigating the link between political uncertainty and financial market performance finds that fear of political instability has a significantly negative effect on both the stock market return and the risk profiles of financial assets (see e.g., Dimic et al., 2015;Gemmill, 1992;Jones &amp; Banning, 2008;Kapar &amp; Buigut, 2020;Li &amp; Born, 2006;Mei &amp; Guo, 2004;Nippani &amp; Medlin, 2002).

        <p>Among the studies of recent major political risk events, Smales (2017) documents a significantly positive relationship between political risk (the Brexit referendum) and financial market uncertainty. He et al. (2017) examine the economic cost of non-violent diplomatic disputes between mainland China and Taiwan, and show that political tension is related to a significant decline in the stock market return. They also find that anticipated future tension levels are related to reductions in current stock returns. Kapar and Buigut (2020) find that diplomatic and economic blockades on Qatar resulted in a substantial impact on stock market volatility in Qatar. Furthermore, Buigut and Kapar (2020) demonstrate that the blockade of Qatar had a considerable impact on stock markets in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, with the effects varying across different industries and countries. Finally, Bash and Alsaifi (2019) show that the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi has had a severely negative influence on the Saudi Stock Exchange's stock returns.Among the studies of recent major political risk events, Smales (2017) documents a significantly positive relationship between political risk (the Brexit referendum) and financial market uncertainty.

        <p>There are also studies that explore the economic consequences of geopolitical risk (GPR), which captures the uncertainty arising from the possibility of wars, terrorist acts and conflicts between nations (Caldara &amp; Iacoviello, 2022). Studies suggest that GPR has significant impacts on corporations and financial markets, as evidenced by the adverse effects on investment, employment and downside risks (Caldara &amp; Iacoviello, 2022), equity returns and bond spreads (Rigobon &amp; Sack, 2005) and volatility in the stock markets (Choi, 2022). In a recent study, Salisu et al. (2022) show that geopolitical threats (e.g., military build-ups, threats of war and terrorism) have a greater adverse effect on stock returns than geopolitical acts (i.e., the actual occurrence of adverse events). Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is viewed as part of a resurgent geopolitical competition among the world's great powers, 1 significantly increasing the geopolitical threats. Our study contributes to the literature by examining how European stock markets have reacted to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.There are also studies that explore the economic consequences of geopolitical risk (GPR), which captures the uncertainty arising from the possibility of wars, terrorist acts and conflicts between nations (Caldara &amp; Iacoviello, 2022).

        <p>The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is unique in nature, and differs remarkably from past political uncertainty and wars such as the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War in several important ways. First, although the Russian invasion of Ukraine is centred in Europe, it has triggered geopolitical risks and shaken the global economy. For example, the geopolitical risk index developed by Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) demonstrates that the geopolitical threat reached a peak level after the Russian invasion of Ukraine (see Figure 1). Moreover, the invasion is likely to impair financial intermediation and trade, raising concerns about slower economic growth and faster inflation around the world. As a result, the impact of this crisis is considerably broader and deeper than the impact of previous political events.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is unique in nature, and differs remarkably from past political uncertainty and wars such as the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War in several important ways.

        <p>The second notable feature is that this crisis has resulted in a slew of sanctions and restrictions against Russia being imposed by a number of nations. On our selected event date of 21 February, 2 the EU Council enacted restrictive measures against five individuals. 3 On 22 February, the US announced its first tranche of sanctions to limit Russian access to financial resources. 4 On 23 February, the European Council introduced a first-of-its-kind sanctions package. 5 On 24 February, European leaders agreed to impose additional sanctions against Russia in the financial, energy and transportation sectors, restrictions on dual-use goods, export controls, export financing and visa policies. Indeed, the number of sanctions against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine is higher than the number imposed after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Moreover, the sanctions levied against Russia in 2014 were primarily aimed at its dealings with Crimea and had no direct effect on Russia. Overall, because of the unprecedented recent sanctions, Russia has become the single largest target of global sanctions (see Figure 2). Finally, unlike the previous wars, the Russia-Ukraine crisis has disrupted the global supply chain. Given that Russia (Ukraine) is a major supplier of oil, gas, metals and fertilizers (wheat, sunflower oil and corn), this crisis has resulted in a reduction in the supplies of these commodities. Further, the embargo on Russian exports and Russia's refusal to allow foreign cargoes to transit via its waterways and airspace have disrupted the global supply chain, causing a sharp rise in commodity prices.The second notable feature is that this crisis has resulted in a slew of sanctions and restrictions against Russia being imposed by a number of nations.

        <p>We predicted that the Russia-Ukraine crisis had a negative effect on European stock markets through economic and political channels. The economic effect of the Russia-Ukraine crisis is evident because Russia is an integrated trading partner of European countries and a key producer and supplier of crude oil and natural gas, with pipelines feeding many parts of Europe. Moreover, European countries are highly dependent on Russia and Ukraine for food (e.g., wheat, corn, barley, maize, sunflower seed and sunflower oil), fertilizers and raw materials. 6 The disruption arising from the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the accompanying sanctions on Russia have already raised price levels, and this is likely to have a ripple effect on the European economy and corporate performance (Rigobon &amp; Sack, 2005). Therefore, the Russia-Ukraine crisis is likely to have an adverse effect on the share prices of European companies.We predicted that the Russia-Ukraine crisis had a negative effect on European stock markets through economic and political channels.

        <p>Further, the geopolitical risk and threats in the Eurozone have escalated as a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Because of their geographic proximity and economic linkages, European countries, as well as companies, are directly affected by this war. European countries have already absorbed over 6.8 million refugees from Ukraine. 7 Moreover, because of the considerable uncertainty about the duration of this war, the ultimate political and economic consequences of the crisis are unpredictable. 8 Thus, the heightened geopolitical threat in the Euro region is increasing investors' uncertainty and dampening business confidence (Caldara &amp; Iacoviello, 2022), with a depressing effect on stock prices. Overall, the invasion, which is the first of its nature since World War II in any European country, should have a significant impact on the European economy and geopolitics, resulting in negative stock price reactions to this crisis in the European stock markets.Further, the geopolitical risk and threats in the Eurozone have escalated as a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

        <p>We use firms belonging to the STOXX Europe 600 index, which represents publicly traded firms with large, medium and small capital from the major European countries, to conduct an event study to examine the stock market reactions to Russia's declaration of its recognition of two independent states in eastern Ukraine on 21 February 2022. Our findings demonstrate significantly negative average abnormal returns (AARs) surrounding the short-event windows (e.g., -3 to +3 days), except for the first day following the event (i.e., 22 February). Importantly, we observe 0.41% negative AAR on the event day, the highest drop in stock prices during the event windows. We also observe negative and significant cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) around the event days, preevent days and post-event days, providing strong evidence of the prolonged negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the European stock market. When we examine industry-level variation in the stock price reactions to the crisis, we observe that seven out of eleven industries (viz, the basic materials, consumer staples, financials, healthcare, industrials, telecommunications and utilities sectors) experienced negative and significant AAR on the event day. Moreover, while the consumer staples industry had the worst AAR on the event day, the energy industry experienced an insignificant positive AAR. In addition, the financial services industry witnessed the most severe effect across the event windows. We observe consistent significant industry-level variation when CAR is used in the analysis.We use firms belonging to the STOXX Europe 600 index, which represents publicly traded firms with large, medium and small capital from the major European countries, to conduct an event study to examine the stock market reactions to Russia's declaration of its recognition of two independent states in eastern Ukraine on 21 February 2022.

        <p>Furthermore, we observe a considerable country-level heterogeneity in the stock price reactions to the crisis. For example, while companies in the Netherlands incurred the most negative AAR, companies in the UK experienced a positive and significant AAR on the event day, and companies domiciled both in Denmark and in Switzerland had significant negative CAR around the event day and the pre-event period. Finally, we observe that the small-and medium-cap companies experienced more negative AAR (CAR) than the large-cap companies on the event day (around the event window).Furthermore, we observe a considerable country-level heterogeneity in the stock price reactions to the crisis.

        <p>Our findings contribute to the literature in several important ways. First, we extend the growing body of literature that examines how geopolitical risks and political events affect stock returns. While the majority of the prior studies show that political events have negative impacts on stock returns and volatility (Bash &amp; Alsaifi, 2019;Buigut &amp; Kapar, 2020;Choudhry, 2010;Rigobon &amp; Sack, 2005;Smales, 2017), some also suggest that there are positive effects (Guidolin &amp; La Ferrara, 2010), and others document a weak relationship between war events and market returns (Hudson &amp; Urquhart, 2015). Given these mixed findings, this is the first attempt to examine the stock price reactions to the Russia-Ukraine crisis in European countries. 9 Unlike prior studies (Choudhry, 2010;Rigobon &amp; Sack, 2005), our sample countries are not 'direct' participants in the war, although they are providing humanitarian and military support to Ukraine and imposing restrictions on Russia. We show that European stocks experienced significant negative abnormal returns when Russia recognized the two Ukrainian states as autonomous regions, and that this effect continued in the post-event period. Importantly, we document a prolonged negative reaction in the European stock markets to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Our findings contribute to the literature in several important ways.

        <p>Second, our study complements prior works that show that the sensitivity of stock prices to political uncertainties and geopolitics differs across industries (Boutchkova et al., 2012;Buigut &amp; Kapar, 2020). We show that some industries, such as the basic materials, consumer staples, financials, healthcare, industrials, telecommunications and utilities sectors, were particularly sensitive to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Interestingly, while prior studies show that the consumer staples sector is least affected by crises (Landier &amp; Thesmar, 2020), we find this sector to be the most affected during the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Second, our study complements prior works that show that the sensitivity of stock prices to political uncertainties and geopolitics differs across industries (Boutchkova et al., 2012;Buigut &amp; Kapar, 2020).

        <p>Third, our findings of considerable country-level heterogeneity in the stock price reactions to the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the European stock market extend the related literature (e.g., Buigut &amp; Kapar, 2020). Our findings suggest that country-level variation cannot be explained solely by geographic proximity to Russia or Ukraine; rather, the extent of trade and economic ties affect stock prices significantly. Finally, our findings may guide policymakers, managers and other key stakeholders in developing effective policies to mitigate the negative impacts of political uncertainty on stock markets.Third, our findings of considerable country-level heterogeneity in the stock price reactions to the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the European stock market extend the related literature (e.g., Buigut &amp; Kapar, 2020).

        <p>We collected daily stock prices of firms belonging to the STOXX Europe 600 index from Refinitiv Datastream database. The STOXX Europe 600 index represents firms with large, medium and small capital from European countries, and covers diverse industries. From the initial sample of 600 firms, we dropped 13 firms for which the daily stock price or market value data were not available for the entire estimation period. Thus, our final sample includes the stocks of 587 firms traded in European countries. Table A1 presents the distribution of our sample by industry, while Table A2 presents the sample distribution by country.We collected daily stock prices of firms belonging to the STOXX Europe 600 index from Refinitiv Datastream database.

        <p>This study employs the event study approach proposed by Fama et al. (1969) to investigate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on European stock returns. We use both parametric and nonparametric tests to investigate the significance of the market reactions over the event window. We incorporate a non-parametric test to study the effect of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the stock returns, in addition to two parametric tests, because prior studies suggest that parametric tests rely on distributional assumptions such as return normality, which tend to be violated in the case of daily returns. Moreover, Maynes and Rumsey (1993) and Corrado and Truong (2008) show that parametric tests yield erroneous results in numerous marketplaces. Other studies also provide evidence that a non-parametric test such as the Wilcoxon statistic is more powerful than parametric statistics (Barber &amp; Lyon, 1996). Therefore, we supplement our analysis with the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test to check the robustness of our results.This study employs the event study approach proposed by Fama et al.

        <p>Our event window ranges from the 25th trading day before the event date of 21 February 2022 to the 25th trading day following the event (i.e., [-25, +25]). We deliberately chose a long event window to ascertain whether the short-time impact of the event, if any, was subsequently reversed once the initial surprise of the invasion had subsided. To investigate the abnormal market return around the event day, we first estimate the following equation for each stock in our sample.Our event window ranges from the 25th trading day before the event date of 21 February 2022 to the 25th trading day following the event (i.e., [-25, +25]).

As a result, our estimation window dates from 1 February 2021 to 14 January 2022. We drop the days immediately leading up to the event day to control for information leaks before the event day, since the event was evident from the build-up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border and the reports in the media of potential sanctions if there was an invasion.where R i t , is the logarithmic daily returns of security i on day t, and R M t , is the market return on day t.

        <p>Table 1 presents the AAR of stocks belonging to STOXX Europe 600 index for each of the days in our event windows, and Figure 4 shows the trend over the 7 days (i.e., [-3, +3]) surrounding the event day. Figure 4 exhibits negative and significant AAR values on all these 7 days except the first day following the event (i.e., 22 February). The magnitude of the negative AAR values increases monotonically up to the event day, and is particularly significant for the 2 days before the event day. One possible explanation for this finding is that the news about the dispute and possible invasion was extensively covered by the major mainstream media worldwide. The US government also revealed intelligence reports about a possible Russian attack on Ukraine. This news was likely to alter investors' perceptions about the possible political crisis, causing the market to react adversely.Table 1 presents the AAR of stocks belonging to STOXX Europe 600 index for each of the days in our event windows, and Figure 4 shows the trend over the 7 days (i.e., [-3, +3]) surrounding the event day.

We find that seven out of the eleven industries (viz., the basic materials, consumer staples, financials, healthcare, industrials, telecommunication and utilities sectors) experienced negative and significant AAR on the event day. Moreover, while the consumer staples industry had the worst AAR (-0.90%) on the event day, the energy industry experienced an insignificant positive AAR.Table 3 examines how the stock prices in different industries in the European stock markets responded to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

        <p>Although the consumer staples sector is generally expected to be less sensitive during a downturn (Landier &amp; Thesmar, 2020), our (counterintuitive) findings are consistent with evidence that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already thrown global supply chains into turmoil, escalating concerns about global food security, rising production costs, delayed deliveries and other challenges for businesses attempting to move goods globally. 12 The significant negative reactions in the consumer staples industry thus point to the fact that investors perceive this sector to be adversely affected by a decrease in consumer spending due to higher inflation and lower disposable income, lower consumer confidence and soaring raw material prices. 13 Our finding is also consistent with the prior literature that demonstrates that food safety events have a short-term negative impact on the consumer staples sector (e.g., Seo et al., 2013). Interestingly, the negative stock market reaction in the consumer staples sector turned positive on some post-event days (e.g., Days +2, +4, +15, +25). 14 The energy sector's positive, albeit non-significant, market reaction on the event day is consistent, since this sector was likely to benefit from the unusually high spike in oil and gas prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine crisis.Although the consumer staples sector is generally expected to be less sensitive during a downturn (Landier &amp; Thesmar, 2020), our (counterintuitive) findings are consistent with evidence that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has already thrown global supply chains into turmoil, escalating concerns about global food security, rising production costs, delayed deliveries and other challenges for businesses attempting to move goods globally. 12 The significant negative reactions in the consumer staples industry thus point to the fact that investors perceive this sector to be adversely affected by a decrease in consumer spending due to higher inflation and lower disposable income, lower consumer confidence and soaring raw material prices. 13 Our finding is also consistent with the prior literature that demonstrates that food safety events have a short-term negative impact on the consumer staples sector (e.g., Seo et al., 2013).

Consistent with our earlier findings in Table 3, we observe that the financials, industrials, telecommunications, consumer staples and consumer discretionary industries experienced much greater negative CAR around the event day, 15 while the other industries exhibited a relatively mild or no effect. During the pre-event periods, industries such as financials, industrials, consumer discretionary, technology and real estate experienced negative CAR, while the financials, telecommunications and consumer staples sectors experienced negative CAR during the post-event window.

        <p>Table A4 in the appendix presents the industry-specific CARs for an extended period around the event Day ([-25, +25]). We find that the consumer discretionary industry had a severely negative market reaction in the extended period, particularly after the initial five days of the event. For example, the abnormal CAR of -8.38% for the [0, +10] window is more than double the magnitude of the market reaction of -4.02% for the full sample. The staggering negative market reaction persisted and reached its worst level for the [0, +25] window. We also observe a prolonged record of significant negative CAR for the consumer staples and financial industries during the post-event window. 16 Although energy stocks did not react significantly during the shorter horizon, they mostly posted positive abnormal returns during the extended post-event period. This result is not surprising, since energy firms benefited from oil and gas price hikes in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Further, while the healthcare, real estate and technology industries showed negative CARs during the pre-event period, they recorded positive CARs during the extended post-event period.Table A4 in the appendix presents the industry-specific CARs for an extended period around the event Day ([-25, +25]).

For example, Germany buys over half of its gas from Russia, France receives a quarter of its supply from this country, 18 while Russia is Switzerland's one of the largest trading partners. 19 Despite this, Germany suspended approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Moscow's activities on the event day. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europe is on the verge of entering an energy crisis owing to the continent's heavy reliance on Russian gas delivered via pipelines.Table 5 shows the country-specific AAR for the periods (-3 to +3 days) surrounding the event day.

        <p>Interestingly, while companies in the Netherlands had the most negative AAR, 20 companies in the UK experienced a positive and significant AAR on the day of the event. The extreme negative market reactions of the Dutch firms are reasonable because the Netherlands has a strong dependency on Ukraine for supplies of corn and vegetable oils, and on Russia for supplies of oil, natural gas, nickel and copper. In 2021, for example, Dutch imports from Russia were worth 18.4 billion euros. Of this amount, mineral fuels accounted for 87%, with crude oil accounting for more than 50% and natural gas and petroleum products accounting for the balance. 21 On the other hand, one possible explanation of the findings for UK firms is that half of that country's gas supply comes from domestic sources, with the rest imported mostly from Norway and Qatar. It is very likely that this has contributed to the financial stability of UK firms.

It is important to note that Spain is not a major customer of Russia, with Algeria and the United States being that country's largest trading partners. Although the Finnish companies did not react on the event day, they showed a significant negative response to the conflict immediately following the event day (i.e., +1). Moreover, companies domiciled in the UK exhibited a significantly negative AAR on the pre-event (-3 and -2) days and the post-event (+3) days. Finally, firms domiciled in Norway did not experience significant abnormal returns in any of the three event windows (results untabulated). This finding is consistent with Norway's position as the world's largest energy exporter. For instance, Norway supplies 35% of France's total supply of natural gas.Event day Post-event days Importantly, Spain experienced almost no effect on either the event day or during the postevent windows. It is important to note that Spain is not a major customer of Russia, with Algeria and the United States being that country's largest trading partners. Although the Finnish companies did not react on the event day, they showed a significant negative response to the conflict immediately following the event day (i.e., +1). Moreover, companies domiciled in the UK exhibited a significantly negative AAR on the pre-event (-3 and -2) days and the post-event (+3) days.

        <p>We present the country-specific CARs for different short event windows in Table 6. A few observations are worth mentioning: (i) firms domiciled both in Denmark and in Switzerland had significant negative CAR during the days surrounding the event and in the pre-event periods, but registered non-significant CAR during the post-event periods; (ii) over the entire period, companies from Germany and the 'other countries' experienced significantly negative CAR; and (iii) stocks of firms domiciled in Italy, Spain and Norway remained completely unaffected during all three event windows. Figure 6 shows the differences in market reaction for different countries by comparing the country-specific CARs. 22 Table A5 presents the country-level CARs for an extended period. This shows that Finland, Germany and France suffered the worst in the post-event window, with negative abnormal returns of between -7.4% and -7.9% for these three countries for the [0, +10] event window. We observe similar negative CARs in the extended post-event windows for firms in the Netherlands. Interestingly, while Swedish firms exhibit significant negative CARs for the extended pre-event windows, they experienced positive CARs in the post-event periods ([0, +15] and [0, +20]).We present the country-specific CARs for different short event windows in Table 6.

        <p>22 Untabulated parametric analysis shows that firms in Austria experienced severe negative CARs of -4.10%, -11.92%, -17.29% and -21.94% for the [-1, 1], [-3, 3], [-5, 5] and [-10, 10] windows, respectively. The European Banking Authority (EBA) reports that banks from Austria, France and Italy have the highest direct asset exposures towards Russia, while Austrian, French and Hungarian banks have exposure to Ukraine.

        <p>Event windows The daily AARs for the large-, mid-and small-cap portfolios are reported in Table 7. When investigating the event day results, we find that the small-cap firms had the largest negative market AAR (-0.48%), followed by the mid-cap (-0.41%) and the large-cap firms (-0.34%). Moreover, during the pre-event windows, large-cap stocks remained largely unaffected, whereas both mid-and small-cap stocks exhibited some negative AARs. Finally, when we look at the post-event period results, we find that the mid-cap firms incurred a negative AAR on the +3 (-0.66%) post-event days, whereas small-cap firms experienced a negative AAR on the +2 (-0.47%) and +3 (-0.35%) post-event days.Event windows The daily AARs for the large-, mid-and small-cap portfolios are reported in Table 7.

        <p>Table 8 presents the CARs of the three size-based portfolios surrounding the event day. Consistent with the results for the AARs, we observe that the small-cap firms were most heavily affected by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, as evidenced by negative, significant and larger CARs, followed by mid-and then by large-cap firms. Interestingly, for the large-cap firms, the negative CARs are relatively larger during the pre-event period, suggesting that the market started to react to the threat of war during the pre-event period for the large-cap firms. However, for mid-and small-cap firms, we observe higher levels of (adverse) market reactions around the event day window. We report the results for the CARs for an extended period in Table A6 in the appendix. When we look at the extended post-event period results, we find that large-cap firms incurred significantly negative CARs in the [0, +10] and [0, +25] post-event windows, whereas mid-and small-cap firms incurred significant negative CARs in the [0, +10] post-event days.Table 8 presents the CARs of the three size-based portfolios surrounding the event day.

        <p>Overall, we observe considerable size-based portfolio-wide variations in the AAR and CAR surrounding the Russia-Ukraine crisis, underscoring the significance of portfolio-level analysis to understand the true stock market reactions in the European markets. We find that small and medium (large) firms were more (less) negatively affected by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, which is consistent with the extant literature that shows that small and medium firms are more vulnerable to political and epidemic crises (Miyajima &amp; Yafeh, 2007;Naidu &amp; Ranjeeni, 2021).Overall, we observe considerable size-based portfolio-wide variations in the AAR and CAR surrounding the Russia-Ukraine crisis, underscoring the significance of portfolio-level analysis to understand the true stock market reactions in the European markets.

        <p>In our final analysis, we examine whether geographical proximity has ramifications for the market reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Three of our sample countries (Norway, Finland and Poland) have borders with Russia, and only Poland has a border with Ukraine. These countries represent 41 of our sample firms (&lt;7% of the total sample). All these three countries are members of the European Union. It is important to stress that about half of our sample firms (287 out of 587 firms) are from the Euro area, and the rest (except for three firms from Bermuda, the Faroe Islands and the Isle of Man) are domiciled in Member States of the European Union. Thus, in general, all the countries in our sample have some degree of direct exposure to this war due to their geographic proximity and economic ties. Therefore, it is important to examine whether the sample firms from the three countries sharing borders with Russia and/or Ukraine exhibit asymmetric effects.In our final analysis, we examine whether geographical proximity has ramifications for the market reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

This severe negative return for Poland drives the results for 'other countries' in Figure 6. While Finland did not suffer as much as Poland in the short-run, Finnish firms incurred AAR of -1.08% on Day +1 and CAR of -2.43% over the [0, +3] period and -7.87% over the [0, +10] period. Interestingly, Norway had non-significant positive abnormal returns in the post-event period. This result is not surprising since oil-rich Norway is a NATO member and did not suffer any immediate political risk despite having a border with Russia. Instead, Norway benefited from rising energy prices. We combine firms from these three counties together, as the number of firms (other than firms from Finland) is insufficient for conducting a non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed-rank test.

Importantly, we observe -0.41% AAR on the event day, the highest drop in stock prices during the event windows. We also find a negative and significant CAR around the event days, pre-event days and post-event days, providing strong evidence of the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on the European stock market. When we look at industry-level variation in the stock price reactions to the crisis, we observe a considerable industry-wide variation in AAR and CAR surrounding the event period. Further, we observe that, while firms in the Netherlands had the most negative AAR, companies in the UK experienced a positive and significant AAR on the event day, and firms domiciled both in Denmark and in Switzerland had significant negative CAR during the days surrounding the event and the pre-event periods, suggesting a significant country-level variation in the stock price reaction to the crisis.

        <p>Our study indicates that, in general, investors have taken the Russia-Ukraine crisis very seriously. The wave of this political crisis is already echoing around the globe. If this war becomes a long one, it will have a serious impact on the global economy. Therefore, governments should act quickly to ensure financial stability in their respective countries. To improve investor confidence, policy actions such as fiscal, monetary, and other appropriate measures should be implemented. In the short term, policymakers in Europe should consider lowering their significant reliance on Russia for critical oil and gas supplies, and pursuing alternative energy sources while working towards long-term sustainability. The political crisis in Russia and Ukraine has once again pushed for a primary focus on renewable energy growth.Our study indicates that, in general, investors have taken the Russia-Ukraine crisis very seriously.
