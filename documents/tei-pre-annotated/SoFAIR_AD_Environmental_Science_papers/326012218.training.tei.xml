        <p>Storage of slurry is an important emission source for ammonia (NH 3 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) from livestock production. Therefore, this study collected published emission data from stored cattle and pig slurry to determine baseline emission values and emission changes due to slurry treatment and coverage of stores. Emission data were collected from 120 papers yielding 711 records of measurements conducted at farm-, pilot-and laboratory-scale. The emission data reported in a multitude of units were standardized and compiled in a database. Descriptive statistics of the data from untreated slurry stored uncovered revealed a large variability in emissions for all gases. To determine baseline emissions, average values based on a weighting of the emission data according to the season and the duration of the emission measurements were constructed using the data from farm-scale and pilot-scale studies. Baseline emissions for cattle and pig slurry stored uncovered were calculated. When possible, it was further distinguished between storage in tanks without slurry treatment and storage in lagoons which implies solid-liquid separation and biological treatment. The baseline emissions on an area or volume basis are: for NH 3 : 0.12 g m -2 h -1 and 0.15 g m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons, and 0.08 g m -2 h -1 and 0.24 g m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in tanks; for N 2 O: 0.0003 g m -2 h -1 for cattle slurry stored in lagoons, and 0.002 g m -2 h -1 for both slurry types stored in tanks; for CH 4 : 0.95 g m -3 h -1 and 3.5 g m -3 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons, and 0.58 g m -3 h -1 and 0.68 g m -3 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in tanks; for CO 2 : 6.6 g m -2 h -1 and 0.3 g m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons, and 8.0 g m -2 h -1 for both slurry types stored in tanks; for H 2 S: 0.04 g m -2 h -1 and 0.01 g m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons. Related to total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), baseline emissions for tanks are 16% and 15% of TAN for cattle and pig slurry, respectively. Emissions of N 2 O and CH 4 relative to nitrogen (N) and volatile solids (VS) are 0.13% of N and 0.10% of N and 2.9% of VS and 4.7% of VS for cattle and pig slurry, respectively. Total greenhouse gas emissions from slurry stores are dominated by CH 4 . The records on slurry treatment using acidification show a reduction of NH 3 and CH 4 emissions during storage while an increase occurs for N 2 O and a minor change for CO 2 as compared to untreated slurry. Solid-liquid separation causes higher losses for NH 3 and a reduction in CH 4 , N 2 O and CO 2 emissions. Anaerobically digested slurry shows higher emissions during storage for NH 3 while losses tend to be lower for CH 4 and little changes occur for N 2 O and CO 2 compared to untreated slurry. All cover types are found to be efficient for emission mitigation of NH 3 from stores. The N 2 O emissions increase in many cases due to coverage. Lower CH 4 emissions occur for impermeable covers as compared to uncovered slurry storage while for permeable covers the effect is unclear or emissions tend to increase. Limited and inconsistent data regarding emission changes with covering stores are available for CO 2 and H 2 S. The compiled data provide a basis for improving emission inventories and highlight the need for further research to reduce uncertainty and fill data gaps regarding emissions from slurry storage.Storage of slurry is an important emission source for ammonia (NH 3 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) from livestock production.

        <p>Livestock production systems around the world generate slurry-a mixture of feces and urine from housed livestock, mixed with bedding material and cleaning water (Pain and Menzi, 2011). Storage of slurry is required to enable the spreading in the field at appropriate time to supply nutrients to crops. Thus, a major part of the slurry is transferred from housings to outdoor stores such as tanks (at or above ground level) or earthen lagoons. Stores have variable forms and dimensions (e.g. up to several hectares for lagoons) according to the required storage volume. They have been identified as important emission sources for ammonia (NH 3 ), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) including nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from livestock production. Slurry stores are complex systems which influence emissions in many ways (Sommer et al., 2006;VanderZaag et al., 2008;Sommer et al., 2013).Livestock production systems around the world generate slurry-a mixture of feces and urine from housed livestock, mixed with bedding material and cleaning water (Pain and Menzi, 2011).

Slurry stores are complex systems which influence emissions in many ways (Sommer et al., 2006;VanderZaag et al., 2008;Sommer et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>A thorough description on principal mechanisms influencing the release of NH 3 , GHGs and H 2 S from slurry stores can be obtained from several studies (Olesen and Sommer, 1993;Ni, 1999;Sommer et al., 2006;VanderZaag et al., 2008;Sommer et al., 2013). Some important basic principles are summarized here. Slurry stores have a defined area where the gas exchange with the atmosphere takes place. It is a diffusive process and is quantified by emission rate values with the unit mass per area and time. Dissolved species of the gases are produced through microbial breakdown of nitrogen or organic compounds in the bulk slurry. Depending on prevailing chemical equilibria (e.g. NH 3 /NH 4 + which shifts to NH 4 + at a low pH-value) and absence of microbial consumption, the gases move towards the emitting surface driven by diffusion (i.e. movement due to concentration gradients) and convection where parcels of air or liquid induce a movement of the compounds in the slurry (Sommer et al., 2013). At the slurry-air interface, the compounds pass gas-and liquid-phase resistances and diffuse into the air where they are transported to the atmosphere by convection. Transport within the liquid phase is temperature dependent and the gas-phase transfer is dependent on both temperature and turbulence (VanderZaag et al., 2015). Depending on the dry matter content of the slurry or more precisely, the amount of particles in the slurry which is influenced by the slurry type, animal species, animal diets, the thickness of the slurry bulk layer in the stores and meteorological conditions (Smith et al., 2007), a natural crust at the slurry surface can develop. It constitutes a barrier to the gas molecules between the liquid and the air. NH 3 and CH 4 may be consumed due to microbial activity in the crust leading to an emission reduction (Petersen and Ambus, 2006;Nielsen et al., 2010) while N 2 O production may be enhanced (VanderZaag et al., 2009). Ammonia has a large variety of negative environmental impacts which encompass the quality of air, soil and water, ecosystems and biodiversity. Moreover, it contributes to the formation of particulate matter which impairs human health (Sutton et al., 2011). N 2 O and CH 4 are strong GHGs (Myhre et al., 2013). H 2 S is often related to odor nuisances and can be lethal to animals and humans at high exposure levels (Sommer et al., 2013). NH 3 and GHG emissions have been regulated by the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone (UNECE, 1999) and by the Kyoto protocol arising from the UN Framework Convention on climatic change (UN, 1997), respectively. Member countries of these protocols are obliged to calculate and report their national emissions annually, to track changes and compare to national emission ceilings where applicable.

        <p>EEA (2016); IPCC (2006) and UNECE (2014) provide emission factors for slurry storage or numbers for emission reduction related to mitigation techniques which are used for emission reporting in emission inventories. However, a considerable number of recent studies on emissions from slurry storage provide updated information. The present review paper aims therefore to collect the data on NH 3 , GHGs (CH 4 , N 2 O, CO 2 ) and H 2 S emissions from these recent but also from previous studies and to provide a comprehensive overview on emissions from cattle or pig slurry stored uncovered and emission changes due to slurry treatment and coverage of slurry stores. This information can be used for the purpose of guide values, e.g. for the evaluation of emission data, and for improving emission inventories (greater accuracy, reduced uncertainty), e.g. for the determination of baseline emissions or emission reductions due to slurry treatment or coverage of slurry stores.

        <p>(i) The investigated slurry was produced in an animal operation and consisted of urine and feces excreted from the animals onto a floor of a barn, a hardstanding or a milking parlor. The slurry might contain solids like bedding material or feed residues and be diluted with water. The investigated slurry was untreated or submitted to a treatment such as solid-liquid separation, anaerobic digestion, addition of an acid (acidification), additives or co-substrates. The treatment occurred under real-world conditions or after slurry sampling in the laboratory. Studies based on synthetic slurry, e.g. urine and feces collected separately from animals and subsequently combined in the laboratory, were excluded since fresh animal excretions substantially differ in chemical composition from stored slurry (Table 6). Moreover, urine and feces deposited onto a floor can rapidly undergo processes leading to gaseous losses. Hence, synthetic slurries might induce different emission levels as compared to slurries submitted to real-world conditions. (ii) The untreated or treated slurry was transferred from the animal operation to a storage tank or a lagoon outside of animal housings and then submitted to measurements under real-world conditions or the slurry as characterized under point (i) was collected from a floor, an underfloor pit or an outside store and subsequently transferred to an experimental vessel where emissions were measured at pilot-or laboratory-scale. Studies encompassing e.g. emissions from a pit below an animal confinement were excluded since such facilities provide an environment which substantially differs from outside stores (e.g. exposure to outdoor climate, disturbance of the slurry surface due to continuous addition of animal excretions over almost the whole area of a pit).

        <p>Since emission inventories do usually not apply emissions on an area or volume basis but emission factors which express emissions as a proportion of a compound present in the slurry store, data were additionally scaled as follows: percent of TAN for ammonia (EEA, 2016), percent of N for N 2 O (IPCC, 2006) and percent of VS for CH 4 (IPCC, 2006) and CO 2 . To be consistent with the notion "emission on an area or volume basis" regarding terminology, we used the term flow-based emission. Flow-based emissions were either taken from the papers or determined based on the emission rate, the N, TAN or VS content of the slurry, the volume of the store and the duration of the experiment. Dividing the cumulative emission which was derived from the emission rate and the duration of the study by the amount of the compounds present in the store at the beginning of the experiment (derived from the slurry content of N, TAN or VS and the slurry volume) yielded the flow-based emission. It was only calculated if no slurry addition or discharge occurred during the experiment.Since emission inventories do usually not apply emissions on an area or volume basis but emission factors which express emissions as a proportion of a compound present in the slurry store, data were additionally scaled as follows: percent of TAN for ammonia (EEA, 2016), percent of N for N 2 O (IPCC, 2006) and percent of VS for CH 4 (IPCC, 2006) and CO 2 . To be consistent with the notion "emission on an area or volume basis" regarding terminology, we used the term flow-based emission.

        <p>In a first step, descriptive statistics (number of records, minimum, 1 st quantile, median, average, 3rd quantile, maximum, standard deviation) were calculated over all records encompassing slurry stored uncovered. There were eight categories for data reporting resulting from the combination of two slurry types (cattle and pig) with four study types (farm-scale lagoon comprising solid-liquid separation and biological treatment of slurry; farm-scale tank, pilot-scale and laboratoryscale which include untreated slurry).In a first step, descriptive statistics (number of records, minimum, 1 st quantile, median, average, 3rd quantile, maximum, standard deviation) were calculated over all records encompassing slurry stored uncovered.

        <p>2.4.2.1. Definition. We define the term baseline emission as the average emission occurring with slurry storage according to the reference technology without emission control similar to VanderZaag et al. (2015). This implies uncovered storage in the following types of store: i) tanks or earthen stores without slurry treatment; ii) lagoons with solid-liquid separation and biological treatment occurring during storage (Hamilton et al., 2001). The baseline emission is considered as representative for average emissions over the whole course of a year. According to EEA (2016), baseline emissions are given separately for cattle and pig slurry. We further distinguished between storage in tanks (or earthen stores) and lagoons. Baseline emissions were calculated from uncovered slurry stores regardless of the occurrence of a natural crust because its formation can be only partially controlled and thus varies widely between stores (Smith et al., 2007). Moreover, there was insufficient information about the presence of crusts in the data impeding a distinction between crusted and non-crusted store's surfaces.2.4.2.1. Definition.

        <p>2.4.2.2. Determination. Baseline emissions were calculated using farmscale and pilot-scale studies published in peer-review papers. For the calculation of representative emissions, important influencing factors should be considered such as the meteorological conditions (mainly air temperature, wind speed, precipitation) and operations at storage facilities (Sommer et al., 2013). Among these factors, we were able to include air temperature since the season used for emission measurements which can be used as surrogate for the temperature was available for more than 90% of the records. Records were dropped where conditions prevailed which are not representative for slurry storage in practice over a longer period, e.g. if daily agitation of slurry occurred. More detailed information on meteorological conditions and operations at storage facilities was not available and could not be included in the evaluation of emissions (e.g. only approx. 60% of records provided numerical air temperature data). Information on wind speed, precipitation and crust formation was available for less than half of the records.2.4.2.2. Determination.

        <p>We hypothesized that for generating emission data which are representative over the whole course of a year, emission values generated during the cold, the warm and the temperate season (spring, fall) should be equally covered. To achieve this, a weighting of the emission data for season was done. Values were aggregated according to the categorization "Season code" ("c": cold season = winter, "t": temperate season = spring or fall, "w": warm season = summer, "c,t": cold and temperate season, "c,w": cold and warm season, "t,w": temperate and warm season, "c,t,w": cold, temperate and warm season), "Slurry type" (cattle, pig), "Type of study" (farm-scale, pilot-scale) and "Type of store" (for farm-scale studies: lagoon, tank). For some papers, emission values for each individual season "c", "t", and "w" were provided and also the average value over the year, i.e. the "c,t,w" value. In these cases, the "c,t,w" value is denoted as redundant in the database (Supplementary data 2). It was used for the further calculations and not the values of the individual seasons. The aggregated values were averaged afterwards in the following manner: i) Study duration varied considerably, i.e. individual experiments ranged from less than one day up to several months. The individual records were thus weighted according to measurement durations of records within each "Season code" category. The individual records were aggregated to four classes of measurement durations: a) ≥1 month, b) ≥1 week to &lt; 1 month, c) ≥1 day to &lt; 1 week, d) &lt; 1 day. Weighting was done based on the square-root of the median of the measurement duration for each class to avoid over-emphasis of long-term measurements. The median values of the measurement duration for the 4 classes a, b, c and d were 146.5 days, 16.9 days, 4.5 days and 0.34 days, respectively. This implied the following respective weights 12.1, 4.1, 2.1 and 0.6. Therefore, a record based on a measurement of more than one month received a weighting 20.8 times higher than a record based on a measurement over less than a day. ii) Average values for each season "c", "t" and "w" were calculated from all available values within one category (based on "Slurry type", "Type of study" and "Type of store"). Averaging was done in a way that values spanning over more than one season were attributed to the respective seasons, i.e. a value for "c,t" was attributed half to "c" and half to "t", a value of "c,t,w" was counted one fourth to seasons "c" and "w" and one half to season "t". For example, to average a "c" value based on a 2 weeks measurement (c 2weeks ), a "c" value based on a 2 days measurement (c 2days ) and a "c,w" value that based on a 2 months measurement (cw 2months ) led to the following average "c" value: "c avg " = (c 2weeks *weight 2weeks + c 2days *weight 2days + cw 2months *0.5*weight 2months )/(weight 2weeks + weight 2days + 0.5*weight 2months ). iii) These average values were further averaged to annual emission rates "c,t,w" by weighting the value for season code "t" twice as high as the seasons "c" and "w" (i.e. "c,t,w avg " = ¼*"c" + ½*"t" + ¼*"w") since the temperate season code "t" includes two seasons (spring and fall). These final averaged values are listed in column "Avg" in Tables 8,9 and Supplementary data 4.We hypothesized that for generating emission data which are representative over the whole course of a year, emission values generated during the cold, the warm and the temperate season (spring, fall) should be equally covered.

        <p>Numbers for baseline emissions are reported as average emission values if at least one record for each of the season "c", "t" and "w" was available. Included can be a record from an individual season (i.e. "c", "t" or "w"), or any kind of seasons combination (i.e. "c,t" "c,w" "t,w" or "c,t,w"). The lower and upper 95% confidence bounds (l95, u95) for baseline emissions were determined using bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap intervals (Efron, 1987) if at least three individual records for each of the season "c", "t" and "w" were available. Again, this can be in the form of an individual season or any kind of seasons combination as for the calculation of the average. The bootstrapping was done as non-parametric bootstrapping with sampling stratified by season. To test whether there are significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences in these baseline emission values, 95% confidence intervals were obtained from bootstrapping the differences between each combination of values. If a confidence interval of a difference did not include 0, the difference was marked as statistically significant.Numbers for baseline emissions are reported as average emission values if at least one record for each of the season "c", "t" and "w" was available.

The baseline emissions for lagoons are based on measurements carried out at farm-scale for lagoons. Baseline emissions expressed as flow-based emissions were given separately for cattle and pig slurry for tanks only due to a lack of appropriate data for lagoons.

        <p>We determined the emission changes due to slurry treatment techniques and covering of slurry stores using records with a treatment or a cover and a reference system (uncovered storage with untreated slurry) to compare the emissions on an area or volume basis from both. Due to the limited number of available records, the restriction to peer review papers and exclusion of laboratory-scale studies was not applied. For storage covering, all records with less than 20 cm of slurry depth were excluded from the data analysis since it is likely that such conditions differ too much from the real-world and even more evident if the thickness of the cover material is similar to that of the bulk slurry layer. Studies where slurry depth was not provided were excluded.We determined the emission changes due to slurry treatment techniques and covering of slurry stores using records with a treatment or a cover and a reference system (uncovered storage with untreated slurry) to compare the emissions on an area or volume basis from both.

        <p>Although a natural crust is often listed as abatement measure together with slurry store covers (Bittman et al., 2014) we did not consider it as a mitigation technique equivalent to covering of slurry stores. In contrast to coverings such as impermeable floating covers, it is not applicable for all stores since it does not form at each slurry type. Crusting was neither considered for the analysis on emission changes due to slurry treatment and covering of slurry stores because of insufficient information about the presence of crusts in the experimental data. The significance of crusting is specifically addressed in Section 4.2.4.Although a natural crust is often listed as abatement measure together with slurry store covers (Bittman et al., 2014) we did not consider it as a mitigation technique equivalent to covering of slurry stores.

        <p>An overview of the investigated slurry types is shown in Table 4. Cattle and pig slurry each account for about 50% of the investigated slurries. Cattle slurry mostly originated from dairy cows while for pig slurry fattening pigs and breeding pigs or a mixture of both was studied. Other types of slurry were included in measurements as well, but these occur much less. The proportion of untreated slurries is 65% and 87% for cattle slurry and pig slurry, respectively. Solid-liquid separation occurs for 16% (cattle slurry) and 3.7% (pig slurry) of the records. Anaerobic digestion of unseparated slurry applies for 7.2% (cattle slurry) and 3.7% (pig slurry) of the records while for anaerobically digested and separated slurry, the numbers are 8.1% for cattle slurry and 0.6% for pig slurry, respectively. Other treatments encompass acidification, aeration, supplementation with additives or dilution of slurry, but these treatments occur less.An overview of the investigated slurry types is shown in Table 4.

        <p>Slurry analyses are shown in Table 6. Not all studies provided analytical data of the slurry (e.g., only 84% of NH 3 studies presented TAN values). While most laboratory studies analyzed TAN, only 67% of the studies carried out at farm sites reported this parameter. Pilot-scale studies lie in between with 92% of records reporting TAN data. The availability of analytical data is similar for other parameters (e.g. DM) as for TAN but with somewhat lower numbers. The composition of the mixture of urine and feces as excreted by animals published by ASAE (2005) and Richner et al. ( 2017) is added at the bottom of Table 6. They provide numbers for cattle on DM, VS and TAN in the range of 80 to 90 g L -1 , 53 to 70 g L -1 and 1.4 to 2.1 g L -1 , respectively. For pigs, the values for DM, VS and TAN are in the range of 50 to 90 g L -1 , 36 g L -1 and 3.4 to 5.0 g L -1 . The slurry analyses given in the records show substantially lower numbers for DM and VS contents for untreated slurries which is most likely due to dilution with water from farm operation and rainfall at the farms (Table 6). Studies at farm-scale based on tanks, at pilot-scale and at laboratory-scale exhibit DM contents which are in a similar range within cattle and pig slurry. Numbers for DM are lower for pig slurries compared to cattle slurry except for laboratory scale studies. Pig slurry exhibits higher N tot and TAN contents than cattle slurry. Within farm-scale studies, the numbers for all analytes strongly differ between slurry from tanks and from lagoons. Values for DM, VS, N tot and TAN are lower for lagoons by a factor of approximately two to eight as compared to slurry stored in tanks. Slurries from lagoons compare better with slurries after solid-liquid separation (Table 6) than with untreated slurries.Slurry analyses are shown in Table 6.

        <p>The high variability of emission levels as shown by descriptive statistics (Table 7) may be due to different meteorological conditions, disturbance of the slurry surface induced by operations at the stores and slurry characteristics. The enhanced variability in laboratory-scale studies compared to the other study types is striking. In laboratory-scale studies, the environment is expected to be largely uniform since the experiments were mostly conducted in a temperature-controlled room with ambient temperatures lying in a narrow range and the slurry being undisturbed. As most of the laboratory-scale studies aimed at a comparison of different techniques or systems, the representativeness of the resulting emission rates for real-world conditions was not the primary focus and discrepancies between different approaches are very likely present. A thorough evaluation of potential biases of the laboratory studies is not possible due to missing information on the measuring systems and is beyond the scope of this paper (see Liu et al. (2020) and the related discussion). Also, for other study types, the occurrence of methodological biases cannot be ruled out which may lead to implausible results. Detection of striking values might be hampered due to the multitude in units used in the papers. Therefore, a standardization as used here and providing guide values are important issues. For this, a favorable option is the unit g m -2 h -1 or g m -3 h -1 of a molecule. It is equally suitable to illustrate an emission pattern within one day, also in combination with important influencing factors such as temperature or wind speed which can change over short time periods and to compare them with e.g. average emissions over one year. If a yearly amount of a gas release is required, data can be obtained from Table 8. Alternatively, the unit mol m -2 h -1 could be used to facilitate the comparability between different molecules, even if to date, it is generally not used in the context of emission inventories.The high variability of emission levels as shown by descriptive statistics (Table 7) may be due to different meteorological conditions, disturbance of the slurry surface induced by operations at the stores and slurry characteristics.

        <p>Operations at the storage tank, such as agitation, filling and removing of slurry are necessarily related to real-world storage systems. Their effects are usually reflected in farm-scale measurements using non-intrusive methods but rarely included in pilot studies or farm-scale studies using chamber systems. A series of studies specifically investigated such processes (see Supplementary data 10). They showed consistent results and provided evidence that disturbance of the manure surface due to slurry agitation, filling and discharging of the stores induces large episodic emissions for NH 3 , CH 4 , CO 2 but not for N 2 O. While emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 rapidly decline after cessation of the operations and can even drop to levels below the previously undisturbed stores, increased emission levels persist for NH 3 . Due to the relatively short time duration of agitation over the year and the subsequent drop below average levels for CH 4 , this operation per se does not substantially contribute to annual NH 3 and GHG emissions from slurry (VanderZaag et al., 2009). A more detailed overview on emissions during and following operations at stores is given in the Supplementary data 10.Operations at the storage tank, such as agitation, filling and removing of slurry are necessarily related to real-world storage systems.

        <p>Increasing air temperature and wind speed enhance the emissions since they directly affect diffusion and convection of gases near the emitting surfaces (Sommer et al., 2013). The relationship between the temperature as represented by the season of measurements and the emission level could be demonstrated in the present study (Supplementary data 5). It must be considered however, that the air temperature is a simplistic surrogate for the slurry temperature which is a determinant factor for GHG emissions. Rennie et al. (2018) demonstrated that slurry store design and operations (i.e. filling level, agitation) influence the slurry temperature and the emission level of gases such as CH 4 . In 25 studies, slurry temperatures during different seasons are available. Slurry temperatures increase as expected in the order cold &lt; temperate &lt; warm for 94% of the cases. The effects of temperature and wind speed are not discussed further in the present study because this topic has been previously covered by e.g. Ni (1999) or Sommer et al. (2006). In contrast, emission changes related to the influence of rain events and thawing of the slurry surface are summarized here since they have been less frequently addressed in the literature. Petersen et al. (2013) found lower NH 3 emission from uncovered storage of pig slurry with precipitation than from the treatment without rain although the differences are not statistically significant. It was shown that ammonia emissions can decline towards zero during rain events after slurry spreading (Hafner et al., 2019) due to sorption of NH 3 onto wet surfaces. Moreover, the TAN-concentration at the emitting surface may decrease with precipitation due to dilution or transport of TAN from a crusted slurry surface into the bulk liquid. Overall, it can thus be assumed that NH 3 emissions from slurry storage during rain events are low. In contrast, an increase in emissions of CH 4 has been observed. Balde et al. (2016b) reported average emissions of 1.8 g CH 4 m -2 h -1 for digested slurry while peak emissions during rain events reached 10 g CH 4 m -2 h -1 . This was likely due to bursting of bubbles at or near the surface. Elevated emissions were also observed by Balde et al. (2016a) (1998) suggested that the emission increase is due to more disturbance at the slurry surface induced by rain and thus enhancement of the CH 4 exchange through the liquid surface area and of incidental outburst of gas bubbles (ebullition). Petersen et al. (2013) found a drop of N 2 O emissions to zero as a result of rewetting of the crust after rainfall inducing a shift towards anaerobic conditions. Grant and Boehm (2015) did not find a relationship between H 2 S emissions and rain events.Increasing air temperature and wind speed enhance the emissions since they directly affect diffusion and convection of gases near the emitting surfaces (Sommer et al., 2013). The relationship between the temperature as represented by the season of measurements and the emission level could be demonstrated in the present study (Supplementary data 5). It must be considered however, that the air temperature is a simplistic surrogate for the slurry temperature which is a determinant factor for GHG emissions. Rennie et al. (2018) demonstrated that slurry store design and operations (i.e. filling level, agitation) influence the slurry temperature and the emission level of gases such as CH 4 .

        <p>VanderZaag et al. ( 2011) observed important bubble flux events in late winter/early spring that coincided with surface thawing which were probably due to a release of previously produced CH 4 that was trapped under the frozen slurry surface. In the study of VanderZaag et al. (2010a) which encompassed winter and spring, N 2 O release was only recorded during spring thaw. A moderate increase in CH 4 emissions was observed during the same period at slurry temperatures above 0 °C while NH 3 and CO 2 flows were unaffected by spring thaw. Elevated CH 4 emissions due to thawing of the manure store were also reported by Leytem et al. (2017).VanderZaag et al.

        <p>There is agreement that crusting impacts the gas release in many ways: enhanced resistance to mass transfer (Olesen and Sommer, 1993), oxidation of NH 3 (Nielsen et al., 2010) and CH 4 (Petersen et al., 2005) and formation of N 2 O related to nitrification and denitrification occurring in liquid-air interfaces near air-filled pores present in crusts (Petersen and Miller, 2006). Several studies investigated the effect of a natural crust on the emission level (Sommer et al., 1993;Misselbrook et al., 2005;Aguerre et al., 2012;Wood et al., 2012). All studies showed that a natural crust provided an efficient barrier leading to an emission reduction for NH 3 . Baldé et al. (2018) confirmed these findings by measurements conducted under farm conditions at tanks and earthen basins containing slurries with differing ability to form natural crusts (i.e. raw cattle slurry, the liquid fraction of cattle slurry produced by solid-liquid separation, digested slurry with and without solid-liquid separation). They confirmed that slurry stored with a thick surface had lower NH 3 losses. Grant and Boehm (2015) found that crusting of a lagoon surface containing dairy cow slurry reduced NH 3 but not H 2 S emissions. Nielsen et al. (2010) showed that NH 3 -oxidizing bacteria may contribute to a significant reduction of NH 3 emissions if a natural crust is present on a slurry store. Grant and Boehm (2018) found emissions from a tank containing pig slurry to be greater by 10% when the surface was covered with a crust than without crusting (difference not statistically significant). They explained their findings by the higher TAN content of the crusted slurry surface as compared to a non-crusted one. Sommer et al. (2000) and Husted (1994) found higher emissions of CH 4 from slurry without than from slurry with a natural surface crust. Wood et al. (2012) investigated the emissions from dairy slurry with varying DM contents and thus natural crusts with different thicknesses and coverage of the storage surfaces. They were not able to relate the CH 4 fluxes to the presence of a natural crust. N 2 O production was found to be enhanced after build-up of a natural crust (VanderZaag et al., 2009).There is agreement that crusting impacts the gas release in many ways: enhanced resistance to mass transfer (Olesen and Sommer, 1993), oxidation of NH 3 (Nielsen et al., 2010) and CH 4 (Petersen et al., 2005) and formation of N 2 O related to nitrification and denitrification occurring in liquid-air interfaces near air-filled pores present in crusts (Petersen and Miller, 2006).

        <p>In the literature (e.g. Vanderzaag et al., 2015), a natural crust is often classified as abatement measure for NH 3 similar as slurry store covers. However, crust formation can only be controlled to a limited extent. Crusts are of variable thickness, coverage of the store and durability. Their effectiveness for emission abatement has therefore be considered as inconsistent (Vanderzaag et al., 2015). Crusts only develop for slurry types with a high content of fibrous material (Bittman et al., 2014). This applies mainly for cattle slurry (Smith et al., 2007) and less for pig slurry (Sommer et al., 2006). Crusting is likely to occur at a slurry DM content of more than 20 g L -1 (Sommer et al., 2006;Wood et al., 2012) which mostly does not apply for slurry stored in lagoons (Table 6). Consequently, they have much less ability to form a natural crust as shown by e.g. Balde et al.

        <p>We therefore did not consider crusting as an emission mitigation technique equivalent to slurry store covers but rather as a parameter influencing emissions from stored slurry and thus excluded it from the analysis of emission changes due to covering of stores. But we stress that if a natural crust is present, it is likely to significantly contribute to an emission reduction and, therefore, should be preserved by e.g. reducing slurry agitation and addition of manure below the surface.We therefore did not consider crusting as an emission mitigation technique equivalent to slurry store covers but rather as a parameter influencing emissions from stored slurry and thus excluded it from the analysis of emission changes due to covering of stores.

        <p>The limited information in the data impedes our ability to clearly distinguish between crusted and non-crusted stores. This may be relevant for (i) the calculation of baseline emissions and (ii) emissions changes due to slurry treatments and covering of stores: (i) baseline emissions determined here may include stores with variable occurrence of a natural crust. For lagoons, information on crusting was available for 45% (cattle slurry) and 19% (pig slurry) of the records, respectively. Among these, 62% of the lagoons containing cattle slurry were fully or partly covered by a crust during the emission measurements. For pig slurry, this applies for 21% only. Among records used for the determination of baseline emissions for tanks, 78% and 50% included information regarding crusting for cattle and pig slurry, respectively. Of these, 83% (cattle slurry) and 48% (pig slurry) had a fully or partly crusted surface. This complies with findings that crusting occurs less on lagoon surfaces and stores containing pig slurry. The proportion of crust occurrence for cattle slurry stored in tanks is in line with earlier findings (Smith et al., 2007). We thus suggest that the baseline emissions determined here are based on studies which appropriately reflect the range of store surface crusts occurring at farms. (ii) A natural crust may occur in combination with a storage cover and thereby be enhanced (Chadwick et al., 2011) since the slurry surface is less exposed to wind turbulence. In experiments comparing uncovered and covered storage, it is thus difficult to stringently distinguish between the effect of covering and of crusting. Moreover, this information is not always available: only 60% of the records used to determine the emission change due to covering included information on crusting. From these, about half had crusted surfaces and the other half not. This might partly explain the variability of emission changes due to covering found here. These considerations should be taken into account for the discussion in the Sections 4.4 and 4.6.The limited information in the data impedes our ability to clearly distinguish between crusted and non-crusted stores.

        <p>Data should only be included for the calculation of baseline emissions if they can be considered as representative or typical for gas flows occurring at farm conditions. In principle, this applies for farm-scale studies. Pilot-scale studies imply some aspects of farm-scale studies due to measurements conducted in outdoor facilities and a slurry volume in the order of several cubic meters. But there are concerns extrapolating data from pilot-scale studies to real-world systems. VanderZaag et al. (2009VanderZaag et al. ( , 2010aVanderZaag et al.

Moreover, almost all pilot-scale studies are based on flux chambers. VanderZaag et al. (2010b) argued that steady-state chambers alter the enclosed environment and concluded that absolute fluxes measured might deviate from emissions that would occur without chambers. Nevertheless, several studies conducted in pilot-scale facilities similar to that of VanderZaag et al. (2009VanderZaag et al. ( , 2010aVanderZaag et al.

        <p>Emission peaks for CH 4 were observed in several studies (VanderZaag et al., 2011;Balde et al., 2016a) due to ebullition. They may remain unrecorded (Rodhe et al., 2012) unless the gas measurements are continuous with a high temporal resolution. This shortcoming may apply for pilot-scale studies where e.g. a flow chamber is used which is moved between several experimental tanks (e.g. Amon et al., 2006). Intermittent gas sampling can hamper measurements at a farm-scale as well. Grant et al. (2015) assumed differences in emission levels between two locations due to under-sampling of ebullition events given the short measurement periods. Sampling large storage areas using chambers might be hampered if the sampled surface areas are not representative for the entire store. Balde et al. (2016b) found average emissions of CH 4 measured at an earthen storage containing liquid digestate with a floating chamber which were about four-fold greater than measured at the same time with a nonintrusive bLS technique. The authors explained this by the limited area covered by the chamber and by disturbances induced by the chamber causing bubble formation and bursting thereby increasing emissions.Emission peaks for CH 4 were observed in several studies (VanderZaag et al., 2011;Balde et al., 2016a) due to ebullition.

        <p>To summarize, it can be hypothesized that farm-scale measurements using non-intrusive methods are a preferential option. Still, data from such studies are limited at present time. Therefore, inclusion of records from pilot-scale and farm-scale studies appears to be the best opportunity for the determination of baseline emissions. This approach provides a larger data basis as if only farm-scale studies were included. Moreover, Table 8 shows that emissions from pilot-scale studies comply with farm-scale studies tank for NH 3 but less for CH 4 . On the other hand, we excluded laboratory-scale studies for the determination of baseline emissions. They are mostly not designed for generating emission rates. Their experimental conditions strongly deviate from an environment that occurs under practical conditions. The enhanced variability found in emissions level from laboratory-scale studies (section 3.1.2) points to severe methodological shortcomings which might bias baseline values.To summarize, it can be hypothesized that farm-scale measurements using non-intrusive methods are a preferential option.

        <p>NH 3 emissions from pig slurry are higher as expected due to its higher TAN content and its lower ability to form a natural crust compared to cattle slurry. Sommer et al. (2006) andVanderZaag et al. (2015) suggested lower emissions on an area basis from pig slurry stored in lagoons than from storage in tanks. This complies with the results of this study (Table 8). Lagoons are the prevailing system for slurry storage in the US (Sorensen et al., 2013). They usually have a greater surface area than tanks which would imply more exposure to the ambient air turbulence suggesting a higher emission potential. Slurries from lagoons have on average a lower dry matter and TAN content as compared to tanks. This might be due to a stronger dilution with water: e.g. five out of six lagoons investigated by Leytem et al. (2017) collected parlor wash water and not slurry from a pit of a livestock housing. We assume that solid-liquid-separation was applied at the farms studied which have lagoons although this was not always clearly defined in the papers. This is supported by the low contents in DM and TAN in slurry from lagoons as shown in Table 6. The lower solids content would enhance the emission potential due to less ability for formation of a natural crust at the slurry surface (Wood et al., 2012). But the lower TAN content induces the opposite effect on NH 3 emissions (Sommer et al., 2006). The overall impact of these effects combined on the emission level is difficult to assess. The present data suggest higher emissions from lagoons than from tanks containing cattle slurry but the opposite for pig slurry.NH 3 emissions from pig slurry are higher as expected due to its higher TAN content and its lower ability to form a natural crust compared to cattle slurry.

        <p>The baseline emissions (lagoons: 0.12 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 and 0.15 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry, tanks: 0.08 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 and 0.24 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry, respectively), are mostly lower than numbers given by VanderZaag et al. (2015), Sommer et al. (2006) and Bittman et al. (2014). VanderZaag et al. (2015) suggested emissions for crusted and non-crusted cattle slurry of 0.11 and 0.19 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 , respectively, from tanks or lagoons. For pig slurry stored in a lagoon, they give 0.12 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 , and stored in a tank, 0.40 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 . Sommer et al. ( 2006) provided similar values. Bittman et al. (2014) gave baseline emissions between 0.19 and 0.40 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 . They attributed the lower value to slurry which is frozen in the store for several months, and the higher value applies to warm countries. For N 2 O, most studies exhibit emissions clearly below 0.01 g N 2 O m -2 h -1 (Supplementary data 8). In contrast, three papers reach values from 0.02 to 0.06 g N 2 O m -2 h -1 and N 2 O losses ranging between 25% and 160% of the NH 3 emissions determined concomitantly (Clemens et al., 2006;Amon et al., 2007;Leytem et al., 2011). Unless at very low levels of NH 3 emissions, flows of both NH 3 and N 2 O in the same order of magnitude do not occur in other records and have not been reported in the livestock sector (e.g. EEA, 2016). Therefore, the data from the three studies were excluded for the calculation of baseline emissions. If they were kept, the baseline emissions for N 2 O would be higher by a factor of two and three for cattle and pig slurry stored in tanks, respectively. Chadwick et al. (2011) stated in their review that N 2 O emission from slurry stores without a surface cover are negligible which supports the baseline emissions shown in Table 8.The baseline emissions (lagoons: 0.12 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 and 0.15 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry, tanks: 0.08 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 and 0.24 g NH 3 m -2 h -1 for cattle and pig slurry, respectively), are mostly lower than numbers given by VanderZaag et al.

        <p>For CH 4 , higher emissions occur for farm-scale studies than for pilotscale studies (Table 8; statistically significant differences for emissions on an area basis; p &lt; 0.05; Supplementary data 4). This could be due to the temperature dependency of methanogenesis (Elsgaard et al., 2016). Pilot-scale studies exhibit lower slurry volumes as compared to farmscale stores which suggests faster cooling of the slurry and therefore a lower methane conversion rate. Another reason could be the batchfilling of vessels used for pilot-scale studies which differs from continuous filling and incomplete removal of slurry at farm-scale stores. Under such conditions, aged slurry may act as inoculum which was shown to enhance emissions of CH 4 (Wood et al., 2014). Overall, the lower emission level for CH 4 measured at pilot-scale included for the determination of baseline emissions tank could lead to an underestimation thereof.For CH 4 , higher emissions occur for farm-scale studies than for pilotscale studies (Table 8; statistically significant differences for emissions on an area basis; p &lt; 0.05; Supplementary data 4). This could be due to the temperature dependency of methanogenesis (Elsgaard et al., 2016).

        <p>The review of Owen and Silver (2015) reported CH 4 emission data from lagoons and tanks of dairy systems being 2.3 and 2.7 g CH 4 m -2 h - 1 , respectively. This is higher than data from farm-scale studies reported here which are 1.2 and 1.3 g CH 4 m -2 h -1 for cattle slurry stored in lagoons and tanks, respectively (Supplementary data 4). However, the data basis of Owen and Silver (2015) is smaller and measurements carried out in the warm season tend to be overrepresented. The higher CH 4 emissions from pig slurry as compared to cattle slurry are expected due to the higher methane production potential of pig slurry (Triolo et al., 2011). Both cattle and pig slurry exhibit lower losses from tanks than from lagoons. Moreover, lagoon storage produces a solid fraction which includes a large proportion of the slurry VS generating additional emissions. According to VanderZaag et al. (2010b), a CO 2 -C:CH 4 -C ratio of 50:50 is expected from stores. Looking at records which include emission data of both CH 4 and CO 2 , a large variation occurs. The average CO 2 -C:CH 4 -C ratio is approximately 65:35 which also differs from the CH 4 to CO 2 relationship expected from anaerobic digestion of livestock slurries (ca. 55%-70% CH 4 content of dry biogas; Triolo et al., 2011). This could be due to a tendency for greater CO 2 -C:CH 4 -C ratios in pilot-scale studies which increases the average CO 2 -C:CH 4 -C ratio of all records included. The greater ratios were also linked to studies with low CH 4 fluxes. This is likely because pilot-scale studies had less ability to provide appropriate conditions for CH 4 production as mentioned above. On the other hand, CO 2 seems to be emitted more consistently in all studies.The review of Owen and Silver (2015) reported CH 4 emission data from lagoons and tanks of dairy systems being 2.3 and 2.7 g CH 4 m -2 h - 1 , respectively.

        <p>As the aim of all studies considered for the calculation of baseline values in the present paper was the determination of emission rates we think that the baseline emissions are robust and reflect the current state of knowledge. But the confidence intervals shown in Table 8 may be substantial. This suggests an inherent variability in the systems which can be due to differing conditions regarding meteorological conditions, operations at stores and occurrence of a natural crust. Baseline values must be considered as average numbers. In a specific situation and e.g. for representative regional values, deviations from the presented baseline values can occur. Moreover, methodological biases cannot be ruled out and different experimental approaches might entail systematic differences in results (e.g. possibly CH 4 emissions from pilotscale studies). Such effects have been observed for experimental data on NH 3 emissions from slurry application (Hafner et al., 2018).As the aim of all studies considered for the calculation of baseline values in the present paper was the determination of emission rates we think that the baseline emissions are robust and reflect the current state of knowledge.

        <p>The determined baseline emission values for NH 3 of 16% of TAN and 15% of TAN for cattle and pig slurry, respectively, which are mostly based on pilot-scale studies exhibit similar values as the emission factors of EEA (2016) which give 20% of TAN and 14% of TAN as Tier 2 default values for cattle and pig slurry. Data from farm-scale studies have comparable numbers for storage in tanks for cattle slurry: 16% of TAN (Baldé et al., 2018) and13% of TAN (McGinn et al., 2008) but lower emissions for pig slurry (Dinuccio et al., 2012) with 2% and 5% of TAN. Flow-based emissions are not available for lagoons. IPCC (2006) and EEA ( 2016) suggest an N 2 O emission factor being zero for slurry storage without a natural crust. For a crusted store, IPCC (2006) and EEA (2016) give EFs of 0.5% of N and 1% of TAN entering the store, respectively. These values are higher than the values determined in this study which are 0.13% of N and 0.10% of N for cattle and pig slurry, respectively (Table 9). The eight highest values for flow-based N 2 O emissions originate from records that include slurry stores with a crust which supports the occurrence of N 2 O emissions with crusted store surfaces. This complies with Sommer et al. (2000) who suggest that N 2 O is produced in drying of natural crusts where aerobic and anaerobic zones exist. Drying enhances convection of liquid upward through the cover, where dissolved ammonium can be oxidized by nitrifying bacteria in an aerobic environment and under such conditions, molecules produced from nitrification can be denitrified. During ammonium oxidation and denitrification, N 2 O is released as an intermediate or final product.

        <p>For CH 4 , a direct comparison between the suggested baseline emissions with default emission factors used in models for emission inventories is not possible. A simplified application of the approach of Mangino et al. (2001) and IPCC (2006) using the methane conversion factor (MCF) for slurry in a cool climate with an annual average temperature of 14 °C results in a CH 4 emission of ca. 4.0% of VS and 7.5% of VS for cattle slurry and pig slurry, respectively. These figures are somewhat higher than the baseline emissions suggested (Table 9) which are 2.9% of VS and 4.7% of VS for cattle and pig slurry, respectively. It should be noted that emission values for CH 4 derived from such model approaches can strongly deviate from measured values as shown by several studies (e.g. Kariyapperuma et al., 2018).For CH 4 , a direct comparison between the suggested baseline emissions with default emission factors used in models for emission inventories is not possible.

        <p>For the determination of flow-based emissions, analytical data of the slurry, the flow volume of slurry into storage and its residence time in the store must be known. Determining these three parameters is not straightforward which might explain the high degree of absence regarding flow-based emissions in farm-scale studies. This particularly applies for lagoons where extended slurry residence times, accumulation of solids over long time periods and repeated recycling of liquids used for flushing or recharging pits of livestock housings represent additional challenges. Generally, lagoons have a greater surface to volume ratio and longer slurry residence times as compared to tanks. These two factors will lead to higher flow-based emissions for lagoons as compared to tanks if identical emissions on an area basis are assumed for both storage systems.For the determination of flow-based emissions, analytical data of the slurry, the flow volume of slurry into storage and its residence time in the store must be known.

        <p>The pH value has a strong effect on gaseous emissions from slurry stores (Sommer et al., 2013). This is appropriately reflected by the data on emission changes due to slurry acidification through addition of inorganic acids shown in Table 10. The variability in the achieved reduction is likely related to the degree of acidification and the different pH values in slurry (Dai and Blanes-Vidal, 2013). The emission reductions found for NH 3 and CH 4 are in line with the review of Fangueiro et al. (2015). Similarly, Petersen et al.

Additives other than acids to reduce gaseous emissions or odor nuisance from manure storage have been investigated in some studies (Martinez et al., 2003;Sun et al., 2014;Owusu-Twum et al., 2017). A clear emission reduction due to other additives did not occur. Similarly, Van der Stelt et al. (2007); Wheeler et al.

        <p>The number of studies allowing a direct comparison of emissions from storage of untreated slurry and anaerobically digested slurry is limited since biogas plants are mostly fed with manure and off-farm organic feedstock material which hampers a direct comparison with unamended untreated slurry. The increase of NH 3 emissions due to anaerobic digestion complies with studies which include anaerobic digestion with addition of organic feedstock material. Baldé et al. (2018) measured NH 3 emissions from two stores at different farms containing untreated livestock slurry and liquid digestate obtained from livestock slurry and organic feedstock materials under farm conditions. Emissions from the untreated slurry were lower. Koirala et al. (2013) suggested that anaerobic digestion of dairy slurry significantly increased the NH 3 volatilization potential. The most important factor was the enhanced ammonium dissociation. Anaerobic digestion seems to reduce CH 4 emissions during slurry storage. Maldaner et al. (2018) found lower CH 4 losses from the liquid fraction of anaerobically digested slurry amended with organic feedstock material compared to unamended raw slurry from the same farm before the installation of anaerobic digestion. This is likely due to the reduction of the VS load after digestion but also a consequence of solids removal with solid-liquid separation of the major part of the digestate. Furthermore, Maldaner et al. (2018) suggested that VS remaining in the digestate was less degradable which leads to a reduced CH 4 production. VanderZaag et al. (2018) showed the CH 4 emission potential (B 0 ) from digestate was 35% lower than the B 0 of untreated manure. In contrast, Sommer et al. (2000) and Rodhe et al. (2015) measured higher emissions from anaerobically digested slurry as compared to untreated cattle slurry. They explained this by the presence of a larger and more active microbial community in digested slurry. However, most storage tanks are never completely empty. Residual aged slurry may act as inoculum and enhance the production of CH 4 (Sommer et al., 2007;Ngwabie et al., 2016). Although, the microbial population in aged slurry may be less efficient for methane production as compared to microbes present in anaerobically digested slurry, the higher amount of degradable organic carbon available in untreated slurry might compensate this. It can therefore be hypothesized that untreated slurries as occurring in realworld stores imply a higher potential for CH 4 emissions than anaerobically digested slurry.The number of studies allowing a direct comparison of emissions from storage of untreated slurry and anaerobically digested slurry is limited since biogas plants are mostly fed with manure and off-farm organic feedstock material which hampers a direct comparison with unamended untreated slurry.

        <p>Solid-liquid separation reduces the solids content of the slurry and thus the potential to develop a natural crust. This enhances NH 3 emissions during storage which complies with the increasing emissions of cattle slurry due to solid-liquid separation. Pig slurry exhibits a lower ability to form a natural crust which could explain why almost no effect of solid-liquid separation on NH 3 emissions can be observed (Table 10). Baldé et al. (2018) investigated the NH 3 emissions from two stores situated at different dairy farms containing untreated slurry and separated liquids under farm conditions. They measured higher emissions from the liquid fraction than from the untreated slurry and reported similar findings for the separated liquids from digestate derived from livestock slurry and organic feedstock materials. In contrast, Hjorth et al. (2009) found significantly higher NH 3 emissions from raw and digested slurries than from the corresponding liquid fractions. They explained their findings by the higher ammonium and N contents of the unseparated raw and pre-digested slurries compared with the liquid fractions, which increased the potential for NH 3 volatilization. The lower N 2 O storage emissions of the liquid fraction for cattle slurry as compared to raw slurry is in line with the conclusions of the review paper published by Chadwick et al. (2011). The reduced emissions of CH 4 due to solid-liquid separation results from the reduction of the total solids content in the slurry which can be considered as a surrogate for the available VS pool. This leads to a lower amount of organic matter which can be degraded to CH 4 and CO 2 (Wood et al., 2012). However, yearly average CH 4 emissions of 1.4 g CH m -3 h -1 and 2.2 g CH m -3 h -1 for the first and second year of measurements were reported for dairy slurry from a farm-scale study conducted at a tank (Balde et al., 2016a). These numbers exceed the baseline emission and emissions from farmscale studies from tanks for cattle slurry given in Table 8. Balde et al. (2016a) explained the elevated emission levels by the high biodegradability of the liquid fraction and the limited crust development. VanderZaag et al. (2018) showed that the speed of CH 4 production was much higher for the separated liquid fraction, compared to untreated slurry. Grant et al. (2015) found CH 4 emissions on an area basis from the liquid fraction of cattle slurry stored in a lagoon which are similar to the baseline emission for cattle slurry (Supplementary data 4).

        <p>Dilution of slurry with water changes its DM content. DM of slurry can be considered as an indicator for the N/TAN-and VS-content which influences the potential production of NH 3 , N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 , respectively (Wood et al., 2012). However, DM affects the formation of a natural crust as well (section 4.2.4). Overall, dilution leads to a reduction of all investigated gases which complies with the findings of Ni et al. (2010) for NH 3 and CO 2 and of Habetwold et al. (2017) for CH 4 . But this conclusion is based on pilot-scale studies where the slurry volume is identical for the diluted and untreated slurry. Under practical conditions, addition of water leads to a higher amount of slurry. If the area of manure stores is thereby increased due to requiring larger storage capacities, the reduction might be overcompensated due to a rise in emitting surface (Ni et al., 2010).Dilution of slurry with water changes its DM content.

        <p>Aeration of slurry is a technique which is used to remove excess N from slurries. It induces nitrification and denitrification that converts TAN in the slurry to nitrite/nitrate with the aim of a complete denitrification to N 2 . If the process is not properly controlled aeration can produce substantial amounts of NH 3 and N 2 O (Loyon et al., 2007). The effect of aeration was investigated in several laboratory-and pilot-scale studies. Amon et al. (2006) found a strong increase of NH 3 emissions by up to a factor of five. Molodovskaya et al. (2008) reported NH 3 emissions of up to 50% of total slurry N. Losses were increased at greater aeration rates. Many studies found a strong increase in emissions for N 2 O with aeration (Beline et al., 1999;Beline and Martinez, 2002;Amon et al., 2006;Loyon et al., 2007). Low emissions for both NH 3 and N 2 O were achieved from low flow phased oxic/anoxic treatment (Molodovskaya et al., 2008). A reduction of CH 4 by ca. 50% to almost 100% emissions was observed by Martinez et al. (2003) and Amon et al. (2006) if slurry aeration was applied.

        <p>An increase in emissions of a specific gas during slurry storage due to a treatment technique does not necessarily indicate a conflict related to emission mitigation. Enhanced losses during storage can be reduced by e.g. storage covering and might be overcompensated by reduced emissions during subsequent field application. The overarching goal of manure management is the reduction of gaseous losses between the excretion by livestock and uptake by arable and fodder crops. Therefore, the discussion on effects of slurry treatments on emissions from slurry storage must consider the context of good management practices along the whole manure management chain (Sajeev et al., 2018).An increase in emissions of a specific gas during slurry storage due to a treatment technique does not necessarily indicate a conflict related to emission mitigation.

        <p>Almost all types of covers induce a substantial emission reduction for NH 3 which complies with the review of VanderZaag et al. (2008). Emission reductions lie in a similar range for all categories of covers and for both cattle and pig slurry. This contrasts to Bittman et al. (2014) who give distinct values for the different cover types and lower values for "Low technology" floating covers such as permeable natural floating covers. VanderZaag et al. (2015) give an emission reduction of 80% for impermeable structural covers and for impermeable synthetic floating covers which is in the range of the values given in Table 11. A larger layer thickness of natural floating covers leads to a higher emission reduction (Guarino et al., 2006;VanderZaag et al., 2009). This is probably due to a more efficient barrier for the gas transport between the slurry and the ambient air (VanderZaag et al., 2009). Other cover types not included in the data analysis according to section 2.4.3 also efficiently reduce NH 3 emissions. Organic materials such as steamtreated wood or biochar were shown to exhibit similar effects as floating covers consisting of straw or peat (Holly and Larson, 2017b). Minerals like perlite or zeolite were also found to be efficient in NH 3 emission reduction (Hörnig et al., 1999;Portejoie et al., 2003).Almost all types of covers induce a substantial emission reduction for NH 3 which complies with the review of VanderZaag et al.

        <p>The increase in emissions observed for N 2 O in many cases agrees with the previously published literature (VanderZaag et al., 2008;Chadwick et al., 2011). Petersen et al. (2013) observed lower N 2 O flows with a straw cover exposed to precipitation as compared to straw covers where wetting by precipitation was excluded. Sommer et al. (2000) suggested that N 2 O is only produced in periods with drying surface layers. Storage covers can influence the formation of a natural crust (Chadwick et al., 2011). A natural surface crust on slurry can provide sites with aerobic conditions where nitrification occurs which produces N 2 O (Sommer et al., 2000). Therefore, the variability in emission changes due to slurry storage covering could be driven by differing moisture contents of the manure surfaces and differing formation of a natural crust due to covering. However, the number of records related to emission changes for N 2 O due to store covers is sparse and these findings can be uncertain.The increase in emissions observed for N 2 O in many cases agrees with the previously published literature (VanderZaag et al., 2008;Chadwick et al., 2011).

        <p>The observed increase in CH 4 emissions for plastic fabrics, expanded polystyrene and peat complies with the review of VanderZaag et al. (2008). Straw covers provide additional carbon but might reduce ebullition and increase aerobic microbial activity at the upper storage layer (VanderZaag et al., 2009). This induces contrasting effects on CH 4 net emissions. VanderZaag et al. (2009) suggested that the reduction of CH 4 emissions due to a straw cover is related to areas in a crust where microbial breakdown of CH 4 might occur. It can be assumed that the enhanced CH 4 consumption overcompensates the increased potential for CH 4 production due to the additional carbon supply with straw. An opposite effect can occur if straw is incorporated into the bulk slurry during storage due to e.g. agitation. Petersen et al. (2013) found that an elevated CH 4 concentration in the gas phase above the slurry surface is required for a significant stimulation of methane oxidation. This would support the preponderant emission reduction found for impermeable covers. For other cover types, the CH 4 concentration above the emitting surface might have been inconsistent in the experiments which could explain the contrasting emission changes for CH 4 due to storage covering. Similar to NH 3 , a larger layer thickness of straw covers leads to a higher emission reduction for CH 4 although the differences of the emissions are low (Guarino et al., 2006;VanderZaag et al., 2009).The observed increase in CH 4 emissions for plastic fabrics, expanded polystyrene and peat complies with the review of VanderZaag et al.

        <p>The contribution of the different gases to the total of GHG emissions is largest for CH 4 with a proportion of ca. 80% (VanderZaag et al., 2009;Petersen et al., 2013). Therefore, the changes of GHG equivalents due to effects of covers is moderate with a slight trend towards lower total GHG emissions. VanderZaag et al. (2010b) have shown that a permeable synthetic floating cover was more efficient regarding emission reduction of NH 3 and CH 4 when slurry is agitated as compared to undisturbed slurry. VanderZaag et al. (2009) found that agitation increased NH 3 losses from straw covered tanks less than from the uncovered reference. CH 4 emissions from covered and control tanks were similarly changed.The contribution of the different gases to the total of GHG emissions is largest for CH 4 with a proportion of ca. 80% (VanderZaag et al., 2009;Petersen et al., 2013).

        <p>Although found efficient in emission reduction, low cost floating covers such as straw covers are probably not efficient for emission mitigation in practice since they may be destroyed when the slurry surface is disturbed due to strong winds or operations at a store. Therefore, we consider impermeable structural covers or synthetic floating covers as most reliable for emission mitigation.Although found efficient in emission reduction, low cost floating covers such as straw covers are probably not efficient for emission mitigation in practice since they may be destroyed when the slurry surface is disturbed due to strong winds or operations at a store.

        <p>The emission data provided in records from different studies range over several orders of magnitude even for the same slurry type, the same type of study and identical seasons of measurement. This may be partly due to varying conditions related to manure management and meteorological conditions occurring during the measurements. In addition, different study designs and measuring methods are likely to contribute to the variability in emissions. An important issue in future research should thus focus to identify and quantify potential experimental biases. This aspect requires the simultaneous use of independent approaches to determine emissions.The emission data provided in records from different studies range over several orders of magnitude even for the same slurry type, the same type of study and identical seasons of measurement.

        <p>Farm-scale studies using non-intrusive methods such as micrometeorological mass balance (Wagner-Riddle et al., 2006) or dispersion modeling (Flesch et al., 2009) are likely to be a preferential option. Such approaches avoid interactions with emitting processes and determined emission rates best reflect the emissions occurring under conditions at farm-scale. They have the ability to cover large area sources (Gao et al., 2008) and can thus integrate the large inhomogeneity of emissions over space and time. For dispersion modeling, the limiting factor is the requirement of a simple topography allowing for representative turbulence measurements. Most of the micrometeorological methods require a minimum wind speed. Many sensors, e.g. for NH 3 , have a minimum detection limit which may be higher than gas concentrations occurring under conditions with low emissions (Balde et al., 2019). Consequently, farm-scale studies using non-intrusive methods have a risk to overestimate the true average emissions (Baldé et al., 2018). This risk can be minimized by using recently developed sensors such as DOAS systems (Volten et al., 2012;Bell et al., 2017). Moreover, it would be important to quantify such potential biases by an assessment of gap filling procedures used for missing data due to e.g. non-detection at low concentration levels as done by Voglmeier et al. (2018). For reliable results from farm-scale studies, extended measurement periods are required covering all seasons of a year. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated that the history of the storage may play an important role for CH 4 emissions (Kariyapperuma et al., 2018) pointing at the necessity of measurement campaigns over several years for an adequate determination of representative emission rates. This implies a large effort in labor and costs. In addition, thorough recording of the operations at the storage facilities (agitation, filling, discharging of the stores by using e.g. a webcam, continuous measuring of the slurry volume stored), of crusting at the stores surface (thickness, structure, coverage of the surface), of slurry temperature at several depths, of meteorological conditions as well as slurry sampling and analyses are required. A few studies comply with these requirements (e.g. Baldé et al., 2018;Kariyapperuma et al., 2018). Still, collection of such data can be challenging or even hardly feasible (e.g. representative slurry sampling at large lagoons). Also, operations at stores can largely differ between individual farms and consequently, it is difficult to select an experimental site at farm-scale which is appropriate to generate baseline emissions. Therefore, several measurement campaigns that consider the variety of different conditions occurring at slurry stores are required.Farm-scale studies using non-intrusive methods such as micrometeorological mass balance (Wagner-Riddle et al., 2006) or dispersion modeling (Flesch et al., 2009) are likely to be a preferential option.

        <p>Pilot-scale studies are indispensable for studying principal mechanisms and influencing factors driving emissions or to evaluate the effectiveness of emission mitigation techniques. Facilities allowing for continuous measurements e.g. as presented by Petersen et al. (2009) are probably the best option. Further advantages of pilot-scale studies are the possibility to conduct experiments in replicates and a better control of the experimental conditions. There is also a potential to generate bases for modeling which could be used to complement data from farmscale studies. Further progress for the quantification of emissions from slurry storage could be achieved by an analysis of individual measurement intervals from several experiments and model construction on this basis as e.g. done for slurry application by Hafner et al. (2019). The measurement intervals should include the relevant information regarding influencing factors. For this, we recommend that the researchers provide the emission data along with parameters as given in the Supplementary data 2. For indistinct parameters such as crusting, we suggest the elaboration of a standardized procedure to achieve a definition which reliably reflects its influence on the emission level.Pilot-scale studies are indispensable for studying principal mechanisms and influencing factors driving emissions or to evaluate the effectiveness of emission mitigation techniques.

        <p>The present article provides a comprehensive overview on published emission data from slurry storage which serves as a basis to determine guide values and baseline emissions for NH 3 , GHGs and H 2 S. Standardization of the emission data is an important issue in the present study due to the use of a large variety of units in the studies. Accompanying parameters (e.g. data on slurry analyses) were only partly available in the papers and could thus not be used for a more advanced data analysis. However, the season of the experimental period which served as a surrogate for the temperature was provided in most studies. Descriptive statistics of the emission data revealed a large variability for all gases. Data generated during warm, temperate and cold seasons are unevenly distributed over all records. Therefore, the calculation of an average annual value completed with a confidence range based on a weighting of the emission data according to the season and measurements duration was done. The baseline emissions on an area or volume basis determined for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons and tanks (Table 8) are mostly lower than existing reference values. NH 3 baseline emissions for tanks related to TAN are 16% of TAN (range: 14%-19% of TAN) and 15% TAN (range: 9.2%-23% of TAN) for cattle slurry and for pig slurry, respectively, and thus similar to emission factors used in emission inventory models. The flow-based baseline emissions for N 2 O and CH 4 are lower than current emission factors. Total GHG emissions from slurry stores based on the global warming potential using a 100-year time horizon are dominated by CH 4 .The present article provides a comprehensive overview on published emission data from slurry storage which serves as a basis to determine guide values and baseline emissions for NH 3 , GHGs and H 2 S.

        <p>Techniques for slurry treatment exhibit contrasting effects on emission levels during storage. Acidification was found to be efficient in reducing the emissions of NH 3 and CH 4 but less for CO 2 while the release of N 2 O was enhanced in few studies. Solid-liquid separation causes higher losses for NH 3 and a reduction in CH 4 , N 2 O and CO 2 emissions. Anaerobic digestion promoted NH 3 emissions in most studies. In contrast, emission changes during slurry storage were less explicit for CH 4 , although there is evidence toward an emission reduction. The effect of anaerobic digestion on N 2 O and CO 2 emissions is unclear. It is essential to consider the context of good management practices along the whole manure management chain when the effect of slurry treatments on emissions from slurry storage is assessed.Techniques for slurry treatment exhibit contrasting effects on emission levels during storage.

        <p>All storage cover types reduce emissions of NH 3 while the effect is small for CH 4 and CO 2 with a trend toward a reduction. Permeable covers increase emissions of N 2 O. Total GHG emissions tend to be lower with coverage of slurry stores.
