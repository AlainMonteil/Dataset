        <p>Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) is an emerging branch of sustainable forest management that aims to manage forests in response to climate change. Specific CSF strategies are viewed as a way forward for developing suitable management responses and enhancing the provision of ecosystem services. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive and cohesive assessment to implement CSF. This paper describes the step-by-step process that developed a comprehensive and shared definition of CSF, and the process for selecting indicators that assess the "climate-smartness" of forest management. Adaptation, mitigation and social dimensions are the core focus of the CSF definition, which recognises the need to integrate and avoid development of these aspects in isolation. An iterative participatory process was used with a range of experts in forest-related fields from the CLIMO project, this was subsequently supported by a network analysis to identify sustainable forest management indicators important to CSF. The definition developed here, is an important first step in to promote CSF that will aid practice in the forestry sector. It can be used as a template across Europe, tailored to local contexts. Further work communicating CSF to practitioners and policy-makers will create a CSF practice and culture that will help to safeguard future forest economies and communities.</p>
        <p>In recent years the term Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) has become increasingly common in forestry circles 2 permeating into academic and sector-specific culture (Hansen et al., 2010;Jantke et al., 2016;Nabuurs et 3 al., 2018;Yousefpour et al., 2018). The CSF concept is emerging as an important next step in furthering the 4 goals of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) and the sector's response to the threat of climate change. 5</p>
        <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) places great emphasis on forests and associated 6 activities, as crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change (IPCC, 2014). In order to meet the Paris 7</p>
        <p>Agreement goals, considerable contributions will be required from forests, as nations are simultaneously 8 aiming to reduce forest degradation and enhance carbon sinks (Rockström et al., 2017). As a consequence, 9 forests can be viewed as both an issue and a solution, with healthy and widely beneficial forests the 10 ultimate goal. 11</p>
        <p>Forestry has been placed at the forefront of action to mitigate climate change through afforestation and 12 carbon sequestration efforts (Bastin et al., 2019). Subsequent management strategies will be significant, as 13 these will determine and regulate emissions, as well as producing ecosystem services that will support and 14 enhance dependent communities. The visibility of action through afforestation provides clear metrics and 15 mitigation goals that currently align with the aims of many governments that are pledging to massive 16 planting commitments without future planning for these new forests. Planting alone does not guarantee 17 mitigation; careful establishment and subsequent management is required to support the forests, 18 communities and economies. CSF definition and indicators could be vitality important for guiding climate-19 smart decision-making. Moreover, they could be components of a broader landscape-scale strategy, which 20 continuously develops with complex socio-ecological systems to achieve sustainable development goals 21 (Denton et al., 2014). Coordination and collaboration between stakeholders to create a shared vision is 22 paramount to achieving such goals (Folke et al., 2010;Kok et al., 2014). Often institutional and technical 23 capacities need to develop with working concepts such as CSF to help assess and promote effective 24 application by stakeholders. 25</p>
        <p>The climate-smart concept originated with agriculture (FAO, 2010a) and recognises the need for "an 27 approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to effectively 28 support development and ensure food security in a changing climate." This approach, which is adopted by 29 Nabuurs et al. (2018) with regard to forestry, describes three main objectives using climate-smart 30 agriculture as a template: (i) sustainably increasing production and incomes; (ii) adapting and building 31 resilience; and (iii) reducing or removing GHG emissions (FAO, 2010a;Zilberman et al., 2018). Nabuurs and 32 colleagues (2018) focus on the third objective of reducing or removing GHG emissions through forestry. 33</p>
        <p>A Web of Science database query with the keywords 'Climate-Smart Forest' resulted in 106 publications 34 since 2000 (Figure S1) with only four articles explicitly addressing the subject of Europe as the main focus of the articles (Jandl et al., 2018;Nabuurs et al., 2018Nabuurs et al., , 2017;;Yousefpour et al., 36 2018). CSF literature over the last eighteen years addressed a number of issues including GHG emissions 37 (Yousefpour et al., 2018) carbon sequestration with a strong cluster of publications on REDD+ (Nabuurs et 38 al., 2018;Vass and Elofsson, 2016), land use and habitat change (Pussinen et al., 2009;Smiraglia et al., 39 2016) impact on tree species diversity/distribution and forest structure (Del Río et al., 2016), wildfire 40 regimes (Fernandes, 2013;Sousa-Silva et al., 2018) and the resulting effects on management and decision-41 making (Hansen et al., 2010). Beyond the CSF concept, there is an emerging area focusing on mobile 42 applications that collect forest data through citizen science and professional monitoring networks (Yang et 43 al., 2015). A thorough analysis of the CSF related literature is provided in Appendix A of supplementary 44 material. 45 No widely adopted definition currently exists for CSF, therefore, the term is being interpreted in a number 46 of ways, which mostly focus on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and effective carbon 47 sequestration, as the core mitigation actions (Nabuurs et al., 2018;Yousefpour et al., 2018). Socio-48 ecological systems have mostly not been addressed so far in CSF with the majority of studies based on 49 modelling techniques mainly addressing carbon sequestration, substitution and climate impacts (Nabuurs 50 et al., 2018;Yousefpour et al., 2018). For this reason, practical guidance for assessing and implementing 51 This paper presents, for the first time, a broad definition of CSF, which can be subjected to further testing 76 and verification. The definition was developed through an iterative deliberative process that involved 77 confrontation among a multidisciplinary group of experts from 28 countries (http://climo.unimol.it/) 78 participating in the COST action CA 15226, Climate-Smart Forestry in Mountain Regions (CLIMO). 79 Developed for policy-makers and practitioners, the CSF definition initially aimed to guide European 80 forestry, but can also be used as a template in other areas of the world. Moreover, the paper describes the 81 process used to select indicators, enabling assessment of the climate-smartness of forests in support of 82 SFM and limiting the negative impacts induced by climate change. Section 2 describes the definition 83 building process as well as the methodology for the network analysis of the SFM indicators. The results of 84 the network analysis and the CSF definition are described in the section 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. Section 4 85 discusses the implications for European forestry and climate policy, while outlining further work and next 86 steps. Section 5 covers conclusions. 87</p>
        <p>The CSF definition process involved participants of the EU COST Action CLIMO during and between three 90 separate meetings (Table S1). Deliberative processes are used in diverse environments from shaping of 91 international policy to decision-making at a community level with the aim to build common consensus on a 92 wide range of perspectives, leading to collective agreements and actions (Dietz, 2013;Wolf and Klein, 93 2007). Development of the CSF definition for CSF and relevant indicators for monitoring and assessment 94 (Figure 1), aims to build a guiding framework for future research, practice and policy. 95</p>
        <p>The multidisciplinary background of CLIMO forest professionals fostered an iterative and discursive 96 participatory approach that has proven effective for forest governance and wider decision-making 97 processes. This enabled participants to share views on forest management and CSF, identifying important 98 linkages between SFM and forest ecosystem services that would prove beneficial for CSF . 99 Säynäjoki (2014) suggests that confrontation of perspectives is a key stage for groups that aim to elicit and 100 examine individual reasoning, allowing for broader reflection on complex issues. Therefore, the definition 101 was tested and challenged over the series of meetings (Table S1) until a consensus was reached with the 102 current version. These meetings were part of a longer process planned to take the definition from an initial 103 concept inspired by Climate-Smart Agriculture and the Forest Europe C&amp;I for SFM, through this initial 104 definition. Further amendments are envisioned after consultation with policymakers and practitioners with 105 the ultimate aim of developing a CSF toolkit for forest managers. 106</p>
        <p>[Insert Figure 1 here] 107</p>
        <p>At the inaugural meeting (Trento, Italy, February 2017), Working Group (WG1) was formed to develop a 108 comprehensive definition for CSF and to identify criteria for CSF assessment and monitoring to generate 109 baselines for future research, practice and policy. Working Group 1 was the largest of four working groups 110 with a diverse range of participants with backgrounds ranging from forest management to ecophysiology 111 and ecology, from soil science to forest policy, as well as genetics and landscape management (Table S2 -112</p>
        <p>Appendix B, in Supplementary material). In the first meeting, the general aim and methodology for 113 reaching a definition and selecting criteria were discussed. A sub-group of WG1, with members from the 114 COST Action CORE group and participants from other working groups, was established with the specific task 115 of developing a CSF definition. This sub-group met in Sofia (Bulgaria) in September 2017 to produce a 116 preliminary (incomplete) draft of a one-page definition. This was shared by email for consultation and 117 amendment first with the sub-group participants who had not been able to attend, and second with all 118 members of the COST Action between October 2017 and February 2018. In February 2018, the sub-group 119 reconvened at the annual CLIMO meeting in Sofia to come up with a first full draft that could be presented 120 during the plenary session to all participants. 121 At the end of the third meeting, the definition was challenged, in an open discussion, by representatives 122 from each WG by providing comments, suggestions and amendments that had been compiled and 123 synthesised from each separate WG. These were presented to WG1 and discussed until a 124 consensus/agreement was reached to either integrate, modify or reject the proposed changes. This 125 confrontational method allowed all suggestions to be put forward for debate, defence and negotiation, 126 which is an increasingly necessary stage for contentious issues and areas of uncertainty (Mavrommati et al., 127 2017;Pellow, 1999;Runhaar et al., 2016). This important step ensured that expectations, inherent bias and 128 agendas were challenged, so that the definition can be judged to be developed through a comprehensive, 129 transparent, legitimate and effective process. 130</p>
        <p>A high number of CLIMO members actively participated in the development of the definition. Overall, 48 131 members contributed from 19 countries with a range of expertise and management experience (Table S2 -132</p>
        <p>Appendix B, in Supplementary material). 133</p>
        <p>Since the 1990s, many international processes developed principles, C&amp;I to support SFM worldwide 135 (Castañeda, 2000). In Europe, the pan-European set of C&amp;I for SFM is considered one of the most important 136 tools for assessing, monitoring and reporting on SFM, and is implemented widely among European 137 countries (Santopuoli et al., 2016;Wolfslehner and Baycheva-Merger, 2016). 138 Indicators for assessing CSF include adaptation and mitigation strategies, and also consider the multiple 139 benefits that forests provide to society. The CLIMO partners agreed to identify CSF indicators, from the 140 pan-European set ( The Analytic Network Analysis was implemented to identify the most relevant indicators for assessing CSF. 159 In particular, a Two-mode network analysis was performed in 
            <rs type="software">UCINET</rs> software to manage the two sets of 160 separate entities (Hanneman and Riddle, 2005), specifically SFM indicators and forest ecosystem services. 161
        </p>
        <p>This approach is similar to that undertaken by others using C&amp;I for selecting indicators of SFM through a 162 participatory approach (Mendoza and Prabhu, 2000;Santopuoli et al., 2012), and support decision making 163 in SFM (Wolfslehner et al., 2005;Wolfslehner and Vacik, 2011). Centrality measures, such as degree, k-core, 164 betweenness and closeness were calculated to weight and classify indicators into groups of CSF relevance. 165 Additionally, key arguments from CLIMO participants in response to the group's discussion and debate of 166 indicators, iteratively contributed to shape the CSF definition. 167</p>
        <p>Results were displayed as a network through a fuzzy cognitive map carried out with 
            <rs type="software">NetDraw</rs> software 168 (Borgatti et al., 2002). Indicators and forest ecosystem services are the nodes of the network, while the ties 169 reflect the suitability of indicators to monitor adaptation, mitigation or both, as well as the forest 170 ecosystem services they address. In the two-mode network, the ties are unidirectional flowing, from the 171 indicators to ecosystem services, therefore no connections between nodes of the same entity (i.e., among 172 indicators) exist. Further details about network analysis and structure can be found in the Annex C in 173 Supplementary material. 174
        </p>
        <p>Twenty-three forest-related ecosystem services were selected and used in the CSF assessment (Table 2). 177</p>
        <p>Twelve out of 23 belong to the regulating section, six to the provisioning and five to the cultural section. 178 However, regulating (i.e., sequestration, biological control, and refugia) and provisional services (i.e., raw 179 materials and PBP) were highly connected with most of the indicators (Figure 2 and Figure S3). By contrast, 180 cultural ecosystem services, such as spiritual, recreation, tourism and aesthetic, were slightly less 181 connected. 182</p>
        <p>Results show that a total of 29 indicators were selected by participants as suitable to assess adaptation and 183 mitigation, then were subsequently used to perform the network analysis. Twenty-five of these indicators 184 came from the original 34 for SFM, plus the four new indicators identified by the participants (Table 2). 185</p>
        <p>Seven indicators of criterion 6 -socio-economic function (i.e., 6.1 forest holdings, 6.2 contribution of forest 186 sector to GDP, 6.3 net revenue, 6.4 expenditure for services, 6.5 forest sector force, 6.6 occupational safety 187 and health, and 6.11 cultural and spiritual values) and two indicators of criterion 3 -forest productivity (i.e., 188 3.3 non-wood goods, and 3.4 services) were not selected. This highlights that many socio-economic aspects 189 were lost when considering adaptation and mitigation as central pillars of CSF (for the group of experts 190 consulted). 191</p>
        <p>The centrality variables (Table 3) 3 here] 200 Four groups have been identified based on the centrality values (Table 3) and the position of nodes in the 201 network (Figure 2). 202</p>
        <p>This group includes 12 indicators with higher centrality values (Table 3) This group is composed of a single indicator, 6.10 accessibility for recreation, mainly due to the marginal 232 position rather than the relatively low centrality values. However, the marginal position on one hand and 233 the power of connection with cultural ecosystem services on the other identifies accessibility as peripheral 234 indicator. This does not diminish its important role for assessing CSF, particularly in mountain forests for 235 which forest roads are crucial not only for recreation purposes but also to ensure harvesting activities (i.e., 236 sanitary interventions), counteract forest fires and reduce forest management costs. 237</p>
        <p>Results highlighted perspectives of CLIMO participants with regard to monitoring and promoting CSF. 238</p>
        <p>During the analysis the main themes which emerged from the participatory process and network analysis 239 (Figure 3), are summarised below: 240 Therefore, rapid action that fosters greater understanding of climate induced changes will require 262 meaningful cooperation between practitioners and policy-makers. Communication of relevant advances in 263 the field is needed to address these issues with targeted knowledge and management approaches that can 264 be applied and adapted to local areas. In order to continually refine the assessment of CSF indicators and to 265 promote communication among policy-makers, forest researchers and practitioners, a CSF approach that 266 develops understanding and impact needs to be established. 267</p>
        <p>In section 3.1, indicators considered central to adaptation and mitigation for forests (carbon stock and 268 growing stock: see Figure 2) were identified as peripheral for CSF, whereas core group indicators were 269 more explicitly related to human activities, management actions and interventions (fragmentation, wood 270 consumption, wood energy and management plans etc.). These focus on the combined processes and 271 interactions between forests and human intervention through forestry activities. However, indicators such 272 as trade in wood, roundwood, as well as increment and felling fall within the 1 st peripheral group despite 273 their association with management. Linser et al. (2018) stress that the discussion around SFM will 274 continually evolve and respond to socio-economic aspects and emerging challenges. Therefore, subsets of 275 indicators might be necessary to link with other sectors or tailored to fit particular issues such as climate 276 change. CSF indicators may change with the input from more diverse range of stakeholders or more 277 focussed geographical ranges. This paper differs from those of Nabuurs (2018;2017) and Yousefpour 278 (2018) as it includes adaptation and mitigation as broad frameworks, and emphasises the importance of 279 the social dimensions of forestry. Additionally, this study includes a core set of CSF indicators that could 280 guide managers and policy-makers to more climate-smart practices, enhancing climate adaptation of 281 forests and the provision of ecosystem services. Central indicators promote forest biodiversity conservation 282 and sustainable management of forest resources that fit with the demand of both the forest sector and 283 wider public. 284 Jandl et al. (2018) conclude that the production of long living wood products (i.e., construction timber) is a 285 favourable strategy for CSF wherein carbon is stored in longer standing trees and products. This supports 286 the centrality of the wood consumption indicator, which takes into account the use of wood and the types 287 of products that would be favourable to CSF. However, some issues are related to the risk to long-term 288 standing trees from episodic disturbances and the fact that long-standing timber slows carbon capture in 289 comparison to new forests (Harmon and Campbell, 2017;Jandl et al., 2018). The relationship between tree 290 carbon and resulting soil carbon capture is viewed as positive for CSF even though tree carbon capture 291 slows with time, soil carbon is generally recognised to increase. In spite of this widely accepted view, Ji et 292 al. (2017) present evidence for accumulation of soil carbon peaks in temperate broadleaf forests in stands 293 around 50 years of age during the pre-mature stage, with general decreases thereafter. This further 294 emphasises the importance of adapting CSF recommendations to regional or local context. Scenarios of CSF 295 are based upon trade-offs and decision-making processes, suitable to the socio-economic systems and 296 ecological lifecycles. As an example, early thinning can be viewed as an integral stage of forest production 297 to supply bioenergy (woodfuel), substituting the use of fossil fuels, while supporting growth of higher 298 quality and economically valuable final timber crop (roundwood) (Bowditch et al., 2019;Jandl et al., 2018;299 Röser et al., 2011). Managing woody biomass, for example, may reduce the risk of large catastrophic 300 wildfires and alter the flow rates of watercourses during extreme weather conditions (droughts, heat 301 waves, rainstorms and strong winds) to reduce flooding risk. The potential impact of a wood energy 302 indicator through management and use would explain the importance within the network analysis. 303</p>
        <p>Developing CSF resources to contextualise the indicators, especially at a local level, will require collection of 304 data from long-term monitoring plots, creation of new plots to evaluate targeted attributes at both the 305 stand and landscape level, which will enable the analyses of trends in CSF indicators to identify priority 306 areas for adaptation and mitigation. Trends in CSF indicators could also be mapped out through the 307 trajectory of scenarios that either implement CSF or alternative management actions (Yousefpour et al., 308 2010). Other tools, such as the European network of marteloscope sites, are being used to gather historic 309 and baseline data, as well as being deployed for forestry training activities (Santopuoli et al., 2019). These 310 sites have the potential to play a crucial role in testing SFM indicators through the simulation of various 311 forestry scenarios, as well as maintaining and evaluating time series data from sites that quantify 312 vulnerability to climate change. 313 Mina et al. (2017) observed that climate change projections under different management scenarios have 314 highly variable impacts on the provision of ecosystem services in mountains areas, subject to regional and 315 site conditions, as well as future climate responses. Therefore, establishment of connected and comparable 316 demonstration sites and permanent forest plots focused upon collection of CSF indicator data over 317 geographically distributed areas will aid monitoring of vital climate change impacts on forest ecosystems 318 (e.g., Instruction on Site Characteristic in measurements in Forests (ICOS)). Nevertheless, long-term plots 319 can only approximate certain trade-offs without greater accountability of disturbances and pressures that 320 change responses (Locatelli et al., 2017). In some areas, such as mountain regions, vulnerability to climate 321 change and everyday pressures will place forestry at the centre of an integrated social-ecological support 322 system that enhances economic opportunity and boosts resilience to the uncertainty of climate induced 323 changes (Schultz et al., 2015). Therefore, planning and management strategies would benefit from co-324 development with local populations to ensure investment and recognition of human-forest key 325 relationship. 326</p>
        <p>Each country and region will interpret definitions, principles and indicators differently, as diverse forest 328 types and tree species, ecosystems, socio-economic conditions, and people will vary. These will be 329 especially prevalent in critical or more sensitive areas, such as European mountains (Lexer and Bugmann, 330 2017). As the need for action against climate change heightens, greater guidance will be needed at all 331 scales from international policy to individual forest managers. A keystone development to bridging the gap 332 between policy and practice will be effective engagement with forest managers, forest communities and 333 different forest owner types to assess the accessibility of CSF indicators. Implementing locally adapted CSF 334 through diverse interactive methods aims to help sustainable communities develop alongside a productive 335 forest resource. Andersson and Keskitalo (2018) state that actions must be achieved through social rather 336 than environmental logics, as internal institutional systems, motivations and incentives will often steer and 337 limit adaptation conceived by external drivers and influences. Mitigation strategies that dominate high-338 level policy should be balanced and aligned with development of lower level actions, so regional nuance of 339 both the culture and managed environment are captured, and reflected in 'applied or working ' policy. 340 Additionally, over-dependency on carbon sequestration and storage as a panacea to climate-induced 341 changes could seriously overshadow adaptive capacity on regional and local scales inhibiting small 342 innovations and planning strategies that could contribute cumulatively to the global issue (Bull et al., 2018;343 Frame et al., 2018;Thornton and Comberti, 2017). 344 CSF adaptation measures can include the aim to improve management of specific species mixtures to 345 maintain production under a changing climate, as well as maintaining or increasing associated biodiversity 346 (Del Río et al., 2016, 2014;Nabuurs et al., 2018;Pretzsch et al., 2017), which could simultaneously support 347 the social dimensions of these forests for resilient communities (Armatas et al., 2016;Brunner and Grêt-348 Regamey, 2016;Seidl et al., 2016). A mixed species approach can be used to buffer but not entirely protect 349 against conditions resulting from climate change, however, the complementarity of mixed species 350 outperforms block mixtures under most climate change scenarios (Paul et al., 2019). Many forests will be in 351 vulnerable climatic zones with concentrated climate induced changes impacting species mixes, habitat 352 suitability and ultimately shifting distribution ranges. Nevertheless these changes may favour and provide 353 new production opportunities for some regions (Lindner et al., 2014). This may represent an important 354 revenue source for local economies, especially for communities suffering from depopulation, as well as a 355 lack of services and infrastructure (structural and business) that supports community development. 356 However, most predictions cite the reduction of species range and consequently lower production as more 357 probable (Liang et al., 2016), which makes conservation and enhancement of current native forest mixtures 358</p>
        <p>One way of furthering resilience and adaptability of native forest diversity is to improve connectivity and 360 migration corridors of key species and forest structures to sustain the availability of seed sources, as well as 361 genetic variation (Yang et al., 2015). Such adaption and response to climate induced change embraces the 362 multifunctionality of forests, which must be reflected in management approaches and cultural integration 363 (Halofsky et al., 2018). In Finland, forest owners show a willingness to participate in PES schemes aimed at 364 reducing wider-landscape risks of pests and diseases, as long as it provides some management flexibility 365 and does not unnecessarily prohibit forest operations that produce revenue and improved end crop yields 366 (Sheremet et al., 2018). This approach demonstrates a step towards customising PES to fit individuals and 367 regional differences through a common goal that binds forest owners over large landscapes (Curtin, 2014). 368</p>
        <p>A similar tailored PES model could be used for CSF guided by indicators and local priorities that taps into 369 important issues for managers. 370 CSF mitigation focusses upon carbon sequestration and storage, timber product use, bioenergy growth and 371 use, and the interactions between lifecycles to optimise carbon neutral activity. Therefore, reconciling and 372 aligning these sometimes-competing activities will be a crucial step. However, the focus on tangible metrics 373 currently dominating the CSF (Nabuurs et al., 2018(Nabuurs et al., , 2017) could be a limiting factor in developing future CSF 374 strategies. Carbon sequestration is a now widely accepted substantive mitigation mechanism, as trade-offs 375 in decision-making and resultant management activities are measurable, such as yield increment, revenue 376 variability and the use of various silvicultural approaches. Greater recognition of forest planning and 377 diverse forestry approaches in mitigation strategies should be integrated into CSF. In fact, these actions 378 underpin carbon sequestration and storage, as well as adaptation issues, which will cumulatively impact the 379 rest of the supply chain and forest-dependent communities who are supported economically and socially 380 by a range of ecosystem services (Brang et al., 2014;Colloff et al., 2016;Nagel et al., 2017). 381</p>
        <p>Ecosystem services assessment has been identified as a tool that could link stakeholders with management 382 practices and CSF governance, a visible action and beneficial outcome that strongly relates to social 383 dimensions of CSF. Therefore, PES, conservation partnerships and bridging organisations with local 384 stakeholder expertise could play an important capacity building role (Cockburn et al., 2016;Lange et al., 385 2016;Rouillard et al., 2015). Creating and maintaining social capital, such as knowledge exchange, 386 upskilling, technological development and use, as well as better monitoring and reporting to aid adaptive 387 learning (Curtin, 2014;Lawrence, 2017) could be key components of assessing the social dimensions of CSF. 388</p>
        <p>The CSF definition and subsequent development of applicable C&amp;I guidance aim to support livelihoods of 389 sustainable communities based on production, conservation and well-being. 390 Key features to creating an implementation pathway for CSF should include management and connectivity 391 of large datasets for long-term monitoring to track and understand the biophysical processes and changing 392 trends. These features will be supported by openly accessible data, guidance on use, and landscape scale 393 data that can distil into customisable tools for managers, as well as into coherent points of collaboration 394 and transparency between policy and practice (Nabuurs et al., 2019). 395</p>
        <p>European policy should aim to be comprehensive and flexible enough to include broad actions and 397 strategies with locally tailored solutions for regions and individual countries. A survey by Sousa-Silva et al. 398 (2018) explored forest managers views on climate change over seven European countries. These managers 399 recognised the potential impact of climate change but had little awareness of how to respond to threats or 400 implement adaptive management measures. This is supported by Coll et al. (2018) who's work identified 401 forest managers lack of knowledge regarding adaptability and trade-offs to environmental change in mixed-402 species forests. A CSF toolkit that uses the definition and indicators identified through the analysis 403 presented here could be used as a base to address the knowledge/information gap between science and 404 practice. 405</p>
        <p>Developing CSF from the bottom-up using experience of forest managers will be central to shaping best 406 practice from current adaptive management implementation and applied learning. On the international 407 level, forestry is increasingly viewed as one of the most effective ways to mitigate climate change (Bastin et 408 al., 2019;Chazdon and Brancalion, 2019;FAO, 2010b), however, the discussion between forest accounting 409 being based upon past management activities and prospective management is ongoing (Grassi et al., 2018). 410</p>
        <p>Establishing different management approaches that deviate from the status quo has been challenging in 411 regard to PES, as integrating clear and trusted verification processes and documenting an agreed baseline 412 from where alternative management diverges is difficult to implement on a wide-scale (Kang et al., 2019). 413</p>
        <p>European forests have been proposed to improve the prediction of stand dynamics and forest productivity 415 (Bussotti and Pollastrini, 2017). Under the Paris Agreement a flexible approach toward baseline accounting 416 of past management that supports changes that increase production, forest health and forest community 417 resilience, would reflect a middle ground or best of both world's scenarios. 418</p>
        <p>Mismatches in communication and failed initiatives often originate from narrow scope and a lack of vital 419 information. Therefore, combining social sciences with more traditional areas of forest science could help 420 avoid issues that perpetuate problems (Duckett et al., 2016). Recognising and integrating novel factors such 421 as social territories and scales, based upon core social-ecological systems, could identify key intervention 422 points that help enhance our ability to manage forests and avoid future spatial, temporal and political 423 mismatches (Fischer, 2018). In Melnykovych et al. (2018) community members showed interest in 424 designing and implementing the sustainable forest policy measures that managed the provision of 425 ecosystem services and enhanced well-being. However, these aspirations were tempered by the need to 426 prioritise income generation and daily management actions. This underlines the need to develop resilience 427 with local community sustainable development goals, as well as balance long-term policy goals with short-428 term needs of the locality (Bull et al., 2018). An approach that operates through co-design and production 429 may have a greater chance of creating CSF framework with bespoke set-ups for different regions, 430 ownership and forest types. 431 CSF definitions, guidance and tools generated by such projects as CLIMO could help refine the approach to 432 forestry as a more sophisticated mitigation measure encouraging socio-economic growth and innovation. 433 CSF should endeavour to take a systemic approach rather than treating individual symptoms, looking to the 434 long-term health and resilience of forest ecosystems, which includes people as a central component. 435 Ollikainen (2014) states that the EU Bioeconomy Action Plan fails to take account of the forestry sector's 436 link to climate change and superficially addresses the land use management dynamics that are vital for 437 developing climate-smart policy. Such criticism highlights crucial gaps in the connectivity of European 438 strategies (Forestry, Bioeconomy, and Climate etc.) that could potentially be addressed and informed by 439 further developed CSF definitions, guidelines and toolkits, which aim to enhance the science/policy 440 interface. However, Hodge et al. (2017) emphasises that bioeconomy already acts as a bridging concept, 441 bringing forestry and climate change closer together rather than dividing them into separate branches that 442 operate in isolation. Using an umbrella concept, such as bioeconomy, which can be inclusive and 443 comprehensive, can also embed broad-bush approaches that overlook key implementation issues in 444 specific sectors. 445 Additionally, such concepts as bioeconomy are dominated by economic, resource use and commodity 446 concerns, which have the tendency to neglect social and ecological considerations (Karvonen et al., 2017), 447 such as high-level governance and local participation (Pülzl et al., 2014). These have been recognised as key 448 elements of the CSF approach and, therefore, should be highlighted as important considerations for 449 translating bioeconomy impacts into relatable regional versions. Bioeconomy could be an important 450 concept in halting the reduction of biodiversity and ecosystem services flows, which rely on balancing the 451 effective integration of social-ecological, cultural and economic dimensions alongside the management of 452 natural resources that are subject to uncertain changes (Marchetti et al., 2014). Therefore, CSF as defined 453 here, offers a legitimate and inclusive discourse linking energy, carbon, production, biodiversity 454 conservation and resilient communities; supported by scientific evidence and metrics that can provide 455 implementation options and guide management goals. Market inclusion and transparency of climate 456 impact and risk to key environments from increasing climate-induced changes will be crucial to avoiding 457 economic recession, therefore markets need to take more responsibility and support PES and CSF or risk 458 further loss of vital ecosystem services (Griffin, 2020). To achieve such goals specific evidence and 459 management roadmaps are needed to give policy the necessary teeth to affect wide-ranging change that 460 will reach and work with individual forest managers. 461</p>
        <p>When approaching any type of definition or guidance for a wide range of stakeholders over large 463 geographical areas there will be limitations, as well as scope for improvement and further development. 464 Strengthening our definition and set of indicators for CSF will be the next steps, as the participatory process 465 was represented by a group of mostly forest research professionals, although these were geographically 466 dispersed with a range of expertise, which substantiates the broad European approach. Including forestry 467 industry professionals and practitioners in the refinement of the definition and indicators is the next step 468 and currently forest managers and professionals in 20 countries of the CLIMO network are responding to 469 the CSF definition and indicators to inform the next iteration and potential steps for tailoring at regional 470 levels. 471</p>
        <p>Aligning the CSF indicators with available data from European forest monitoring networks and National 472 Forest Inventories data will allow for creation of baselines and historical analysis of trends toward climate 473 smartness and the corresponding management actions. Lorente et al. ( 2018) created a web-based platform 474 to display and communicate a set forest indicators for climate change. However, they acknowledged 475 further refinement at the regional level and greater consideration of socio-economic factors, as well as 476 partnership and engagement with practitioners would enhance the impact and utility of the indicators. 477 Indicators for the transition from a federal to a hybrid social forestry governance structure in the USA were 478 developed focussing upon partnership, collaboration and institutional innovations (Abrams et al., 2019). 479</p>
        <p>This work provides the opportunity to map changes in governance patterns of forest units over spatial and 480 temporal scales but also allows for analysis of capacity building and institutional infrastructure required to 481 support these transitions. However, the authors also recognised the importance of understanding how 482 changes in governance influenced and impacted ecological change to enhance the stewardship function 483 increasing resilience and ecological integrity (Cannon et al., 2018). Such steps will be key for CSF to 484 establish a sound platform of communication and dissemination between practice and policy, shaping clear 485 linkages that can be understood and interpreted by both managers and policy-makers. 486</p>
        <p>Finer detail of data collection to recognise the importance of local management systems that work within 487 SFM indicators has been highlighted in northern Italy by demonstrating the complex socio-economic 488 dynamics of coppice management systems that support a historic and wider economy (Riccioli et al., 2019). 489 Despite the peripheral location of cultural indicators in this paper the definition reconciles the importance 490 of social dimensions including socio-economics in supporting and promoting CSF. Further work around 491 cultural and socio-economic indicators will be required perhaps as a linking sub-set of indicators that 492 facilitates the key channel of communication between managers and policy-makers. 493</p>
        <p>494 Promoting CSF will require more time to build effective working relationships between stakeholders and 495 policymakers cultivating the trust needed to realise these strategies, recommendations and best practice 496 guidance (Lange et al., 2016). Improved communication and use of expansive participatory methods to 497 engage and interact with forest managers will play a key role in this process and naturalising what may be 498 seen by many, as "another recycled concept" into practice and common vocabulary of the practitioner. 499</p>
        <p>Advancing CSF processes, beginning with baseline definitions, testing of indicators through key sites, 500 monitoring and experimental data will be influential in developing and progressing climate change policy, 501 such as the Paris Agreement. This paper offers a potential roadmap and process to implementing CSF 502 starting from the definition and indicators with the aim of expanding our understanding of management 503 and decision-making challenges that can be ultimately refined into tool that delivers on SFM goals. This 504 paper is an important first step in offering a CSF definition and indicators that can be used as a template on 505 a European level and adapted to localities to provide much needed guidance for managing more resilient 506 forests and practicing CSF. However, engaging forest managers and wider stakeholders of forest 507 communities will be central to developing, testing and refining further steps that aim to produce a valuable 508 resource for forest practitioners to enhance the management of their forests in response to future 509 uncertainty and growing demands on these forests. 510</p>

The iterative deliberative process conducted in CLIMO with a confrontation stage that 792 engaged all working groups to account for any issues, difference of opinions and new information. 793 Climate-smart forestry is sustainable adaptive forest management and governance to protect and enhance the potential of forests to adapt to, and mitigate climate change. The aim is to sustain ecosystem integrity and functions and to ensure the continuous delivery of ecosystem goods and services, while minimising the impact of climate-induced changes on mountain forests on well-being and nature's contribution to people.</p>
        <p>Adaptation measures of forests that maintain or improve their ability to grow under current and projected climatic conditions and increase their resistance and resilience. The adaptive capacity to changes in climate and to the timing and size of climate-induced disturbances (e.g., fire, extreme storm events, pests and diseases) can be enhanced by promoting genetic, compositional, structural, and functional diversity at both stand and landscape scales. This includes facilitating natural regeneration and planting of native as well as non-native tree species, genetic variants and individuals that are considered to be adapted to future conditions. Increased connectivity assists the migration of forest species.</p>
        <p>Mitigation of climate change by forests is a combination of carbon sequestration by trees, carbon storage by forest ecosystems, especially soils, and forest derived products, such as structural timber, and by carbon substitution -directly by replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy and indirectly through use of wood to substitute for higher carbon footprint materials.</p>
        <p>The social dimension of forestry holds many aspects, from the involvement of stakeholders from local communities, and their conflicts over land use or for the access to skills and technology, to global forest governance challenges. Climate change may jeopardize forest ecosystem functioning and brings social and economic consequences for people, which may modify priorities of ecosystem services at various scales. Assessment for ecosystem services could be a tool making this process more efficient with respect to indicators relevant for governance regime and actors involved.</p>
        <p>In summary, climate-smart forestry should enable both forests and society to transform, adapt to and mitigate climate-induced changes.</p>

        <p>However, this study restricts the interpretation solely to agricultural values and thus omits wider economic, 33 environmental and social potential. Yang et al. (2015) focus on the potential impact of species 34 'adaptational lag' to changes in and maintaining the productive stock and genetic variety of black spruce 35</p>

They weighted their indicators to represent management functions considered 64 more important in a local or regional context, such as mountain forests, and recognised the protective 65 function as the highest priority. This approach provides a basic flexibility to take into account more area-66 specific requirements and changing management objectives over diverse landscapes. However, this 67 approach should be investigated further to refine and expand the flexibility. 68</p>
        <p>In summary, these papers on CSF highlight the need for collaboration across boundaries and over large 69 spatial scales to ensure the productivity and functionality of forests into the future (Anton et al., 2010;70 Curtin, 2014;Johansson, 2016)</p>

        <p>The analytic network analysis allows to assess pairwise relationships between objects and entities of a 123 network to identify trends and patterns. In this study, the entities are two important tools that deal with 124 where ∂st is the number of shortest paths from s to t, and ∂st(v) is the number of shortest paths from s 158 to t that pass through a vertex v. 159  K-core consists in the identification of particular subsets of the network. A k-core is a maximal 160 group of actors, all of which are connected to some number (k) of other members of the group. If 161 an actor has ties to a sufficient number of members of a group, they may feel tied to that group, 162 even if they do not know many, or even most members. It may be that identity depends on 163 connection, rather than on immersion in a sub-group. 164</p>
