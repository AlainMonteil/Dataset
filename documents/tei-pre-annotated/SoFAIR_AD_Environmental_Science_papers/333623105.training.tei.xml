        <p>This review aimed to analyse the current state of management practices for poultry manure in Poland and present future perspectives in terms of technologies allowing closing the loops for circular economy, and thus recovery of nutrients and energy. The scope of the review focused primarily on: (1) the analysis of poultry production and generation of poultry manure with special references to quantities, properties (e.g. fertilizing properties), seasonality, etc.; (2) the overview of current practices and methods for managing poultry manure including advantages and limitations; (3) the analysis of potential and realistic threats and risk related to managing poultry manure, and also (4) the analysis of promising technologies for converting poultry manure into added value products and energy. The review addressed the following technologies: composting of poultry manure to obtain fertilizers and soil improvers, anaerobic digestion of poultry manure for energy recovery, and also pyrolysis of poultry manure into different types of biochar that can be applied in agriculture, horticulture and industry. Poultry manure is rich in macro-and micronutrients but also can contain various contaminants such as antibiotics or pesticides, and thus posing a realistic threat to soil and living organisms when applied to soil directly or after biological treatment. The main challenge in poultry manure processing is to assure sufficient closing of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous loops and safe application to soil.</p>
        <p>Poland is one of the major leaders in poultry production in Europe. Production of poultry is estimated on average at 4 mln ton per yearthis included broiler chickens and turkeys, and egg-laying hens (Ta� nczuk et al., 2019a,b;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019b). The number of poultry farms in Poland has been gradually increasing since a decade. This in turn, has resulted in even higher quantities of poultry manure that need to be properly managed, either on site through available technologies or in more centralized approach e.g. in composting facilities, biogas plants or other.</p>
        <p>Poultry manure is rich in nitrogen but also contains significant quantities of phosphorous and potassium. Due to the composition and the content of selected nutrients poultry manure can be applied as a fertilizer to improve soil properties and fertility. However, with increasing quantities of poultry manure in Poland there is no sufficient agricultural land for application of poultry manure. Excessive quantities of poultry manure require transportation, storage and further handling and/or processing. Uncontrolled management of poultry manure can cause emission of methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia into the atmosphere. What is more, poultry manure applied to soil in excess and in uncontrolled manner can pose a serious threat to soil and water environment.</p>
        <p>Therefore, managing poultry manure requires a complex approach. There is a number of available technologies that would allow recovery of nutrients and energy from poultry manure on site using the infrastructure of poultry farms. However, some of those already commercially available technologies would require the adjustments of farm infrastructure and substantial capital investment. Complex approach to efficient management of poultry manure would require overcoming a number of obstacles that include handling and transportation, changes in the type and composition of poultry manure due to seasonality and breeding regime, demand for products obtained from poultry manure such as fertilizers and soil improvers, and also technological, e.g. high moisture content and structure of poultry manure, technological operations, e.g. pre-treatments and post-treatments, etc. There are many ongoing research projects in Polish research and academic institutions aiming at developing novel and more efficient technologies for converting poultry manure into energy or added value products. The research has been driven by the concept of a poultry biorefineryan approach to manage and process poultry manure on site for energy and nutrient recovery and production of added value products. However, this concept has not been fully explored in terms of its potential, implementation, policies and support. There is little known about operating manure biorefineries in literature (Awasthi et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>The rationale behind this workwhich is the part of the H2020 project "Transition towards a more carbon and nutrient efficient agriculture in Europe" (2018)(2019)(2020)(2021)(2022) is that first and foremost, there is a necessity to manage and process poultry manure in more efficient and safe manner allowing to close carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus loops in agriculture. The novelty of this work lies primarily in the revision of limitations to selected technologies and methods for handling and processing poultry manure. Also, this work presents the analysis of the potential and realistic risks and threats related to poultry manure, particularly when directly or after biological treatment applied to soil.</p>
        <p>The overall goal of this review was to analyse the current state of management practices for poultry manure in Poland and present future perspectives in terms of technologies allowing closing the nutrient loops for a circular economy and recover nutrients and energy. The scope of the review included: (1) analysis of poultry production and generation of poultry manure with special references to quantities, properties (e.g. fertilizing properties), seasonality, etc., (2) legal framework and policies for management of poultry manure, (3) potential and realistic threats related to applications of poultry manure, (4) overview of current practices and methods for managing poultry manure including advantages and limitations, (5) analysis of promising technologies for converting poultry manure into added value products and energy.</p>
        <p>According to the EUROSTAT data production of poultry in the EU-28 in 2018 was as follows: Poland -16.8%, UK -12.9%, France -11.4%, Spain -10.7%, Germany -10.4%, Italy -8.5%, Hungary -3.5% and the remaining constituted in total -26.0%. Over the years Poland has been a leader in poultry production in Europe and according to the recent statistics the production is on the increase (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>In 2017, the total amount of poultry production was estimated at 192.1 mln birdsthe amount of chickens was estimated at 176.7 mln (including 53 mln laying hens) (Statistics Poland, 2019). In the first quarter of 2018 the amount of 619.92 thousand tons of poultry meat was produced. It is about 20 thousand tons more than currently of the year in 2017 (Eurostat, 2018). This makes Poland a particularly interesting case study in terms of dynamic poultry production and consumption, increasing generation and efficient management of poultry manure.</p>
        <p>The poultry market in Poland is divided into two segments, i.e. gallinaceous birds (hens and turkeys) and water birds (geese and ducks). There are two main directions of poultry production, i.e. for eggs and meat. Poultry meat is produced from chicken, duck, turkey and geese broilers. Hens and turkeys are produced in intensive breeding, other poultry species are produced in extensive and semi-intensive breeding systems.</p>
        <p>In Poland 86.8% of poultry is raised in cage breeding system, 9.6% in bedding system, 3.2% in free range system and only 0.3% in organic system. As for the European Union, the cage breeding system also predominates (58.7%), whereas more poultry is raised in bedding system (27.5%) and free-range system (9.2%), and organic system (4.6%) (National Chamber of Poultry Producers and Feed, 2019).</p>
        <p>Poultry farms of different size, structure and breeding systems are located all over the country and include free range farms (less than birds), non industrial scale farms (from 350 to 10 thousand birds), small industrial-scale farms (from 10 thousand to 15 thousand birds), medium industrial-scale farms (from 15 thousand to 52.5 thousand birds) and large industrial-scale farms (52.5 thousand birds and more). According to statistical data for laying hens, it is estimated that there are about non industrial-scale farms, 84 small industrial-scale farms, 311 medium industrial-scale farms and 157 large industrial-scale farms in Poland (General Veterinary Inspectorate, 2019). Fig. 2 presents the distribution of poultry farms in Poland in 2018 (General Veterinary Inspectorate, 2019).</p>
        <p>It is estimated that the total amount of manure produced annually is 4,494,639 Mg from all types of poultry farming in Poland, (Ta� nczuk et al., 2019a,b;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019b). Consequently, in view to the distribution of poultry farms in different voivodships in Poland, the highest quantities of poultry manure were reported for Mazowieckie and Wielkopolskie voivodships. According to the most recent data from 2018 the quantities of poultry manure generated in different systems, i. e. cage breeding, bedding system (also referred to as litter breeding system) and free-range system are presented in Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>It is reported that the annual generation of manure from the cage breeding system in Poland is at 1,830,908 Mg. Most of the manure is generated in such voivodships as Wielkopolskie (673,472 Mg/a), Mazowieckie (379,381 Mg/a) and Małopolskie (84,596 Mg/a). As for the litter breeding system, the annual production of manure is estimated at 272,570 Mg/a. The highest quantities are generated in Mazowieckie (38,905 Mg/a), Podlaskie (31,868 Mg/a) and � Sląskie (31,633 Mg/a) voivodships. The annual generation of manure from the free-range breeding system is estimated at 61,538 Mg/a with the highest quantities in Mazowieckie (514,872 Mg/a), Wielkopolskie (324,019 Mg/a) and Podlaskie (212,007 Mg/a) voivodships. These legal documents lay down the rules for handling and managing poultry manure defined as any excrements and/or urine of farmed animals other than farmed fish, with our without litter. Poultry manure is classified into the category 2 of animal by-products and could be:</p>
        <p>-used to produce organic fertilizers or soil improvements and placing onto the Polish market in compliance to the Article 32 (Regulation of the European Parliament and Council (CE) No 1069/2009), -composted or converted into biogas, -applied to soil without prior pretreatment, -used as a fuel for combustion with or without prior pretreatment, -applied to produce other by-products indicated in the Article 33, 34 and 36, and placing on the market in compliance with these articles.</p>
        <p>It is worth to emphasize that production of fertilizers or soil improvers predominates. In this case, there is a number of legal requirements to fulfil. Table 1 presents the legislation to be followed when producing natural fertilizers (Kukier et al., 2016). On a national level, any natural fertilizer which was produced should obtain an opinion regarding the fulfillment of requirements on pollution and the quality of the obtained natural fertilizer, e.g. from poultry manure. In Poland there is a number of certified institutions which test and evaluate fertilizers (e.g. Whereas tests assessing the impact on human and animal health, the environment, through tests sanitary and biological tests. These tests are carried out by the following institutions: the National Veterinary Institute -National Research Institute in Puławy (issues opinions on the lack on harmful effects on animals and veterinary status), the Institute of Rural Medicine Witolda Chod� zki in Lublin (issues opinions about lack on harmful effects on human health), the Institute of Environmental Protection in Warsaw (issues opinions about lack on harmful effects on environment) (Kukier et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Poultry manure is one of the major animal by-products generated in production of poultry in Poland. Legal definition of manure as an animal by-product states that this means any excrements and/or urine of farmed animals other than farmed fish, with our without litter (Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009). Table 2 shows the quantities of poultry manure produced by different breeds and groups.</p>
        <p>In 2017 the quantity of chicken manure produced in Poland was estimated at 2121750 Mg per year (Polish)Yearbook Statistics Office, 2018) (Statistical Yearbook of Agriculture, 2018).</p>
        <p>Poultry manure contains wide range of various nutrients and elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, zinc, calcium, cobalt, iron, selenium, molybdenum, manganese and boron. In comparison to other types of animal manure, poultry manure demonstrates higher contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium (Table 3).</p>
        <p>The contents of these constituents may differ depending on several factors such as a breeding system, seasonality, a breed type and a production group. For example, chicken manure contains about 68-73% of water, 1.24-2.31% of nitrogen, 0.48-0.68% of phosphorus, 0.36-0.59% of potassium. Nitrogen is present in the form uric acid (40-70%), urea (4-12%), ammonium (4-20%) and nitrogen of feed protein (10-40%). Trace amounts of nitrogen can be also present in the form of, e.g., creatine (Augusty� nska-Prejsnar et al., 2018). For example, chicken broiler production in a bedding system can generate 2 Mg per 1000 birds of manure containing 2.8% of nitrogen, 3.0% of phosphorous and 1.5% of potassium. As for laying hens in a bedding system the quantity of manure can reach up to 30 Mg per yearthe content of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium is about 2.4, 2.5 and 1.1%, respectively (Myszograj and Puchalska, 2012).</p>
        <p>Production of poultry in various farming systems in Poland poses many threats to natural environment and human health. They include: emission of noise, emission of pollutants into the atmosphere, waste generation, contamination of wastewater and microbial contamination.</p>
        <p>Noise emission is related to operations and installations in the poultry farming building (e.g. roof and peak fans). The main source of substances emitted to the environment from the installations are animals kept in livestock buildings. As a result, the following compounds are emitted in the poultry houses: ammonia (NH 3 ), methane (CH 3 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), dust -including suspended particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5, substances created as a result of burning gas for heating purposes: sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO) and dust. Poultry farms can also generate dimethylamine, carbon dioxide, as well as ketones, aldehydes, organic acids and other odor compounds (Myszograj and Puchalska, 2012). The most environmentally harmful gas produced at poultry farms is ammonia. From the total amount of nitrogen excreted by birds -from 13 to 20% for broilers and from 2 to 20% for laying hens, it is released from the manure into the air in the form of ammonia: direct emissions from hen houses, storage areas for used litter and poultry manure, arable fields in the case of using a poultry manure as a fertilizer. Ammonia released from the litter in the hen house, adversely affects birds, but also negatively impacts on workers.</p>
        <p>Intensive production of poultry in Poland faces many challenges, including those relating to handling and managing poultry manure.</p>
        <p>Poultry manure can pose a potential threat to human health and have a negative impact on natural environment, in particular the quality of water and soil (Myszograj and Puchalska, 2012).</p>
        <p>Storage of poultry manure can generate odors and gaseous emissions such as ammonia (Table 4) and methane. It is estimated that the total amount of nitrogen released from chicken manure in the form of ammonia is 2-20% from laying hens and 13-20% from broilers. As for methane emission from 1000 birds, it is generally estimated at 80 kg per year (Mielcarek, 2012). In 2015, the European Union agricultural sector emitted 3751 kilotons of NH 3 and was responsible for 94% of total ammonia emissions in EU (Eurostat, 2018).</p>
        <p>What is more, poultry manure can be contaminated with trace</p>
        <p>Emission of ammonia on the farms resulted from poultry manure storage.</p>
        <p>Emission from 1000 birds in kg per year Type of waste Laying hens elements which is directly attributed to feeding and breeding procedures. Usually, zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are used as animal feed supplements to increase the feed efficiency and decrease morbidity. Wieremiej (2017) reported that poultry manure can contain 3900 mg/kg of Fe, 427 mg/kg Zn, 13 mg/kg Ni, while cattle manure contains about 150 mg/kg of Zn. Another issues of poultry manure application is connected with migration of pathogens and air pollution, especially odors and greenhouse gases emission (Wieremiej, 2017). Poultry production can be the source of specific microbial contamination. The characteristic microclimate of the poultry house environment is associated with high air humidity, high temperature, reduced air exchange volume and solid elements such as: drinking bowls, feeders, feeders, perches, nests, litter, feed and animals. Generally, poultry source is the most important source of bioaerosols (Stuper-Szablewska et al., 2018). In an industrial poultry farm, potential threats to human health include: Chlamydia spp., virus H5N1, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus anthracis; Listeria monocytogynes; Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus (A. niger, A. nidulans, A. ochraceus), Penicillium notatum, Penicilliums sp., Cladosporium sp., Alternaria sp., Candida albicans. The occurrence of Salmonella at poultry farms is strictly monitored by the General Veterinary Inspectorate in Poland. The possible route of transfer of bacteria with poultry meat is also estimated. Each case of Salmonella detection in meat is send to Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. The Staphylococcus content is an indicator of bacterial air pollution. The threat is the possibility of transporting pathogens in the air. The emission from the source with the windbreak can be at least 500m, and the concentration of Staphylococci at this distance may obtain even 4000 CFU/m 3 (National Chamber of Poultry Producers and Feed, 2019). The source of contaminations can be also surrounding soil. Trawi� nska et al. (2016) in the conducted research near the reproductive chicken farm showed the presence of E. coli and Proteus spp.</p>
        <p>According to the report published Supreme Audit Office (2014) four main risks were identified, i.e.: odors, contamination of water, overfertilization of soil, and chemical and microbiological contamination of food (e.g. residues of antibiotics and growth hormones) (Western Center of Social and Economic Research, 2018).</p>
        <p>Poultry manure is rich in nutrients, and thus could be directly applied to soil as a soil improver or after being processed, e.g. through composting as a fertilizer or a compost. However, poultry manure can also contain various contaminants which are potential risks to soil and living organisms. Table 5 presents the list of key contaminants which were detected in poultry manure.</p>
        <p>Antibiotics used in poultry treatment can have direct implications to poultry manure. Until 1969, antibiotics were used intensively in Poland. This resulted in antibiotic resistance in poultry. Since then, the use of excessive amounts of antibiotics that have stimulated animal growth has been gradually withdrawn. Farmers could only use antibiotics that were supposed to reduce pathogen infections and other medications could be used only after consulting a veterinarian. In 1997-1999, medicine such as avoparcin, zinc bacitracin, spiromycin, virginiamycin, and tyrosine phosphate were withdrawn from use in the European Union. In 2006-2007, however, all antibiotics were banned except therapeutic drugs, only the possibility of application coccidiostats. Despite the prohibition introduced in 2007 on the use of antibiotics that stimulate growth, the effects of excessive use are still being observed. This is manifested by pathogens that have strong defense mechanisms transmitted through inheritance. Medicine resistance became a problem that has still not been effectively eliminated. New antibiotics are effective only for a short period. Then, pathogens quickly specialize in new defense mechanisms (Zalewska et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>In the literature, we can find data on the content of antibiotics in animal organisms and the amount of their excretion along with faeces.</p>
        <p>The key contaminations detected in poultry manure. Table 6 shows the content of antibiotics in the bodies of animals that are intended for food purposes, data from 29 European Union countries (Quaik et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Although residues of veterinary medicines can be found in poultry manure at concentrations which do not have a greater direct effect on human health in the food chain (soil, plants, animal, man), the presence of these residues has significant consequences for thriving of the soil microflora. The most pressing problem is growing drug resistance, including antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in the environment. In addition, the microbial resistance is enhanced due to metals/metalloids presence (Kyakuwaire et al., 2019). It is estimated that up to 75 percent of the antimicrobials used in poultry are excreted (Lalou� ckov� a et al., 2019). The main poultry parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp. can simply spread from manure to water resources and can persist in the environment causing danger to animals and humans (Bowman et al., 2000). Research on the influence of steroids on endocrine disruption confirms fish reproductive disorders nearby the runoff from poultry manure amended fields (Gerber et al., 2007). In the group of contaminants present in poultry manure, insecticides can also be found. They are used in the control of Dermanyssus gallinae (also known as the red mite) which is an ectoparasite of poultry and has been implicated as a vector of several major pathogenic diseases. Thus, fipronil (Table 7) is in usage in controlling insects (Ong et al., 2017), although its use in poultry production in Poland is prohibited.</p>
        <p>Not all countries comply with the law regarding the use of medicines in animal husbandry. Legal gaps that allow medicine use are still being exploited. Also, banning the use of medicine completely will not solve the problem right away. Medicine-resistant pathogens, new antibiotics, accumulation of drugs in soil, water is a challenge to study over the next years.</p>
        <p>Apart from antibiotics, pesticides can have also direct implications on the application of poultry manure. One of the pesticides, more specifically an insecticide, that has a very good insecticidal effect is Fipronil. It was introduced to the market in 1993. Especially effective against parasites that occur on the skin and feathers of poultry.</p>
        <p>However, similarly to antibiotics, this pesticide accumulates in the body, eggs, animal droppings, and sewage. Thus, posing a threat to soil and water when poultry manure is applied to soil as a fertilizer. Fipronil has been banned in the European Union since 2013 due to its harmfulness to humans and animals. The lethal dose for humans is LD 50 ¼ 92 mg/kg, for rodents 24 mg/kg and for insects including flies and pollinating insects 0.13 mg/kg. While, the limits for insecticide (the metabolite of fipronil -de-sulfinyl fipronil) in the EU are, for humans (daily intake) 0.0002 mg/kg, while in products such as eggs 0.005 mg/ kg (i.e. 5 ppb per egg). Despite the legal regulations, a big problem with this pesticide is in the USA and China, where animal production is much higher than in the EU.</p>
        <p>For example, in China, 2.875 billion tonnes of organic waste is generated annually from poultry production alone (Hu et al., 2019;Stafford et al., 2018). Different doses of pesticide and their accumulation in selected poultry tissues depend on the time of exposure to the pesticide, dose, frequency of administration, type of animal. Table 7 gives examples of pesticide content in poultry tissues (Stafford et al., 2018). The analysis was performed 28.975 days after the start of dosing.</p>
        <p>Fipronil is harmful to living organisms due to irreversible contamination with this pesticide. There is little information regarding the decomposition time in the body of this insecticide and how it affects the innate traits in animals.</p>
        <p>The most common practices for management of poultry manure in Poland include the applications of poultry manure for soil (land spreading of unprocessed poultry manure, production of fertilizers and soil improves of different composition and in various forms, e.g. unprocessed poultry manure, granular forms, pellets and composts) and for production of biogas through anaerobic digestion. Examples of soil applications include using poultry manure as an unprocessed organic fertilizer, a feedstock for composting with other agricultural residues to produce compost, as feedstock to be processed into a granulated or pelletised fertilizers and other fertilizers mixed with mulch and minerals (e.g. dolomite, lignite, peat). Ash from combustion of chicken manure, as an addition to fertilizers (Augusty� nska-Prejsnar et al., 2018;Kope� c et al., 2014;Staro� n et al., 2014). Poultry manure can be used as a fuel (e. g. in a form of pellets) for combustion to recover energy as well as a main substrate for biogas production. Other applications include mushroom production where poultry manure can serve as a substrate/growing media for mushrooms (Łobos and Szewczyk, 2013). Also, recently there is a growing interest in converting poultry manure into biochar that demonstrates some potential for soil and environmental applications (Słodeczek et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Soil applications are the most common practices for managing poultry manure. One of the least energy consuming methods of poultry manure disposal is land spreading. Poultry manure can be used as a soil amendment and fertilizer due to high content of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and trace elements which can improve the physical and biological fertility of soil. Natural (manure) fertilization is the source of essential nutrients for plants. The processes of mineralization of organic compounds contained in natural fertilizers cause beneficial effects on plants with a long growing season, increase the possibility of soil retention and slow decomposition of phosphorus and potassium, and as a source of humus improve the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil and enrich its microflora. The standard practice before poultry manure soil application is to determine the fertilization dose based on the nitrogen content in soil and in manure. In accordance with legal regulations in Poland and the European Union, the nitrogen dose applied cannot exceed 170 kg per ha per year (Council Directive 91/676/EEC, 1991). It is estimated that yearly generated poultry manure production enables fertilization of 2% agricultural land in Poland (Wieremiej, 2017). The perfect content of C:N:P in fertilizer for biological purposes shall be 100-10-1. Thus, the utilization of poultry manure as a perfect soil fertilizer may require an additional source of carbon (C) to avoid loss of N and P through leaching. This type of fertilizer consists usually 1-14% of C, making the C:N ratio 6-7 (Agbede et al., 2008). The long-standing and repeated poultry manure soil application can result in phosphate and nitrate contamination of surface waters and trace elements accumulation or result in phytotoxic effects on succeeding crops (Agbede et al., 2008;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019a,b;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019b). When using natural fertilization, it should be remembered that mineral components potentially available to plants are released gradually over 2-3 years, which means that natural fertilization cannot be applied to a given soil every year. In Poland, and in central Europe natural fertilizers are used in the most optimal four-year cycle which in a way limits the constant possibility of using poultry manure for agricultural purposes. Moreover, improper application of poultry manure can result in soil nutrient imbalance. Thus, the soil nutrients testing is the primary issue concerning the poultry manure application (Wieremiej, 2017).</p>
        <p>Different doses of the selected pesticide and its accumulation in the selected poultry tissues.</p>
        <p>Egg yolk Peritoneal Fat Skin (10 ppm) -prior to feeding, every 24 h, for 28 days 30,000 56,000 17,000</p>
        <p>(2 ppm) -prior to feeding, every 24 h, for 28 days 7020 12,000 3900 (0.5 ppm) -prior to feeding, every 24 h, for 28 days 180 290 100</p>
        <p>Although the most common ways of managing poultry manure is to use it for nutrient recovery and application to soil, there are other examples of technologies that would allow conversion of poultry manure into added value products. There is a strong interest in combining different technologies for efficient recovery of nutrients and energy from poultry manure. For example, a patented technology "Transforming Poultry Production" developed by BHLS company allows production of heat and energy through combustion of poultry manure uses as a fuel on a fluidized bed. This technology can be applied on a poultry farm where poultry manure is transported to a biologically safe storage and then conveyed to a fluidized bed for combustion. The remaining ashwhich is rich in phosphorus and potassiumcan be used for nutrient recovery and transformation. This complex approach has a number of advantages. Primarily, poultry manure is managed on site and used as a fuel to generate heat and electricity that can be utilized for maintenance of poultry houses. This results in reduction of costs of transportation and increase in biological safety (BHLS, 2015).</p>
        <p>The literature provides a number of examples demonstrating the methods and technologies for converting of poultry manure in order to recover nutrients and/or energy. They include composting, anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, drying and other. Table 8 gives an overview of various methods used to process poultry manure with corresponding challenges.</p>
        <p>It has to be pointed out that the one of the most common challenge for poultry manure processing is dealing with gaseous emissions. This is particularly the case with composting which leads to nitrogen loss through ammonia emission which can range from 13 to 70% (Hao and Benke, 2008;Shin et al., 2019). It was estimated that within nitrification-denitrification of poultry manure the emission of N 2 O ranges from 0.1 to 0.8%, CO 2 ranges from 52 to 80% and CH 4 ranges from 0.04 to 0.34% (Melse et al., 2008;Hou et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Although several technologies are already available for managing poultry manure, there are more promising solutions that are currently being developed in some of the Polish research institutions. Those solutions are based on a complex approach to manage poultry manure on site but also aim at improving the efficiency of the existing technologies and to develop new/improved products from poultry manure. Table 9 presents some of the examples of recent research projects conducted in Poland.</p>
        <p>One of the promising methods for managing poultry manure for energy recovery is production of biogas through anaerobic digestion. The high content of biodegradable organic matter and high buffer capacities of chicken manure is a very interesting substrate for anaerobic digestion (AD). According to literature, chicken manure is characterized by the content of dry organic matter from 63 to 80% total solids (TS), production of biogas: 250-450 m 3 /Mg VS and 60% (volume) of methane content in biogas (Sadecka et al., 2016). Nonetheless, separate AD of this waste may be ended failure due to low carbon to nitrogen ratio in the feedstock (oscillated around 5-10) as well the ammonia accumulation during the process, which is results anaerobic decomposition of uric acid and undigested proteins, namely two main forms of nitrogen in chicken manure (Duan et al., 2018;Yuan et al., 2016;Abouelenien et al., 2010). Ammonium ions and free ammonia are main by-products from degradation of nitrogenous matter, both forms may inhibition of methanogenic activity on following ways: 1) cause a potassium imbalance and/or proton deficiency; 2) inhibition of a specific enzyme reaction; 3) alter the intracellular pH, 4) increase of maintenance energy requirement (Chen et al., 2008). Additionally, high content of hydrogen sulfide in biogas decrease the utility of the AD and forces treatment of biogas before further use for example in co-generation unit (Ta� nczuk et al., 2019a,b;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019b).</p>
        <p>For these reasons, in recent years, researches are focused on the enhancement of effectiveness of the process. From the available intensification options for anaerobic digestion of chicken manure, two seem particularly interesting, namely co-digestion (AcD) with other organic wastes and pre-treatment of the feedstock before AD. Generally, additions of another organic waste to the anaerobic digester causes: a) increase degradation degree of treated substances and improved biogas and methane yields, b) support in establishing the required moisture content of the digester feed (dilution with water or wastewater is one the main strategy to eliminate the negative impact ammonia on AD), c) improve nutrient balance and adjustment of C/N ratio in feedstock, d) increase load of biodegradable fraction as well as content of macro-and micronutrients, e) higher dilution of toxic compounds. Due to this strategy opens up new possibilities for disposal of organic wasteespecially those wastes, which would be difficult to digestion separately (e.g. pig/cow waste slurry) (Mata-Alvarez et al., 2014;Grosser, 2017). The suitable co-substrates for poultry manure are C-rich waste such as: other types of manure like cattle manure (Callaghan et al., 2002), lignocellulosic residues (Neshat et al., 2017), agricultural wastes (Abouelenien et al., 2014) or organic fraction of municipal waste (Matheri et al., 2017), straw (Li et al., 2014), leaves and weeds, hay, haulm tomatoes, haulm cucumbers, grass, corn silage (Sadecka et al., 2016). Agro-industrial waste are the most used as co-substrate. However, due to their seasonality, new groups of wastes are still being sought that could be processed together with manure. Table 10 summarizes some results of poultry manure co-digestion with different wastes research results.</p>
        <p>The effect of introducing external additives on the anaerobic digestion of chicken manure was also studied. For example, Ma et al. (2018) found that compared to the control sample, addition of thermally modified bentonite at 300 � C into reactor increased cumulative methane production up to 41%. Mentioned addition had also positive impact on the buffering capacity of fermentation broth (lower fluctuation of pH than for the control) concentration of soluble salts (lower than for controlit should be kept at a moderate level, because this strategy prevents inactivation of methanogenic archaea as well as inhibition of the transport of metabolite and nutrients) as well as total content of ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and free ammonia (the TAN and FA concentration reduction was improved by 10% and 25%, respectively). Likewise, Pan et al. (2019) observed that the addition of biochar improve the buffering capacity of the anaerobic digestion system as well as reduce the content of TAN, FA and soluble salt. They also found that about 69% of the methane yield was increased for reactor treating chicken manure owning to biochar addition. In turn, Kougias et al. (2013) demonstrated that addition of 10 g/l natural zeolite enhanced the biogas production. In comparison with the control reactor (without zeolite addition) about 109.75% increased methane production was noted. Due to the fact, that the high concentration of ammonia is most often indicated as an agent inhibiting the anaerobic digestion, methods to removal of mentioned compound from feedstock and/or anaerobic digester have been also the subject of studies. Described in literature, the approaches to mitigate accumulation of ammonia into anaerobic digester include following solutions: 1) stripping of the anaerobically digested effluent (Abouelenien et al., 2010;Gu� stin et al., 2010), 2) trace elements supplementation (for example 0.2 g/m 3 of selenium addition stimulated methane production even at high content of hydrogen sulfide and TAN as well as moderate organic loading rate which was possible to occurred through syntrophic acetate oxidation) (Molaey et al., 2018), 3) struvite precipitation, 4) ion exchange, 5) membrane separation (Wang et al., 2018), 6) dilution of the feedstock (typical content 20-25% TS) to 0.5-3.0% total solids (Duan et al., 2018;Kelleher et al., 2002).</p>
        <p>However, in Poland raw poultry manure as a main feedstock is used very rarely. There is only one case of a poultry farm equipped with biogas installation in Poland. This installation of power rating of 25-30 kW on the farm located in near Pszczyna city. This installation is fed The addition of zeolite and coconut fibers effectively reduced ammonia emissions during composting.</p>

        <p>with: chicken droppings (laying hens): (690 tons/year), pig manure (320 ton/year), maize and grass silage (365 ton/year). In turn, in larger installations with the capacity of up to 1 MW, poultry waste are codigested with agro industrial wastes (Ta� nczuk et al., 2019a,b;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019b;BioEnergy, 2015).</p>
        <p>In 2018, near Ballymena in Country Antrim at Tully Quarry in North Ireland, the first installation poultry manure anaerobic digestion was operating. Feedstock before digestion are pre-treatment using technology NiX® (Nitrogen Extraction). The installation may be fed up to 40,000 tonnes of poultry manure per year and may delivered 3 MW of electrical energy. The anaerobic decomposition is a two stage process and it is conducted in four digesters. The whole process takes around 45 days (Martin, 2018;McCullough, 2018).</p>
        <p>Poultry manure can be also processed through thermal treatment (Kelleher et al., 2002) such as combustion or pyrolysis to recover energy and produce added value products. Poultry manure as a substrate has a potential for energy production in e.g. biomass fed power generation Chicken manure can be a filler in cement mortar.</p>
        <p>Due to the low pH of chicken manure 3-4, it should be used at a dose of no more than 25%, because a higher content negatively affects cement binding. Sobczak (2008) 2 Substrate used in growing media for mushrooms</p>

        <p>The challenge is to produce a substrate that will be economically viable and have the desired product characteristics.</p>
        <p>Lobos and Szewczyk (2013) plants (Billen et al. 2015(Billen et al. , 2017;;Junga et al., 2017). Also, the ash generated from combustion is a source of valuable constituents such as phosphorous and potassium (Luyckx et al., 2019;Kaikake et al., 2009), as a feed additive for chickens (Blake and Hess, 2014) or as a soil improver or a fertilizer (Billen et al., 2015;Komiyama et al., 2013). Thermal processes are often applied to poultry manure to produce liquid (Midgett et al., 2012;Agblevor et al., 2010) or gaseous (Ta� nczuk et al., 2019a,b;Ta� nczuk et al., 2019b) fuels.</p>
        <p>Recent studies and reports show that there is also an increasing interest in converting poultry manure through pyrolysis into biochars which could demonstrate a wide range of properties, and thus various applications (Qi et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018;Novak et al., 2009;Bavariani et al., 2019;Song and Guo, 2012;Srinivasan et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Specific properties of biochars produced from a different substrates indicate that those products of pyrolysis can be applied to improve soil properties (Zhao et al., 2018;Ferreira et al., 2018;Czekała et al., 2019), to remove organic and inorganic contaminants from various media (Dai et al., 2019;Ahmed and Hameed, 2018;El-Banna et al., 2018;Regkouzas and Diamadopoulos, 2019), to mitigate ammonia emissions and nitrogen loss during composting (Wang et al., 2018;Sanchez-Monedero et al., 2018;Janczak et al., 2017;Mali� nska et al., 2014;Ahmed and Hameed, 2018). The potential effects of biochars result from the properties of a substrate and process parameters such as pyrolysis temperature (Li and Chen, 2018;Bavariani et al., 2019;Wystalska et al., 2018;De Bhowmick et al., 2018;Bavariani et al. 2019Bavariani et al. , 2019;;Vaughn et al., 2018, Song andGuo, 2012). With the change in temperature of the pyrolysis process also the properties of biochars change. These properties include pH, elementary composition, surface area, porosity, type and quantity of functional surface groups or stability Li et al., (2017), Hung et al. (2017), Hasnan et al. (2018), Zhao et al., (2018), Song andGuo, 2012, Li andChen (2018), Giudicianni (2017), Many� a et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Recent studies report that poultry manure can be converted to biochars in the range of temperatures of 200-700 � C (Qi et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018;Novak et al., 2009;Bavariani et al., 2019;Song and Guo, 2012;Srinivasan et al., 2015) resulting in various properties of biochars (see Table 11).</p>
        <p>The literature provides a number of studies on potential applications of poultry derived biochars which can be used as amendments for composting (Khan et al., 2016), materials for immobilization of selected heavy metals (Uchimiya et al., 2012), sorbents (Uchimiya et al., 2010;Li et al., 2018;Qi et al., 2017), soil improvers (Srinivasan et al., 2015;Bavariani et al., 2019;Novak et al., 2009) or additives for carbon sequestration (Srinivasan et al., 2015). However, the literature does not provide sufficient analysis of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous cycles during the process of pyrolysis, and thus nutrient transformation and loss. Any literature on scaling up pyrolysis of poultry manure has not been reported. Most of the work has been done on laboratory or pilot scale.</p>
        <p>Poland is one of the leading poultry producers in Europe and as such has to face many challenges with managing the quantities of poultry manure generated at Polish poultry farms. The number of poultry farms in Poland has been increasing which resulted in even higher quantities of poultry manure that need to be properly managed. It has to be pointed out that one of the main challenges of poultry management is handling and managing poultry manure in small and medium-sized industrial farms located in non rural areas in Poland. Excessive quantities of poultry manure require transportation, storage and further handling and/or processing. Uncontrolled management of poultry manure can cause emission of methane, carbon dioxide and ammonia into the atmosphere. Poultry manure applied to soil in excess and in uncontrolled manner can pose a serious threat to soil and water environment.</p>
        <p>Poultry manure is rich in nitrogen but also contains significant quantities of phosphorous and potassium, and thus is used to produce fertilizers and soil improvers which are available in granular forms, pellets or as composts. In rural areas, still the most common practices of management of poultry manure are related to soil applications. However, since there is limited area for safe land spreading of unprocessed poultry manure, therefore it has to be handled using different methods.</p>
        <p>Apart from predominating soil applications, poultry manure is used to recover energy. Present solutions are based on combustion of poultry manure in thermal installations to produce heat and electricity. It has to be emphasized that currently in Poland there is a growing interest in converting poultry manure into biogas through anaerobic mono and codigestion. However, there is a number of challengers related to this technology which are now investigated by researchers in many research institutions.</p>
        <p>Ongoing research projects conducted in Polish research institutions have the ambition to provide more centralized solutions for nutrient and energy recovery from poultry manure. Those solutions attempt to combine existing technologies (composting, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion) and develop a biorefinery platform for poultry manure. Closing carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous loops in management of poultry would require dealing with e.g. nitrogen loss and ammonia emission during composting, ammonia inhibition during anaerobic digestion and nutrient transformation and losses in pyrolysis. Nowadays, research has been driven by the concept of poultry biorefineryan approach to manage and process poultry manure on site for energy and nutrient recovery and production of added value products. However, more work is needed to verify and upscale this concept in various economic conditions, farm typologies and legal and environmental requirements.</p>
        <p>With reference to the outcome of this study we can conclude that:</p>
