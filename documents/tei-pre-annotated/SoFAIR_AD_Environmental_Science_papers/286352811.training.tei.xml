        <p>About 80% of the annual rainfall in India falls during the monsoon season (Parthasarathy et al, 1994) and the Indian population depends on this water for agriculture, hydration, and industry. Any variability in timing, duration and intensity of the monsoon rains have a significant impact on the lives of the people in India. In recent years, several parts of India have experienced devastating flooding events. For example, on 26 July 2005, Mumbai experienced the worst flooding in recorded history when the city received 942 mm of rainfall on a single day (Prasad and Singh, 2005). Similarly, on 17 June 2013, the state of Uttarakhand over their catchment areas. After the first episode of heavy rain, most of the reservoirs in the state were near their Full Reservoir Level (FRL) and most of the soil in the region became saturated. Thus, when the second episode started several days later, the authorities had to open the shutters of almost all the major dams in Kerala. A combination of these torrential rains and opening of the dam shutters resulted in severe flooding in 13 out of the 14 districts in Kerala (Mishra et al, 2018b;CWC, 2018). Given the volume of precipitation that fell during this period, could the dams possibly have prevented the floods that followed? Sudheer et al (2019) used a hydrological model to explore the role of dams in the Periyar river basin in the 2018 floods. They suggested that emptying the reservoirs in advance would not have avoided the flood as a large bulk of the surface runoff was caused by intermediate catchments which do not have controlled reservoir operations. They found that in the Periyar river basin, improved reservoir management would have only attenuated the flood by 16-21%. Furthermore, they highlighted that the probability of getting extreme rainfall events in the Periyar river basin in August is only 0.6% and hence a reliable extreme rainfall event forecast coupled with a reservoir inflow forecast is needed to plan mitigation. Mishra et al (2018b) found that the extreme precipitation and subsequent flooding of the 2018 event was unprecedented over a 66-year record. They suggested that while mean monsoon precipitation has decreased and mean temperature has increased over that period, one-and two-day extreme precipitation and extreme runoff conditions in in August 2018 exceeded the 95th percentile of the long-term mean from 1951-2017.About 80% of the annual rainfall in India falls during the monsoon season (Parthasarathy et al, 1994) and the Indian population depends on this water for agriculture, hydration, and industry.

        <p>According to the recent Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) report (Solomon et al, 2007), wet extremes are projected to become more severe in many areas where mean precipitation is projected to increase, as is flooding in the Asian monsoon region and other tropical areas. Several studies suggest that rainfall extreme events will increase in India under global warming (Goswami et al, 2006a;Rajeevan et al, 2008;Guhathakurta et al, 2011a;Menon et al, 2013;Roxy et al, 2017). Most extreme events over central India are associated with monsoon depressions (Dhar and Nandargi, 1995), hence intensification of extreme rainfall events could be related to the change in dynamics of the monsoon depressions (Pfahl et al, 2017). However, due to the coarse resolution of global climate models, it is unknown if the extreme rainfall events in these models are caused by monsoon depressions (Turner and Annamalai, 2012). Several observational studies, however suggest that the frequency of monsoon depressions has decreased and the frequency of low-pressure sys-cussed in Section 4.According to the recent Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) report (Solomon et al, 2007), wet extremes are projected to become more severe in many areas where mean precipitation is projected to increase, as is flooding in the Asian monsoon region and other tropical areas.

        <p>For the initial and lateral boundary conditions in our regional model setup, we use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-I; Dee et al, 2011). The surface fields, as well as soil temperature and moisture at selected depths are used only for initial conditions; atmospheric variables, which include wind, temperature and moisture defined over pressure levels are used to construct both initial and boundary conditions. All fields are available at sixhourly intervals with a horizontal resolution of T255 (∼ 78 km at the equator), with the three-dimensional fields further distributed over 37 vertical levels spanning from the surface to 1 hPa. Data are assimilated into the forecasting system from a variety of sources, including satellites, ships, buoys, radiosondes, aircraft, and scatterometers. Fields deriving purely from the model (i.e. not analysed), for example precipitation and cloud cover, are not used in this study.For the initial and lateral boundary conditions in our regional model setup, we use the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-I; Dee et al, 2011).

        <p>We need a relatively high-resolution observational rainfall dataset with which to compare our model output. Arguably the most suitable such dataset is the NCM-RWF merged product (Mitra et al, 2009(Mitra et al, , 2013)), which combines automatic gauge data from the India Meteorological Department with satellite data from the TRMM multisatellite precipitation analysis (Huffman et al, 2007). This provides a rainfall dataset covering India and surrounding oceans at daily frequency and 0.25 • horizontal resolution.We need a relatively high-resolution observational rainfall dataset with which to compare our model output.

        <p>For this study, we use the 32 freely-accessible CMIP5 models (Taylor et al, 2012) for which monthly pressure level data were available. Where possible, the r1p1i1 ensemble member was chosen as the representative of each model, so as not to unfairly weight the results towards any particular model. The exception was EC-EARTH, for which, due to data availability reasons, member r9p1i1 was used. In this study, we use data from three of the CMIP5 experiments: historical, pre-industrial, and RCP8.5. The historical experiments of all models used here are forced with observed natural and anthropogenic contributions, usually from over the period 1850-2005, from which we take a representative period Yang et al, 2011). In our configuration, both overland (steepest descent) and channel routing (differential wave gridded) were activated, with the hydrological model running at a resolution of 125 m (timestep: 10 s) and the land surface model running at 4 km (timestep: 1 hr). The LSM takes as input hourly output from the WRF model, distributing surface precipitation among its four soil layers (set at 7, 28, 100, and 289 cm to match ERA-Interim) and the surface; WRF-Hydro then channels this moisture accordingly at the higher resolution. The high-resolution input files, containing important geospatial information (e.g. slope direction, river channel mask) were created using the WRF-Hydro GIS preprocessing toolkit and the satellite-derived Hy-droSHEDS hydrographic dataset (Lehner et al, 2008;Lehner and Grill, 2013). These modelled rivers and their basins are shown in Fig. 2.For this study, we use the 32 freely-accessible CMIP5 models (Taylor et al, 2012) for which monthly pressure level data were available.

        <p>Because of a lack of relevant reservoir and lake data for the state of Kerala, these features were not implemented in the hydrological model; one major implication of this was that the surface water output from WRF-Hydro was inaccurate (while the natural lakes were correctly represented, the artificial reservoirs were not). Given that some of the reservoirs are substantial (the largest, created by the Idukki dam, is about 60 km 2 ), we chose to run the LSM and WRF-Hydro offline (i.e. coupled to each other but not to WRF) in order to mitigate incorrect feedbacks caused by mislocated surface water.Because of a lack of relevant reservoir and lake data for the state of Kerala, these features were not implemented in the hydrological model; one major implication of this was that the surface water output from WRF-Hydro was inaccurate (while the natural lakes were correctly represented, the artificial reservoirs were not).

        <p>Furthermore, the long spin-up time necessary for the hydrological model meant that a cold start in the summer of 2018 would have been inappropriate. As such, we ran WRF with the control experiment parameters from 1 June 2017 to 1 July 2018 (the start date of all experiments), using the output to force WRF-Hydro so that warm restart files were available for the study period.Furthermore, the long spin-up time necessary for the hydrological model meant that a cold start in the summer of 2018 would have been inappropriate.

        <p>One of the key foci of this study will be to explore how the 2018 floods would have differed in the absence of anthropogenic climate change and how it would differ in a projected future climate. To this end we use a technique commonly referred to as pseudo-global warming (PGW, e.g. Kimura and Kitoh, 2007;Prein et al, 2017;Hunt et al, 2019). Taking an example of modifying 01-08-2018 00Z boundary conditions to reflect RCP8.5 conditions, we describe the methodology below:One of the key foci of this study will be to explore how the 2018 floods would have differed in the absence of anthropogenic climate change and how it would differ in a projected future climate.

        <p>We start our analysis by looking at the primary cause of all floods: precipitation. Fig. 3 shows different aspects of the rainfall occurring during and immediately before the floods, covering the period August 6 to August 18 inclusive. The leftmost panel shows the mean rainfall for this period according to the NCMRWF merged precipitation product (see Sec. 2.2). Rainfall is concentrated mostly along the peaks of the Western Ghats, thus the hydrological stress that triggered the flooding came about from an (approximate) amplification of the mean monsoon pattern rather than through rainfall falling in unusual locations. This pattern is in agreement with the assessment of Mishra and Shah (2018) who investigated IMD rainfall data3 for the period.We start our analysis by looking at the primary cause of all floods: precipitation.

        <p>Second from left in Fig. 3 is the mean rainfall for our WRF control experiment for the same period (06/08-18/08), showing a broad structure very similar to observations for the period shown in the first panel 4 . Again, the rainfall is predominantly onshore, concentrated over Fig. 2: Locations of important hydrological features in the state of Kerala, with state boundaries given in black. Major river catchment boundaries are given in green, with selected rivers labelled accordingly. Plotted river width is a function of Strahler stream order. the orography. At this resolution, though it was suggested by the observational data, we can see that the mean rainfall for this period is heaviest over -or slightly upstream of -the major dams. Upstream of Idamalayar and Parambikulam the mean rate for some areas reached more than 15 mm hr -1 , amounting to an accu-mulation exceeding 4.5 m for period. This is in accor-387 dance with data released by the Central Water Com-388 mission 5 , as is the spatial distribution.Second from left in Fig. 3 is the mean rainfall for our WRF control experiment for the same period (06/08-18/08), showing a broad structure very similar to observations for the period shown in the first panel 4 .

        <p>The moisture flux that impinges upon the Western Ghats is responsible for the vast majority of the monsoon rainfall that falls over Kerala, subject to localised dynamics dependent also on the land-sea contrast (Fletcher et al, 2018). To first order, changes in this moisture flux can be thought of as a sum of contributions from changes to humidity and changes to the wind field, i.e.:The moisture flux that impinges upon the Western Ghats is responsible for the vast majority of the monsoon rainfall that falls over Kerala, subject to localised dynamics dependent also on the land-sea contrast (Fletcher et al, 2018).

        <p>All seven of the important dams (and their eponymous reservoirs) lie on major rivers or significant tributaries thereof. Given the complicated partitioning of river basins over Kerala (Fig. 2), these maps provide a useful overview of their response to heavy rainfall during August 2018 and how that response changes when the rainfall responds to the different climates of the pre-industrial and RCP8.5 perturbation experiments. Fig. 5(b) shows the difference between the mean control discharge and that of the pre-industrial experiment. As the rainfall is generally less in the latter during this period, we see the expected pattern of almost completely reduced streamflow over the domain; the exact reduction varies considerably depending on location (and is indeed an increase in some areas) but averages 16% over the domain. In contrast, Fig. 5(c) shows that streamflow almost universally increases over the domain in the RCP8.5 experiment when compared to the control. In some places, the change is quite drastic: the mean increase over the domain is 33%, the upper quartile is 77%, and the ninetieth percentile is 97%. In other words, one in ten river points in the domain would have experienced twice the discharge were this event to have happened in an RCP8.5 climate. The domain-averaged changes of -16% and 33% for pre-industrial and RCP8.5 are in strong agreement with the domain-averaged rainfall changes of -18% and 36% respectively.All seven of the important dams (and their eponymous reservoirs) lie on major rivers or significant tributaries thereof.

        <p>The story would be incomplete without some focus on the reservoir/dam system that failed in the lead up to the floods. While a complete treatment of that topic is beyond the scope of this work, we will endeavour to give a thorough analysis with the available data. We start by using the largest reservoir in the state, Idukki, as a case study. Fig. 6 shows the modelled inflow and storage for all three experiments, as well as the observed storage from India-WRIS and the nominal capacity of the reservoir. As discussed in Sec. 2.7, to convert modelled inflow to a representative storage we must integrate it over time and include both a sluicing rate and a shape factor. These are reservoir-specific unknowns that we need to fit for using a standard least-squares method. Leveraging part of the long spin up period required by the hydrological model, we calibrated using observational and (control experiment) model data from January to June 2018 inclusive; the low rainfall during the pre-monsoon being particularly useful to establish the correct sluicing rate.The story would be incomplete without some focus on the reservoir/dam system that failed in the lead up to the floods.

Our model is not party to that inforeach case this manifests as a large divergence between 605 modelled and observed storage starting in mid August. all but Kallada, the 2018 observed storage reached its 611 FRL; and in all cases, at some point in July or Au-gust, the storage reaches its highest value since records began in 2001. Two reservoirs, Idamalayar and Malampuzha, exhibit seemingly counter-intuitive behaviour: by the end of August, the largest storage values come from the pre-industrial experiment and the smallest from RCP8.5. Inspection of Fig. 3 reveals that although nearly everywhere in the domain receives more rainfall in the RCP8.5 experiment (compared to the control), both these dams are situated downstream of small regions where the reverse is true, seemingly in part due to the absence of some rainfall-triggering event in mid July. Thus, in these unusual cases, it is possible that future climate may mitigate hydrological stress on these reservoirs. The remaining four have storage patterns that more closely reflect the general results presented earlier in this study: the highest storage values are reached in RCP8.5, followed by pre-industrial, with control at the bottom. Averaged over these four reservoirs, the peak storage in the control experiment is 34% higher than the nominal maximum capacity, rising to 43% in pre-industrial conditions and 54% in RCP8.5 conditions. Including the two anomalous reservoirs, these become 37%, 50% and 44% respectively.The inflow rates from all three experiments are in line with what we expect from Fig. 5: overall the con- 4).

        <p>Finally, we look at the general impact on the 62 dams/reservoirs shown in Fig. 2, whose inflows are grouped by river basin in Fig. 8; for each basin, the inflow is computed as the sum of inflow to all reservoirs therein. Noting that the basins are arranged by latitude, several important contrasts emerge. Firstly, the relative impact of the first LPS (triggering the peaks between Aug 8 and Aug 10) is less among the more southerly basins; likely because as a weaker system, it would have a smaller region of influence, and thus less impact on the bulk monsoon flow. Secondly, the impact of switching to an RCP8.5 climate becomes drastically more significant in basins situated further south. Over the period Aug 14 to Aug 19 inclusive, the three smaller basins towards the north (Kuttiyadi, Bharatapuzha, and Karuvannur) have mean control inflow of 26.2 m 3 s -1 , rising 25% to 32.7 m 3 s -1 in the RCP8.5 experiment. For the middle three basins (Chalakkudy, Periyar, and Muvattupuzha), the mean inflow increases 32% from 563 m 3 s -1 in the control to 745 m 3 s -1 in RCP8.5. For the southernmost three (Meenachal, Pamba, and Kallada), this changes drastically: rising 98% from 152 m 3 s -1 to 302 m 3 s -1 . Revisiting Figs. 3 and4(b), we can see why: this area has the largest fractional increase of rainfall in the RCP8.5 experiment (this can be confirmed directly by looking at a ratio map, which we do not show here). This in turn is at least partially caused by a significant increase in moisture flux and moisture flux convergence over the southernmost part of the peninsula, a pattern that is echoed in CMIP5 projections (Sharmila et al, 2015). This has a profound implication: the southern part of Kerala did not flood in 2018 (Mishra and Shah, 2018), but the results here suggest that it almost certainly would do were such an event to happen again in an end-of-century RCP8.5 climate.Finally, we look at the general impact on the 62 dams/reservoirs shown in Fig. 2, whose inflows are grouped by river basin in Fig. 8; for each basin, the inflow is computed as the sum of inflow to all reservoirs therein.

Because the India Water Resource Information 725 Service (India-WRIS) only make certain data publically 726 available (only storage data, and only for six of the 727 largest reservoirs), we used a simple model to convert 728 modelled inflow into reservoir storage to verify our hy-729 drological model. For four of the six reservoirs, before 730 reaching their full reservoir level (FRL), the Pearson 731 correlation coefficient between the observed and mod-732 elled storage exceeded 0.99 with the remaining two both 733 exceeding 0.9. Furthermore, inflow values for several 734 reservoirs in the days preceding the flood published in 735 a report by the Central Water Commission agree closely 736 with the model output, confirming the efficacy of the 737 hydrological model.During Using a high-resolution setup of WRF-Hydro, we 718 showed that the change in domain mean rainfall pro-719 jected onto approximately equivalent changes in mean 720 river streamflow, though as expected there was sub-721 stantial spatial and temporal variance: for example, the 722 90th percentile streamflow over the domain increased 723 by 97% in the RCP8.5 experiment compared to the 724 control.
