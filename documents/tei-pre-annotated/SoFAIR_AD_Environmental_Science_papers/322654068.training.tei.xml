        <p>Research has found that natural environments within urban areas are associated with benefits for human health and wellbeing. However, most studies have primarily focused on publically accessible green space. Less is known about domestic gardens, which in the UK comprise a high proportion of land cover in urban areas and could form a resource for health promotion.</p>
        <p>This study analysed secondary data from the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey, a representative survey of the English population (n = 7,814).</p>
        <p>We investigated the relationships between garden access and use and: general health; evaluative and eudaimonic wellbeing; meeting physical activity guidelines; and visiting nature in the last week. Statistical models included a range of individual and area-level sociodemographic variables. Compared to no garden access, access to a private garden was associated with better evaluative wellbeing, and people with access to a private space such as a balcony, yard or patio were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines. Respondents who reported both gardening and using a garden to relax also reported better health and wellbeing, more physical activity, and more nature visits than those who did not. These findings indicate that domestic gardens are a potential health resource and are not necessarily substituted for by other natural environments, highlighting the importance of their provision alongside green space in urban policy and planning.</p>
        <p> Green space-health research has concentrated on public, not private, green space.</p>
        <p> Having access to a private garden is associated with higher wellbeing.</p>
        <p> Garden use is associated with wellbeing, physical activity, and visiting nature.</p>
        <p> Gardens need inclusion alongside public green space in urban planning.</p>
        <p>There is growing evidence indicating a positive relationship between urban natural environments and health (Twohig-Bennett &amp; Jones, 2018). Urban natural environments refer to a variety of different types of landcover, including urban 'green space' or land that is within a town or city, is not developed, contains natural vegetation, and is accessible to the public (Taylor &amp; Hochuli, 2014). It can also include private and domestic gardens (Dennis &amp; James, 2017) and quasi-publicly accessible spaces including allotments (Genter et al. 2015), cemeteries (Nordh et al. 2017), and other features such as street trees, playing fields, and areas of water (Taylor &amp; Hochuli, 2017). Associations have been found between the amount of, and proximity to, urban natural environments and better mental health, reduced risk of mental health disorders, mortality, and diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease (Gascon et al. 2015;Mitchell &amp; Popham, 2008;Nutsford, Pearson, &amp; Kingham, 2013;Twohig-Bennett &amp; Jones, 2018). Health is a multidimensional construct, encompassing physical, mental and social domains (Lovell, 2018); this breadth is reflected in the range of health and wellbeing outcomes which have been investigated in relation to natural environments. These spaces, it has been argued, can, depending on their features and accessibility, be used for relaxation, physical activity, building and maintaining social contacts, and spending time with friends and family. These uses are all activities that support different domains of health and may, therefore, contribute to positive health and wellbeing (Twohig-Bennett &amp; Jones, 2018).</p>
        <p>In objective terms, however, the most commonly researched form of urban natural environment, publically accessible green spaces such as parks and public gardens (Office for National Statistics (ONS), 2019), are often relatively limited in urban areas. Competing demands on land use, including housing or commercial activity, mean that it is difficult for planners to increase their total area (Zhao &amp; Li, 2017). As a result, there is growing interest in gaining a better understanding of the role other types of urban natural environments could play in health and wellbeing promotion and how the provision and use of such areas could deliver these benefits. Domestic gardens, defined as 'the area adjacent to a domestic dwelling, which itself is either privately owned or rented' so excluding public and communal gardens (Cameron et al. 2012, p. 129), are a particularly interesting case in point. In Great Britain, whilst ~5% of land cover in urban areas is publically accessible green space, ~30% is private gardens -approximately 530,000 hectares (ONS, 2018) -and 87% of the population have access to a private garden (Davies et al. 2009). The aim of the current research was therefore to explore the potential benefit of gardens using a representative sample of the adult population of England. Domestic gardens are a relatively neglected element in natural environment-health research (Dennis &amp; James, 2017). Many analyses investigating the benefits of neighbourhood urban natural environments exclude gardens altogether (e.g. Mitchell &amp; Popham, 2008;Nutsford, Pearson, &amp; Kingham, 2013). Others have found the association between neighbourhood urban natural environments and health is not affected by the exclusion of gardens from their models (e.g. Alcock et al., 2015;White et al. 2013). However, gardens represent a significant proportion of the natural environments that people are likely to experience in their day to day lives, offering a number of potential benefits and dis-benefits. They provide an opportunity for direct exposure and contact with nature, supporting similar activities to publically accessible green space in terms of use as well as further benefits such as representing a space for growing food. They are also a potential source of allergens and pests (Campbell-Arvai, 2018;Gaston et al. 2005;Freeman et al. 2012). Studies in the field of ecosystem services have found that garden owners consider cultural services, including promotion of wellbeing, to be the some of the most important benefits provided by gardens (Calvet-Mir et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>The benefits of gardens have previously been economically valued using hedonic analysis.</p>
        <p>Property prices indicate that houses with large gardens sell for a higher price than those with small gardens (Lake et al. 2000), whilst a 1% increase in the area of domestic gardens in a particular district has been shown to lead to a 1% increase in house price (Gibbons, Mourato &amp; Resende, 2014).</p>
        <p>Untangling a) the connections between garden availability and use on the provision of benefits, and b) interactions between domestic gardens and the availability and use of other forms of urban natural environments such as publically accessible green space, is needed to inform urban planning and public health strategies.</p>
        <p>Whilst the few previous studies on gardening have tended to be small-scale and often in nonrepresentative populations (Soga, Gaston, &amp; Yamaura, 2017;Genter et al. 2015), recent analyses have considered associations between gardens and health at a population level in England. Dennis &amp; James (2017) found an association between domestic garden coverage and reduced health deprivation. Brindley, Jorgensen, &amp; Maheswaran (2018) showed that smaller gardens are associated with a higher prevalence of self-reported poor health and found greater income-related inequalities in health in areas with smaller gardens relative to those with larger gardens.</p>
        <p>Health benefits have been linked to directly experienced aspects of gardens. After beaches and forests, private gardens are considered to be the natural spaces which contribute most to enhancing wellbeing by people in England (Church et al. 2014). Different types of gardening activity are associated with physical and mental health benefits in domestic (Soga, Gaston, &amp; Yamaura, 2017), therapeutic or institutional settings (Joyce &amp; Warren, 2016;Ohly et al. 2016;Soga, Gaston, &amp; Yamaura, 2017;Whear et al. 2014). Communal gardening, whether directly through a community garden (Kingsley, Townsend, &amp; Henderson-Wilson, 2009), or indirectly through the shared space of an allotment (Genter et al. 2015), has been linked to positive health outcomes such as lower body mass index (BMI) (Audate et al. 2019;Kunpeuk et al. 2019). The promotion of social networks and cohesion are thought to be particularly important in the provision of benefits from communal gardening (Soga, Gaston, &amp; Yamaura, 2017;Nordh et al. 2016;Wood et al. 2016;Kingsley, Townsend, &amp; Henderson-Wilson, 2009). Exposure to nature and the wildlife gardens support has also been linked to health, wellbeing and quality of life outcomes (White et al. 2018;Cox &amp; Gaston, 2015;Cox &amp; Gaston, 2016;Fuller et al. 2012;Gaston et al. 2007). Domestic gardens are an important element of green infrastructure so impact indirectly on health by contributing to the provision of ecosystem services in both urban and rural areas (Cox et al. 2019;Cameron et al. 2012;Cabral et al. 2017;Tratalos et al. 2007). These benefits may therefore extend beyond garden owners, for example trees in private gardens have been found to be more important than those in publically accessible green spaces in providing indirect nature experiences within neighbourhoods (Cox et al. 2019).</p>
        <p>Garden provision could potentially reduce people's visits to other urban natural environments through a substitution or compensation effect (Maat &amp; Vries, 2006). However, there is some evidence that those with gardens may be more likely to visit natural environments such as green spaces, whether due to their sense of connection with nature, or likelihood of having access to green space in the neighbourhood (Lin et al. 2014). Conversely, Syme, Fenton, &amp; Coakes (2001) found that whilst people with small gardens were more likely to visit wetlands than those with larger gardens, there was no effect on park visitation. Similarly, further quantitative (Lin et al. 2014) and qualitative research (Farahani et al. 2018) from Australia found no evidence of a substitution effect.</p>
        <p>The extent and connectivity of natural spaces in urban areas are under increasing pressure as a result of population growth, housing demand and increasing land values (Lin et al. 2017). It is, therefore, important to understand the benefits and dis-benefits of gardens for human health and wellbeing, particularly the implications of garden access for reducing health inequalities and how they might affect the use of other urban natural environments.</p>
        <p>This study addresses gaps in the literature identified in the previous section regarding the direct health benefits of gardens. Specifically, we investigated whether: (i) garden access is associated with health and wellbeing; (ii) garden use is associated with health and wellbeing; and (iii) there is evidence of garden access and use resulting in a substitution effect with the use of other urban natural environments.</p>
        <p>Data from the English Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey were obtained for secondary analysis. The MENE is part of a weekly, repeat cross-sectional omnibus survey conducted in England throughout the year. It is commissioned by Natural England, a non-governmental body sponsored by the UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and is part of the UK government's national statistics.</p>
        <p>Sampling is therefore undertaken to ensure that respondents are representative of the adult population of England. The survey is delivered face-to-face in the home by trained interviewers who follow a computer assisted script and recording protocol (Natural England, 2018). The survey is structured such that some questions are asked in every weekly wave (i.e. of all study participants), some in one wave per month (so only asked of around a quarter of the sample) and some in one wave per quarter (around 8% of the sample). For this study, anonymised data at the individual level were drawn from the first seven waves of the survey (2009/10 -2015/16).</p>
        <p>Information on garden access was obtained from the following question in the MENE: Which of the following best applies to you …?, with possible answers being 'I have access to a private garden', 'I have access to a private communal garden', 'I have access to a private outdoor space but not a garden (balcony, yard, patio area)', or 'I don't have access to a garden'. As the question referred to all garden types as private, we interpreted all to be domestic gardens as defined in the introduction: an area next to a private dwelling (Cameron et al. 2012). We interpreted 'private garden' as being a space containing vegetation and a 'private outdoor space' to have hard surfacing as in the examples given in the question. We did not make any assumptions regarding vegetation or paving in 'private communal gardens' but interpreted them as accessible to residents of more than one dwelling e.g. a garden associated with flats. This question is asked quarterly. 'Garden use' was derived from two possible responses to a question on respondent's activities in the natural environment. Respondents were asked 'Which of the following activities involving the natural environment do you take part in? Please choose everything you do, both regularly and occasionally' and a number of activities, such as watching or listening to nature programmes, looking at books, photos or websites about the natural world, and watching wildlife, were listed. This question is asked quarterly. We focused on the two possible answers which definitely took place in gardens; these were 'Gardening' or 'Sitting or relaxing in a garden'. For current purposes, we take 'gardening' to refer to the physically active activity, categorised as a moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) of 4 metabolic equivalents of task (METs) (White et al. 2016;Ainsworth et al. 2011), whilst sitting and relaxing is taken to be a sedentary activity. Respondents could report taking part in either or both of these activities, so we categorised them into four groups: 1) those who neither gardened nor relaxed in the garden; 2) those who relaxed in the garden; 3) those who gardened; or 4) those who both gardened and relaxed in the garden.</p>
        <p>Four health outcome variables (general health; evaluative wellbeing; eudaimonic wellbeing; and physical activity) were derived from responses to questions in the MENE. Questions on general health and both evaluative and eudaimonic wellbeing are asked monthly whilst details on physical activity are asked weekly.</p>
        <p>For general health, respondents were asked 'How is your health in general?' on a five-point scale from 'Very good' to 'Very bad', as used in many health surveys and the UK Census.</p>
        <p>Evaluative wellbeing and eudaimonic wellbeing are measured using two questions on subjective wellbeing developed by the ONS (Waldron, Tinkler, &amp; Hicks, 2010): 'Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?' and 'Overall to what extent do you feel that the things you do in your life are worthwhile?'. Respondents answered on a scale from 0 to 10, where zero was 'not at all satisfied' and ten was 'completely satisfied'. The distribution of all three measures had large skews towards the positive end of the scale so were dichotomised around the median into binary variables, with scores of 1-3 or 0-7 being 'low' and 4-5 or 8-10 being 'high' for the respective questions (as in White et al. (2017)).</p>
        <p>Regarding physical activity, the MENE survey includes the question "In the past week, on how many days have you done a total of 30 min or more physical activity which was enough to raise your breathing rate? This may include sport, exercise, and brisk walking or cycling for recreation or to get to and from places, but should not include housework or physical activity that may be part of your job". Government guidelines for physical activity recommend 150 minutes or more per week (Bull &amp; The Expert Working Groups, 2010). One way of achieving this is through 30 minutes of exercise on at least 5 days per week, so we categorised respondents as meeting or not meeting the physical activity guidelines based on their response to this question.</p>
        <p>Our final outcome final outcome variable indicated the frequency respondents had visited nature in the past year. This variable was derived from the question 'Thinking about the last 12 months, how often, on average, have you spent your leisure time out of doors, away from your home.* By out of doors we mean open spaces in and around towns and cities, the coast and the countryside. This could be anything from a few minutes to all day. It may include time spent close to your home, further afield or while on holiday in England. However, this does not include routine shopping trips or time spent in your own garden'. This question is asked weekly. Possible responses were: (i) more than once per day; (ii) every day; (iii) several times a week; (iv) once a week; (v) once or twice a month; (vi) once every 2-3 months; (vii) once or twice; and (viii) never. We collapsed the first four options into 'More than once a week' and latter four options into 'Less than once a week'.</p>
        <p>We controlled for a number of individual and area-level variables which are associated with health and wellbeing and likely to be related to garden access and use. Data used was collected as part of the MENE survey.</p>
        <p>The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score (Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), 2008) and percentage of urban natural environment (excluding gardens) and domestic garden coverage in the neighbourhood were derived from respondents' Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) of residence. Green space and garden area density measures were obtained from the Generalised Land Use Database, as used in a number of earlier studies (eg. White et al. 2013;White et al. 2017). For ease of interpretation, quintiles were calculated for each measure for inclusion in the models as area-level control variables. The lowest and highest categories for these were: IMD (0.00 -10.00=reference, 40.60 -87.80); public green space (0.00 -12.70=reference, 62.80 -98.60); and garden coverage (0.00-8.00=reference, 40.90 -71.00).</p>
        <p>Controls included in the models were: gender (male=reference); age (16-34 years=reference, 35-64 years, ≥65 years); occupational social grade of the main income earner as a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) with AB being the highest status occupations e.g. higher managerial positions and DE the lowest e.g. semi-or unskilled manual roles (AB, C1, C2, DE=reference) (Ipsos-MORI, 2009); employment status (full-time=reference, part-time, in education, not working, retired, unemployed/not working); marital status (married/living as married=reference, single, separated/divorced/widowed); children in household (any, none=reference); home ownership (owned outright, mortgage=reference, rented local authority, rented private, other); dog ownership (yes, no=reference).</p>
        <p>Respondents to the MENE survey have been asked about activities in the garden since 2009 so this sample was larger (n=24631) than that on garden access, as the question on garden access was introduced in May 2014 (Natural England, 2018). We included only respondents who answered both questions in our analysis (n=7,814). Due to some missing data, our sample size was smaller for two of the health outcomes: general health (n=6,907) and eudaimonic wellbeing (n=5,173).</p>
        <p>All analyses were conducted in R v3.5.1. We ran three sequential binary logistic regression models for each of the four health outcomes and for the likelihood of visiting nature once a week. These models investigated the association between the five outcomes and (Model 1) garden access alone; (Model 2) garden access and garden use; and (Model 3) garden access and garden use, adjusted for individual and area-level potential confounders. A similar approach building from crude to fully adjusted models is taken by other studies e.g. Dean et al. (2018), White et al. (2017), and allows exploration of the extent to which garden access and activity explain the outcomes before and after adjustment for confounding. Linear models were also run for general health, evaluative wellbeing, eudaimonic wellbeing and physical activity as a sensitivity analysis as in White et al. (2019); these models can be found in the Supplementary Material. As there was little difference in the fully adjusted models and the outcome variables were highly skewed, we report the results of the binary models here in the main text.</p>
        <p>The socio-demographic characteristics of the sample can be found in Tables 1 and2. Results from the models are reported in sections 3.1, 3.2 and in Table 3; all odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) refer to models adjusted for individual and area-level variables.</p>
        <p>There were variations in garden access between groups. Fewer people in the youngest age category had access to a private garden: 69.7% compared to 79.9% among those age 35 to 64 and 85.6% of those aged over 65. Younger people were more likely to have no garden access (18.3%), whereas only 10.0% (8.3%) of those over 65 did not have a garden. Whilst the majority of respondents in all SES groups had access to a private garden, only 6.3% of those in AB had no access to a garden compared with 17.1% of those in the DE group. Consistent with the age findings, retired people had the highest proportion of private garden access (84.9%); economic activity groups that had the lowest proportion of access to private garden included those who were in education or not working (70%). Only 5.3% of respondents who were homeowners and 5.2% who had a mortgage did not have access to a private garden, compared to 20.8% of private renters and 24.3% of people renting from local authorities. Similar variation was observed for garden use. Almost half (48.5%) of people aged over 65 gardened and relaxed in their garden, whereas less than a quarter (23.8%) of people aged 16 to 34 used the garden for both of these activities. However, more 16 to 34 year olds used their garden for relaxing than any other age category. People who participated in either gardening or relaxing in the garden were distributed fairly evenly between SES groups but 52.1% of those in the AB group used the garden for both activities, compared to 30.1% in the DE group. Almost half (48.6%) of retired people gardened and relaxed in their garden, a higher proportion than any other employment category. The largest percentage of people who did not use the garden was found among those in education or not working. The lowest number of people using their garden for both activities were those who were renting.</p>
        <p>In the unadjusted models of garden access (Model 1), respondents with access to a private garden had significantly greater odds of reporting high evaluative and eudaimonic wellbeing, meeting physical activity guidelines, and visiting nature once a week compared to people with no garden access.</p>
        <p>Those with access to a communal garden reported significantly worse general health than those with no garden but were more likely to visit nature once a week. Respondents with access to an outdoor space such as a yard or balcony were also more likely to visit nature once a week than those with no garden as well as being more likely to meet physical activity guidelines. Of note the explanatory power of gardens in these models was modest, ranging from 7 to 19%.</p>
        <p>In Model 2, the inclusion of respondents' participation in activities in the garden in the models resulted in private garden or outdoor space access no longer being associated with eudaimonic wellbeing or visiting nature. Private garden access continued to be associated with evaluative wellbeing, whilst meeting physical activity guidelines was associated with having access to a private outdoor space. Respondents with a communal garden were more likely to report poor general health compared to those with no garden, as in the model which did not include participation in garden activities.</p>
        <p>Garden activities were associated with the outcome variables after adjusting for garden access (again Model 2). Those who used the garden for any activity (relaxing in the garden, gardening, or both of these activities) were more likely than those who did not use it to report higher eudaimonic wellbeing and visiting nature once a week. Those who both gardened and relaxed in the garden were also more likely to report good general health, high evaluative wellbeing, and meeting physical activity guidelines than those who did neither. Compared with those who took part in no garden activities, respondents who only gardened had better general health whilst those who only relaxed reported higher evaluative wellbeing.</p>
        <p>After adjustment for individual and area-level covariates in Model 3, garden access became associated with some outcomes. Owning a private garden was associated with higher evaluative wellbeing than having no garden (OR 1.22, CI 1.02-1.47). Those who had access to a private outdoor space were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines (OR 1.54, 1.15-2.05).</p>
        <p>Using the garden for both relaxing and gardening was associated with reporting better outcomes in all five models: general health (OR 1.48, CI 1.26-1.74), evaluative wellbeing (OR 1.48, CI 1.27-1.74), eudaimonic wellbeing (OR 1.88, CI 1.56-2.26), physical activity (OR 1.44, CI 1.24-1.67), and visiting nature (OR 1.90, CI 1.66-2.16), compared with doing neither activity. As before adjustment, using the garden for relaxing or gardening were also associated with reporting high eudaimonic wellbeing (relaxing OR 1.29, CI 1.07-1.55; gardening OR 1.53, CI 1.19-1.98) and visiting nature once a week (relaxing OR 1.26, CI 1.10-1.44; gardening OR 1.36, CI 1.14-1.62). Gardening remained associated with reporting better general health (OR 1.56, 1.26-1.95) and became associated with meeting physical activity guidelines (OR 1.24, CI 1.02-1.51). However, after adjustment, relaxing in the garden was no longer associated with reporting higher evaluative wellbeing.</p>
        <p>Fig. 1 presents a comparison of associations between garden use and being in the highest SES group and health and wellbeing, meeting physical activity guidelines, and visiting nature once a week, using fully adjusted ORs from Model 3. Both garden use and high SES were associated with higher odds of reporting good health and wellbeing and being more likely to meet physical activity guidelines and visit nature once a week. The ORs were similar, and in most cases larger, for garden use.</p>
        <p>In our final models (Model 3), which were fully adjusted for both individual and area-level covariates, access to a private outdoor space was associated with positive health and wellbeing outcomes. Private garden owners reported higher evaluative wellbeing than respondents with no garden, whilst people with access to a private space such as a yard were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines. Reported use of the garden was important in deriving benefits: compared to people who did not use the garden, respondents who both relaxed in the garden and gardened had better general health, mental wellbeing, higher levels of physical activity and visited nature more frequently. People who reported using the garden for one of these activities had higher eudaimonic wellbeing than those who did not use the garden, and gardeners were also more likely to meet physical activity guidelines.</p>
        <p>We found that access to a private space, whether a garden or other outdoor area, has benefits for health and wellbeing. There is limited research into the links between gardens and health at a neighbourhood level but our results are supported by previous studies which have found associations between garden coverage, reduced health deprivation (Dennis &amp; James, 2017), and poor health (Brindley, Jorgensen, &amp; Maheswaran, 2018). Similarly to Cervinka et al. (2016), who found that gardens were rated as more restorative than other private spaces, we found that only private garden access was associated with wellbeing. More broadly, research has shown that living in a greener neighbourhood, to which private gardens contribute, is associated with better mental and physical health (Alcock et al. 2015;Nutsford, Pearson, &amp; Kingham, 2013;White et al. 2013;Twohig-Bennett &amp; Jones, 2018). Our findings suggest that private green spaces are important in providing these benefits as well as other urban natural environments.</p>
        <p>The results also indicate that using gardens may play a major role in deriving benefits from them. Both of the activities we focused on, gardening and sitting and relaxing in the garden, were associated with health and wellbeing. In models of eudaimonic wellbeing and visiting nature once a week, the addition of garden activities led to the type of garden access no longer being significant, indicating that the benefits of having garden access are explained by actual garden use. Domestic or everyday gardening has been linked with positive physical and mental health outcomes in previous small-scale studies (Soga, Gaston, &amp; Yamaura, 2017); our study provides evidence for this association at a larger scale and in a representative sample. Respondents who relaxed and gardened or who only gardened were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines, whereas those who only relaxed were not. These activities were only significant in models which had been fully adjusted for sociodemographic variables which could confound the association, suggesting that gardening is contributing to meeting the guidelines. Government policy increasingly recognises and promotes everyday, as well as intentional or sport-related, activities such as gardening as a key means of increasing population-level physical activity (NHS, 2018). Our findings highlight the importance of activities which people might not typically consider 'exercise' in contributing to health. In terms of wellbeing, garden use may have an additive effect in providing benefits; garden owners reported higher life satisfaction, whilst using the garden was associated with eudaimonic wellbeing, feeling life is worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Private gardens and private outdoor spaces were the two types of garden most associated with positive health outcomes. This may reflect some of the socio-demographic variations seen in garden access and use. It also suggests that privacy, and the security it affords, may be an important aspect in the provision of benefits by domestic gardens (Cameron et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>Further, the ownership of a private garden or outdoor space avoids the inherent potential for conflict in the design, management and use of shared spaces. People with access to a communal garden may have no actual agency over what it contains or how it is used (Buck, 2016), and we did see a negative association between general health and reporting access to a communal garden in the unadjusted model. A private garden can afford the opportunity to craft and nurture one's own space, and to express and act on identity and values (Freeman et al. 2012).</p>
        <p>Although it has been suggested that access to a private garden may reduce people's visits to publically accessible green space through a substitution or compensation effect (Maat &amp; Vries, 2006), we found the opposite, with people who used their gardens being more likely to visit other urban natural environments. Lin et al. (2014) also found that people who visited green space were more likely to spend time in their garden which they attributed to 'orientation' as these people were more connected with nature. Connection with nature has been associated with positive health outcomes (Capaldi, Dopko, &amp; Zelenski, 2014;Dean et al. 2018) as well as with visiting nature more frequently (Lin et al. 2014;Soga &amp; Gaston, 2016). It may therefore be a pathway through which garden access and use benefits health.</p>
        <p>Gardens can provide multiple benefits as part of the urban green infrastructure, from food production to noise mitigation (ONS, 2018). However, their role as a health resource needs further recognition. Urbanisation and a growing population are placing pressure on local authorities and developers to provide houses, and at a greater density, whether in existing urban areas or in new developments (Wilson &amp; Barton, 2018). Gardens are currently an extensive resource (ONS, 2018) but with increasing pressure on budgets, urban natural environments of all types are in danger of being cut to make savings or maximise profits. Our findings demonstrate the importance of gardens and private outdoor spaces for both the physical and mental health of the community and indicate that other urban natural environments are not substitutable. There is some indication from previous studies that garden size is important, with smaller gardens providing fewer health benefits (Brindley, Jorgensen, &amp; Maheswaran, 2018), whilst larger gardens are more likely to be used and have different characteristics e.g. more tree cover (Lin et al. 2017). Our results also indicate the type of space is important, with the provision of health benefits differing between gardens and other outdoor spaces e.g. balconies, yards or patios. As with publically accessible green space, whilst there are recommendations for minimum garden size, there may be a need for standards or guidelines regarding garden characteristics and to prevent their loss to other land uses (Chalmuin-Pui et al. 2019). Private gardens appear to be most important in the provision of benefits, so aspects such as whether spaces are overlooked need greater consideration in green infrastructure planning and the implementation of nature-based solutions.</p>
        <p>Our findings regarding the health benefits of the use of gardens have implications for the development of public health messages relating to gardening. We showed that those who reported gardening reported better general health and were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines. Our findings support the recognition of gardening as a route to the achievement of the recommended physical activity guidelines. Prior research has found that gardening becomes more important as people age and is one of the most active pastimes of older people (Buck, 2016). Gardening may, therefore, represent an alternative activity which appeals to those who are less interested in other forms of exercise, such as competitive sports, with the potential to promote higher rates of activity in traditional harder to reach groups e.g. people from ethnic minorities or low-income groups (Bonevski et al. 2014). Our findings support the value of efforts to promote garden use in the general population. These include programmes such as the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Support for School Gardening which aims to help children to learn about gardening (RHS, n. d.); gardening is also recommended as an activity by the NHS Get Active Your Way campaign (NHS, 2018).</p>
        <p>However, we recommend that further promotion activities are needed, specifically those which target groups who could benefit most; these would, however, need to be sensitive to the socio-economic inequalities in access to private gardens noted in this analysis.</p>
        <p>The strengths of this study lie in the use of a large-scale dataset from a national survey, with the sample being representative of the English population. However, the limitations of the use of data resulting from self-reported aspects of the survey should be noted. We assumed that all private gardens had natural features but they may have only had a patio, meaning they could have been classed as a 'private outdoor space'. As people were offered these two alternatives side by side, we think the number of misclassifications is likely to be small but given that the MENE is conducted as part of an in-home interview, future iterations might ask interviewers to check the status of garden and make their own assessment on the presence of natural features. We also do not know if the garden activities in which people participated took place in the respondent's own garden. As a result of our findings and these limitations, we have some suggestions for future research into the association between gardens and health.</p>
        <p>We found no evidence of a substitution effect between garden access and visiting other urban natural environments. However, we were relying on self-reported visits to these spaces. The question of substitution is important for urban planning so merits detailed study using actual visit data, considering the frequency and duration of people's visits as well as comparison of the use of gardens and other urban natural environments in terms of types and intensity of activity. There are also further questions relating to the influence of the type and characteristics of the garden on health outcomes. Although we could distinguish between private gardens and outdoors spaces such as yards or patios, we had no further information on the qualities of the space, such as whether they contained plants, trees or water, or whether they were covered in artificial surfacing. Different features are likely to afford different experiences and uses and some, such as trees, may provide benefits to people beyond the garden owner (Cox et al. 2019). A connected avenue of research is needed investigating why these different spaces are beneficial, for example, the importance of giving people agency over garden design and whether communal gardens might offer benefits if people had more involvement in their management. This would aid understanding of how the integration of different characteristics may facilitate or promote health and wellbeing outcomes. We were also unable to investigate variation in outcomes between different social and demographic groups to a greater degree due to small sample sizes for some categories. Further research into the distribution and equity of opportunity and benefits is needed and would help craft public health messages and inform planning and green infrastructure standards.</p>
        <p>Understanding positive relationships between garden use and health, such as the contribution of gardening to meeting physical activity guidelines, is important. However, there is the potential for negative interaction with the garden (Cameron et al. 2012). Maintaining the garden, for example, demands time, carries the risk of injury, and depending on a person's abilities may not be achievable (Cameron et al. 2012). Further research is needed into how we provide and design appropriate garden or outdoor spaces for different needs and desires.</p>
        <p>The development of co-beneficial ownership and management models where, for example, young or transient populations with no gardens work with older households, for whom gardening may have become a burden, to look after their gardens may also be of value. There is also a need to develop our understanding of the implications of planning and developing complex 'private-public spaces', as exemplified by recent controversies in the UK regarding unequal access to outdoors spaces (eg. Grant, Mohdin &amp; Michael, 2019).</p>
        <p>This study of a representative sample of the English population demonstrates the link between gardens and health and wellbeing outcomes, finding positive effects of private garden access, gardening and other uses of gardens for both wellbeing and physical activity levels. These findings have important implications for the planning and development of urban areas, providing evidence there may be a need for private green and outdoor spaces alongside publically accessible green spaces. They also establish the benefits of gardens to public health, further clarifying their role in helping individuals to meet physical activity guidelines and promote wellbeing. Gardens have been relatively neglected in the study of green spacehealth. Further research is needed to better understand the characteristics and pathways responsible for the provision of benefits by gardens and how to harness the health benefits associated with the use of these spaces.</p>
