        <p>An updated version of the checklist of birds of Brazil is presented, along with a summary of the changes approved by the Brazilian Ornithological Records Committee's Taxonomy Subcommittee since the first edition, published in 2015. In total, 1971 bird species occurring in Brazil are supported by documentary evidence and are admitted to the Primary List, 4.3% more than in the previous edition. Eleven additional species are known only from undocumented records (Secondary List). For each species on the Primary List, status of occurrence in the country is provided and, in the case of polytypic species, the respective subspecies present in Brazilian territory are listed. Explanatory notes cover taxonomic changes, nomenclatural corrections, new occurrences and other changes implemented since the last edition.An updated version of the checklist of birds of Brazil is presented, along with a summary of the changes approved by the Brazilian Ornithological Records Committee's Taxonomy Subcommittee since the first edition, published in 2015.

        <p>In contrast, eight species are synonymized or assigned subspecific status and thus removed from the Primary List. In all, 293 species are endemic to Brazil, ranked third among the countries with the highest rate of bird endemism. The Brazilian avifauna currently consists of 1742 residents or breeding migrants, 126 seasonal non-breeding visitors and 103 vagrants. The category of vagrants showed the greatest increase (56%) compared to the previous list, mainly due to new occurrences documented in recent years by citizen scientists. The list updates the diversity, systematics, taxonomy, scientific and vernacular nomenclature, and occurrence status of birds in Brazil.In contrast, eight species are synonymized or assigned subspecific status and thus removed from the Primary List.

        <p>The list is an open access scientific resource made available by CBRO for the benefit of many different potential users, including scientists, birders, wildlife managers, government agencies, educators and students, among others. In recent years, the CBRO checklist has been used as the baseline avian taxonomy in several initiatives carried out in Brazil, such as: i) the Red List assessment of Brazilian fauna (ICMBio 2018); ii) the largest citizen science data portal on Brazilian birds on the internet (www.wikiaves.com.br); iii) state-level consolidation of local lists of birds (e.g., Nunes et al. 2017;Franz et al. 2018); and iv) organization and management of important scientific collections in the country (e.g., Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi -MPEG, Muzeu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo -MZUSP, Museu de Ciências Naturais -MCN). In this way, CBRO has provided a service that contributes to the development and dissemination of knowledge about Brazilian biodiversity and fulfills the purpose of facilitating communication between different users, going beyond the limits of scientific and academic circles.The list is an open access scientific resource made available by CBRO for the benefit of many different potential users, including scientists, birders, wildlife managers, government agencies, educators and students, among others.

        <p>In addition, as highlighted in previous editions of the checklist, the number of bird species recognized in Brazil by CBRO has increased substantially over the last few years. This is mainly due to recognition of species-level taxa previously considered subspecies following publication of studies using modern molecular techniques in combination with traditional morphological and bioacoustic analyses (Piacentini et al. 2015). This trend is expected to continue for years, perhaps decades, to come, as progress is made with ongoing taxonomic studies coupled with intensifying biodiversity inventory efforts, especially driven by contributions of citizen scientist birders. Therefore, it is essential that the checklist undergoes periodic updates to keep up with the dynamics of scientific knowledge about Brazilian avifauna. This way, it will continue to serve as an up-to-date reference on the diversity, systematics, taxonomy, nomenclature and occurrence status of Brazilian birds.In addition, as highlighted in previous editions of the checklist, the number of bird species recognized in Brazil by CBRO has increased substantially over the last few years.

        <p>Criteria and procedures for inclusion of species and for introduction of taxonomic changes in the list are those described in Piacentini et al. (2015, p. 93), with some adjustments (specified below). The CBRO system for scrutinizing taxonomic cases is based on discussion and subsequent vote by the 11 members of the Taxonomic Subcommittee. An overview of the structure, general procedures and definitions adopted in the list is provided below.Criteria and procedures for inclusion of species and for introduction of taxonomic changes in the list are those described in Piacentini et al.

        <p>The CBRO list is structured in three main sections, as follows: Primary List -Species for which there is at least one Brazilian record with associated documentary evidence. Documentation in this context means evidence available for independent verification, in the form of a complete or partial specimen, or rich media in the form of photographs, audio or video, which allow the unambiguous identification of the taxon (see also Carlos et al. 2010). Unlike Piacentini et al. (2015), in the present edition published records obtained with the use of geolocators or other remote tracking devices (henceforth, RTD; see a review of these devices in Marra et al. 2018) are regarded as acceptable evidence for admission to the Primary List. Such evidence is considered sufficiently robust and reliable as long as the precision of each method is observed, and especially where there is a negligible chance of identification errors arising from tagging birds in mixed breeding colonies of phenotypically similar species. Secondary List -Species for which published national records exist, but with either unknown or unavailable documentary evidence. All species included in this list are considered to be of probable occurrence in Brazil, as inferred from their distribution and dispersal patterns established based on currently available information. Tertiary List -Species for which there are specific published national records, but with questionable or invalid documentary evidence, in addition to being of unlikely occurrence in Brazil.The CBRO list is structured in three main sections, as follows: Primary List -Species for which there is at least one Brazilian record with associated documentary evidence.

        <p>The current checklist is an update of the last version published by CBRO (Piacentini et al. 2015). Species added to the list are those recently recorded for the first time in the country based on evidence accepted by CBRO, as well as those recently described or validated at the species level based on scientific literature with supporting data considered robust by the CBRO Taxonomy Subcommittee.The current checklist is an update of the last version published by CBRO (Piacentini et al. 2015).

        <p>The current list follows the systematic order of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society (Remsen et al. 2021), as of the 19 January 2021 update. This is because both CBRO and SACC use the same basic monophyly criterion in delimitation of large groups of birds (e.g., Orders, Families and Subfamilies), and which is based on the same phylogenetic studies focused on these large groups (e.g., Tello et al. 2009;Ohlson et al. 2013;Fuchs and Pons 2015). However, regarding species-level taxonomy, we notice that the CBRO and SACC lists differ to some extent, resulting in distinct species totals for Brazil. This discrepancy arises from the use of different species concepts by CBRO and SACC, the latter adhering to the Biological Species Concept and associated criteria for species delimitation (see below for the criteria adopted by the CBRO).The current list follows the systematic order of the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society (Remsen et al. 2021), as of the 19 January 2021 update.

        <p>Acceptance of new occurrences for the country is generally based on publications in which the circumstances of the original records are presented. Unpublished records with documental evidence deposited in citizen science web portals and online databases (WikiAves, Xeno-canto, and Macaulay Library/eBird) were also accepted when the authors of the media agreed with their incorporation into the list.Acceptance of new occurrences for the country is generally based on publications in which the circumstances of the original records are presented.

        <p>National bird records are those considered to be obtained unequivocally in Brazilian territory (Straube 2003) or within the limits of the Brazilian Baseline, which include the territorial sea (12 nautical miles), the contiguous zone (24 nautical miles), the exclusive economic zone (200 nautical miles), and the continental shelf, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 8617, of 04 January 1993 (Carvalho 1999;Straube 2003).National bird records are those considered to be obtained unequivocally in Brazilian territory (Straube 2003) or within the limits of the Brazilian Baseline, which include the territorial sea (12 nautical miles), the contiguous zone (24 nautical miles), the exclusive economic zone (200 nautical miles), and the continental shelf, in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 8617, of 04 January 1993 (Carvalho 1999;Straube 2003).</p>
        <p>To assess the limit and validity of species, CBRO adopts the General Lineage Species Concept (de Queiroz 2005;Aleixo 2007). Whenever new evidence that implies taxonomic changes at the species level is published, CBRO seeks to interpret them in the context of recent advances in the fields of speciation genetics, reproductive isolation, directional selection and hybridization dynamics (Gill 2014;Ottenburghs et al. 2017;Padial and De la Riva 2020).To assess the limit and validity of species, CBRO adopts the General Lineage Species Concept (de Queiroz 2005;Aleixo 2007).

        <p>According to the rationale proposed by Gill (2014), the "null hypothesis" behind the taxonomic decisions at the species level adopted by CBRO can be summarized as follows: sister, distinct and reciprocally monophyletic populations that are essentially reproductively isolated, i.e., do not interbreed freely if they occur in sympatry. Special care is taken not to implement taxonomic changes that are considered incomplete or probably temporary due to a lack of information about a particular taxon or a set of taxa that has been subject to recent systematic and/or taxonomic review (e.g., Mallet-Rodrigues and Gonzaga 2015; Manthey et al. 2016;Musher and Cracraft 2018).According to the rationale proposed by Gill (2014), the "null hypothesis" behind the taxonomic decisions at the species level adopted by CBRO can be summarized as follows: sister, distinct and reciprocally monophyletic populations that are essentially reproductively isolated, i.e., do not interbreed freely if they occur in sympatry.

        <p>The basis of the taxonomic decisions and treatments adopted by CBRO are scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. In particular, proposals derived from studies conducted under a "multi-character" approach and that incorporate as much phenotypic and genetic evidence as possible are more likely to be adopted by the Committee (Sangster 2018).The basis of the taxonomic decisions and treatments adopted by CBRO are scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals.

        <p>Regarding molecular characters, studies that focus on several genes at a genomic level take precedence over those that rely on smaller sets of genes or are based on a single locus (e.g., mitochondrial DNA). It is important to note that the adoption of a taxonomic treatment by CBRO does not necessarily imply unanimous approval by members of the Taxonomy Subcommittee. Adoption of a new taxonomic proposal requires at least 70% approval by the voting members. Thus, there are situations in which one or more authors of this work disagree with the treatment adopted here.Regarding molecular characters, studies that focus on several genes at a genomic level take precedence over those that rely on smaller sets of genes or are based on a single locus (e.g., mitochondrial DNA).

        <p>The CBRO list, as traditionally implemented since the first version, continues to indicate the full authorship (even when multiple authors are involved) of taxa at all levels, from higher-level classification through to species and subspecies. In addition, the pattern of seasonal occurrence in the country is indicated for each species on the primary list by a letter code according to the following categories and definitions: Eventually, species indicated as visitors may be accompanied by "BR". This denotes that some reproduction has been reported in the country, but that most records are still derived from visitors.The CBRO list, as traditionally implemented since the first version, continues to indicate the full authorship (even when multiple authors are involved) of taxa at all levels, from higher-level classification through to species and subspecies.

        <p>Such abbreviations are eventually combined with the following: # = status assumed but not confirmed.

        <p>Since the concept of endemism depends on the spatial scale considered (Fattorini 2017), it should be noted that we used a regional (i.e., political) rather than an areal definition of endemism to assess the number of endemic bird species in Brazil (see Peterson and Watson 1998).Since the concept of endemism depends on the spatial scale considered (Fattorini 2017), it should be noted that we used a regional (i.e., political) rather than an areal definition of endemism to assess the number of endemic bird species in Brazil (see Peterson and Watson 1998).</p>
        <p>As in the previous edition (Piacentini et al. 2015), with the purpose of assisting in the understanding of the biological diversity of Brazilian birds, we continue to tentatively list the subspecies of birds in Brazil. This information aims to point out taxonomic complexes in need of revision and restricted range taxa/populations to be considered in public conservation policies. Inclusion of these subspecies is purely instrumental and should not be understood as a taxonomic validation by CBRO, especially given that concepts of species based on evolutionary lineages (General Phyletic, Phylogenetic, Evolutionary and the like) do not necessarily attribute any evolutionary meaning to subspecies. Thus, subspecies are included in the list as an indication of potentially valid taxa existing in the country based on their acceptance by at least one of the following recent reference works: Grantsau ( 2010 2014,2016), and IOC World Bird List 10.2 (Gill et al. 2020).As in the previous edition (Piacentini et al. 2015), with the purpose of assisting in the understanding of the biological diversity of Brazilian birds, we continue to tentatively list the subspecies of birds in Brazil.

        <p>This new edition of the Annotated Checklist of the birds of Brazil recognizes 1971 species on the Primary List (SI). Of this total, 1066 (54%) are monotypic, i.e., without any subspecies or "geographic races", while 905 (46%) are polytypic, i.e., divided into subspecies (trinomials) in at least one recent reference work. Among the polytypic species, 591 are represented in Brazil by more than one subspecies and 314 by a single one. In total, there are 3064 valid or potentially valid forms (distinct species and subspecies) occurring in the Brazilian territory. A further 11 species, for which records are based on observations only, make up the Secondary List (Supplementary Information S1).

        <p>The Primary List of this new edition of the Annotated Checklist of the birds of Brazil, with 1971 recognized species, represents a net increase of 82 species (or 4.3%) compared to the previous edition (Piacentini et al. 2015). More precisely, 90 species have been added and eight As already mentioned in the previous edition, we have not included in the checklist some species that have occurred, or even breed, in the country, but which are known or are The steady increase in the Brazilian avian checklist over the years and the considerable leap in species added with this latest installment make it clear that we are still far from cataloging the true bird diversity of the country. New species continue to be described in parallel with numerous taxonomic splits, in addition to a constant stream of new records for the country, which are typically the main source of additions in regions with better-known avifaunas. Thus, there is clearly still a need for responsible collecting and for trained taxonomists, a profession in decline throughout the world. At the same time, an impressive contribution can be recognized from the documentation available on public, collaborative data platforms, especially photographs and voice recordings made by citizen scientists who contribute not only physical evidence of the presence of species, but also the raw materials for future analyses of taxonomic status. Now more than ever, the science of ornithology and the popular activity of bird watching contribute to one another in a positive feedback of increasing knowledge that we hope this list stimulates even more.The Primary List of this new edition of the Annotated Checklist of the birds of Brazil, with 1971 recognized species, represents a net increase of 82 species (or 4.3%) compared to the previous edition (Piacentini et al. 2015).
