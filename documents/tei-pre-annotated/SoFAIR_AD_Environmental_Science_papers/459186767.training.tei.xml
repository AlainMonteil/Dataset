        <p>There has been an increase in the use of renewable energy sources over recent years, which has led to a strand of literature examining the determinants of renewable energy consumption.There has been an increase in the use of renewable energy sources over recent years, which has led to a strand of literature examining the determinants of renewable energy consumption.</p>
        <p>However, most of the research used linear estimation models while reviewing the determinants of renewable energy consumption and ignored the indirect effect of democratic institutions on renewable energy consumption. With the use of a panel threshold model, this paper demonstrates that democratic institutions play a significant role in renewable energy consumption. In countries in which the democratic rights of people are preserved better, higher economic growth leads to increased use of renewable energy consumption; however, there is a negative association between economic growth and renewable energy consumption in less democratic countries. Increased trade openness leads to lower growth rates of renewable energy consumption in less democratic countries, while increases in real oil prices lead to increased renewable energy consumption in less democratic countries but play no significant role in more democratic countries. The findings of this paper suggest that democratic institutions are vital in channelling economic resources (economic growth) to renewable energy, and increased trade openness is associated with lower rates of renewable energy deployment in less democratic countries.However, most of the research used linear estimation models while reviewing the determinants of renewable energy consumption and ignored the indirect effect of democratic institutions on renewable energy consumption.

        <p>The increased concerns over climate change, global warming, and energy security have led to increased use of renewable energy resources over the last years. The International Energy Agency (2019) forecasts that the world's total renewable-based power capacity will grow by 50% between 2019 and 2024. Given the global importance of renewable energy consumption, there is an increasing need to examine the determinants of renewable energy consumption. There has been an extensive literature that examined the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth (see e.g., Apergis andPayne, 2010, 2012;Omri, 2013;Ozturk and Bilgili, 2015;Bhattacharya et al., 2016;Inglesi-Lotz, 2016;Koçak and Şarkgüneşi, 2017;Chen et al., 2020 among many others). However, there is also an increased stream of literature that examined the determinants of renewable energy consumption (e.g., Baye et al., 2021;Brini et al., 2017;Gozgor et al., 2020;Luqman et al., 2019;Nguyen and Kakinaka, 2019;Omri and Nguyen, 2014;Ponce et al., 2020;Sadorsky 2009a;Sadorsky 2009b;Salim and Rafiq, 2012;Pereira da Silva et al., 2018 among many others).The increased concerns over climate change, global warming, and energy security have led to increased use of renewable energy resources over the last years.

        <p>Most of the existing streams of literature examined the effect of trade openness, GDP per capita, real oil prices, and CO2 emissions on renewable energy consumption. However, beyond the standard determinants of renewable energy consumption (e.g., trade openness, GDP per capita, real oil prices, and CO2 emissions), the importance of institutional quality for renewable energy consumption has been identified (Brunnschweiler, 2010;Bellakhal et al., 2019;Bourcet, 2020). Bourcet (2020) carries out a systematic literature review on empirical determinants of renewable energy consumption and suggests that there is an extensive literature that incorporated institutional quality measures in their estimations to measure the direct effect of institutional quality on renewable energy deployment (see e.g., Bayulgen and Ladewig, 2017;Cadoret and Padovano, 2016;Carley et al., 2017;Pfeiffer and Mulder, 2013;Uzar, 2020aUzar, , 2020b)). In this paper, we argue that institutional quality not only affects renewable energy consumption directly but also has an indirect effect on renewable energy consumption through its effect on other factors. For instance, Ren et al. (2021) demonstrated that corruption (a measure of institutional quality) increases the per capita carbon emissions in Chinese provinces. In other words, institutional quality may have an indirect effect on renewable energy consumption through its impact on other determinants.Most of the existing streams of literature examined the effect of trade openness, GDP per capita, real oil prices, and CO2 emissions on renewable energy consumption.

        <p>On the other hand, Pfeiffer and Mulder (2013) demonstrated that renewable energy technology diffusion in developing countries increases in more democratic regimes. Furthermore, in countries in which there is no democratic pressure, governments may be less concerned with environmental pollution and do not impose strict environmental regulations (Mukherjee and Chakraborty, 2013). In this context, Abban and Hasan (2021) examine the role of other political factors such as the government's ideology and demonstrated that the left and central-leaning governments promote more renewable energy compared to right-wing governments. Similarly, Fankhauser et al. (2015) examined the determinants of the number of climate change legislation. They found that democratic countries tend to pass more climate change legislation compared to the non-democratic ones. It also has been demonstrated that the NGOs and civil society organizations are also key in achieving sustainable development goals (Fransen, 2013), and the engagement of such organizations could be more effective in societies in which democratic rights are preserved (Fredriksson et al., 2005). Henceforth, we expect that the effect of the economic factors on the use of renewable energy consumption to be varying based on the quality of democratic institutions.On the other hand, Pfeiffer and Mulder (2013) demonstrated that renewable energy technology diffusion in developing countries increases in more democratic regimes.

        <p>To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of papers examined the potential nonlinear or heterogenous effects of renewable energy consumption determinants on renewable energy consumption by analysing different samples. For instance, Wang and Zhang (2021) examine the effect of free trade on renewable energy consumption by carrying out analysis for three samples of countries (i.e., high, upper-middle and lower-middle-income country samples). Similarly, Ali et al. (2020) demonstrate that the effect of financial development and renewable energy consumption on economic growth is different in countries that are politically free, partly free and not free. In a related paper, Bamati and Raoofi (2020) also argue that different factors (e.g., CO2 emissions, oil prices and GDP per capita) have a differing effect on renewable energy consumption depending on the development level by obtaining results in two samples (i.e., developed and developing countries). Finally, Shahzad et al. (2021) also examine determinants of renewable energy consumption for the group of 7 (G-7) and emerging seven (E-7) separately. All the above-mentioned papers examine the varying effects of independent variables on the dependent variable; however, their classification of samples was exogenously determined by the authors. In this paper, on the other hand, we will examine the heterogeneous effects of the renewable energy consumption determinants with the use of the dynamic threshold panel model identifying these heterogeneous effects endogenously.To the best of our knowledge, only a handful of papers examined the potential nonlinear or heterogenous effects of renewable energy consumption determinants on renewable energy consumption by analysing different samples.

        <p>Most of the existing literature that examined the determinants of the renewable energy consumption used linear estimation methods such as fully modified ordinary least square and dynamic ordinary least square (e.g., Sadorsky, 2009aSadorsky, , 2009b;;Salim and Rafiq, 2012), panel autoregressive distributed lag (e.g., Pereira da Silva et al., 2018), panel cointegration tests (e.g., Bhattacharya et al., 2016;Koçak andŞarkgüneşi, 2017 anddynamic system GMM (e.g., Omri andNguyen, 2014). A handful of papers in the literature employed specific methods to capture the potential non-linear and heterogeneous effects. Two methods that examine the non-linear effect of variables are the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL) developed by Shin et al. (2014) (see e.g., Tugcu and Topcu (2018) and Qamruzzaman and Jianguo (2020) for the use of non-linear ARDL method) and quantile regression analysis (see e.g., Asongu and Odhiambo, 2021). Even though these methods examine the non-linear effects of independent variables on the dependent variable, the chosen non-linear effects are also pre-determined exogenously. For instance, non-linear ARDL examines the impact of independent variables through positive and negative shocks, and the effect of independent variables is examined in pre-determined (specific) quartiles in quantile regression analysis. On the other hand, Chang et al. (2009) used the panel threshold regression method proposed by Hansen (1999) and found that countries characterized by high economic growth can respond to high energy prices with increases in renewable energy consumption. Similarly, Raza et al. (2020) employ the generalized panel threshold regression model of Hansen (2000) to examine the non-linear effect of financial development on renewable energy consumption. However, Hansen's (1999) method used by Chang et al. (2009) was developed for a static panel threshold model where regression coefficients can take on a small number of different values. Furthermore, Hansen's (2000) method used by Raza et al. (2020) assumes exogeneous slope regressors and threshold variable. In this paper, we utilize the dynamic threshold panel model of Seo and Shin (2016), which allows the endogeneity in both regressors and threshold variables. The other threshold models (Caner and Hansen, 2004;Kremer et al., 2013;Kourtellos et al., 2016) either rely on an exogenous threshold variable or are not applicable in the context of a dynamic panel model.

        <p>Our study contributes to the literature in a couple of ways. Firstly, most of the existing literature uses linear estimation methods to examine the determinants of renewable energy and ignores the potential non-linear effects. Furthermore, the existing literature examined the direct effect of institutions on renewable energy deployment and ignored the indirect effect of institutions on renewable energy consumption through its effect on other factors. To our knowledge, this paper contributes to the literature by examining the varying effects of determinants based on the quality of democratic institutions. Secondly, most of the existing literature carried out unit root tests that assume cross-sectional independence. However, it is almost certain that the macro-level data violates the cross-sectional independence assumption (Pesaran, 2015). Therefore, we use recently developed panel data methods to take into account the cross-sectional dependence, which is deemed to improve the power and size of the tests. Finally, to avoid the potential effect of sample selection bias, the empirical analysis considers a different set of samples.Our study contributes to the literature in a couple of ways.

        <p>There is a large stream of literature that highlights the importance of economic growth in the use of renewable energy. One strand of literature found a positive association between renewable energy consumption and economic growth (see e.g., Sadorsky, 2009a for G7 countries; Sadorsky, 2009b for emerging countries; Salim and Rafiq (2012) for Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Turkey; Chang et al. (2015) for France and the UK; Omri et al. (2015) for Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Pakistan, Spain, Switzerland, and the USA; Kahia et al. (2017) for 11 MENA countries; Rafindadi and Ozturk (2017) for Germany; Koçak and Şarkgüneşi (2017) for Albania, Georgia, and Romania; Pereira da Silva et al. ( 2018) for the sub-Saharan African countries, among many others). On the other hand, another stream of literature found a negative association between renewable energy consumption and economic growth (e.g., Bhattacharya et al., 2016;Marques and Fuinhas, 2012;Ocal and Aslan, 2013). The latter stream of literature (i.e., literature that found a negative association between renewable energy consumption and economic growth) suggests that the high costs of renewable energy deployment are probably being placed excessively upon the economy, which then leads to a deceleration in economic activity due to increased costs. For instance, Bhattacharya et al. (2016) found that the increased renewable energy consumption led to a decrease in output growth in India, Ukraine, the US, and Israel suggesting that these countries may continue to use non-renewable energy sources for the future growth process. In other words, the findings of the latter stream of the literature suggest that the increased economic growth could lead to lower use of renewable energy consumption.There is a large stream of literature that highlights the importance of economic growth in the use of renewable energy.

        <p>Historical increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have resulted from the provision of energy services (see e.g., Agliardi et al., 2017) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on renewable energy stressed the importance of renewable energy consumption in mitigating the effects of climate change (Edenhofer et al., 2011). The increased importance of reducing CO2 emissions to combat global climate change encourages countries to use more renewable energies and promote environmental protection.Historical increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have resulted from the provision of energy services (see e.g., Agliardi et al., 2017) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on renewable energy stressed the importance of renewable energy consumption in mitigating the effects of climate change (Edenhofer et al., 2011).

        <p>Henceforth, previous studies in examining the determinants of renewable energy also included CO2 emissions as part of the explanatory variables. For instance, Sadorsky (2009a) and (2009b) found that increases in CO2 emissions per capita are found to be a major driver behind per capita renewable energy consumption in G7 countries and emerging economies. Salim and Rafiq (2012) showed that the pollutant emissions were major drivers of renewable energy consumption in Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia. Omri and Nguyen (2014) also found that the increases in CO2 emissions were the main driver of renewable energy consumption irrespective of their sample classification. On the other hand, Apergis and Payne (2014) also found a positive association between CO2 emissions and renewable energy consumption when examined the relationship for the Central American countries. Mac Domhnaill and Ryan (2020) also demonstrated that higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions promoted renewable energy in electricity production in the European Union during the period 2000-2015. Finally, Nguyen and Kakinaka (2019) found a varying relationship between renewable consumption and CO2 emissions. Their findings suggest that renewable energy was positively associated with emissions in low-income countries, while the relationship between renewable energy consumption and emissions are negative in high-income countries.Henceforth, previous studies in examining the determinants of renewable energy also included CO2 emissions as part of the explanatory variables.

        <p>Oil is considered to be the most likely substitute for renewable energy for most of the countries, and oil prices should be included in the model as a substitute for renewable energy consumption. It is expected that oil prices and demand for renewable energy to have a positive relationship. The increase in oil prices should lower the demand for oil, and countries are more likely to switch to more efficient (or less costly) options such as renewable energy.Oil is considered to be the most likely substitute for renewable energy for most of the countries, and oil prices should be included in the model as a substitute for renewable energy consumption.

        <p>Even though the theoretical expectation is that oil prices and the renewable energy consumption is positively associated, both Sadorsky (2009a) and Omri and Nguyen (2014) found a small but negative relationship between oil prices and renewable energy consumption for G-7 and 64 countries, respectively. On the other hand, Brini et al. ( 2017) and Luqman et al. (2019) found that no significant relationship between oil prices and renewable energy consumption for Tunisia and Pakistan, respectively. On the other hand, Apergis and Payne (2014) showed that oil prices increase renewable energy consumption in Central American countries. Khan et al. (2017) examined the effect of the oil price drop in 2014 on renewable energy consumption and found no significant effect.Even though the theoretical expectation is that oil prices and the renewable energy consumption is positively associated, both Sadorsky (2009a) and Omri and Nguyen (2014) found a small but negative relationship between oil prices and renewable energy consumption for G-7 and 64 countries, respectively.

        <p>The previous literature argues that trade openness is a good proxy to measure the level of countries' engagement with other countries through the movement of goods and services, which would also enable countries to access renewable energy technologies and consequently use more renewable energy. The earlier stream of literature examined the relationship between trade openness and energy consumption (see e.g., Narayan and Smyth, 2009;Lean andSmyth, 2010a, 2010b;Sadorsky, 2011Sadorsky, , 2012)), while a new set of papers also highlighted the importance of trade openness for the use of renewable energy (Omri and Nguyen, 2014;Brini et al., 2017). Using a large panel data set, both Omri and Nguyen (2014) and Ben Jebli and Ben Youssef (2015) found that changes in trade openness have a statistically significant effect on renewable energy consumption except for high-income countries. Brini et al. (2017) also found that increased trade promoted renewable energy use in Tunisia. Similarly, Zeren and Akkuş (2020) also found that trade openness is a positive and significant determinant for renewable energy consumption for "Top Emerging Countries of Bloomberg" in the 1980-2015 period (see also Vural (2021) that found a positive effect of trade openness on renewable energy production in selected Latin American countries). However, trade openness could also lead to higher environmental degradation (see e.g., Le et al., 2016). Since democratic countries have a more substantial environmental commitment (Neumayer, 2002), and are more likely to pass climate change legislation (Fankhauser et al., 2015) compared to less democratic countries, the effect of trade openness on renewable energy may be different based on their institutional quality. For instance, a less democratic nation with less strict environmental policies (Fankhauser et al., 2015) may become a "pollution haven" for intensive economic production. In other words, trade openness of countries (i.e., total imports and exports as a percentage of GDP) may be increased through foreign direct investment, and the foreign direct investment flows to these countries may have increased due to their less strict environmental policies. Therefore, trade openness may have either a positive or negative effect on renewable energy consumption.The previous literature argues that trade openness is a good proxy to measure the level of countries' engagement with other countries through the movement of goods and services, which would also enable countries to access renewable energy technologies and consequently use more renewable energy. The earlier stream of literature examined the relationship between trade openness and energy consumption (see e.g., Narayan and Smyth, 2009;Lean andSmyth, 2010a, 2010b;Sadorsky, 2011Sadorsky, , 2012)), while a new set of papers also highlighted the importance of trade openness for the use of renewable energy (Omri and Nguyen, 2014;Brini et al., 2017). Using a large panel data set, both Omri and Nguyen (2014) and Ben Jebli and Ben Youssef (2015) found that changes in trade openness have a statistically significant effect on renewable energy consumption except for high-income countries. Brini et al. (2017) also found that increased trade promoted renewable energy use in Tunisia. Similarly, Zeren and Akkuş (2020) also found that trade openness is a positive and significant determinant for renewable energy consumption for "Top Emerging Countries of Bloomberg" in the 1980-2015 period (see also Vural (2021) that found a positive effect of trade openness on renewable energy production in selected Latin American countries). However, trade openness could also lead to higher environmental degradation (see e.g., Le et al., 2016). Since democratic countries have a more substantial environmental commitment (Neumayer, 2002), and are more likely to pass climate change legislation (Fankhauser et al., 2015) compared to less democratic countries, the effect of trade openness on renewable energy may be different based on their institutional quality. For instance, a less democratic nation with less strict environmental policies (Fankhauser et al., 2015) may become a "pollution haven" for intensive economic production. In other words, trade openness of countries (i.e., total imports and exports as a percentage of GDP) may be increased through foreign direct investment, and the foreign direct investment flows to these countries may have increased due to their less strict environmental policies. Therefore, trade openness may have either a positive or negative effect on renewable energy consumption.</p>

Therefore, before proceeding, we first examine the presence of cross-sectional dependence by using the crosssection dependence test of Pesaran (2004). Table 2 presents the results for the cross-section dependence test of Pesaran (2004). For all the variables considered (i.e., ln(REC), ln(GDP per capita), ln (CO2 per capita), ln(Oil) and ln(Trade)), the results suggest that the null hypothesis of cross-sectional independence is strongly rejected at the 1% significance level for three sets of samples (i.e., all, developing and developed countries). As such, we find that all of the variables are cross-sectionally correlated irrespective of the sample of countries used.The first generation of panel unit root tests that are based on the cross-sectional independence assumption (see e.g., Maddala and Wu, 1999;Choi, 2001;Levin et al., 2002;Im et al., 2003) and therefore these tests suffer from size distortions and the ignorance of cross-section dependence (Pesaran, 2015).

        <p>We use ( 2) and ( 5) to estimate the long-run linear and non-linear relationship between renewable energy and its determinants, respectively. Table 4 provides the results from the linear specifications where estimates are obtained by using the dynamic panel regression model (DPRM). Before presenting our results, we should highlight that we carried out the panel autocorrelation test for AR1 disturbances from Wooldridge (2002) where the p-values for the of the AR(1) test suggest that the dynamic model does not suffer from serial correlation as we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no serial correlation. Our findings suggest that the previous growth rate of renewable energy is negatively associated with the current growth rate suggesting that the overall growth of renewable energy consumption declined overtime for all the samples. Higher economic growth rates are negatively related to the growth of renewable energy consumption in the whole sample, but this relationship is positive for the developed country sample suggesting that countries with high economic growth tend to increase renewable energy consumption relatively more. The findings for the developed country sample are in line with the conclusions from Sadorsky (2009a), Chang et al. (2015), Omri et al.

One plausible explanation for this could be the pollution haven hypothesis. There has been significant evidence that foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade openness are positively related (see e.g., Aizenman and Noy, 2006;Biglaiser and de Rouen, 2006;Liargovas and Skandalis, 2012). Furthermore, countries with lack of strict environmental regulations and lower abatement costs (e.g., lower investment or use of renewable energy sources due to its higher cost) were found to be attracting more FDI flows (see e.g., Cole and Elliott, 2005;Kellenberg, 2009;Wagner and Timmins, 2009;Tang, 2015). Given that less democratic countries have less strict environmental regulations (Fankhauser et al., 2015), trade openness could have attracted more FDI and decreased deployment of renewable energy investment in less democratic countries. For instance, in a recent paper, Khan et al. (2021) found that FDI is negatively associated with renewable energy consumption for 69 countries of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Increased quality of democratic institutions would lead to more resource allocation to renewable energy use (i.e., economic growth) and promote more regulations in combating environmental pollution (Fredriksson et al., 2005). On the other hand, we find that oil prices have a significant and positive impact on renewable energy consumption in less democratic countries. Therefore, an increase in oil prices (e.g., through a higher tax on oil) would be a useful tool for promoting the growth of renewable energy consumption in less democratic countries.
