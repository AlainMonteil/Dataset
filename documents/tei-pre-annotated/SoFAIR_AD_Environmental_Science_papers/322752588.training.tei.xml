        <p>Climate change and increasing income inequality have emerged as twin threats to contemporary standards of living, peace and democracy. These two problems are usually tackled separately in the policy agenda. A new breed of radical proposals has been advanced to manage a fair low-carbon transition. In this spirit, we develop a dynamic macrosimulation model to investigate the long-run effects of three scenarios: Green Growth, Policies for Social Equity, and Degrowth. The Green Growth scenario, based on technological progress and environmental policies, achieves a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of increasing income inequality and unemployment. The Policies for Social Equity scenario adds direct labour market interventions that result in an environmental performance similar to Green Growth while improving social conditions at the cost of increasing public deficit.Climate change and increasing income inequality have emerged as twin threats to contemporary standards of living, peace and democracy.

        <p>The Degrowth scenario further adds a reduction in consumption and exports, and achieves a greater reduction in emissions and inequality with higher public deficit despite the introduction of a wealth tax. We argue that new radical social policies can combine social prosperity and low-carbon emissions and are economically and politically feasible.The Degrowth scenario further adds a reduction in consumption and exports, and achieves a greater reduction in emissions and inequality with higher public deficit despite the introduction of a wealth tax.

        <p>The main responses to the global challenge posed by climate change are currently based on green growth policy proposals 1 . A combination of market-incentive tools -such as carbon taxes, cap and trade schemes, and subsidies to resource-efficient innovation -is widely seen by governments and international institutions as the viable way to foster economic growth while mitigating its environmental impact 2 . The promises of green growth also include its ability to promote income distribution and job creation, however concrete recommendations are generally limited to targeted compensation policies for low-income households and moderate employment protection 3 .The main responses to the global challenge posed by climate change are currently based on green growth policy proposals 1 .

        <p>Despite its prominent position in the policy agenda, several drawbacks to green growth have been put forward. Environmental scientists and interdisciplinary researchers question the ability of market mechanisms to reduce environmental damage 4 , meet planetary boundaries 5,6 and avoid critical transitions 7,8 . Moreover, the evidence that new technologies reduce the correlation between growth and employment casts doubts on the capacity of green growth to create jobs 9 .Despite its prominent position in the policy agenda, several drawbacks to green growth have been put forward.

        <p>Two alternatives to green growth have gained traction thanks to their emphasis on the promotion of social equity. First, the "Green New Deal", recently advanced in the US, recognizes the need to complement environmental policies with direct actions to reduce inequality and unemployment 10 . Notwithstanding its ambitious goals, there is an ongoing debate as to whether decarbonization can be achieved with economic growth 11,12 .Two alternatives to green growth have gained traction thanks to their emphasis on the promotion of social equity.

        <p>A more radical argument in this debate comes from the degrowth literature. According to this second alternative, continuous economic growth and ecological sustainability are incompatible 13 and that the transition towards a sustainable society requires a downscale in consumption and pro-duction. Therefore, radical social policies -such as job guarantee programmes and working time reduction -become essential to sustain employment, reduce inequality and ensure prosperity [14][15][16] .A more radical argument in this debate comes from the degrowth literature.

        <p>We contribute to this debate by providing a dynamic macrosimulation model tailored to compare green growth and these two alternatives in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and income distribution. The simulation results shed light on the following questions. Are the current measures advocated for green growth at risk of fostering inequality and unemployment? If so, is there room for social policies to offset such harmful outcome? Is a downscale in consumption necessary to meet environmental targets?We contribute to this debate by providing a dynamic macrosimulation model tailored to compare green growth and these two alternatives in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and income distribution.

        <p>Our model relies on a post-Keynesian framework where production and employment dynamics are determined by effective demand owing to the fact that capital and labour are not fully utilized 17 . The model is also grounded in the ecological macroeconomics literature that aims to strengthen the ecological foundations of macroeconomics and shifts its focus to living well within planetary boundaries 18,19 . Compared to this stream of literature, we provide a more detailed specification of the social protection system by including multiple public revenues and expenditures to implement social and environmental policies. Furthermore, the distinction of the working age population by skill, the inclusion of wealth dynamics and financial incomes, and the heterogeneous industries modelled give a more accurate assessment of income distribution (see Figure 1).Our model relies on a post-Keynesian framework where production and employment dynamics are determined by effective demand owing to the fact that capital and labour are not fully utilized 17 .

        <p>The relation between environmental degradation and inequality is hardly new in the literature 20,21 . Although recent empirical studies have considered the effects of emissions and climate change on income distribution 22,23 , we approach this issue from a different perspective and con- sider how policies shape the relationship between inequality and emissions. Moreover, previous studies have often neglected the consequences of the joint implementation of multiple policies 24 , focusing on the impacts of individual policies such as carbon taxes 25 , working time reduction 26 and job guarantee programmes 27 . The three policy-mix scenarios presented in the results aim to fill this gap.The relation between environmental degradation and inequality is hardly new in the literature 20,21 .

        <p>Our scenarios compare a baseline, without the introduction of any policy, with three policy mixes: Green Growth, Policies for Social Equity, and Degrowth.

        <p>Green Growth (GG) is composed of energy policies and incentives for innovations that foster labour productivity and energy efficiency. It promotes an expansion of renewable energy sources in electricity production, and a more extensive use of electricity in final energy demand (i.e., electrification). GG also extends the current French carbon tax to imported goods, according to their incorporated carbon emissions, until e188 per ton of CO 2 in 2050.Green Growth (GG) is composed of energy policies and incentives for innovations that foster labour productivity and energy efficiency.

        <p>Policies for Social Equity (P SE) maintains the same energy policies as GG, with the exception of incentives for labour-saving technology, and adds two radical social policies: a job guarantee programme and working time reduction. The first introduces a public initiative that hires up to 300, 000 workers per year and allocates them equally between public services and environmental work that improves households' energy efficiency. The second gradually reduces weekly working hours from the current 35 to 30 within 5 years.Policies for Social Equity (P SE) maintains the same energy policies as GG, with the exception of incentives for labour-saving technology, and adds two radical social policies: a job guarantee programme and working time reduction.

        <p>Degrowth (DG) is the third policy mix and considers a reduction in consumption and exports together with all the P SE policies. While this is certainly not a policy, it allows us to assess the environmental and economic consequences of degrowth. For instance, this might reflect a change in citizens' behaviour due to increasing awareness of the environmental impacts required to sustain their standards of living 28 . Finally, DG also introduces a wealth tax to compensate for rising government deficit-to-GDP ratio as a result of decreasing national product.Degrowth (DG) is the third policy mix and considers a reduction in consumption and exports together with all the P SE policies.

        <p>Income distribution and GHG emissions. Figure 2 shows the two key indicators of environmental performance and income inequality: GHG emissions level (index 1990=100) (2a), and the Gini coefficient (2b) that ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 100% (complete inequality). The latter is calculated on the basis of 13 heterogeneous population groups defined by the three skills and four occupational statuses of the households, plus the capitalists, as listed in Figure 1.Income distribution and GHG emissions.

The latter is calculated on the basis of 13 heterogeneous population groups defined by the three skills and four occupational statuses of the households, plus the capitalists, as listed in Figure 1.</p>
        <p>The three policy-mix scenarios result in considerably greater GHG emission reductions than the baseline whose emissions approach 45% of the 1990 level in 2050. Both GG and P SE reach very similar levels of emissions by 2050 (about 23% of the 1990 level) which are close to the EU Climate Action target 29 . The DG scenario results in an even stronger reduction, down to 17.8% in 2050, due to the contraction of final consumption and energy demand. In contrast, the Gini coefficient diverges substantially among the scenarios. In the baseline, it increases by more than 1.5 points with respect to the initial year, from 32.7% to 34.3% in 2050. Under GG it hikes 2.5 points in 30 years, ending up at 35.2%. When radical social policies are introduced, the Gini coefficient sharply declines until 2050, due to a reduction in income inequality among workers.The three policy-mix scenarios result in considerably greater GHG emission reductions than the baseline whose emissions approach 45% of the 1990 level in 2050.

        <p>Under the P SE scenario the Gini coefficient drops by more than 4.5 points and stabilizes around 28% from the year 2040 onwards.

        <p>The two alternative policy mixes considered herein are at least as effective as GG in abating carbon emissions and achieve a long-lasting reduction in inequality. Moreover, the environmental and market-based incentives of GG worsen income distribution, through an increase in labour productivity that lessens the labour demand from industries. Thus, the simulation outcomes suggest that the social policies included in P SE and DG can offset unintended social consequences of green growth strategies.The two alternative policy mixes considered herein are at least as effective as GG in abating carbon emissions and achieve a long-lasting reduction in inequality.

        <p>GDP growth rates in GG and P SE converge to the same long-term values of the baseline scenario ( 1%). Under DG they fall below 0% from the year 2035 onwards, reaching -0.7% in 2050. Panel 3b shows an increase in the unemployment rates in GG and in the baseline, from an initial value around 10% up to 13% and 11.4%, respectively. By contrast, unemployment rates fall sharply in P SE and DG due to the job guarantee programme and working time reduction. By the last simulated year, these scenarios project unemployment rates of 2% and 7%, respectively.GDP growth rates in GG and P SE converge to the same long-term values of the baseline scenario ( 1%).

        <p>The positive impact on income distribution is further amplified because the fall in unemployment is followed by an expansion of the labour force participation (i.e., the share of the working age population either employed or in search of work).The positive impact on income distribution is further amplified because the fall in unemployment is followed by an expansion of the labour force participation (i.e., the share of the working age population either employed or in search of work).</p>
        <p>Panel 3c compares the dynamics of the labour share, defined as the fraction of post-tax value added paid to employed workers as wages. Once again, the GG scenario projects a trend close to that of the baseline, with declining paths that end up in the 60-65% range by 2050. P SE and DG have a positive impact on the labour share, albeit with a delay of about five years from the beginning of their implementation. In both cases, the wage share first increases until 2035, reaching a maximum of about 75.7% and 77.6% under P SE and DG, respectively, and then slightly decreases following an inverse U-shaped path.Panel 3c compares the dynamics of the labour share, defined as the fraction of post-tax value added paid to employed workers as wages.

        <p>Note that there seems to be a contradiction in comparing inequality and unemployment in P SE and DG which deserves an explanation. The wage moderation in the DG scenario improves income distribution when compared to P SE. In P SE, labour demand accelerates high-skill hourly wage gains with respect to middle-and low-skill wages due to the lower supply of high-skill workers. Therefore, although employment policies can pair higher wages with an increase in employment, partly absorbing individuals out of the labour force, low unemployment rates might lead to an increase in wage inequality among workers of different skills (with a premium for highskill workers).Note that there seems to be a contradiction in comparing inequality and unemployment in P SE and DG which deserves an explanation.

        <p>The last panel (3d) projects the simulated deficit-to-GDP ratio -the public deficit is the difference between the current government's expenditures and revenues -that measures the fiscal cost of the active labour market policies introduced in P SE and DG. All scenarios follow a decreasing trend until 2035. GG and the baseline continue on a declining path, reaching about 1.5% and 0.7% in 2050, respectively. In contrast, P SE and DG result in deficit-to-GDP ratios above the European Union's 3% limit, due to the cost of the job guarantee programme. In both of these scenarios, the ratio stays below 3% until 2040, hence below the initial level of 3.9% for more than 30 years. In DG the deficit-to-GDP ratio drastically increases after 2040. This trend is not due to a disproportionate amount of public expenditure, but rather to the contraction of the GDP (3a).The last panel (3d) projects the simulated deficit-to-GDP ratio -the public deficit is the difference between the current government's expenditures and revenues -that measures the fiscal cost of the active labour market policies introduced in P SE and DG.

        <p>The simulations suggest that both GG and P SE are equally successful in terms of curbing GHG emissions, albeit through different mechanisms. In GG, GHG emissions reductions follow directly from advances in energy efficiency, electrification and renewable energy; and indirectly from higher labour productivity that results in larger unemployment which, in turn, curtails aggregate demand and production. Under the P SE scenario, the improvement in labour market conditions leads to an increase in consumption and production. The consequent increase in emissions that should follow from this mechanism is partially offset by the increment in households' energy efficiency owing to the environmental activities of the job guarantee programme. Finally, the DG scenario curtails emissions and inequality even further through a contraction of economic activity, suggesting that decreasing economic growth does not necessarily entail catastrophic social consequences if employment and redistribution policies are in place.The simulations suggest that both GG and P SE are equally successful in terms of curbing GHG emissions, albeit through different mechanisms.

        <p>Interactions and feedback loops among economic, social and ecological dimensions constitute a complex system that can be properly analysed through computer-driven simulations. Even though this methodology might be received with certain scepticism, it is suitable for the analysis of the evolution of this system under alternative narratives. In this study, the use of simulations makes it possible to evaluate the impacts of the simultaneous implementation of multiple policies. The current analysis supports a multi-dimensional and inter-disciplinary approach to question current policy priorities in terms of social justice, environmental care and economic performance 30,31 .Interactions and feedback loops among economic, social and ecological dimensions constitute a complex system that can be properly analysed through computer-driven simulations.

        <p>The simulation results suggest that there are no winwin solutions. Each policy mix generates trade-offs. On the one hand, under the green growth scenario, the technological progress that improves environmental performance also undermines social equity. On the other hand, the policies that allow the PSE and degrowth scenarios to attain social equity with low-carbon emissions require substantial levels of public expenditure, thus leading to an increase in the deficit-to-GDP ratio. Therefore, equivalent reductions in emissions can result in radically different consequences in terms of income distribution and employment. Importantly, the green growth scenario does not improve economic performance compared with the baseline, since green investments are offset by the loss of aggregate demand due to high unemployment rates. Thus, a green growth paradox emerges: the effectiveness of GHG reductions depends on the failure to promote GDP growth.The simulation results suggest that there are no winwin solutions.

        <p>Under the PSE scenario, the boost in aggregate demand from higher employment is partially offset by the lower per-capita annual labour income due to working time reduction, resulting in a relatively low growth rate. Hence, if stronger social policies accelerated economic growth, they would limit the capacity of the system to reach environmental goals (for example, unconditional basic income). Furthermore, despite the presence of mitigating factors that limit GDP growth under the green growth and PSE scenarios, they are not able to reach the desired emissions reduction, since they only rely on energy efficiency and environmental policies for decarbonization. This supports the thesis that economic policies ought to go beyond the stimuli for technological solutions and move away from the growth imperative to achieve large-scale reductions in emissions 12 .Under the PSE scenario, the boost in aggregate demand from higher employment is partially offset by the lower per-capita annual labour income due to working time reduction, resulting in a relatively low growth rate.

        <p>Finally, both simulated social policies (that is, the job guarantee programme and working time reduction) bring about improvements in employment and distribution that are independent of growth. The scenarios are simulated by applying a system dynamics methodology that has proved to be suitable for policy analysis to evaluate low-carbon transition and social equity 35 . The main data sources considered to calibrate the initial conditions, for the French economy in the year 2014, are: Eurostat, EU-Klems, WIOD, OECD, IEA, and INSEE. Given the stochastic nature of the innovation process, as described below, we ran 500 simulations for each scenario to ensure robust results. In what follows we describe the main building blocks exposed in Figure 1 of the main text, while the Supplementary Information (chapter 1) provides the detailed description of the mathematical framework.Finally, both simulated social policies (that is, the job guarantee programme and working time reduction) bring about improvements in employment and distribution that are independent of growth.

        <p>The mechanism behind the innovation process comprises three steps (SI Figure 5): step 1. possible emergence of new available technologies, step 2. choice of the cost-minimizing technology among those available, and step 3. implementation. We define a technology (γ) as combinations of labour productivity (λ, i.e. output per worked hour) and energy efficiency (η, i.e. energy per unit of output) in each industry.The mechanism behind the innovation process comprises three steps (SI Figure 5): step 1. possible emergence of new available technologies, step 2. choice of the cost-minimizing technology among those available, and step 3. implementation.

        <p>In each period industry-specific innovations might emerge (step 1.) affecting either λ or η, or both. Hence, there are four possible alternative new technologies (SI table 8). γ 1 corresponds to the previous-period (old) technology that keeps λ and η unchanged. It is always available for all industries. Technology γ 2 is labour-saving (i.e., λ increases) but energy-augmenting (i.e., η decreases), while γ 3 has the opposite effect: λ decreases and η increases. Finally, γ 4 improves both labour productivity and energy efficiency and is always chosen if available. We consider recent evidence about the impact of relative input prices -of energy and labour in our case -as drivers of R&amp;D investment decisions 36 . It is assumed that the ratio between the growth rates of labour and energy costs affects the probability of emergence of new technologies. For instance, a relative increase in labour with respect to energy costs results in a higher probability of γ 2 that becomes available more often than γ 3 .In each period industry-specific innovations might emerge (step 1.) affecting either λ or η, or both.

Technology γ 2 is labour-saving (i.e., λ increases) but energy-augmenting (i.e., η decreases), while γ 3 has the opposite effect: λ decreases and η increases. Finally, γ 4 improves both labour productivity and energy efficiency and is always chosen if available. We consider recent evidence about the impact of relative input prices -of energy and labour in our case -as drivers of R&amp;D investment decisions 36 . It is assumed that the ratio between the growth rates of labour and energy costs affects the probability of emergence of new technologies. For instance, a relative increase in labour with respect to energy costs results in a higher probability of γ 2 that becomes available more often than γ 3 .</p>
        <p>In step 2 each industry chooses the cost-minimizing technology among those available after step 1. This choice is endogenous because it depends on the growth rates of labour and energy costs of an industry, and on the industry's relative demand for labour and energy. An increasing trend in labour with respect to the energy costs will lead the industry to opt for labour-saving technologies more often, when available. The pace of the implementation of new technologies in step 3 depends on investments. The values of labour productivity (λ) and energy efficiency (η) are given by a weighted average of the λ and η from new and old technologies. The weights are investments and capital stock after depreciation, respectively. Hence, new technologies are implemented in proportion to the renovation of fixed capital.In step 2 each industry chooses the cost-minimizing technology among those available after step 1.

        <p>Energy and Emissions Energy demand from industries and households is distributed among four energy sources: gas, oil, coal and electricity. The latter is produced by a mix of fossil fuels, renewable sources and nuclear power.

The tax increases by about e8 per ton of CO 2 per year until 2020, reaching e56, and by e4.4 per year afterwards to achieve the planned e100 per ton in 2030. The carbon tax is not applied to those industries participating in the European Emissions Trading System, which accounted for about a third of total French GHG emissions in 2014 (145Mtoe out of 435Mtoe).The model considers a carbon tax as recently introduced in France, starting from e7 per ton of CO 2 in 2014.

        <p>Additionally, households hold stocks of different assets and receive a financial income from interest, dividends and asset price variations. Low-skill households hold all their assets in deposits, which pay no interest. Middle-skill ones hold deposits and government bonds that pay interest, while high-skill households and capitalists distribute their savings among deposits, bonds and equities. The latter pay dividends from company profits. Households pay a progressive income tax, a flat tax which combines social security contributions (i.e., contribution sociale généralisée with the contribution au remboursement de la dette sociale), and a 30% tax levied on financial income.Additionally, households hold stocks of different assets and receive a financial income from interest, dividends and asset price variations.

        <p>Consumption depends directly on disposable income and wealth multiplied by fixed, skillspecific, marginal propensities to consume out-of-income and out-of-wealth. The composition of the consumption bundle is given by fixed shares, calculated from final consumption spent in each industry in France in 2014. An exception to these fixed shares is introduced in energy consumption which falls, in monetary terms, whenever households become more energy-efficient. In other words, household expenditure for energy services -such as illumination or transportation -falls if new technologies increase energy efficiency (i.e., γ 3 and γ 4 ). The subsequent savings are allocated to the remaining industries. This mechanism reproduces an energy-related rebound effect, also known as Jevon's paradox 42 , in which the direct effects of energy efficiency may be offset by an increase in demand for energy-intensive goods and services.Consumption depends directly on disposable income and wealth multiplied by fixed, skillspecific, marginal propensities to consume out-of-income and out-of-wealth.

        <p>New Production Revolution In order to assess at an aggregate scale the effects of the strategies to boost technological progress, we introduce a policy here termed 'New Production Revolution' (N P R) 43 . It is composed by incentives to automation or high labour productivity (HLP ) and to high energy efficiency (HEEF ). We set increased probabilities of emergence for new labour-(γ 2 ) and energy-saving (γ 3 ) technologies under HLP and HEEF , respectively. Thus, N P R allows for faster technological progress to assess its impact on employment, emissions and income distribution.New Production Revolution In order to assess at an aggregate scale the effects of the strategies to boost technological progress, we introduce a policy here termed 'New Production Revolution' (N P R) 43 .

        <p>Border Carbon Adjustment Following a proposal by the French President Emmanuel Macron during the COP21 held in Paris in 2015, a policy termed Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA) imposes the same carbon tax rates described above upon imports, according to their incorporated GHG content.

        <p>Working Time Reduction This social policy consists in a curtailment of weekly working hours, from the current 35 44 to a 30-hour working week within five years. In the last decade, working time reduction has been considered "a multiple dividend policy" 45 capable of improving income distribution and reducing emissions due to scale and composition effects 46 . Workers earn and consume less (scale), while time availability allows them to choose less energy-intensive consumption baskets (composition). Nevertheless, at the macroeconomic level, in an economy with idle resources, newly hired workers earn and consume more which could offset the environmental benefits of reducing working hours of those initially employed. Since consumption baskets are fixed in our model, the simulated W T R policy captures only the scale effect.Working Time Reduction This social policy consists in a curtailment of weekly working hours, from the current 35 44 to a 30-hour working week within five years.

        <p>We have opted for the development of a country-scale model since national governments are the main agents of environmental and labour market policies. Hence, unlike global-scale integrated assessment models, our approach does not consider negative feedback effects from climate change on the economy. Considering these in EUROGREEN would require ad-hoc assumptions on the behavior of global emissions. Moreover, our national model does not properly consider binding institutional constraints defined by the EU and financial interconnections between France and other EU members.
