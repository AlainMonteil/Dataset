        <p>The exponential increase in worldwide plastic production currently translates to an annual production of nearly 400 million metric tons. 1 Combined with a poor waste management system this results in an estimated 4.8 -12.7 million metric tons of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. 2 Due to physical, chemical and biological processes, such as fragmentation and photodegradation, this plastic debris breaks down into small particles. 3 Microplastics are those plastic particles that are smaller than 5 mm but larger than 1 µm. They are proven to be ubiquitous pollutants within the marine environment and predominantly (94 -99 %) accumulate on the seafloor. [4][5][6] Phenomena such as biofouling and marine snow are reported to be large contributors to the latter. [7][8][9] To date, predictions estimate that the global average concentration of microplastics in intertidal sediments is 32 -144 particles kg -1 and about 1.5 -6.7 particles kg -1 in deep sea sediments. 10 Considering that microplastics have been found in the digestive tract of over 300 different marine species, their environmental impact is of major concern worldwide. 11 Next to severe blockage of feeding appendages, chemical leaching of potentially harmful additives may contribute to the detrimental effects of marine microplastic pollution. 12 In addition, by contaminating the human food chain, considerable microplastic exposure can pose a threat to human food safety. However, at present, the associated risks are only marginally understood. 13 It was during the last decade that scientific interest led to a large number of publications analyzing the abundance, occurrence, sources and impact of microplastics. [14][15][16] However, there is hardly any literature related to the remediation of these marine pollutants. Given the growing concern related to the microplastic pollution across the globe, research into the remediation of microplastics is imperative. Considering that seafloor sediment represents the most important sink for marine microplastics, separation techniques that can remove microplastics from sediment mixtures are particularly valuable in this context. Typically, one could consider 3 separation factors for a mixture of microplastics and sediment: size, density and polarity (Table 1). With respect to particle size, there is a significant overlap to be expected between sediment and microplastic particles. As stated before, microplastics are defined between 1 µm and 5 mm. Marine sediment particles vary greatly in size depending on their geographic location, yet they are mostly allocated to either the mud fraction or the sand fraction. 17 The mud fraction involves particles smaller than 63 µm, while the sand fraction consists of particles between 63 µm and 2 mm. 18 This implies that particle size is not a good separation factor in this context. Regarding density, sediment is generally characterized by a density of 2650 kg m -3 , while the density of the most common plastic types, namely high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS), 1,19 rarely exceeds 1400 kg m -3 . Furthermore, sediment is typically considered as hydrophilic, 20,21 while the polarity of plastics predominantly suggests (near) hydrophobic behavior. 22,23 As a result, sedimentation and (air) flotation techniques 3 appear to be promising remediation techniques since they involve density and/or polarity as their primary separation factor(s). 24 Table 1: Characterization of sediment and microplastics with respect to 3 typical separation factors: size, density and polarity.

        <p>Seven different plastic product types were chosen based on their frequency of occurrence, their main plastic type and their physical structure to account for the wide variety of plastic litter found in the marine environment: beverage bottles composed of PET, cleansing-liquid bottles composed of HDPE, flowerpots composed of PP, food containers composed of PS, beverage shrink wrap composed of PE, food packages composed of PE and pieces of broken construction pipes composed of PVC (Table 2). After cleaning and washing the plastic items with deionized water, each product type was shredded separately. For the two film product types, namely the beverage shrink wrap and the food packages, a Hellweg Granulator (340/150) was used in combination with liquid nitrogen to reduce the film's flexibility. The other product types were milled using a Shini Granulator (16N/20N) with the exception of the broken construction pipes which were manipulated with a traditional miter saw to 6 produce fibers. All generated plastic particles were sieved by using an Endecott Sieve Shaker to target the microplastic size range (from 1 µm to 5 mm). Subsequently, 20 particles were selected per product type, which rendered a total of 140 different microplastic particles. from the measurements of particles originating from the same products yet of greater mass (i.e. &gt; 0.1 g) due to accuracy limitations.

            <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>, various common shape descriptors were calculated. The longest, intermediate and shortest principal axis of the best-fit ellipsoid as defined by Kumar et al. (2010) 39 are often an intrinsic part of a particle's shape analysis and are typically used to derive several shape descriptors. These principal axes were obtained by combining the measurements of a Mitutoyo Digimatic Indicator with the data gathered 7 from the 2D-image analysis to attain three-dimensional information.

        <p>Measuring sinking rates of typical microplastics. To measure the terminal sinking velocity u t (m s -1 ) of the microplastic particles, a traditional cylindrical settling column of 45 cm height and 10 cm in diameter was used. Depending on the density of the particle, deionized water (density ρ f = 1000 kg m -3 ) or ethanol (density ρ f = 790 kg m -3 ) was used as settling medium. The sinking experiments were performed in a temperature-controlled room to avoid fluctuations in viscosity of the medium between measurements. Prior to the sinking velocity measurements, the microplastic particles were submerged in a beaker filled with the corresponding medium at the same temperature to avoid electrostatic discharge at the surface of the particles. 28 The latter might affect the sinking behavior of plastic particles, which is undesirable during the experiments. After submersion in the beaker, the particles were individually transferred to the top of the settling column and gently released in the fluid by using tweezers. Time recording started 20 cm below the surface of the medium to ensure that the particle reached its terminal velocity. More specifically, the time a particle needed to cross a distance of two times 10 cm was measured by means of an HDR Camera at 100 frames per second. Since the particles were not expected to be smaller than 0.5 mm, the use of backlit-imaging was deemed unnecessary. Given the measured sinking time and the predefined travelled distance, the terminal sinking velocity of each individual particle was calculated.Measuring sinking rates of typical microplastics.

Hydrodynamic drag is an important parameter affecting the sinking behavior of particles moving in a liquid. 41 The dimensionless drag coefficient C D is used to quantify this drag force. For spherical particles, well-defined relationships have been derived linking the drag coefficient with the particle Reynolds number. 34,42 However, for non-spherical particles the drag coefficient depends on both the particle Reynolds number and the particle shape. The dimensionless particle Reynolds number Re p is a function of fluid properties (i.e. density and viscosity), the particle diameter and the terminal settling velocity of the particle, and provides information about the flow regime.Evaluation of shape-dependent drag models.

        <p>Particle shape is a parameter that is more difficult to quantify. As previously discussed, dimensionless shape descriptors are used for this purpose. To determine which (combination of) shape descriptor(s) describes the effect of particle shape on the sinking behavior of microplastics most accurately, 11 different drag models were compared and evaluated based on our dataset (Table 3). The following 7 shape descriptors are used in these drag models: circularity χ, sphericity Φ, Corey Shape Factor CSF, Powers Index P, particle aspect ratio ϕ, 9 particle flatness F and particle elongation e. More information on these shape descriptors can be found in SI2 of the Supporting Information and is available in the corresponding reference (Table 3). Each drag model is empirically derived for a particular range of particle Reynolds numbers (Table 3). In order to experimentally compare and evaluate the different drag models, the average error AE (%) and the root mean squared error RMSE (%) were calculated as measures of fit for the different drag models.

        <p>Measuring contact angles of plastic sheets subjected to biofouling. The contact angle θ (°) of a solid surface provides a measure of polarity. It is the angle formed by the intersection of the liquid-solid interface and the liquid-vapor interface when a liquid droplet rests on a solid surface. In case the water contact angle is less than 90°, the solid surface is said to be hydrophilic, while a water contact angle greater than 90°indicates a hydrophobic surface. In other words, low contact angles are observed when the liquid spreads on the surface, while large contact angles are observed when the liquid minimizes its contact with the surface and forms a compact droplet.Measuring contact angles of plastic sheets subjected to biofouling.

        <p>To investigate the effect of marine biofouling on the polarity of different plastic types, six of the most common plastic types were selected: HDPE, LDPE, PP, PVC, PET and PS. 1,19 Corresponding pellets were extruded to form long sheets of plastic, which were subsequently cut to produce 10 sheets of 2 by 4 cm for each plastic type. In addition, six different plastic consumer products composed of PP were added to the experiments to examine the effect of additives such as colorants. To induce biofouling, the plastic sheets and consumer products were fixated in a tank filled with seawater. To that end, the sheets were perforated with a soldering iron to allow strapping with thin wires. The plastic sheets with a density greater than the density of seawater were fixated at the top, while the plastic sheets with a lower density were fixated at the bottom of the tank. This was realized by means of water-resistant wires and sand-filled weights. The consumer products composed of PP were analogously perforated and held underwater.

The volume-equivalent sphere diameter d p of the microplastics used in the sinking experiments ranged between 0.63 and 3.48 mm ( The terminal sinking velocities of the microplastics were consistently lower than predicted by the reference law for spheres by Dietrich (1982) 40 (Table 4). On average, the theoretically predicted values were 3 to 4 times greater than the measured values. The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that typical microplastics, as used in the sinking experiments, are not spherical. This clearly conflicts with the assumptions made in the reference law. Hence, particle shape is an important parameter strongly affecting the sinking behavior of typical microplastics. In particular, the sinking velocities of film and fibrous microplastics (i.e. the PE and PVC microplastics (Table 2), respectively, in this study, represented by the beverage shrink wrap, food packages and construction pipe pieces) are significantly suppressed by their shape considering that they deviate 3 to 7 times from the theoretical predictions for spheres.Sinking behavior of typical microplastics.

Two plots are provided with T b versus d p (i.e. particle diameter) for a spherical microplastic particle (left) and T b versus l p (i.e. flattened cube side) for a thin film microplastic particle with a fixed thickness h p = 40 µm (right). Biofilm thickness values that are assumed to be realistic are highlighted in green, while biofilm thickness values that are assumed to be unlikely to occur in the marine environment are highlighted in red.</p>
        <p>depends, among others, on medium composition, substrate nature, present microbial strains and physicochemical properties of the surrounding seawater. 56 For instance, the rate of biofouling is typically higher close to the shore and decreases with increasing depth, while temperature and seasonal changes affect the composition of the corresponding biofilm. 56 In addition, biofilm thickness is generally not homogenous. However, based on existing literature, it is assumed that an average marine biofilm has a thickness ranging from roughly 1 to 500 µm. [56][57][58][59][60] This suggests that spherical microplastics with density ρ p = 925 kg m -3 and a diameter d p larger than approximately 600 µm are unlikely to reach an average biofouled density of 1025 kg m -3 as a direct result of marine biofouling. To illustrate, common plastic resin pellets are typically 1 to 5 mm in diameter. However, it is found that small microplastics (i.e. &lt; 1 mm) represent an important fraction (i.e. 35 to 90 %) of all marine microplastics. [61][62][63][64][65] Furthermore, it appears that biofouling is able to increase the average bio-fouled density of all film microplastic particles with a thickness of 40 µm and a density of 925 kg m -3 to where it reaches the density of the surrounding seawater, which is assumed to be 1025 kg m -3 . In addition, many rigid plastic applications such as trays and bottles 24 generate primarily film-alike microplastics (i.e. the longitudinal axis is significantly greater than the thickness axis). These findings potentially explain why more than 90 % of marine microplastics accumulate on the seabed 5,6 despite the fact that approximately 60 % of the total worldwide plastic production is associated with plastic types having a density smaller than 1025 kg m -3 . 1 Yet other processes such as the phenomenon of marine snow can also contribute to the sinking behavior of floating microplastics 9 but are less relevant to consider in the case of remediation. Furthermore, biofouling could induce bioflocculation, which in turn may affect the sinking behavior by increasing particle size or altering particle density among other factors. 66 Experiments to confirm this hypothesis could be interesting for future research.depends, among others, on medium composition, substrate nature, present microbial strains and physicochemical properties of the surrounding seawater. 56 For instance, the rate of biofouling is typically higher close to the shore and decreases with increasing depth, while temperature and seasonal changes affect the composition of the corresponding biofilm. 56 In addition, biofilm thickness is generally not homogenous.

        <p>Polarity of marine plastics. Contact angle measurements of the blanco plastic sheets lie within the range of 70 to 100 °(Table 7), which is in accordance with existing literature. 22,23,67,68 This indicates that the polarity of plastic is situated near the boundary point between hydrophilic (i.e. water contact angle &lt; 90 °) and hydrophobic (i.e. water contact angle &gt; 90 °) behavior. The water contact angles of the six different blanco PP consumer products were very similar yet significantly lower compared to the pure PP sheets, namely on average 81 °for the consumer products versus 96 °for the sheets. This suggests that additives such as colorants or surface treatments such as printing inks have a tendency to make the surface of a plastic product more hydrophilic. The bio-fouled plastic surfaces displayed a consistent and significant drop in water contact angle towards values between 30 and 40 °499 (Table 7). It also appears that the contact angle of bio-fouled plastic sheets is independent of the plastic type (Table 7). The water contact angles of the bio-fouled PP consumer products were again very similar with an average of 34 °, which lies within the range of the bio-fouled PP plastic sheets. Hence, the addition of additives such as colorants appears to have little effect on the contact angle of bio-fouled plastics. Therefore, it is expected that biofouling will cause microplastics to exhibit an increased hydrophilic behavior and thus more difficult to separate from a sediment mixture. 25 Implications for remediation of microplastics. Our findings regarding the sinking behavior of typical microplastics contain fundamental information to predict the performance of potential remediation techniques for microplastics. In particular, the identified best-performing drag model may be used to quantitatively estimate the recovery rate of microplastics and compare it to the recovery rate of sediment particles in a sedimentation technique such as centrifugal separation. Typically, particles are assumed to be spherical when evaluating such solid-liquid separation techniques since characterizing particle shape is often time-consuming and/or the impact on the separation performance is assumed to be negligible. However, here we highlight the importance of including a measure of particle shape when evaluating sedimentation techniques for the remediation of microplastics.Polarity of marine plastics.

        <p>Analysis of marine biofouling on the surface of plastics indicated that bio-fouled microplastics will become more hydrophilic compared to unfouled microplastics. Hence, it is found that biofouling closes the difference in polarity between sediment and microplastic particles. Froth flotation techniques make use of the difference in polarity between solids to separate the most hydrophobic particles from the mixture in a froth layer by selectively adhering air bubbles to the surface of the particles. Consequently, (froth) flotation techniques become less attractive as potential remediation techniques when dealing with bio-fouled microplastics, unless the installation provides a sufficient amount of friction to (partly) detach the corresponding biofilms from the surface of the bio-fouled microplastics. The latter is expected to occur during the pumping stage of the sediment mixture (as part of the remediation process) due to the rather low adhesion of the biofilms to the plastic surfaces experienced during the biofouling experiments. Nevertheless, the degree of biofilm-detachment associated with marine sediments polluted with (micro)plastics requires further research.Analysis of marine biofouling on the surface of plastics indicated that bio-fouled microplastics will become more hydrophilic compared to unfouled microplastics.

        <p>In summary, centrifugal separation and (froth) flotation appear to be promising remediation techniques for the removal of microplastics from marine sediments, taking into account the aforementioned complexity with respect to particle shape and biofouling. The effect of particle shape on the remediation process can be evaluated using the drag model of Dioguardi As a result, biofouling diminishes the difference in density between microplastics and sediment particles, which is particularly unfavorable for centrifugal separation as remediation technique, and closes the difference in polarity between microplastics and sediment particles, which is particularly unfavorable for (froth) flotation as remediation technique. Hence, the development of a large-scale sediment remediation technique for microplastics will prove to 27 be challenging. However, considering the undeniable benefit such a technique can bring to our environment on a global scale, this study seeks to drive research into the remediation of microplastics by sharing scientific reflections dedicated to this matter.In summary, centrifugal separation and (froth) flotation appear to be promising remediation techniques for the removal of microplastics from marine sediments, taking into account the aforementioned complexity with respect to particle shape and biofouling.

        <p>First, the sinking behavior of typical microplastics originating from real plastic waste samples was analyzed, including films in particular. This confirmed the importance of particle shape and identified appropriate shape descriptors to quantitatively characterize the most frequently occurring microplastic shapes. We found that the terminal sinking velocity of typical microplastics is on average 3 to 4 times smaller than predicted by the reference law for spheres, and up to 7 times smaller for fibrous microplastics particularly. Circularity is found to be an appropriate shape descriptor to distinguish fibrous microplastics from non-fibrous microplastics and sphericity is found to be an appropriate shape descriptor to distinguish film microplastics from non-film microplastics. In general, sphericity (as defined in this study) appears to be a recommended shape descriptor to include in the shape characterization of typical microplastics.First, the sinking behavior of typical microplastics originating from real plastic waste samples was analyzed, including films in particular.
