        <p>State-of-the-art machine-vision systems have limitations associated with crack width measurements. The sample points used to describe the crack width are often subjectively defined by experimenters, which obscures the crack width ground truth. Consequently, in most related studies, the uncontrollable system errors of vision modules result in unsatisfactory measurement accuracy. In this study, the cracks of a reservoir dam are taken as objects, and a new crack backbone refinement algorithm and width-measurement scheme are proposed. The algorithm simplifies the redundant data in the crack image and improves the efficiency of crack-shape estimation. Further, an effective definition of crack width is proposed that combines the macroscale and microscale characteristics of the backbone to obtain accurate and objective sample points for width description. Compared with classic methods, the average simplification rate of the crack backbone and the average error rate of direction judgment are all improved. The results of a series of experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method by showing that it can improve detection automation and has potential engineering application.State-of-the-art machine-vision systems have limitations associated with crack width measurements.

        <p>For the crack backbone extraction algorithm, we set the reduction rate test to illustrate the 345 performance of the algorithm when reducing the amount of data. To measure the performance of 346 the direction determination method, we used the two evaluation criteria proposed in this study: the 347 recall rate of the direction determination and the direction error, and the corresponding judgment 348 method. A segmentation performance evaluation test and a width-vision measurement accuracy 349 test were conducted. For the ground truth, we referred to the experiment in Section 4. To evaluate the segmentation effect of U-Net, the crack segmentation effects of the common 368 semantic segmentation networks, 
            <rs type="software">SegNet</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">DeeplabV3+</rs> (with Xception and MobileNetv2 as 369 the backbone networks, respectively), were added for comparison. The distributions of their 370 performance evaluation scores are shown in Fig. 11, while visual comparisons are presented in Fig. 371 12. The abscissa is the order of the graph, and the ordinate is the score. The results show that U-Net has higher segmentation accuracy and stability in the task of 390 would be worthwhile. Consequently, U-Net segmentation results were directly used for 392 subsequent width measurement in this study. 393

        <p>As shown in Fig. 13 and Table 2, the skeleton obtained by the crack backbone extraction 409 algorithm had an average simplification rate of 6.40 % compared with the skeleton obtained using 410 the Zhang-Suen image-refinement algorithm. On the one hand, it showed that the skeleton 411 obtained by the Zhang-Suen image thinning algorithm was universally spaced for further 412 optimization. On the other hand, the measurement direction determination method in this paper 413 was related to the eight-neighborhood pixel distribution of the backbone points, and the 414 streamlining of the skeleton was conducive to the improvement of the matching degree of the 415 macro-and micro-scale measurement direction information of the backbone. Thus, the 416 streamlining performance was good. In addition, it is worth emphasizing that the crack backbone 417 extraction algorithm proposed in this study had no more than two neighboring points for each 418 backbone point, greatly reducing the number of backbone point neighborhood distribution types to 419 only 16, which was convenient for classifying backbone points according to neighborhood 420 distribution types. 421As shown in Fig. 13 and Table 2, the skeleton obtained by the crack backbone extraction 409 algorithm had an average simplification rate of 6.40 % compared with the skeleton obtained using 410 the Zhang-Suen image-refinement algorithm.

        <p>The recall rate of the direction determination method refers to the ratio of the total length of 423 each segment of cracks that can be visually measured in the width to the total length of the cracks 424 in the image, which is used to investigate the recall performance of the measurement algorithm on 425 the task of crack width measurement. On the other hand, the recall rate can also reflect the 426 matching degree between the macro-and micro-scale information of the crack's backbone in the 427 measurement direction determination problem in this method, because the backbone points of the 428 macro-and micro-scale mismatch were the negative sample in the recall statistics. Number of 429 pixels was used to approximate the length of the crack section. Using the direction determination 430 method proposed in this study, the total number of measurable points, C P , was obtained, and the 431 total number of crack main points, S P , was counted. The recall rate, R , is given by Eq. (15): The recall test results are shown in Fig. 14, where the red label represents the proposed method 439 and the blue label represents the control group. The statistical results are listed in Table 3, where 440 the label "Improved" represents the proposed method. The results show that the average recall rate 441 of the proposed width-measurement direction determination method is approximately 74.90 %, 442 and a standard deviation of 4 % indicated that the measurement was stable. They all outperformed 443 the control group; the full-search performance was good overall. At the same time, the results 444 show that the macro and micro information of the backbone points in the measurement direction 445 determination problem were well matched, so that averaging three-quarters of the crack sections 446 can make a more accurate measurement. More accurate here means that measurements with 447 directions as a guide were theoretically more accurate than the measurement method which did not 448 distinguish between measurement directions. 449The recall rate of the direction determination method refers to the ratio of the total length of 423 each segment of cracks that can be visually measured in the width to the total length of the cracks 424 in the image, which is used to investigate the recall performance of the measurement algorithm on 425 the task of crack width measurement.

We randomly selected 457 10 backbone points, mi P , from the measurable points, and their positions were recorded and 458 marked on the image. We invited three technicians to determine the measurement direction of the 459 crack at the position marked on the image based on their experience, taking the tangential 460 direction of the crack-growth direction as the measurement direction. Hence, pixel points A and B 461 were selected on the two edges of the crack, and the mark point, m P , had to be on the line 462 section AB or as close to it as possible. 463The direction error was used to evaluate the accuracy of the direction.

A digital vernier caliper with an accuracy of 0.01 mm was used to measure the crack 519 width on site for comparison data. The proposed algorithm for determining the measurement 520 direction was used to obtain the measurable points in the crack. Then, five of the measurable 521 points were randomly selected for width measurement, and the measurement position was marked 522 in the real-time image of the left camera. Subsequently, the digital display vernier caliper was used 523 to measure the inner diameter of the crack to obtain the standard value of its width at that location, 524 In Fig. 19 and Table 6, the results show that the average error of this test was approximately 542 0.32 mm, and the average variance was 0.19 mm. This demonstrates that the visual measurement 543 test results in this study are close to those of commonly used methods in engineering, which 544 indicates that the proposed method can be utilized in engineering applications. 545 546The main equipment included two MV-EM510C industrial cameras (resolution 2,456 × 2,058), the 516 focal length of the lens was 8 mm, and the distance between the camera lens and the dam surface 517 was approximately 240 mm.

        <p>This study proposed a practical and complete visual method for measuring crack width using 548 a real dam as the research object. The effectiveness of U-Net in the task of crack segmentation 549 was first verified. Then, to address the problem of data redundancy in the crack skeleton, this 550 study designed a more streamlined and stable crack backbone extraction method. The total number 551 of eight-neighborhood points of each point on the backbone did not exceed two, which reduced 552 the amount of backbone data and the distribution types of the eight neighborhoods of backbone 553 The biggest difference between the crack backbone in this paper and the skeleton extracted by other algorithms is that the crack backbone does not contain small branches, which can be used to express the fracture growth characteristics with more severe cracking. This is because, compared to the small crack branches, the crack backbone with a larger degree of cracking is more worthy of attention.This study proposed a practical and complete visual method for measuring crack width using 548 a real dam as the research object.

        <p>Secondly, only the main crack was considered to make the extracted crack backbone more convenient to serve the width visual measurement, while avoiding the situation that the measurement direction is not unique in the same location. Simplifying the backbone to a single pixel structure is also an element of this research. The simplification rate can be quantified to show that it is meaningful to further study the crack backbone refinement from the general refinement algorithm. This is because after the refinement algorithm, on average, 6.4% of the pixels can still be refined further. The difference between the proposed crack backbone extraction algorithm and other existing algorithms has been added in line 155-158 and line 212-223. A description of the simplification rate has been supplemented in lines 407-416.Secondly, only the main crack was considered to make the extracted crack backbone more convenient to serve the width visual measurement, while avoiding the situation that the measurement direction is not unique in the same location.

        <p>Recall refers to the proportion of pixels on the backbone that can be used to judge the measurement direction. Recall statistics were based on pixels and were used to express the proportion of cracks that can be measured in the entire section, rather than the proportion of crack samples that were not successfully measured to the total sample. The remaining average 25% of the failure cases abandoned the measurement due to a mismatch between the two-scale features. Because the wrong measurement direction did not lead to the correct measurement results, abandoning these positions increased the credibility of the measurement results. Random sampling was done at a measurable location. The procedure did not contain points where the direction of the measurement could not be judged. The purpose of random sampling for measurement was to compare the error between the visual measurement and the actual manual measurement, and the identity case in this section was counted by the measurement direction error and the numerical error of the measurement result. Supplemented on lines 421-424 and 433-444. 6.

        <p>Among them, morphological processing here refers to dilation or erosion algorithms (they had opposite effects to each other), whose role is to expand the binarized target towards the background. The role of blur is also to expand the target, but its effect is more moderate than that of morphological processing. 3. The authors consider both a macro-scale and a micro-scale basis for determining the slope of the "backbone" and hence the direction for determining crack width. They should provide a clear explanation of why both scales need to be considered. The significance of the macro-scale basis is fairly clear, given their approach to fitting a polynomial to the backbone and computing its first derivative. The significance of the micro-scale basis is, however, not obvious. In addition, the authors state that then the macroscale and micro-scale produce different values for the angles phi and psi, then measurement at the given point is abandoned. The authors should explain what this situation corresponds to in physical terms, perhaps giving some examples of real images.Among them, morphological processing here refers to dilation or erosion algorithms (they had opposite effects to each other), whose role is to expand the binarized target towards the background.

        <p>Macroscopic scale information is obtained using n-degree polynomials for curve fitting, and the result was a smooth curve, while the crack backbone in the natural state was not a smooth curve, as shown in the newly added Fig. 7. On the other hand, at the microscopic scale, only three pixels are used as the basis for directional judgment, which was also not enough to accurately express the growth state of the crack at that place. Therefore, the design method of this paper used the two-scale information fusion as the basis for judging the measurement direction. In this method, there were multiple neighborhood distribution types corresponding to one direction in the microscopic scale information, which was equivalent to adding microscale constraints to the macroscale information, thereby reducing the probability of incorrectly judging the crack width and improving the reliability of the measurement. In the blue circle of Fig. 7, manual measurement should be carried out in the 45° direction. However, as shown in the red circle, if microscale information has been used for the measurement, it was measured in the vertical direction. Similarly, in the green circle, the vertical direction should be followed for the manual measurement. However, as shown in the yellow circle, if macroscale information has been used to measure, it was still measured in the 45° direction. In fact, using only the macroscopic or microscopic scale information of the backbone for direction judgment may cause a large direction judgment error.Macroscopic scale information is obtained using n-degree polynomials for curve fitting, and the result was a smooth curve, while the crack backbone in the natural state was not a smooth curve, as shown in the newly added Fig. 7.

        <p>In this method, there are multiple neighborhood distribution types corresponding to one direction in the microscopic scale information, which is equivalent to adding microscale constraints to the macroscale information, thereby reducing the probability of incorrectly judging the crack width and improving the reliability of the measurement. In fact, using only the macro-or micro-scale information of the backbone for direction judgment may cause a large direction judgment error. Macroscale information is obtained using n-degree polynomials for curve fitting, and the result is a smooth curve, while the crack backbone in the natural state is not a smooth curve, as shown in the newly added Fig. 7. On the other hand, at the microscopic scale, only three pixels are used as the basis for directional judgment, which is also not enough to accurately express the growth state of the crack at that place. Therefore, the design method of this paper uses the two-scale information fusion as the basis for judging the measurement direction.In this method, there are multiple neighborhood distribution types corresponding to one direction in the microscopic scale information, which is equivalent to adding microscale constraints to the macroscale information, thereby reducing the probability of incorrectly judging the crack width and improving the reliability of the measurement.
