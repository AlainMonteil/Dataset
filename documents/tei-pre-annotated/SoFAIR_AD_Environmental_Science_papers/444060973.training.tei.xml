        <p>Polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), are currently produced, used and discarded at the highest rate of all plastics, thereby accounting for over half of all plastic waste 2,3 . In order to overcome the problem of such large quantities of plastic waste, researchers have studied various ways to convert these waste polymers into value-added products such as hydrocarbon fuels and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) etc. [4][5][6][7] .Polyolefins such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS), are currently produced, used and discarded at the highest rate of all plastics, thereby accounting for over half of all plastic waste 2,3 .

        <p>Over the past decade there has been increasing interests and research into the conversion of plastic waste into synthetic oil mixtures 5,6,8,9 and great efforts have been made to improve the energy efficiency and to exert precise control over the resulting products 9 . Gasification of plastic waste 7,10,11 is one such approach to produce a stream of synthesis gas for energy or synthesis purposes 2,7 . More recently, researchers have focussed on producing hydrogen as the main product from plastic waste as an alternative renewable process since plastic materials represent hydrogen-rich energy feedstocks which contain between some 8 -14 wt.% of hydrogen [12][13][14][15][16][17] . Czernik et al. 15 and others [12][13][14][15][16][18][19][20][21][22] have proposed an important two-step process to thermally decompose plastics to produce hydrogen-rich gases. In this two-step process (idealised in Fig. 1a), plastic polymers are first decomposed into a mixture of small hydrocarbons via pyrolysis at high temperature, followed by catalytic steam reforming (&gt; 750 °C) of the pyrolysis gases and vapours for syngas production (H2 + CO) 15,18 . This represents an important advance but there is, inevitably, a significant energy input required for the two reaction steps and the problem of large volumes of CO2 which are also produced (∼12 kg CO2 per 1 kg H2 production) 17 , Moreover, the pyrolysis-reforming two-step process, by its very nature, of course, is invariably complicated.Over the past decade there has been increasing interests and research into the conversion of plastic waste into synthetic oil mixtures 5,6,8,9 and great efforts have been made to improve the energy efficiency and to exert precise control over the resulting products 9 .

        <p>Here, we illustrate, a simple and rapid one-step process for the deconstruction of plastic waste (Fig. 1b). This involves the microwave-initiated, solid-solid reaction; whereby a mixture of mechanically pulverised plastics (1 mm -5 mm) are mixed with an additive catalyst (microwave-susceptor) composite of iron oxide and aluminium oxide and subjected to microwave treatment. A schematic experimental configuration is given in Fig. 1c. Widely used plastic waste comprised milk containers (high density polyethylene, HDPE), food wraps (polypropylene, PP) and plastic foam (polystyrene, PS) used in this study were collected from commercial materials used by large supermarket chains. Following the microwave initiation, a large volume of H2 gas is rapidly evolved arising from the deconstruction of mechanical mixture of plastics and microwave receptors (catalysts) (Fig. 1d and Movie 1). H2 levels in the evolved gas stream can reach nearly 90 vol.% with a H2 yield of 55. 6 ) leaving only a residue of carbonaceous materials, the bulk of which are identified as carbon nanotubes.Here, we illustrate, a simple and rapid one-step process for the deconstruction of plastic waste (Fig. 1b).

        <p>The nomenclature FeAlOx refers in this paper to the catalyst that was prepared by a citric acid combustion method (see Methods for full details), with a molar ratio of Fe:Al:citric acid = 1:1:1, unless otherwise noted. We define as Selectivity, the measured volume % of the product composition in the evolved gases obtained from GC analysis. The mass of each gas products was calculated according to the measured volume of gases obtained and the composition analysis from GC. The yield of gas, liquid and solid are therefore determined as their respective mass fractions in relation to the total weight of plastic. We describe the H2 yield as the moles of H2 obtained divided by the total weight of plastic. The Hydrogen Efficiency is determined as the total mass of hydrogen contained in all gas products as compared to the theoretical amount of hydrogen contained in the plastic (See Eq. 1-5 in the Methods section).The nomenclature FeAlOx refers in this paper to the catalyst that was prepared by a citric acid combustion method (see Methods for full details), with a molar ratio of Fe:Al:citric acid = 1:1:1, unless otherwise noted.

        <p>The data for a representative 'time-on-stream' experiment for the microwaveinitiated dehydrogenation of mechanically-pulverised HDPE (in this case, waste milk containers) using the FeAlOx catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 2. Following mechanical pulverisation of the plastic, the individual pieces were physically mixed with FeAlOx catalyst particles in a weight ratio of 1:1. Upon exposure to microwaves, hydrogen was rapidly evolved (a dehydrogenation of hydrogen-stripping process) and solid carbon and other small fragments were formed over a period of ca. 90 seconds (Fig. 2a). The evolved hydrogen rapidly increased to ca. 80 vol.% of the evolved gases in 30 seconds from the onset of the microwave initiation process. And, as will be evidenced in our insitu characterisation, the HDPE was almost decomposed or deconstructed in ca. 20s.The data for a representative 'time-on-stream' experiment for the microwaveinitiated dehydrogenation of mechanically-pulverised HDPE (in this case, waste milk containers) using the FeAlOx catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 2.

        <p>Unlike conventional thermal heating processes in which both catalytic particles and the feedstock (here plastic polyolefins) are necessarily heated, in this alternative approach, microwave electromagnetic energy is absorbed directly and preferentially at, and in, the microwave -absorbing points of the catalyst particle. Thus, heat is instead generated initially and rapidly solely at the microwave absorbing FeAlOx catalyst particles, without initially heating the surrounding pieces of HDPE. In that sense, this approach is fundamentally different to conventional, thermally-initiated catalytic processes where the entire plastic bath must be heated externally and thenthrough diffusive heat transfer and thermal convection -the catalyst particle is ultimately heated and activated. Importantly, we find that this microwave approach significantly minimises the side reactions from the thermolysis of plastic and therefore achieves an excellent control and yield of hydrogen production.Unlike conventional thermal heating processes in which both catalytic particles and the feedstock (here plastic polyolefins) are necessarily heated, in this alternative approach, microwave electromagnetic energy is absorbed directly and preferentially at, and in, the microwave -absorbing points of the catalyst particle.

        <p>As a preliminary comparison of the measured temperatures of HDPE and FeAlOx particles separately under the influence of microwave irradiation, an average temperature difference of over 400 °C was observed (Fig. 2b). The temperature of the sample (FeAlOx catalysts + HDPE) was measured by an optical pyrometer as ca. 300 °C during the microwave initiation; thus, heat then being provided for the necessary catalytic reactions, and leading to the deconstruction of HDPE. This plastic melts at about 120 -180 °C, so we clearly have a most complex heating process evolving in this heterogeneous mixture of rapidly heating solid FeAlOx catalyst particles, (locally) melting HPDE plastic (in the immediate vicinity of the catalyst) and a surrounding bath of colder, solid plastic as one moves away from the catalyst particles into the bulk of the plastic host.As a preliminary comparison of the measured temperatures of HDPE and FeAlOx particles separately under the influence of microwave irradiation, an average temperature difference of over 400 °C was observed (Fig. 2b).

        <p>The measured microwave absorption of the sample (FeAlOx + HDPE) surged in the initial time-on-stream of 10s to 20s and then dropped in the following 10 seconds (Fig. 2c); indicating, remarkably, that the catalytic chemical reactions occurred in this short period where HDPE was almost completely decomposed. This has been confirmed by our x-ray diffraction (XRD) studies (Fig. 2d) and ATR-FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2e) where no HDPE peak appears visible after 30s. The diffraction peaks of HDPE at 21.6° and 23.9°, corresponding to the typical orthorhombic unit cell structure of (110) and (200) reflection planes of HDPE 24 , were found dramatically decreased from 10s to 20s and subsequently disappeared after 30s.

        <p>XRD studies on FeAlOx catalyst before and after the microwave treatment revealed that the initially -prepared FeAlOx catalyst particles contain primarily Fe3O4 25 . The absence of XRD peaks of Al2O3 is ascribed to the low calcination temperature (350 °C), which indicates the Al2O3 is amorphous under these conditions 26 . Importantly, the presence of metallic iron and also iron carbide was detected as the microwave initiation process progressed (Fig. 2d). The peaks for elemental iron particles were observed at 2 Theta = 44.79°, and the diffraction peaks of Fe3C at the angles (2θ) of 37.84°, 42.92°, 43.82°, 44.72°, 45.04°, 45.9°, and 49.18° were observed 27 some 20s from the microwave initiation, corresponding to the degradation of plastic to yield elemental carbon and hence Fe3C.

        <p>The FeAlOx catalysts proved to be the most effective with a H2 yield of over 55. for complete dehydrogenation (deconstruction) of the plastic if we consider that the HDPE is fully decomposed to only H2 and carbonaceous materials. Moreover, the hydrogen efficiency obtained over FeAlOx catalyst is about 97% which indicates over 97% of hydrogen contained in plastic has been extracted as gases. In contrast to thermal catalytic processes, we find negligible volatile (liquid) produced (Fig. 3c) using FeAlOx. And the mass balance, calculated on the sum of gas and solid carbon is close to 100%. In contrast, Ni and Co catalysts are found less effective under microwave initiation and various small hydrocarbons, and liquid and solid are produced (Supplementary Table 1).The FeAlOx catalysts proved to be the most effective with a H2 yield of over 55. for complete dehydrogenation (deconstruction) of the plastic if we consider that the HDPE is fully decomposed to only H2 and carbonaceous materials.

We attribute this to the fundamental differences between conventional and microwave heating processes with the microwave electromagnetic energy being selectively, effectively and preferentially absorbed by FeAlOx particles without (initially) heating the bulk of plastic. This leads to a significant narrowing of the products distribution and the preferential extraction of hydrogen from plastic polymers through the microwave-initiated catalytic scission of C-H chemical bonds.In contrast, experiments using traditional thermal pyrolysis and catalytic cracking using the same FeAlOx catalyst showed a very low H2 yield of only 4.3 mmol•𝑔 𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐 -1 and also produced oil products with a yield of 66% (Fig. 3c).

The H2 selectivity in the evolved gases remained steady at ca. 76 -90 vol.% and interestingly the highest H2 selectivity was achieved at the 2 nd or 3 rd cycle (Fig. 3f) due to the inevitable extraneous oxygen contained in the FeAlOx that produced COx in the initial cycle of experiment.

        <p>In Fig. 4a, we show a 10-cycle test on HDPE@ FeAlOx. The plastic pieces were physically mixed with FeAlOx catalyst particles in a weight ratio of 1:1, and the resulting residues at each cycle were additional mixed (only) with the same amount of fresh plastic pieces between every cycles of test. The H2 yield was found to gradually decrease throughout the successive degradation of added HDPE. We attribute this gradual diminution to the substantial amount of ever-growing carbon deposition. As demonstrated in our temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy studies (Fig 4c -f) the produced carbon materials consisted primarily of MWCNTs.In Fig. 4a, we show a 10-cycle test on HDPE@ FeAlOx.

        <p>The TPO analysis supported the proposal of the formation of MWCNTs on the FeAlOx catalyst (Fig. 4c), whereby the spent samples in cycle 1 gave two peaks at around 450 °C and 560 °C, associated with amorphous carbons and CNTs, respectively 20,32 . These peaks shifted to the higher temperatures throughout the successive cycles of reaction and in addition, the peak observed at lower temperature tended to merge into the peak at higher temperature. Consequently, only one peak at about 610 °C was detected in the spent samples after 10 cycles of test, which indicates that high purity MWCNTs can indeed be manufactured from plastic waste via this process.

        <p>The fundamental difference and advance of using microwaves is due to the fact that FeAlOx catalyst particles play two roles simultaneously in this process; First, there is efficient energy transfer from the incoming microwave electromagnetic radiation to initiate the physical heating process (driving force) of the catalyst particle. Secondly, the ensuing catalytic reaction at the particle surface occurs when the particle reaches the necessary temperature. When microwaves interact with FeAlOx catalyst particles, heat is rapidly generated throughout the catalyst particles themselves (these particles have physical dimensions below the characteristic microwave skin depth at these operating frequencies). Moreover, since the microwave heating is itself a function of the electrodynamic properties of the catalyst (i.e. the charge dynamics associated with the susceptibility of the catalyst material), electromagnetic heating is closely connected to the material properties which dictates the heating ratethereby influencing the catalytic processes.The fundamental difference and advance of using microwaves is due to the fact that FeAlOx catalyst particles play two roles simultaneously in this process; First, there is efficient energy transfer from the incoming microwave electromagnetic radiation to initiate the physical heating process (driving force) of the catalyst particle.

        <p>In contrast, plastics are essentially fully transparent to incoming microwaves and the plastic substrate will initially remain cold (Fig. 5b). As have been shown in Fig. 2bthe temperature gap between the catalyst and substance can be over 400 °C. Therefore, heat is generated selectively at the catalyst and subsequently transferred to the plastic (reactant). This is an important fundamental distinction in that the heat flux (flow) is obviously directed from the surface of the catalyst particle and mass transfer will obviously occur in the same direction. This will help facilitate the desorption of neutral hydrogen (either atoms or molecules) from the active sites on the catalyst surface. This is fundamentally different from a conventional heating catalytic process, usually limited by the mass transfer rate of molecular desorption.In contrast, plastics are essentially fully transparent to incoming microwaves and the plastic substrate will initially remain cold (Fig. 5b).

        <p>Given that the plastic is surely melted in the vicinity of the (constantly) heating catalyst particle, the polymer molecules have large kinetic energy in order to create a high frequency of collisions on the catalyst active sites. That will clearly lead to an increase in the key factors in the Arrhenius reaction equation (k = A exp(-Ea /kT)), most notably the pre-exponential factor, A, which represents the collision frequency between the (incoming) reactant (polymer) molecules and the active sites, while the exponential factor represents the quantity of species that can overcome the activation energy barrier.Given that the plastic is surely melted in the vicinity of the (constantly) heating catalyst particle, the polymer molecules have large kinetic energy in order to create a high frequency of collisions on the catalyst active sites.

        <p>Most significant, therefore, we believe that microwave electromagnetic radiation enhances the desorption of product H2 molecules from the catalyst surface. This does raise also the fundamental issue of the comparison of traditional conditions (thermal heating) with this microwave-initiated regime. As noted elsewhere 39 , direct comparison is not always possible because of the intrinsic difficulties relating to the true localprocess temperature at the catalyst in the latter case. If indeed, this local temperature is much higher than our pyrometer -measured temperatures, the kinetic energy of our gaseous product, H2 will also assist rapid diffusion away from the catalyst.Most significant, therefore, we believe that microwave electromagnetic radiation enhances the desorption of product H2 molecules from the catalyst surface.

        <p>In Fig. 5f we show a representative finite element simulation model mapping of the E-field strength and the heating rate at the interface of a spherical Fe particle with plastic, based upon a quasi-static solution of the electromagnetic fields 38 (see Method for details). From these simulations, we find both the E-field strength and the heating rate at the interface increased significantly due to the interfacial polarisation. The Efield strength at the interface of catalyst and plastic is about 3 times larger than in the bulk plastic. Due to the fact that microwave electric fields will be screened from the deep interior of the Fe particle, localised high E-field and heating will occur at the particle surface 37 . Recent advances in the field-assisted catalysis have shown electric fields can affect catalytic activity and selectivity with a focus on heterogeneous catalysts in much the same way as temperature and pressure 40 . The computational and experimental studies by Che et al. 41,42 for the methane steam reforming reaction (MSR) have shown an electric field can improve the efficiency of MSR processes and lower the overall temperature requirements.In Fig. 5f we show a representative finite element simulation model mapping of the E-field strength and the heating rate at the interface of a spherical Fe particle with plastic, based upon a quasi-static solution of the electromagnetic fields 38 (see Method for details).

        <p>Furthermore, the close contact/ proximity of catalyst particles and plastic pieces in the interaction with the incoming microwave irradiation could potentially generate nonequilibrium plasma in their interface and thus enhance the catalytic reactions. In several studies [43][44][45] the combination of plasma and catalysts has been found to have synergistic effects. Combining plasma with a solid catalyst whose dielectric properties and morphology are suitable, enhancement of the average electric field strength can occur, resulting in an enhanced efficiency of the chemical reactions taking place on the dual system. Surface adsorption within a plasma volume can make a significant contribution to improved reaction performance. When reactant molecules (here plastic polymers) are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, the retention time and concentration of those species in the plasma can be enhanced.

Hence the catalytic process takes place only at the interface between the hot (and almost certainly constantly heating) catalyst particle and the (initially) cold plastic (substrate or "bath") and the cleavage of C-H bonds is dominant.In summary, for the present process, we believe that the very nature of microwave initiation of these catalytic chemical reactions significantly minimises the (potentially numerous) chemical side reactions.

        <p>The microwave heating system chain prior to the applicator consisted of a power generator, microwave head, microwave circulator, dummy load, microwave power meters and tuneable waveguide sections (Sairem Ltd.). The system was computer controlled using 
            <rs type="software">Labview</rs> software. The applicator section was fabricated in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford. The operating frequency was 2450 MHz (± 25 MHz) from 10% to 100% of nominal power. The maximum output power was 2000 W with 1% stability from 10% to 100% of maximum power after thirty minutes on. The microwave source is a magnetron with a ripple rate of &lt; 1% RMS from 10% to 100%. The power rise time is about 100 μs. The power generator is a resonant switching converter with frequencies of 30 kHz up to 80 kHz and an efficiency of 93% at nominal power. The power supply and microwave head are both water and air cooled. The microwave output is via WR 340 waveguides. The generator is controlled remotely via an RS232 MODBUS gateway using 
            <rs type="software">Labview</rs> software. The reflected power R, was measured by a crystal detector mounted onto the isolator load, from which we determine the power absorbed by the sample, P. If the power transmitted to the applicator is W, then P = W -R -X, where X is the microwave power lost in the cavity walls and through minor applicator leakages. The applicator used was a TM010 resonant cavity to enable a well-characterized field distribution and high nominal field strength.

Then, the sample was irradiated under 1000 W microwave power (unless stated otherwise) for 3-5 min. The generated gases are collected and analysed by Gas Chromatography (GC) using a Perkin-Elmer, Clarus 580 GC. A ''Cold trap'' was set up for collecting liquid products.The sample of mixture (catalyst + plastic) was placed in a quartz tube (inner diameter 6mm, outer diameter 9mm), with typically volumes of about 1.13 cm 3 and the height of about 3.5-4cm. This is to ensure the sample is fully exposed to the axially polarised (TM010) uniform electric fields (4 cm long). Then, the filled tube was placed axially in the centre of the TM010 microwave cavity in order to minimise depolarisation effects under microwave radiation.

        <p>We define the volume % of the product composition in the evolved gases from GC analysis as selectivity. And the mass of each gas products was calculated according to the volume of gases obtained and the composition analysis from GC. We therefore describe the H2 yield as the mole of H2 obtained divided by the total weight of plastic (Eq. 1). The Hydrogen Efficiency is determined as the total mass of hydrogen contained in all gas products divided by the theoretical mass of H contained in the plastic (Eq. 2). The gas yield is calculated by the mass obtained in relation to the total weight of plastic which is given by Eq. 3. The solid (carbon) yield was then determined as the mass difference between fresh and spent sample in relation to the total weight of feedstock (Eq. 4). The mass balance is obtained based on the sum of gas and solid yields because a negligible amount of volatile (liquid) is produced in these processes and undetectable. But for comparison purpose, we estimated the oil yield (liquid yield) as, 100% -gas yieldcarbon yield (Eq. 5). The morphologies of produced multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were also examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using JEM-3000F microscope (300 kV). The sample powder was dispersed in ethanol in an ultra-sonic bath for 15 min. The solution was then drop cast onto a 300-mesh copper TEM holey carbon grid on a filter paper and allowed to evaporate. Scale bars of all the TEM images were calibrated using an oriented gold crystal grid.We define the volume % of the product composition in the evolved gases from GC analysis as selectivity.

        <p>Finite element modelling of microwave receptors and plastic was carried out using 
            <rs type="software">COMSOL</rs> v
            <rs type="version">4.4</rs> software. A representative, spherical particle of radius 2µm was used to provide a baseline for field distributions around particles. Changes in aspect ratio can lead to an increased depolarisation factor and a dramatic increase in the field strength at the extremities of the structure.

        <p>In the simulation model, a representative spherical catalyst particle is embedded in the surface of the plastic. In the quasi-static regime, we apply a uniform quasi-microwave E-field and solve for the field strengths with frequency appropriate complex permittivities assigned to the model domains. The microwave heating rate per unit volume 〈𝑃 𝐸 〉 in Joules per second is then calculated by 〈𝑃 𝐸 〉 = 1 2 𝜔𝜀 0 𝜀 2 𝐸 0 2 , where 𝜔 is the angular frequency, 𝜀 0 is the permittivity of free space, 𝜀 2 is the local imaginary permittivity and 𝐸 0 is the applied microwave electric field strength.

        <p>The heating mechanism in this work is via the microwave-electric field at a frequency of 2.45GHz, thus the model is in the long-wavelength regime and uniform fields may be applied in a quasi-static analysis. In addition, the skin depth of iron at 2.45GHz is hundreds of microns, accounting for its increased permeability, and does not affect our simulation.
