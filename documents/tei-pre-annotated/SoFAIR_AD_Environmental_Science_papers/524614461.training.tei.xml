        <p>The Ukraine war has immensely affected both food and energy systems due to the significant role of Russia in supplying natural gas and fertilizers globally and the extensive contribution of both Russia and Ukraine in exporting grains and oilseeds to the international markets. Hence, the Ukraine-Russia conflict has resulted in a shortage of crops and grains in the food market, especially in Europe, causing speculations if these resources should still be used for biofuel production (1 st Generation). However, the International Energy Agency has warned that lowering biofuel mandates could result in rising petroleum demand and supply concerns. In light of these unfolding events, a systems thinking approach is required to monitor and analyze the implications of this crisis for food and biofuel markets as a whole to alleviate the concerns faced and plan sustainably. In this vein, based on the trade-offs between food system elements and the biofuel supply chain, as well as the potential effects of the war on the food and energy systems worldwide, a causal loop diagram is developed in the present work. According to the insights provided, the key to preventing food insecurity and keeping biofuel mandates on an increasing trend simultaneously amid the Ukraine war is to switch from the 1 st Generation biofuels to higher generations. This transition would reduce not only the pressure on the food market to move toward zero hunger (SDG 2) but also pave the way to move towards a circular economy and clean and affordable energy (SDG 7) during the post-war era.The Ukraine war has immensely affected both food and energy systems due to the significant role of Russia in supplying natural gas and fertilizers globally and the extensive contribution of both Russia and Ukraine in exporting grains and oilseeds to the international markets.

        <p>During the past two years, global economies were strongly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the food and energy markets were faced with an imbalance of supply and demand, resulting in an increased cost of living all over the world. Unfortunately, the global community has been shocked again by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, which has brought about huge casualties on both sides and has added to the food and market challenges in the already volatile post-COVID-19 market. These crises have led to increased vulnerability and food insecurity worldwide.During the past two years, global economies were strongly hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the food and energy markets were faced with an imbalance of supply and demand, resulting in an increased cost of living all over the world.

        <p>Both Russia and Ukraine play key roles in the energy, food, and fertilizers markets. While Russia is the world's largest exporter of wheat, the second largest exporter of sunflower oil, and the largest exporter of fertilizers, Ukraine is the largest exporter of sunflower oil, the fourth largest exporter of maize, and the fifth largest exporter of wheat (Benton et al., 2022). Therefore, the disrupted agricultural production in Ukraine, which is likely to continue even in the postwar era, and the extensive international sanctions imposed on Russia, limiting the country`s trades, are expected to impact both food and fuel markets. As for the latter, in addition to the petroleum price increase, the Ukraine war has disrupted the biofuel feedstock supply chain and, consequently, adversely affected biofuels production. The main culprit is the existing food vs fuel competition over agricultural commodities. More specifically, biofuel production has already been criticized for its impact on increasing food/feed commodity prices and the consequent contribution to food insecurity (Koizumi, 2015; Martínez-Jaramillo et al., 2019; Subramaniam et al., 2019). Approximately 10% of all grain supplies worldwide are used for biofuel production (Biofuels International, 2022), which could alternatively be used to reduce food insecurity in many parts of the world. Biofuel production from edible resources is also considered a contributor to land-use change and climate change (Yan et al., 2021).Both Russia and Ukraine play key roles in the energy, food, and fertilizers markets.

        <p>The decline in crop supply and the resulting rising prices have further intensified the food vs fuel conflict encouraging calls by major media outlets for easing biofuel production mandates in favour of food systems amid the Ukraine war to prevent further food insecurity (Grunwald, 2022;Le Page, 2022). On the other hand, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned about the consequences of such diversion, highlighting that reducing biofuel mandates could further increase petroleum prices and cause energy supply concerns (Biofuels International, 2022).The decline in crop supply and the resulting rising prices have further intensified the food vs fuel conflict encouraging calls by major media outlets for easing biofuel production mandates in favour of food systems amid the Ukraine war to prevent further food insecurity (Grunwald, 2022;Le Page, 2022).

        <p>The interconnectedness of food and energy markets on the global scale and the food and energy crises triggered by the Ukraine-Russia war highlight the significance of addressing these challenges as interrelated systemic risks rather than in isolation (Benton et al., 2022). Therefore, this research adopts a systems thinking approach to analyze the interconnections among food and biofuels market elements, their role in climate change, and the impact of war on them. In this vein, a causal-loop diagram (CLD) is developed to better address and clarify the existing interconnections and feedback structures. In addition to the 1 st Generation (1 st G) biofuels that use food/feed crops as their feedstock, the role of shifting from the 1 st G biofuels to higher generations is discussed in the presented CLD.The interconnectedness of food and energy markets on the global scale and the food and energy crises triggered by the Ukraine-Russia war highlight the significance of addressing these challenges as interrelated systemic risks rather than in isolation (Benton et al., 2022).

        <p>The complexity of food systems and biofuel production dynamics, which can be translated into food and energy security, is acknowledged in the literature (Pruyt and Sitter, 2008;Koizumi, 2015;Weng et al., 2019). Moreover, the need to study the interlinkages and the system behaviour as a whole has been highlighted (Pruyt and Sitter, 2008;Ansah, 2014;Martínez-Jaramillo et al., 2019). The Ukraine war and sanctions on Russia have further increased this complexity. Therefore, the concerns and challenging aspects discussed in the introduction section can be put together in a systems model and analyzed from a systems thinking perspective, which tries to understand a certain event by seeing things as a whole instead of isolated parts. In better words, systems thinking aims at improving the understanding of the ways through which the performance of an organization/system is related to its internal structure and external operating policies and tries to use that understanding to design policies for success (Sterman, 2000;Forliano et al., 2022). In this context, the system science set of tools, including CLDs, provide a powerful framework to better comprehend the complex interplay of factors affecting the organization's/system's performance (Sterman, 2006). CLDs explicitly present the structural and agent system elements that may endogenously generate the dynamics in the behaviour of the system or organization being studied (Papachristos and Struben, 2020).The complexity of food systems and biofuel production dynamics, which can be translated into food and energy security, is acknowledged in the literature (Pruyt and Sitter, 2008;Koizumi, 2015;Weng et al., 2019).

        <p>As Loop B1 in Figure 2 shows, the rise of fertilizer prices and the reduction in the production and export of crops and grain by the two conflicting countries have negatively affected the supply of crops and grain and, consequently, have led to a shortage of crops and grain in their customer countries. A potential solution to deal with the shortage of farmbased products could be their domestic production. However, this solution is not feasible within a short period and might even be infeasible because of economic reasons or resource depletion that has originally provided the ground for importing these products. Due to time restrictions for production, export, and import planning, finding immediate replacements for Ukraine and Russia also seems infeasible, resulting in a shortage of crops and grains in the food market, especially in Europe. Based on Loop B2 in Figure 2, the rise in the petroleum price since the onset of the war in Ukraine has also affected the biofuel market. The main mechanism in a market is switching towards using an alternative (such as biofuel) when there is an increase in the price of the original commodity (such as petroleum in this case), which consequently results in the reduction of demand for the original commodity, followed by a decrease in its price. This mechanism is reflected in Loop B2, which is then affected by other feedback structures.As Loop B1 in Figure 2 shows, the rise of fertilizer prices and the reduction in the production and export of crops and grain by the two conflicting countries have negatively affected the supply of crops and grain and, consequently, have led to a shortage of crops and grain in their customer countries.

        <p>However, despite the rise in the petroleum price, the increases in food and feedstock prices amid the Ukraine war have increased the biofuels price, leading to the adjustment of biofuel blending mandates in some the European countries (Biofuels International, 2022). In this regard, the IEA has warned that lowering biofuel mandates could result in rising petroleum demands and, subsequently, supply concerns (Biofuels International, 2022). ). The Ukraine-Russia crisis has also intensified the current food availability and price challenges. Reduction of crop supply resulting from the military conflict in Ukraine, on the one hand, and using parts of crops supply for biofuel production, on the other hand, have lowered the available crops for food consumption. Biofuels produced are mainly farm-grown energies, and their main feedstock is agricultural commodities (i.e., 1 st G biofuel). Therefore, they compete for natural and agricultural resources with food. The reduced Please cite this article as: Shams Esfandabadi Z., Ranjbari M., Scagnelli S.D.

Shortage of crop supply for food consumption could result in famine and affect food security. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), "food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life", and availability, access, utilization, and stability constitute the pillars of food security (FAO, 2009). Thus, the "availability" pillar of food security is affected by the shortage of crops supply for food, leading to food insecurity. If the food market is not managed properly, food insecurity might turn into food shortage mortality, principally reducing the global population and the overall demand for food, leading to a lower food shortage.However, despite the rise in the petroleum price, the increases in food and feedstock prices amid the Ukraine war have increased the biofuels price, leading to the adjustment of biofuel blending mandates in some the European countries (Biofuels International, 2022).

        <p>Moreover, the demand for crops by both food and biofuel markets leads to increases in crop prices and, therefore, rises in food prices. Rising food prices threaten at first the food security of the poor by limiting their "access" to food, highlighting the disruption of another pillar of food security. If the crop's market is not effectively managed, the food insecurity could affect other income groups, especially in the countries that are heavily dependent on food imports.Moreover, the demand for crops by both food and biofuel markets leads to increases in crop prices and, therefore, rises in food prices.

        <p>Figure 4 illustrates 3 main loops. Loop B4, indirectly explained in Section 3.2, addresses the balancing of crop prices in the food market. Based on this loop, when the total demand for crops by the food and energy markets rises, the resulting increment in the crops price increases the food price. Consequently, higher prices lower the demand for crops to be used as food, and the total demand decreases.Figure 4 illustrates 3 main loops.

        <p>Loop B5, sharing two variables with Loop B4, highlights the role of the biofuel market in crop prices. This loop focuses on the 1 st G biofuel production, which is a competitor for the food market in terms of crop consumption. As depicted in Figure 4, the biofuel mandates set by the countries affect the demand for the feedstock required for biofuel production. In the case of 1 st G biofuel production, the demand for crops increases due to higher mandates. Consequently, the total demand formed for crops increases the crop prices and, therefore, the price of biofuels. The higher the biofuel price, the lower the interest in setting high levels of biofuel mandates. In this vein, some European countries have reported interest in reducing or freezing the biofuel mandates and adjusting biofuelblending mandates after the biofuel prices increased due to the Ukraine-Russia war (Biofuels International, 2022).Loop B5, sharing two variables with Loop B4, highlights the role of the biofuel market in crop prices.

        <p>The only reinforcing loop in Figure 4, i.e., Loop R1, tries to highlight the role of other biofuel generations in reducing the biofuel price and helping countries set higher biofuel mandates with the least possible effect on the food market. Based on this loop, if the demand for feedstock to address the biofuel mandates is satisfied by the supply of bio-based waste, algae, or genetically engineered feedstocks to produce 2 nd , 3 rd , or 4 th G biofuels (Ranjbari et al., 2022), biofuel prices would fall as they would not be any longer affected by the prices of the crops. Using feedstock other than food crops not only helps mitigate the adverse effect of war on the food price and food security but also helps move toward building a more circular economy (Ranjbari et al., 2021c) and prevent deforestation. Research on the sustainability assessment and economic evaluation of using other feedstock than food crops indicates their economic viability (Jin et al., 2019) and lower climate change impacts (Agarwal and Sharma, 2020; Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha et al., 2022). (Hassan and Kalam, 2013). On this basis, worsening climate change pushes countries towards setting higher levels of biofuel mandates. Consequently, as Loop R2 indicates, the demand for feedstock would rise, translating into a growth in crop demand for 1 st G biofuels production. The increased demand for crops requires more land for cultivation, leading to deforestation based on Loop B6, and hence, higher levels of climate change would be expected. Loop B6 is activated when the required land for crop cultivation is more than the maximum available land for cultivation. In this case, more forests would be destroyed and changed to farmlands to support both food and biofuel markets, posing additional risks to the ecosystem, including loss of biodiversity.The only reinforcing loop in Figure 4, i.e., Loop R1, tries to highlight the role of other biofuel generations in reducing the biofuel price and helping countries set higher biofuel mandates with the least possible effect on the food market.

        <p>As mentioned earlier, due to the competition between 1 st G biofuels and the food market, the demand for crops to be used as biofuel feedstock affects the available crops for food. Therefore, based on Loop B7, which includes all the variables present in Loop R2, setting higher biofuel mandates by the decision-makers due to the worsening climate change, increases the crop demand in the biofuel production system. This increase in demand is followed by the reduction in the available crops to be consumed in the food systems, increased food shortage, food insecurity, and increased mortality rate due to food shortage. Hypothetically, a shrinking global population would be expected to lower the demand for crops, reducing the need for cultivation lands and deforestation. In this case, the outcome would be an improvement in climate change mitigation. Please cite this article as: Shams Esfandabadi Z., Ranjbari M., Scagnelli S.D.

        <p>Nevertheless, if the decision-makers focus on biofuel generations other than the 1 st G, the biofuel market would, to a great extent, be decoupled from the food market, and therefore, the land-use change would not be such a challenging issue.Nevertheless, if the decision-makers focus on biofuel generations other than the 1 st G, the biofuel market would, to a great extent, be decoupled from the food market, and therefore, the land-use change would not be such a challenging issue.</p>
        <p>The effect of the Ukraine-Russia war on food and biofuel markets requires a systems thinking approach to better analyze the challenges and find solutions to lower the unfavourable outcomes. In line with Pruyt and Sitter (2008), now that the world is close to a food crisis -if not managed properly-, the food sector should be prioritized over the biofuel sector for receiving crops supply. However, based on the CLD presented in this research, the key to preventing food insecurity and keeping biofuel mandates on an increasing trend simultaneously amid the Ukraine war is accelerating the transition from the 1 st G biofuels to the higher generations. In fact, using bio-based wastes, algae, and genetically engineered feedstocks to produce biofuel removes the competition between food and biofuel markets in consuming the available agricultural commodities, whose supply has already been compromised by the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war. Regardless of the result of this military conflict, the transition towards the production of 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th G biofuels seems like an inevitable option by the decision-makers to control the food supply and food prices, save the environment, intensify climate mitigation, and support providing affordable and clean energy for all as mandated by the SDG 7.The effect of the Ukraine-Russia war on food and biofuel markets requires a systems thinking approach to better analyze the challenges and find solutions to lower the unfavourable outcomes.

However, based on the CLD presented in this research, the key to preventing food insecurity and keeping biofuel mandates on an increasing trend simultaneously amid the Ukraine war is accelerating the transition from the 1 st G biofuels to the higher generations. In fact, using bio-based wastes, algae, and genetically engineered feedstocks to produce biofuel removes the competition between food and biofuel markets in consuming the available agricultural commodities, whose supply has already been compromised by the onset of the Ukraine-Russia war. Regardless of the result of this military conflict, the transition towards the production of 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th G biofuels seems like an inevitable option by the decision-makers to control the food supply and food prices, save the environment, intensify climate mitigation, and support providing affordable and clean energy for all as mandated by the SDG 7.</p>
        <p>To the best of our knowledge, the present research was the first to address the effects of the Ukraine-Russia war on the food and biofuel markets simultaneously from the lens of systems thinking. Hence, the presented CLD is an initial sketch, yet a comprehensive one, which can be further extended and analyzed in more detail by future studies. Since simulations can better portray the outcome of the feedback structures, future research should also focus on developing a quantitative System Dynamics simulation model based on the CLD presented in this research.To the best of our knowledge, the present research was the first to address the effects of the Ukraine-Russia war on the food and biofuel markets simultaneously from the lens of systems thinking.
