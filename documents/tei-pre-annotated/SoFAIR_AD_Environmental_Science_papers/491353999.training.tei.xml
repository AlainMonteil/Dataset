        <p>Invasive alien species (IAS) are those introduced to a novel range, where they establish and spread, often causing adverse ecological, social and/or economic impacts (Blackburn et al., 2011;Pyšek et al., 2020). Biological invasions have been identified as a major cause of native species extinction (Bellard et al., 2016), degradation of ecosystem functions and services (Vilà and Hulme, 2017), emergence and dissemination of infectious diseases (Ogden et al., 2019), and economic cost at the trillion-US$ scale worldwide (Diagne et al., 2021a). With invasion rates strongly related to rising globalisation (Bonnamour et al., 2021) and expected to keep increasing over coming decades from new source pools (Seebens et al., 2021;Cuthbert et al., 2022a), the burden of IAS on ecosystems and human wellbeing is also likely to rise.Invasive alien species (IAS) are those introduced to a novel range, where they establish and spread, often causing adverse ecological, social and/or economic impacts (Blackburn et al., 2011;Pyšek et al., 2020).

        <p>Management of this steadily increasing number of IAS remains a major societal challenge for the 21st century (Seebens et al., 2017;Robertson et al., 2020). Among other national and international mandates, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD, 2010) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015) emphasise the need to prevent new species introduction and reduce impacts of IAS, as well as to identify priority species for control or eradication. Approaches to IAS management can take several forms, broadly classified as prevention, rapid eradication, or long-term management (although definitions and terminology can vary; Robertson et al., 2020). This is because biological invasion is a stage-based process, defined through transport, introduction, establishment and spread of IAS (Blackburn et al., 2011). Management at earlyinvasion stages (e.g. biosecurity and prevention) is often driven by precaution based on evidence of adverse impacts elsewhere, whereas late-invasion stage management (e.g. control or eradication) is more often reactive, following the detection of impacts in situ (Simberloff et al., 2013).Management of this steadily increasing number of IAS remains a major societal challenge for the 21st century (Seebens et al., 2017;Robertson et al., 2020).

        <p>Currently, theoretical evidence highlights the potential long-term economic benefits of acting early and prioritising investment in preventative measures (Ahmed et al., 2021), but bioeconomic risk models have found societies typically invest far less than is warranted in biosecurity actions (Leung et al., 2002). Given the impediments and costs associated with late-stage management (Simberloff et al., 2013), this may seem surprising. However, the difficulty in translating ecological, social and cultural IAS impacts into monetary terms (Hanley and Roberts, 2019), the need to further develop decision-making tools to optimise management efforts (Booy et al., 2020), and the lack of a sufficient understanding of the economic costs of biological invasions have likely contributed to inadequate spending on IAS management and inefficient decision-making (Diagne et al., 2020a(Diagne et al., , 2021a)).Currently, theoretical evidence highlights the potential long-term economic benefits of acting early and prioritising investment in preventative measures (Ahmed et al., 2021), but bioeconomic risk models have found societies typically invest far less than is warranted in biosecurity actions (Leung et al., 2002).

        <p>Recently, the InvaCost database has been compiled to fill this gap in collating and understanding reported economic costs of biological invasions in a globally standardised manner (Diagne et al., 2020b), allowing for relevant comparisons across different scales and contexts. Descriptors in this database include a categorisation of the type of cost incurred, distinguishing primarily between damage (i.e. resource degradation or loss) and management (i.e. expenditures to prevent, control or eradicate IAS); as well as the type and stage of management investment (i.e. pre-invasion, postinvasion, funding/knowledge). National and international studies based on these data have consistently shown that management expenditures represent only a small fraction of the costs of IAS damage (e.g. Bradshaw et al., 2021;Haubrock et al., 2021a;Heringer et al., 2021;Kirichenko et al., 2021;Kourantidou et al., 2021;Cuthbert et al., 2022b). At the same time, overall damage costs have increased at a higher rate than management expenditures (Diagne et al., 2021a), suggesting that the way in which management investments are undertaken deserves careful consideration across time, space and taxonomic groups. The fundamental fact that damage costs are rising rapidly indicates that better management is needed to reduce future impacts. Nevertheless, no studies have placed global management spending in the context of damage costs using the latest version of the InvaCost database or considering different management types. Such a quantification could provide compelling evidence that management is warranted if management spending is substantially lower than incurred damage costs, and is accordingly not implemented at the sole benefit of agencies involved (Leung et al., 2002;Cuthbert et al., 2020).Recently, the InvaCost database has been compiled to fill this gap in collating and understanding reported economic costs of biological invasions in a globally standardised manner (Diagne et al., 2020b), allowing for relevant comparisons across different scales and contexts.

        <p>Here, we use this InvaCost database to identify patterns and trends, research biases, and knowledge gaps surrounding management expenditures against biological invasions worldwide. Our aims were to (i) quantify management costs relative to IAS damage costs, (ii) characterise management expenditures for IAS at different spatial, taxonomic, environmental and temporal scales, (iii) model ecological and socio-economic determinants of damage costs and management spending, as well as potential savings should management have been more timely, and (iv) identify avenues for further efficient spending and research on IAS management.Here, we use this InvaCost database to identify patterns and trends, research biases, and knowledge gaps surrounding management expenditures against biological invasions worldwide.

        <p>We used cost data collected from studies across the globe and presented in the latest version of the InvaCost database at the time of writing (version 4.0; 13,123 cost entries; Diagne et al., 2020b;Angulo et al., 2021a;doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12668570). All costs were adjusted for inflation through the Consumer Price Index (https://data.worldbank. org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL?end=2017&amp;start=1960) and are reported in 2017-value United States (US) dollars (hereafter, $; Diagne et al., 2020b) in order to be comparable across space and over time.We used cost data collected from studies across the globe and presented in the latest version of the InvaCost database at the time of writing (version 4.0; 13,123 cost entries; Diagne et al., 2020b;Angulo et al., 2021a;doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12668570).

        <p>As cost estimates in InvaCost are made under different temporal scales, we annualised the data based on the difference between the "Probable_starting_year_adjusted" and "Probable_starting_year_adjusted" (i.e. the approximate starting and ending years of the cost; see doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12668570 for description) columns using the expandYearlyCosts function of the '

            <rs type="creator">R Core Team</rs>, 2020; Leroy et al., 2021). Each expanded entry thus corresponded to a single year for which costs were available following this expansion process, i.e. costs spanning multiple years were divided among those same years (e.g. a single cost entry of $20 million between 1991 and 2000 in the original database was transformed to ten cost entries of $2 million annually across those ten years). Following expansion, we considered only costs that impacted years between 1960 and 2020, respectively reflecting the first year appropriate exchange rates could be determined and the last year costs were searched for.

        <p>We then performed several filtering steps to this dataset so that we obtained the most robust subset (hereafter called "filtered dataset"), considering the nature of the cost and quality of the source material. First, we filtered the database to include "observed" costs only (thus excluding "potential" costs), since we were interested in definitively realised costs over time rather than those that had been extrapolated or predicted to potentially occur either in space or time. Second, we retained only costs classified as "highly reliable" (thus excluding "low reliability" costs), meaning that we used exclusively those that were either published in peer-reviewed journals and official reports or, if they were found in grey literature, that had adequately supported, replicable analyses and justified assumptions. Third, we filtered out "mixed" cost types (n = 560 unexpanded entries) to keep only costs that were clearly determined to be either "management" or "damage" costs (in order to place management costs into a wider context as a proportion of IAS damages). Last, we removed entries for which the management type was unspecified (for management costs only; n = 124 unexpanded entries) or where the temporal duration of the cost was unclear (i.e. missing "Probable_starting_year_adjusted" and/or "Probable_ending_year_adjusted", because the cost could not be expanded over time in those cases). Unless specified, all results are provided for the filtered dataset, but results using unfiltered data (i.e. including "low reliability" and "potential" costs) are presented initially.

        <p>We compared the total cumulative and mean annual costs of damage and management costs, as well as the different management categories defined above, and how they evolved over time. This was done using the summarizeCosts function of the 'invacost' 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package (Leroy et al., 2021), thereby determining the decadal and absolute annual average expenditures for (i) total management, (ii) total damage, (iii) pre-invasion management, (iv) post-invasion management and (v) knowledge funding.
        </p>
        <p>We built two models to examine the predictiveness of biosecurity investment for the total management or damage cost incurred by a nation in a given decade (n = 7 decades 1960-2020; n = 102 countries; n = 198 [country + decade] pairs). To do this, we first summed our cost data within each decade and within each country, employing the '
            <rs type="software">countrycode</rs>' 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package (Arel-Bundock et al., 2018) to ensure consistent country naming by converting all InvaCost country records to ISO3C codes. In both models, we included several other factors hypothesised to influence economic impacts of biological invasion (Haubrock et al., 2021a(Haubrock et al., , 2021b;;Kourantidou et al., 2021), including the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and human population of each country in 2014 (from the World Bank, adapted from Sardain et al., 2019), as well as total volume of imports in metric tonnes (BACI CEPII 2021; http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/ presentation.asp?id=37), either using the annual average from 2015 to 2019 or a historical annual average from 1995 to 1999 (given our data were grouped by decade and that historical trade can be more predictive of present day invasion risk due to invasion lags; see Latombe et al., 2021). We also included a measure of the total invader burden in a country from the sTwist first record database (Seebens et al., 2017), calculated as the cumulative number of species first records up to that decade. Models were formulated as generalised additive models (GAM) using the 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> package '
            <rs type="software">mgcv</rs>' (Wood, 2011) in order to include temporal terms as thin plate smoothers. This allowed us to detrend our cost data with respect to time and to explore potential non-monotonic relationships between cost and lags in management. In addition to the decade term, we also calculated the mean time difference between a particular decade and each IAS' first management cost record within each country. This allowed us to get a measure of mean time since first management onset across countries and decades, and to see whether this time-since-management term was predictive of total management or damage costs in each country and decade. Within the GAM, we employed the 'select' method to avoid the overparameterisation of our smoother terms. This method uses a crossvalidation approach to penalise overfitted smoother terms (using the GCV.Cp method). All non-smoothed variables were log e -transformed prior to analysis to meet model assumptions as determined by GAM modelchecking results. Overall, two full models were built with (i) total damage costs and (ii) total management costs as response variables per decade and country, according to the aforementioned 12 predictor variables [i.e. damage cost (for management model only), pre-invasion management spending, post-invasion management spending (for damage model only), knowledge funding, number of unique cost references, current trade imports, historical trade imports, population size, GDP, species richness, first invasion records, decade, and time since first management record]. Models were checked for high concurvity (the GAM equivalent of multicollinearity; Wood, 2011) and when predictor variables were highly correlated (r &gt; 0.8), the predictor with the greatest correlation with the response variable was retained. All code and derived data are available at github.com/emmajhudgins/biosecurity_invacost.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the two main GAM models, we examined trends in the degree of proactive (i.e. pre-invasion) and reactive (i.e. post-invasion) management across IAS, countries, and time by fitting a linear model of management delay to each IAS-country pair reported in each decade. For instance, if an IAS had its first recorded damage cost in Canada in 1985 and its first recorded management cost in Canada in 1992, we obtained a minimum management delay of 7 years for that species in Canada that was associated with the year 1985. Any entry without management spending to date was assigned 2020 as the year of management, although we note that this is necessarily an underestimate of the true delay.In addition to the two main GAM models, we examined trends in the degree of proactive (i.e. pre-invasion) and reactive (i.e. post-invasion) management across IAS, countries, and time by fitting a linear model of management delay to each IAS-country pair reported in each decade.

        <p>We set out to quantify the additional cost incurred due to delayed management action (i.e. the cost of inaction) on a global scale using the filtered dataset. We applied the cost model developed by Ahmed et al. (2021), which predicts the temporal dynamics of potential damage and inaction costs by fitting cost curves to damage and management cost data (Supplementary Material 3). Globally aggregated damage costs were reported on an annual basis from 1960 to 2020, with a maximum reported cost value of $216.6 billion in 2004. Management costs were also reported yearly over the same time period, with a maximum cost of $7.4 billion in 2002.We set out to quantify the additional cost incurred due to delayed management action (i.e. the cost of inaction) on a global scale using the filtered dataset.

            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> (Supplementary Material 3), where estimated model parameters included the intrinsic cost growth rate, cost carrying capacity, management efficiency and the initial cost at the time of first detection (Supplementary Material 3, Ahmed et al., 2021).

        <p>Considering the unfiltered dataset (i.e. including low reliability and potential costs), expenditure for managing invasions has totalled $307.9 billion between 1960 and 2020 worldwide, based on 20,758 expanded cost entries from the InvaCost database (hereafter, n); a value that sums to only 6% of the total recorded damages incurred from IAS worldwide ($5118.6 billion, n = 10,494) (Supplementary Material 4). Total management costs were greatest in North America ($92.9 billion) and Oceania ($92.0 billion), then Asia ($48.9 billion), with the remainder each contributing under $30 billion. Considering total costs, all regions, except Antarctic-Subantarctic (damage cost = $0.9 million; management cost = $6.1 million; represented mainly by French Southern and Antarctic Lands, and South Georgia), spent less on management than was incurred in damages, ranging from 3-times less in Oceania to 92-times less in South America (Supplementary Material 4).Considering the unfiltered dataset (i.e. including low reliability and potential costs), expenditure for managing invasions has totalled $307.9 billion between 1960 and 2020 worldwide, based on 20,758 expanded cost entries from the InvaCost database (hereafter, n); a value that sums to only 6% of the total recorded damages incurred from IAS worldwide ($5118.6 billion, n = 10,494) (Supplementary Material 4).

        <p>Through our model, we estimated that damage costs accumulated to $1291.4 billion from 1960 to 2020, whereas management costs amounted to only $158.0 billion. Assuming that these cost patterns reflected immediate management action for all species in all countries, management efficiency was constant over time, with a reduction of $53.5 in potential damage costs estimated for every $1 spent on management. If we instead assumed that all invasions were subject to our mean observed management delay time of 10.7 years, we estimated that this delay resulted in an additional global cost of $1247.2 billion relative to a scenario with immediate management.

We also estimated that 95% of the cost of inaction was attained after a management delay time of approximately five decades, meaning that after delaying management by 50 years, the additional cost of waiting to manage does not increase much each year, highlighting the need for timely management of IAS (Supplementary Material 3).

While these cost figures derived from the InvaCost database should not be perceived as exact totals (Diagne et al., 2021a), they represent the most up-to-date and exhaustive overview of management costs globally and allow us to investigate largescale patterns. Our results reveal largely disparate, inadequate and rarely proactive management investments for addressing current and future IAS impacts. Consistent and marked differences in management typology were found, with proactive pre-invasion investments comprising a tiny fraction ($2.8 billion) of the filtered cost total -25-times lower than reactive, post-invasion management. This trend was consistent among regions, with all regions (except offshore territories in the Antarctic-Subantarctic, where economic assets to be damaged are few) exhibiting substantially less management expenditures than observed damages, and always least in preinvasion management. However, the magnitude of the difference between management types was greatest in Africa, Asia and South America, suggesting varying strategies or capacities to manage IAS or report costs. Geographical, taxonomical and environmental unevennesses were pervasive in management cost reporting, dominated by spending in North America and Oceania, and towards well-studied taxonomic groups such as insects, plants, birds and mammals (Pyšek et al., 2008). Models indicated that greater damages caused significantly higher total management spending through time, with current management delays having caused additional costs of $1247.2 billion at the global scale. Overall damage and management costs have been rising rapidly through time; a trend that is unlikely to abate in the future given the growing rates of biological invasions that could cause correspondingly higher economic impacts (Seebens et al., 2021).Management costs for IAS have totalled at least $95.3 billion worldwide in the last 60 years , and are potentially as high as $307.9 billionat least one order of magnitude lower than damage costs over the same period ($1130.6 billion to $5118.6 billion).

        <p>Our results showed that damage costs not only largely outweigh management costs overall, but also that within management expenditures, proactive, pre-invasion management investments are much lower than reactive, post-invasion expenditures. Relatively low levels of proactive investment may be interpreted in two, potentially non-exclusive waysdepending on the success of these management actions. On the one hand, this result might reveal cost-efficient preventive actions so far, confirming that prevention is better and cheaper than 'cure' regarding biological invasions (Leung et al., 2002). This is further supported by management having three-times more expanded database entries than damage, but 12-times lower cost, indicating that management is generally cheaper than damage incurred. While this explanation remains broadly true (as efficient prevention measures mitigate further impacts from established invaders and their associated costs), it could not serve as a stand-alone reason for the low preinvasion investment observed here, given the (i) known greater increase in damage costs compared to management spending, (ii) observed delays to management actions and (iii) ever-increasing ecological and health impacts of invaders globally (Pyšek et al., 2020). On the other hand, investments are typically most commonly made only when IAS-associated impacts become noticeable in colonised or otherwise protected areas, i.e. often when invaders are already well-established and their impacts are high and hard to minimise (Simberloff et al., 2013). Indeed, the average minimum management delay after reported damages was substantial (11 years), suggesting a sparsity of timely investment globally that has accrued substantial costs of inaction at the trillion-$ scale.Our results showed that damage costs not only largely outweigh management costs overall, but also that within management expenditures, proactive, pre-invasion management investments are much lower than reactive, post-invasion expenditures.

        <p>Examples of marked and sustained late-stage expenditures that would have benefited from earlier management interventions are legion (Supplementary Material 7). These examples have each borne substantial postinvasion costs, which could have been mitigated by effective prevention or rapid response measures (Ahmed et al., 2021). Conversely, there are examples of sound proactive management to minimise economic costs of invasions, as well as sanitary and ecological ones (Supplementary Material 7). Customs interceptions of insects in Australia, New Zealand and the US are a good illustration of efficient structures that would gain in being adopted elsewhere (McCullough et al., 2006;Turner et al., 2021). These services deal with large lists of potential invaders with only marginal costs for each additional species (Lougheed, 2007). As an example, interceptions as well as surveillance and early reaction protocols in New Zealand have allowed the identification and removal of several established colonies of red imported fire ants (S. invicta) over the last two decades (Ward, 2009). The first one, near Auckland airport, was managed for a cost of about 1.4 million NZ dollars, when if let to establish, its damage cost would have been at least 318 million per year (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2001).

The first one, near Auckland airport, was managed for a cost of about 1.4 million NZ dollars, when if let to establish, its damage cost would have been at least 318 million per year (Convention on Biological Diversity, 2001). Invasions of this species now cost billions of dollars both in the US and in Australia (Angulo et al., 2021b). This proactive Fig. 6.

        <p>Aside from a few examples, the large discrepancy in expenditure across different stages of invasion is worrisome considering the budgetary constraints conservation managers face. Moreover, post-invasion management costs could arguably be added to the high costs of damages and losses as these impacts would have been avoided if their introduction/establishment had been successfully prevented. Concerningly, the cost differential between pre-and post-invasion management is often greatest in the Global South. In these regions, this trend could reflect the particularly limited budgets and hence capacity to manage proactively, with investments instead made reactively following impact detection. These trends and pre-post discrepancies held even when considering unfiltered (i.e. including low reliability and potential) costs. Nevertheless, there are some promising trends at the global scale, whereby pre-invasion investment and knowledge funding spending were increasing at a faster rate than post-invasion management between the 1980s and 1990salbeit at a lower magnitude and unequally among regionsas well as reductions in management delays towards recent years.Aside from a few examples, the large discrepancy in expenditure across different stages of invasion is worrisome considering the budgetary constraints conservation managers face.

        <p>Another pattern in our results is that at least two thirds of expendituresparticularly those at pre-invasion stageswere reported at the country scale or lower. Recent regulations and mandates have required countries to prevent, control and eradicate selected IAS and act collectively to achieve this, e.g. European Union Regulation 1143/2014 on IAS (EU, 2014); European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation prioritisation for invasive alien plant species (Branquart et al., 2016). However, such cross-country initiatives are absent in many parts of the world. It has been well-demonstrated that biological invasions are a transboundary problem, and that concerted actions at regional scales improve efficiency and reduce overall expenditures (Faulkner et al., 2020). Therefore, not only should more be spent on biosecurity, but monetary resources need to be utilised strategically by considering broad-scale invasion pathways wherever possible (Turbelin et al., 2021). As the number of problematic IAS is positively correlated with the total number of established aliens (Ricciardi and Kipp, 2008), effective pre-invasion management will reduce the number of future problematic IAS, and therefore post-invasion management and damage costs (Early et al., 2016).Another pattern in our results is that at least two thirds of expendituresparticularly those at pre-invasion stageswere reported at the country scale or lower.

        <p>Stark geographic and taxonomic unevennesses were evidenced in the expenditure results of the present study. This is not particularly surprising as they largely reflect general biases in invasion research previously shown (Pyšek et al., 2008;Jeschke et al., 2012;Bellard and Jeschke, 2015). North America had by far the greatest pre-invasion management expenditure, and this might reflect relatively early efforts to report synthesised invasion costs in countries such as the US (Pimentel et al., 2000), which potentially promoted action in the following decades, during which proactive management has grown rapidly. Differences in damage and management expenditure data entries and costs among regions (e.g. North America vs. Africa) could additionally be linked to the different economic capacities of the countries, invasion histories, conservation priorities, levels of public awareness, socio-cultural differences and conflicting priorities, and differences in sectors affected, among other factors (Paini et al., 2016;Diagne et al., 2021a). They could also reflect language barriers, with the InvaCost database capturing costs in 'only' 22 languages, e.g. missing many African and Asian ones (Angulo et al., 2021a). In addition, it is worth noting that the significant difference in price levels between areas (e.g. labour costs for similar management actions are likely cheaper in most African countries when compared with those in Europe or North America) may contribute to discrepancies in reported costs among regions. Further monetary comparisons at the macroeconomic scale should require reliance on indicators such as the purchasing power parity, which are still prevented by very limited information for most countries and/or years from official sources such as the World Bank (Diagne et al., 2020b).Stark geographic and taxonomic unevennesses were evidenced in the expenditure results of the present study.

        <p>At the taxonomic level, post-invasion management dominated for all taxa, but vertebrates received the highest reported pre-invasion spending. However, scrutinising the data at hand reveals that this was mainly due to a single surveillance programme for multiple invasive fish species in Mexico, with this single report driving the trend towards aquatic vertebrates with respect to pre-invasion spending (Diagne et al., 2020b;Rico-Sánchez et al., 2021;doi:https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare. 12668570). While further highlighting the value of non-English data sources (Angulo et al., 2021a), this Mexican fisheries example shows the patchy nature of the available reported spending data, resulting in costs for a single group of species in a specific place and time driving largescale patterns and potentially obscuring true data gaps or trends. This case also highlights a likely substantial underestimation of the global management cost, when considering all taxonomic groups and geographic regions which are targeted by managers. Nevertheless, the fact that biosecurity investments are often recorded for multiple species in our data may reflect a 'broad-sweeping' approach that targets multiple aliens simultaneously. Such approaches could include taking pathway-level actions, such as indiscriminate airport checking and ballast water treatment (Lougheed, 2007;Lin et al., 2020), or area-level approaches (e.g. protected areas and islands; Rico-Sánchez et al., 2021). Regardless, most investments across all management types have been towards terrestrial IAS, likely the result of human assets and economic activities being predominantly terrestrial and certainly most visible in this realm (Menge et al., 2009), and this aligns with similar unevenness in cost reporting across biomes (Cuthbert et al., 2021).At the taxonomic level, post-invasion management dominated for all taxa, but vertebrates received the highest reported pre-invasion spending.

        <p>Research efforts have also been biased towards structurally larger taxa, whereas the effects (and even biogeography) of smaller and less wellresolved taxa (e.g. fungi, chromists, bacteria) often remain unclear (Cuthbert et al., 2022a). This reflects a broader trend within invasion biology, whereby research effort is positively related to the size of study biota (i.e. "smalls rule"; Carlton, 2009). Relatedly, we found very few management costs directly attributable to taxonomic groups often comprising small species (e.g. fungi, chromists). Nevertheless, a large overall proportion of costs were for diverse or unspecified taxa (i.e. $39.9 billion at the phylum level), indicating poor reporting resolution that could hamper the directing of future management efforts. Where resolution in reporting reached the species level, our study showed management concentrated on animals, but that a different suite of taxa received a focus for pre-invasion as opposed to post-invasion management, or caused the greatest damage costs. This difference between targeted species may be an artefact of effective prevention, disparate reporting, different damages among regions, or it may indicate that societies are not sufficiently investing in spreadprevention of species already documented to be damaging invaders elsewhere (i.e. the precautionary principle; Simberloff et al., 2013).Research efforts have also been biased towards structurally larger taxa, whereas the effects (and even biogeography) of smaller and less wellresolved taxa (e.g. fungi, chromists, bacteria) often remain unclear (Cuthbert et al., 2022a).

        <p>Our work allowed us to identify a number of knowledge gaps as well as avenues for further improvements, for both research and applied purposes (summarised in Table 1). Importantly, we are aware that the trends and patterns in InvaCost only reflect a sample of the true costs at the time of writing this paper. Our work should therefore be considered as a baseline that will need to be updated and improved as new cost information is both generated and collated in this living database. The suite of data available is highly uneven and changing rapidly, with temporal trends showing a significant increase in the number of cost-reporting documents available over time (Haubrock et al., 2022), paralleling increasing cost magnitudes and invasion rates (Seebens et al., 2017), and diversifying impacts. Particularly, as IAS can remain undetected for several decades before their impacts start becoming apparent (Essl et al., 2011), future invasions could implicate a new suite of geographic origins, activity sectors, taxonomic groups and habitats that require different management approaches than those applied today. Estimation and reporting of cost data should be substantially improved and homogenised in the future to further identify trends in economic impacts and direct management actions (Diagne et al., 2020a(Diagne et al., , 2021a)). It is also critical that a better balance of cost reporting is achieved across spatial, taxonomic and sectoral scales, given gaps in the available data (Table 1).Our work allowed us to identify a number of knowledge gaps as well as avenues for further improvements, for both research and applied purposes (summarised in Table 1).

        <p>Our study allowed us to identify three additional, specific areas where further improvement will be instrumental. First, there are many ambiguities and subjectivities created by the definitions used for management terms in the literature. As an illustration, the terms "monitoring" and "control" are often used either at both early-stages (e.g. to reduce opportunities for introduction of invaders) or at late-stages (e.g. to check or reduce population abundances) of the invasion process. Relatedly, terminology used to report impacts from IAS may be inconsistent among fields. For example, agricultural and public health sectors frequently refer to "pest species" without specifically differentiating IAS, or even IAS from native species, within this terminology, despite increasingly large proportions of managed species being IAS. As a result, a large number of costs of IAS may be missed from the literature (e.g. the case of rodents, Diagne et al., 2021c). We therefore advocate for future work to adopt a consistent framework for estimating and reporting different management expenditures dedicated to invasions (see Robertson et al., 2020).Our study allowed us to identify three additional, specific areas where further improvement will be instrumental.

        <p>Second, while "mixed" management costs (an unattributable combination of pre-and post-invasion management, or mixed with knowledge funding) formed a significant proportion (11%) of the expanded cost entries in the filtered dataset, a number of cost entries (n = 124) were not retained due to their classification as "unspecified" (i.e. it was not possible to identify and classify any specific actions taken with respect to the stage at which they occurred). Moreover, costs that were mixed between "damage" and "management" were excluded entirely because it was not possible to reliably distinguish and split the expenditure reported into specific categories. Similarly, economic valuation approaches to invasions are not always complete, with expenditures such as labour costs being implicit or simply overlooked (Born et al., 2005), or other opportunity costs (i.e. the value of another use of the management resource) also often not included in monetary estimates. Indeed, the inclusion of labour costs can rapidly result in differences of orders of magnitude in cost estimations to single sectors (e.g. Diagne et al., 2021bvs. Eschen et al., 2021). This highlights that clearer and more comprehensive breakdowns of cost reporting across types and contexts would increase the value of such data instead of aggregated total expenditures. Moreover, the management of IAS can raise a number of conflicts, including those arising from opposing economic interests and insufficient communication among resource managers, policymakers, natural and social scientists, and the public (Andreu et al., 2009;Crowley et al., 2017;de Groot et al., 2020;Kourantidou et al., 2022). In economic systems where IAS impacts are not necessarily caused and incurred by the same actors, understanding the nature of past management investments provides important evidence to inform discussion across all stakeholders. For this purpose, cross-sectoral efforts within and among scientists, decision-makers and stakeholders are needed to gather more specific and detailed information, potentially helping to balance cost reporting unevenness (Courchamp et al., 2017;Vaz et al., 2017). In turn, such concerted efforts may facilitate the implementation of context-adapted policies and management measures at appropriate scales (Novoa et al., 2018).Second, while "mixed" management costs (an unattributable combination of pre-and post-invasion management, or mixed with knowledge funding) formed a significant proportion (11%) of the expanded cost entries in the filtered dataset, a number of cost entries (n = 124) were not retained due to their classification as "unspecified" (i.e. it was not possible to identify and classify any specific actions taken with respect to the stage at which they occurred).

        <p>Third, we do not have an adequate understanding of the outcomes (failure or success) of the reported management actions for which costs are currently reported. There is accordingly an urgent need to formalise an international repository for management actions (their costs and successfulness) to collate data and get a clearer picture of the ratio between investment and success. Doing so may guide further actions in other places where the same IAS is expected to invade and provide a concrete, quantitative incentive to invest in proactive management. In doing so, we can build not only an account of how much has been spent (i.e. management effort), but also where the spending has been most efficient. This can therefore potentially identify which taxa should be targeted using which approaches, as currently it is not possible for any species to determine management efficiencies.Third, we do not have an adequate understanding of the outcomes (failure or success) of the reported management actions for which costs are currently reported.

        <p>Total management spending was significantly positively related to damage costs, pre-invasion spending and numbers of references in the present study. The positive relationship between management spending and references reporting expenditure intuitively suggests that greater efforts to research and report costs result in higher observed costs. However, recent studies have shown that costs are rising at a faster rate than references which report them, indicating that rising costs are not only due to reporting dynamics (Haubrock et al., 2022). Therefore, damage costs and postinvasion spending are likely growing substantially faster than preinvasion investment, independently from reporting efforts. Positive relationships among cost types also suggest countries that report high costs in one area are more likely to report high costs in another, perhaps simply due to better cost reporting capabilities. Further, there could be a specieslevel effect, where species with very high damages are likely to be managed intensely at all stages of the invasion, thus causing a positive relationship between management cost types and damage costs. These processes would each act to mask any negative relationship between pre-invasion management spending and total damage or total management costs.Total management spending was significantly positively related to damage costs, pre-invasion spending and numbers of references in the present study.

        <p>Nevertheless, recent mathematical modelling approaches, based on the invasion process, have been developed to quantify the cost of inaction and motivate proactive management, incorporating management efficiency (Ahmed et al., 2021). However, this inaction model was fit assuming that global cost records reflected a system without management delays. If we instead simulate the impact of our mean global management delay across species and countries, the average management delay of 10.7 years was found to have caused an additional cost of $1247.2 billion compared to a scenario with immediate management. Although management costs were initially reported in the year 1960, this was for a relatively small number of species (4 from a total of 366 species and country combinations). Species and country-specific delay times are centrally distributed around the mean time delay of 10.7 years, and this provides a more accurate representation of the time of management introduction at the global level (Supplementary Material 3). Moreover, had management actions never occurred, inaction costs in excess of $3423.6 billion would have accrued to the present day. Although coarsely modelled at the global scale considering that management spending was pooled across species and countries that had significantly varied delay times (Supplementary Material 3), this very concretely illustrates The InvaCost database has allowed the launch of several dozen projects to better inform on the economic costs of biological invasions worldwide and provides a 'living' platform for cost reporting (Diagne et al., 2020b). b The framework proposed by Robertson et al.

        <p>the benefits of proactively managing biological invasions. Indeed, modest initial investments circumvented massive future costseach $1 of management was estimated to reduce damages by $53.5 in this study. The fact that this model provides estimates of total expenditure ($1449.4 billion in realised damage plus management costs) that are commensurate with other global cost estimates imparts additional confidence in our parameterisation. For example, total reported costs of invasions were found to have reached a minimum of $1.3 trillion globally (Diagne et al., 2021a), and later with an improved estimate of $1.5 trillion considering additional non-English sources (Angulo et al., 2021a).the benefits of proactively managing biological invasions.

        <p>There is also a broader human nature and morality argument to IAS management, whereby it is difficult to motivate proactive investment given intrinsic inclinations to react where impact becomes apparent. In particular, it is difficult to convey a need to invest to decision-makers when impacts are seemingly absent in the short-term, incurred by other sectors or in different regions, and when other demands on limited funds may seem more pressing. In addition, efficient proactive management will prevent any impact, paradoxically removing concrete reasons for said management. Drawing parallels to motivations for climate action, IAS management represents another "perfect moral storm", whereby more emphasis should be placed on urging decision-makers to act collectively and proactively to solve a growing global and intergenerational problem (Gardiner, 2006).There is also a broader human nature and morality argument to IAS management, whereby it is difficult to motivate proactive investment given intrinsic inclinations to react where impact becomes apparent.
