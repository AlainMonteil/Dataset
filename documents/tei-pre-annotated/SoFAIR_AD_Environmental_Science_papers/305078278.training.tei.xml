        <p>Structurally intact tropical forests sequestered ~50% of global terrestrial carbon uptake over the 1990s and early 2000s, removing ~15% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions [1][2][3] . Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest 'carbon sink' will continue for decades 4,5 . Here, we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, we compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 (95% CI:0.53-0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests 6 . Thus, the carbon sink responses of Earth's two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric CO2 and air temperature [7][8][9] . Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our data suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including CO2, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, while the Amazonian sink continues to rapidly weaken. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth's intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern hemisphere landmass 10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already saturated. This tropical forest sink saturation and ongoing decline has consequences for policies to stabilise Earth's climate.Structurally intact tropical forests sequestered ~50% of global terrestrial carbon uptake over the 1990s and early 2000s, removing ~15% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions [1][2][3] .

        <p>Tropical forests account for approximately one-third of Earth's terrestrial Gross Primary Productivity and one-half of Earth's carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation 11 . Thus, small biome-wide changes in tree growth and mortality can have global impacts, either buffering or exacerbating the increase in atmospheric CO2. Models 2,4,5,7,12 , ground-based observations [13][14][15] , airborne atmospheric CO2 measurements 3,16 , inferences from remotely sensed data 17 , and synthetic approaches 3,8,18 each suggest that, after accounting for land-use change, remaining structurally intact tropical forests (i.e. not impacted by direct anthropogenic impacts such as logging) are increasing in carbon stocks. This structurally intact tropical forest carbon sink is estimated at ~1.2 Pg C yr -1 over 1990-2007 using scaled inventory plot measurements 1 . Yet, despite its policy relevance, changes in this key carbon sink remain highly uncertain 19,20 .Tropical forests account for approximately one-third of Earth's terrestrial Gross Primary Productivity and one-half of Earth's carbon stored in terrestrial vegetation 11 .

        <p>Globally the terrestrial carbon sink is increasing 2,7,8,21 . Between 1990 and 2017 the land surface sequestered ~30% of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions 1,21 . Rising CO2 concentrations are thought to have boosted photosynthesis more than rising air temperatures have enhanced respiration, resulting in an increasing global terrestrial carbon sink 2,4,7,8,21 . Yet, for Amazonia, recent results from repeated censuses of intact forest inventory plots show a progressive two-decade decline in sink strength primarily due to an increase of carbon losses from tree mortality 6 . It is unclear if this simply reflects region-specific drought impacts 22,23 , or potentially chronic pan-tropical impacts of either heat-related tree mortality 24,25 , or internal forest dynamics resulting from past increases in carbon gains leaving the system 26 . A more recent deceleration of the rate of increase in carbon gains from tree growth is also contributing to the declining Amazon sink 6 . Again, it is not known if this is a result of either pan-tropical CO2 fertilisation saturation, or rising air temperatures, or is merely a regional drought impact. To address these uncertainties, we (i) analyze an unprecedented long-term inventory dataset from Africa, (ii) pool the new African and existing Amazonian records to investigate the putative environmental drivers of changes in the tropical forest carbon sink, and (iii) project its likely future evolution.Globally the terrestrial carbon sink is increasing 2,7,8,21 .

        <p>We collected, compiled and analysed data from structurally intact old-growth forests from the African Tropical Rainforest Observation Network 27 (217 plots) and other sources (27 plots) spanning the period 1968 to 2015 (Extended Data Figure 1; Supplementary Table 1). In each plot (mean size, 1.1 ha), all trees ≥100 mm in stem diameter were identified, mapped and measured at least twice using standardised methods (135,625 trees monitored). Live biomass carbon stocks were estimated for each census date, with carbon gains and losses calculated for each interval (Extended Data Figure 2).We collected, compiled and analysed data from structurally intact old-growth forests from the African Tropical Rainforest Observation Network 27 (217 plots) and other sources (27 plots) spanning the period 1968 to 2015 (Extended Data Figure 1; Supplementary Table 1).

        <p>We detect no long-term trend in the per unit area African tropical forest carbon sink over three decades to 2015 (Figure 1). The aboveground live biomass sink averaged 0.66 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 (95% CI: 0.53-0.79; n=244) and was significantly greater than zero for every year since 1990 (Figure 1).We detect no long-term trend in the per unit area African tropical forest carbon sink over three decades to 2015 (Figure 1).

        <p>While very similar to past reports (0.63 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ) 13 , this first estimate of the temporal trend in Africa contrasts with the declining Amazonian trend 6 (Figure 1). A linear mixed effect model shows a significant difference in the slopes of the sink trends for the two continents over the common time window (pooled data from both continents, common time window, 1983-2011.5; p=0.017). Thus, the per unit area sink strength of the two largest expanses of tropical forest on Earth diverged in the 1990s and 2000s.While very similar to past reports (0.63 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ) 13 , this first estimate of the temporal trend in Africa contrasts with the declining Amazonian trend 6 (Figure 1).

        <p>The proximal cause of the divergent sink patterns is a significant increase in carbon losses (from tree mortality, i.e. the loss of carbon from the live biomass pool) in Amazonian forests, with no detectable trend over three decades in African forests (Figure 1). A linear mixed effects model using pooled data shows a significant difference in slopes of carbon losses between the two continents over the common 1983-2011.5 time window (p=0.027). Long-term trends in carbon gains (from tree growth and newly recruited trees) on both continents show significant increases (Figure 1), and we could detect no difference in slopes between the continents (p=0.348; carbon gains from tree growth alone also show no continental difference in long-term trends, p=0.322). However, an assessment of how underlying environmental drivers affect carbon gains and losses is needed to understand the ultimate causes of the divergent sink patterns.The proximal cause of the divergent sink patterns is a significant increase in carbon losses (from tree mortality, i.e. the loss of carbon from the live biomass pool) in Amazonian forests, with no detectable trend over three decades in African forests (Figure 1).

        <p>We first investigate environmental drivers exhibiting long-term change that impact theory-driven models of photosynthesis and respiration: atmospheric CO2 concentration, surface air temperature, and water availability. A linear mixed effects model of carbon gains, with censuses nested within plots, and pooling the new African and published Amazonian data, shows a significant positive relationship with CO2, and significant negative relationships with mean annual temperature (MAT) and drought (measured as the Maximum Climatological Water Deficit, MCWD 14 ; Figure 2; Extended Data Table 1). These results are consistent with a positive CO2 fertilisation effect, and negative effects of higher temperatures and drought on tree growth, consistent with temperaturedependent increases in autotrophic respiration, and temperature-and drought-dependent reductions in carbon assimilation. By contrast, the equivalent model for carbon losses (i.e. tree mortality) shows no significant relationships with CO2, MAT or MCWD (Figure 2; Extended Data Table 1).We first investigate environmental drivers exhibiting long-term change that impact theory-driven models of photosynthesis and respiration: atmospheric CO2 concentration, surface air temperature, and water availability.

        <p>We further investigate the responses of carbon gains and losses (for which the above analysis has no explanatory power) by expanding our potential explanatory variables to additionally include the change in environmental conditions (CO2-change, MAT-change, MCWD-change, see Extended Data Figure 3 for calculation details), and two attributes of forests that may influence their response to the same environmental change: plot mean wood density (which in old-growth forests correlates with below-ground resource availability 28,29 ), and the plot carbon residence time (which measures how long fixed carbon remains in the system, hence dictates when past increases in carbon gains leave the system as elevated carbon losses 30 ).We further investigate the responses of carbon gains and losses (for which the above analysis has no explanatory power) by expanding our potential explanatory variables to additionally include the change in environmental conditions (CO2-change, MAT-change, MCWD-change, see Extended Data Figure 3 for calculation details), and two attributes of forests that may influence their response to the same environmental change: plot mean wood density (which in old-growth forests correlates with below-ground resource availability 28,29 ), and the plot carbon residence time (which measures how long fixed carbon remains in the system, hence dictates when past increases in carbon gains leave the system as elevated carbon losses 30 ).</p>
        <p>The minimum adequate carbon gain model using our expanded explanatory variables (best ranked model using multimodel inference) has a positive relationship with CO2-change, and negative relationships with MAT, MAT-change, MCWD, and wood density (Table 2; model-average results are similar, see Methods and Supplementary Tables 234). The retention of both MAT and MATchange suggests that higher temperatures correspond to lower tree growth, and that trees only partially acclimate to recently rising temperatures, which further reduces growth, consistent with warming experiments 31 and observations 9 . The inclusion of higher wood density, and it being related to lower carbon gains (Extended Data Figure 4), alongside no temporal trends in wood density (Extended Data Figure 5), suggests that old-growth forests with denser-wooded tree communities typically have fewer available below-ground resources, or such patterns may also emerge from disturbance regimes lacking large-scale exogenous events, consistent with prior studies 26,28,32 .The minimum adequate carbon gain model using our expanded explanatory variables (best ranked model using multimodel inference) has a positive relationship with CO2-change, and negative relationships with MAT, MAT-change, MCWD, and wood density (Table 2; model-average results are similar, see Methods and Supplementary Tables 234).

        <p>The minimum adequate carbon gain model using our expanded explanatory variables also highlights continental differences. Between 2000 and 2015 African forest carbon gains increased by 3.1% compared with a 0.1% decline in Amazonia over the same interval (Table 2). In Africa, from 2000 to 2015, the increase was composed of a 3.7% increase from CO2-change, partially offset by increasing droughts depleting gains by 0.5%, and only a slight decline in gains of 0.1% resulting from temperature increases (Table 2), because the rate of temperature change (MAT-change) decelerated over this time window (Extended Data Figure 5). For Amazonia, the same 3.7% increase due to CO2-change was seen, while increasing droughts-and these forests' greater sensitivity to droughtreduced gains by 2.7% (five times the impact in Africa), and temperature increases at the same rate as in the past (i.e. MAT-change is zero) further reduced gains by 1.1% (ten times the impact in Africa), leaving a net change in gains slightly below zero (Table 2). Thus, the recent stalling of carbon gain increases in Amazonia 6 is a response to drought and temperature and not due to an unexpected saturation of CO2 fertilisation. Overall, the larger modelled increase in gains in Africa relative to Amazonia appear to be driven by slower warming, fewer or less extreme droughts, lower forest sensitivity to droughts, and overall lower temperatures (African forests are on average ~1.1°C cooler than Amazonian forests, as they typically grow at ~200 m higher elevation). Other continental differences may also be influencing the results, including higher nitrogen deposition in African tropical forests due to the seasonal burning of nearby savannas 33 and biogeographic history resulting in differing contemporary species pools and resulting functional attributes 34,35 .The minimum adequate carbon gain model using our expanded explanatory variables also highlights continental differences.

        <p>The minimum adequate carbon loss model using our expanded explanatory variables shows higher losses with CO2-change and MAT-change, and lower losses with MCWD and the carbon residence time (CRT; Table 2). Thus, changes in carbon losses appear to be largely a function of carbon gains.The minimum adequate carbon loss model using our expanded explanatory variables shows higher losses with CO2-change and MAT-change, and lower losses with MCWD and the carbon residence time (CRT; Table 2).

        <p>First, the greater losses in forests with shorter CRT conform to a 'high-gain high-loss' forest dynamics pattern 26 . Second, wetter plots have a longer growing season and so have higher gains and correspondingly higher losses, explaining the negative relationship with MCWD. Third, as increasing CO2 levels result in additional carbon gains, after some time these additional past gains leave the system resulting in greater carbon losses, explaining the positive relationship with CO2change. Finally, in addition to these relationships with carbon gains, the inclusion of MAT-change (p&lt;0.001) indicates heat-or vapour pressure deficit-induced tree mortality 24 . Overall, our results imply that chronic long-term environmental change factors, temperature and CO2, rather than simply the direct effects of drought, underlie longer-term trends in tropical forest tree mortality, although other changes such as rising liana infestation rates seen in Amazonia 36,37 cannot be excluded.First, the greater losses in forests with shorter CRT conform to a 'high-gain high-loss' forest dynamics pattern 26 .

        <p>The minimum adequate carbon loss model using our expanded explanatory variables replicates the continental trends (Figure 3). The overall lower loss rates in Africa reflect their longer CRT (69 yrs, 95% CI, 66-72), compared with Amazonian forests (56 yrs, 95% CI, 54-59) while over the 2000-2015 window the much smaller increase in loss rates in Africa compared to Amazonia results from a slower increase in warming and a stable CRT in Africa compared to continued warming at previous rates and a shortening CRT in Amazonian forests (Extended Data Figure 5). Furthermore, given that losses appear to lag behind gains they should relate to the long-term CRT of plots. This is what we find: the longer the CRT the smaller the increase in carbon losses, with no increase in losses for plots with CRT ≥77 years (Extended Data Figure 6). Consequently, due to the typically longer residence times of African forests, increasing losses in Africa ought to appear 10-15 years after the increase in Amazon losses began (c.1995). Strikingly, in Africa the most intensely monitored plots suggest that losses began increasing from c.2010 (Extended Data Figure 7), and plots with shorter CRT are driving the increase (Extended Data Figure 8). Thus, a mortality-dominated African carbon sink decline appears to have begun very recently.The minimum adequate carbon loss model using our expanded explanatory variables replicates the continental trends (Figure 3).

        <p>Our carbon gain and loss models (Table 2) can be used to make a tentative estimate of the future size of the per unit area intact forest carbon sink (Figure 3). Extrapolations of the changes in the predictor variables from 1983-2015 forward to 2040 (Extended Data Figure 5) show declines in the sink on both continents (Figure 3). By 2030 the carbon sink in aboveground live biomass in intact African tropical forest is predicted to decline by 14% from the measured 2010-15 mean, to 0.57 Mg C ha -1 yr - range, 2011-2089; Figure 3). Our estimated sink strength on both continents in the 2020s and 2030s is sensitive to future CO2 emissions pathways (CO2-change) 38 , resulting temperature increase (MAT, MAT-change) and hydrological changes (MCWD), plus changes in forest dynamics (CRT), but the sink is always lower than levels seen in the 2000s (see Methods and Supplementary Table 5). Thus, the carbon sink strength of the world's two most extensive tropical forests have now saturated, albeit asynchronously.Our carbon gain and loss models (Table 2) can be used to make a tentative estimate of the future size of the per unit area intact forest carbon sink (Figure 3).

        <p>Scaling our estimated mean sink strength by forest area for each continent signifies that Earth recently passed the point of peak carbon sequestration into intact tropical forests (Table 1). The continental sink in Amazonia peaked in the 1990s, followed by a decline, driven by sink strength peaking in the 1990s and a continued decline in forest area (Table 1). In Africa the per unit area sink strength peaked later in the 2000-2010 period, but the continental African sink peaked in the 1990s, due to the decline in forest area in the 2000s outpacing the small per unit area increase in sink strength. Including the modest uptake in the much smaller area of intact Asian tropical forest indicates that total pan-tropical carbon uptake peaked in the 1990s (Table 1). From peak pan-tropical intact forest uptake of 1.26 Pg C yr -1 in the 1990s, we project a continued decline reaching just 0.29 Pg C yr -1 in the 2030s (multi-decade decline of ~0.24 Pg C yr -1 decade -1 ), driven by (i) reduced mean pan-tropical sink strength decline of 0.1 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 decade -1 and (ii) ongoing forest area losses of ~13.5 million ha yr -1 (see Extended Data Table 2 for forest area details).

        <p>Decomposition of this dead tree mass is ~50% in 4 yrs, and ~85% in 10 yrs, thus rising carbon losses result in delayed carbon additions to the atmosphere 45 . Hence, from an atmospheric perspective the intact tropical forest biomass carbon sink likely peaked a few years later than our plot data indicate and the full impacts are not yet realised. The pan-tropical carbon sink in live biomass reduced by 0.27 Pg C yr -1 between the 1990s and 2000s (Table 1), but accounting for dead wood decomposition 45 shows a smaller 0.17 Pg C yr -1 reduction from an atmospheric perspective (see Methods).Decomposition of this dead tree mass is ~50% in 4 yrs, and ~85% in 10 yrs, thus rising carbon losses result in delayed carbon additions to the atmosphere 45 .

        <p>Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, a weakening intact tropical forest sink implies that the extra-tropical carbon sink has increased over the past two decades. Independent observations of inter-hemispheric atmospheric CO2 concentration indicates that carbon uptake into the Northern hemisphere landmass has increased at a greater rate than the global terrestrial carbon sink since the 1990s, with a further disproportionate increase in the 2000s 10 . The inter-hemispheric analysis suggests a weakening of the tropical forest sink by ~0.2 Pg C yr -1 between the 1990s and 2000s 10 , which is similar to the 0.17 Pg C yr -1 weakening over the same time period that we find. This reinforces our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already saturated.Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, a weakening intact tropical forest sink implies that the extra-tropical carbon sink has increased over the past two decades.

        <p>In summary, our results indicate that while intact tropical forests remain major stores of carbon and are key centres of biodiversity 11 , their ability to sequester additional carbon is waning. In the 1990s intact forests removed 17% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This has declined to 6% in the 2010s, because the pan-tropical weighted average per unit area sink strength declined by 33%, forest area decreased by 19%, and CO2 emissions increased by 46%. Although tropical forests are more immediately threatened by deforestation 46 and degradation 47 , and the future carbon balance will also depend on secondary forest dynamics 48 and forest restoration plans 49 , our analyses show that they are also impacted by atmospheric chemistry and climatic changes. Given that the intact tropical forest carbon sink is set to end sooner than even the most pessimistic climate-driven vegetation models predict 4,5 , our analyses suggest that climate change impacts in the tropics may become more severe than predicted. Furthermore, the carbon balance of intact tropical forests will only stabilise once CO2 concentrations and the climate stabilises.In summary, our results indicate that while intact tropical forests remain major stores of carbon and are key centres of biodiversity 11 , their ability to sequester additional carbon is waning.

Only trees where the top was visible were selected 66 . In most plots, tree selection was similar: the 10 largest trees were measured, together with 10 randomly selected trees per diameter from five classes: 100-199 mm, 200-299 mm, 300-399 mm, 400-499 mm, and 500+ mm trees, following standard protocols 66 .

Each individual in the tree inventory database was matched to a species-specific mean wood density value. Species in both the tree inventory and wood density databases were standardized for orthography and synonymy using the African Plants Database (www.ville-ge.ch/cjb/bd/africa/) to maximize matches 13 . For incompletely identified individuals or for individuals belonging to species not in the ρ database, we used the mean ρ value for the next higher known taxonomic category (genus or family, as appropriate).

        <p>The estimated mean and uncertainty in carbon gains, carbon losses and the net carbon sink of the African plots from 1983-2014 (Figure 1, Extended Data Figure 7 and Extended Data Figure 8) were calculated following ref. 6 to allow direct comparison with published Amazonian results. First, each census interval value was interpolated for each 0.1-yr period within the census interval. Then, for each 0.1-yr period between 1983 and 2014, we calculated a weighted mean of all plots monitored at that time, using the square root of plot area as a weighting factor 6 . Confidence intervals for each 0.1yr period were bootstrapped.The estimated mean and uncertainty in carbon gains, carbon losses and the net carbon sink of the African plots from 1983-2014 (Figure 1, Extended Data Figure 7 and Extended Data Figure 8) were calculated following ref. 6 to allow direct comparison with published Amazonian results.

        <p>Differences in long-term slopes between the two continents for carbon gains, carbon losses and net carbon sink, reported in the main text, were also assessed using linear mixed effects models, as described above, but performed on the combined African and Amazonian datasets and limited to their common time window, 1983 to 2011.5. For these three tests on the pooled data we included an additional interaction term between census interval date and continent, where a significant interaction would indicate that the slopes differ between continents. The statistical significance of continental differences in slope were assessed using the F-statistic (Anova function in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>, car package 73 ). Shortening the common time window to the 20 years when the continents are bestsampled, 1991.5 to 2011.5, gave very similar results, including a divergent continental sink (p=0.04).

        <p>The per unit area total net carbon sink (in Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ) for each time period in Table 1 (each decade between 1980 and 2010; and 2010-2015) is the sum of three components. The first component is the per unit area aboveground carbon sink from living trees and lianas with DBH≥100 mm. For Africa we use the per unit area net carbon sink values presented in this paper. For Amazonia, we use data in ref. 6 . For Southeast Asia, we use inventory data collected using similar standardised methods from 49 plots in ref. 15 . For each time window, we use all plots for which census dates overlap the period, weighted by the square root of plot area, as for the solid lines in Figure 1.

        <p>To estimate the evolution of the carbon sink from an atmospheric perspective, we assumed that the contribution to the atmosphere from carbon gains are experienced immediately, while the contribution to the atmosphere from carbon losses must take into account the delay in decomposition of dead trees. We did this by calculating total forest carbon loss (Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ) for each year between 1950-2015, using the mean 1983-2015 records from Figure 1 and assuming constant losses prior to 1983 (1.9 and 1.5 Mg C ha -1 yr -1 for Africa and Amazonia respectively). Then, for each focal year between 1950-2015, we calculated how much carbon was released to the atmosphere in the subsequent years as: yt = x0 × e -0.17× (t-1) -x0 × e -0.17× t , where x0 is the total forest carbon loss of the focal year; yt is the carbon released to the atmosphere at t years from the focal year; and -0.17 yr -1 is a constant decomposition rate calculated for tropical forests in the Amazon 45 . For example, carbon loss was 1.95 Mg C ha -1 in 1990 in African forests (Figure 1), from which 0.31 Mg C ha -1 was released to the atmosphere in 1991; 0.26 Mg C ha -1 in 1992; 0.22 Mg C ha -1 in 1993; 0.07 Mg C ha -1 in 2000 and 0.01 Mg C ha -1 in 2010. Hence, of the full 1.95 Mg C ha -1 dead tree biomass from 1990, ~50% was released to the atmosphere after 4 yrs, ~85% after 10 yrs, and ~97% after 20 years.To estimate the evolution of the carbon sink from an atmospheric perspective, we assumed that the contribution to the atmosphere from carbon gains are experienced immediately, while the contribution to the atmosphere from carbon losses must take into account the delay in decomposition of dead trees.

        <p>Finally, for each year between 1983 and 2015, the total contribution to the atmosphere from carbon losses was calculated as the sum of all carbon contributions released at that year, from all total yearly forest carbon loss pools of the previous years.

        <p>For each census interval of each plot, we examined potential predictor variables that may explain the long-term trends in carbon gains and carbon losses, reported in Extended Data Table 1 and main text Table 2. First, the environmental conditions during the census interval; second the rate of change of these parameters; and third forest attributes that may affect how different forests respond to the same environmental change. The predictor variable estimates for each census need to avoid bias due to seasonal variation, for example the intra-annual variability in atmospheric CO2 concentration. We therefore applied the following procedure to avoid seasonal variability impacts on long-term trends:For each census interval of each plot, we examined potential predictor variables that may explain the long-term trends in carbon gains and carbon losses, reported in Extended Data Table 1 and main text Table 2.

The fit for the overlapping time period (1998-2013) was used to correct the systematic difference between GPCC and TRMM: GPCC' = a+b*GPCC, with GPCC' the adjusted GPCC record and a and b different parameters for each month of the year and for each continent.The first group of potential predictor variables, estimated for each census interval of each plot, are theory-driven choices: atmospheric CO2 concentration (CO2), mean annual temperature (MAT), and drought intensity, which we quantified as maximum climatological water deficit (MCWD) 14,20,76,77 . 84 .

Monthly CWD values were calculated for each subsequent series of 12 months (complete years) 77 .

We then calculated the annual MCWD as the largest monthly CWD value for every complete year within the census interval, with maximum response to an integrated 56 years of change is expected because forest stands will respond most strongly to CO2 when most individuals have grown under the new rapidly changing condition, which should be at its maximum at a time approximately equivalent to the carbon residence time of a forest stand 30,90 (mean of 62 years in this dataset). For MAT, 5 years is consistent with experiments showing temperature acclimation of leaf-and plant-level photosynthetic and respiration processes over half-decadal timescales 31,91 . MCWD has no overall trend suggesting that once a drought ends, its impact on tree growth fades rapidly, as seen in other studies 14,92 . Also in the moist tropics wet-season rainfall is expected to re-charge soil water, hence lagged impacts of droughts are not expected.This procedure was repeated for each subsequent complete 12 months.

        <p>We calculated estimates of two forest attributes that may alter responses to environmental change as potential predictor variables: Wood Density (WD) and Carbon Residence Time (CRT). In intact oldgrowth forests, mean WD (in g cm -3 ) is inversely related to resource availability 28,93,94 , as is seen in our dataset (carbon gains and plot-level mean WD are negatively correlated, Extended Data Figure 4). WD is calculated for each census interval in the dataset, as the mean WD of all trees alive at the end of the census interval, to be consistent with the previous Amazon analysis Estimates (above). For WD and CRT we interpolated to a 0.1-yr period within each census interval (as in Figure 1). Then, we calculated the mean annual value of each predictor variable from the 244 plot locations in Africa, and separately the mean annual value of each predictor variable from the 321 plot locations in Amazonia (i.e. solid lines in ED Figure 5). For each predictor variable, we calculated annual records of upper and lower confidence intervals by respectively adding and subtracting 2σ to the mean of each annual value (shaded area in ED Figure 5).We calculated estimates of two forest attributes that may alter responses to environmental change as potential predictor variables: Wood Density (WD) and Carbon Residence Time (CRT).

        <p>Secondly, for each predictor variable we parameterised a linear model for each continent using the annual records for the period of the observed trends. Then for each predictor variable, the continentspecific linear regression models were used to estimate predictor variables for each plot location from 2014 to 2040 in Africa and from 2011.5 to 2040 in the Amazon (dotted lines in Extended Data Figure 5).

        <p>We used the minimum adequate models (Table 2) to predict annual records of carbon gain, carbon loss and the carbon sink for the plot networks in Africa and Amazonia over the period 1983 through to 2040 (Figure 3). We extracted fitted carbon gain and loss values using the mean annual records for each predictor variable (predictSE.lme function, 
            <rs type="software">AICcmodavg</rs> package 
            <rs type="version">100</rs> ). Upper and lower confidence intervals were calculated accounting for uncertainties in the model (both fixed and random effects) and predictor variables using the 2σ upper and lower confidence interval for each predictor variable (using predictSE.lme). Finally the net carbon sink was calculated by subtracting the losses from the gains. To obtain sink values in the future in Table 1, annual per unit area sink predictions, from Figure 3, were averaged over each decade and multiplied by the future forest area, as described above.

For MCWD the AIC minimum is not obvious, while the slope of the correlation, shown in panel (d), shows no overall trend and oscillates between positive or negative values, meaning there is no relationship between carbon gains and the change in MCWD over intervals longer than 1 year; thus MCWD-change is not included in our models.

This is because in Figure 1 we include all available plots over the 1983-2015 window, which includes clusters of plots monitored only in the 2010s that had low carbon loss and high carbon sink values.To test the sensitivity of the future predictions in Figure 3, we reran the analysis by modifying future trajectories of predictor variables one at a time, while keeping all others the same, to assess the mean showing temperature acclimation of leaf-and plant-level photosynthetic and respiration processes over approximately half-decadal timescales 31,91 .

MCWD therefore represents a precipitation-driven dry season deficit, as ET remains constant.

        <p>To calculate the environmental change of potential predictor variables, CO2-change (in ppm yr -1 ), MAT-change (in °C yr -1 ) and MCWD-change (in mm yr -1 ), we selected an optimum period over which to calculate the change, derived empirically by assessing the correlation of carbon gains (all plots, all censuses) with the change in each environmental variable, using linear mixed effects models (lmer function in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">lme4</rs> package 72 ). The annualised change in the environmental variable was calculated as the change between the focal interval and a prior interval (termed the baseline period) with a lengthening time window ranging from 1 year through to 80 years prior to the focal interval (i.e. 80 linear mixed effects models per variable). We calculated AIC for each model and selected the interval length with the lowest AIC. Thus, MAT-change (in °C yr -1 ) = (MATi-MATb)/(datei-dateb), where MATi is the MAT over the focal census interval calculated using the procedure described above, MATb is the MAT over a baseline period prior to the focal interval, datei is the mid-date of the focal census interval and dateb is the mid-date of the baseline period. The lmer results show that the baseline period for MAT-change is 5 years and for CO2-change it is 56 years, while MCWD showed no clear trend, so MCWD-change was not included in the models (see Extended Data Figure 3). All three results conform to a priori theoretical expectations. For CO2 a standard CRT equation (based on losses) used in the carbon gain model is not retained in the minimum adequate model (see below).
        </p>
        <p>We first constructed two models including those environmental drivers exhibiting long-term change that impact theory-driven models of photosynthesis and respiration as predictor variables: CO2, MAT, and MCWD. One model had carbon gains as the response variable, the other had carbon losses as the response variable (both in Mg C ha -1 yr -1 ). Models were fitted using the lme function in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>, with maximum likelihood (NLME package 95 ). All census intervals within all plots were used, weighted by plot size and census length (using equation 3 above). Plot identity was included as a random effect, i.e. assuming that the intercept can vary randomly among plots. All predictor variables in the models were scaled without centering (scale function in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">RASTER</rs> package 62 ).
        </p>
        <p>Carbon gain values were normally distributed but carbon loss values required a power-law transformation (λ= 0.361) to meet normality criteria. Multi-parameter models are: carbon gains = intcp + a×CO2 + b×MAT + c×MCWD (model 1); carbon losses = intcp + a×CO2 + b×MAT + c×MCWD (model 2); where intcp is the estimated model intercept, and a, b, and c are model parameters giving the slope of relationships with environmental predictor variables. For multiparameter model outputs see Extended Data Table 1, for single-parameter relationships, Figure 2.Carbon gain values were normally distributed but carbon loss values required a power-law transformation (λ= 0.361) to meet normality criteria.

        <p>The second pair of models include the same environmental predictors (CO2, MAT, MCWD), plus their rate of change (CO2-change, MAT-change, but not MCWD-change as explained above), and forest attributes that may alter how forests respond (WD, CRT), as described above. We also evaluated the possible inclusion of a differential continent effect of each variable in the full model.The second pair of models include the same environmental predictors (CO2, MAT, MCWD), plus their rate of change (CO2-change, MAT-change, but not MCWD-change as explained above), and forest attributes that may alter how forests respond (WD, CRT), as described above. We also evaluated the possible inclusion of a differential continent effect of each variable in the full model.</p>
        <p>We first constructed models with only a single predictor variable, and allowed different slopes in each continent. Next, if removal of the continent-specific slope (using stepAIC function in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>, 
            <rs type="software">MASS</rs> package 96 ) decreased model Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) then the continent-specific slope was not included in the full model for that variable. Only MCWD showed a significant differential continent-specific slope. This implies that forests on both continents have common responses to CO2, CO2-change, MAT, MAT-change, WD and CRT, but respond differently to differences in MCWD. This is likely because wet-adapted species are much rarer in Africa than in Amazonia as a result of large differences in past climate variation 34 . Lastly, we allowed different intercepts for the two continents to potentially account for differing biogeographical or other continent-specific factors. For the carbon loss model, we applied the same continent-specific effects for slope as for the carbon gain model. Carbon loss values were transformed using a power-law transformation (λ= 0.361) to meet normality criteria.
        </p>
        <p>For both carbon gains and losses we parameterized a global model including the significant continent-specific effect of MCWD, selecting the most parsimonious simplified model using allsubsets regression 97,98 . To do so, we first generated a set of models with all possible combinations (subsets) of fixed effect terms in the global model using the dredge function of the 
            <rs type="software">MuMIn</rs> package in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> 99 . We then chose the best-ranked simplified model based on the AICc criterion, hereafter called "minimum adequate carbon gain/loss model", reported in Table 2. The minimum adequate models are: carbon gains = intcp×continent + a×CO2-change + b×MAT + c×MAT-change + d×MCWD×continent + e×WD (model 3); carbon losses = intcp + a×CO2-change + b×MAT-change + c×MCWD + d×CRT (model 4). WD was retained in the carbon gain model, likely because growth is primarily impacted by resource availability, while CRT was retained in the carbon loss model, likely because losses are primarily impacted by how long fixed carbon is retained in the system. Table 2 presents model coefficients of the best-ranked gain model and best-ranked loss model selected using all-subsets regression. These best-ranked gain and loss models have weights of 0.310 and 0.132 respectively, which is almost double the weight of the second ranked models (0.152 and 0.075 respectively). In Supplementary Table 2 we also used the model.avg function of the 
            <rs type="software">MuMIn</rs> package to calculate a weighted mean of the coefficients of the best-ranked models together representing a cumulative weight-sum of 0.95 (i.e. a 95% confidence subset). Supplementary Table 2 (model-averaged) and main text Table 2 (best-ranked) model parameters are very similar. Supplementary Tables 3 and4 report the complete sets of carbon gains and loss models that contribute to the model average results.
        </p>
        <p>The model-average results show the same continental differences in sensitivity to environmental variables as the best-ranked models. From 2000 to 2015, carbon gains increased due to CO2-change (+3.7% in both the averaged and the best-ranked models, both continents), while temperature rises led to a decline in gains, which especially had an effect in the Amazon (-1.14% and -1.07% due to MAT and MAT-change together in the averaged and best-ranked model respectively). Finally, both models result in similar predictions of the net carbon sink over the 1983-2040 period: the future net sink trend in Africa is -0.004 and -0.003 in the best-ranked and averaged models respectively; in Amazonia the future net sink trend is -0.013 and -0.011 in the best-ranked and averaged models respectively. The Amazon sink reaches zero in 2041 using model-averaged parameters compared to 2035 using the best-ranked models.The model-average results show the same continental differences in sensitivity to environmental variables as the best-ranked models.

        <p>To calculate future modelled trends in carbon gains and losses (Figure 3), we first estimated annual records of the predictor variables (CO2-change, MAT, MAT-change, MCWD, WD and CRT) to 2040 (Extended Data Figure 5). CO2 and MAT and the observed records we removed any difference in intercept between the RCP trends and observed trends, so the RCP trends were a continuation of the end-point of the observed trajectory in 2015. We did not estimate the sensitivity of MCWD under the RCP scenarios, because the CMIP5 model means do not show drought trends for our forest plot networks, unlike rain gauge data for the recent past, and thus would show little or no sensitivity to MCWD. For each modified slope, Supplementary Table 5 reports the absolute decline in the sink in each continent in 2030 compared to the 2010-15 mean sink. This shows that the future sink strength is sensitive to future environmental conditions, but within both RCP scenarios and our bounds of possibility we show a decline in the sink strength in both continents over the 2020s.To calculate future modelled trends in carbon gains and losses (Figure 3), we first estimated annual records of the predictor variables (CO2-change, MAT, MAT-change, MCWD, WD and CRT) to 2040 (Extended Data Figure 5).
