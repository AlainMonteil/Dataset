        <p>The growing medical and personal needs of the world's population have intensified the release of pharmaceutical compounds and personal care products into the environment (Maldonado-Torres et al., 2018). Due to their universal use, their chemical and physical properties and inefficient removal by conventional wastewater depuration treatments and consequent discharge into receiving waters, the presence of pharmaceutical compounds (hereafter referred only as pharmaceuticals) has raised major concerns to the environment and consequently to human health (Zenker et al., 2014). Over the past few years, there has been an increasing awareness of the presence of pharmaceuticals in various compartments of aquatic ecosystems (e.g. water, sediments and biota), at concentrations that can potentially cause negative effects to the aquatic organisms (Ebele et al., 2017). For that reason, the European Union (EU) has recently established several regulations relatively to the presence of these micropollutants in water resources. Directive 2013/39 EU stated the need to develop new, cheaper and more cost-effective treatment technologies able to remove pharmaceuticals from wastewater (Directive 2013/39/EU). Then, Decision 2015/495/EU launched the first watch list of chemicals, which included several pharmaceuticals, aiming at gathering relevant monitoring data to support future decisions on their inclusion in the list of priority substances (Decision 2015/495/EU, the economic and technical viability of magnetic carbonaceous materials in the treatment of waters contaminated with these micro-organic contaminants, it is essential to establish a relationship between the advantages resulting from magnetic properties and the resulting side effects on the binding capacity (Han et al., 2015).The growing medical and personal needs of the world's population have intensified the release of pharmaceutical compounds and personal care products into the environment (Maldonado-Torres et al., 2018).

        <p>In the above described context, this review aims to discuss the research work developed between 2012 and 2019 regarding the use of magnetic carbon materials (MCM), prepared specifically from activated carbons (MC AC M), biochars (MC BC M) and hydrochars (MC HC M), in the removal of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater. The different aspects and significance of MCM in water treatment, namely the synthesis routes used to produce MCM, their chemical, physical and morphologic characteristics, their performance in the removal of pharmaceuticals of different classes (e.g. antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), antiepileptic and others) from aqueous media and their real application in water and wastewater treatment, will be presented and discussed. Also, the efficiency of MCM in the removal of pharmaceuticals from water was compared with that of their non-magnetic carbonaceous precursors and the pros and cons of using MCM in water treatment were further discussed.In the above described context, this review aims to discuss the research work developed between 2012 and 2019 regarding the use of magnetic carbon materials (MCM), prepared specifically from activated carbons (MC AC M), biochars (MC BC M) and hydrochars (MC HC M), in the removal of pharmaceuticals from water and wastewater.

        <p>The pre-requisite to impart magnetic properties to carbonaceous precursors is their combination with metal oxide nanoparticles (Kakavandi et al., 2013;Reguyal et al., 2017).

        <p>Several parameters play an important role in the size of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles obtained, namely: the concentration of Fe II and Fe III salts, the concentration of OH -(the alkaline conditions), the water activity in the solution (Yegane Badi et al., 2018) and the temperature (Petrova et al., 2011). The successful production of MCM by the coprecipitation method depends on the selection of the above-mentioned experimental parameters (Petrova et al., 2011;Yegane Badi et al., 2018).Several parameters play an important role in the size of the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles obtained, namely: the concentration of Fe II and Fe III salts, the concentration of OH -(the alkaline conditions), the water activity in the solution (Yegane Badi et al., 2018) and the temperature (Petrova et al., 2011).

        <p>The magnetization of carbonaceous precursors by co-precipitation can be achieved using two different experimental approaches: in-situ or ex-situ. The in-situ method relies on the simultaneous formation of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles and their impregnation in the framework of carbon-based materials at a certain pH (between 11 and 12), temperature (below 100 ºC) and under shaking conditions (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Castro et al., 2009;Danalıoğlu et al., 2017;İlbay et al., 2015;Kakavandi et al., 2013;Lompe et al., 2018;Rai and Singh, 2018;Yegane Badi et al., 2018). In the ex-situ method, the magnetic oxide nanoparticles are first synthesized by the co-precipitation method (or purchased) and afterwards are dispersed in a solution containing the carbonbased material, under controlled pH and temperature (Baghdadi et al., 2016).

        <p>This method is extremely versatile, since it is capable of producing different species (e.g. goethite, lepidocrocite, magnetite, ferrihydrite and feroxyhyte). However, the reaction conditions, namely the pH, suspension concentration, rate of oxidation, temperature and concentration of foreign species, must be carefully controlled to avoid the formation of mixtures, and assure that a monophasic product is obtained (Burstein, 2003;Cornell and Schwertmann, 2003). Another disadvantage of this method is the precipitation of soluble salts (e. g.

        <p>Pyrolysis is a thermochemical method consisting of the decomposition of a carbonaceous structure at temperatures higher than 400 ºC under inert atmosphere (absence of oxygen). The result is the formation of solid (charcoal), liquid (tar and an aqueous solution of organics) and gaseous products (CO, CO 2 , H 2 and CH 4 ) (Maschio et al., 1992;Siddiqui et al., 2019;Thines et al., 2017). The incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles in the carbon precursor can be performed by pre-or post-coating reaction (Siddiqui et al., 2019).

        <p>In order to improve the porosity of MCM, Quin et al. explored the catalytic mechanisms of iron salts during the activation of a HC with CO 2 . The CO 2 was used as an alternative to the classic chemical activators to promote an increase of the porosity of carbon-based materials, due not only to its effectiveness, but also because it avoids secondary waste disposal problems and the high consumption of chemical agents. The pyrolysis products of the iron salt (α-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 ) can catalyse the thermal cracking of carbonaceous materials, leading to a decrease in the pyrolysis temperature needed to attain maximum porosity and, consequently, a reduction in the energy consumption.In order to improve the porosity of MCM, Quin et al. explored the catalytic mechanisms of iron salts during the activation of a HC with CO 2 .

        <p>In 2016, Wong et al. evaluated the potential of magnetic commercial powdered AC (palm based), functionalized with triethoxyphenylsilane (silanization), for the removal of different pharmaceutically active compounds. The carbon matrix was magnetized by conventional co-precipitation, and the coating with an organosilane promoted a strongest connection between the magnetite nanoparticles and the carbon framework. The obtained composite material was less susceptible to Fe (i.e. magnetite) leaching, in particular in more acidic conditions. Nevertheless, the magnetic strength of the composite material decreased after the silanization reaction (Wong et al., 2016). In the same year, Arya and Philip investigated the use of a magnetic polymer clay composite prepared by combination of clay (bentonite), chitosan, powdered AC and iron magnetic nanoparticles, in the removal of both cationic and anionic pharmaceuticals. The composite nanomaterial was prepared by a simple and costeffective route, consisting of the co-precipitation of Fe III /Fe II salts on the clay (under stirring and N 2 atmosphere), followed by the dispersion of the iron coated clay and the powdered AC, and their dropwise addition to a chitosan solution (under vigorous stirring). Finally, and by using a crosslinking agent, small pellets of the clay-chitosan mixture were obtained (Arya and Philip, 2016). Later on, a novel composite material of Fe 3 O 4 /AC/chitosan was prepared by Danalıoğlu et al. (2017), who used the coprecipitation method for this purpose, and tested it in the removal of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and amoxicillin. A mixture of AC precursor and Fe II /Fe III salts were dispersed in a solution of chitosan and the reaction took place under mechanical stirring, alkaline conditions (pH ca. 11 and 12) and controlled temperature (50 ºC) (Danalıoğlu et al., 2017).In 2016, Wong et al. evaluated the potential of magnetic commercial powdered AC (palm based), functionalized with triethoxyphenylsilane (silanization), for the removal of different pharmaceutically active compounds.

        <p>The co-precipitation is the most commonly used synthesis route (a total of 44 % of works reported in the literature), due to its simplicity, consisting of mixing and heating (Figure 2A.) (Siddiqui et al., 2019;Thines et al., 2017). This method has been recognized for its industrial importance because it does not require expensive equipment and usually operates at temperatures below 100 ºC. Besides that, no toxic intermediates or solvents are produced by this process, being eco-friendly, and it is reproducible and easily scaled-up (Ahn et al., 2012) (Lu et al., 2007). The main disadvantage in preparing Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles by co-precipitation is their tendency to agglomerate, in particular when they are very small (Ahn et al., 2012). Besides that, the reaction conditions require a carefully control to avoid the formation of non-magnetic compounds (Ahn et al., 2012;Lu et al., 2007).

        <p>Regarding the type of carbonaceous precursor used to produce the MCM (Figure 2B.), 57 % consist of commercial AC (e.g. coal, palm-based carbons or coconut shell) (Arya and Philip, 2016;Baghdadi et al., 2016;Barkdoll and Fard, 2019;Danalıoğlu et al., 2017;Fröhlich et al., 2019;İlbay et al., 2015;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Lompe et al., 2018;Moacă et al., 2019;Saucier et al., 2017;Sellaoui et al., 2017;Shan et al., 2016;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015;;Yegane Badi et al., 2018), 32 % uses renewable biomass resulting from agricultural activities as raw material (e.g. pinesawdust, coconut shell, willow branches, corn stalks, reed stalks and sugarcane bagasse) to produce BC (Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a;Shan et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2017) and HC (Qian et al., 2016;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2012;Zhu et al., 2014) and the remaining 11 % include other types of organic precursors, such as brown marine algae (Jung et al., 2019), the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Luo et al., 2019) and polyethylene terephthalate containers (Rai and Singh, 2018). The use of waste materials arising from different activities as precursors for the production of adsorbents has the advantage of being cost-effective, not only due to the low cost of the residue itself, but also because it provides a new path for its management and valorization, in line with circular economy principles.Regarding the type of carbonaceous precursor used to produce the MCM (Figure 2B.), 57 % consist of commercial AC (e.g. coal, palm-based carbons or coconut shell) (Arya and Philip, 2016;Baghdadi et al., 2016;Barkdoll and Fard, 2019;Danalıoğlu et al., 2017;Fröhlich et al., 2019;İlbay et al., 2015;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Lompe et al., 2018;Moacă et al., 2019;Saucier et al., 2017;Sellaoui et al., 2017;Shan et al., 2016;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015;;Yegane Badi et al., 2018), 32 % uses renewable biomass resulting from agricultural activities as raw material (e.g. pinesawdust, coconut shell, willow branches, corn stalks, reed stalks and sugarcane bagasse) to produce BC (Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a;Shan et al., 2016;Wang et al., 2017) and HC (Qian et al., 2016;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2012;Zhu et al., 2014) and the remaining 11 % include other types of organic precursors, such as brown marine algae (Jung et al., 2019), the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Luo et al., 2019) and polyethylene terephthalate containers (Rai and Singh, 2018).

        <p>The specific surface area (S BET ) represents the total surface area of a material per unit of mass and depends on the size of the particles and the presence of pores in its surface. Usually, a high S BET is strongly correlated with a high removal efficiency and in some cases, also the pore size distribution may have an important role. The S BET of commercial AC used in the literature to prepare MC AC M ranges between 560 and 1986 m 2 /g (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Danalıoğlu et al., 2017;Fröhlich et al., 2019;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Lompe et al., 2018;Luo et al., 2019;Moacă et al., 2019;Rai and Singh, 2018;Saucier et al., 2017;Shan et al., 2016;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015)). Due to the low S BET of magnetic iron oxides, with values of 19 m 2 /g for magnetite (Reguyal et al., 2017) and 64 m 2 /g for maghemite (Lompe et al., 2018), the loading of iron oxides onto the abovementioned carbon materials usually implies a decrease in the S BET (Kakavandi et al., 2014;Lompe et al., 2018;Rai and Singh, 2018;Shan et al., 2016;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015) ) and higher contents of these iron oxides (Fe 3 O 4 or ɣ-Fe 2 O 3 ) on the carbon framework will lead to lower surfaces areas of the produced MC AC M (Lompe et al., 2018;Wong et al., 2015). The same behaviour was observed after incorporating MnFe 2 O 4 (Wan et al., 2014) and NiFe 2 O 4 (Fröhlich et al., 2019) onto the AC matrix. The obstruction of AC pores by the nano-sized iron oxides, with diameters ranging between 30 and 100 nm for Fe 3 O 4 (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Yegane Badi et al., 2018), 17 nm for Fe 2 O 3 (Lompe et al., 2018), between 20 and 70 nm for MnFe 2 O 4 (Wan et al., 2014) and around 7-8 for NiFe 2 O 4 , also represents an important contribution to the decrease in the S BET of MC AC M (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016). The MC AC M prepared by Wang et al. (2017) from raw agricultural biowastes and using a simple one-step synthesis, evidenced a highly developed pore structure with S BET values around 700 m 2 /g (Wang et al., 2017), which are comparable to those of commercial AC (Danalıoğlu Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f et al., 2017; Kakavandi et al., 2014;Saucier et al., 2017;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015)). The composite MCM prepared combining AC, Fe II and Fe II salts and a 0.1 % chitosan solution, presented a S BET of 204 m 2 /g, and this low value is also related to the reduced S BET of chitosan (61 m 2 /g vs 560 m 2 /g of AC) (Danalıoğlu et al., 2017).The specific surface area (S BET ) represents the total surface area of a material per unit of mass and depends on the size of the particles and the presence of pores in its surface.

        <p>Concerning the BC and HC prepared from agricultural wastes or other biomasses (e.g. brown marine algae), the S BET is frequently quite low, varying between 1 and 298 m 2 /g (Jung et al., 2019;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal andSarmah, 2018a, 2018b;Shan et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2014). Contrarily to AC, due to the reduced S BET of BC and HC, the magnetization of these materials has usually resulted in an increased of S BET for the produced MCM (Jung et al., 2019;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Shan et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2014). This was the trend followed for the MC BC M and MC AC M prepared by the mechanical ball milling method, in the work of Shan et al. (2016). The S BET and also the total pore volume increased remarkably for the MC BC M when compared with BC (S BET equal to 365 and 31 m 2 /g, respectively), which was attributed to some Fe 3 O 4 particles crushed during the process into the BC, leading to the formation of more pores. On the other hand, the production of MC AC M resulted in lower S BET than the precursor AC (S BET 486 m 2 /g vs 994 m 2 /g for MC AC M and AC, respectively), suggesting pore blockage by some nano-sized Fe 3 O 4 produced in the milling process (Shan et al., 2016). Unlike the previous studies, in the works developed by Reguyal et al. (2017) and Reguyal andSarmah (2018a, 2018b), the S BET of pine sawdust decreased from 298 to 126 m 2 /g, after the incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles onto the biomass to produce MC BC M. This decrease was explained by the very low S BET of Fe 3 O 4 particles (19 m 2 /g) and plausibly by a pore blockage of the carbonaceous material by these magnetic nano-sized particles (Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal andSarmah, 2018b, 2018a).Concerning the BC and HC prepared from agricultural wastes or other biomasses (e.g. brown marine algae), the S BET is frequently quite low, varying between 1 and 298 m 2 /g (Jung et al., 2019;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal andSarmah, 2018a, 2018b;Shan et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2014).

        <p>However, according to the author, the use of excessive conditions can eventually cause structural ordering and pore widening, which lead to the reduction of S BET and pore volume (Jung et al., 2019). According with Qian et al. (2016), the CO 2 gas (activator agent) and the type of iron salt (acting as a catalyst and precursor for the formation of magnetic nanoparticles) used in the pyrolysis process of MCM had positive effects on the S BET of the produced materials. Higher porosity, and consequently, higher S BET values were achieved using FeCl 3 . This salt is a strong Lewis acid and promotes the thermal cracking of the carbon matrix (confirmed by the production of H 2 gas), which causes the formation of pores. Other salts, including Fe(NO 3 ) 3 , FeC 2 O 4 , FeC 6 H 5 O 7 and Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 , inhibited the pore development, leading to lower S BET values. Besides that, Qian et al. (2016) observed that increasing the proportion of FeCl 3 in relation to the carbonaceous precursor, which resulted in an increase of the amount of H 2 released, did not always result in a S BET increase. This was explained by the overloading and blocking of the pores produced by the α-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 (Qian et al., 2016). Wan et al. (2014), studied the effect of hydrothermal treatment in an air-flow electric oven to the precipitated MCM (prepared by oxidative hydrolysis of Fe II salt in alkaline conditions), and the results show that increasing the temperature from 25 to 150 ºC led to an increase in S BET (Wan et al., 2014).

        <p>Particles magnetisation represents a key factor for successful magnetic separation and it is often expressed by the saturation magnetization, M s , a measure of the maximum magnetic strength (Singh et al., 2012). Ideally, the MCM should be ferromagnetic and in this situation, due to the intrinsic moment of the material, a strong attractive interaction towards a magnetic pole is achieved (Ambashta and Sillanpää, 2010). Several MCM evidenced a ferromagnetic nature (Rai and Singh, 2018;Saucier et al., 2017;Wan et al., 2014). Other MCM exhibit super-paramagnetic characteristics (Fröhlich et al., 2019;Jung et al., 2019;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Saucier et al., 2017), i.e. the interaction is weakly attractive towards a magnetic pole (Ambashta and Sillanpää, 2010), and still show excellent magnetic responses to a magnetic field (Kakavandi et al., 2014). In both cases, and due to the high magnetic sensitivity exhibited by the produced MCM, they can be easily and rapidly separated from the solution by permanent magnets (Shan et al., 2016) (weak intensity magnetic forces that produces magnetic fields of less than 1 T) (Ambashta and Sillanpää, 2010).Particles magnetisation represents a key factor for successful magnetic separation and it is often expressed by the saturation magnetization, M s , a measure of the maximum magnetic strength (Singh et al., 2012).

Other MCM exhibit super-paramagnetic characteristics (Fröhlich et al., 2019;Jung et al., 2019;Kakavandi et al., 2014;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Saucier et al., 2017), i.e. the interaction is weakly attractive towards a magnetic pole (Ambashta and Sillanpää, 2010), and still show excellent magnetic responses to a magnetic field (Kakavandi et al., 2014). In both cases, and due to the high magnetic sensitivity exhibited by the produced MCM, they can be easily and rapidly separated from the solution by permanent magnets (Shan et al., 2016) (weak intensity magnetic forces that produces magnetic fields of less than 1 T) (Ambashta and Sillanpää, 2010).</p>
        <p>In the literature, mass saturation magnetization (M s ) for bare magnetic particles are within 60 and 90 emu/g for Fe 3 O 4 (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Danalıoğlu et al., 2017;Moacă et al., 2019;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a), 58 emu/g for ɣ-Fe 2 O 3 (Lompe et al., 2018), 70 emu/g for MnFe 2 O 4 (Wan et al., 2014), 94 emu/g for CoFe 2 O 4 (Saucier et al., 2017) and 47 emu/g for NiFe 2 O 4 (Fröhlich et al., 2019). Meanwhile, for the carbonaceous precursors, published values vary between 0 and 0.3 emu/g (Reguyal and Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 21 Sarmah, 2018bSarmah, , 2018a;;Wan et al., 2014). As for the MCM, there is a wide range of published values, between 0.3 emu/g (Saucier et al., 2017) and 64 emu/g (Qian et al., 2016). Similarly to other discussed parameters, M s values of MCM are highly dependent on the experimental conditions of the synthesis, in particular the mass ratio of the carbonaceous precursor and iron salts/magnetite used. Higher M s are achieved by decreasing the mass ratio between the carbonaceous precursor and the iron salts/magnetite, i.e. increasing the mass fraction of Fe 3 O 4 in the carbon framework (Lompe et al., 2018;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a;Wong et al., 2015). According with Qian et al. (2016), the M s values have a positive correlation with the Fe content on MCM (Qian et al., 2016) and Reguyal and Sarmah (2018) showed that M s had a linear relationship with the amount of Fe 3 O 4 per mass of adsorbent (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a). Rattanachueskul et al. (2017) showed that a 400 ºC treatment applied to MCM produced via a single co-precipitation and hydrothermal treatment, resulted in improved magnetic properties with an increment of about two-fold on the M s value. Similarly, Wan et al. (2014) verified a positive correlation between M s and the hydrothermal treatment applied to the precipitated MCM, leading to an increase of ca. 8 times when rising the temperature from 25 to 150 ºC (Wan et al., 2014). Also, the temperature used during the calcination process applied by Saucier et al. (2016) affected the Ms of the MCM, leading to lower M s values by decreasing the temperature. Additionally, the magnetic nature of MCM was affected by the decomposition temperature: the MCM produced at 600 ºC showed a ferromagnetic behaviour while the MCM obtained at 260 ºC was super-paramagnetic (Saucier et al., 2017). The type of magnetic particles incorporated into the carbon matrix also influences MCM magnetic properties.In the literature, mass saturation magnetization (M s ) for bare magnetic particles are within 60 and 90 emu/g for Fe 3 O 4 (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Danalıoğlu et al., 2017;Moacă et al., 2019;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a), 58 emu/g for ɣ-Fe 2 O 3 (Lompe et al., 2018), 70 emu/g for MnFe 2 O 4 (Wan et al., 2014), 94 emu/g for CoFe 2 O 4 (Saucier et al., 2017) and 47 emu/g for NiFe 2 O 4 (Fröhlich et al., 2019).

        <p>SEM has been useful to provide information regarding the distribution of magnetic nanoparticles, which has typically been identified as uniform or homogeneously diffused on the carbon framework (Kakavandi et al., 2014;Saucier et al., 2017;Wong et al., 2016). The micrographs indicate the existence of rough surfaces (Rai and Singh, 2018;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Wong et al., 2015;Yegane Badi et al., 2018), with pore structures of different shapes and sizes (Baghdadi et al., 2016; Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f distributed (Kakavandi et al., 2014;Rai and Singh, 2018;Rattanachueskul et al., 2017;Yegane Badi et al., 2018). SEM also provides information on the incomplete (Wong et al., 2016) or severe pore blockage (Rai and Singh, 2018). Despite the effective pore obstruction by Fe 3 O 4 , SEM images obtained by Reguyal and Sarmah showed an unusual non-uniform distribution of these nanoparticles onto the surface of pine sawdust BC (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a). SEM images obtained by Zhu et al (2014) indicated the formation of a smooth surface for MC HC M, with γ-Fe 2 O 3 particles distributed on the surface of the porous HC (characterized by its rough surface and sphere-like microparticles) and without aggregation of nanoparticles (Zhu et al., 2014). According to SEM observations by Wan et al. (2014), the MnFe 2 O 4 particles distributed onto the surface of AC had not only different sizes, but also different shapes, depending on the temperature used in the hydrothermal treatment (applied after the oxidative hydrolysis of Fe II in alkaline media). At 25 and 70 ºC, spherical particles were widely distributed onto the AC surface, while at 150 ºC both spherical and acicular manganese ferrite particles of diverse diameters were observed (Wan et al., 2014). In the work by Saucier et al. (2017), the small CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles coating the surface of AC were well diffused in the pores of the carbon shell and due to their paramagnetic nature, aggregates were formed (Saucier et al., 2017). Fröhlich et al.

Also, increasing the FeCl 3 salt concentration to 20 mM, the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles tended to aggregate, which was due to the high Fe loading found under these experimental conditions (Qian et al., 2016). In the case of manganese ferrite nanoparticles, TEM images obtained by Wan et al.

However, these authors observed an increase of h and t 1/2 in the initial stage, which was due to the complexation reactions of CEX and the iron oxides onto the MCM surface and contributed to an acceleration of initial sorption kinetics. This suggests that both the porosity and the surface heterogeneity have influence in the kinetic of the process (Rai and Singh, 2018). The nature of the carbonaceous precursor also affects the adsorption kinetics and, based on the work of Shan et al.

According with Reguyal et al.

An opposite trend was observed by Jung et al. ( 2019) and higher k 2 and h were obtained by increasing the concentration of ASA from 50 to 200 mg/L. This trend was explained by the enhancement of the driving force of AAS caused by a larger concentration gradient between the media and the MCM, leading to a faster adsorption process (Jung et al., 2019).

        <p>In some studies, depending on the nature and composition of the adsorbent material, the adsorption equilibrium isotherm changed from Langmuir to Freundlich model, after the incorporation of magnetic particles in the carbonaceous matrix. This behaviour was observed by Wan et al. (2014) As may be seen in Table 2, some works in the literature have compared the adsorption capacity of MCM with that of the carbonaceous precursor. Usually, MCM presents a lower capacity than its precursor, which has been explained by the decrease of the S BET resulting from the partial blockage of the microporous structure of the carbon matrix by magnetic nanoparticles (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a;Wong et al., 2016) (Wan et al., 2014), as referred in section 5.1.1. Exceptionally, a higher q max was obtained for the adsorption of CEX onto MCM (S BET = 289 m 2 /g; q max = 71.42 mg/g) than onto AC (S BET = 660 m 2 /g; q max = 21.27 mg/g) prepared from polyethylene (Rai and Singh, 2018). The same was verified by Wong et al. (2015), who produced three MCMs with different Fe loadings (3.8, 7.8, or 8.6 %) that displayed higher q max for the adsorption of IBP (between 100.6 and 157.3 mg/g) than the AC precursor (72.7 mg/g). This was explained by the interactions established between the aromatic ring of IBP and the C=O group created by the oxidation during magnetite/maghemite impregnation on the surface of the carbon material. However, the MCM produced with the smallest Fe load (3.8 %) showed the largest q max (157.3 mg/g), which was related to a possible pore blockage when increasing the loading of magnetite/maghemite (Wong et al., 2015). The modification of MCM with TEPS to produce a CMCM, was followed by an increase in the q max values of CBZ, IBP and other micropollutants (Wong et al., 2016). Indeed, the q max values determined for the produced CMCM were equivalent or higher to those obtained with the AC precursor. In this particular case, the formation of outer-layer pores with phenyl functional groups, creating a hydrophobic area that favored π-π interactions with the target pollutants, was the explanation given for the relatively high q max onto CMCM (Wong et al., 2016).In some studies, depending on the nature and composition of the adsorbent material, the adsorption equilibrium isotherm changed from Langmuir to Freundlich model, after the incorporation of magnetic particles in the carbonaceous matrix.

        <p>The contribution from bare magnetic nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Lompe et al., 2018;Wong et al., 2015), γ-Fe 2 O 3 (Lompe et al., 2018;Wong et al., 2015) and MnFe 2 O 4 (Wan et al., 2014) in the sorption process of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions is small. However, both the nature and, specially, the amount of nanoparticles used to produce the MCM have a large influence on their adsorptive behaviour towards pharmaceuticals. The study conducted by Baghdadi et al. (2016) demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of MCM towards CBZ decreased by increasing the Fe 3 O 4 content on the AC precursor, due to blockage of some pores of the adsorbent and/or increase of the inactive Fe 3 O 4 content on MCM (Baghdadi et al., 2016). The same was observed by Lompe et al. (2018) by increasing the mass fraction of γ-Fe 2 O 3 on the surface of an AC (Lompe et al., 2018). According with Reguyal and Sarmahall (2018b), the addition of Fe 3 O 4 to pine sawdust BC generally resulted in a decrease in S BET (from 298 m 2 /g for BC to 252-97 m 2 /g for the three MCM, Fe 3 O 4 having a S BET of 19.4 m 2 /g) and in the frequency distribution of sorption site energies for SMX. Hence, the sorption capacity of the adsorbent material decreased. In fact, the values obtained for maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (q max ) showed an inversed linear relation with the percentage of Fe 3 O 4 on the BC (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a).The contribution from bare magnetic nanoparticles of Fe 3 O 4 (Baghdadi et al., 2016;Lompe et al., 2018;Wong et al., 2015), γ-Fe 2 O 3 (Lompe et al., 2018;Wong et al., 2015) and MnFe 2 O 4 (Wan et al., 2014) in the sorption process of pharmaceuticals from aqueous solutions is small.

        <p>Furthermore, the presence of Fe 3 O 4 in the carbon background resulted in the inaccessibility of the hydrophobic surface of the material, lowering the hydrophobic interaction between SMX and the BC (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018a).

        <p>The nature of carbon material used as precursor of the MCM has also an impact on their adsorptive performance. The study performed by Shan et al. (2016), in which mechanical ball milling was used to produce MCM, showed that the adsorption of CBZ and TC was more favourable onto the MCM prepared using an AC than onto the one prepared with a BC. This difference could be explained by the S BET of the resulting MCM, which was 1.3 times higher in the case of MC AC M. It was also demonstrated that a BC precursor is more suitable for the removal of pharmaceuticals with a higher molecular diameter (TC instead of CBZ). As for the use of AC as precursor, due to its porous morphological structure, the removal of small molecules is favoured.The nature of carbon material used as precursor of the MCM has also an impact on their adsorptive performance.

        <p>The study performed by Fard and Barkdoll (2019) evaluated the kinetic of sedimentation of both AC and MCM.

        <p>The antibiotic SMX is an ionizable compound and its distribution between aqueous and organic phases depends on its degree of ionization. Due to its pK a (1.25 and 5.29) and depending on the solution pH it can exist in cationic, neutral non-ionized and anionic forms (Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b). In the study conducted by Reguyal et al. (2017), the MCM was unstable at pH below 4 and at pH 10, due to the leaching of the iron content from MCM, but stable in the pH range between 4 and 9. Within this pH range, the highest adsorption efficiency was attained at ~ pH 4, where neutral SMX is the main specie in solution and electrostatic interactions between SMX and the positively charged MCM (pH pzc = 9.5) are not likely to be involved. Instead, hydrophobic interactions must have been involved in the SMX adsorption (Reguyal et al., 2017). In a subsequent study, it was showed that the highest q max for MCM-SMX system was attained at pH 4.5 and the lowest at pH 8.5 (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b). Moreover, the adsorption capacity increased with the ionic strength at pH 6.5, suggesting that electrostatic interactions were not involved in the adsorption process (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b) and so corroborating the previous results (Reguyal et al., 2017). In both works and within the pH range studied, hydrophobic π-π interactions were the main mechanism involved in the SMX adsorption onto MCM (Reguyal et al., 2017;Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b).

        <p>and both π-π interaction and hydrogen bonds were involved in the overall SMX Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f adsorption process. For pH values outside this range, adsorption was hindered and, in alkaline medium, the repulsions between the negatively charged surface of MCM (pH pzc = 6.3) and the negatively charged SMX were responsible for the decrease observed in the adsorption (Wan et al., 2014). In the work conducted by Lompe et al. (2018), the MCM towards SMX exhibited a low adsorption capacity in tap and surface waters (pH of ca. 7.6) containing other pharmaceuticals, and this was also attributed to the repulsions between the SMX negative species and the negatively charged MCM (pH pzc =7.0-7.3). In more complex systems, the adsorption process is also dependent of the hydrophobicity character of the different pharmaceuticals in solution (Lompe et al., 2018). According with Reguyal and Sarmah (2018a), the higher hydrophobicity of EE 2 (log K OW = 4.2) when compared to that of SMX (log K OW = 0.9), led to a significant decrease on the SMX adsorbed by MCM in a binary solution containing these two pharmaceuticals (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b). However, Qian et al. (2016) showed that there was a poor linear relationship between q max and log K OW of several pharmaceuticals (SMX, STZ, SP, DCF and CAF), indicating that the K OW values alone are not enough to predict the affinity of these compounds towards MCM (Qian et al., 2016).and both π-π interaction and hydrogen bonds were involved in the overall SMX Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f adsorption process.

In both previous works, the pH pzc of the respective MCM was not referred but should have been considered for the rigorous interpretation of the results. Electrostatic interactions were pointed out by Badi et al. (2018) as the main processed involved in the interaction between CTX and an AC-based magnetic material. The removal efficiency of CTX (pK a1 =1.72, pK a2 =3.15 and pK a3 = 4.34) decreased by increasing the pH from 3 to 11, and the highest removal efficiency was attained at pH 3.1. The decline observed under alkaline conditions was explained by the reduction in the electrostatic affinity between the negatively charged MCM (pH pzc =6.4) and the negatively charged CTX (Yegane Badi et al., 2018). Regarding the adsorption of CEX by MCM, the work of Rai and Singh (2018) MCM and the benzene ring of CEX (Rai and Singh, 2018). The adsorption behavior exhibited by NOR (pK a1 =6.34 and pK a2 =8.75) onto a MCM derived from BC was different from that of the previous systems (Wang et al., 2017). The adsorption capacity increased between pH 4 and 7, remained stable at pH above 7 and attained its maximum at pH 9 and 10. This was explained by the positively charged MCM in solution at pH ranging between 2 and 10 (the chemical composition of loaded γ-Fe 2 O 3 was mainly in the form of FeOH +2 ). Since the proportion of the negative form of NOR increases with pH, the authors highlighted the importance of the contribution of electrostatic forces in the adsorption process. However, the influence of other adsorption mechanisms, such as π-π electron donor-acceptor interactions (the fluorine groups and benzene ring in the NOR structure acts as electron acceptors) and the pore-filling effect were also referred as possible (Wang et al., 2017).

        <p>The removal of IBP (pK a =4.91) using MCM produced from palm shell wastebased AC was studied by Wong et al. (2015), who verified a better adsorption performance at pH 4 than at pH 7. These authors concluded that electrostatic interactions between the positively charged MCM (pH pzc = 9.1) and the deprotonated form of IBP (the main specie in solution at pH 7) were not the main removal mechanism involved in the adsorption process. Instead, the governing mechanism was due to dispersive π-π interactions between the aromatic ring of IBP and the graphitic carbon of MCM (Wong et al., 2015). Singh et al. (2012) studied the removal of IBP by MCM (pH pzc =7.0) at different pH (2.5, 6.5 and 10.5) and deduced that, at pH&gt;pH pzc , the adsorption of IBP decreased due to electrostatic repulsion. Similarly, in the work of Wong et al. (2016), the highest adsorption capacity of IBP (pK a =4.91) by the CMCM and MCM (both materials with pH pzc =8.5) was obtained at pH 2 and it decreased as the pH increased. The lowest adsorption capacity occurred at pH&gt;10 due to the electrostatic repulsions between the deprotonated IBP species and the negative surface of CMCM (Wong et al., 2016) and MCM (Fröhlich et al., 2019).

As well, the removal of DCF (pK a =4.0) by MCM (pH pzc= 6.9) decreased, increasing the solution pH from 5 to 9; electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions had important roles on the DCF adsorption efficiency (Luo et al., 2019).The removal of IBP (pK a =4.91) using MCM produced from palm shell wastebased AC was studied by Wong et al.

The double electrical layer is particularly relevant in the negatively charged IBP, since the ion Na + in solution might cause an electrical screen of the negatively charged oxygenated groups of MCM, resulting in the formation of a second layer of a positively charge in its surface. Therefore, the repulsive interactions are annulated and consequently, IBP adsorption increases (Wong et al., 2016). , Al 3+ , Fe 3+ , Mn 2+ and Cu 2+ ) on the adsorption of SMX onto a MCM at neutral pH. Clearly, increasing concentrations of SiO 3 2-and SO 4 2-ions decreased the adsorption of SMX. However, the competition effect of the other studied ions was considered negligible, which was related with the selectivity of MCM for SMX. This selectivity was explained by the electrically charged screen exerted by ions on the surface charge of MCM (pH pzc =6.32), which changed the interactions between the negatively charged SMX and MCM (Wan et al., 2014). Wan et al. (2014) also studied the effect of humic acids on the adsorption of SMX onto a MCM, in surface water (under neutral conditions). Results showed that the adsorption of SMX was not affected by the presence of humic acids (concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of 1.0 mg/L). Selectivity for SMX was attributed to the Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f size exclusion of the microporous MCM, hindering the adsorption of bulky humic substances and favoring the adsorption of small sized SMX molecules (Wan et al., 2014). This was also observed by Reguyal &amp; Sarmah (2018a), who verified that the effect of Suwanee River natural organic matter (NOM) in the removal of SMX by MCM from aqueos media (pH ca. 6.5) was negligible, even at high concentrations, i.e. 20 mg/L (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b). Contrarily, the results by Arya and Philip (2016) showed that the removal effiency of ATN, CPF and GFB by MCM was reduced, respectively, in 45, 21 and 31 %, in the presence of humic acids (10 mg/L), which therefore competed with the pharmaceuticals for the adsorption binding sites (Arya and Philip, 2016). Lompe et al. (2018) after 6 cycles (Yegane Badi et al., 2018). Wan et al. (2014) demonstrated that, at adjusted pH 4, H 2 O 2 was efficient in the regeneration of a SMX saturated MCM, which maintained 72 % of its capacity after 5 regeneration cycles. These authors also observed a higher regeneration efficiency for the MCM than for the AC precursor, indicating that the presence of MnFe 2 O 4 /MnO 2 nanoparticles was valuable in the regeneration process (Wan et al., 2014). Regarding the MCM prepared by Luo et al.

The removal efficiencies of EE2, KTP and other micropollutants (in a multi-component system) were maintained after 5 cycles of adsorption/desorption with methanol, decreased slightly with ethanol and decrease to ca. 25 % and 10 % with HCl and NaOH, respectively.

The regeneration of two MCM (with 3.8 % and 8.6 % of Fe) and the corresponding AC precursor by thermal treatment (350 ºC during 3 h) was evaluated by Wong et al. (2015) throughout 6 repeated cycles. After thermal regeneration, the adsorption capacity of both MCM towards IBP was better than that of AC.

As for both MCM, the adsorption capacity increased at the second cycle but then decreased gradually until the sixth cycle (with 41 and 22 % reductions compared with the first sorption values of MCM with a Fe content). This reduction after several thermal cycles was assigned to the incomplete removal of IBP from the microporous structures of AC and MCM and to the exhaustion of functional groups (Wong et al., 2015).

In this way, authors identified the desorption peaks of the considered pharmaceuticals and micropollutants and confirmed that 350 ºC was adequate for the thermal regeneration of saturated materials.

        <p>The main disadvantage of producing MC AC M and MC BC M is the decrease or blockage of pores on BC and AC surface which results from the introduction of Fe 3 O 4 or other magnetic nanoparticles in the framework of these materials (Rai and Singh, 2018;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015;;Yegane Badi et al., 2018). Some binding sites may became unavailable for adsorption (Lago et al., 2003) and magnetic nanoparticles usually present a lower S BET when compared with the carbon material (particularly in the cases where the precursor are AC and not BC) (Lago et al., 2003;Lompe et al., 2018;Reguyal et al., 2017) which frequently cause a decrease in the overall S BET of MCM (Kakavandi et al., 2014;Lompe et al., 2018;Rai and Singh, 2018;Shan et al., 2016;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015)).

Occasionally, some of the works reported in the literature showed that the presence of iron oxide particles introduced additional binding sites for the adsorption of pharmaceutical molecules, with the consequent increase in adsorption capacity (Rai and Singh, 2018;Wong et al., 2015). Finally, although the preparation of MCM is cost effective (Yegane Badi et al., 2018) (Reguyal et al., 2017), it involves higher production costs when compared with non-magnetic AC, BC and HC.The main disadvantage of producing MC AC M and MC BC M is the decrease or blockage of pores on BC and AC surface which results from the introduction of Fe 3 O 4 or other magnetic nanoparticles in the framework of these materials (Rai and Singh, 2018;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015;;Yegane Badi et al., 2018). Some binding sites may became unavailable for adsorption (Lago et al., 2003) and magnetic nanoparticles usually present a lower S BET when compared with the carbon material (particularly in the cases where the precursor are AC and not BC) (Lago et al., 2003;Lompe et al., 2018;Reguyal et al., 2017) which frequently cause a decrease in the overall S BET of MCM (Kakavandi et al., 2014;Lompe et al., 2018;Rai and Singh, 2018;Shan et al., 2016;Wan et al., 2014;Wong et al., 2016Wong et al., , 2015)).

        <p>Due to the irrefutable advantages associated with the use of magnetic carbonbased adsorbents, it can be envisioned that these materials represent a sustainable alternative for water purification. However, it is essential to establish a compromise between the potential attributed to MCM magnetic properties and related side effects on their binding capacity towards target pollutants. Also, and based on the works reported in the literature, there is still a lack of information regarding the adsorption efficiency of MCM in multicomponent systems and in natural water matrices. Such information is essential regarding the use of MCM in real treatment applications. Therefore, further studies will be necessary to understand the impact of natural organic matter, inorganic and organic compounds and other micropollutants, ubiquitously present in waters and wastewaters, in the sorption capacity of MCM towards pharmaceuticals. Also, the regeneration of MCM should be deeply investigated, aiming to find efficient and environmentally-friendly regeneration processes, allowing for MCM reuse. On the other hand, pilot scale demonstrations on the utilization of MCM for the removal of pharmaceuticals from water are necessary but missed in the literature.

        <p>competing organic compound (EE2) also decreased the removal of SMX by MCM, which was related to the higher affinity of the MCM for EE2 (with a higher hydrophobic character than SMX) (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b). The performance of two MCM in the treatment of simulated hospital effluents containing pharmaceuticals (e.g. AMX, PCT, DCF, ASA), sugars and organic and inorganic components was evaluated by Saucier et al. (2017). Both MCM were effective in the removal of pharmaceuticals, with adsorption efficiencies ranging between 93.0 and 99.4 % (Saucier et al., 2017). On the other hand, Lompe et al. (2018) evaluated the adsorption efficiency of an AC and different MCM (with Fe 3 O 2 mass fractions of 10, 38 and 54%) in the removal of different mixed micropollutants (pharmaceuticals and pesticides) from tap water. The Freundlich adsorption coefficient (K F ) followed the trend EE2&gt;NRT&gt;CBZ&gt;DCF≈CAF≈SMX, so indicating that the removal of less soluble pharmaceuticals (i.e., more hydrophobic such as EE2, NRT and CBZ) was favored when compared to those presenting a higher solubility (e.g. SMX and CAF). The low adsorption verified for DCF (despite its low solubility) and SMX was further explained by the repulsive interactions between the negative charge of these pharmaceuticals and the negatively charged surface of the AC and the different MCM (pH of tap water &gt; pH pzc of the AC and MCM) (Lompe et al., 2018).competing organic compound (EE2) also decreased the removal of SMX by MCM, which was related to the higher affinity of the MCM for EE2 (with a higher hydrophobic character than SMX) (Reguyal and Sarmah, 2018b).

        <p>The reusability of MCM has a great impact on their cost-effectiveness at real scale applications, such as wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, it is important to evaluate MCM regeneration via chemical (Barkdoll and Fard, 2019;Luo et al., 2019; Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f al., 2018) or thermal treatment (Wong et al., 2015), and the effects of such regeneration on MCM's physico-chemical properties and adsorption performance (Rattanachueskul et al., 2017). Also, the evaluation of the desorption process might be useful to elucidate possible mechanistic aspects on the adsorption of pharmaceuticals by MCM and the convenience of their utilization in subsequent adsorption/desorption cycles (Rai and Singh, 2018;Reguyal et al., 2017;Singh et al., 2012;Wong et al., 2015).The reusability of MCM has a great impact on their cost-effectiveness at real scale applications, such as wastewater treatment plants.

        <p>Regarding the chemical regeneration, acid solutions have been discouraged, due to the dissolution of magnetite at low pH conditions (Wong et al., 2015). Reguyal et al. (2017) tested several organic solvents and deionized water to desorb SMX from saturated MCM and found that the polarity of the solvent used played an important role in this process. After one adsorption/desorption cycle, desorption of SMX with deionized water was unfavourable (&lt;4 %), while organic solvents such as 2-propanol and acetone allowed for significant desorption percentages (45 % and 67 %, respectively). In the study of Arya and Philip (2016), ATN, CPF and GFP desorption with deionized or tap water was negligible, which was related to the strong affinity between these pharmaceuticals and the MCM surface. Desorption of ATN and CPF with methanol was nearly 10 % while it was 70 % for GFP; the authors inferred that strong hydrophobic interactions played a major role in the adsorption of the latter. As for CPF, 29 % was desorbed from MCM in alkaline conditions (NaOH 0.02 M) and 40 % of ATN desorption was achieved with slightly acidic solutions (HCl 0.02 mM), which indicated the importance of electrostatic interactions in the adsorption of this pharmaceutical (Arya and Philip, 2016). The desorption experiments conducted by Ray and Sing (2018) showed that 0.1 M NaOH was the best desorption solution, followed by methanol and finally doubly deionized water, with desorption efficiencies (one Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 52 adsorption/desorption cycle) of CEX from MCM of 42, 23 and 5 %, respectively. The desorption results suggested that electrostatic interactions were the main mechanism involved in the adsorption and desorption of CEX onto MCM, although hydrophobic interactions also contributed to the overall process. Besides that, CEX desorption from MCM was lower than that from its AC precursor, probably due to a stronger interaction/affinity of CEX with the MCM (Rai and Singh, 2018). Singh et al. (2012) evaluated the desorption of IBP from MCM with an alkaline solution (NaOH 0.1 M) and methanol, attaining desorption percentages of 55 % and 47 %, respectively. Therefore, the authors inferred that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions had a role in the adsorption of IBP onto MCM (Singh et al., 2012). Desorption kinetics of three antibiotics (AMX, CPF and ETM, single solutions) from MCM using three different solutions (S1: phosphate buffer solution (pH=7.4), S2: isotonic NaCl solution (0.9% w/v), S3: ethanol (10% v/v)) was studied by Danalıoğlu et al. (2017). In 1 h, AMX was 50, 70 and 25 % desorbed by S1, S2 and S3, respectively, being completely desorbed by S2 within 3 h. As for CPF and ETM, the maximum desorption (15 %) was attained using S1 after 3 and 7 hours, respectively (Danalıoğlu et al., 2017). Thus, the authors concluded that the produced MCM was more stable to hold of CPF and ETM than AMX. Rattanachueskul et al. (2017) evaluated the reusability of MCM after saturation with TC and verified that the adsorption performance decreased from 100 % to 82 % after the first regeneration cycle with 0.1 M NaOH solution, and to 57 % after the fourth cycle (Rattanachueskul et al., 2017).
