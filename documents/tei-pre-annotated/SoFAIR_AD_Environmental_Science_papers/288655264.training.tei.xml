        <p>Contaminated water with hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is a serious environmental problem. This study aimed to evaluate the Cr(VI) removal by zero valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) reduction process and the impact of Cr(VI), nZVI and combined treatment with nZVI and Cr(VI) on tomato growth performance. To evaluate the Cr(VI) toxic effect on germination capability, seeds were exposed to increasing Cr(VI) concentrations up to 1000 mg L -1 . The inhibition of seed germination and the decrease of hypocotyl and root length started from Cr(VI) 5 mg L -1 . Under treatment with Cr(VI) + nZVI 5 mg L -1 , seed germination, hypocotyl and root length resulted significantly higher compared to Cr(VI) 5 mg L -1 treatment. The impact of only nZVI was investigated on chlorophyll and carotenoid in leaves; iron levels in leaves, roots, fruits and soil; carotenoid, fat-soluble vitamin and nicotianamine in mature fruits. A significant increase of leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids was observed after nZVI 5 mg L -1 treatment compared to controls. No significant variations were observed in carotenoids, fat-soluble vitamins and nicotianamine levels after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 in mature fruits. For their ability to reduce Cr(VI) and to stimulate tomato growth, nZVI might to be considered as alternative for remediation purposes.Contaminated water with hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is a serious environmental problem.

        <p>According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, chromium (Cr) has been ranked 7 th among the top 20 hazardous substances and no.1 carcinogen 1,2 . Cr occurs in different oxidation states (-2 to + 6), but hexavalent chromate Cr(VI) and trivalent chromite Cr(III) forms are the most common and stable in the natural environment 3 . Compared to Cr(III), Cr(VI) is highly mobile in soil, extremely toxic to living organisms with mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic potential 4 . On the other hand, Cr(III) is significantly less toxic and serves as an essential element in trace amounts. Environmental contamination of Cr(VI) is gaining increasing consideration worldwide due to its high levels in the water and soil deriving from natural and anthropogenic activities including industrial applications such as metallurgical, refractories and chemicals 3 . The exposure to Cr(VI) can cause several serious diseases in nervous, kidney, hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems of humans [5][6][7] . Cr(VI) is also a toxic heavy metal for plants and it is harmful to their development and metabolism, interfering with plant growth, nutrient uptake and photosynthesis, inducing enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, causing lipid peroxidation and altering the antioxidant activities 8 . It is also important to stress that Cr uptake by crops and accumulation in edible plant parts organs with serious risks for consumer health 5,9 .According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, chromium (Cr) has been ranked 7 th among the top 20 hazardous substances and no.1 carcinogen 1,2 .

        <p>In order to remove Cr(VI) from soil and water and eventually reuse the reclaimed water for irrigation purposes, several methods have been researched and reviewed extensively. These include chemical reduction to Cr(III), solvent extraction, chelation and adsorption, among others [10][11][12] . In recent years, zero valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their efficiency in removal of different types of contaminants from aqueous solutions. nZVI are characterized by a core-shell structure, with the core made of metallic iron and the shell constituted of oxide and hydroxydes of Fe(II) and Fe(III) 13 . Relatively little is known about the potential of using nanoparticles for the removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous systems. In a recent study, Zhao et al. 14 described a novel amino-functionalized vermiculite (AVT)-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (AVT-nZVI) for Cr(VI) removal from simulated electroplating rinse wastewater. Wang et al. 15 demonstrated that zero-valent iron (Fe 0 ) nanoparticles (NPs) with 4% bentonite were efficient for the treatment of Cr(VI)-containing wastewaters. The feasibility of Cr(VI) removal through nZVI has been also verified in our previous works when present alone 16,17 and in co-presence with other pollutants (nitrates) 18 . The good results obtained by this process and the need to operate with excess when not only Cr(VI) is present as a contaminant, made necessary to carry out a study on the effects of the residual nanoparticles in the water. This is linked with the aim of this work which represents an investigation of the effects of nanoparticles on plant growth. Indeed, only a limited amount of studies has been conducted to evaluate the phytotoxicity of nZVI despite of the fact that exposure to plants is due to the intentional injection into the soils 19,20 and to the best of our knowledge, there are not report regarding the use of nZVI on tomato plants.In order to remove Cr(VI) from soil and water and eventually reuse the reclaimed water for irrigation purposes, several methods have been researched and reviewed extensively.

        <p>The present research deals with a comprehensive study of Cr(VI) removal from contaminated water by nZVI reduction process and of the impact of nZVI when present alone and in co-presence with Cr(VI) on Solanum lycopersicum growth performance. In particular, the toxic effect of different concentrations of Cr(VI) has been evaluated on tomato seed germination and seedling development. The effects of the water treated with nZVI have been also studied on tomato growth performance in terms of chlorophyll and carotenoid content in the leaves. Moreover, a chemical profile of the metabolites produced in the mature fruits, both in terms of carotenoids, fat-soluble vitamins and nicotianamine (NA) content has been carried out to investigate the impact of nZVI on plant metabolism.The present research deals with a comprehensive study of Cr(VI) removal from contaminated water by nZVI reduction process and of the impact of nZVI when present alone and in co-presence with Cr(VI) on Solanum lycopersicum growth performance.

        <p>Kinetic study. As shown in Fig. 1, the kinetic model proposed in a previous work 11 , proved to be able to describe the results obtained at nZVI/Cr(VI) molar ratio (R) ≥ 1, while when the particles were added below the stoichiometric molar ratio, the asymptotic behavior of the experimental data trend was not well fitted. In particular, when nanoparticles were added a similar initial trend was observed for all the investigated R, but at R = 0.5, due to the low amount of nZVI in solution, reaction stopped at a removal of about 50%. Conversely, when a sufficient dosage was provided (starting from the stoichiometric amount, R = 1), a quantitative removal was obtained within 120 min of treatment. In the absence of other competitive species for nZVI oxidation a stoichiometric dosage of nZVI with respect to the concentration of Cr(VI) is therefore recommended. Any excess of nanoparticles can undergo a quick oxidation by oxygen in water: their persistence and the effect on plant growth when treated water is used for irrigation is therefore worth of investigation.Kinetic study.

        <p>Seed germination is a crucial process that influences crop yield and quality. The increase of Cr(VI) concentration from 5 to 1000 mg L -1 adversely affected the germination gradually decreasing the tomato seed germination percentage (Table 1).Seed germination is a crucial process that influences crop yield and quality.

        <p>The negative effect of Cr(VI) on seed germination was previously explored in different plants of agronomic interest. Rout et al. 21 demonstrated that the treatment with 200 μM Cr(VI) reduced by 25% germination of Echinochloa colona L. seeds. The presence of Cr(VI) at high concentrations in the soil reduced to 48% seed germination in Phaseolus vulgaris L 22 . Decreased seed germination with increasing concentration of chromium ions was also observed for cowpea Vigna sinensis L. 23 , melon (Cucumis melo L.) 24 , and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 25 . As it has been proposed, chromium could activate proteases or inhibit amylase activity with the subsequent decreased transport of carbohydrates to the germ leading to the seed death or delayed seed germination 26 .The negative effect of Cr(VI) on seed germination was previously explored in different plants of agronomic interest.

        <p>In this study, a significant increase of seed germination with increasing culture time (3,6 and 10 days) was also observed in all experimental groups (Table 1). In addition, after the transfer of seeds to deionized H 2 O, they still germinated nearly 100% (data not shown).In this study, a significant increase of seed germination with increasing culture time (3,6 and 10 days) was also observed in all experimental groups (Table 1).

        <p>Once Cr(VI) overcome biophysical barriers, seeds could initiate several cellular defense mechanisms to nullify and attenuate the adverse effects of chromium, accumulating, storing and immobilizing the heavy metal by binding them with amino acids, proteins or peptides. Tong et al. 27 reported that plant firstly tries to prevent metal transport across the plasma membrane by binding or modification of metal ions. Secondly, metal ions which enter the plant body are detoxified through inactivation or converted into less toxic form.Once Cr(VI) overcome biophysical barriers, seeds could initiate several cellular defense mechanisms to nullify and attenuate the adverse effects of chromium, accumulating, storing and immobilizing the heavy metal by binding them with amino acids, proteins or peptides.

        <p>Effect of nZVI on tomato seed germination. Chi-Square test revealed significant statistical differences between germination percentage at all experimental times and treatments (Table 1). In particular, after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 , 100% seed germination was observed at all culture times. A positive effect on seed germination was observed also after treatment with nZVI 50 mg L -1 . A recent study of Li et al. 28 showed that exposure of peanut seeds to low concentration of nZVI (40-80 µmol L -1 nZVI) can promote the germination rate. The authors have proposed that the nanoparticles can penetrate the plant seed coat to support water uptake. In support of this evidence, Guha et al. 29 found that rice seeds treated with 20 mg L -1 nZVI showed the fastest water uptake, increased amylase and protease enzyme activities and seedling vigour. This mechanism could also be applied to explain the findings of this work. nZVI at 5 and 50 mg L -1 may penetrate the tomato seed coats increasing the water uptake to stimulate seed germination.Effect of nZVI on tomato seed germination.

        <p>However, the exposure of tomato seeds to nZVI at 100 and 1000 mg L -1 negatively affected the seed germination. This inhibitory effect on germination was previously observed in other plant species such as cattail (Thyfa latifolia) and hybrid poplars (Populus deltoids x Populus nigra) treated with high concentrations of nZVI (&gt;200 mg L -1 ) 19 . It can be proposed that high concentrations of nZVI forming a coating on seed surface could alter membrane pores and interfere with the water and nutrient uptake process. On the other hands, Ma et al. 19 observed the formation of black coating on root surface on Thyfa latifolia and Populus deltoids x Populus nigra, after treatment with nZVI (&gt;200 mg L -1 ).However, the exposure of tomato seeds to nZVI at 100 and 1000 mg L -1 negatively affected the seed germination.

        <p>Seed germination percentage was always higher after nZVI treatment compared to Cr(VI) + nZVI and Cr(VI) at all tested concentrations.

        <p>Although the ability of nZVI to reduce Cr(VI) and improve tomato seed germination at 5 and 50 mg L -1 , the improving of germination after nZVI + Cr(VI) treatment cannot be attributed only to reduction of Cr(VI) but the presence of nZVI could have contributed to the improvement in germination, compensating the negative effect of Cr(VI). 2A,B illustrates that the length of root and hypocotyl was inversely related with increase of Cr(VI) concentration showing a significant toxic effect of Cr(VI) on 7 day-old seedlings. Inhibition of seedling growth occurred starting from Cr(VI) 5 mg L -1 and gradually increased with increasing of Cr(VI) concentration. Tomato seedling growth was completely inhibited by Cr(VI) 500 and 1000 mg L -1 . Among other toxic effects of chromium, the inhibition of root growth was widely observed. Inhibitory effects of chromium on the root elongation were found in Vigna radiata and Glicine max 30,31 . Daud et al. 32 reported that chromium caused a significant reduction in cotton root/shoot length, number of secondary roots, and root fresh and dry biomasses at 100 μM. The root growth defects under exposure to high levels of heavy metals can be caused by inhibition of root cell division and/or reduction of cell proliferation 33 . Chromium severely affected tomato seedling development. As showed in Fig. 3, a significant decrease of hypocotyl (B) length after Cr(VI) 5 mg L -1 treatment compared to control plants was observed.Although the ability of nZVI to reduce Cr(VI) and improve tomato seed germination at 5 and 50 mg L -1 , the improving of germination after nZVI + Cr(VI) treatment cannot be attributed only to reduction of Cr(VI) but the presence of nZVI could have contributed to the improvement in germination, compensating the negative effect of Cr(VI). 2A,B illustrates that the length of root and hypocotyl was inversely related with increase of Cr(VI) concentration showing a significant toxic effect of Cr(VI) on 7 day-old seedlings.

        <p>The treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 significantly increased the length of both seedling root and hypocotyl compared to Cr(VI) treatment (Fig. 3A,B). The root development significantly improved after nZVI 5 mg L -1 treatment also compared to the control group (Fig. 3A). These results are congruent with previous studies demonstrating that low doses of nZVI enhance plant growth. Guha et al. 29 observed that the treatment with 20 mg mg L -1 nZVI enhanced growth of aromatic rice cultivar (Oryza sativa cv. Gobindabhog L.) increasing root (~ 3.3 fold) and shoot (~ 1.52 fold) length, biomass and photosynthetic pigment content 30 . A recent study of Kim et al. 20 showed that exposure of Arabidopsis thaliana to 500 mg L -1 nZVI can enhance root elongation because nZVI induces cell wall loosening. Ma et al. 19 demonstrated that Typha plants treated with nZVI (&lt;50 mg L -1 ) grew better than controls.The treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 significantly increased the length of both seedling root and hypocotyl compared to Cr(VI) treatment (Fig. 3A,B).

        <p>with nZVI 5 mg L -1 , a significant increase of chlorophyll b was observed with respect to the control leaves. No significant differences were observed in total chlorophyll levels (Fig. 4A). At 65 days of plant growth, a significant increase of chlorophyll a and b as well as total chlorophyll was observed after nZVI 5 mg L -1 treatment compared to control plants (Fig. 4B). At 35 and 65 days, a significant increase of carotenoid level was observed in the leaves after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 with respect to the control (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that low concentrations of nZVI (5 mg L -1 ) improved the photosynthetic pigment content of the tomato plants and no stress was induced due to the nZVI treatment. Similar results are previously obtained in rice seedlings treated with &lt;80 mg L -1 nZVI 29 . Conversely, Wang et al. 34 found that higher concentrations of nZVI (1000 mg L -1 ) in rice induced distinct signs of leaf chlorosis as chlorophyll and carotenoid content decreased markedly. In the present study, no significant variations were observed in number of nods and internods as well as number of flowers and plant height after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that nZVI at low concentration (5 mg L -1 ) can improve the efficiency of photosynthesis without any adverse effects on tomato plant development.

After treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 , iron concentrations in tomato roots were 2.56 and 8.29 mg/g DW at 35 and 65 days of plant development, respectively.

        <p>Carotenoid, fat-soluble vitamin and nicotianamine levels are listed in Table 2. No significant variations were observed among control and nZVI 5 mg L -1 samples, apart from β-carotene that significantly increased in mature fruits after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 . It is important to remember that carotenoids and vitamins are involved in a wide range of plant physiological processes, including growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli. Among the most important carotenoids, β-carotene represents about 7% of the total carotenoid content 36 . Carotenoid content is also one of the most important quality traits of tomato fruit, with industrial, health, and nutritional properties. The amount of carotenoids is correlated to fruit quality; a greater carotenoid content make a more nutritious and tastier tomato 37 . Moreover, carotenoids are essential components of human diets that provide precursors for biosynthesis of vitamin A, a well-known carotenoid derivative with widespread biological functions 38 .Carotenoid, fat-soluble vitamin and nicotianamine levels are listed in Table 2.

        <p>Differences between nicotinamine levels after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 were not significant. The non-proteogenic amino acid nicotianamine (NA) is ubiquitous in higher plants and has been hypothesized to play a key role in the provision and distribution of iron and other metals in the plants 39 . It has been shown that NA synthesis is induced by high iron availability and its levels increase in tomato shoot apex and roots, under iron supply, indicating that it can play a role in protecting the cells against supraoptimal iron concentration (100 μM) 40 . Our observations showed that, even though Fe levels increased in roots after the application of nZVI 5 mg L -1 , nicotianamine levels were not significantly increased suggesting that nZVI 5 mg L -1 not affected the Fe homeostasis in tomato plants.Differences between nicotinamine levels after treatment with nZVI 5 mg L -1 were not significant.

        <p>This study aimed to evaluate the Cr(VI) removal by nZVI reduction process and the impact of reclaimed water on Solanum lycopersicum sedd germination and seedling growth. In addition, the effect of low concentrations of nZVI (5 mg L -1 ) on tomato plant growth and metabolism was investigated. As the first of its kind, this work showed that the nZVI were able to convert Cr(VI) in Cr(III), a less toxic compound. Secondly, lower concentrations of nZVI (5 mg L -1 ) stimulated not only seed germination but also the root and hypocotyl growth of the tomato plantlets as well as the leaf chlorophyll and carotenoids levels. In this context, low concentrations of nZVI might be used to benefit the growth of tomato plants in agricultural settings. However high concentrations of nZVI (100 and 1000 mg L -1 ) adversely affected tomato seed germination. These result suggest that, when nanoremediation with nZVI is selected as the remediation method, it is important to consider both the remedial benefits and potential fate and toxicity of nZVI, and that the toxicity level is dependent upon plant species.This study aimed to evaluate the Cr(VI) removal by nZVI reduction process and the impact of reclaimed water on Solanum lycopersicum sedd germination and seedling growth.

        <p>Nicotianamine was extracted from 1 g of homogenized fresh tomato by adding 10 mL of water. After stirring and centrifugation for 10 min (6000 rpm, 25 °C), the supernatant was filtered (0.45 μm hydrophilic PTFE filter from Millipore) and diluted with a 0.1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution by a factor of 25. A 5-µL volume of the final extract was injected into the HPLC-ESI-MS/MS system. Chromatography was performed using a C18 XTerra column (150 × 2.1 mm, 3.5 µm from Waters) kept at 35 °C. Mobile phases consisted water (phase A) and water/ acetonitrile (30:70) (phase B), both of them containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 140 µL/min and it was entirely introduced into the mass spectrometer. The applied gradient was: t 0-0.5 min , 100% A; t 0.5-15 min , 100% B.Nicotianamine was extracted from 1 g of homogenized fresh tomato by adding 10 mL of water.
