        <p>The paper overviews the state-of-art of aircraft powered by hybrid electric propulsion systems. The research status of the design and energy management of hybrid aircraft and hybrid propulsion systems are further reviewed. The first contribution of the review is to demonstrate that, in the context of relatively underdeveloped electrical storage technologies, the study of mid-scale hybrid aircraft can contribute the most to both theoretical and practical knowledge. Meanwhile, the profits and potential drawbacks of applying hybrid propulsion to mid-scale hybrid airplanes have not been thoroughly illustrated. Secondly, as summed in the overview of design methodologies, the multi-objective optimization transcends the single-objective one. The potential of the hybrid propulsion system can be thoroughly evaluated in only one optimization run, if several objectives optimized simultaneously. Yet there are few researches covering the conceptual design of hybrid aircraft using multi-objective optimization. The review of the most popular energy management strategies discloses the third research gap-current methodologies favoured in hybrid ground vehicles do not consider the aircraft safety. Additionally, both non-causal and causal energy management are needed for performing a complicated flight mission with several sub-tasks.The paper overviews the state-of-art of aircraft powered by hybrid electric propulsion systems.

        <p>Over the last decades, the rapid growth in fossil fuel consumption has generated a need for energy sustainability. This is partly due to the widespread use of aircraft in both military and civilian applications. 1 Additionally, the exhaust gas has a negative impact on the environment, for example, contributing to global warming. 2 It is even worse if those emissions are from aircraft since the tail gas is directly discharged to the atmosphere. Concerning those adverse effects, NASA calls on the aeronautic industry to reduce aircraft fuel burn by 70% by 2025 in their N + 3 concepts. 3 The aim to sustain natural resources and relieve environmental pollution are pushing the related research areas to develop less fuel consumption and environmental friendly aerospace propulsion technologies. 1 The most prospective one is to shift towards electric propulsion systems, 4 e.g. the Electric Motor (EM), replacing the conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). Electric propulsion systems do not generate on-board emissions, so are more environmentally friendly. With reduced emissions, the electric aircraft has better stealth performance compared with the ICE-powered one. However, the energy density (specific energy) of electrical energy storage source, such as batteries, are much lower than that of fossil fuel. 5 The truth is that at this point in time and for the foreseeable future, aerial vehicles using electric propulsion systems cannot achieve the same flight range/endurance as their conventional (i.e. combustion engine) powered counterparts. 6 An evolving propulsion technology-Hybrid Electric Propulsion System (HEPS) comes to the researchers' mind and attracts much attention. HEPS integrates an electric powertrain with a conventional combustion engine to provide the propulsion. It can combine the clean power of an electric propulsion system with the extended range of an ICE. This results in decreased fuel burn and additional 'stealth mode' (low emissions/noise mode) compared with ICE-powered aircraft, and increased flying range compared with electric aircraft. For these reasons, there is a significant interest in further research into this technology and applications for the aviation industry. However, those advantages come at the cost of increased complexity of the system design and hybrid energy management (hybrid control).Over the last decades, the rapid growth in fossil fuel consumption has generated a need for energy sustainability.

        <p>Most studies on the review of hybrid electric powered vehicles and its design and control methodologies mainly focus on one research area. Researchers with aeronautic background typically examined scholarly and business samples on hybrid electric powered aircraft (hybrid aircraft), [7][8][9] rarely provided the comprehensive review of design and energy management methods. Brelje and Martins 10 surveyed design approaches of more-electric aircraft, but the paper did not concentrate on the hybrid electric ones. The authors did not find any fulllength-articles in the open literature providing the review of the state-of-the-art in the design methodology of hybrid aircraft and its HEPS, not mentioning the detailed comparative analysis and the study of research gaps.Most studies on the review of hybrid electric powered vehicles and its design and control methodologies mainly focus on one research area.

[11][12][13][14][15] Those reviews not only classified energy management strategies, but also put forward the most recent progress and advanced concepts. The pros and cons of each approach were addressed and compared.

        <p>In a hybrid propulsion system, two or more power sources with different configurations are combined to improve the performance of the whole system. In this paper, only two energy storages are considered: fuel and battery. For the fuel/battery hybridization system, the most commonly used configurations are series, parallel and series-parallel architecture.In a hybrid propulsion system, two or more power sources with different configurations are combined to improve the performance of the whole system.

        <p>In a series hybrid configuration, the propeller is driven only by the electric motor (see Fig. 1). 16 The engine power derived from combustion is converted into electrical power via a generator. The electrical power can be used to power the EM directly, or can be stored in the battery by a charging process. The series hybrid electric system is the one most easily extended to distributed electric powertrain. Therefore, it is widely accepted as the alternative propulsion system to hybridize the multi-rotor aircraft and large-scale airplanes.In a series hybrid configuration, the propeller is driven only by the electric motor (see Fig. 1). 16 The engine power derived from combustion is converted into electrical power via a generator.

Therefore, it is widely accepted as the alternative propulsion system to hybridize the multi-rotor aircraft and large-scale airplanes.</p>
        <p>The benefit of series hybrid configurations is that the engine is completely decoupled from the propeller and its output power is not related to the power demand of the powertrain. In other words, the engine can run at its optimal operating condition during the different working condition. The fuel efficiency of engine can remain high and its lifespan can be lengthened. Moreover, the series architecture has the definite advantage of flexibility for locating the ICE-generator set due to the mechanical decoupling.The benefit of series hybrid configurations is that the engine is completely decoupled from the propeller and its output power is not related to the power demand of the powertrain.

Moreover, the series architecture has the definite advantage of flexibility for locating the ICE-generator set due to the mechanical decoupling.</p>
        <p>However, the series configuration suffers from the poor system efficiency, since massive power losses exist in the combustion and electrical energy conversion. Another disadvantage is that it needs three propulsion devices: engine, generator and EM. All three propulsion devices need to be sized to cope with maximum power if the series HEPS is designed for sustained climbs. This makes series HEPS expensive and bulky. 6 Last but not the least, series architecture cannot make use of the maximum combined power potential of the engine and motor, since the engine is not mechanically connected to the load.However, the series configuration suffers from the poor system efficiency, since massive power losses exist in the combustion and electrical energy conversion.

        <p>In parallel configuration, the ICE and the EM are both connected mechanically to the propeller, so they can contribute to the propulsion energy either simultaneously or individually. 16 In addition with the parallel configuration, the ICE can simultaneously drive the propeller and motor/generator, thereby charging the battery pack. Other advantage of the parallel over the series configuration is that it only needs two propulsion devices-engine and motor/generator. Also, a smaller engine and a smaller electric motor can be used to get the same performance. 6 Even for long-climb trip operation, only the engine needs to be rated for the highest sustained power. The power losses are also reduced compared with the series configuration, with no need of mechanical-electrical energy conversion.In parallel configuration, the ICE and the EM are both connected mechanically to the propeller, so they can contribute to the propulsion energy either simultaneously or individually. 16 In addition with the parallel configuration, the ICE can simultaneously drive the propeller and motor/generator, thereby charging the battery pack.

        <p>However, the rotational speed of propeller is not always the optimal speed of the engine, thus operating at the optimum region of engine cannot be guaranteed. In general, there are two approaches to deal with this issue. The first and more direct one is to implement a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which permits the independence of the engine and propeller rotational speed. The second and more economical one is to develop an energy management strategy. The energy management strategy can optimize the power contribution of the engine and the motor, which enables the propulsion devices to operate at their optimum condition.However, the rotational speed of propeller is not always the optimal speed of the engine, thus operating at the optimum region of engine cannot be guaranteed.

        <p>Parallel hybrids are further classified according to the position of the motor/generator in the drivetrain. 17 For aircraft application, the double-shaft and single-shaft architecture are the two most popular ones. 18 Parallel hybrids are further classified according to the position of the motor/generator in the drivetrain. 17 If the engine and the motor/generator are mounted on two separate drive shafts, as shown in Fig. 2, the speed of the engine and motor/generator can be different from the propeller and each other. This architecture is called as double-shaft parallel configuration. Similarly, if a CVT is applied in this architecture, the speed of two propulsion devices can be decoupled from the speed of the propeller.Parallel hybrids are further classified according to the position of the motor/generator in the drivetrain. 17 For aircraft application, the double-shaft and single-shaft architecture are the two most popular ones. 18 Parallel hybrids are further classified according to the position of the motor/generator in the drivetrain. 17 If the engine and the motor/generator are mounted on two separate drive shafts, as shown in Fig. 2, the speed of the engine and motor/generator can be different from the propeller and each other.

        <p>If the engine is connected to the motor/generator but not directly linked to the propeller, the architecture is called single-shaft since the transmission has only one input shaft (see Fig. 3). Generally, the electric machine is directly linked to the propeller, while the engine is connected to the electric machine via decoupling devices and gears. In this architecture, the speed of motor/generators is always rigidly linked to that of the propeller. The mid-scale hybrid airplane particularly favours this architecture due to its lower mechanical complexity, 18 which is significant to save system weight and improve system safety.If the engine is connected to the motor/generator but not directly linked to the propeller, the architecture is called single-shaft since the transmission has only one input shaft (see Fig. 3).

        <p>The series-parallel configuration, also recognized as powersplit configuration, is a mixture of the two architectures shown above. 16 Here, the propeller, engine, motor and generator are connected to a planetary gear, provided by Fig. 4. This structure not only makes power distribution more flexible, but also allows the engine and motor to operate in its most efficient region. The series-parallel configuration is the most advanced configuration of the hybrid propulsion system, but it also requires the most complicated clutch/gearing mechanism and energy management.The series-parallel configuration, also recognized as powersplit configuration, is a mixture of the two architectures shown above. 16 Here, the propeller, engine, motor and generator are connected to a planetary gear, provided by Fig. 4.

        <p>Overall, the most commonly used configurations are illustrated above. Among them, the series configuration enables the engine to operate at its ideal operating condition. However, its system efficiency is relatively low since large power losses exist in the energy conversion. The series-parallel is the most functional, but complicated configuration out of the three architectures. It is the least popular configuration concerning aircraft application due to high complexity.Overall, the most commonly used configurations are illustrated above.

        <p>In addition to the powertrain configurations, hybrid propulsion systems also differ in the battery operating strategy, having two classifications: charge-sustaining and charge-depleting strategy. 16 The charge-sustaining strategy aims at maintaining the State-of-Charge (SoC) of the battery at a certain level with on-board recharging. This ensures the battery will always have an adequate reserve SoC in the case of an emergency, but the electricity cannot be made the biggest use of. The chargedepleting strategy differs in that the battery charge does not take place. The battery SoC is allowed to decrease continuously until its minimum value is reached. A consequence of not charging the battery in a charge-depletion system is that the battery needs to have enough capacity to provide enough power during the specified run time. Therefore, the chargedepleting strategy tends to lead to a large battery.In addition to the powertrain configurations, hybrid propulsion systems also differ in the battery operating strategy, having two classifications: charge-sustaining and charge-depleting strategy. 16 The charge-sustaining strategy aims at maintaining the State-of-Charge (SoC) of the battery at a certain level with on-board recharging.

        <p>The widespread researches and advances in hybrid electric propulsion systems in automobiles are transferrable to the aircraft industry. The automotive hybrid systems bring the benefit of increased endurance time as compared to electricpowered cars, with additional benefits of reduced noise, emissions and fuel consumption which are not attainable using gasoline-power. After acknowledging of those profits, aeronautic academia and industry begin to introduce the HEPS to power the aircraft. There is a significant interest in further research into this technology and its application to from small to large-scale aircraft.The widespread researches and advances in hybrid electric propulsion systems in automobiles are transferrable to the aircraft industry.

        <p>Initially, academics focused on the small-scale sector-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), to validate and demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid electric technology. 15,19 In 2005, Harmon et al. from the University of California-Davis, began the investigations of the small hybrid unmanned aircraft for the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission. 20,21 Harmon et al. proposed a conceptual design method to simultaneously size the aircraft wing and the hybrid propulsion system components. The sizing process yielded a 13.6 kg hybrid UAV with 4.65 m wingspan and 220 Wh battery. 20 A neural network control was applied to optimize the energy distribution of the hybrid UAV and propulsion system. 21 Simulations demonstrated that the designed hybrid electric UAV could consume less 54% energy than the gasoline-powered UAV for the three-hour ISR mission.Initially, academics focused on the small-scale sector-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), to validate and demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid electric technology. 15,19 In 2005, Harmon et al. from the University of California-Davis, began the investigations of the small hybrid unmanned aircraft for the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission. 20,21 Harmon et al. proposed a conceptual design method to simultaneously size the aircraft wing and the hybrid propulsion system components.

        <p>Harmon continued his research at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT). A comparison between various configurations and battery-discharging profiles was conducted by him and Hiserote. 18,22 It was concluded that, for the small unmanned airplane, the clutch-start parallel configuration with the battery charge-sustaining strategy was the best design and achieved the lowest empty weight. Continuing this design, the hybrid electric system was built and integrated to the remotelypiloted UAV, by Ausserer 23 and Molesworth. 24 The Honda GX35 engine (969 W) and Fuji motor (1.2 kW) were selected based on the optimal sizing by Hiserote. Ground integration partly validated the previous conceptual design, but the flight test had not been completed.Harmon continued his research at the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT).

        <p>Scho¨mann, from the Technical University of Munich, studied generic models of the components for the small-scale aircraft HEPS. 27 A scaling method was applied to model the ICE, since it is difficult to develop an accurate model for small engines. Following this work, a preliminary design method was developed to size hybrid propulsion systems for UAVs. 28 The method had three advantages: high accuracy, generality and low computational time consumption. A series of optimization designs were yielded from a range of payload requirements (from 10 kg to 70 kg). One exemplary result was a 35 kg hybrid airplane capable of taking 16 kg payload.Scho¨mann, from the Technical University of Munich, studied generic models of the components for the small-scale aircraft HEPS. 27 A scaling method was applied to model the ICE, since it is difficult to develop an accurate model for small engines.

        <p>The multi-rotor UAV has been considered as the gamechanger for the agricultural and industrial operator once coming to the market. However, its widespread applications had been retracted due to its relatively short endurance. Until 2017, Quaternium launched its first hybrid fuel-electric quadrotor drone, HYBRiX.20, capable of flying over 4 h. 30 Its series-hybrid technology solved the substantial restriction of the application of multi-copters to the medium-long missions. Equipped with a two-stroke petrol engine, HYBRiX.20 can achieve over 2 h of flight time when carrying around 6 kg maximum payload. 31 Another two series-hybrid multi-copters, Perimeter 8 32 and GAIA 160 33 acquire similar MTOW and payload capability, but have a certain decrease of flight duration. Perimeter 8 is the product by Skyfront providing security and surveillance solutions, while GAIA 160 was developed by Foxtech with rain-proof capability.The multi-rotor UAV has been considered as the gamechanger for the agricultural and industrial operator once coming to the market.

        <p>The study of the HEPS technology for mid-scale aircraft (general aviation aircraft or other light aircraft) also has drawn much attention. As mentioned above, researchers from AFIT investigated the potential application of HEPS to the unmanned aircraft. 18,[22][23][24] The studies suggested that HEPS technology represents a viable trade-off solution for smallscale aircraft, promoting the mitigation of emissions and fuel consumptions while providing adequate range and endurance performance. However, Hiserote questioned the adaptability of hybrid propulsion technologies to larger aircraft. 22 Another graduate student from AFIT, Ripple, examined the feasibility of HEPS for mid-scale aircraft, by retrofitting the General Aviation (GA) and remotely-piloted platforms-DA 20, Cessna 172 Skyhawk and Predator. 37 Taking Cessna 172 as the example, the MTOW of retrofitted hybrid aircraft was basically equal to the original Cessna one. The potential fuel savings of the designed mild HEPS could be up to 54 kg but 27 kg payload was sacrificed.The study of the HEPS technology for mid-scale aircraft (general aviation aircraft or other light aircraft) also has drawn much attention.

        <p>Glassock et al. designed a parallel hybrid propulsion system for an 8-passenger skydiving airplane. 38 The performances of fuel usage and climb rate were explored under different hybridization ratios. A constant hybridization ratio of 0.67 was finally selected, resulting in one 224 kW turbine engine and two 224 kW electric motors. Results demonstrated that the effective flight duration was severely limited at this ratio. Therefore, the short-duration high-power mission, such as skydiving, could benefit more from the hybrid propulsion technology in comparison with the conventional long-duration mission.Glassock et al. designed a parallel hybrid propulsion system for an 8-passenger skydiving airplane. 38 The performances of fuel usage and climb rate were explored under different hybridization ratios.

The engine failure emergency was considered in a later study by Finger et al. 41 Authors found out that the original optimal design was not available due to additional engine failure constraints. Furthermore, the MTOW of the sized hybrid aircraft would increase dramatically (50%) if 100 km diversion was requested after the engine failure.Finger et al. compared the series configuration and parallel configuration of HEPS for general light aircraft. 40 The paper claimed that the parallel hybrid architecture is superior to the series one in terms of decreasing the global weight and on-board fuel weight.

        <p>On June 2019, Ampaire flied a hybrid powered airplane Ampaire EEL (337). 50 Ampaire EEL was based on the Cessna 337, replacing the original rear piston engine (Continental IO-360) with a 180 kW electric motor. The two propulsors could power the aircraft in concert by driving two independent propellers. Ampaire refers to this combination of powerplants as a ''parallel hybrid architecture". Yet the output shafts of ICE and EM were totally decoupled, so the ICE could not charge the battery in flight.On June 2019, Ampaire flied a hybrid powered airplane Ampaire EEL (337). 50 Ampaire EEL was based on the Cessna 337, replacing the original rear piston engine (Continental IO-360) with a 180 kW electric motor.

        <p>Many aeronautical and automotive magnets (Bell, Honeywell and Uber etc.) believe that the urban and inter-city air travel will be a crucial part in the future of transportation since it provides the fast, efficient and congestion-free travel. The city airborne travel especially favours Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) than conventional takeoff and landing, due to the complex and compact urban environment. 51 The world's first flied hybrid VTOL aircraft, Surefly, was unveiled by the Workhorse Group. Its first untethered hover took place on April, 2018 and lasted around 10 s. 52 Surefly was driven by eight motors, every two of which were mounted on each of four arms. The eight motors were powered by a 150 kW piston engine and dual generators. The 150 kW ICE will eventually be replaced by a 223 kW turbine-powered ICE, thus the MTOW increases from 680 kg to 1 ton.Many aeronautical and automotive magnets (Bell, Honeywell and Uber etc.) believe that the urban and inter-city air travel will be a crucial part in the future of transportation since it provides the fast, efficient and congestion-free travel.

        <p>Delft University of Technology have conducted a series of studies on the application of HEPS to the regional airliners. Bogaert assessed the potential fuel reduction and emission mitigation of hybrid electric regional aircraft. 58 The hybrid regio-nal aircraft was designed based on the ATR 72-600 capable of carrying 68 passengers. The largest airframe difference between the reference aircraft and hybrid aircraft was in the wing area with a difference of 18%. The fuel consumption of hybrid aircraft was then investigated and proved to highly depend on the flight range. Thus, Voskuijl and Bogaert et al. derived a new analytical range equation to estimate the ranges of hybrid airliners. 59 Results demonstrated that the parallel hybrid-electric design could reach a 28% decrease in fuel mass at the cost of a 14% increase in MTOW. Note the conclusions were yielded under the progress of various electric and aerospace technologies. Zamboni et al. compared the fuel saving performance of three hybrid configurations, under different assumptions of technology levels. 60 Results illustrated that the parallel architecture is a conservative option considering today's state of the art technology, while the series one can benefit the most from the technology improvement. Vries and Hoogreef et al. 61,62 discussed the aero-propulsive profits of the hybrid electric system, for example the leading edge and boundary layer ingestion. It was concluded that these revenues are easily negated by the increased masses, unless the improved technology could significantly decrease the powertrain mass.Delft University of Technology have conducted a series of studies on the application of HEPS to the regional airliners.

        <p>The pioneer of hybrid technology-AFIT firstly applied the conventional aircraft design method to size the aircraft wing and HEPS components for the UAV. 18,20 The sizing problem was formulated as a constrained optimization problem, in which UAV performance requirements were represented by the constraints. Though the resulted payload capacity cannot meet the original performance requirement, the hybrid UAV saved approximately 40% fuel consumption over a similarly sized ICE-powered UAV. 18 Ripple, from AFIT, applied the same optimization routine to study the retrofit of several mid-scale Remotely-Piloted Aircraft (RPA). 37 The difference is that the wing spans of the retrofitted RPA were fixed as the same as the original gasoline-powered RPA (the reference aircraft). Case studies demonstrated that the retrofit of the reference airframes can be achieved with small margin of sacrifice of payloads (about 18%). The fuel savings of hybrid RPA were from 20% to 40%, compared to their corresponding reference RPA.The pioneer of hybrid technology-AFIT firstly applied the conventional aircraft design method to size the aircraft wing and HEPS components for the UAV. 18,20 The sizing problem was formulated as a constrained optimization problem, in which UAV performance requirements were represented by the constraints.

        <p>Generally, it is difficult to detach the design of hybrid propulsion system from the aircraft design process, since the power sizing of HEPS is coupled with the estimation of aircraft power requirements. Scho¨mann, in 2014, innovatively introduced the aircraft scaling approach and successfully decoupled the HEPS sizing and the aircraft design. 28 The computation burden was reduced by removing aircraft design variables. Scho¨mann studied models of all components of the hybrid propulsion system. 27 Computational efficiency was further improved by fitting the mathematical surrogate models, instead of using the original discrete data. Scho¨mann applied the proposed optimization procedures to retrofit the reference small UAV and the resulted hybrid powered aircraft could reach 5% fuel mass reduction.Generally, it is difficult to detach the design of hybrid propulsion system from the aircraft design process, since the power sizing of HEPS is coupled with the estimation of aircraft power requirements.

        <p>Pornet et al. firstly introduced the concept of supplied power, which represents the used engine/motor power for a given time step. 63 They achieved to simultaneously size the hybrid propulsion system and optimize the flight profile, by defining the energy specific air range as the objective. In 2015, Pornet et al. extended the concept of supplied power and defined a new optimal variable-the power setting, which is the power distribution factor between the engine and motor. 65 The power allocation was, therefore, well considered in the retrofit of a 180-PAX commercial transport aircraft. Another overall sizing of HEPS and aircraft was carried out by Pornet et al. 64 The research illustrated the relative changes in optimal block fuel versus different battery energy density. For example, results demonstrated that up to 20% fuel reduction could be reached if 1.5 kWh/kg battery was available. Delft University of Technology has been working on the conceptual design and assessment of the application of hybrid propulsion systems on regional transport aircraft. Bogaert concluded that a hybrid powered regional airliner (68-PAX) could save 30% fuel mass if the battery technique could be promoted to 1 kWh/kg. 58 In this initial sizing study, Bogaert integrated weight estimation of energy sources to the optimization iteration, but did not consider the weight changes of energy sources over the time. What's more, the average split, instead of the one per unit time, was employed to calculate the power use of energy sources. Based on Bogaert's design framework, Voskuijl et al. introduced the supplied power split that varied throughout the flight mission. 59 The study claimed that the traditional Breguet range equation is inapplicable to the hybrid aircraft, since more than one energy sources are used. Voskuijl et al. developed a new range equation for hybrid aircraft cruise flight. Up to 28% emission reduction was yielded with 1 kWh/kg battery. Note that the power distribution is assumed to be constant throughout the cruise flight in Voskuijl's study. As opposed to the constant power distribution, Zamboni et al. introduced power control parameters that was supplied by segment specific control laws. 60 The mass models of hybrid propulsion components had relatively low fidelity, while the performance characteristics of these devices were approximated with high-fidelity models. The paper claimed that this approach not only enabled a quick design in vastly diverse hybrid architectures, but also retained the most significant features. The final fuel saving varied from 20% to 40%, depending on different assumptions of the technology maturity levels.Pornet et al. firstly introduced the concept of supplied power, which represents the used engine/motor power for a given time step. 63 They achieved to simultaneously size the hybrid propulsion system and optimize the flight profile, by defining the energy specific air range as the objective.

        <p>Finger et al. proposed an initial sizing methodology for hybrid electric GA aircraft. 40,85 At the beginning, the matching diagram was employed to create an available design space, using the power-to-weight ratio and wing-loading parameter. The design space was then searched to optimize the configuration of the hybrid aircraft and its propulsion system. The impact of engine failure constraint on the design of hybrid GA aircraft was investigated in a later study of Finger et al. 41 The failure constraint, call as One Engine Inoperative constraint, was integrated to the previous proposed sizing procedures. The available design space was re-produced and found out to be shrunk with additional engine failure constraint. Results showed that up to 50% of take-off weight increased if 100 km distance was sized to engine-failed hybrid aircraft.Finger et al. proposed an initial sizing methodology for hybrid electric GA aircraft. 40,85 At the beginning, the matching diagram was employed to create an available design space, using the power-to-weight ratio and wing-loading parameter.

        <p>Many studies on the design and sizing of hybrid propulsion powered aircraft employed optimization-based methods. The optimal parameters and configurations of the hybrid propulsion system could be achieved both with or without the resizing of the aircraft. On the other hand, several researches applied engineering try-and-test methodologies, without need of optimization, to start the preliminary sizing of hybrid powered aircraft or scale the existing hybrid aircraft to the different sizes. Actually, in 2014, Perullo and Mavris claimed that an overall design of the aircraft hybrid propulsion system should be considered as a constrained optimization problem, not just a root-finding exercise. 90 Another worth-mentioning factor is that most optimization-based studies employed the single-objective method to reach the optimal sizing and design. 18,20,84,85,91-93, 28,37,40,41,58,60,63,64 However, the single objective (such as fuel minimization) can only give one optimal sizing at one specific performance request (like range), in one optimization run. Therefore, several optimization runs have to be carried out to examine the different performance demands. 22,28,39,40,58,60,64 The flight range or endurance is one of the most concerned performance for studies on the design or retrofit of hybrid powered aircraft. These studies evaluated variations in different optimal variables (fuel/battery mass, payload, take-off weight and electric-only time) under multiple range/endurance demands. 22,28,29,40,58,60,64,88 Typically, several optimization runs with an increase in range were performed to investigate the feasibility and benefit of hybrid propulsion system. Sliwinski et al. demonstrated the range and endurance of hybrid powered aircraft were lengthened by the increase of fuel mass, i.e. the decrease of fuel economy. 89 The multi-objective optimization can simultaneously optimize several costs, like fuel burn, take-off weight, vehicle noise and range. If the performance needs (such as range) are included in the cost function, the potential of the hybrid propulsion system can be thoroughly evaluated in one optimization run, by using multi-objective optimization. 94 Bryson et al. assessed the acoustic performance of hybrid UAV along various mission range requirements. The decrease of the aircraft noise was well-balanced by the increase of flight distance. The findings were published in an engineering note in a concise manner. 86 As yet there is no open full-length-articles covering the detailed analysis of hybrid propulsion system sizing using multi-objective optimization.

        <p>The study of multi-objective genetic algorithm is as early as the 1980s.

Efficient Non-dominated Sort (ENS), proposed by Zhang et al. in 2015, 98 is one of the most promising non-dominated sorting approach. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that the ENS is computationally more efficient than all previous non-dominated sorting methods.

        <p>Normally, the non-causal control cannot be implemented on the practical application unless future mission information is priori-known. Despite this, the non-causal optimization is still the most studied energy management strategy for the hybrid propulsion system. 13 In general, there are two approaches handling the energy management non-causal problem: the one is to solve the original nonlinear problem directly; another one is to simplify the original problem with approximation techniques.

        <p>The original non-convex, mixed integer problem was converted to a new problem by two main steps. The first one was the convexification process. The battery pack energy was first introduced as the state variable. The state transition equality became convex but not affine, by replacing the battery SoC with battery pack energy. Then, the non-affine equality constraint was relaxed to a convex inequality constraint. Finally, the battery constraints were converted to a convex form. The second step was to relax the mixed integer convex problem into conventional convex programming. Two integer control variables-gear ratio and engine on/off were tuned outside the optimization loop with the heuristic decisions. The heuristic approach removed the need for solving a mixed integer problem, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem. Results indicated that both the convexification process and heuristic approach have a small influence on the optimal solution. The convex optimization pointed toward similar battery size to one of the DP. 107 As opposed to the previous study, Elbert et al. calculated the optimal engine on/off command using Pontryagin's maximum principle. 108 The engine is switched on if and only if the requested power exceeds a certain threshold, which is dependent on the co-state and electrical buffer energy. The study also gave the necessary condition for a globally optimal solution of the convexified problem. It was shown to deliver optimal results in less time than DP even in the presence of active state constraints.The original non-convex, mixed integer problem was converted to a new problem by two main steps. The first one was the convexification process. The battery pack energy was first introduced as the state variable. The state transition equality became convex but not affine, by replacing the battery SoC with battery pack energy. Then, the non-affine equality constraint was relaxed to a convex inequality constraint. Finally, the battery constraints were converted to a convex form. The second step was to relax the mixed integer convex problem into conventional convex programming. Two integer control variables-gear ratio and engine on/off were tuned outside the optimization loop with the heuristic decisions.

        <p>The convex programming has been proved to be an efficient optimization to solve the component sizing and energy management problem. 109,110 However, the approximation and relaxation methods used in the convexification process, may lead to the errors between the original problem and the convexified problem. Murgovski et al. illustrated that the relaxation of state transition equality does not bring any errors between the original and the convexified model. 111 On the other hand, the error of approximation has not been discussed in the paper.The convex programming has been proved to be an efficient optimization to solve the component sizing and energy management problem. 109,110 However, the approximation and relaxation methods used in the convexification process, may lead to the errors between the original problem and the convexified problem.

        <p>Though the simplification can reduce the complexity of the original problem, the application of non-causal energy management still cannot be implemented in the real-time application, if the complete mission profile is not priori-known. Therefore the causal control is introduced to the energy management of hybrid propulsion system. In addition to the optimization algorithm, the causal energy management can also refer to the rule-based control. The rule-based energy management and optimization-based causal one are illustrated in the following text.Though the simplification can reduce the complexity of the original problem, the application of non-causal energy management still cannot be implemented in the real-time application, if the complete mission profile is not priori-known.

        <p>The rule-based control is comprised of a series of logic statements, which can determine the modes of operation only dependent on past and current system states. Therefore it is easily implemented as the real-time supervisory control. The rule-based control can be further subcategorized into deterministic rule-based and fuzzy rule-based one.The rule-based control is comprised of a series of logic statements, which can determine the modes of operation only dependent on past and current system states.

        <p>The deterministic rule-based control employs the classic set theory and elements to define different modes of operation. The transitions between those modes are determined by the logic rules. The rules are normally designed based on the operation states of the engine, such as the most efficient point, 112 engine optimal operation line 113 and engine peak efficiency region. 114 Hung and Gonzalez firstly introduced the concept of Ideal Operating Line (IOL) to the rule-based control of hybrid electric UAVs. 26 If the IOL consists of low fuel consumption points, the UAV should be able to achieve reduced fuel usage but without guarantee of the optimality. Normally, the deterministic rules-based strategy is simple and easy to apply in hybrid aerial vehicles, but not robust to the model uncertainties and measurement disturbances. 115 Fuzzy Logic Control: Unlike the classical rule-based control, the Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) deals with reasoning using an approximate way rather than the precise way. As a result, the FLC is tolerant to imprecise measurements and variations, thereby being robust against system uncertainties. 116 As early as the 1990s, Lee and Sul 117 applied the fuzzy logic decision-making to generate motor torque command of the hybrid powertrain of a city bus. With regards to hybrid aircraft, the fuzzy based energy management is also preferred to the deterministic rule-based one due to its robustness. A fuzzy control was designed to hybridize the power of fuel cell and battery for a UAV. 118,119 By practicing it to several testbench based experiments, the fuzzy strategy was validated to be superior to another two online strategies and consumed the least amount of hydrogen fuel. 118 Though the fuzzy logic based methods were applied and proved to be insensitive to model uncertainties and measurement noises, it still cannot give any necessary or sufficient conditions for the control to be optimal. For a fuel cell/battery hybrid aerial vehicle, Karunarathne et al. proposed to combine the neuro network inference and fuzzy control to improve the adaptivity of power management. 120,121The deterministic rule-based control employs the classic set theory and elements to define different modes of operation.

        <p>The optimization-based strategy becomes more and more attracting, as its optimality can be, to some extent, supported by the theoretical basis. The difference between the non-causal and causal optimization is that the latter one does not need the future information.

        <p>Pontryagin's Maximum Principle: The Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) can find the best possible control for the original non-causal problem, by solving several causal functions. The primary benefit of PMP is that it can provide the necessary condition for the solution to be the optimal control of the original non-causal problem. 122,123 Another advantage of PMP is that it can give the analytical solution of energy optimization problems. [124][125][126] Basically, the PMP can be taken as an approach of converting a non-causal optimization to the corresponding Hamiltonian function minimization.Pontryagin's Maximum Principle: The Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) can find the best possible control for the original non-causal problem, by solving several causal functions.

        <p>Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy: The Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is one of the most promising causal optimizations since proposed by Paganelli. 127 It can be considered as the extension of PMP by replacing the co-state variable with the so-called equivalence factor. 128 Then the Hamiltonian function is converted to a new objective-the equivalent consumption. This new objective has a real physical meaning as the sum of actual fuel consumption from ICE and equivalent electric energy consumption from the battery. Yet, only a few studies considered to apply the ECMS to optimize the hybrid propulsion system of aerial vehicles. Motapon et al. compared several commonly used energy management strategies and tested on a 14 kW fuel-cell hybrid aircraft. 129 Experiments demonstrated that ECMS would be favoured if the objective of optimization was to minimize the fuel consumption. When managing the energy of a Wankel-engine-powered hybrid UAV, ECMS was verified to transcend genetic algorithm in terms of less computational burden. 130 The key issue with the ECMS, when applied in real-time, is that it cannot sustain the battery SoC due to the equivalence factor being evaluated off-line. 131 As a consequence, the Adaptive-ECMS (A-ECMS) have been addressed to regulate the equivalence factor on-line. Generally, A-ECMS can be classified into two kinds. The first one is to update the original equivalence factor with a correction term regarding the SoC value. In the early study, the penalty function was already applied to regulate the SoC behaviour. 132 The control variable was corrected by the penalty function if the SoC deviates from its desired value. Currently, the commonest way to adaptively update the equivalence factor was to adopt the P or PI controller. 133,134 The input of the controller was the error between the current SoC and desired SoC. The second category of A-ECMS, sometimes, is also called as predictive ECMS, since it needs to predict the future information on-line. A neural network based velocity predictor was constructed to forecast the short-term future driving behaviours by learning the data stored in 3-D maps. 135 Instead of keeping updating the optimal equivalent factor, a new study demonstrated an approach to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the optimal equivalent factor, which were independent of drive cycles. 136Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy: The Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is one of the most promising causal optimizations since proposed by Paganelli. 127 It can be considered as the extension of PMP by replacing the co-state variable with the so-called equivalence factor. 128 Then the Hamiltonian function is converted to a new objective-the equivalent consumption.

        <p>The brief review of non-causal and causal energy management strategy for HEPS is presented above. Basically, the noncausal and causal energy management are preferred under dif-ferent circumstances. If the flight mission varies depending on the flight environment, the causal control needs to be adopted to update control variables on-line. If a specific sub-task is demanded for the part of the future flight, the non-causal control is preferred to achieve the optimal results, since all information about this sub-task is previously known. Therefore, both the non-causal and causal control are required to complete a complicated mission.The brief review of non-causal and causal energy management strategy for HEPS is presented above.

        <p>For the non-causal control, the convex programming will be studied, where a new convexification approach is needed to simplify the original non-causal problem. Currently, there still no research is conducted to apply the convex programming to the HEPS of aircraft, except that our study proposed a new convexification method. It can not only retain the feature of lossless relaxation from previous studies, but also lead to a more straightforward and explicit form of convexified problem. 137 The aforementioned causal control aims to realize the charge-sustaining strategy, 132 which is typical of hybrid ground vehicles. However, the charge-sustaining strategy is not ideal for aerial vehicle applications. 138 If the SoC is sustained at a very low level, the residual battery capacity cannot guarantee a safe landing when there is a failure of the engine; on the other hand, maintaining a high-level SoC, means full use cannot be made of the electrical energy in the battery. Therefore, for aircraft, it is better that the SoC is held within a range instead of at a specific value. The most intuitive way is to combine the ECMS with a rule-based control, 139,140 since the desired SoC requirement can be achieved using logic rules. This means, the control performance will not be heavily dependent on the selection of equivalence factor. Our study proposed to integrate the fuzzy control into the conventional ECMS. The authors did not find in the open literature articles applying fuzzy based ECMS specifically to the aircraft HEPS. 141For the non-causal control, the convex programming will be studied, where a new convexification approach is needed to simplify the original non-causal problem.

        <p>The system design generally started by first covering the analysis of the prototype aircraft. The performance requirements were evaluated on the basis of the aerodynamics of prototype airframe. The power-weight models of different sorts of engines and motors were also established and compared. Then, the hybrid aircraft design was formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. Fuel consumption and flight range/duration were considered as contradictory objectives. The multi-objective optimization (NSGA) could simultaneously minimize fuel consumption and maximize flight range, but leads to low computational efficiency. A new nondominated sort algorithm-BNDS was proposed and proved to improves the computation burden and lots of unnecessary comparisons.The system design generally started by first covering the analysis of the prototype aircraft.

        <p>The conventional ECMS was established by introducing the Hamiltonian function. It can convert the original noncausal fuel minimization problem to an equivalent causal one, but cannot sustain the battery SoC. The main contribution of this part of work is to extend the original ECMS by a fuzzy control. It was illustrated that the fuzzy based ECMS is more suitable for hybrid propulsion of aerial vehicles, compared with other ECMS based optimizations. Those ECMS based optimizations were designed for ground vehicles, with no consideration of vehicle safety if the engine fails. The fuzzy based ECMS can sustain the battery SoC among a range to guarantee the aircraft landing using the remaining electrical energy. The fuzzy based ECMS also allows the SoC to drop to the lower level if the flight mission requests high power for a short duration. In other words, the fuzzy based ECMS can not only sustain the SoC in a range around the desirable value, but also take advantage of the electrical energy source to power the aircraft.The conventional ECMS was established by introducing the Hamiltonian function.
