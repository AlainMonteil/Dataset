        <p>Access to clean drinking water is the grand challenge of the modern era and a prime component of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) [1]. On the other hand, water pollution caused by rapid industrialization and population growth has emerged as a grand environmental challenge in recent years [2,3]. Treatment and reuse of wastewater offer a unique opportunity to address both these challenges. Tremendous progress has been made in the past few decades towards the development of novel efficient, and cost-effective techniques for the removal of various pollutants from wastewater [4][5][6][7][8]. The applications of various optimization and modelling tools have also gained considerable attention in recent times for assessing performance and improving efficiency.</p>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the core and well-known branch of computer science that deals with building smart systems and resolves problems in a manner comparable to the human intelligence system. The primary motive of AI applications to a system is to enhance computer functions that are relevant to human knowledge, such as learning, problems solving, reasoning and perception [9]. AI is a fast-growing field and having real-world applications in diverse fields such as healthcare, smart cities and transportation, e-commerce, finance, and academia [10]. AI is further classified into machine learning, deep learning and data analytics. These techniques are mainly used for intelligent decision-making, blockchain, cloud computing, the internet of things and the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) [11]. AI is booming mainly due to its unique features to learn and adapt a system based on historical data and to make a decision. AI's significance is rising incessantly with time due to the integration of AI-based systems with intelligence, adaptability and intentionality in their proposed algorithms [12]. AI systems are applicable to almost all interdisciplinary fields, and they have played their potential role in various applications for optimization, classification, regression, and forecasting. AI tools are sometimes used in combination with experimental design techniques such as response surface methodology (RSM) to further enhance the precision of optimal solution prediction.</p>
        <p>The application of AI is emerging in water treatment to overcome the complications of traditional methods. In the current era, water industries are investing in artificial intelligence, and according to market research, this investment is expected to reach $6.3 billion by 2030 [13].</p>
        <p>Similarly, AI is expected to save 20 to 30 % of operational expenditures by decreasing the cost and optimizing the usage of the chemical in water treatment [14]. The applications of AI in water treatment have made the process easy due to its modest implementation, flexibility, generalization, and design simplicity. The commonly used AI techniques in water treatment are Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convoluted Neural Network (CNN), Decision Tree (DT), Feed Forward Back-Propagation Neural Network (FFBPNN), and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The applications of several hybrid techniques such as ANN-GA, MLP-ANN, ANN-PSO, PSO-GA, Back Propagation (BP)-ANN, Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP-ANN), AND Support Vector Regression (SVR)-GA have also been studied in water treatment. The availability of data is the main challenge in applications, as AI needs sufficient historical data to predict future outcomes and offer improvement in the system.</p>
        <p>Various studies demonstrated the successful applications of different AI tools for the modelling and optimization of the water treatment process, such as pollutants removal from water [15,16]. However, still, various hurdles hinder the application of AI in water purification. This review provides a critical analysis of different AI tools used for assessing the performance of the adsorption process employed for the removal of metals, dyes, organic compounds, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides, and personal care products (PCPs) from the water. The input variables that affect the process performance are also described, and the parameters that assess the efficiency of AI models are also discussed. Finally, the significant challenges in the widespread applications of AI in water treatment and recommendations for future research are also provided.</p>
        <p>The most commonly employed AI-based techniques for water treatment are shown in Fig. 1.</p>
        <p>These techniques are extensively used to manage wastewater treatment operations, water reuse, water-saving and cost reduction through prediction, diagnosis, assessment and simulation [16].</p>
        <p>k-NN is a simple machine learning technique used for regression and classification. k-NN save all the existing data and perform classification on new data points on the basis of similarity [17].</p>
        <p>For example, consider a classification problem having two categories W and Z, as shown in Fig.</p>
        <p>If a new data point occurred, having a placement issue with W and Z category, the new data point should be placed in a suitable category based on calculating Euclidean distance. Therefore, the new point will be added to category Z that have the maximum number of neighbours. k-NN is the most commonly used technique used for classification problem.</p>
        <p>DT technique is mainly used by AI experts for classification and regression problems. The core purpose of DT is to generate a training model used for class prediction by including "learning simple decision rules". It follows a tree structure in which each tree has a node that represents the attribute or feature of the data, the edge represents the probable answers to a problem, and the leaf node denotes the real output or class label [18]. This technique is mostly favoured because of its high accuracy and easy implementation. As depicted in Fig. 3, the process may result in many possible solutions. In a DT technique, all features of a problem are considered from root to leaf node in order to detect the optimal solution based on defined conditions.</p>
        <p>RF is used for both classification and regression problems. Just like the forest, more decision trees means that robust will be the RF. It creates DTs on data samples, and then make a prediction on each DT and lastly, choose the optimal solution based on the voting mechanism [19]. The benefit of using RF is that it decreases the overfitting of the DTs by averaging their result. As shown in Fig. 4; the random samples from a given dataset are chosen, and a decision tree is built for each sample. Then, the result of each decision tree is obtained. The next step is to perform the voting process for each predicted result and decide the most voted predicted result as a final result.</p>
        <p>ANNs are the statistical models that are built based on biological human brain neuron to perform parallel and complex computations. It is used mainly for pattern recognition problems to execute modelling and processing nonlinear relationships between the inputs and outputs in a parallel manner. In ANNs, the neuron represents a node, and the activation functions such as sigmoid and hyperbolic are used to perform nonlinear computation [20]. ANNs includes weights between neurons (nodes) that can be changed with respect to a machine learning algorithm by using a suitable cost function to learn from the observed data in order to improve the model. ANNs consists of many layers in which the first layer represents an input layer, the last layer represents the output layer, and the layers present between the first and last layers are the hidden layers. An increase in the number of hidden layers can build complex models that can be trained to improve the performance of ANNs [21]. Fig. 5 shows a simple architecture of ANNs, including the input layer (a, b, c…n), two hidden layers (hidden layer 1 and 2), and the output layers (a, b…. n). The subtypes of ANNs are discussed below.</p>
        <p>FNN is an AI technique developed from the grouping of two fields, fuzzy logic and neural network. FNN detects parameters of a fuzzy system, including fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules, by manipulating the approximation techniques from neural networks. FNN is mainly used for pattern recognition, regression and density estimation in a condition where no mathematical model exists for a specified problem [22].</p>
        <p>CNN is a commonly used class of ANNs that utilize the convolution as an alternative to general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers and generally known as the feed-forward neural network (FFNN) [23]. CNN is mainly used for image/video recognition and classification, financial time series and natural language processing. Three basic concepts that are used for CNN are "local sparse connections amongst consecutive layers, weight sharing and pooling" [24]. The first two concepts are used for reducing the number of training parameters, and pooling is using for feature size reduction [25]. The typical architecture of CNN is presented in Fig. 6.</p>
        <p>CNN is composed of two parts: the hidden layers (convolutional and pooling layers), responsible for complex feature extraction, and the classification layers (fully connected and output layers), which is responsible for giving the decision based on parameter learned from the previous layers. DNN includes multiple hidden layers along with input and output layers [23,26], as shown in Fig. 7. DNN is commonly used for learning complex models and high dimensional data process with the inclusion of more hidden layers and neurons. However, DNN needs additional computing resources and upsurge training difficulties. As compared to other ANNs, DNN provides the best performance if the datasets have enough data [27].</p>
        <p>RNN is like other ANNs except that it has an additional memory-state to the neurons to share the same parameters. RNN is an FFNN in which the information is transferred from the input layer to the output layer. It saves the output of a specific layer and connecting back to the input for the purpose to predict the output. RNN uses their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs with variable-length. The commonly used RNN is long short-term memory (LSTM) that has three gates (the input, output and forger gate) to calculate the hidden state [28]. A simple example of RNN is shown in Fig. 8, where nodes in various layers of the neural network are compressed to create RNN of a single layer. The parameters in the proposed RNN are X, Y and Z.</p>
        <p>SVM is a renowned AI-based technique that is used for solving classification and regression problems. It needs labelled training data for each category to identify the next step. The basic concept of SVM is to map the input vector into a high dimensional feature space. The mapping is obtained through different kernel functions such as linear, polynomial and radial basis functions, while the function selection is based on datasets [29]. The main purpose of SVM is to differentiate the two classes in the feature space to increase the margin between classes by drawing a hyperplane (as shown in Fig. 9). SVM is mainly used in pattern recognition problems.</p>
        <p>For example, Fig. 9 represents the classification of SVM consisting of two classes linear separable via hyperplane. Each class include one support-vector.</p>
        <p>SOM is the commonly used AI technique of ANN models. SOM consists of input and output layers. The output layer is also called a feature map or map layer. SOM is mainly used for data clustering and dimensionality reduction, as shown in Fig. 10. Weights are directly assigned to the output layer, and every SOM is assigned a weight vector with a similar dimension as the input space. Dimensionality reduction helps to reduce the input variables in a dataset because more features create difficulty in predictive modelling and make it more challenging [30].</p>
        <p>GA is a heuristic-based search algorithm that acts on a population of possible solutions similar to the biological mechanism of population genetics and selection. It uses a recursive process to achieve the best solution through multiple solutions. In GA, all the possible solutions are encoded as a gene that consists of characters in the form of strings from some alphabets. The new solutions are generated through mutation from the members of the present population, and finally, via mating, two solutions are combined to form a new solution. This algorithm is mainly used to search space for potential solutions and to find the best one by solving a problem [31].</p>
        <p>PSO is a commonly used AI-based technique for optimization problems due to its iteration mechanism to improve the solution related to a given quality measure. In PSO, the particles are moving around the search space by considering the velocity and position of the particle. In search space, each particle movement is inclined towards the best-known position, and its position and velocity are updated with time [32]. Every particle is searching for the best position in the search space by changing the velocity according to the defined rule [33].</p>
        <p>Various studies reported the applications of AI techniques for the modelling and optimization of the water treatment process, such as pollutants removal from water. Tables 345summarizes the commonly used AI techniques employed for the adsorptive removal of metals, dyes, organic compounds, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides, and PCPs from the water.</p>
        <p>AI techniques were effective in establishing a relationship between variables in water treatment.</p>
        <p>For example, in the adsorption of pollutants, the commonly used input variables are the initial concentration of the pollutant, adsorbent dosage, time, pH, agitation rate and temperature, while the output variable is mainly the removal efficiency (%) and the adsorption capacity [34]. The results predicted from the models are validated using R 2 (coefficient of determination), MSE (mean squared error), SSE (sum of squared error) and RMSE (root-mean-square error) values. In most cases, the model results were in close agreement with the experimental results.</p>
        <p>Some studies also predicted the simultaneous removal of multi-pollutants from the water with the aid of AI [35]. These findings suggest the potential applications of AI in improving the efficiency of real water treatment systems. Beside batch adsorption, AI techniques can also be employed to predict the removal performance of the adsorbents in column studies [36,37].</p>
        <p>Several studies reported the application of AI models to predict and validate the adsorption performance of various adsorbents for the removal of dyes (Table 2). Most of the studies reported the removal of a single dye; however, some researchers also studied the removal of multiple dyes [38][39][40][41]. Likewise, tough simulated wastewater is used in most cases, some researchers employed real textile wastewater to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent and the model used. The R 2 values, in most cases, were greater than 0.99 that suggest the applicability of AI in evaluating the performance of the adsorption process.</p>
        <p>The removal of methyl orange (MO), crystal violet (CV), methylene blue (MB), sunset yellow (SY), malachite green (MG), eosin yellow (EY), auramine O (AO), brilliant green (BG), eosin B (EB), acid yellow 41 (AY41), and acid red 57 (AR57) using various adsorbents was successfully modelled using the ANN, and the adsorption capacity was in close agreement with the experimental values [38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47]. The ANN models were also useful to predict the adsorption performance of the adsorbent for the simultaneous uptake of dyes in a binary and multi-dye system [41,[47][48][49].</p>
        <p>The application of AI techniques for evaluating the removal of heavy metals using various adsorbents is presented in Table 3. Although some researchers reported the simultaneous adsorption of multiple metals from the aqueous phase, most of the studies are focused on single metal adsorption [50,51]. The typical inputs variables were pH, adsorbent dosage, initial metal concentration, contact time and temperature. In column studies, the effect of internal column diameter, flow rate, bed depth of column was also evaluated in addition to the above parameters [52].</p>
        <p>The adsorption performance of different adsorbents for the removal of Cr(III), Cr(IV), Cu(II), Pb(II), As(III), Zn(II), Cd(II), and Hg(II) by different adsorbents was determined by the using various AI tools, mainly ANN [53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] Some studies also employed the AI tools to assess the performance of adsorption for the simultaneous removal of multiple metals from aqueous phase [62] 13]. Studies also evaluated the performance of various adsorbents for the removal of dyes in a continuous system using AI tools [63].</p>
        <p>Table 4 summarizes the applications of AI tools for the removal of organic compounds, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides, and PCPs from the aqueous phase [64][65][66][67][68]. ANN was the commonly used model to predict the performance evaluation of the adsorption of these pollutants. A comparison of the experimental and modelling results suggested that the AI models can safely predict the adsorption capacity or removal efficiency of the adsorbents. The commonly studied organic compounds, nutrients, pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides, and PCPs are cephalexin, chlorothalonil pesticide, heptachlor, triamterene, chlorophenol (CP), paracetamol, phenol, and phosphate [64,65,67,[69][70][71][72][73]. Besides batch experiments, the performance of various column studies was also evaluated using AI tools [74].</p>
        <p>The proposed ANN model for the adsorption of MB [75], metals (Pb(II) and Cu(II)) [77], and phenol and 3-amino-phenol [76] is presented in Fig. 12 (a-c), while Fig. 12d represents the hybrid architecture (ANN-DE) topology employed to assess zinc removal by activated carbon [78]. The significant parameters that affect the removal process were used as input variables, while the removal efficiency was the output.</p>
        <p>The predicted data versus experimental results for training and testing data for the adsorption of dyes is presented in Fig. 13 (a,b) [46].</p>
        <p>Recently AI hybrid techniques have also emerged as efficient approaches and employed extensively in water treatment for predicting the removal of various pollutants [80]. Similarly, different AI hybrids and data analytics techniques have been used for water quality analysis, process optimization, prediction, and autonomous decision making [81]. The AI hybrid 5 summarizes the applications of AI hybrid techniques for the removal of various pollutants from the water.</p>
        <p>AI tools have offered serval advantages over conventional mathematical modelling. It can be used to predict the performance of various water treatment process and reduce the experimental costs. However, still, there are some limitations that hindered the widespread applications of these techniques in real water treatment.</p>
        <p>The major drawback of AI tools such as ANNs is the poor reproducibility due to random weight and bias that might result in a locally optimal solution [16,148]. The hybridization of various AI tools can also be employed to predict pollutant removal efficiency during the adsorption process.</p>
        <p>Deep learning and deep ANNs are good options for achieving high accuracy and prediction.</p>
        <p>However, it requires a sufficient amount of data for experimental training, testing, finding the local minima and overfitting.</p>
        <p>The process performance predicted by AI tools may also deviate from the actual results under certain circumstances. For example, a sudden change in operating parameters and water quality may result in wrong prediction by AI tools. Efforts must be made to strengthen the prediction of AI tools so that they can be employed under various circumstances and can accommodate sudden fluctuation in the input variables. Based on the available literature, the AI tools have demonstrated tremendous performance for modelling the batch adsorption process with a smaller range of data. However, the applications of AI tools in practical wastewater treatment with a wide range of data is yet to be explored.</p>
        <p>Another major challenge relevant to AI-based water treatment is the availability and selection of data. The water utilities are acquired to generate, collect, process, evaluate and analyze data by creating datasets for system optimization and prediction. Special attention must be given to select the training data for AI tools, an experimental design technique, as the random data selection is associated with certain drawbacks. However, the experimental design techniques (such as RSM) usually require a large input dataset to create an accurate response.</p>
        <p>The operational data from real water treatment plants can be used as input for AI models, and the removal of pollutants can be predicted more accurately. AI technology could play a critical role in sustainable wastewater treatment and can result in a significant reduction in operating cost in addition to safeguarding the environment. Besides predicting the water treatment process efficiency, AI tools can be used to integrate the whole process of water treatment starting from water discharge, transportation, management of sludge, environmental impacts, economy and policymaking. Data collection from the various water treatment process is necessary to apply AI techniques in the water treatment domain successfully. However, special care should be taken while collecting the data to keep data integrity. All the information, such as data sources, location, process environment, and dataset ontology, should be listed while reporting the data. This information will help researchers, students, and engineers to reuse the data in the various experimental domain for future prediction.</p>
        <p>AI provides an opportunity for the water industry to optimize and govern water monitoring and management. The development of new AI-based algorithms is needed to address certain problems in water treatment and management, such as water quality, leakage detection, and water process optimization, to provide intelligent decisions. By applying hybrid AI techniques, prediction accuracy can be enhanced that leads to a reduction in energy and operational cost.</p>
        <p>A benchmark/framework should be developed to compare various AI-based stand-alone and hybrid techniques in the field of water treatment and to suggest the best techniques for applications in real treatment processes.</p>
        <p>AI has transformative potentials to revolutionize the wastewater treatment process. This review summarized the major AI tools employed in water treatment for the uptake of various pollutants.</p>
        <p>Numerous AI models (both single and hybrid) have successfully predicted the performance of different adsorbents for the removal of dyes, metals, organic compounds, pharmaceuticals, drugs, pesticides and PCPs from water. Despite several advantages offered by AI tools, there are still some shortcoming that needs to be overcome to fully utilize the potential of AI tools in practical water treatment applications. Selection of suitable data, applications of hybrid AI tools, and more studies at the pilot plant level will be helpful to address these challenges. Regardless of these hurdles, the current research progress suggests that AI tools have a bright future in water treatment applications.</p>
        <p>2.9. AI hybrid techniques</p>
        <p>AI</p>
        <p>hybrid techniques are a combination of more than one AI technique. Researchers have already employed various hybrid techniques in different fields to get the combined advantages of individual techniques. Fig. 11 shows four main techniques, GA, PSO, RNN and SVM, that are commonly used in combination with other techniques to attain a more accurate result. Some of the commonly employed hybrid techniques reported in the literature are GA-Multi Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLPANN), GA-Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Network (RBANN), GA-Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) , GA-Fuzzy Logic (FL), SVM-Simulated Annealing (SA), SVM-Adaptive Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (ASAGA), ANN-Differential Evolution (DE), ANN-Genetic Algorithm Neural Network(GANN), PSO-Wavelet Neural Network (WNN), and PSO-Elman Neural Network (ENN).
