        <p>Selenium (Se) is an important micronutrient for living organisms, since it is involved in several physiological and metabolic processes. Se intake in humans is often low and very seldom excessive, and its bioavailability depends also on its chemical form, with organic Se as the most available after ingestion. The main dietary source of Se for humans is represented by plants, since many species are able to metabolize and accumulate organic Se in edible parts to be consumed directly (leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, and sprouts) or after processing (oil, wine, etc.). Countless studies have recently investigated the Se biofortification of plants to produce Se-enriched foods and elicit the production of secondary metabolites, which may benefit human health when incorporated into the diet. Moreover, feeding animals Se-rich diets may provide Se-enriched meat. This work reviews the most recent literature on the nutraceutical profile of Se-enriched foods from plant and animal sources.Selenium (Se) is an important micronutrient for living organisms, since it is involved in several physiological and metabolic processes.

        <p>Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient, and an adequate intake of this essential trace element is thought to be beneficial for maintaining human health. 1 It is present in several natural kingdoms, humans, animals, cyanobacteria, 2 and some plants; it contributes to the control of water status of plants, 3 prevents oxidative stress, delays senescence, and promotes growth. 4,5 More than 25 selenium-containing proteins have been identified in mammals and are distributed in different tissues and cells, 6 having in all cases a role in the regulation of redox processes. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is the most studied and well characterized selenoprotein, and its involvement in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been clearly demonstrated. Similar activity was reported for thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and selenoprotein P, whereas the analogues K, M, N, and H have a number of different roles in the maintenance of the redox homeostasis of living systems, and iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO) have a fundamental role in the activation of the thyroid hormones. 7 All these proteins have as a common characteristic the presence of a selenocysteine 21st amino acid in which the catalytic core is a selenol/selenolate stabilized by a amino acidic triad. 8 Included in the biological processes that can be modulated by Se are not only the cellular response to oxidative stress but also the cellular differentiation, function (including enterocytes and adipocytes), immune response; the redox signaling and protein folding; and the regulation of insulin action and secretion. 9 ICP MS can be used for the quantification of Se species, 129 owing to its high sensitivity and element-specific analytical 130 response, independent of the molecular structure, even in case of unidentified Se species. At first sight, it seems there is a full compatibility between HPLC and the traditional sample introduction system of ICP MS, as HPLC provides a typical flow rate in a range of 0.2-1.0 mL min -1 , which perfectly matches the flow rate range of the traditional nebulizers used (in combination with a spray chamber) for sample introduction in ICP MS. Three different ICP MS sample introduction systems (i.e., a micro concentric nebulizer mounted onto a cyclonic spray chamber, a direct injection nebulizer (DIN), and an ultrasonic nebulizer) were compared in the context of HPLC ICP MS analysis of Se species. The micro-concentric nebulizer combined with a cyclonic spray chamber was found to be the optimal sample introduction system, taking the chromatographic peak shape, sensitivity, and limits of detection (LODs) into account. Ar-based spectral interferences, while monitoring the ion signals of the 78 Se, 80 Se, and 82 Se isotopes, can be solved with methane as a reaction gas in the dynamic reaction cell (DRC) used in ICP MS to eliminate the on-mass. 27 The quantification accuracy of Se species can be increased by isotopic dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS). The principle of IDMS is based on the alteration of the isotopic ratio of the analyte's two or more isotopes, by spiking the sample with an isotopically enriched standard. By applying relevant mathematical equations for IDMS and measuring the altered isotopic ratio, the concentration in the sample can be obtained.

        <p>The identification of Se metabolites can usually be achieved by using traditional techniques, MS and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Electrospray ionization (ESI) in MS is often used either in tandem with ICP MS or as a complementary detector. ESI is a soft ionization mode that can preserve the molecular form of biomolecules, and since its implementation into analytical methods, this instrument has proven to be invaluable for the structural elucidation of molecular species. On the other hand, ESI MS also enables fragmentation of selected molecules, and produced fragments are very often crucial in the identification of unknown molecular species. The identification of novel Se species has been exclusively done by ESI MS, with high molecular mass precision, when high resolution instruments such as Orbitrap, ESI, time of flight (TOF) MS, or ESI MS/MS are used. 25 In addition, the growing sensitivity of ICP MS detection, owing to collision cell and triple quadrupole mass spectrometers, has resulted in an increasing number of unidentified peaks in HPLC and ICP MS chromatograms.The identification of Se metabolites can usually be achieved by using traditional techniques, MS and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).

        <p>On the level of selenoproteins, bioinformatics approaches have allowed the putative description of selenoproteomes (sets of Se-containing proteins with genetically introduced selenocystein via a SeCys element). In parallel, the increasing fertilizer form, crop species, and variety and growth stage, to name a few. Indeed, Se species distribution in soils shows that, after irrigation, selenate can be considered as an easily available short-term pool of Se for plants. The long-term pool of Se in the topsoil mainly consists of selenite and organic Se species. These species are readily retained but still sufficiently mobile to be taken up by plants. The formation of elemental Se can be considered as a nonavailable Se pool and is thus the major cause of Se immobilization and long-term enrichment of Se in soils. 28 In this sense, two years of selenite fertigation in maize (Zea mays L.) increased the content of inorganic and organic Se forms, 18 while irrigation did not affect Se concentration. In rice, selenite uptake promoted organic Se accumulation, but this was mainly stored in roots, a nonedible part of the plant. On the contrary, selenate uptake resulted in the accumulation of selenate in the higher part of the shoots, which is an essential requirement for Se to be transported to the grain. 29 Foliar application is a valid alternative for Se enrichment of agricultural products. 30 Compared to Se fertilization to the soil, foliar application by-passes any interference due to soil chemistry and microbiology issues, ensuring a higher efficacy even with low volumes of Se solution. Foliar application of selenite or selenate has been successfully performed to increase the Se content in many crops. 30,31 Furthermore, the technique paves the road toward the enrichment of plants by costly stable isotopes, which are useful tools in plant physiology research.On the level of selenoproteins, bioinformatics approaches have allowed the putative description of selenoproteomes (sets of Se-containing proteins with genetically introduced selenocystein via a SeCys element).

        <p>In hydroponic systems, as it may be the case in the production of soil-less vegetables and microscale vegetables, Se can be supplied to the water or the nutrient solution. 32,33 As far as the plant growth stage is concerned, Se may be applied all at once or repeatedly and from sowing to stem elongation, with different outcomes in terms of Se accumulation and partitioning among plant organs. 34,35 At the vegetative stage, root application of selenomethylselenocysteine (SeMeSeCys) caused the highest water extractable Se content in leaves with major a contribution from organic Se species such as Se amino acid and non-amino acid organic Se. Further investigation at the reproductive stage revealed that foliar application of selenite resulted in the highest total Se content in rice seeds, which was largely attributed to inorganic Se. In contrast, the root application of selenite led to the maximum accumulation of organic Se compounds, which are the most beneficial to human health. 36 The application of Se during the booting stage resulted in the highest concentration of Se in brown rice due to the highest upward translocation of Se. More than 90% of Se in brown rice was accounted for by organic species, mainly SeMet. The proportion of SeMet in the brown rice decreased with the delay in application time. 37 In potatoes, foliar application of selenite during the tuber bulking stage was appropriate for the production of Se-rich potatoes. 34 In broccoli, Se fortification at developmental stages increased SeMeSeCys content. 38 Finally, the environmental factors (soil characteristics, rainfall, and temperature regimes, etc.) and the cultivation practices (sowing date, fertilization and irrigation schedules, use of growth stimulators, etc.) may greatly affect the Se uptake and partitioning among plant organs. Moreover, both environmental stresses and Se may interfere in affecting the content of secondary metabolites in plant tissues.In hydroponic systems, as it may be the case in the production of soil-less vegetables and microscale vegetables, Se can be supplied to the water or the nutrient solution. 32,33 As far as the plant growth stage is concerned, Se may be applied all at once or repeatedly and from sowing to stem elongation, with different outcomes in terms of Se accumulation and partitioning among plant organs. 34,35 At the vegetative stage, root application of selenomethylselenocysteine (SeMeSeCys) caused the highest water extractable Se content in leaves with major a contribution from organic Se species such as Se amino acid and non-amino acid organic Se.

        <p>For all the aforementioned reasons, reviewing the literature available on Se-biofortified foods is not easy, and any effort to regroup treatments and effects may give arbitrary interpreta-human diet seems to be excessive compared to the little evident nutritional benefits.For all the aforementioned reasons, reviewing the literature available on Se-biofortified foods is not easy, and any effort to regroup treatments and effects may give arbitrary interpreta-human diet seems to be excessive compared to the little evident nutritional benefits.</p>
        <p>For spinach, the only total Se concentration values suitable for human nutrition were those reported by Ferrarese et al., 50 who found concentrations in the leaves ranging from 9.3 to 15.5 μg of Se kg -1 DW (Table 4). The only benefit of Se fortification shown in these works was an increase of the antioxidant capacity, and actually, an increase of growth parameters has been found to occur only with Se doses 51 too high to be used for products suitable for human consumption.For spinach, the only total Se concentration values suitable for human nutrition were those reported by Ferrarese et al., 50 who found concentrations in the leaves ranging from 9.3 to 15.5 μg of Se kg -1 DW (Table 4).

        <p>The studies on basil showed that the benefits due to Se fortification included an enhancement of carotenoids, soluble phenols, proline, and anthocyanin, 52,53 whereas contrasting effects on biomass increase have been highlighted. 53,54 The essential oil content was not influenced by Se fortification. 55 The nutritional benefits obtained from the biofortification of basil have been achieved with doses of Se too high to be compatible with human nutrition. However, this plant material, which is rich in carotenoids, soluble phenols, proline, and anthocyanin, could be used by mixing it with similar untreated plant material to obtain a Se content suitable for human diet. 52,53 The studies on chicory evidenced an increase in plant yield and antioxidant compounds, such as ascorbic acid and total phenolics.The studies on basil showed that the benefits due to Se fortification included an enhancement of carotenoids, soluble phenols, proline, and anthocyanin, 52,53 whereas contrasting effects on biomass increase have been highlighted. 53,54 The essential oil content was not influenced by Se fortification. 55 The nutritional benefits obtained from the biofortification of basil have been achieved with doses of Se too high to be compatible with human nutrition.

        <p>Interestingly, of the beneficial Se amino acids, SeMetSeCys was the only one identified in radish plants. This compound has recognized anticarcinogenic properties; thus its accumulation in radish roots is a valuable result. Plants sprayed with Se produced more SeMetSeCys compared to plants grown in hydroponics. The contents of Cys, polyphenols, and glutathione in Se-treated plants were higher than in the untreated plants. Concerning cabbage, both the total Se content and some nutritional traits of the edible parts increased after Se biofortification; in florets, Banũelos et al. 56 found higher percentages of Se organic compounds (such as SeMet and MeSeCys) than those of Se inorganic compounds. Also, S ̌indelaŕǒváet al. 57 found the presence of Se organic compounds, such as SeMet and SeMetSeCys, in all the parts of the Se-biofortified plants and reported that Se accumulated mainly in the flower heads. Mechora et al. 58 reported that the main soluble species in the Se-biofortified plants was SeMet, even if the major amount of Se was in insoluble forms (31-53%). Ramos et al. 59 reported that half of the total Se accumulated in leaves was SeMetSeCys and SeMet, the total glucosinolate contents were not affected by the concentration of selenate application, and the total antioxidant capacity of plants was greatly stimulated by selenate. Mechora et al. 60 reported that selenate addition had no effect on the amounts of anthocyanins or chlorophyll. Leafy crops are the most suitable for fortification studies; they require little time to reach maturity, they can be grown in pots, and they easily allow for the evaluation of the dose of the element that will be present in the edible part. Among all the leafy crops mentioned above, the most suitable for Se biofortification seem to belong to the Brassicaceae family. Since these are Se-hyperaccumulating plants, the main concern could be the risk of excessive doses of Se in the edible parts. However, as demonstrated by the total Se concentration values found by Mechora et al. 58,60 and S ̌indelaŕǒváet al. 57 on cabbage grown in fields and fertilized with Se by soil addition or foliar spray, it should not be difficult Table 2. Legumes: Crop Species, Se Treatment (Se Source, Dose and Application Mode), and Effects on Total (TSeC) and Organic Se Content and Other Nutritional Traits Se-biofortification studies were also carried out on plants 386 whose edible parts were tuber, bulb, or root (potato, garlic, 387 shallot, and carrot), and the obtained results are reported in t6 388 Table 6.Interestingly, of the beneficial Se amino acids, SeMetSeCys was the only one identified in radish plants.

        <p>As far as the nutritional benefits are concerned, selenate was 390 the most efficient source for Se biofortification of tubers; 34 the 391 accumulation of inorganic Se was higher in tubers treated with 392 selenate (31.9% of the total Se content) than in those treated 393 with selenite (1.5%). 34 However, selenate was markedly 394 inferior to selenite in terms of the organic transformation 395 rate of Se. 34 Selenate and SeMet were the main soluble Se 396 species in potato tubers. 61 In tubers, plant application of Se 397 increased the relative content of total essential and 398 nonessential amino acids compared to the controls (phenyl-399 alanine was enhanced particularly). 62 When applied in small 400 doses, Se provided beneficial effects on the tuber production, 401 activated enzymes of the antioxidant system, 63 and delayed 402 aging of the stolons and roots, contributing to an increased 403 shelf life of potatoes. 61 At harvest, the starch concentration in 404 tubers did not change. 61 In garlic, foliar spray was more 405 effective than soil application. A significant increase in total 406 phenolics, total flavonoids, and total antioxidant capacity was 407 observed in bulbs. 64 Concerning shallots, it was reported that 408 Se biofortification combined with pretreatment of an 409 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)-based formulate increased 410 the bulb Se content by 530%, while Se biofortification with 411 selenocystine (SeCys 2 ) and selenate increased this value by 412 36% and 21%, respectively, compared to the control. The 413 values of bulb quality indicators, macro-and microelements, 414 ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity increased upon AMF 415 inoculation; 65 both selenite and selenate positively affected 416 most of the quality attributes and macroelements as well as the 417 contents of Se and ascorbic acid. For carrots, inorganic Se, 418 SeMet, and γ-glutamil-SeMet-SeCys were the predominant Se 419 forms in roots. 66 420 In Italy, potatoes, onions, and carrots containing low 421 concentrations of Se (suitable for human diet) are already in 422 trade and are produced by the Italian Potatoes of Quality 423 Consortium, with headquarters in Bologna. 30 Since tubers, 424 bulbs, and roots are poor but nutritious foods, improving their 425 nutritional characteristics even by increasing their content of 426 Se in organic forms appears relevant for the wellness of 427 populations of the poorest areas of the world. .As far as the nutritional benefits are concerned, selenate was 390 the most efficient source for Se biofortification of tubers; 34 the 391 accumulation of inorganic Se was higher in tubers treated with 392 selenate (31.9% of the total Se content) than in those treated 393 with selenite (1.5%). 34 However, selenate was markedly 394 inferior to selenite in terms of the organic transformation 395 rate of Se. 34 Selenate and SeMet were the main soluble Se 396 species in potato tubers. 61 In tubers, plant application of Se 397 increased the relative content of total essential and 398 nonessential amino acids compared to the controls (phenyl-399 alanine was enhanced particularly). 62 When applied in small 400 doses, Se provided beneficial effects on the tuber production, 401 activated enzymes of the antioxidant system, 63 and delayed 402 aging of the stolons and roots, contributing to an increased 403 shelf life of potatoes. 61 At harvest, the starch concentration in 404 tubers did not change. 61 In garlic, foliar spray was more 405 effective than soil application.

        <p>As far as fruit vegetables are concerned, the plant most 429 commonly used in Se biofortification studies was tomato, t7 430 whose results are reported in Table 7. Biofortification with Se 431 seemed to cause a delay in the onset of the fruit 432 ripening. 54,67,68 This effect may be positive because it could 433 affect the postharvest shelf life of tomatoes; Zhu et al. 67 434 reported that this could be due to an inhibition of reactive 435 oxygen species (ROS) generation by stimulation of antioxidant 436 defense systems, together with a downregulation of ethylene 437 biosynthesis genes. Similarly, Puccinelli et al. 54 noticed a lower 438 respiration rate and ethylene production, associated with a 439 delayed lycopene and β-carotene synthesis and chlorophyll 440 degradation. The nutritional benefits that tomato fruits 441 acquired with Se biofortification were the presence of SeMet 442 and MetSeCys as the major forms of Se compounds in the fruits, 69 an increase of the antioxidant activity, 70,71 a slightly higher level of vitamin A, 45 and an increase in fruit firmness and fruit total solids. 70 Se biofortification of tomatoes may be interesting for fortified food producers. Also, in this case, it is essential to develop an agronomic method that allows fruits to be obtained with a dose of Se suitable for the human diet.As far as fruit vegetables are concerned, the plant most 429 commonly used in Se biofortification studies was tomato, t7 430 whose results are reported in Table 7.

The nutritional benefits that tomato fruits 441 acquired with Se biofortification were the presence of SeMet 442 and MetSeCys as the major forms of Se compounds in the fruits, 69 an increase of the antioxidant activity, 70,71 a slightly higher level of vitamin A, 45 and an increase in fruit firmness and fruit total solids. 70 Se biofortification of tomatoes may be interesting for fortified food producers. Also, in this case, it is essential to develop an agronomic method that allows fruits to be obtained with a dose of Se suitable for the human diet.</p>
        <p>Particularly interesting, from this point of view, is the fortification technique developed by Businelli et al., 45 which is as follows: (i) enrich an appropriate amount of peat in Se, (ii) sow the seeds of the selected crop species in Se-enriched peat until seedlings have the appropriate size for transplanting, (iii) transfer these Se-enriched transplants in the field.Particularly interesting, from this point of view, is the fortification technique developed by Businelli et al., 45 which is as follows: (i) enrich an appropriate amount of peat in Se, (ii) sow the seeds of the selected crop species in Se-enriched peat until seedlings have the appropriate size for transplanting, (iii) transfer these Se-enriched transplants in the field.</p>
        <p>Moreover, using this technique, the environmental spread of Se is minimized, as this element is not in any way distributed in the field, but it is only used during the pre-transplanting stage and is immediately absorbed by the seedlings. Another on-field fortification technique, suitable for obtaining a Se-fortified tomato without excessive Se concentrations, is that proposed by Andrejiováet al. 72 The Se fortification of tomatoes has potential for obtaining a table fruit with a longer shelf life and with high levels of Se-organic forms and antioxidant compounds. Another possible use could be the production of sauce; in this case, Se-fortified tomatoes could be mixed with untreated tomatoes in order to avoid excessive Se concentrations in the final product.Moreover, using this technique, the environmental spread of Se is minimized, as this element is not in any way distributed in the field, but it is only used during the pre-transplanting stage and is immediately absorbed by the seedlings.

        <p>Microscale Vegetables. Recent studies on Se biofortification were focused on "microscale vegetables", i.e., plants in early growth stages, since they are able to absorb relevant amounts of Se 73 and are naturally rich in phytochemicals. [74][75][76] Microscale vegetables differ from each other according to their corresponding growing cycle lengths, plant heights, edible portions, and other secondary traits. 74,76 This section will review only literature on sprouts (i.e., 3-5 day-old seedlings), grasses (7-12 day-old seedlings from Graminaceae species), and microgreens (5-10 day-old seedlings from all plant species except for Graminaceae species). These require a short time interval to be produced (1-3 weeks) and few inputs (i.e., t8 no soil, only water, and no or low light). 74,76 Tables 8910report the studies of the last ten years that concern the most exploited technique for Se biofortification in sprouts, grasses, and microgreens: Se is supplied by (i) the germination t9 substrate (Table 8), (ii) the soaking procedure (Table 9), and (iii) the chemical priming (Table 10). All the tables report the effect of these methods on total and organic Se content and, where studied, on phytochemicals.Microscale Vegetables.

        <p>All the procedures used for Se biofortification generally cause an increase of Se content, but results varied with the species; the growth stage; and the Se source, dose, timing of application.All the procedures used for Se biofortification generally cause an increase of Se content, but results varied with the species; the growth stage; and the Se source, dose, timing of application.</p>
        <p>The growth stage should be chosen accurately since it is related to the edible portion of the plant. In the case of sprouts, the whole seedling (shoots and roots) is edible, while in the case of microgreens and grass, only the shoot is used in human nutrition (i.e., for salads, soups, or juices). 75,76 The organ to be consumed may also depend on the form of Se used for biofortification. In fact, by using sodium selenite (Na 2 SeO 3 ), the Se might be highly accumulated in the roots (i.e., mainly as selenite), while by using sodium selenate (Na 2 SeO 4 ), the Se will be accumulated mainly in the shoots as selenate and organic Se. 29,77 The Se source used for biofortification is strongly related to the chemical form of Se consumed by nutrition. On the other hand, the chemical product containing Se is often chosen Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry 8910.The growth stage should be chosen accurately since it is related to the edible portion of the plant.

        <p>As far as the Se dose is concerned, studies are needed to individuate the optimal dose, i.e., the dose that increases Se accumulation and phytochemical concentration without compromising seedling growth in order to maximize the yield of total and organic Se and of phytochemicals. It should be noted that very high Se doses are not worthwhile since they depress plant growth and may cause very high Se concentrations, which may limit the consumption of microscale vegetables in order to not exceed the recommended daily Se intake.As far as the Se dose is concerned, studies are needed to individuate the optimal dose, i.e., the dose that increases Se accumulation and phytochemical concentration without compromising seedling growth in order to maximize the yield of total and organic Se and of phytochemicals.

        <p>Finally, the method and time of exposure for Se biofortification treatment significantly affect the final results in terms of Se and phytochemical contents. Concerning Se application via the germination solution, the common procedure consists of sowing seeds on the substrate containing different solutions of Se until the day of harvest (Table 8).Finally, the method and time of exposure for Se biofortification treatment significantly affect the final results in terms of Se and phytochemical contents.

        <p>Since the germination period may vary between 5 and 15 days, the solution in the substrate has to be restored often, especially when the trays for sprouting are open. Some authors added a specific volume of the corresponding Se solution to restore the solution content, 78,79 and others sprinkled or sprayed the Se solution at specific times. 80,81 When possible, due to the long duration of the germination period (i.e., 1521 days), some authors changed the nutrient solution containing Se. 59 The choice is also affected by the presence 78,82 or absence 77,83 of the substrate (i.e., paper, sand, etc.). Different procedures imply differences in the evolution of Se concentration in the germination substrate, and as a consequence, the results in the literature are often not comparable.Since the germination period may vary between 5 and 15 days, the solution in the substrate has to be restored often, especially when the trays for sprouting are open.

        <p>Considering the soaking (Table 9) and priming with Se (Table 10), the main variations are due to the time of exposition to the treatment. In the case of soaking, the time of treatment may vary from 4 to 24 h depending on the size of seeds, and Se content generally increases with increasing time of exposition. Studies on priming with Se did not report results concerning the content of total Se and Se proteins, probably because these studies were more focused on plant growth parameters and stress resistance than on nutritional traits.Considering the soaking (Table 9) and priming with Se (Table 10), the main variations are due to the time of exposition to the treatment.

        <p>In addition to the aforementioned techniques, the recent work of Puccinelli et al. is noteworthy, 84 in which they reported the possibility of producing Se-enriched sprouts from seeds harvested by a mother crop fertilized with Se.

        <p>Fruit Tree Crops. Despite the considerable knowledge of Se effects and accumulation on herbaceous species, little is known about trees species. In particular, the present section will focus just on Se effects on fruits and their derivates, as little evidence has been reported on Se accumulation especially in the edible fruits and their derivates (juice, wine, and oil) t11 (Table 11). The content of Se in tree plants can be increased in different ways, including soil and foliar fertilization. From the bibliography examined, it emerges that the most used modality for Se biofortification in tree plants is the foliar spray. In general, foliar spraying was preferable in comparison to soil application, since it involves a more efficient uptake of Se, an absence of residual effects, and a minimum consumption of Se salts, resulting in the most environmentally safe and economically acceptable method. 31,85 A little-explored treatment modality is that of fruit treatment. Pezzarossa et al. 86 investigated the effects of foliar and fruit spraying of sodium selenate on Se accumulation, fruit growth, and senescence in peach and pear fruit crops. Both treatments increased the fruit Se concentration, but fruit treatment was more effective than leaf treatment in increasing Se content in fruits. The daily consumption of pears and peach treated with 1 mg of Se L -1 does not induce toxicity but can even provide a rational Se supplementation for human nutrition. Se accumulated in the pear juice was almost all inorganic, so the application of selenite is considered more suitable than selenate from the viewpoint of food safety. 87 In apples and pomegranates, Se supplementation via foliar spray enhanced fruit quality. 88,89 In particular, in apples, in addition to the increase of Se content, an increase in the flesh firmness, titrable acidity, soluble solid content, and activities of antioxidant enzymes were observed, 90 while in pomegranates, Se fertilization led to an important increase of the content of phenolic compounds, antioxidants, and anthocyanins. 89 Regarding the effects of Se supplementation (100 mg L -1 via foliar spray) in table olives, D'Amato et al. 91 reported that, at harvesting time, the concentration in the edible part of the drupes delivered 6.1 μg g -1 , corresponding to 29 μg of Se per 5 olives (39 and 49% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adult men and women, respectively), and such enrichment also changed the nutritional quality of the drupes, with significant increases in the concentrations of B, Na, Mg, K, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Cu compared to the untreated control group. Therefore, in addition to Se, the consumption of 10 g of Se-enriched olives (five olives) per day per person would provide a quantity of Cu, K, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn equal to 3, 9, 1, 1, 1, and 0.5% of the RDA, respectively. 92 Se fertilization via foliar spray (50, 100, and 150 mg L -1 ) is also effective for the enrichment of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in Se content (up to 120 μg kg -1 ). 31,93 Moreover, Se fertilization increased SeMet, carotenoid, chlorophyll, and phenol content in EVOO. 93,94 In particular, the phenolic profiles showed that oleacein, ligustroside aglycone, and oleocanthal were the most affected compounds and were increased by 57, 50, and 32%, respectively. All these compounds, especially oleacein, have been shown to exert a relevant antioxidant activity, contributing to both the shelf life of EVOOs and positive effects on human health. 93 It is important to underline that foliar spray with Se may be sources are used: inorganic (mainly selenite or selenate) and organic, mainly in the form of SeMet (mainly as Se yeast or SeMet preparations). Many factors can affect the activity and efficacy of Se supplementation, such as the chemical form, animal's health, and environmental conditions. Both organic and inorganic forms are metabolized by animals, mainly as SeCys, which is the form in which Se is also consumed by humans (through animal-origin products). 99 The body of literature has reported that dietary Se supplementation increases Se concentration in the meat of rabbits, 100 lambs, 101 calves, 102 and chickens. 103,104 Se is classified as an antioxidant microelement because it is a part of the active center of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as well as a cofactor for thioredoxin reductase 105 in blood, liver, and edible tissues, 106 which might be connected with enhancing the immune response in mammals. There were several documented reports that the addition of organic Se in animal feed resulted in enhanced GPx activity and oxidative stability of meat. 107 Lipid oxidation is the main cause of deteriorating meat quality in terms of color, flavor, texture, and nutritional value. 108 Joksimovic-Todorovic et al. 109 reported that Se has an effect of preserving the texture and sensory characteristics of meat among domestic animals. Also, this type of supplementation induced a decrease in the fat and cholesterol contents in the meat (i.e., beef). 110,111 Furthermore, Se may play a role in the alteration of lipid metabolism; a decrease of the content of cholesterol in meat 693 when adding Se would be a beneficial effect of its 694 supplementation. Nevertheless, the results concerning lipid 695 decrease 111 were not consistent with those reported in other 696 studies in cattle, 112,113 rabbit, 100,114 or pigs, 115,116 for which no 697 difference was observed in lipid amount when adding Se.
