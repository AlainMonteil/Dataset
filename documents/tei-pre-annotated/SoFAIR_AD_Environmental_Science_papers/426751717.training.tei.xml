        <p>Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are a class of anthropogenic organic compounds found ubiquitously in many environmental media due to their release from commercial and industrial products (ATSDR, 2012). Widely used as flame retardants in furniture, textiles, building materials, electronics and other processing chemicals, they are also often used as plasticisers in floor polish and wax, coatings, engineering thermoplastics, and epoxy resins (Greaves and Letcher, 2014). In common with other chemical contaminants, human exposure to OPEs can potentially occur via inhalation, ingestion of food, water and/or dust, as well as through dermal contact with dust, soil and/or consumer products (ATSDR, 2012).Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are a class of anthropogenic organic compounds found ubiquitously in many environmental media due to their release from commercial and industrial products (ATSDR, 2012).

        <p>Chemically, OPEs comprise a heterogeneous class of phosphoric acid esters in which the hydrogen in the phosphate group is replaced by an alkyl, aryl, or chlorinated alkyl group (Guo et al., 2016). OPEs are usually employed as additive flame retardants (FRs) in various consumer products, i.e. they are physically added to materials rather than chemically bonded to the matrix. Applications of OPEs include use as FRs in textiles, rubber, cellulose, polyurethane foam, electronic equipment, cotton, cutting oils, etc. (Veen and de Boer, 2012).Chemically, OPEs comprise a heterogeneous class of phosphoric acid esters in which the hydrogen in the phosphate group is replaced by an alkyl, aryl, or chlorinated alkyl group (Guo et al., 2016).

        <p>Additionally, OPEs such as TPHP and TBOEP are used in unsaturated polyester resins, floor wax and stabilizers for anti-foaming and as additives to floor polishes, lubricants, lacquers and hydraulic fluids. For instance, the common chlorinated OPEs (i.e., phosphate (TCEP), tris(chloropropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and tris (1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP)) are applied in flexible and rigid PUFs (Wei et al., 2015).Additionally, OPEs such as TPHP and TBOEP are used in unsaturated polyester resins, floor wax and stabilizers for anti-foaming and as additives to floor polishes, lubricants, lacquers and hydraulic fluids.

        <p>Consequently, they are susceptible to release into the environment via leaching, volatilisation, as well as abrasion (Guo et al., 2016;Pang et al., 2017). Following release into the environment, they may accumulate in indoor environments and following release from such environments ultimately be transported over long distances by air and water (Hou et al., 2016). As a result, there has been widespread detection of OPEs in air, water, soil, indoor environments, and biota, including humans (Gao et al., 2014).Consequently, they are susceptible to release into the environment via leaching, volatilisation, as well as abrasion (Guo et al., 2016;Pang et al., 2017).

        <p>Owing to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties, several brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) (Stockholm Convention on POPs, 2013). In 2018, the global consumption of FRs reached 2.6 million tonnes and is predicted to approach 3.1 million tonnes by 2023 (BCC Research, 2018). The global production and use of OPEs has increased rapidly in recent years. It is likely therefore that the use of OPEs has increased as replacements for restricted BFRs, with worldwide consumption of OPEs projected to reach 860,000 t in 2023 from 680,000 t in 2015 to 816,000 t in 2018 (BBC Research, 2018;Wang et al., 2015). OPEs have been estimated to account for 20 % of the total consumption of FRs in Western Europe (Wei et al., 2015).Owing to their persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic properties, several brominated flame retardants (BFRs) have been listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) (Stockholm Convention on POPs, 2013).

        <p>Unfortunately, some OPEs, especially those that are chlorinated, are thought to be persistent in the environment (Lai et al., 2015), with human exposure demonstrated by their detection in human milk (Kim et al., 2014). Concerns about such exposure are compounded by toxicological studies revealing that high concentrations and prolonged exposure to OPEs can induce adverse effects including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, kidney toxicity, reproductive toxicity, liver toxicity, and endocrine disruption (Hou et al., 2016;Wei et al., 2015). The presence and concentrations of OPEs in various biotic and abiotic environmental matrices has been reviewed (Wei et al., 2015;Sugeng et al., 2017;Hou et al., 2016;Greaves and Letcher, 2017). However, information on the worldwide presence of OPEs in foodstuffs remains scant and the sources of contamination, i.e. whether the presence of OPEs in food is due to migration from food packaging, bioaccumulation, uptake from the agricultural environment, contamination during industrial processing, or some other sources, remain unclear. Currently, data on concentrations of OPEs in food is restricted to samples from China, USA, Belgium, Sweden, and Australia (Zhao et al., 2019;Zhang et al., 2016;Wang and Kannan, 2018;Poma et al., 2017;2018;He et al., 2018a), while there exists no data from other European countries, North America, South America, and Africa. It is on this premise that this critical review will: (a) discuss the pathways of human exposure to OPEs; (b) assess the current state-of-knowledge on OPEs in diet; and (c) evaluate the relative significance of dietary exposure compared to other human exposure pathways.Unfortunately, some OPEs, especially those that are chlorinated, are thought to be persistent in the environment (Lai et al., 2015), with human exposure demonstrated by their detection in human milk (Kim et al., 2014).

        <p>The search for research articles, reviews, book, conference proceedings and other online resources was carried out between November 20, 2018 to October 20, 2020 using the following electronic databases: Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science core collection. The search terms used were: ''organophosphate esters (OPEs)'', ''organophosphorus flame retardants'' ''foodstuffs'' and ''human exposure'' and only articles published between 2014 and 2020 were selected. ScienceDirect and Scopus returned a total of 2506 and 1105 publications respectively, with a further 554 articles located on Web of Sciences core collection. Further screening based on suitability of the titles and abstracts of articles, identified 121 full-text articles from ScienceDirect, 95 full text articles from Scopus and 103 full-text articles from Web of Science core collection respectively. After duplicate studies (n = 130) were removed, 189 publications were left for further screening. After full text screening, 114 articles were excluded based on factors such as article not written in English, full text not available, as well the nature of the samples analysed, the sampling methodology, statistical data presented, articles with no human exposure data and those not related to risk assessment of OPEs. This left 75 articles consisting of 66 research papers, 5 review papers and four official reports. In addition, screening of references cited in these 75 articles, identified a further 15 publications (comprising 14 research articles and one official report published before 2014). In total therefore, 90 articles were included in this review.The search for research articles, reviews, book, conference proceedings and other online resources was carried out between November 20, 2018 to October 20, 2020 using the following electronic databases: Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science core collection.

        <p>Several key physicochemical properties essentially define the environmental behaviour and fate of OPEs; in particular, their availability for uptake by biota and routes of human exposure (Table S1). As well as the ambient temperature experienced by OPE-treated materials, emissions of OPEs via volatilisation will depend on their vapour pressure and concentrations in the treated products (Carlsson et al., 1997;Ni et al., 2007). Meanwhile, the extent of OPE bioaccumulation is dependent on their octanol: water partition coefficient (KOW) and the rate at which they metabolise in biota (Regnery and Püttmann, 2010). For example, halogenated OPEs were reported to be more persistent in the environment and more resistant to degradation than alkyl and aryl OPEs (Marklund et al., 2005;Bester, 2006).Several key physicochemical properties essentially define the environmental behaviour and fate of OPEs; in particular, their availability for uptake by biota and routes of human exposure (Table S1).

        <p>The three main pathways via which humans are exposed to chemicals, are ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption. These broad categories may further be broken down into sub-categories such as ingestion of dust, food, and drink, as well as dermal uptake resulting from contact with dust and with products containing chemicals. The relative contribution that each pathway makes to overall exposure depends inter alia on the physicochemical properties and commercial applications of the chemicals, as well as lifestyle and demographic factors related to the exposed individual. Evidence to date has demonstrated that human exposure to OPEs can occur via dermal contact (Abdallah et al., 2016), ingestion of contaminated dust (Abdallah and Covaci, 2014), inhalation of air (Schreder et al., 2016), and more recently diet (Poma et al. 2018;Zhao et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). S2), with a summary of estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of OPEs through air inhalation reported in various studies presented in Table S3. Schreder et al. (2016) observed that estimated exposure to OPEs via inhalation exceeded estimated exposure from dust ingestion. Adult inhalation intake of TCIPP was estimated at 4540 ng/day, which was 31 times that from dust ingestion for TCIPP in the studied population (Schreder et al., 2016). Moreover, in a study carried out examining exposure via indoor air inhalation, dust ingestion, and dermal uptake in Albany, New York, USA; Kim et al. (2019) reported TCIPP (27-43 %) and triethyl phosphate (TEP) (11-33 %) were the two major contributors of total human exposure via inhalation. In a similar study carried out by Cao et al. (2019), inhalation was shown to be one of the main human exposure routes for volatile OPEs such as tri iso-butyl phosphate (TiBP), TnBP, TCIPP, and TEP. Moreover, in a study of exposure occurring via air inhalation, indoor dust ingestion and dermal uptake, Zhou et al. (2017) reported that under a median exposure scenario, air inhalation contributed 5.7 ng ΣOPEs.kg bw -1 .day -1 representing 73 % of total exposure for German adults.

Xu et al. (2016) showed that inhalation is the major exposure pathway for low molecular weight, relatively more volatile OPEs, like TCEP and TCIPP, while dust ingestion is the main route for less volatile OPEs such as TBOEP, TPHP, and tris(methylphenyl)phosphate (TMPP). material (Table S4), while EDIs from ingestion of indoor dust are collated in Table S5. Several 172 studies have showed that ingestion of dust (indoor and outdoor) is an important human 173 exposure pathway to OPEs (Brommer et al., 2012;2015;Abdallah and Covaci et al., 2014; assuming that toddlers stay at home all the time, while adults spend only 62.5 % of their time and 6.7 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 , respectively. The 95 th percentile EDIs for toddlers and adults were 91 and 33 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 , respectively (Cao et al., 2019). The estimated EDIs for this study are comparable with those of 160 and 32 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 calculated for toddlers and adults respectively in Germany (Brommer et al., 2012).

        <p>Recently, a few studies have raised concerns about dermal absorption as a potentially significant pathway of exposure to OPEs (Abdallah et al., 2016;Mendelsohn et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017a, b;Bello et al., 2018;Frederiksen et al., 2018). Table S6 summarises estimates of dermal exposure to OPEs published to date. Hoffman et al. (2015) found a significant positive association between levels of TDCIPP and TPHP on hand wipes and the concentrations of their metabolites in urine, suggesting that hand-to-mouth contact and/or dermal absorption may be important exposure pathways to OPEs. More recently, a study examining the exposure to TPHP through nail polish application, suggested the primary exposure route of TPHP is dermal absorption (Mendelsohn et al., 2016). Similarly, in a study carried out by Bello et al. (2018), high levels of urinary biomarkers of TCIPP were detected post-shift in applicators of spray polyurethane foam (SPF) used as thermal insulating material in construction, indicating dermal absorption as an important exposure pathway to TCIPP to such individuals.Recently, a few studies have raised concerns about dermal absorption as a potentially significant pathway of exposure to OPEs (Abdallah et al., 2016;Mendelsohn et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017a, b;Bello et al., 2018;Frederiksen et al., 2018).

        <p>In addition, in vitro skin absorption studies (Abdallah et al., 2016;Hughes et al., 2001) reveal that a relatively high percentage of TCEP, TCIPP, and TDCIPP can be absorbed by human or mouse skin. Assessments of dermal exposure to OPEs are however, limited. Two studies reported OPE intakes via dermal absorption from contact with indoor dust (Cequier et al., 2014;Abdallah et al., 2016).

Abdallah et al. (2016) investigated human dermal uptake of OPEs using human ex vivo and cultured EPISKIN TM 3-D human skin equivalent (3D-HSE) models.</p>
        <p>They reported that the median EDIs via dermal absorption of OPEs (TCEP, TCIPP, and TDCIPP) for toddlers and adults via indoor dust ingestion were 36 ng.kg bw -1 . day -1 and 4.1 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 which were lower than the reported values of 108 ng.kg bw -1 . day -1 and 23 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 ( OPEs) for school children and women by Cequier et al. (2014). Abdallah et al. (2016) also investigated the impact of hand-washing on reducing dermal exposure to OPEs. They found that depending on the physicochemical properties of the OPEs, handwashing reduces the overall human dermal uptake of the OPEs (Abdallah et al., 2016). The same authors noted that as well as from adhered indoor dust, OPEs on the skin surface might also arise from dermal contact with flame-retarded consumer products (i.e. fabrics, mobile phones), which may constitute a more significant exposure route due to high concentrations of OPEs in these products (Abdallah et al, 2016(Abdallah et al, , 2018)). In summary, the evidence to date suggests that human exposure to selected individual OPEs via dermal absorption occurs in this order:They reported that the median EDIs via dermal absorption of OPEs (TCEP, TCIPP, and TDCIPP) for toddlers and adults via indoor dust ingestion were 36 ng.kg bw -1 . day -1 and 4.1 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 which were lower than the reported values of 108 ng.kg bw -1 . day -1 and 23 ng. kg bw -1 . day -1 ( OPEs) for school children and women by Cequier et al.

        <p>To date, several studies have reported concentrations of OPEs in source and finished water from municipal water plant (MWP), terminal tap water from water utilities, surface water from river (Liu et al., 2019;Benotti et al., 2009;Rodil et al., 2012), bottled, household tap and filtered water produced from tap water by public purifying machine/household filtering apparatus (Li et al., 2014;Ding et al., 2015;Lee et al., 2016;Kim and Kannan, 2018;Park et al., 2018). Reported concentrations of individual OPEs are shown in Table S7.

The average of the reported mean human exposure estimates for each of these eight OPEs via dust, water, human milk and food ingestion, air inhalation, and dermal absorption, were used to evaluate the relative significance of each exposure pathway for both toddlers and adults. These average EDI values for each exposure pathway considered for adults and toddlers are listed in Table 1 and their relative contributions to overall exposure to each individual OPE illustrated in Figure 8 for toddlers and Figure 9 for adults. b Oral cancer slope factor (SFO) values (USEPA, 2017; Li et al., 2018) This data analysis shows that for toddlers, dermal uptake of OPEs from indoor dust was the major exposure pathway for all the chlorinated OPEs i.e. TCEP (103 ng.kg bw -1 .day -1 , 93 %), TCIPP (208 ng.kg bw -1 .day -1 , 92 % exposure), and TDCIPP (221 ng.kg bw -1 .day -1 , 98 %); as well as for aryl OPEs such as TPHP (401 ng.kg bw -1 .day -1 , 98%) and EHDPP (227 ng.kg bw -1 .day -1 , 98 %). It should be noted here that this high contribution of dermal uptake from indoor dust for these OPEs is driven very substantially by the mean exposure estimates via this pathway reported in a single study of childcare centres in the USA (Stubbings et al, 2018). This illustrates that the estimates provided here are averages across a number of different studies conducted at different points in time and space.This section examines the significance of food ingestion in the context of its contribution to total human exposure to the following OPEs based on available literature data: TCEP, TCIPP, TDCIPP, TPHP, TnBP, TBOEP, TEHP, and EHDPP.

This comparison indicated that EDI values of the sum of all exposure pathways for toddlers and adults were lower than the established reference dose values for all OPEs considered in this review (USEPA, 2017;Li et al., 2018).The sum of the average EDIs via all exposure pathways for toddlers and adults for the eight OPEs evaluated were used to evaluate the risk of such overall exposure via comparison with the corresponding reference dose (RfD) values (Fig. 10 and Fig. 11).

        <p>We also considered carcinogenic effects arising from chronic daily exposure to OPEs for both adults and toddlers using published oral cancer slope factors (SFOs) (USEPA, 2017; Li et al., 2018). Carcinogenic risk estimates were obtained by multiplying the estimated daily intake (EDI) value for a given OPE by its SFO value, which are currently only available for TCEP, TnBP and TEHP (USEPA, 2017; Li et al., 2018). Our estimate of the total carcinogenic risk (TCR) via the sum of all exposure pathways for adults for all three of these OPEs (TCEP, TnBP and TEHP) were below the acceptable risk value of 1x10 -6 (Ding et al., 2015). However, while toddler exposures to TnBP and TEHP also fell below a TCR of 1x10 -6 ; for TCEP, the TCR 2.44x10 -6 for toddlers exceeded the acceptable risk value (Table 1). This suggests concern over the carcinogenic risk from TCEP for toddlers when considering the sum of the exposure pathways considered in this review. This study summed the average of the mean estimates of exposure to OPEs via a range of pathways and used these to derive estimates of the relative contributions of each pathway to overall exposure to individual OPEs for both adults and toddlers. For toddlers, dermal uptake from dust ingestion was highlighted as the predominant pathway of exposure to chlorinated OPEs, as well as EHDPP and TPHP. In contrast, diet was identified as the main pathway of exposure to all eight OPEs considered for adults, and for TnBP, TEHP, and TBOEP for toddlers. Reassuringly, these summed exposures were below the reference dose (RfD) values reported by the USEPA (2017). However, it is important to stress that our summed exposures do not include high-end exposure estimates and that for highly-exposed individuals, the margin Total Adults EDIs (All Exposure pathways) USEPA ( 2017) RfD values between exposure and the RfD values will be smaller. Moreover, assessment of total cancer risk raises concerns about exposure of toddlers to TCEP when exposure via all pathways is considered. A further caveat is that this review relied on a meta-analysis of mean exposure estimates from multiple exposure assessments conducted over a range of points in space and time, with concomitant uncertainty in both the magnitude and the relative contribution of different exposure pathways. Therefore, there is an urgent need for comprehensive assessments of human exposure to OPEs that examine all relevant pathways in a spatially and temporallyconsistent fashion.We also considered carcinogenic effects arising from chronic daily exposure to OPEs for both adults and toddlers using published oral cancer slope factors (SFOs) (USEPA, 2017; Li et al., 2018).

        <p>This review reveals that relatively few studies have determined the magnitude of human dietary exposure to OPEs. Given our finding that food is an important exposure pathway to these chemicals, regular monitoring of the presence of OPEs in foodstuffs is recommended.This review reveals that relatively few studies have determined the magnitude of human dietary exposure to OPEs.

        <p>Moreover, the currently available literature reveals that human dietary exposure to OPEs occurs principally via industrially processed food groups, such as grains, oils, and dairy products (Li et al., 2019;Poma et al., 2018). For this reason, surveillance of OPEs in processed foodstuff samples should likely have higher priority compared to raw foodstuffs in future studies. This is especially important for EHDPP, which is capable of migrating from packaging materials to the foodstuffs (Wang and Kannan, 2018;Poma et al., 2018;Li et al., 2019). Moreover, several studies have highlighted that OPE derivatives can be generated by enzyme-catalysed metabolism of OPEs in biota as well as through other degradation routes, such as microbial metabolism/biotransformation, base-catalysed hydrolysis, and photodegradation (Li et al., 2019;Cequier et al., 2015;Greaves et al., 2016). This suggests that OPE derivatives could potentially co-exist with parent OPEs in environmental samples or foodstuffs (Fu et al., 2017).Moreover, the currently available literature reveals that human dietary exposure to OPEs occurs principally via industrially processed food groups, such as grains, oils, and dairy products (Li et al., 2019;Poma et al., 2018).

        <p>More importantly, some studies have stated that compared to their parent OPE triesters, such metabolites/degradation products are more biologically active with respect to several toxicological endpoints (Li et al., 2019;Su et al., 2014). However, to date, there is to our knowledge only two published report on OPE derivatives/by-products in foodstuffs that reported the presence of OPEs metabolites in diet samples (Poma et al., 2019;He et al., 2018a).More importantly, some studies have stated that compared to their parent OPE triesters, such metabolites/degradation products are more biologically active with respect to several toxicological endpoints (Li et al., 2019;Su et al., 2014).

        <p>While dermal uptake from indoor dust is revealed as an important human exposure pathway, there appear to date to be no evaluations of exposure via dermal uptake from OPE-containing products such as foam-filled furniture. Given the widespread use of chlorinated OPEs at percent concentrations in furniture foam (Stubbings et al, 2018), investigation of this exposure pathway seems prudent. This review also highlights that there are very few data on OPEs in drinking water and more research is needed to ascertain the level and human exposure to these compounds through water ingestion.While dermal uptake from indoor dust is revealed as an important human exposure pathway, there appear to date to be no evaluations of exposure via dermal uptake from OPE-containing products such as foam-filled furniture.

        <p>OPEs enter the human diet primarily via two routes. First, via bioaccumulation into plants and animals from contaminated air, soil, water, animal diet etc. Second, foodstuffs can be contaminated by OPEs during production, industrial processing (e.g., packing, canning, and drying) and storage, due to their presence in several materials used in food processing as well as in food contact and packaging materials (Campone et al., 2010;Ding et al., 2018;Poma et al., 2018;Wang and Kannan, 2018). Moreover, cooking processes may reduce the levels of OPE contamination in food (Ding et al., 2018;Zhao et al., 2019). Table S11 summarises the concentrations of OPEs detected in foodstuffs to date.OPEs enter the human diet primarily via two routes.

        <p>In surveys of fish worldwide, concentrations of OPEs have been reported to be as high as 15,000 ng g -1 (lipid weight -lw) (Sundkvist et al., 2010) (Table S11). Rice was reported as a significant source of exposure to OPEs in China (Zhang et al., 2016). In the study of Poma et al. (2018), fish-oil food supplements were the most contaminated food samples with a total mean ƩOPE concentration of 225 ng.g -1 (wet weight -ww), followed by grain, cheese, and other food (meat and chicken stocks) with concentrations of 36.9, 20.1, and 18.8 ng.g -1 ww respectively (Table S11). These observed values exceeded those detected in duplicate diet samples by Xu et al. (2017) who found the sum of the average concentrations of four OPEs (EHDPP, TCEP, TPHP, and TCIPP) to be 7.7 ng.g -1 ww (Xu et al., 2017).
