        <p>Dementia is a pressing public health challenge. Its prevalence is strongly age-related: doubling every 5-6 years over the age of 65 years. The number of people living with dementia worldwide is estimated at 50 million and expected to reach 152 million by 2050. Its current economic cost worldwide is US$818 billion/year (as of 2015) and it will rise in proportion to the numbers affected (WHO, 2019).Dementia is a pressing public health challenge.

        <p>Interest in the possible effects of air pollutants on the brain began in about 2002 when Calderon-Garciduenas and colleagues reported that dogs exposed to air pollution in Mexico City showed neuropathological changes of the type associated with Alzheimer's disease (Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2002). This work was an extension of studies undertaken in the 1990s on the effects of Mexico City air pollution on the olfactory epithelium of humans and dogs. More recently, interest in possible effects on the brain has been strengthened by epidemiological studies, which suggest that exposure to air pollutants is associated with a decline of cognitive function and the development of dementia.Interest in the possible effects of air pollutants on the brain began in about 2002 when Calderon-Garciduenas and colleagues reported that dogs exposed to air pollution in Mexico City showed neuropathological changes of the type associated with Alzheimer's disease (Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2002).

        <p>Magnetite nanoparticles have been found in the brain with a morphology that suggests an exogenous origin (Maher et al., 2016). Similar ferrous nanoparticles were found in air collected at traffic roadsides in the UK (Sanderson et al., 2016). These nanoparticles may be able to reach the brain via the olfactory nerves and olfactory bulb (Oberdörster et al., 2009), or via the circumventricular organs where the blood-brain barrier is more permeable (Banks et al., 1995). In addition, the blood-brain barrier could be made less impermeable by systemic inflammation (Varatharaj and Galea, 2017) for which exposure to air pollutants is a known risk factor (Araujo, 2011). The blood-brain barrier is also more permeable in the very young and old, making these two life stages opportunities for the entry of nanoparticles into the brain, and potential elicitation of neurological damage.Magnetite nanoparticles have been found in the brain with a morphology that suggests an exogenous origin (Maher et al., 2016).

        <p>In addition to the possible direct effects from nanoparticles reaching the brain, there are indirect mechanisms by which pollutants could potentially lead to brain injury. These include damage to the vasculature, leading to cerebral ischaemia or extravasation of neurotoxic proteins such as fibrinogen. Brain injury could also be secondary to systemic inflammatory responses to air pollution (Brockmeyer and D'Angiulli, 2016;Campbell, 2004;Kicinski et al., 2015;Mumaw et al., 2016b;Wang et al., 2009).In addition to the possible direct effects from nanoparticles reaching the brain, there are indirect mechanisms by which pollutants could potentially lead to brain injury.

        <p>There is great interest in reducing risk of dementia by identifying preventable risk factors for the responsible diseases. Epidemiological evidence, linking exposure to air pollutants with adverse effects on cognition and the development of dementia, has expanded appreciably over the past 15 years. Several literature reviews were published between 2015 and 2019, including eight systematic reviews on the association between ambient air pollution exposure and cognitive function, cognitive decline and dementia (Clifford et al., 2016;Dimakakou et al., 2018;Fu et al., 2019;Killin et al., 2016;Peters et al., 2019;Peters et al., 2015;Power et al., 2016;Zhao et al., 2018). Some of the reviews included studies of several aspects of cognitive performance and cognitive decline (Attilio et al., 2018;Bejot et al., 2011;Cipriani et al., 2018;Cohen and Gerber, 2017;Costa et al., 2014;Kilian and Kitazawa, 2018;Xu et al., 2016). Others also included evidence from neuroimagining studies (Babadjouni et al., 2017;Dimakakou et al., 2018;Paul et al., 2019;Power et al., 2016;Russ, 2018). Some reviews have focused solely on cognitive function (Clifford et al., 2016;Tzivian et al., 2015b), neuroimaging data (de Prado Bert et al., 2018), dementia (Killin et al., 2016;Peters et al., 2019) or a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Yegambaram et al., 2015). A few reviews have focused on specific air pollutants, such as ozone (O 3 ) (Zhao et al., 2018) or fine particulate matter (Fu et al., 2019). Only one of the review papers analysed the available evidence on cognitive performance with reference to the Bradford Hill features of causality (Clifford et al., 2016) and that review covered 13 studies prior to October 2015.There is great interest in reducing risk of dementia by identifying preventable risk factors for the responsible diseases.

        <p>The current review covers epidemiological studies up to December 2019, and concerns the relationship between air pollution and multiple measures of cognitive performance and neurodegeneration, including global cognitive function and performance in specific cognitive domains (attention, executive function, memory, etc.); cognitive decline, mild and incident cognitive impairment; dementia, hospitalizations related to dementia; brain imagining and neurological biomarkers. This review critically analyses the literature following the guidance of Bradford Hill (Hill, 1965) on the features of causal associations. In addition, this review considers the various confounding factors as well as the evidence on effect modifiers.The current review covers epidemiological studies up to December 2019, and concerns the relationship between air pollution and multiple measures of cognitive performance and neurodegeneration, including global cognitive function and performance in specific cognitive domains (attention, executive function, memory, etc.); cognitive decline, mild and incident cognitive impairment; dementia, hospitalizations related to dementia; brain imagining and neurological biomarkers.

        <p>The studies used several different methods to estimate chronic exposure to air pollution, such as proximity models (e.g. distance to nearest road), allocating concentrations from the nearest monitoring site, using geostatistical models (e.g. krigging, inverse distance weighting), dispersion models, land use regression models and hybrid models (e.g. incorporating satellite measures, chemical transport models, Bayesian models). Studies assessing effects of short-term exposure to air pollution on hospital admissions estimated daily exposures by using district or regional level mean concentrations obtained from available monitoring stations within the region of interest.The studies used several different methods to estimate chronic exposure to air pollution, such as proximity models (e.g. distance to nearest road), allocating concentrations from the nearest monitoring site, using geostatistical models (e.g. krigging, inverse distance weighting), dispersion models, land use regression models and hybrid models (e.g. incorporating satellite measures, chemical transport models, Bayesian models).

        <p>The effect of air pollution on global cognitiondefined as a cognitive decline assessed using tests such as Mini-Mental State Examination 1 Neuropsychological tests are specific tasks defined to assess a brain function known to (MMSE) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Total Scorehas been evaluated on the basis of the evidence from sixteen papers (see Table S1). Sanchez-Rodriguez et al. (2006) found that older residents in Mexico DC (aged &gt;60) had significantly lower global cognition, measured by MMSE, compared with residents in rural areas (MMSE: 26.15 ± 0.35 vs 27.16 ± 0.28, p &lt; 0.05) (Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2006). No formal assessment of air pollution was made, only a simple urban-rural comparison. Sun and Gu (2008) studied the association between air pollution and cognitive performance among participants of the Chinese Longitudinal Health Survey. They used the Air Pollution Index (API), which is a composite index encompassing sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter of &lt;10 μm in diameter (PM 10 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone concentrations. After adjusting for several meteorological, demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and health factors, they reported that a 1-point increase in the API (in 1995) at the city level was associated with a significant mean difference of 1.51 points in the MMSE test (as measured in 2002) indicating poorer cognitive function in older adults (86.3 ± 11.4 years) (Sun and Gu, 2008). Ranft et al. (2009) studied the effect of air pollution on cognitive function and attention in elderly women in the SALIA cohort in the Ruhr valley, Germany, and accounted for demographic, lifestyle, health and education variables. They found that living within 50 m of a busy road (&gt;10,000 cars/day) during the 20 years prior to the test was related to poorer performance on the CERAD test (β = -3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.8, 0.1). The association with average PM 10 for the period when the tests were undertaken (2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) was weaker (β = -0.6, 95% CI -1.4, 0.2) and was reversed when PM 10 exposures estimated for the age when tests were conducted (55 years) were used (β = 0.4, 95% CI 0.0, 0.9) (Ranft et al., 2009). In both cases, exposures were assigned using 5-year average concentrations measured at the nearest monitoring site. A follow up study on the SALIA cohort estimated exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), nitrogen oxide (NO x ), particulate matter of &lt;2.5 μm in diameter (PM 2.5 ) and PM 10 using a land use regression model (LUR) (Schikowski et al., 2015). A statistically significant association was found between increased NOx exposure and lower cognitive performance on CERAD testing (β = -1.35, 95% CI -2.59, -0.10) but not MMSE (β = -0.04, 95% CI -0.19, 0.12). No associations were found between traffic load, NO 2 , PM 10 or PM 2.5 , and CERAD and or MMSE test scores. Wellenius et al. (2012) found that participants in the MOBILIZE Boston study who were ≤77 years or who were college-educated, and who lived near busy traffic roadsides, had an increased risk of lower cognitive performance (MMSE &lt;26). Odds ratios (OR) of 1.34 (95% CI 1.01,1.76) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.10, 2.17) respectively, were reported as being associated with an interquartile range (IQR) decrease (851.2 m) in residential distance to a major road. They also studied the association with black carbon (BC), a diesel tracer, in the same population. An IQR increase in residential BC (0.11 μg/m 3 ) estimated using a LUR model was positively, but statistically not significantly, associated with an increased risk of lower cognitive performance (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.99, 1.34). Power et al. (2011) reported that exposure to BC increased the odds of having a MMSE score of ≤25 by a factor of 1.3 (95% CI 1.1;1.6) for each doubling of BC concentration and this was equivalent to aging by 1.9 years. Colicino and colleagues found the association between BC and cognitive function to be affected by telomere length, systemic inflammation (Colicino et al., 2017) and microRNA (miRNA) expression in carriers of particular miRNA-processing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Colicino et al., 2016). Gatto et al. (2014) studied the effects of O 3, NO 2, and PM 2.5 among healthy, mainly Caucasian, women aged 60 ± 8 years living in Los Angeles, USA. No association was found between pollutant exposures and lower global cognition (Gatto et al., 2014).The effect of air pollution on global cognitiondefined as a cognitive decline assessed using tests such as Mini-Mental State Examination 1 Neuropsychological tests are specific tasks defined to assess a brain function known to (MMSE) and the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Total Scorehas been evaluated on the basis of the evidence from sixteen papers (see Table S1).

        <p>A significant inverse association was found between PM 2.5 exposure and cognitive function for the highest (13.8-20.7 μg/m 3 ) vs the lowest (4.5-9.9 μg/m 3 ) category of exposure (β = -0.26, 95% CI -0.47; -0.05) in adults &gt;50 years participating in the nationwide Health and Retirement Study in the US (Ailshire and Crimmins, 2014). Similar results were observed in the American's Changing Life's Survey, with a higher number of cognitive errors associated with PM 2.5 exposure (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.08 per 1 μg/m 3 of PM 2.5 ) (Ailshire et al., 2017). The Heinz Nixdorf Recall cohort study in Germany found an association between an IQR increase of PM 2.5 (1.43 μg/m 3 ) and worse global cognition, but this was statistically significant only in those subjects exposed to high noise levels (β = -0.48, 95% CI -0.72, -0.23) (Tzivian et al., 2017).A significant inverse association was found between PM 2.5 exposure and cognitive function for the highest (13.8-20.7 μg/m 3 ) vs the lowest (4.5-9.9 μg/m 3 ) category of exposure (β = -0.26, 95% CI -0.47; -0.05) in adults &gt;50 years participating in the nationwide Health and Retirement Study in the US (Ailshire and Crimmins, 2014).

        <p>A significant positive association was found between residential proximity to traffic (&lt;50 m) and risk of incident dementia (ascertained from provincial health administrative databases with validated algorithms) in the Ontario Population Health and Environment Cohort of over 2 million participants in Toronto, Canada (HR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06; 1.08), with a significant trend in risk. The strongest associations were found for residents of the main cities in Ontario (Canada) and for urban residents (H. Chen et al., 2017a). A follow-up analysis of the same cohort found PM 2.5 to be significantly associated with dementia incidence, with a HR of 1.04 (95% CI, 1.03-1.05) for every IQR (3.4 μg/ m3) increase in exposure to PM 2.5 . NO 2 (per IQR increase of 11.3 ppb) was also associated with increased incidence of dementia (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.08-1.12).

        <p>Bradford Hill pointed out that it was more likely that strong than weak associations were causal in nature: if the former were caused by confounding factors linked to the putative causal agent, those factors should not be difficult to identify, whereas for weak associations possible confounding factors might be difficult to identify. In general, associations between air pollutants and effects on health tend to be weak rather than strong, and it is clear that the question of causality cannot be decided on the basis of strength of association alone. Weak associations might be causal in nature; the weakness or strength of an association does not of itself control the likelihood of causality. In addition, it should be noted that weak, but causal, associations might be very important in terms of their implications for public health if a large proportion of the population is exposed.Bradford Hill pointed out that it was more likely that strong than weak associations were causal in nature: if the former were caused by confounding factors linked to the putative causal agent, those factors should not be difficult to identify, whereas for weak associations possible confounding factors might be difficult to identify.

        <p>The reviewed literature suggests that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with a small to modest reduction in global cognitive performance, attention, memory, and language function, and with concomitant morphological changes in the brain (Chen and Schwartz, 2009;Power et al., 2011;Wellenius et al., 2012;Weuve et al., 2012;Wilker et al., 2015), as summarized in Table 1. The effects on cognitive function are similar to those of aging 1 to 5 years.The reviewed literature suggests that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with a small to modest reduction in global cognitive performance, attention, memory, and language function, and with concomitant morphological changes in the brain (Chen and Schwartz, 2009;Power et al., 2011;Wellenius et al., 2012;Weuve et al., 2012;Wilker et al., 2015), as summarized in Table 1.

        <p>As described in Section 3.2, the reported associations between indices of air pollution and endpoints indicating effects on the brain are, in general, weak. They are, however, not notably weaker than other associations in the air pollution field, and the potential risks are considerable, as highlighted by a recent cohort study in London: subjects in the upper quartile of NO 2 exposure (&gt;41.5 μg/m 3 ) were at a 40% greater risk of dementia (95% CI 1.12-1.74) compared to those in the lowest quartile (&lt;31.9 μg/m 3 ) (Carey et al., 2018). Overall, there is evidence for weak associations, and some high-quality studies reporting strong associations of substantial potential public health importance.As described in Section 3.2, the reported associations between indices of air pollution and endpoints indicating effects on the brain are, in general, weak.

For instance, in the USA gasoline emissions dominate urban air pollution. In Europe, diesel vehicle emissions make a larger contribution. The temporal profiles of air pollutant mixtures also vary. The enforcement of stricter fuel regulations (e.g. reduced sulfur content, unleaded gasoline) and technological advances in transport (e.g. improved fuel combustion) and industry (e.g. improved control of stack emissions) has resulted in considerable reduction in air pollutant emissions in recent years. In comparing different studies, the geographical and temporal patterns of air pollutants also need to be considered.Moreover, studies have been conducted in a wide range of geographical locations, each with a different mixture of air pollutants.

        <p>Proximity to traffic (3 of 3) and CO (2 of 2) has consistently been associated with increased risk of dementia. NO 2 /NO x (7 of 8) and PM (6 of 9) have also been associated with dementia in most studies, but O 3 in only 2 of 5 studies. One large study (on approximately 9 million people) found that long-term exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with first-time hospital admissions for Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia (Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2016). This is consistent with population-basedstudies showing associations between short-term variations in air pollution and neurological disease-related hospital admissions in Madrid (Spain) (Culqui et al., 2017;Linares et al., 2017), Chengdu (China) (Qiu et al., 2019) and USA (in older adults) (Zanobetti et al., 2014). However, a study in Rome did not find consistent associations between air pollutants and first-time hospitalization for dementia (Cerza et al., 2019).

        <p>Evidence of changes on neuroimaging in association with air pollution is more limited and less consistent. Studies on the WHIMS cohort have found associations between air pollution and reductions in white matter volume (Casanova et al., 2016;J.C. Chen et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2015). In three different US cohorts air pollution has not been associated with hippocampal volume (Casanova et al., 2016;J.C. Chen et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2015;Wilker et al., 2015), but left hippocampal volume was associated with air pollution in the UK Biobank cohort (Hedges et al., 2019). Exposure to particulate matter was associated with lower gray matter volume in the WHIMS and ARIC cohorts (Casanova et al., 2016;J.C. Chen et al., 2017;Power et al., 2018) and, in the WHISCA and WHIMS-MRI cohorts, with a pattern of atrophy of gray matter structures similar to that in Alzheimer's disease (Younan et al., 2020). Documented effects of exposure to air pollution on neuroimaging features of small vessel disease are inconsistent (J.C.

        <p>Although most of the reviewed studies have found significant associations between concentrations of at least one air pollutant and markers of brain injury, and some have reported associations that suggest a deleterious effect but failed to reach statistical significance, a few studies have found contrary associations: proximity to traffic associated with a lower risk of white matter hyperintensities (Wilker et al., 2016;Wilker et al., 2015), better reasoning and prospective memory (Cullen et al., 2018), better verbal memory and visuospatial skills (Wurth et al., 2018), reduced risk of first time hospitalization related to dementia (Cerza et al., 2019), better scores on tests of global cognition, executive function, attention and memory (Shin et al., 2019), reduced cognitive decline (Xu et al., 2017), and a non-significant association between air pollution and improved cognitive performance (Tonne et al., 2014).Although most of the reviewed studies have found significant associations between concentrations of at least one air pollutant and markers of brain injury, and some have reported associations that suggest a deleterious effect but failed to reach statistical significance, a few studies have found contrary associations: proximity to traffic associated with a lower risk of white matter hyperintensities (Wilker et al., 2016;Wilker et al., 2015), better reasoning and prospective memory (Cullen et al., 2018), better verbal memory and visuospatial skills (Wurth et al., 2018), reduced risk of first time hospitalization related to dementia (Cerza et al., 2019), better scores on tests of global cognition, executive function, attention and memory (Shin et al., 2019), reduced cognitive decline (Xu et al., 2017), and a non-significant association between air pollution and improved cognitive performance (Tonne et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>Although the various studies have examined the effects of a range of different pollutants, there is some correlation between different pollutants, especially in urban areas. It seems, therefore, reasonable to compare studies on different pollutants to gauge overall consistency. Our review has shown that there is reasonably strong consistency across the range of studies reported: stronger in the studies linking air pollution to incident dementia, and weaker in others (e.g. relating to executive function, mild cognitive impairment). There is only moderate consistency between the documented effects of different air pollutants on cognition and on brain structure and neuropathology.Although the various studies have examined the effects of a range of different pollutants, there is some correlation between different pollutants, especially in urban areas.

        <p>The failure to detect an association between air pollution and cognitive performance, cognitive decline or dementia in some studies could be due to the fact that such an association does not exist. It could also be a consequence of using too crude a model to estimate exposure, e.g. relying on the nearest monitor (Chen and Schwartz, 2009;Gatto et al., 2014;Ranft et al., 2009), or using models with a coarse (10 km by 10 km) grid structure to estimate exposure (Loop et al., 2015). The lack of an association could be because the environmental concentrations in the particular study were too low to cause an observable effect as suggested by Oudin et al. (2017). It might also be due to not appropriately accounting for confounding/effect-modifying factors. For instance, Oudin et al. (2016) found a statistically significant effect only when the analysis took into account the age of participants. Likewise, Tonne et al. (2014) found statistically significant associations between exposure and cognitive decline only in subjects who had never moved from London, which authors suggested to be a consequence of reduced exposure misclassification. A lack of association might also be related to the misalignment between etiologic exposure windows and the measured/modelled exposure windows.

        <p>All the reviewed papers considered air pollution as the putative cause. Many of them included variables related to traffic-associated air pollution, such as distance to the nearest busy road, or level of black carbon (a tracer of diesel exhaust). Some focused on particulate matter, for which traffic is a major source, although other sources (e.g. resuspension, secondary formation in the atmosphere) exist. A few studies focused on the effect of gaseous air pollutants, such as NO 2 /NO x and ozone, for which traffic is an important primary and secondary source respectively. Some of the studies that reported comparative associations with PM, NO 2 or O 3 exposures, or that compared effects of PM with those of traffic distance, showed a larger effect for the gases or traffic measure than for PM. For instance, Schikowski et al. (2015) reported a stronger association with NO 2 than PM 10 for constructional praxis; Chen and Schwartz (2009) reported a larger effect for O 3 than for PM 10 on learning recall and short-term memory; Wellenius et al. (2012) found a stronger effect on immediate recall for exposure to traffic than exposures to BC. However, there were studies that showed a larger effect for PM than for other air pollutants. For instance, Tzivian et al. (2016) reported a larger effect for PM 2.5 than for NO 2 on amnestic MCI; and Gatto et al. (2014) ranked responses: PM 2.5 &gt; O 3 &gt; NO 2 for verbal learning. For dementia, some studies found a larger effect for PM 2.5 than for gases (e.g. H.

        <p>Bradford Hill (1965) acknowledged that one-to-one relationships are infrequent and that several causes might have the same effect. This is indeed the case here, where several putative causes (air pollutants) and, also, confounding factors (described in detail below) might affect cognitive decline. Conversely, one agent, i.e. air pollution, might influence a variety of health outcomes, including different types of cancer, cardio-respiratory diseases, reproduction, cardio-metabolic disease and mortality (Dehbi et al., 2017;Gowers et al., 2012;Pope and Dockery, 2006;Pope et al., 2015;Samoli et al., 2016;Sram et al., 2005). A familiar example is smoking, which is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes. Hence, Bradford Hill (1965) emphasized the importance of identifying an underlying factor linking cause and effect (e.g. a specific biological mechanism linking exposure to air pollution with cognitive decline or dementia).Bradford Hill (1965) acknowledged that one-to-one relationships are infrequent and that several causes might have the same effect.

        <p>Almost all reviewed studies have focused on the possible effects of chronic exposure to air pollutants. Such studies imply a sustained exposure to air pollutants prior to the discovery of effects and thus support a temporal relationship between exposure and effect. Only a few studies had a longitudinal design, with measurement of cognitive indices at baseline and follow-up, and exposure to air pollutants estimated from the subjects' residential addresses. Most of the reviewed studies made the assumption that differences between recently measured exposures (or pollutant concentrations) closely reflect those in the past. Other studies estimated long-term exposure to air pollutants. The current section analyses temporality, focussing particularly on results from classical longitudinal studies.Almost all reviewed studies have focused on the possible effects of chronic exposure to air pollutants.

        <p>The longitudinal studies that have estimated exposures over long periods of time have demonstrated significantly faster decline in cognition in participants with higher pollution exposures (Cleary et al., 2018;Lo et al., 2019;Tonne et al., 2014;Weuve et al., 2012;Wurth et al., 2018). The findings are supported by cross-sectional studies, showing that subjects exposed to the highest levels of (estimated) long-term air pollution performed worst in cognitive tests (Power et al., 2011;Ranft et al., 2009;Zeng et al., 2010) and had the highest hazard ratio for incident dementia (H.

        <p>On the other hand, a longitudinal analysis in the Betula study in Northern Sweden did not find any association between long-term exposure to ambient NO x and change in episodic memory, a marker of early cognitive decline. The authors suggested that the lack of an effect could be related to the low NO x exposures of participants (estimated from outdoor exposure models), to other exposures such as domestic wood burning (an indoor source contributing to NO 2 exposure) not captured in their exposure model or to attrition in cognitively compromised participants (Oudin et al., 2017). Two follow-up analyses on participants in the Betula Study found that PM 2.5 from local residential wood burning and from traffic sources was associated with dementia incidence (Oudin et al., 2018), and that NO 2 from traffic was linked to a higher risk of developing dementia (Andersson et al., 2018).On the other hand, a longitudinal analysis in the Betula study in Northern Sweden did not find any association between long-term exposure to ambient NO x and change in episodic memory, a marker of early cognitive decline.

        <p>The work investigating the mechanisms by which air pollutants might damage the brain began with a focus on ozone and has evolved to include ambient particles and, especially, metal-rich particles. Interest has focused on the initiation of an inflammatory response in the brain (Block and Calderon-Garciduenas, 2009;Gonzalez-Guevara et al., 2014;Heusinkveld et al., 2016;Levesque et al., 2011a;Levesque et al., 2011b) and the role of oxidative stress (Cole et al., 2016;Farfán-García et al., 2014;Guerra et al., 2013;Heusinkveld et al., 2016;Kalita et al., 2018;M'Rad et al., 2018;Rodríguez-Martínez et al., 2013). Both biological mechanisms have been implicated in neurodegenerative conditions such as cognitive decline and dementia (Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2011;Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2004;Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2008). It is not clear whether the effects of pollutants are locally generated (i.e. resulting from a pollutant or reaction by-product which has entered the brain), or are secondary to adverse effects on the lung or in the systemic circulation. Nor is it clear whether the oxidative stress is the cause or the result of the neuroinflammation.The work investigating the mechanisms by which air pollutants might damage the brain began with a focus on ozone and has evolved to include ambient particles and, especially, metal-rich particles.

        <p>Air pollution has also been reported to be associated with accumulation of Aβ42 and other misfolded protein aggregates (Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2012;MohanKumar et al., 2008), changes in the blood-brain barrier (Block and Calderon-Garciduenas, 2009;Liu et al., 2017), and white matter lesions (Calderon-Garciduenas et al., 2012;Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2015;Guxens and Sunyer, 2012) reflecting small vessel disease. The cerebrovascular changes are in keeping with a large body of evidence indicating that air pollution increases the risk of ischaemic cardiac and cerebral vascular disease (COMEAP, 2018). It is possible that age may affect the susceptibility to the effects of air pollutants on the brain (Mumaw et al., 2016a;Rivas-Arancibia et al., 2000;Woodward et al., 2017).

        <p>The reviewed studies provide coherent evidence that chronic exposure to air pollution has a deleterious impact across a range of interrelated outcome measures: cognitive performance, cognitive decline, memory, attention, constructional praxis, morphological changes in the brain (most notably white matter atrophy), alterations of neurological biomarkers, as well as incidence of dementia, aggravation of symptoms of dementia, and hospitalizations related to dementia. The consistency with which air pollution has been associated with adverse effects across a wide range of endpoints indicates a considerable level of coherence between the findings of the reported studies.The reviewed studies provide coherent evidence that chronic exposure to air pollution has a deleterious impact across a range of interrelated outcome measures: cognitive performance, cognitive decline, memory, attention, constructional praxis, morphological changes in the brain (most notably white matter atrophy), alterations of neurological biomarkers, as well as incidence of dementia, aggravation of symptoms of dementia, and hospitalizations related to dementia.

        <p>Before discussing reversibility, it is important to consider this concept in the context of cognitive decline and dementia, as many of the potential underlying pathological alterations (e.g. formation of neurofibrillary tangles, degeneration of neurons, infarction of brain tissue) are unlikely themselves to be reversible. In the present discussion, reversibility refers to changing the slope of the biological gradient. For example, moving to a less polluted area might slow the rate of cognitive decline, reduce the incidence of dementia or increase the age of onset. This is a field of study that merits further research, as there is a paucity of evidence of the effect on cognitive trajectories of changing individual exposure to air pollution. Quasi-experimental designs where reversibility might be assessed include natural experiments that take account of policy changes aimed at mitigating air pollution (e.g. London Emission Zone, Dublin coal ban), in addition to carefully designed migration studies. Animal studies on reversibility of behavioural, imaging, biochemical or neuropathological markers of cognitive impairment would be complementary.Before discussing reversibility, it is important to consider this concept in the context of cognitive decline and dementia, as many of the potential underlying pathological alterations (e.g. formation of neurofibrillary tangles, degeneration of neurons, infarction of brain tissue) are unlikely themselves to be reversible.

        <p>Although the mixtures of toxicologically active species are not identical, smoking can be considered as a high-dose parallel of the effects of ambient air pollutants on cognitive decline and dementia. The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (as diagnosed clinically) was found to be significantly higher in active than former smokers (Durazzo et al., 2014;Ott et al., 1998;Peters et al., 2008). The risk of developing dementia and cognitive decline tended also to be greater in smokers than non-smokers or never-smokers, although this association did not reach significance (Peters et al., 2008). Overall, the comparative risk of dementia associated with smoking -a high-dose parallel of ambient air pollutants -suggests that, once the source of toxic exposure is removed, the speed of cognitive decline or dementia progression slows, and there is evidence that white matter damage associated with smoking declines on cessation of smoking (Gons et al., 2011). If this were true for air pollution, it would have important consequences for public health policies, as reductions on air pollution exposure would be expected to reduce the rate of cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia.Although the mixtures of toxicologically active species are not identical, smoking can be considered as a high-dose parallel of the effects of ambient air pollutants on cognitive decline and dementia.

        <p>Identifying and controlling/adjusting for confounding factors in the assessment of the effects of air pollution on cognitive decline and dementia is difficult as there is much that we still do not know about factors that affect cognition and cerebrovascular health. For instance, a recent paper reported an association between air pollution and depression and anxiety (Roberts et al., 2019); yet depression (Onwby et al., 2006) and anxiety (Wilson et al., 2011) have also been identified as potential risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Hence further research is required to understand whether depression and anxiety act as confounders or mediators of an association between air pollution and dementia.Identifying and controlling/adjusting for confounding factors in the assessment of the effects of air pollution on cognitive decline and dementia is difficult as there is much that we still do not know about factors that affect cognition and cerebrovascular health.

        <p>Factors that should be considered in the analysis of the effects of air pollution on cognitive decline and dementia include age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, ethnic background, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, co-morbidities -such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and mental health -and sleep deprivation. Other factors related to exposures should include exposure to noise, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), indoor sources (e.g. indoor biomass/wood burning), neurotoxicants (e.g. lead, mercury, pesticides, persistent organic pollutants) from dermal and/or dietary exposure routes.Factors that should be considered in the analysis of the effects of air pollution on cognitive decline and dementia include age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, ethnic background, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, co-morbidities -such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and mental health -and sleep deprivation.

Adjustments for other possible confounding factors were made in some studies, but this has been highly variable (Killin et al., 2016).

Individuallevel adjustment would be expected to enhance accuracy and reduce bias. However, Goodman et al. (2011) concluded that limited residual socio-economic confounding existed in epidemiological studies that included comprehensive area-level adjustment. However, this cannot be extrapolated to other potential confounders, such as smoking, drinking or pre-existence of comorbidities, where area-level indicators might not be adequate.Studies have adjusted for individual-level factors when available.

        <p>It is possible that the neurocognitive responses considered in the studies reviewed here may not be caused by exposure to air pollution. Instead, they may reflect effects on cognition of other factors acting at different ages (Clifford et al., 2016). This section describes several putative causes and confounding factors that should be considered when investigating the association between exposure to air pollution and cognitive impairment. For a high probability of causality to be inferred, the Bradford Hill characteristics of causal associations should be established in the absence of confounding, or after controlling for any confounding factor that could not be removed in the studies reviewed.It is possible that the neurocognitive responses considered in the studies reviewed here may not be caused by exposure to air pollution.

        <p>Environmental factors other than air pollutants of current interest could also contribute to associations between air pollution and cognitive decline. Past chronic exposure to lead, e.g. from leaded gasoline, could confound the observed associations, since lead exposure is associated with poor cognitive functioning (Bakulski et al., 2012). In addition, lead exposure could still play a part as it is a minor constituent of air pollution from sources such as tyre wear and incinerators (Sanderson et al., 2014). Power et al. (2011) adjusted for past lead exposure and did not report significant changes in their results. Other environmental neurotoxicants, such as mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides and ionizing radiation could also play a part or act as confounding factors (Xu et al., 2016). Whilst multiplicative and additive effects of these neurotoxicants with air pollution are possible, none of the reviewed studies has examined such an interaction (Xu et al., 2016).Environmental factors other than air pollutants of current interest could also contribute to associations between air pollution and cognitive decline.

        <p>Smoking and, in non-smokers, ETS has been associated with cognitive impairment (Llewellyn et al., 2009) and increased risk of dementia (Chen, 2012;Ott et al., 2004).

        <p>The association between air pollution and Body Mass Index (BMI) is still unclear. BMI has been associated with lower cognitive ability (Dahl et al., 2010;Kerwin et al., 2010) and more rapid cognitive decline in later life (Dahl et al., 2010), and with global reduction and regional alterations in gray matter volume in healthy adults (Taki et al., 2008). In contrast, Deschamps et al. reported that elderly subjects with a BMI &gt;23 had a lower risk of cognitive decline than did those with a BMI &lt;23 (Deschamps et al., 2002). Traffic pollution was associated with increased BMI in children in a Southern California cohort (Jerrett et al., 2014), and with obesity, higher fat content and larger BMI in adults participating in The Framingham Heart Study (Li et al., 2016). Further studies are required to disentangle whether BMI is mediating the association between exposure to air pollution and cognitive decline, or is a confounder.The association between air pollution and Body Mass Index (BMI) is still unclear.

        <p>Noise has been suggested as an environmental factor affecting cognitive performance. A study of police officers and office workers showed an effect of noise on arithmetic performance and logical reasoning, as well as on attention (Chiovenda et al., 2007), but authors did not investigate the possible interaction between air pollution and noise. Recent studies conducted in the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study found that noise acts synergistically with air pollution on global cognition and MCI (Tzivian et al., 2017). Air pollution had negative effects on general cognition irrespective of the noise level but the effect was more pronounced at higher noise levels. Noise showed a detrimental effect in relation to cognitive performance in single-agent models, but in twopollutant models the negative effect remained only when higher concentrations of pollution were considered (Tzivian et al., 2017). Similar results were found when the effects of air pollution and noise on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were investigated. Associations between PM 2.5 and MCI were stronger in participants with high noise exposure, whilst the effect of noise was enhanced in those subjects exposed to higher PM 2.5 concentrations (Tzivian et al., 2016). Carey et al. (2018) found in a London study that the effect of noise on incidence of dementia was no longer statistically significant when adjusted for PM 2.5 or NO 2 . Likewise, no association was found between road traffic noise and risk of developing dementia in the Betula study: the effect of NO 2 was not modified by adjusting for noise, nor was significant interaction found between noise and NO 2 on dementia risk (Andersson et al., 2018). Short-term noise exposures have been associated with increased daily dementia-related hospital admissions (Linares et al., 2017). Few of the epidemiological studies reviewed adjusted for noise levels.Noise has been suggested as an environmental factor affecting cognitive performance. A study of police officers and office workers showed an effect of noise on arithmetic performance and logical reasoning, as well as on attention (Chiovenda et al., 2007), but authors did not investigate the possible interaction between air pollution and noise.

        <p>Reduced exposure to green spaces could also be a confounding factor. However, evidence of the effect of "greenness" on cognition is limited. Studies in children suggest that "lifelong residential greenness" is associated with increased attention and reduced reaction time (Dadvand et al., 2017), with greater progress in the development of working memory over a calendar year (Dadvand et al., 2015) and with higher cerebral gray and white matter volumes in regions associated with better working memory and reduced inattentiveness (Dadvand et al., 2018). Controlled laboratory studies of adults have indicated that access to green spaces may buffer stress and facilitate cognitive restoration after mental fatigue (Berto, 2005;Mantler and Logan, 2015).Reduced exposure to green spaces could also be a confounding factor.

        <p>Socioeconomic factors could also play a role. Several potential individual-level and area-level socioeconomic factors could affect the relationship between air pollution exposure and cognitive and neurodegenerative health outcomes. Deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to experience high levels of air pollution (Xu et al., 2016) and lower educational attainment, the latter being associated with an increased risk of dementia later in life (Stern, 2012). Power et al. (2016) suggested that socio-cultural background may affect the associations between air pollution and cognitive performance, whereas cognitive decline was less susceptible to socio-cultural background factors. Socioeconomic factors were also suggested to explain Xu et al.'s (2017) results of more rapid cognitive decline in residents of rural than urban areas, a finding at odds with the broad conclusions of the reviewed literature. The authors suggested that this effect might have been related to poor access to socioeconomic benefits, such as health care and retirement pensions, for subjects living in rural areas (Xu et al., 2017).Socioeconomic factors could also play a role.

        <p>Sex has been identified as a confounder in a study which showed a stronger association in women than men between PM 2.5 exposure and cognitive disability in low and middle-income countries, although this finding could also have related to inadequately controlling for differences in indoor air exposure to pollutants (Lin et al., 2017). Poor early cognitive development is another possible confounder. People with lower cognitive development are likely to have poorer occupational prospects and lower socioeconomic status, and may be more exposed to pollution and subject to other risk factors for dementia (e.g. smoking) later in life.Sex has been identified as a confounder in a study which showed a stronger association in women than men between PM 2.5 exposure and cognitive disability in low and middle-income countries, although this finding could also have related to inadequately controlling for differences in indoor air exposure to pollutants (Lin et al., 2017).

        <p>Several of the reported studies excluded individuals with history of stroke or chronic disease. On the other hand, such exclusion may have affected the results by over-controlling for mediating factors (Clifford et al., 2016). Some studies which included adjustment for factors related to cardiovascular disease have shown an attenuation of pollution effect (Chen and Schwartz, 2009;Loop et al., 2013), suggesting that cardiovascular health could be contributory factor to the effect of air pollution on cognitive performance (Tzivian et al., 2015a).Several of the reported studies excluded individuals with history of stroke or chronic disease.

        <p>miRNAs are involved in neuroplasticity, neurodevelopment, synapse formation and maturation, and stress responses (Sharma and Lu, 2018).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in miRNA-processing genes were reported to affect the association between BC exposure and global cognition and MMSE scores (Colicino et al., 2016). The association between BC and MMSE was stronger in heterozygous carriers of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs11077 in gene XPO5 (OR = 1.99; 95% CI 1.39-2.85; pvalue interaction = 0.01, False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 0.09) and minor variant carriers of polymorphism rs2740348 in gene GEMIN4 (OR = 1.34; 95% CI 1.05-1.7; p-value interaction = 0.01, FDR = 0.13).

        <p>Pre-existent medical conditions have been suggested as effect modifiers, although results are inconclusive. Subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM) or who had suffered a stroke had lower hazard ratios for dementia in association with PM 2.5 exposure in a study in Canada (p-value interac- tion = 0.003 and 0.030, respectively) (H. Chen et al., 2017a). The authors suggested that the additive effect from pollution might have been masked by the heightened baseline risk profile of patients with these comorbidities (H. Chen et al., 2017a). A recent London-based study found higher (and statistically significant) adjusted hazard ratios for incidence of dementia due to exposure to NO 2 in subjects without comorbidities (i.e. IHD, stroke, DM or heart failure), although the interaction with comorbidities was non-significant (p-value interaction = 0.31) (Carey et al., 2018). The associations between exposure to PM 2.5 and diesel PM with white matter or gray matter volumes, mild cognitive impairment or dementia were not significantly modified by existing cardiovascular disease or DM, with the exception of diesel PM and gray matter parietal volumes, which varied with DM (p-value interaction = 0.03) (J.C. Chen et al., 2017). Tallon et al. (2017) did not find any influence of DM or hypertension on the association between air pollution (PM 2.5 and NO 2 ) and changes in cognitive function. However, the effect of PM 2.5 on cognitive decline was more pronounced in those without pre-existing stroke (p = 0.046), anxiety (p = 0.03) or stress (p = 0.01), all factors with p-value for interaction &lt;0.05 (Tallon et al., 2017). On the other hand, Tzivian et al.

On a similar note, the National Social Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) cohort study examined the effect of mood disorders on the association between air pollution and cognitive decline and found that the impacts of PM 2.5 and NO 2 on cognitive performance were mediated by depression and stress, respectively (Tallon et al., 2017).Pre-existent medical conditions have been suggested as effect modifiers, although results are inconclusive.

The findings remained significant after adjustment for several individual and community-level socioeconomic and demographic factors. The synergy between air pollution and neighbourhood stress in causing poor cognitive performance is consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to stress increases neuronal damage in response to toxic challenges (McEwen and Tucker, 2011).Education was investigated by Wellenius et al.

        <p>All of the studies on cognitive performance used standard cognitive tests. The MMSE has been widely used to assess general cognitive performance as well as cognitive impairment, though it was specifically designed as a screen for early impairment and is relatively poor at assessing some aspects of cognitive performance (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992). The threshold used to define impairment in the MMSE test varied among different studies from 18 to 26 out of a maximum score of 30 (Peters et al., 2015). In addition, whilst many studies focused on general cognition, relatively few analysed the cognitive domains comprehensively. For instance, Chen and Schwartz (2009) studied the effects of air pollution on attention, short-term memory, constructional praxis and coding ability, whilst Wellenius et al. (2012) focused on immediate, delayed and working memory, and language. Many other studies focused only on only one cognitive domain. Some studies assessed the effect of air pollution on dementia using prevalence and incidence of dementia documented in medical records (e.g. ICD-9 codes), which can lead to substantial misclassification. For example, a US-study identified that, in only 56% of subjects classified as having a dementia-associated disease according to their Medicare claims records, could the diagnosis be confirmed by more detailed clinical assessment (Taylor et al., 2009). This may be an example of over-diagnosis but under-diagnosis is also a problem since only around half of cases in the community are known to clinical services. Under-diagnosis in medical records may not be independent of air pollution exposure since subjects exposed to elevated air pollution are at higher risk of cardiorespiratory conditions, leading to frequent interaction with the medical community and perhaps an increased likelihood of diagnosis of dementia. Consistent with the advice of Power et al. (2016), some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings of studies relying on ICD-9 codes to evaluate the effect of air pollution on dementia. Some cohort studies have included representative sex and ethnicity strata, whilst others included one sex only (e.g. Weuve et al., 2012) or assessed only a selected population group (e.g. Ranft et al., 2009). The age of the participants has been diverse though most studies have focused on the elderly, who are at greater risk of cognitive decline. However, subjects with the highest exposure and/or poorest levels of cognition are less likely to participate in this type of study and are more likely to discontinue participation in longitudinal studies, leading to selection bias. Some studies are clearly not representative of the general population (e.g. Wurth et al., 2018).All of the studies on cognitive performance used standard cognitive tests. The MMSE has been widely used to assess general cognitive performance as well as cognitive impairment, though it was specifically designed as a screen for early impairment and is relatively poor at assessing some aspects of cognitive performance (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992). The threshold used to define impairment in the MMSE test varied among different studies from 18 to 26 out of a maximum score of 30 (Peters et al., 2015). In addition, whilst many studies focused on general cognition, relatively few analysed the cognitive domains comprehensively. For instance, Chen and Schwartz (2009) studied the effects of air pollution on attention, short-term memory, constructional praxis and coding ability, whilst Wellenius et al. (2012) focused on immediate, delayed and working memory, and language. Many other studies focused only on only one cognitive domain. Some studies assessed the effect of air pollution on dementia using prevalence and incidence of dementia documented in medical records (e.g. ICD-9 codes), which can lead to substantial misclassification. For example, a US-study identified that, in only 56% of subjects classified as having a dementia-associated disease according to their Medicare claims records, could the diagnosis be confirmed by more detailed clinical assessment (Taylor et al., 2009). This may be an example of over-diagnosis but under-diagnosis is also a problem since only around half of cases in the community are known to clinical services. Under-diagnosis in medical records may not be independent of air pollution exposure since subjects exposed to elevated air pollution are at higher risk of cardiorespiratory conditions, leading to frequent interaction with the medical community and perhaps an increased likelihood of diagnosis of dementia. Consistent with the advice of Power et al. (2016), some caution should be exercised in interpreting the findings of studies relying on ICD-9 codes to evaluate the effect of air pollution on dementia. Some cohort studies have included representative sex and ethnicity strata, whilst others included one sex only (e.g. Weuve et al., 2012) or assessed only a selected population group (e.g. Ranft et al., 2009).

        <p>Most of the reviewed articles included versions of logistic and linear regression with adjustment for a range of relevant potential covariates, although some made very crude adjustments for socio-demographic confounders. Hence, the possibility of residual confounding remains. Those studies which appropriately adjusted for socio-demographic covariates tended to report associations. The magnitude of the risks reported from individual studies will be a function of the health outcomes and exposures to air pollution. Exposures need to be assigned to health outcomes, with both aligned in space and time, the latter allowing for the expected lag between exposures and outcome.Most of the reviewed articles included versions of logistic and linear regression with adjustment for a range of relevant potential covariates, although some made very crude adjustments for socio-demographic confounders.

        <p>In the case of spatial alignment, assigning exposures to individuals and/or populations in an observational study will, of necessity, often involve a degree of approximation. Exposures are commonly based on measurements from ground monitors that are located in proximity to an individual's place of residence, or the average of measurements within an administrative area in which a population resides. Alternatively, assignment of exposures may be based on modelled concentrations, again often at the place of residence or, in aggregated form, to an administrative area. The use of air quality monitors, geo-statistical modeling, or surrogate measures of exposure based on distance to major roads may not adequately reflect individual exposures of subjects participating in the cohort studies. None of the studies has determined individual exposures or adjusted for personal activity patterns. The approaches used in the reviewed studies might be valid for pollutants that disperse homogeneously over the urban landscape (e.g. PM 2.5 ), but would be less appropriate for pollutants with a heterogeneous distribution influenced by local sources (e.g. BC, NO x , O 3 ) or with shorter persistence times (e.g. PM 10-2.5 ). Measurement error may also explain some of the inconsistencies observed in the cognitive effect estimates.In the case of spatial alignment, assigning exposures to individuals and/or populations in an observational study will, of necessity, often involve a degree of approximation.

        <p>Temporal alignment of health outcomes and exposures over time can be problematic due to the lack of availability of measurements (and/or modelled estimates) for specific pollutants of interest over the required time period, especially where long-term exposure is of interest. This can lead to misclassification of exposure over both space and time.Temporal alignment of health outcomes and exposures over time can be problematic due to the lack of availability of measurements (and/or modelled estimates) for specific pollutants of interest over the required time period, especially where long-term exposure is of interest.

        <p>Examples of temporal misalignment include studies in which exposure data were gathered at times different from those of the cognitive tests (generally prior to cognitive testing), which is in line with the Bradford-Hill temporality feature of causality. Many of the reviewed studies assessed chronic exposure to air pollution at the current residence of the participants, using a single mean or a composite chronic exposure measure covering less than a 5-year period. Many studies used shorter periods (e.g. 1-2 year) (e.g. Ailshire and Clarke, 2015;Wilker et al., 2015), whilst other studies and those assessing incident dementia considered exposures of up to 7-14 years (H. Chen et al., 2017a;J.C. Chen et al., 2017;Jung et al., 2015;Wu et al., 2015). It may be important to assess the cumulative exposure of a subject given the residential history. However, length of residence at the same residential address was not mentioned in most of the studies. For those subjects who had changed residence, current residential exposures may not be good surrogates of long-term exposures. The approach might be appropriate if the measured and aetiological windows were close in time but the validity is questionable over longer intervals (Power et al., 2016). This is of special relevance in the current discussion, since the development of dementia involves a long prodromal phase, generally over 2 or more decades. Hence recent exposures might not be reflective of the window of exposure critical for the health effect under consideration.Examples of temporal misalignment include studies in which exposure data were gathered at times different from those of the cognitive tests (generally prior to cognitive testing), which is in line with the Bradford-Hill temporality feature of causality.

        <p>Many of the studies have a cross-sectional design. If the impact of air pollution on cognition is subtle, multiple testing with detailed neuropsychological tests over time would be required to observe any significant effect. Hence, longitudinal design including multiple cognitive testing and exposure measurements over a period of time would be very useful to identify critical or sensitive periods within the life course.Many of the studies have a cross-sectional design.

        <p>Studies that included a large variation in estimated exposure were more likely to report significant associations, whereas those with small exposure variability were more likely to yield heterogeneous or largely null results. The magnitude and significance of risks may be sensitive to the characterisation of exposures in statistical models that are used to estimate the risks (and associated measures of uncertainty). The relationships between exposures and health outcomes may be non-linear but the use of non-linear models (for the exposure-health relationship) is not common in this setting. If the relationship is non-linear, then assuming linearity may result in biased estimates of risk. This may be overcome to some extent by categorising exposures but the choice of boundaries for individual categories can itself have an effect on the resulting risk estimates. In addition to the issues associated with the exposure-outcome relationship, the uncertainty associated with estimated exposures when using modelled estimates, or the temporal misalignment between exposures and health outcomes is rarely acknowledged. A complex form of 'measurement error' (Gryparis et al., 2009), can result in bias in both estimates and associated uncertainties and thus potentially in subsequent conclusions based on significance. Bradford Hill's guidelines are mainly focused on avoiding Type I errors: i.e. rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e. that there is not an effect) when in fact it is true. It can be argued that under the precautionary principle, the Type II error, making the opposite mistake and accepting the null hypothesis that there is no effect when in fact there is an effect (i.e. the null hypothesis is false) is more important when public health is at risk. The problem in statistical terms is that as the risk of making a Type I error reduces, the risk of making a Type II error increases. The likelihood of avoiding a Type I error is defined by the p value (commonly 0.05); whereas the capability to avoid a Type II error is defined by the power of the statistical test. Increasing the number of subjects studied is the only way of avoiding both error types in well-designed epidemiological studies, e.g. free from bias and unmeasured confounding. The sample size of many of the cohort studies was large (N &gt; 700) to very large (N &gt; 9.8 million) implying high statistical power and high power to avoid Type I and Type II errors in the reported results. The large sample size also implies that effect sizes rather than statistical significance need to be considered. The effect sizes may be over-estimated by the inability to account for the effect that cognitive performance at earlier stages of life might have in defining exposure to air pollution. For example, people with higher cognitive abilities might migrate to urban areas, generally characterised with poor air quality, where more working opportunities are available, i.e. the healthy migrant effect. Although this earlier selection would not explain the effects of lifetime exposure. Some of the studies of a lower number of participants (190-400) nonetheless reported significant associations (e.g. Sanchez-Rodriguez et al., 2006). The studies assessing neurological biomarkers examined responses in small numbers of participants (typically 20-60), which probably contributed to the heterogeneity of the results, affecting their validity and generalizability.Studies that included a large variation in estimated exposure were more likely to report significant associations, whereas those with small exposure variability were more likely to yield heterogeneous or largely null results.

In addition, despite the large number of participants in some studies (8.000-750.000) and a few very largescale studies based on electronic medical records in North America (2.2-9.8 millions), most of the studies have been of much smaller cohorts. The few very large studies would dominate meta-analysis calculations to an extent that would mean that any overall estimates might not fairly represent the current field of knowledge.As the studies used a variety of cognitive tests to assess outcome, and a diverse range of air pollutants was considered (Clifford et al., 2016), formal meta-analysis was deemed not appropriate.

        <p>Coming to a view on the effects of different pollutants is also not possible at this stage as the pollutants responsible for the observed outcomes cannot be identified with confidence from the epidemiological literature. Likewise, it is difficult at this stage to evaluate whether air pollution exposure predominantly affects functioning in any particular cognitive domain (Power et al., 2016). In addition, the effect estimates are non-comparable, precluding evaluation of the likelihood of publication bias (Clifford et al., 2016;Power et al., 2016).Coming to a view on the effects of different pollutants is also not possible at this stage as the pollutants responsible for the observed outcomes cannot be identified with confidence from the epidemiological literature.

        <p>The current review of the literature on the association between ambient air pollution exposure and cognition has strengths and limitations. A strength of the current review is its comprehensiveness exploring the epidemiological evidence across 12 different outcomes related to cognitive decline and dementia.

Another strength of this review is that it is based on an exhaustive search of the literature and includes recently published epidemiological evidence (i.e., up to December 2019).

        <p>Temporal misalignment (of putative causes and effects) could potentially affect the documentation of associations between exposure to air pollution and cognitive and neurological changes. Most of the studies considered exposures representative of one to ten years prior to cognitive testing, dementia incidence or neuroimaging. However, exposures over that period of time might not be representative of exposures over a longer term (e.g. 30 years), which may well be more relevant to the effect under consideration.Temporal misalignment (of putative causes and effects) could potentially affect the documentation of associations between exposure to air pollution and cognitive and neurological changes.

        <p>However, the studies are not consistent in which pollutant they report as being most closely associated with these adverse effects on cognition. Some studies that have included traffic load or distance and components of air pollution have suggested associations with traffic but not with air pollutants (Ranft et al., 2009;Wellenius et al., 2012), whilst other have found associations with air pollutants but not with traffic load or distance (Schikowski et al., 2015;Wilker et al., 2015). It is therefore unclear whether the exposure mainly associated with cognitive decline and dementia is a specific component of air pollution, the urban air pollution mixture, or factors related to urbanicity and traffic exposure, such as poorer socio-economic status (i.e. poorer people tend to be near major traffic roadsides). It could be also related to any of the multiple features of urban living such as noise, stress, exposure to artificial light at night, poor access to green spaces, sedentarism, unbalanced diet. The diversity of study designs and the end-points makes meta-analysis inappropriate.However, the studies are not consistent in which pollutant they report as being most closely associated with these adverse effects on cognition.
