        <p>BACKGROUND: Depression has been associated with metabolic alterations, which adversely impact cardiometabolic health. Here, a comprehensive set of metabolic markers, predominantly lipids, was compared between depressed and nondepressed persons. METHODS: Nine Dutch cohorts were included, comprising 10,145 control subjects and 5283 persons with depression, established with diagnostic interviews or questionnaires. A proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform provided 230 metabolite measures: 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites; 98 lipid composition and particle concentration measures of lipoprotein subclasses; and 81 lipid and fatty acids ratios. For each metabolite measure, logistic regression analyses adjusted for gender, age, smoking, fasting status, and lipid-modifying medication were performed within cohort, followed by random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Of the 51 lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites, 21 were significantly related to depression (false discovery rate q , .05). Higher levels of apolipoprotein B, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, tyrosine, and isoleucine and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, acetate, and apolipoprotein A1 were associated with increased odds of depression. Analyses of lipid composition indicators confirmed a shift toward less high-density lipoprotein and more very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride particles in depression. Associations appeared generally consistent across gender, age, and body mass index strata and across cohorts with depressive diagnoses versus symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale meta-analysis indicates a clear distinctive profile of circulating lipid metabolites associated with depression, potentially opening new prevention or treatment avenues for depression and its associated cardiometabolic comorbidity.BACKGROUND: Depression has been associated with metabolic alterations, which adversely impact cardiometabolic health.

With a high annual (6%) and lifetime (19%) prevalence, depression is among the leading contributors to global disease burden (1,2). It has been associated with an increased risk of somatic disease, including cardiometabolic conditions, such as metabolic syndrome (3), obesity (4), diabetes mellitus (5), stroke (6), and cardiovascular disease (7), as well as an increased risk of all-cause mortality (8).https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.08.016 Depression imposes a huge burden on individuals and society (1).

        <p>Depression is correlated with metabolic alterations in peripheral bodily systems (1). A systematic review (9) summarizing metabolomics analyses of urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood samples of patients with depression highlighted a set of altered metabolites implicated in energy metabolism, neuronal integrity, and transmission. Meta-analyses showed that depression was associated with increased blood levels of total cholesterol (10) and triglycerides (TG) (3) and decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (11), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (3), and u-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (12). However, considerable heterogeneity was noted between studies, which was partly explained by differential lipid classifications (11).Depression is correlated with metabolic alterations in peripheral bodily systems (1).

        <p>Alterations in circulating lipid concentrations may be linked to pathophysiological pathways related to depression, such as chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or chronic low-grade inflammation (1). Glucocorticoid-induced hypercortisolemia is known to result in lipolysis, the release of fatty acids and synthesis of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (13). Similarly, activation of the proinflammatory response leads to a reduction in HDL cholesterol and phospholipids and an increase in TG caused by the compensatory production and accumulation of phospholipid-rich VLDL (14). In addition, u-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties, impact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning, promote cell membrane fluidity, and are involved in the regulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, which can be altered in depression (15). Alterations of circulating concentrations of lipids may also represent a consequence of depression. Patients with depression are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as sedentariness, excessive alcohol use, and poor nutrition (with preference for highly palatable food rich in saturated fats), which may lead to dyslipidemia (16) that can result in metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.Alterations in circulating lipid concentrations may be linked to pathophysiological pathways related to depression, such as chronic activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis or chronic low-grade inflammation (1).

        <p>Emerging technologies allow high-throughput profiling of lipids and other metabolites, which has led to efforts of determining metabolic signatures of various diseases (17,18). A few studies have applied this to depression (19,20), but the results remain inconsistent (21,22); this is partly due to different methodologies used and different metabolites (lipids, amino acids, and other small molecules) analyzed (23).Emerging technologies allow high-throughput profiling of lipids and other metabolites, which has led to efforts of determining metabolic signatures of various diseases (17,18).

        <p>This study aimed to identify plasma lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites associated with depression by analyzing data from 9 Dutch clinical and population-based studies and to assess consistency of findings across studies. A strength of the study is that all metabolites were measured around the same time with the same targeted proton nuclear magnetic resonance platform that quantifies lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites, including those that have been related to consequences of depression [e.g., insulin resistance (24), onset of cardiovascular events (25), and mortality (26)].This study aimed to identify plasma lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites associated with depression by analyzing data from 9 Dutch clinical and population-based studies and to assess consistency of findings across studies.

        <p>Depression. The presence of depression was measured either before blood sampling or up to a maximum of 1 month after blood sampling. Subjects were defined as cases when meeting all the criteria required for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder in clinical structured interviews in 4 cohorts or when scoring above a validated clinical cutoff score in depression questionnaires in 5 cohorts (see Table S1 in Supplement 1 for all instruments and definitions). In the main analyses, cases included subjects with any history of depression in lifetime.Depression.

        <p>Metabolites. Supplement 1 shows details on blood collection (for each cohort), measurement, and processing of metabolite measurements. Using targeted high-throughput proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (Nightingale Health Ltd., Helsinki, Finland), 230 metabolites or metabolite ratios were reliably quantified from ethylenediamine tetraacetate plasma samples (35). This metabolomics platform has been used in large-scale epidemiological studies of diabetes (24), cardiovascular disease (25), mortality (26), and alcohol intake (36). To enhance interpretation, metabolites were classified into 3 clusters curated by Nightingale Health (37): 1) lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites (n = 51); 2) lipid composition and particle concentration measures of lipoprotein subclasses (n = 98); and 3) metabolite ratios (n = 81). Data were processed according to a shared protocol applied also in other studies of BBMRI-NL (38). In each cohort, values of metabolites that could not be quantified (#5 metabolites per cohort) were set as missing for all subjects. Furthermore, metabolite values in subjects with outlying concentrations (6 5 SD) were additionally set as missing. A value of 1 was added to all metabolite values (Supplement 1 includes extensive analyses indicating that the degree of bias potentially introduced by this transformation is likely negligible) that were subsequently natural log-transformed to approximate normality. The obtained values were scaled to standard deviation units in each cohort to enable comparison.Metabolites.

        <p>Per-metabolite logistic regression analyses were initially performed in each dataset. The dependent variable was depression, and independent variables were the 230 metabolite measurements. For the Netherlands Twin Register cohort, logistic regression using generalized estimating equations were conducted, accounting for family relatedness. All models were adjusted for age, gender, fasting status, use of lipid-modifying drugs listed under Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System code C10, and smoking (see Supplement 1 for measurements). All analyses were based on available data per metabolite (pairwise deletion). Dataset-specific estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analyses (restricted maximum-likelihood estimator) to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs). Heterogeneity of results between datasets was quantified by I 2 (39) along with 95% confidence intervals as recommended (40,41).Per-metabolite logistic regression analyses were initially performed in each dataset.

        <p>As body mass index (BMI) has been shown to be associated with depression (4) and metabolites (42) whether metabolic profiles were dependent on recent presence of depression, additional analyses were conducted comparing current depressed cases (depression present 61 month around blood sampling) and controls. We conducted sensitivity analyses in which we excluded subjects using antidepressant medication (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code N06A) to study the impact of depression apart from its treatment. Here, we a priori expected to find a less distinctive metabolomics profile, given that antidepressant medication prescriptions are more likely in individuals with higher depression severity. Correlations between estimates obtained from these sensitivity analyses and estimates obtained in the main analyses were computed to measure the impact of the factors considered. Four additional sets of stratified analysis were performed to explore whether associations between metabolites and depression were different as a function of 1) depression assessment (diagnosis vs. self-report instrument), 2) gender (men vs. women), 3) age (,50 years vs. $50 years) and 4) BMI (normal [18.50-24.9] vs. overweight [25.0-29.9] and vs. obesity [$30]). A Wald test was performed to test differences in effect sizes across these strata (43), and correlations between estimates obtained across strata were estimated. The false discovery rate (FDR) method ( 44) was applied to address multiple testing at the meta-analysis level for 230 metabolites. Metaanalyses were conducted with the

        <p>Figure 1 shows a polar plot with ORs of meta-analyses investigating associations between depression and the 51 metabolites after adjustment for gender, age, smoking, lipidmodifying drugs, and fasting status. Of these, 21 metabolites were associated with depression at FDR q , .05 (Table 2; Figure S1 in Supplement 1). Metabolites associated with a higher odds for depression were apolipoprotein B; remnant (non-HDL and non-LDL) cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, and mean diameter of VLDL; the glycerides and phospholipid markers diglycerides; TG in LDL, serum TG, TG in HDL, and TG in VLDL; the fatty acid measures total fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acid, and estimated fatty acid chain length; the inflammation marker glycoprotein acetyls; and the amino acids tyrosine and isoleucine. Higher levels of metabolites that were associated with a lower odds for depression were apolipoprotein A1, cholesterol content for HDL (in particular S1 in Supplement 1), association estimates were quite consistent across the different datasets, including the datasets enriched for cardiometabolic risk. To confirm this, we reran the analyses after removing 2 datasets (CODAM subgroup with type 2 diabetes mellitus and The Maastricht Study subgroup with type 2 diabetes mellitus) containing approximately 900 participants with established diabetes and elevated cardiovascular risk factors. Association estimates were highly concordant with estimates of the original analyses (r = .99); all 21 metabolites detected in the original analyses were associated at nominal level with depression (17 at FDR q , .05) (Table S3 in Supplement 1).Figure 1 shows a polar plot with ORs of meta-analyses investigating associations between depression and the 51 metabolites after adjustment for gender, age, smoking, lipidmodifying drugs, and fasting status.

        <p>This meta-analysis of metabolomics and depression is, to our knowledge, the largest of its kind. We analyzed data of more than 15,000 subjects from 9 Dutch clinical and populationbased studies in the Netherlands to identify metabolites associated with depression. Our findings showed that depression is associated with a metabolic signature toward less HDL and more VLDL and TG particles. More specifically, 21 plasma lipids, fatty acids, and low-molecular-weight metabolites were significantly related to depression: higher levels of apolipoprotein B, VLDL cholesterol, TG, diglycerides, total and monounsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid chain length, glycoprotein acetyls, tyrosine, and isoleucine, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol, acetate, and apolipoprotein A1. Associations were generally consistent across gender, age, and BMI strata and across cohorts using depression diagnoses versus depressive symptoms. These metabolic alterations in depression could potentially explain part of the increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in individuals with depression.This meta-analysis of metabolomics and depression is, to our knowledge, the largest of its kind.

        <p>Our findings that depression is related to higher VLDL, higher TG, and lower HDL are in line with previous research (3,11,45). In the present study, we predominantly found differences in absolute lipid measures of the VLDL subfractions, whereas findings with lipid measures to lipid ratios in VLDL were less consistently associated with depression. This suggests that the total amount of lipids, rather than the type of lipids, is the main contributor to associations of depression with VLDL. For other metabolites, previous studies indicated more mixed findings. We did not find associations for LDL cholesterol measures, which contrasts with a previous meta-analysis that showed associations between depression and increased LDL cholesterol (11). For measures of fatty acids, we observed that higher monounsaturated fatty acids, total fatty acids, and estimated fatty acids chain length were associated with an increased odds of depression. Most evidence for links with fatty acids in depression stems from research on u-3 fatty acids (12), for which we did not observe a consistent, significant association with depression in the present study. The finding of proinflammatory glycoprotein acetyls being positively associated with depression is in line with the large body of evidence linking inflammation to depression (46). The short chain fatty acid and ketone body acetate was lower in depression. It was hypothesized that a Western-style diet alters gut microbiome composition, resulting in lower acetate levels, which could subsequently induce depression (4). Furthermore, a smaller study found lower isoleucine levels in depression (47), which contrasts our findings. Finally, a review concluded that there was no association between tyrosine and depression (48), whereas we observed higher tyrosine in depression. Discrepancies could be explained by differences in study characteristics or variation in analytic approaches, such as selection of potentially confounding factors.Our findings that depression is related to higher VLDL, higher TG, and lower HDL are in line with previous research (3,11,45).

        <p>We additionally evaluated the impact of the time frame of depression assessment on the results. In secondary analyses, including cases with current depression only, associations tended to become enhanced, suggesting that metabolomics alterations represent state markers reflecting current depression. Nevertheless, a similar profile of associations was found when analyzing depression cases defined in a broader time frame. The metabolic signature identified may therefore also represent a persisting biological scar after remission of depression or a preexisting underlying vulnerability factor for development of depression.We additionally evaluated the impact of the time frame of depression assessment on the results.

        <p>The impact of antidepressant medication use on the results was explored in secondary analyses, although this observational study precludes definitive conclusions, as depression severity most likely represents the clinical indication for antidepressant treatment (confounded by indication) (49). We reanalyzed data after excluding antidepressant users and found that the strength of associations was attenuated. Furthermore, the reduction in effective sample size substantially impacted the power to find significant associations. Nevertheless, directions of associations were highly consistent with those obtained in the full sample. Furthermore, the literature shows that potential detrimental effects of antidepressants on dyslipidemia is evident mainly for tricyclic antidepressants (50,51). Data from the NESDA cohort (51), including patients from mental health care institutions and with the highest prevalence of antidepressant users (27%) (Table 1), showed that tricyclic antidepressants were prescribed only in 3% of the participants. As the overall prevalence of antidepressant use in other cohorts included in the present metaanalysis was lower than approximately 9%, it could be assumed that the number of users of tricyclic antidepressants may be limited. This observation, combined with the results of our sensitivity analyses, suggests that antidepressant use is unlikely to be the major driver of the associations between metabolites and depression.The impact of antidepressant medication use on the results was explored in secondary analyses, although this observational study precludes definitive conclusions, as depression severity most likely represents the clinical indication for antidepressant treatment (confounded by indication) (49).

        <p>Secondary analyses also indicated that results were generally attenuated when BMI was taken into account, suggesting that part of the differential metabolite levels in depression could be explained by BMI. However, interrelationships between BMI, metabolites, depression, and antidepressants are particularly complex. A significant genetic correlation has been found between depression and BMI (52), indicating that they may emerge from partially shared etiological mechanisms; at the same time, BMI has been shown to influence metabolite concentrations (42). The ability to disentangle different independent effects of this complex network in observational data is limited. Nevertheless, the majority of metabolites were associated with depression after taking into account BMI, indicating that this factor explains only a limited portion of the depression-metabolites link.Secondary analyses also indicated that results were generally attenuated when BMI was taken into account, suggesting that part of the differential metabolite levels in depression could be explained by BMI.

        <p>The present findings may be explained by 3 non-mutually exclusive scenarios. First, alterations of lipids may be a consequence of depression. Depressed persons are more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as sedentariness, excessive alcohol use, and poor nutrition (e.g., saturated fats), which may lead to dyslipidemia (16). Second, lipid dysregulations may be part of the pathophysiological pathways implicated in depression, such as chronic hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis and inflammatory activity, resulting in lipolysis, release of fatty acids, synthesis of VLDL, hypertriglyceridemia, and reduction in HDL cholesterol.

A recent genome-wide association study of major depression involving .450,000 participants reported a significant genetic correlation (r g = .14, p = 7.8 3 10 27 ) with high TG levels, but not with LDL or HDL (53). Furthermore, no genetic correlations emerged with metabolites of the same panel that we found to be associated with depression, although the relatively smaller sample size (approximately 25,000) of the metabolomics genome-wide association study may substantially limit the ability to detect correlations; the only exception was a nominally significant correlation with glycoprotein acetyls (r g = .15, p = .03), with the same direction of the phenotypic association we identified. Further experimental studies and genetically informed designs such as Mendelian randomization may disentangle whether depression and lipid dysregulations emerge from shared etiology and whether depression causally determines lipid alterations or vice versa.Biological Psychiatry March 1, 2020; 87:409-418 www.sobp.org/journal genetic factor.

        <p>The present study has some limitations. Owing to limited availability or differences in assessment across datasets, we cannot rule out confounding by other health-related or lifestyle factors, such as chronic cardiometabolic conditions, alcohol use, or specific food intake before sample collection. Nevertheless, the associations between depression and metabolites were consistent across datasets, including those enriched for traits such as diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors, and migraine. Furthermore, alcohol use may represent a mediating mechanism rather than a confounder in the metabolitesdepression association, as recent evidence (54) showed that alcohol dependence is to quite some extent caused by depression. Analyses were adjusted for fasting status (.94% of subjects were fasting) (Table 1), but both fasting and nonfasting samples can be reliably analyzed by the metabolomics platform used (26,35). We could not examine whether the associations with metabolites detected vary as a function of specific depression clinical characteristics. Strengths of the study (large samples, metabolites data generated for all studies with the same platform) have enabled the identification of the most reliable metabolic signals associated with depression. These are worth further examination in relation to clinically relevant phenotypes (e.g., age of onset, recurrence, duration, symptom profiles) in future studies based on psychiatrically well-characterized samples.The present study has some limitations.

This biological signature is partially shared with other conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases (3,5-7) that commonly co-occur with depression, heavily burdening public health resources.
