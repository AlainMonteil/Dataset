        <p>The Lacunar Intervention Trial-2 (LACI-2) was an investigator-initiated, open-label, blinded end-point, randomized clinical trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design. The trial aimed to recruit 400 participants from 26 UK hospital stroke centers between February 5, 2018, and May 31, 2021, with 12-month follow-up. Included participants had clinical lacunar ischemic stroke, were independent, were aged older than 30 years, had compatible brain imaging findings, had capacity to consent, and had no contraindications to (or indications for) the study drugs. Data analysis was performed on August 12, 2022. INTERVENTIONS All patients received guideline stroke prevention treatment and were randomized to ISMN (40-60 mg/d), cilostazol (200 mg/d), ISMN-cilostazol (40-60 and 200 mg/d, respectively), or no study drug.The Lacunar Intervention Trial-2 (LACI-2) was an investigator-initiated, open-label, blinded end-point, randomized clinical trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design.

        <p>Of the 400 participants planned for this trial, 363 (90.8%) were recruited. Their median age was 64 (IQR, 56.0-72.0) years; 251 (69.1%) were men. The median time between stroke and randomization was 79 (IQR, 27.0-244.0) days. A total of 358 patients (98.6%) were retained in the study at 12 months, with 257 of 272 (94.5%) taking 50% or more of the allocated drug.

        <p>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results show that the LACI-2 trial was feasible and ISMN and cilostazol were well tolerated and safe. These agents may reduce recurrent stroke, dependence, and cognitive impairment after lacunar stroke, and they could prevent other adverse outcomes in cSVD. Therefore, both agents should be tested in large phase 3 trials.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results show that the LACI-2 trial was feasible and ISMN and cilostazol were well tolerated and safe.

        <p>We included patients aged older than 30 years with clinical lacunar ischemic stroke syndrome (eg, pure motor hemipare-sis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, sensorimotor stroke, or dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome) and brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing either a visible relevant small subcortical (ie, lacunar) infarct or no alternative finding to account for the symptoms (no cortical infarct, hemorrhage, or mimic). We set no time limit between stroke and recruitment (detailed in Wardlaw 9 ), mainly because we aimed to avoid the period of use of dual antiplatelet agents in early secondary prevention; because lacunar ischemic stroke indicates cSVD, which is a chronic disorder; because recurrent stroke occurs late 13 ; and because we aimed to focus on long-term outcomes. Exclusion criteria were other active brain disease, kidney or hepatic impairment, dependence, and lack of capacity. 9 Central blinded reading of diagnostic CT and MRI brain imaging was performed to assess for the index stroke lesion, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, old infarcts or old hemorrhages, brain atrophy, and incidental pathology (all on CT and MRI) 14 as well as microbleeds and perivascular spaces (on MRI). 15We included patients aged older than 30 years with clinical lacunar ischemic stroke syndrome (eg, pure motor hemipare-sis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, sensorimotor stroke, or dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome) and brain computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing either a visible relevant small subcortical (ie, lacunar) infarct or no alternative finding to account for the symptoms (no cortical infarct, hemorrhage, or mimic).

        <p>This study has some limitations. Placebo was not available, although the follow-up coordinators were carefully masked to the allocated drug. During the trial, 8 follow-up coordinators worked from 2 separate centers, decreasing the likelihood of unmasking. The COVID-19 pandemic affected recruitment (4-month suspension in 2020 and a slow restart) and in-person follow-up (Trail Making Test Part B, blood pressure, and MRI results), and it may have contributed to the 10.9% of patients missing central follow-up. The comparison of ISMN-cilostazol vs no drugs was underpowered. Owing to safety concerns, we excluded patients who were dependent (mRS score &gt;2) or lacked capacity to consent, but future trials could include these pa- tients. While lacunar ischemic stroke affects men more than women (2:1 ratio), 20 future trials should attempt to increase recruitment of women. To streamline data collection, we did not collect data on race and ethnicity; future trials should record these data and include different racial and ethnic populations.This study has some limitations.

        <p>The LACI-2 trial also had several strengths. The web-based randomization minimization ensured that key prognostic variables and identifying information were secure and balanced at baseline. The distribution of trial work between 2 coordinating sites helped reduce the risk of systematic bias or unmasking. The trial benefitted from the UK National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network infrastructure. The pragmatic approach to patient inclusion reflected clinical practice and reduced barriers to recruitment and cost (eg, there were very few nonlacunar ischemic strokes and no stroke mimics), despite not mandating MRI. This improved the generalizability of LACI-2, since MRI is not universally accessible or tolerated. We included patients with clinically definite lacunar stroke but no relevant imaging-visible infarct, since they have similar recurrent stroke and dependence rates as those with visible infarction. 23 In fact, 88.2% of participants in LACI-2 had a relevant visible infarct with no evidence that outcomes differed by infarct presence or absence. The factorial design allowed testing of 2 drugs both individually and combined compared with guidelinebased stroke prevention; the comparisons are appropriate to this design and demonstrate superiority over guideline stroke prevention in lacunar stroke.The LACI-2 trial also had several strengths.

        <p>The composite outcome (recurrent stroke, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, and death) reflected the main outcomes 24 and concerns of patients with lacunar stroke and cSVD. 21 Both study drugs reduced some individual out-comes but not the composite, although ISMN-cilostazol did reduce composite outcomes. These findings are consistent with the global clinical outcome and global SIS, when assessing mRS scores and cognition in different ways and across subgroups including age, white matter hyper intensity score, cSVD score, and blood pressure, although LACI-2 was not powered to identify subgroup interactions.The composite outcome (recurrent stroke, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, and death) reflected the main outcomes 24 and concerns of patients with lacunar stroke and cSVD. 21 Both study drugs reduced some individual out-comes but not the composite, although ISMN-cilostazol did reduce composite outcomes.

        <p>Both ISMN and cilostazol have been widely used for ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or secondary prevention of atherothromboembolic stroke for years, with known, acceptable safety profiles. Despite concerns that adverse symptoms attributable to these drugs would discourage compliance, most patients remained in the trial (taking ≥50% of the allocated drug) for 1 year. The study drugs were administered in addition to guideline-based stroke secondary prevention (mostly clopidogrel in the UK) with no increased bleeding with cilostazol, consistent with findings reported in systematic reviews. 10,25 The lack of effect of cilostazol on recurrent stroke observed here differs from meta-analyses of secondary ischemic stroke prevention, 10,25 possibly reflecting longer treatment duration in prior trials, albeit in subgroup analyses. 10 Data for cilostazol on cognitive impairment or functional outcomes are sparse.Both ISMN and cilostazol have been widely used for ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, or secondary prevention of atherothromboembolic stroke for years, with known, acceptable safety profiles.

        <p>Results from LACI-2 demonstrate the strengths of composite and global analyses, compensating for low individual recurrent vascular events (5.3% for stroke and 1.1% for MI), and dependence rates (14.6%) that make it difficult to power cSVD trials using traditional stroke outcomes. This trial also shows the value of clinical end points, including cognition, in cSVD trials.Results from LACI-2 demonstrate the strengths of composite and global analyses, compensating for low individual recurrent vascular events (5.3% for stroke and 1.1% for MI), and dependence rates (14.6%) that make it difficult to power cSVD trials using traditional stroke outcomes.

        <p>The LACI-2 trial design was feasible in patients with lacunar stroke, and ISMN and cilostazol were tolerated and may be taken together safely, in addition to guideline stroke prevention, and may improve clinical outcomes including function, cognition, mood, and QOL. These results need confirmation in larger trials in lacunar stroke; the LACI-3 trial is in preparation. Endothelialstabilizing drugs like ISMN and cilostazol could be tested in covert cSVD to delay cognitive decline in patients at risk of or with early-stage vascular cognitive impairment, potentially in cSVDrelated intracerebral hemorrhage, and in non-cSVD stroke where cSVD features are common.The LACI-2 trial design was feasible in patients with lacunar stroke, and ISMN and cilostazol were tolerated and may be taken together safely, in addition to guideline stroke prevention, and may improve clinical outcomes including function, cognition, mood, and QOL.
