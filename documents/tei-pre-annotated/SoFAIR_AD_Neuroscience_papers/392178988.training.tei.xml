        <p>There is currently no agreement on which factor modulates most effectively and enduringly brain plasticity in bilingual individuals. Grouping heterogeneous linguistic profiles under a dichotomous condition (bilingualism versus monolingualism) may obscure critical aspects of language experience underlying neural changes, thus leading to variable and often conflicting findings. In the present study, we overcome these limitations by analyzing the individual and joint contribution of L2 AoA, proficiency and usageall measured as continuous variableson the resting-state functional connectivity of the brain networks mediating the specific demands of bilingual language processing: the language network and the executive control network. Our results indicate that bilingual experiencedefined as a continuous and multifaceted phenomenonimpacts brain plasticity by modulating the functional connectivity both within and between language and control networks. Each experience-related factor considered played a role in changing the connectivity of these regions. Moreover, the effect of AoA was modulated by proficiency and usage. These findings shed new light on the importance of modeling bilingualism as a gradient measure rather than an all-or-none phenomenon.There is currently no agreement on which factor modulates most effectively and enduringly brain plasticity in bilingual individuals.

        <p>It is well established that multiple languages are jointly activated and compete for selection in a bilingual mind (e.g., Guo and Peng, 2006;Marian and Spivey, 2003). Therefore, bilinguals must not only mentally store and instantiate the additional linguistic information acquired, but also selectively attend to one language and monitor from other languages' intrusions according to the given communicative circumstances. The neural bases of bilingual language control are largely overlapping with the neural infrastructure supporting domain-general executive control 1 functions (e.g., Branzi et al., 2016;Calabria et al., 2018). Both the acquisition and the context-dependent use of multiple languages may lead to functional and structural plastic changes in the brain. At the neuroanatomical level, bilingual experience and second language (L2) learning have been associated with volumetric and shape increases in several gray matter (GM) regions supporting language processing (e.g. Hosoda et al., 2013;Mårtensson et al., 2012) and bilingual language control (e.g. Abutalebi et al., 2012;Burgaleta et al., 2016), with early L2 learners and/or highly proficient L2 speakers showing greater GM density or maintenance than monolinguals (e.g., Del Maschio, Sulpizio, Gallo, Fedeli, Weekes and Abutalebi, 2018;Del Maschio, Fedeli, Sulpizio and Abutalebi, 2019;Klein et al., 2014;Mechelli, Crinion, Noppeney, O'doherty, Ashburner, Frackowiak and Price, 2004). In addition to local GM volume and shape, neuroimaging research has also focused on putative bilingualism-related effects on white matter (WM) structure, indicating, for instance, that proficient and highly immersed bilinguals display higher axonal density or myelination in WM tracts that connect regions which are critical for bilingual language processing, such as the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), and the caudate nucleus (e.g., Hosoda et al., 2013;Luk et al., 2011;Pliatsikas et al., 2015;Singh et al., 2018). Moreover, as an additional index of bilingualism-mediated plasticity, observed alterations in local GM and/or WM myelination have been investigated in relation to changes in brain function, with special reference to task-and context-independent (i.e., resting-state) functional connectivity. Although the available literature is limited, some recent evidence suggests that early (i.e., simultaneous) bilingualism affects the functional connectivity of language-related structures (Berken et al., 2016); it should be noted, however, that similar effects across both language-and control-related regions have also been ascribed to language proficiency (e.g., Li et al., 2015a,b).It is well established that multiple languages are jointly activated and compete for selection in a bilingual mind (e.g., Guo and Peng, 2006;Marian and Spivey, 2003).

        <p>Crucially, as the aforementioned findings suggest, being bilingual is not an all-or-none phenomenon that can be described as a dichotomous condition grouping extreme casese.g., people who have acquired an L2 before versus after a specific age threshold, or people who do or do not exhibit native-like L2 proficiency. L2 knowledge shows remarkable interindividual variability and can dramatically change throughout the lifespan depending on personal experience. Learner-internal variables such as motivation, engagement in L2 culture, and degree of identification with L2 speakers are also well known to condition L2 learning and attainment (D€ ornyei and Skehan, 2003). Accordingly, a better conceptualization of bilingualism should not only be centered on a qualitative perspective, but also take into account quantitative measures such as the extent to which individuals vary as bilinguals. This widening of perspective offers a more ecological description of bilingualism and can improve our understanding of bilingualism-associated brain plasticity. In the present study, we move along this direction and examine how inter-individual variability in bilingual experience predicts differences in the functional connectivity of brain networks responsible for language processing and control. In order to achieve this aim, we investigated a group of individuals (N ¼ 50) who varied along the three main dimensions usually defining bilingual experience: (a) The age of L2 onset (i.e., L2 age of acquisition, AoA); (b) the level of mastery attained in L2 (i.e., L2 proficiency); c) the relative frequency of daily use of first and second language (i.e., L1/L2 usage). We tested whether and to what extent bilingual experience impacts the functional organization of the language network and the control network using resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC), which measures spontaneous correlations in fluctuations of the BOLD signal during task-independent neural activity (Fox and Raichle, 2007;Smith et al., 2013).Crucially, as the aforementioned findings suggest, being bilingual is not an all-or-none phenomenon that can be described as a dichotomous condition grouping extreme casese.g., people who have acquired an L2 before versus after a specific age threshold, or people who do or do not exhibit native-like L2 proficiency.

        <p>The first view suggests that L2 AoA is the main driving force of plasticity (e.g. Berken et al., 2016;Kousaie et al., 2017). Since the brain is extremely malleable during development, having an early experience with a second language would significantly contribute to shape the functioning of language-related and control-related networks. Berken et al. (2016) showed that, compared to sequential bilinguals (i.e., L2 acquired after the age of 5), simultaneous bilinguals (two languages from birth) had stronger functional connectivity between the left IFG and its right counterpart, as well as between the IFG and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the cerebellum. Similar effects of L2 AoA on the interhemispheric connectivity of frontal regions have been recently reported by Gullifer et al. (2018), who investigated rs-FC in French-English bilinguals. In addition, Liu et al. (2017) explored the topological properties of a distributed language network (encompassing phonology-, semantics-and syntactic-related modules) in early versus late proficient Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals. Irrespective of L2 proficiency, late bilinguals (i.e., who learned L2 after the age of 6) were found to have weaker intra-and inter-modular functional connectivity.The first view suggests that L2 AoA is the main driving force of plasticity (e.g. Berken et al., 2016;Kousaie et al., 2017).

        <p>The second view proposes that functional brain changes are enabled and constrained mainly by L2 experience, in terms of proficiency and usage. In particular, the organization of language-and control-related networks would be optimized by the relative use and maintenance of multiple languages (e.g., Calabria et al., 2018). Thus, the alleged effect of AoA, rather than a hard biological constraint, would be an epiphenomenon of language use, given that early bilinguals typically employ their two languages for a longer period than late bilinguals. Consistent with this view, Li et al. (2015a,b) investigated rs-FC in monolinguals and highly proficient bimodal bilinguals who acquired Chinese sign language late in life (mean age: 19 years). Compared to monolinguals, bilinguals showed decreased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the left STG, and the left IFG, and increased connectivity between the left caudate nucleus and the right middle temporal gyrus, a region relevant for sign language processing. Moreover, Gullifer et al. (2018) reported that a balanced use of the two languages was associated with greater functional connectivity between the ACC and the putamen bilaterally, as well as between the left caudate and the STG bilaterally.The second view proposes that functional brain changes are enabled and constrained mainly by L2 experience, in terms of proficiency and usage.

        <p>The inconsistent findings that emerge from the rs-FC literature may have two sources: First, the variables under investigation, along with the focus on a single variable characterizing bilingual experience and not others; second, the characterization of bilingualism as a qualitative rather than quantitative phenomenon. In the present study, we overcome these limitations by analyzing the impact of L2 AoA, proficiency and usageall measured as continuous variableson the rs-FC of the two brain networks which are expected to mediate the specific demands of bilingual language processing: the language network and the control network. Since individual differences in bilingual experience may result from a combined effect of these variables, other than testing the effect of each variable per se, we also investigated their interactions. Our sample of Italian-English speakers collected in Milan is well suited for testing how different socio-linguistic factors interact to shape network plasticity. Indeed, while it increasingly represents an international economic hub where a multilingual environment is the rule rather than the exception, Milan continues to be characterized by a large variability in terms of bilingual experience, even among younger age groups. Whereas &gt;95% of students attend foreign language classes during their compulsory education (and &gt;98% learn English) (Eurostat, 2015), second language proficiency and usage vary broadly across individuals, largely depending on contextual and learner-internal factors.The inconsistent findings that emerge from the rs-FC literature may have two sources: First, the variables under investigation, along with the focus on a single variable characterizing bilingual experience and not others; second, the characterization of bilingualism as a qualitative rather than quantitative phenomenon.

        <p>With regard to language processing, we examined the contribution of bilingual experience to the functional connectivity of the core perisylvian language network, comprising the left IFG and the posterior part of the STG bilaterally. Even though abundant evidence has been provided that the neural substrate for language processing is not restricted to this network, all major neurocognitive models consider the IFG and the STG as the key components of language functioning (e.g., Friederici, 2011;Hagoort, 2016;Hickok and Poeppel, 2004). Moreover, although being bilingual does not change the core language network (i.e., the network involved in language processing is the same for mono-and bilinguals), especially poorly proficient and less exposed bilinguals are faced with higher language-processing demands than their monolingual peers (for a review, see Costa and Sebasti an-Gall es, 2014), with potential alterations of the functional connections between language regions. Based on previous evidence (Grant et al., 2015;Yang et al., 2015), we hypothesize that both L2 proficiency and usage might increase the strength of connections between core language areas. Language use may also modulate the connectivity between language-related and control-related regions: According to the Adaptive Control Hypothesis (Green, 1998;Green and Abutalebi, 2013), the more a bilingual uses her/his two languages, the more she/he will be able to keep active the to-be-used language while inhibiting the to-be-ignored language (see, Li et al., 2015,b). However, changes in the connectivity of the language network might also be driven by L2 AoA, with early acquisition enhancing the efficiency of language-related regions (see Berken et al., 2016;Liu et al., 2017). This hypothesis also follows from recent evidence on structural connectivity: H€ am€ al€ ainen et al. ( 2017) have shown that, compared to a later L2 onset (i.e., after the age of 5), an earlier acquired language is associated with increased fractional anisotropy along the arcuate fasciculus, the path connecting the regions of the language network.With regard to language processing, we examined the contribution of bilingual experience to the functional connectivity of the core perisylvian language network, comprising the left IFG and the posterior part of the STG bilaterally.

        <p>As far as language control is concerned, neuroimaging evidence indicates that bilinguals control and switch between languages by means of a cortico-subcortico-cerebellar network including: PFC, bilateral ACC, inferior parietal lobules (IPLs), thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (see Abutalebi and Green, 2016). In this study, we tested the modulation effect of bilingual experience on the functional connectivity of these structures. If changes in connectivity are mainly driven by the long-term use of multiple languagesin accordance with Green and Abutalebi's Adaptive Control Hypothesis and findings in Li et al. (2015a,b) and Gullifer et al. (2018) -, then we can expect an increase in functional connectivity as a function of L2 usage. These changes would result from the extensive recruitment of regions underpinning bilingual language control as well as their interaction with perisylvian nodes. Enhanced functional connectivity between these structures may also correlate with practice in language control, here quantified by self-assessed measures of code-switching, the context-dependent tendency to alternate between or mixing two languages. However, if remodeling of functional networks is conditional on the timing of L2 acquisitionsince the brain is maximally plastic during early development -, then the connectivity of control regions might be modulated only (or mainly) by L2 AoA; in such a perspective, only an early acquisition would guarantee the use of the same neurocognitive mechanisms for both languages (e.g., Abrahamsson, 2012;Ullman, 2016).As far as language control is concerned, neuroimaging evidence indicates that bilinguals control and switch between languages by means of a cortico-subcortico-cerebellar network including: PFC, bilateral ACC, inferior parietal lobules (IPLs), thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (see Abutalebi and Green, 2016).

        <p>All participants were native Italian speakers who spoke English as an L2. In order to qualify participants' bilingual experience, L2 AoA, L2 proficiency, Language Entropy (a measure of language usage; for details, see below), and participants' language switching habits were collected for all participants. L2 AoA was measured by asking participants the timing of L2 acquisition. To establish L2 proficiency, the online Cambridge test for adult learners (http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/testyour-english/general-english/) was administered to all participants (see Sulpizio et al., 2019). The test is composed of 25-items that evaluate English grammatical and conversational knowledge. The score goes from 0 to 25 and provides an estimation of English proficiency in terms of the reference levels defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (i.e., A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2). To evaluate L2 vocabulary knowledge, participants also completed a second proficiency assessment consisting in a L1-to-L2 90-items translation task (i.e., 30 high-frequency, 30 medium-frequency, and 30 low-frequency words) (see Abutalebi et al., 2012).All participants were native Italian speakers who spoke English as an L2.

        <p>Language Entropy was measured by computing Shannon Entropy (H), which provides a continuous measure of how often one or the two languages are used (for a similar approach, see Gullifer et al., 2018). First, participants were asked to estimate how many hours per day they were exposed to L1 and L2 on different in-class/work-related and out-of-class/extra-work language associated activities; then these measures were used to quantify a proportion of L1 and L2 use for each participant by dividing the use of a given language by the sum of the use of the two languages. Finally, Shannon Entropy (H) associated with proportional L1 and L2 use (i.e., Language Entropy) was computed using the following equation:Language Entropy was measured by computing Shannon Entropy (H), which provides a continuous measure of how often one or the two languages are used (for a similar approach, see Gullifer et al., 2018).

        <p>In order to further qualify participants' bilingual experience, switching habits were estimated using the Bilingual Switching Questionnaire (BSWQ; Rodriguez-Fornells et al., 2012), a 12-items self-assessment questionnaire aimed to detect individual differences in language switching. The questionnaire can be decomposed into four constructs which measure different aspects of switching habits: L1 switching tendencies (L1s) and L2 switching tendencies (L2s) measure the tendency to switch, respectively, to L1 and L2; contextual switch (CS) assesses the frequency of switches in particular situations or environments; unintended switch (US) measures the lack of awareness of language switches. Participants were required to evaluate the degree to which a behavior characterized his/her language switching habits using a five-point scale (from 1-never to 5-always); the score goes from 0 to 15 for each component (three items for each construct).

No participant was discarded during this step. All images were slice-time corrected. Participants' motion estimation and correction were then carried out through functional realignment and unwarping and potential outlier scans were identified using the

Structural images were segmented into Gray matter, White matter and Cerebrospinal Fluid tissues and normalized to the Montr eal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with the unified segmentation and normalization procedure (Ashburner and Friston, 2005). Functional volumes were normalized and smoothed with a 8 mm Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.

Realignment parameters, potential outlier scans, signal from white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks and effect of rest (i.e. an automatically estimated trend representing potential ramping effects in the BOLD timeseries at the beginning of the sessions), were entered as potential confound regressors into the model in the denoising step of the

        <p>Graph theory. According to graph theory, the brain can be modeled as a graph whose nodes (functional brain regions) are interconnected by edges (functional connections) (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009). We used CONN to estimate the following topological properties of the language and control networks: global efficiency (i.e., the average of the inverse shortest path distance between each node and all other nodes in the graph) and local efficiency (i.e., the efficiency of a sub-graph consisting only of nodes neighboring a certain node) (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012). In order to compute these measures, the entire matrix of ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity values was computed for each participant. In ROI-to-ROI rs-FC analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficients are first computed between the residual BOLD time course from the ROI and the time course of all the other ROIs within the same network, and then converted with the same procedure described for the seed-to-voxel analysis. Finally, participant-specific ROI-to-ROI connectivity matrix was thresholded at a cost value of k ¼ 0.4, chosen as small world properties observed at this threshold (i.e., global efficiency greater than that of a lattice graph and local efficiency greater than that of a random graph) (Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012). Negative functional connectivity values were disregarded in these analyses.Graph theory.

            <rs type="software">CONN toolbox</rs>. In seed-based rs-FC analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficients are computed between the residual BOLD time course from the seed and the time course of all the other voxels. Then, correlation coefficients are converted to normally distributed scores using Fisher's transform to allow for second-level GLM analysis. Key structures supporting language processing and bilingual language control were identified as target regions. The left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) were selected as target regions of the language network. These areas, assumed to be at the core of language processing by the major neurocognitive models of language (e.g., Friederici, 2011;Hagoort, 2016;Hickok and Poeppel, 2004), were selected from the pre-defined network masks in CONN. For bilingual language control, target regions were selected based on Abutalebi and Green (2016) and defined through the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). The following control areas were selected: bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG); bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG); bilateral inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis (IFGop), pars triangularis (IFGtri) and pars orbitalis (IFGorb); bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA); bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); bilateral supramarginal gyrus (SMG); bilateral angular gyrus (AG); bilateral thalamus; left caudate nucleus; left putamen. All regions and their relative spatial coordinates are reported in Table 2.

As these measures did not strongly correlate with each other, the following interactions were performed: AoA by Proficiency, Language Entropy by Proficiency, and AoA by Language Entropy. Educational history, gender and TIB were included in the model as nuisance covariates.

As switching between languages requires control processes (e.g., disengaging from the old task and engaging with the new one; Green and Abutalebi, 2013), the relationship between switching habits and the rs-FC of regions involved in language processing and control was explored. To analyze this relation, Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients (i.e., connectivity values) between each pair of seed and suprathreshold cluster were extracted for each participant from CONN. Then, Spearman's correlation analyses were performed between connectivity values and switching measures (i.e., L1s, L2s, CS and US).Correlation analysis between switching habits and connectivity.

        <p>In the present study, we investigated the impact of bilingual experience on the functional connections of brain networks responsible for the processing and control of two languages. In order to achieve this goal, a renovated conceptualization of bilingualism was adopted which frames the phenomenon as a gradient and composite measure encompassing both static (i.e., L2 AoA) and dynamic factors (i.e., L2 proficiency and usage). We explored the individual and joint contribution of these factors in shaping the functional organization of the language and control networks. In what follows, we first discuss the results for each network separately; then, we discuss the general implications of our findings for bilingualism research.In the present study, we investigated the impact of bilingual experience on the functional connections of brain networks responsible for the processing and control of two languages.

Since the precuneus has been found to contribute to attentional operations (e.g., Cavanna and Trimble, 2006;Utevsky et al., 2014) and has been repeatedly associated with language switching in bilinguals (e.g., Garbin et al., 2011;Reverberi et al., 2015), the modulation of the functional connections between pSTG and precuneus may be linked with the ability to successfully direct attention to the lexico-phonological representations of the to-be-used language. In such a perspective, as AoA increases, the more a bilingual becomes proficient, the more she/he would be able to efficiently integrate phonological and semantic representations of the language in use, resulting in stronger connectivity between pSTG and precuneus. Supporting evidence for this interpretation comes from the positive correlation between the pSTG-precuneus connectivity and L2-switch, which requires bilinguals to focus on the lexico-phonological representation of the second (typically weaker) language. An early L2 onset per se, however, irrespective of L2 proficiency, may be associated with increased efficiency in handling lexico-phonological representations from active languages that compete for selection, resulting in a more efficient lexical mapping (Hernandez et al., 2005). This would explain the lack of a significant association between higher L2 proficiency and stronger integration among language-and control-related systems in bilinguals who acquired their L2 at an earlier age.The left pSTG, a critical region for word comprehension, integrates auditory-phonological and conceptual processing (e.g., Bonilha et al., 2017;Hickok and Poeppel, 2004).

        <p>The analysis of the topological properties of the control network showed that a higher L2 proficiency was associated with higher levels of local efficiency. Local efficiency is typically associated to the fault tolerance of a network to the elimination of random nodes (Achard and Bullmore, 2007), that is the ability of a subgraph to transmit information at a local level. This finding may suggest that an increase in L2 proficiency enhances the functional segregation of clusters within the control network, thereby optimizing local information processing.The analysis of the topological properties of the control network showed that a higher L2 proficiency was associated with higher levels of local efficiency.

        <p>Seed-to-voxel analysis showed changes in functional connectivity between control regions and areas both within and outside the control network. Within the control network, the main findings come from the interaction between AoA and Language Entropy, which modulates the connectivity between left putamen and left SMA (as seed regions) and left SMA and left caudate, respectively. Higher values of Language Entropy (i.e., living in a fully integrated context, where each language is used equally) were associated to enhanced connectivity, especially in late bilinguals. These data support the view that the degree of language usage shapes the strength of connections among control regions (e.g., Perani and Abutalebi, 2005;Perani et al., 2017). Moreover, the positive correlation between left SMA-left caudate connectivity and L2-switch in late bilinguals seems to indicate the bolstering of control-related networks as a result of selecting the target language and/or inhibiting the non-target language.Seed-to-voxel analysis showed changes in functional connectivity between control regions and areas both within and outside the control network.

        <p>A further result is the modulation of connectivity between the left caudate and the right cerebellum which emerges from the AoA by Proficiency interaction. This finding may suggest that, the earlier participants become bilinguals, the more a higher level of proficiency is associated with weaker connections. The left caudate has been proposed to support language control, by keeping track of the language in use and controlling for lexical interference (Alì et al., 2010;Crinion et al., 2006). The degree of left caudate involvement in language control has been inversely related to language proficiency (i.e., the higher the proficiency, the lower the caudate involvement: see Abutalebi et al., 2013a,b). Since the cerebellum plays a role in producing a fluent speech (e.g., Tyson et al., 2014) and resolving conflicting linguistic input (e.g., comprehending a sentence in L2 while listening to an interfering sentence in L1; Filippi et al., 2011), the weaker left caudate-cerebellum connectivity in early proficient bilinguals may be associated with the ability of these bilingual profiles to efficiently minimize the cross-linguistic interference.A further result is the modulation of connectivity between the left caudate and the right cerebellum which emerges from the AoA by Proficiency interaction.

        <p>The modulation of connectivity among control regions as a function of the interaction between static (L2 AoA) and dynamic variables (L2 proficiency and usage) is in line with the Adaptive Control Hypothesis (Green and Abutalebi, 2013), which posits that the control network essentially adapts to the demands of language control.The modulation of connectivity among control regions as a function of the interaction between static (L2 AoA) and dynamic variables (L2 proficiency and usage) is in line with the Adaptive Control Hypothesis (Green and Abutalebi, 2013), which posits that the control network essentially adapts to the demands of language control.</p>
        <p>With regard to connectivity changes between control regions and regions outside the control network, the AoA by Language Entropy interaction modulated the functional integration of the bilateral SMG with the left paracentral lobule, and that of the right SFG with the right rolandic operculum. Specifically, higher values of Language Entropy were found to be associated with a stronger connectivity between these regions, especially in bilinguals who acquired their L2 later in life. The connectivity of the right rolandic operculum with the left putamen was also shaped by the Proficiency by Language Entropy interaction, with higher Proficiency associated to a higher connectivity, but only in case of high Language Entropy (i.e., in a context characterized by a balanced use of the two languages). The rolandic operculum is involved in speech articulation, and plays an important role in motor control and subvocal rehearsal (e.g., Behroozmand et al., 2015;Brown et al., 2009;Vallar et al., 1997). Recently, evidence has been provided that this region is more extensively recruited during L2 speech processing in late than early bilinguals or monolinguals, suggesting that the rolandic operculum may support subvocal rehearsal of L2 sounds "which likely remain less interconnected than the sounds of the first language" (Archila- Suerte et al., 2015, p. 45). The putamen is known to be involved in the control of articulatory processes as well, in terms of motor implementation for both internal and external speech (Calabria et al., 2018). In bilinguals, its engagement has been attributed to the motor control of complex articulatory repertoires from multiple languages (e.g. Abutalebi et al., 2013a, b). Of note, in the present study an increased functional coupling between putamen and rolandic operculum was detected mainly in contexts of high Entropy.With regard to connectivity changes between control regions and regions outside the control network, the AoA by Language Entropy interaction modulated the functional integration of the bilateral SMG with the left paracentral lobule, and that of the right SFG with the right rolandic operculum.

        <p>Resting-state functional connectivity studies are characterized by a high variability of functional data due to multiple factors: Withinparticipants variability (e.g., Chen et al., 2015;S€ amann et al., 2010;Wong et al., 2012), brain atlas selection (e.g., Arslan et al., 2018;Wu et al., 2019), and preprocessing steps choices (e.g., Murphy and Fox, 2017). These factors can potentially jeopardize the reproducibility of a study. The choice of using the AAL atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) and following the CONN's standard preprocessing pipeline, both widely used and publicly available, increases the reproducibility of this study by making our data comparable to others' findings. Future investigations may validate our results either by replicating them in different contexts or by employing reproducibility metrics (e.g. split-half or leave one out methods; Li et al., 2015a,b;Su et al., 2016).Resting-state functional connectivity studies are characterized by a high variability of functional data due to multiple factors: Withinparticipants variability (e.g., Chen et al., 2015;S€ amann et al., 2010;Wong et al., 2012), brain atlas selection (e.g., Arslan et al., 2018;Wu et al., 2019), and preprocessing steps choices (e.g., Murphy and Fox, 2017).

        <p>Broadly speaking, and in accordance with recent trends in bilingualism research (e.g., DeLuca et al., 2019;Kousaie et al., 2017;Thomas-Sunesson et al., 2018), envisioning bilingualism as a gradient and composite phenomenon opens up new opportunities to investigate the impact of inter-individual variability in language experience on brain functioning. The operationalization of bilingualism as a continuum has two main advantages: First, it is more ecological, since it mirrors the intrinsic nature of bi-/multilingualism (i.e., heterogeneous across individuals and dynamic throughout life). Second, it allows for a more precise modeling of the effects of bilingual experience on the brain. The dichotomization of a continuous variable (e.g., proficiency or use) is in fact well-known to potentially reduce the amount of variance that can be explained, resulting in loss of statistical power and reliability (e.g., Baayen, 2004;Cohen, 1983).Broadly speaking, and in accordance with recent trends in bilingualism research (e.g., DeLuca et al., 2019;Kousaie et al., 2017;Thomas-Sunesson et al., 2018), envisioning bilingualism as a gradient and composite phenomenon opens up new opportunities to investigate the impact of inter-individual variability in language experience on brain functioning.

        <p>Another general observation emerging from our findings is the need to simultaneously consider the multiple experiential factors characterizing bilingualism. The results here reported suggest that all the variables considered -AoA, L2 proficiency, L1/L2 usageplay a role, but also that the impact of static variables such as AoA may be modulated by more dynamic factors such as proficiency and usage. As the Adaptive Control Hypothesis entails (Green and Abutalebi, 2013), a lifelong experience with bilingualism, which implies the continuous engagement in a cognitively stimulating activity, seems to be the main driving force which plastically shapes resting state functional connections. Note that the effect different experiential factors have on plasticity may be influenced by other sources of inter-individual variability, such as the linguistic distance between languages at the various levels of processing, or social factors such as cultural diversity and immigration status (cf. Bak, 2016). Our sample is highly homogeneous in this respect, but research on bilingualism should not neglect socio-linguistic variables that may contribute to better characterize both bilingualism and its neural consequences (cf. Surrain and Luk, 2019).Another general observation emerging from our findings is the need to simultaneously consider the multiple experiential factors characterizing bilingualism.

        <p>To conclude, the results of our study show that bilingual experiencedefined as a continuous and multifaceted phenomenonimpacts brain plasticity by modulating the functional connectivity both within and between language and control networks. All the experience-related factors considered played a role in changing the connectivity patterns of our regions of interest, with the more dynamic factors of proficiency and usage modulating the effect of AoA. The findings here provided substantiate the emerging approach to bilingualism as a gradient measure and advocates for a mind change in bilingualism research.To conclude, the results of our study show that bilingual experiencedefined as a continuous and multifaceted phenomenonimpacts brain plasticity by modulating the functional connectivity both within and between language and control networks.
