        <p>The effective mimicry of neurons is key to the development of neuromorphic electronics. However, artificial neurons are not typically capable of operating in biological environments, which limits their ability to interface with biological components and to offer realistic neuronal emulation. Organic artificial neurons based on conventional circuit oscillators have been created, but they require many elements for their implementation. Here we report an organic artificial neuron that is based on a compact nonlinear electrochemical element. The artificial neuron can operate in a liquid and is sensitive to the concentration of biological species (such as dopamine or ions) in its surroundings. The system offers in situ operation and spiking behaviour in biologically relevant environmentsincluding typical physiological and pathological concentration ranges (5-150 mM)-and with ion specificity. Small-amplitude (1-150 mV) electrochemical oscillations and noise in the electrolytic medium shape the neuronal dynamics, whereas changes in ionic (≥2% over the physiological baseline) and biomolecular (≥ 0.1 mM dopamine) concentrations modulate the neuronal excitability. We also create biohybrid interfaces in which an artificial neuron functions synergistically and in real time with epithelial cell biological membranes.The effective mimicry of neurons is key to the development of neuromorphic electronics.

        <p>Neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system and are used to transmit and process electrochemical signals. They operate in a liquid electrolyte and communicate with each other via gaps (synapses) between the axon of pre-synaptic neurons and the dendrite of post-synaptic neurons (Fig. 1a). Neuromorphic computing uses hardware-based implementations to mimic the behaviour of synapses and neurons 1 , for efficient brain-inspired computing. The approach could also be used to interface biology with electronics that share similar biocomputational primitives [2][3][4][5][6][7] . Synaptic phenomena-the gradual and activity-dependent coupling between neurons-are typically mapped onto memory devices, which can be binary, multistate or analogue.

        <p>In this Article, we report an organic artificial spiking neuron with electrobiochemical degrees of control that enable local and in situ neuromorphic sensing and biointerfacing. The organic artificial neuron (OAN) can operate in a liquid and shows inherent biosensing primitives. It consists of a compact nonlinear electrochemical element that exhibits negative differential resistance that is sensitive to the biological environment that hosts the OAN. The OAN responds to ionic species commonly found in the extracellular space, and its spiking response is sensitive to typical physiological and pathological ionic concentration ranges (5-150 mM). Small-amplitude (1-150 mV) electrochemical oscillations and noise in the electrolytic medium shape the neuronal firing properties. Therefore, the artificial neuron exhibits spiking properties (which are stable for &gt;10 5 spiking cycles) that depend on the local ionic, biomolecular or neurotransmitter species of the aqueous environment-behaviour that is analogous to a biological neuron that is surrounded by the extracellular space containing various biological carriers for signalling and processing (Fig. 1a). In particular, in situ changes in ionic (≥2% increase) and biomolecular (≥0.1 mM of dopamine) concentrations modulate the neuronal excitability and trigger spikes. Ion-specific oscillations for sodium (Na + ) and potassium (K + ) are also possible, providing a pathway for emulating ion channel dynamics. Furthermore, we create a biohybrid interface in which artificial neurons synergistically function with membranes of epithelial cells and where the biological membrane barrier modulates the spiking properties of the artificial neuron in real time.In this Article, we report an organic artificial spiking neuron with electrobiochemical degrees of control that enable local and in situ neuromorphic sensing and biointerfacing.

        <p>are used for the T 1 and T 2 channel, respectively 35,36 . The electrical characteristics of T 1 and T 2 are presented in Supplementary Fig. 1. The OECTs operate in aqueous environments and are sensitive to ionic species and polyatomic ions (Fig. 1c). For instance, the channel of T 1 consists of the organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor PEDOT:PSS (ref. 26 ). Both channel and gate of an OECT are in direct contact with the electrolyte. In the case of a p-type OECT, when a positive gate voltage V G is applied, cations drift into the polymeric channel and reduce the hole concentration, and consequently, drain current I D is lowered. When a negative V G is applied, cations are removed from and anions drift into the polymeric channel, the hole concentration increases, and this results in a larger I D . In OECTs, ions can penetrate the bulk of the polymer and the volumetric nanoscale ionic-electronic charge compensation results in a large current modulation. This high gate voltage to drain current modulation yields a high transconductance, which is the hallmark of OECTs. Another key feature of OECTs is the dependence of I D on the ion concentration in the electrolyte. More precisely, the fixed charges in the ion-conducting phase of the polymeric channel are electrostatically compensated by the mobile ions provided by the electrolyte. This Donnan equilibrium results in a concentration-dependent voltage drop at the polymer/electrolyte interface, which is, in turn, mirrored by the OECT threshold voltage. As shown in Fig. 1d, ionic or polyatomic cations (anions) interact with PEDOT, a hole conductor, and PSS, an ionic conductor, and decrease (increase) the doping level of PEDOT, resulting in a decrease (increase) in I D and the OECT threshold voltage (Fig. 1d).

A detailed analysis of the OEND response with experimental and simulation data is shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and2. Consecutive V(I) or I(V) scans display highly reproducible responses of the OEND (Supplementary Fig. 3). The time response τ OEND of the OEND element for square-wave input pulses is τ OEND ≈ 11 ms (Supplementary Fig. 3). When the OEND is coupled to an RC element (Fig. 1b) forming an OAN, its response bifurcates, producing voltage or current oscillations (Fig. 2; load-line analysis is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4). These spike-based oscillations represent the 'action potentials' of the OAN (Supplementary Fig. 5). Figure 2b displays the current response I out of the OAN for different values of capacitor C. The firing frequency f fir can be finely tuned between 6 and 40 Hz by changing C, a range that is consistent with physiological levels of instantaneous firing rates in biological neurons 37 . The firing frequency range can be further extended by modifying C or by using high-frequency-response OECTs 38 . In the case of polymer-based capacitors, capacitances in the range of nanofarads to microfarads can be reached with micrometre-scale PEDOT:PSS-based capacitors 26 . The parametric oscillatory response in the I-V plane and the instantaneous power dissipation P inst of the OAN is shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. The instantaneous power dissipation is given by P inst = V in /R(V in - V out ), where V in , V out and I out refer to the input voltage, output voltage and output current of the whole OAN, respectively. The calculation includes all the OAN components (for example, transistors, resistors and capacitor). The mean power dissipation P mean = 143 μW.

        <p>The amplitude and window of the current or voltage oscillations can be precisely designed (Supplementary Fig. 8), for instance, by engineering the threshold voltage of transistors T 1 and T 2 . In this case, the oscillatory window is shifted to a lower voltage level when decreasing the threshold voltage of T 1 by doping PEDOT:PSS with the amine-based molecular dopant N-methyl-2,2′-diaminodiethylamine (ref. 39 ), and P mean is decreased from 143 to 24 μW. For a capacitor with C = 6 nF and by neglecting the static power dissipation, the energy consumption per spike is E spike = 57 nJ. The amplitude profile of the current oscillations can also be engineered by varying R 1 and R 2 of the OAN (the effect of R 1 and R 2 on the nonlinear properties of the OEND is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2). It should be noted that doping causes permanent threshold-voltage shifts and dynamic reconfigurability can be induced by introducing synaptic transistors instead of volatile ones. In the case of PEDOT:PSS, the threshold voltage can be tuned on the fly by changing the ion concentration 40 , a phenomenon that is exploited here to obtain an ion-concentration-dependent firing frequency. The OAN displays fully consistent stability when continuously operated at various amplitude and frequency conditions, as the firing response is practically unaffected for &gt;10 5 spiking cycles (Fig. 2d). The OAN stability as a function of the number of spikes is also evaluated. The amplitude of I out reduces by ~2.8 × 10 -5 % per spike. As a result, after 10 6 spikes, the OAN current amplitude is equal to approximately 71% of the initial amplitude.The amplitude and window of the current or voltage oscillations can be precisely designed (Supplementary Fig. 8), for instance, by engineering the threshold voltage of transistors T 1 and T 2 .

The OAN operates in a liquid, a property that is reminiscent of the extracellular environment of biological neurons in the cerebrospinal fluid.

The excitability of the OAN, that is, the tendency of a neuron to fire spikes, can be modulated by the presence of electrochemical oscillations transmitted by means of ionic fluxes in the electrolytic medium.

        <p>An increase of only a few millivolts at the potential of the electrolytic medium elicits spikes with high temporal precision (Supplementary Fig. 9), and a forced bursting activity is phase locked with the ionic signal in the electrolyte.

        <p>Due to its finite response time, the OAN displays a stimulusresponse delay (Fig. 3b), as well as behaves as a temporal integrator (Fig. 3c). The stimulus-response delay in biological neurons, known as spike latency, can provide a rapid and efficient neural coding scheme beyond simple rate coding, as latency can be a faster differentiator than the mean firing rates 44 . We further investigate this delay and reproduce the spike latency characteristic of biological neurons. Figure 3b shows that the stimulus-firing phase difference Δφ is modulated by the input voltage difference ΔV in (time-domain response is shown in Supplementary Fig. 11). Stronger stimulation induces shorter latencies, as observed in biological sensory systems 45 . Due to the finite and relatively slow time constant of biomembranes, biological neurons temporally integrate inputs and display firing under certain interstimulus timing conditions 46 . This integration lowers the timing precision and offers temporal buffering windows for ongoing neuronal inputs, ensuring the consolidation and stability of neuronal sequences 46 . Analogous to biological neurons, the OAN integrates time, buffers input stimuli and fires for short non-overlapping interstimulus intervals (Fig. 3c).Due to its finite response time, the OAN displays a stimulusresponse delay (Fig. 3b), as well as behaves as a temporal integrator (Fig. 3c).

        <p>Biological environments are characterized by seemingly random fluctuations at a range of spatiotemporal scales, and therefore, neurons are constantly operating under noisy conditions 47 . This noise couples with neuronal dynamics, influencing neuronal excitability and firing properties. Although counterintuitive, noise can be beneficial for neuronal communication and processing. For instance, noise can enable the transmission of weak subthreshold signals, smoothens subthreshold-to-threshold nonlinearities or even enhances the communication efficiency by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio or by altering the neuronal coding schemes 47 . The noise-induced activity of the OAN is presented in Fig. 3d. The OAN is biased with a d.c. input voltage at the subthreshold regime, and white noise of variable amplitude (V pp = 5-150 mV) is injected in the electrolytic medium to emulate extracellular noise/fluctuations. As the amplitude of the noise increases, a gradual transition from tonic (V pp = 0-25 mV) to irregular firing (V pp = 50 mV) is observed. For low noise levels, the frequency of tonic firing remains practically constant, that is, f fir ≅ 6.5-7.0 Hz. As the noise level increases, packets of spikes are observed. Recurrence plots of the interspike intervals and spike-to-spike amplitudes (Supplementary Fig. 12) indicate a change in the coding scheme from tonic to noise-induced bursting activity, as well as the resilience of spiking against noise in the electrolytic medium.Biological environments are characterized by seemingly random fluctuations at a range of spatiotemporal scales, and therefore, neurons are constantly operating under noisy conditions 47 .

        <p>It is estimated that the extracellular electrolytic space occupies a volume fraction of ~15-30% of the brain tissue. This extracellular space is an aqueous electrolyte comprising various ionic species (mostly Na + , K + , Cl -and Ca 2+ ) and represents a reservoir by maintaining homoeostatic balance of the ion concentrations under physiological conditions. In mammalian cells, the range of physiological concentrations for Na + is c ext = 130-150 mM and c int = 10-15 mM and for K + , c ext = 3-12 mM and c int = 150-160 mM, where c ext and c int are the https://doi.org/10.1038/s41928-022-00859-y extracellular and intracellular concentrations, respectively 48 .

        <p>The OAN, due to its in-liquid operation, exhibits firing properties that depend on the ionic concentration of the electrolyte host. As the electrolyte concentration increases, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte also increases; thus, T 1 (or T 2 ) has a lower response time and f fir increases 54 . Figure 4a shows the dependence of the firing waveform on the NaCl concentration (in an aqueous solution), c NaCl . Here f fir increases from 25 to &gt;50 Hz for c NaCl = 80-150 mM, a range that is on par with common physiological and pathological extracellular Na + concentrations (Fig. 4b). This results in a relative increase in the firing frequency of Δf fir /f min ≅ 110% and agrees with the behaviour of biological neurons in which f fir increases with the extracellular Na + concentration 55 . As further confirmation, Supplementary Fig. 13 shows that the OAN also operates under the common physiological/pathological range of extracellular K + concentrations in an aqueous solution, namely, c KCl = 5-50 mM; furthermore, in this case, f fir increases with the K + concentration.

        <p>Dopamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter that regulates essential brain functions including cognition, learning, motivation, motor control, mood regulation and addiction 57 . At the cellular level, dopamine can impact neuronal excitability in a multitude of ways (resulting in excitatory or inhibitory and time-and concentration-dependent https://doi.org/10.1038/s41928-022-00859-y effects), both via synaptic and non-synaptic activation of dopamine receptors 58 . For example, dopamine has a net excitatory effect on primate pyramidal neurons 59 . As shown in Fig. 4d, the presence of dopamine in the electrolyte increases the excitability of the OAN and initiates tonic firing.

The behaviour shown in Fig. 4d highlights that the initiation of spikes can be biochemically triggered, a property that resembles the biological neuronal signalling phenomena. It should be noted that the OAN also exhibits biorealistic diversity in signalling, as dopamine-mediated inhibition can be induced by altering the OAN biasing scheme (Supplementary Fig. 15).Dopamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter that regulates essential brain functions including cognition, learning, motivation, motor control, mood regulation and addiction 57 .

        <p>The OAN is capable of direct biointerfacing in a biologically relevant environment, and a biohybrid neuron is formed by incorporating a biomembrane between the gate and channel of T 1 (Fig. 5). The system consists of a biological and artificial compartment. As a relevant biomembrane model system, the prototypical epithelial cell line Caco-2, which is a model of the intestinal epithelial barrier and widely used for in vitro toxicology and drug delivery studies [65][66][67] , is incorporated with the OAN. The biomembrane comprises epithelial cells joined with tight junctions, thus forming a natural barrier for ion passage (Fig. 5a). The biohybrid neuron functions in situ and in real time (Fig. 5b). Initially, the OAN is operated in a plain cell culture medium; in the absence of the biomembrane barrier, electrochemical oscillations are sustained at f fir ≅ 12 Hz. A barrier functionality is induced with the incorporation of the biomembrane. This biomembrane barrier blocks the gate-to-channel ion passage and suppresses the oscillations of the biohybrid neuron, with f fir ≅ 0 Hz. The addition of a chemical agent that attacks the biomembrane's tight junctions-here the toxin hydrogen https://doi.org/10.1038/s41928-022-00859-y peroxide-lowers the barrier of ion passage and results in a gradual recovery of oscillations.

In the second photolithography step using the positive photoresist AZ 9260 MicroChemicals (Cipec Spécialités), the channel dimensions of T 1 and T 2 are defined. Reactive ion etching (O 2 /CF 4 plasma, 160 W for 16 min with O 2 flow rate of 50 s.c.c.m. and CHF 3 flow rate of 5 s.c.c.m.) was used to define the channels of T 1 and T 2 throughout the photoresist mask. The channel of T 1 is made with the organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor polymer PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000) mixed with 5.0 wt% ethylene glycol, 0.1 wt% dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and 1.0 wt% (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane. The film was spin coated in two steps at 1,500 rpm and 650 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 120 °C for 1 min in between. The devices were subsequently baked at 140 °C for 1 hour. For the implementation of T 2 , the semiconducting polymer p(g2T-TT) was synthesized according to another work 36 . Here p(g2T-TT) was dissolved in chloroform (3 mg ml -1 ) inside a N 2 -filled glovebox and spin coated in ambient conditions at 1,000 rpm for 1 min resulting in a thickness of 40 nm. The devices were baked at 60 °C for 1 min. The sacrificial upper parylene C layer was peeled off to confine the polymer to the inside of the channel regions. Excess soap was rinsed off with deionized water. A schematic of the OAN is shown in Supplementary Fig. 19.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41928-022-00859-y gold electrodes. A promoter (Silane A-174 (γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane), Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the lower parylene C layer to enhance adhesion. In the second photolithography step using the positive photoresist AZ 9260 MicroChemicals (Cipec Spécialités), the channel dimensions of T 1 and T 2 are defined. Reactive ion etching (O 2 /CF 4 plasma, 160 W for 16 min with O 2 flow rate of 50 s.c.c.m. and CHF 3 flow rate of 5 s.c.c.m.) was used to define the channels of T 1 and T 2 throughout the photoresist mask. The channel of T 1 is made with the organic mixed ionic-electronic conductor polymer PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000) mixed with 5.0 wt% ethylene glycol, 0.1 wt% dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and 1.0 wt% (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane. The film was spin coated in two steps at 1,500 rpm and 650 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 120 °C for 1 min in between. The devices were subsequently baked at 140 °C for 1 hour. For the implementation of T 2 , the semiconducting polymer p(g2T-TT) was synthesized according to another work 36 . Here p(g2T-TT) was dissolved in chloroform (3 mg ml -1 ) inside a N 2 -filled glovebox and spin coated in ambient conditions at 1,000 rpm for 1 min resulting in a thickness of 40 nm. The devices were baked at 60 °C for 1 min. The sacrificial upper parylene C layer was peeled off to confine the polymer to the inside of the channel regions. Excess soap was rinsed off with deionized water. A schematic of the OAN is shown in Supplementary Fig. 19.</p>
        <p>The current versus voltage characteristics of the individual OECTs and OENDs were obtained using a Keithley 2400 semiconductor parameter analyser. Ag/AgCl were used as the gate electrodes with 100 mM NaCl electrolyte solution, unless otherwise stated. The nonlinear characteristics of the OENDs were obtained by enforcing current when the corresponding voltage was measured or by enforcing voltage when the corresponding current was measured. The OEND was coupled with RC and V in elements (external components) to complete the OAN, which exhibits neuronal dynamics when connected to voltage source V in (Fig. 1b). The voltage oscillation was directly recorded at the V out terminal using an Agilent infiniiVision digital oscilloscope. The output current I out of the OEND is measured by measuring the voltage V 0 across resistor R M with a differential amplifier (based on an INA122 integrated circuit) and a digital oscilloscope (Supplementary Fig. 20). To characterize the OAN response in the presence of different electrobiochemical signals, a Tektronix AFG1022 arbitrary function generator was used for the input voltage. The arbitrary function generator and semiconductor parameter analyser were used together to generate an arbitrary noise signal for the noise-induced neuronal characterization, phase-locking measurements and characterization of the various neuromorphic behaviours. The spectrogram of the short-time Fourier transform was performed using
