        <p>. Mean ARAT scores (and standard errors) for each group at baseline, 6month, 12month, pretreatment, and post-treatment assessments, shown at the average time at which the assessments occurred for the group. Baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments occurred at approximately the same time after stroke for all groups. The control group underwent assessments only at these three timepoints. However, because the groups differed in when their intervention was administered, each group underwent their pre-and post-intervention assessments at different time-points during the study period. Baseline and pre-intervention assessment were the same for the acute group; pre-intervention and 6-month assessment were the same for the chronic group. The mean ARAT scores (and standard errors) are plotted at the study group's average day of assessment at each time-point.</p>
