        <p>A multitude of chemical, biological, and material systems present an inductive behavior that is not electromagnetic in origin. Here, it is termed a chemical inductor. We show that the structure of the chemical inductor consists of a twodimensional system that couples a fast conduction mode and a slowing down element. Therefore, it is generally defined in dynamical terms rather than by a specific physicochemical mechanism. The chemical inductor produces many familiar features in electrochemical reactions, including catalytic, electrodeposition, and corrosion reactions in batteries and fuel cells, and in solid-state semiconductor devices such as solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, and memristors. It generates the widespread phenomenon of negative capacitance, it causes negative spikes in voltage transient measurements, and it creates inverted hysteresis effects in current-voltage curves and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, it determines stability, bifurcations, and chaotic properties associated to selfsustained oscillations in biological neurons and electrochemical systems. As these properties emerge in different types of measurement techniques such as impedance spectroscopy and time-transient decays, the chemical inductor becomes a useful framework for the interpretation of the electrical, optoelectronic, and electrochemical responses in a wide variety of systems. In the paper, we describe the general dynamical structure of the chemical inductor and we comment on a broad range of examples from different research areas.A multitude of chemical, biological, and material systems present an inductive behavior that is not electromagnetic in origin.

We use the methods of equivalent circuits to represent impedance spectroscopy data and obtain an interpretation of the system. 8,10,11 An important feature of the practical analysis of impedance spectroscopy is that the circuit elements change exponentially with the voltage. Hence a variety of spectra are possible in a single system, according to the evolution of the individual elements.

The combination of the two techniques allows us to conclude that dissolution of Mg 2+ ions is the slow and limiting step in this electrochemical reaction and must be the slow process of eqs 3 and 4. Indeed, during the frequency sweep at frequencies below 1 Hz, the voltage excitation becomes slow enough to enable all Mg 2+ ions to depart from reactive centers, leading to the formation of the inductor. Of course, the kinetics of dissolution could be modified if conditions are such that they are no longer mass-transport limited. For example, by using efficient stirring or by sonication of the reactive surface. Overall, the presented model in this work could be applied to obtain accurate kinetic information about the corrosion process.

This dynamical model is more complex than that of eqs 3 and 4 as it contains a four-dimensional structure associated with the voltage and three recovery variables termed [n, m, and h] that determine the voltage-dependent conductances of sodium and potassium ion channels.

However, whenever the small ac impedance of the HH model is calculated, 2,55,96-100 a circuit of the classes of Figure 1b-d appears, and this is because HH contains the mechanism of the chemical inductor. Early measurements of the neuron impedance are shown in Figure 3, providing a clear instance of the chemical inductor in an oscillating system.</p>
        <p>In fact, a complete analysis of the small ac equivalent circuit of HH, 12 first presented by Cole (p 299), 100 shows that the potassium channel presents the structure of Figure 1b, see Figure 15b, while the sodium channel contains two chemical inductor branches so that the equivalent circuit contains a total of three inductive branches corresponding to the mentioned recovery variables. The results in Figure 15 of a calculation of impedance responses as the membrane voltage is varied from the resting state show different impedance patterns: in c and d, the impedance of Figure 6a is shown both for sodium and potassium channels. While the potassium channel does not contain a negative resistance, the hidden negative resistance of Figure 8a occurs in a narrow voltage range in Figure 15c for the sodium channel. Here arise the self-sustained oscillations of the giant axon. Furthermore, the sodium channel shows the phenomenon of the negative inductor. 12 The inductive behavior of non-magnetic origin in the squid giant axon was well recognized before 1940 by Cole, based on impedance spectroscopy measurement as in Figure 3, 2 but a reasonable interpretation was not obtained. He later remarked that "the suggestion of an inductive reactance anywhere in the system was shocking to the point of being unbelievable." 100 Hodgkin and Huxley 3 proposed that the potassium conductance is proportional to the power of a variable that obeys a first-order equation in order to match the very different transient curves: the delayed increase in depolarization but a simple exponential decay in repolarization. Thus, as explained later by Hodgkin, 101 "the inductance is mainly due to the delayed increase in potassium conductance, which can make the membrane current lag behind voltage, provided the internal potential is positive to the potassium equilibrium potential." This is a clear early formulation of a chemical inductor mechanism.In fact, a complete analysis of the small ac equivalent circuit of HH, 12 first presented by Cole (p 299), 100 shows that the potassium channel presents the structure of Figure 1b, see Figure 15b, while the sodium channel contains two chemical inductor branches so that the equivalent circuit contains a total of three inductive branches corresponding to the mentioned recovery variables.

        <p>Since the HH model shows a great deal of complexity, simpler models are used that describe well the properties of neural dynamics with a reduced number of adaptative parameters. The minimal structure that generates action potentials is described by a two-dimensional model as shown in eqs 3 and 4. 6,102 An example of the properties of the FHN model has been described in detail in Section 2.1.2.Since the HH model shows a great deal of complexity, simpler models are used that describe well the properties of neural dynamics with a reduced number of adaptative parameters.

        <p>We found a common structure in electrochemical, biological, and semiconductor systems in which a fast conduction mode contains a slow channel with time-dependent dynamics. This structure leads to a generic circuit that contains a capacitance and a resistor, and the slow mode gives an inductance that is termed a chemical inductor. When negative elements such as a negative differential resistance come into play, this dynamical model can be generalized to a self-sustained oscillating system under an externally fixed voltage or current. The transition from rest to periodic spiking occurs at a Hopf bifurcation. The experimental analysis of the impedance spectra enables us to recognize the dynamical properties of such systems.We found a common structure in electrochemical, biological, and semiconductor systems in which a fast conduction mode contains a slow channel with time-dependent dynamics.
