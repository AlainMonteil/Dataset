        <p>Background For safety assessment in clinical trials, adverse events (AEs) are reported for the drug under evaluation and compared with AEs in the placebo group. Little is known about the nature of the AEs associated with clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the extent to which these can be traced to nocebo effects, where negative treatmentrelated expectations favor their occurrence.Background For safety assessment in clinical trials, adverse events (AEs) are reported for the drug under evaluation and compared with AEs in the placebo group.

        <p>Findings Relative risks showed that the occurrence of AEs reported in the vaccine groups was higher compared with the placebo groups. The most frequently AEs in both groups were fatigue, headache, local pain, as injection site reactions, and myalgia. In particular, for first doses in placebo recipients, fatigue was reported in 29% and 27% in BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 groups, respectively, and in 21% of Ad26.COV2.S participants. Headache was reported in 27% in both mRNA groups and in 24% of Ad26.COV2.S recipients. Myalgia was reported in 10% and 14% in mRNA groups (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively) and in 13% of Ad26.COV2.S participants. Local pain was reported in 12% and 17% in mRNA groups (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively), and in 17% of Ad26.COV2.S recipients. These AEs are more common in the younger population and in the first dose of placebo recipients of the mRNA vaccines.Findings Relative risks showed that the occurrence of AEs reported in the vaccine groups was higher compared with the placebo groups.

        <p>Adverse events (AEs) of drugs are a central feature of the information that goes into clinical treatment decisions. It is known that by analyzing safety outcomes in placebo groups, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) provide a perspective for understanding the role of negative expectations in treatment outcomesthe nocebo effect, originally introduced to describe the negative effects of a placebo treatment. 1 Different contextual and patients related factors leading to nocebo effects have been identified. 2,3 Placebo groups from RCTs provide the data to analyze nocebo effects in terms of the occurrence of adverse reactions and treatment non-adherence in term of drop out. In a RCT, subjects know that they can receive either the active drug or the placebo and, accordingly, they are informed about the AEs they may experience. This can have a significant impact on the experience of associated discomfort. Indeed, drugs that produce more AEs cause highest symptomatic effects, even in the placebo groups, [4][5][6][7][8] and consequently higher dropout rates due to a negative treatment outcome. Significantly, Benedetti et al. 9 have recently demonstrated an involvement of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity and state anxiety in AEs reporting after placebo administration.Adverse events (AEs) of drugs are a central feature of the information that goes into clinical treatment decisions.

        <p>AEs may also be related to disease symptoms as reported for immunization with non-live vaccines. This highlights that symptoms are not always caused by the vaccine, but may be due to negative expectations and linked to nocebo risks. 10 The reason why these AEs occur is unclear, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is an ongoing challenge.AEs may also be related to disease symptoms as reported for immunization with non-live vaccines.

        <p>Little is known about the nature of the AEs associated with clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the extent to which these are nocebo effects, where negative treatment-related expectations favor their occurrence. To bridge this gap, our study aims to analyze the phase III safety data of vaccines approved to date with respect to the solicited AE profiles in the active and placebo groups. We found that AEs such as fatigue, headache, and pain (as local injection site reaction and myalgia) were the most commonly reported in both the active drug and the placebo arms, although in active vaccine arms they were higher.Little is known about the nature of the AEs associated with clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the extent to which these are nocebo effects, where negative treatment-related expectations favor their occurrence.

Considering participants aged 18-54 years, fatigue and headache were reported more in the placebo groups combined with BNT162b2. Interestingly, in the vaccine recipients local pain was the most reported symptom, as injection site reaction, with a higher representation in the younger subjects (for the mRNA vaccines with a C.I. between 0¢7-0¢9, and for the viral vector type vaccine between 0¢3-0¢6). However, in the placebo recipients, this specific AE was reported in the same C.I., between 0¢1-0¢2, in the two age groups and for all three vaccines. The systemic side effect of myalgia/muscle pain was reported in vaccine recipients in a C.I. between 0¢1 and 0¢4, with a higher representation for younger subjects in the three groups, and considering placebo recipients between 0¢1-0¢2 for the two age groups (Fig. 2).After the first dose, a significant increase of fatigue and headache was observed in younger subjects in the placebo groups of the mRNA vaccines (CI: 0¢3 to 0¢4) in comparison to the older groups. In contrast, the percentage of these adverse events (fatigue and headache) in the younger and older recipients was similar for placebo group of the viral vector type vaccine. Considering participants aged 18-54 years, fatigue and headache were reported more in the placebo groups combined with BNT162b2.

        <p>Finally, as shown in table 3, the percentage (95% CI) with AEs was less after the second dose of placebo. Specifically, among the systemic reactions, fatigue, headache, and myalgia/muscle pain were observed to a lesser extent after the second doses of placebo in comparison to the first doses. Particularly, fatigue decreased from 29% to 20% in the BNT162b2-associated group, and from 27% to 23% in mRNA-1273-associated group.Finally, as shown in table 3, the percentage (95% CI) with AEs was less after the second dose of placebo.

        <p>Unsolicited AEs were more common in the vaccine groups than in the placebo groups (BNT162b2: 27% vs 12%; mRNA-1273: 22% vs 19%; Ad26.COV2.S: 13% vs 12%). SAEs observed in the active and placebo groups of the three different vaccines occurred at a similar rate. Particularly, any type of SAEs was reported in less than 1% of both vaccine and placebo groups for all the trials (BNT162b2: 0¢6% vs 0¢5%; mRNA-1273: 0¢5% vs 0¢6%; Ad26.COV2.S: 0.4% in both vaccine and placebo groups).

        <p>We found that the solicited AEs profile in the placebo arms of the studies is comparable to those of the vaccine with which placebo was compared, although the percentage was higher with vaccine (as shown in table 4).

        <p>Among the systemic reactions, fatigue, headache, and myalgia/muscle pain were observed to a lesser extent after the second doses of placebo, in comparison to the first doses. Conversely, in the vaccine groups, we observed an increase of almost all AEs following the second dose, with the exception of local pain. Interestingly, younger participants showed higher reporting of fatigue and headache both in the placebo groups of the mRNA vaccines and after the first doses. Considering the total subset of participants, systemic reactions of fatigue, headache, and myalgia decreased substantially from the first to the second dose of placebo combined with the mRNA vaccines (with the exception of local pain for mRNA-1273, as injection site reaction).

        <p>We have considered AEs categorized in the ascertainment strategy as structured recording, where symptoms were collected using a checklist or diary cards. In particular, solicited AEs were recorded using electronic diaries, through the assessment of systematic reactions and local injection site symptoms. The recording of solicited AEs, assessed in the placebo recipients after the first doses, and included in a checklist, instead of spontaneous reports or unsolicited symptoms, allowed us to analyze the role of negative expectations in treatment outcomes. In addition, the results of the second doses of vaccines and placebos allowed us to investigate aspects not only related to the negative expectations associated with a new treatment, but also in terms of learning from previous experience, as a conditioning phenomenon.We have considered AEs categorized in the ascertainment strategy as structured recording, where symptoms were collected using a checklist or diary cards.

        <p>Non-pharmacodynamic factors, such as expectation alone, analyzed in the placebo groups of the considered trials after the first treatment dose, may have triggered distressing symptoms-as an effect of the nocebo phenomenon. 1,17 Self-fulfilling prophecy is a phenomenon whereby the belief that a future event will occur contributes to the actual occurrence of that adverse reaction. It plays a crucial role in modelling experiences and can be considered causal, rather than simply predictive. 18,19 Such beliefs, as response expectations, can influence health outcomes, 19,20 as previously seen in allergology, in the treatment of muscle tension, for gastrointestinal disorders, and erectile dysfunction, in asthmatic patients and during generic substitution. [21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29] This phenomenon may be particularly relevant during the current state of pandemic emergency and when testing new vaccines. 30,31 Furthermore, it has been observed that the reporting of AEs was more common in patients with negative expectations when taking a new drug. 32 Fear and anxiety of experiencing adverse reactions due to the treatment may be increased. These observations are in line with what has been previously reported with respect to non-live vaccines, as symptoms occurring after immunization are not always caused by the vaccine itself, but may be due to negative expectation and linked to nocebo risks. 10 These concerns may have an impact on the proportion of AEs reported in RCTs.In several studies of rituximab administration for rheumatoid arthritis, the proportion of AEs decreased by 50% with subsequent doses, and this result, (without pharmacological explanation), could be related to decreased anxiety in participants. [33][34][35] This is in line with what we observed for systemic reactions, such as fatigue and headache in placebo recipients of the new mRNA vaccines. These two systemic reactions were the most represented solicited symptoms in placebo recipients and decreased after the second dose (with a decrease also observed for myalgia). Notably, these symptoms often occur in healthy people who do not take medication. 36 In their study, considering different clinical conditions, Howick and colleagues 37 found that headache, fatigue and myalgia were among the most frequently reported systemic AEs in the placebo groups of the analyzed RCTs. It is interesting to note that in the vaccine recipients at the first doses, the most reported AE was local pain, while in the placebo recipients the more represented AEs were systemic reactions, such as fatigue and headache. Moreover, considering the second doses, the systemic AEs decreased in placebo recipients, while all the solicited AEs increased in the vaccine groups. Such aspect may be influenced by several factors, including conditioning. Significantly, our results seem to suggest a role for nocebo in systemic adverse reactions, as mild symptoms, most of which are not vaccine related.Non-pharmacodynamic factors, such as expectation alone, analyzed in the placebo groups of the considered trials after the first treatment dose, may have triggered distressing symptoms-as an effect of the nocebo phenomenon. 1,17 Self-fulfilling prophecy is a phenomenon whereby the belief that a future event will occur contributes to the actual occurrence of that adverse reaction.

        <p>Data from our study support the hypothesis that a substantial proportion of the AEs of COVID-19 vaccines may be related to nocebo effects. The fairly high proportions of placebo and vaccine recipients who have experienced AEs, and the adverse reactions observed, may suggest prevention strategies to promote a possible greater adherence to the vaccination campaign. The media and health professionals could potentially reduce these side effects through positive framing and by raising awareness of the nocebo effect. Unfortunately, the presence of the current infodemic risk, 38 in which negative information related to clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines, may lead to an escalation in the occurrence of AEs. 30,31,39 The Internet as a source of medical information could lead to limited trust in new treatments. Indeed, negative publicity of statin-induced myalgia has led to high rates of statin discontinuation, use of second-line agents, and increased rates of cardiovascular events among participants of an RCT of the statin atorvastatin in the non-blind extension phase. 40 On the other hand, and more recommended as a way of proceeding, as it was suggested by Barnes et al., 41 the empirical studies that analyzed positive framing emphasized how it is a promising strategy to reduce nocebo effects. However, they also revealed some important open questions, including the best method of communicating AEs, the optimal statistical presentation, whether framing affects the perceived absolute risk of side effects, and what psychological mechanisms underlie framing effects. The authors pointed out that future research will be vital in understanding the circumstances in which framing is most likely to be effective. 41 In particular, awareness of the nocebo effect may lead to a greater participation in the COVID-19 immunization and to a greater protection from infection. 29 Significantly, pointing out that the anticipation or fear of an adverse reaction can become a self-fulfilling prophecy (by causing the misattribution of unrelated, pre-existing symptoms to the drug being evaluated) may in itself help to obviate the presentation of adverse reactions. It may also be helpful to discuss the nocebo phenomenon explicitly at the time of trial recruitment and to explain how somatic symptoms caused by pre-existing medical illnesses, or by anxiety, can be misattributed to an active medication. In particular, strategies to minimize nocebo-related risks and to improve adherence to vaccine inoculation should be considered and discussed to possibly modify negative expectations associated with a new treatment. Positive framing has previously been shown to be an effective strategy to prevent AEs in the influenza vaccination campaign. 42,43 It would be useful to focus on benefits rather than negative effects, e.g. by highlighting the proportion of patients who usually tolerate the treatment well, without experiencing particular side effects. Significantly, it would be also crucial to emphasize how the levels of occurrence of SAEs in the analyzed trials were similar in vaccine and placebo recipients, and how they were defined by the authors as unrelated to vaccination and in line with the expected background rate in the general population. [14][15][16] Our study leads to the important hypothesis that phase III trials of COVID-19 vaccines could cause the nocebo effect and alter their safety outcomes. The emergency authorization of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines also may lead the population to fear and anxiety about the safety of these new drugs, triggering negative expectations associated with immunization.Data from our study support the hypothesis that a substantial proportion of the AEs of COVID-19 vaccines may be related to nocebo effects.

        <p>The limitation of this study is that the data are taken from published articles with information provided in a summary format and individual patient data were not available. In addition, the data obtained from the studies represent a further criticality due to the short duration of the phase III safety follow-up. The evaluation of longterm safety studies cannot be done in the context of maintaining a placebo group for the planned follow-up period of two years after the second dose. This makes the generalization of the results to the general population more uncertain. Furthermore, as we considered 10 clinical trials in three selected studies, we could not perform a meta-analysis. Future studies should consider and deeply explore the role played by nocebo effects in order to improve patients' adherence to these lifesaving therapies.The limitation of this study is that the data are taken from published articles with information provided in a summary format and individual patient data were not available.
