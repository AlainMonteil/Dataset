        <p>Changes over 50 years of research on antipsychotics in schizophrenia have occurred. A scientometric synthesis of such changes over time and a measure of researchers' networks and scientific productivity is currently lacking. We searched Web of Science Core Collection from inception until November 5, 2021, using the appropriate key. Our primary objective was to conduct systematic mapping with 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> to show how clusters of keywords have evolved over time and obtain clusters' structure and credibility. Our secondary objective was to measure research network performance (countries, institutions, and authors) using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix. We included 32,240 studies published between 1955 and 2021. The co-cited reference network identified 25 clusters with a well-structured network (Q=0.8166) and highly credible clustering (S=0.91). The main trends of research were: 1) antipsychotic efficacy; 2) cognition in schizophrenia; 3) side effects of antipsychotics. Last five years research trends were: 'ultra-resistance schizophrenia' (S=0.925), 'efficacy/dose-response' (S=0.775), 'evidencesynthesis' (S=0.737), 'real-world effectiveness' (S=0.794), 'cannabidiol' (S=0.989), and 'gut microbiome' (S=0.842). These results can inform funding agencies and research groups' future directions.

        <p>Antipsychotic medications are considered the first-line gold standard treatment for schizophrenia (Kahn et al., 2015). First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) were discovered in the 1950 s, and they possess prevalent dopamine receptor antagonist activity along with histamine and cholinergic receptor antagonism. FGAs were initially developed to treat positive symptoms of psychosis, and they have also been proven to be effective in the treatment of other conditions, such as agitation and acute mania (Antipsychotic medications are considered the first-line gold standard treatment for schizophrenia (Kahn et al., 2015).

        <p>FGAs are associated with a high rate of side effects, such as extrapyramidal side effects, including rigidity, bradykinesia, dystonia, tremor, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia (Carbon et al., 2018;Huhn et al., 2019;Rummel-Kluge et al., 2012), and hyperprolactinemia (Taipale et al., 2021). Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) were introduced in the 1980 s and are dopamine-serotonin antagonists, mainly because of their high affinity for 5-HT2A receptors (Correll, 2010). SGAs gained popularity over FGAs thanks to a lower risk of neurological and cognitive side effects; however, specific side effects of SGAs were also uncovered, including cardiometabolic side effects such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia (Galling et al., 2016;Pillinger et al., 2020). More recently, "third-generation" antipsychotics (TGAs) have been developed. They mostly act as serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (partial agonists), overall with fewer side effects than FGAs and SGAs (Amato et al., 2018;Kishi et al., 2020;Sabe et al., 2021).FGAs are associated with a high rate of side effects, such as extrapyramidal side effects, including rigidity, bradykinesia, dystonia, tremor, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia (Carbon et al., 2018;Huhn et al., 2019;Rummel-Kluge et al., 2012), and hyperprolactinemia (Taipale et al., 2021).

        <p>Over the years, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, umbrella reviews, and practice guidelines have offered a deep synthesis of specific research questions in psychiatry, and hundreds of publications have discussed the topic of antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia (Galderisi et al., 2021;Lobo et al., 2022;Radua et al., 2012;Solmi et al., 2020).Over the years, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, umbrella reviews, and practice guidelines have offered a deep synthesis of specific research questions in psychiatry, and hundreds of publications have discussed the topic of antipsychotics for patients with schizophrenia (Galderisi et al., 2021;Lobo et al., 2022;Radua et al., 2012;Solmi et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Such a significant growth in the literature requires new approaches to review and analyze trends within knowledge domains (Chen, 2006a;van Eck and Waltman, 2010). Nakagawa and colleagues recently proposed a new framework for research synthesis of both evidence and influence, named research weaving (Nakagawa et al., 2019). This framework combines systematic mapping and bibliometric analysis to inform the development of a field, the influence of research papers and their interconnections, and to visualize content across and within publications. Systematic mapping allows one to visualize and map the evolution of research over time, while bibliometric analyses measure how evidence is interconnected and the influence of authors via two different methods, namely performance analysis and bibliometric mapping (Nakagawa et al., 2019). This combination of systematic mapping and bibliometric analyses, that can be defined scientometric analysis, by providing a broad synthesis of a research field and how it has changed over time not only helps researchers and clinicians to have a clearer overview of the research on a given topic but also, can identify research abundancies, gaps, and trends, as well as visualization of potential moderators (e.g., publication year and methodological differences), bias, or limitations. Scientometric analyses can be relevant in psychiatry, and in psychopharmacology in particular, given the notable changes in profile of available medications, their efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and the evolution of sources of evidence on antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia. Although bibliometric studies examining publication trends in the field of antipsychotics and schizophrenia have previously been published for individual countries, to our knowledge, no scientometric study has been conducted to date.Such a significant growth in the literature requires new approaches to review and analyze trends within knowledge domains (Chen, 2006a;van Eck and Waltman, 2010).

        <p>We searched the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) as the most comprehensive database for scientometric analyses (Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2016). Our search terms combined Medical Subject Headings words and keywords such as 'schizophrenia' and 'antipsychotic* '. The full search terms are available in the study protocol (Supplementary information 1). The database source was limited to Science Citation Index Expanded, publication types to 'article' or 'review', with no limitation of language/time. The full records with cited references published until November 5, 2021, were extracted form WOSCC into in tag-delimited plain text files. Duplicates were eliminated with

        <p>Networks used in science mapping include directed and undirected graphs. Direct citation networks are directed graphs, whereas cocitation and co-occurrence networks are undirected graphs. A comparative study of direct citation and co-citation networks can be found in (Boyack and Klavans, 2010). Bibliometric outcomes included citation counts, co-citations and co-occurrences (Boyack and Klavans, 2010). Citation count are the number of citations to a publication, and co-citation count is defined as the frequency with which two published articles are cited together by subsequently published articles (Small, 1973). A co-citation network is particularly suitable for systematic reviews because co-citation linkages may reveal how groupings continuously evolve independently from original publications. Co-occurrence networks are a graphical representation of how frequently variables appear together. Systematic mapping outcomes were networks and co-citations (or co-occurrence) clusters. The interpretation of these clusters is augmented by 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs>'s automatic cluster labeling and summarization (Chen et al., 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> produces a variety of metrics of significance, with temporal metrics such as citation burstness, structural metrics such as betweenness centrality, modularity, and silhouette score as well as a combination of both, namely, the sigma metric. Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node (e.g., one article, one author) lies on the shortest path between other nodes based on Freeman's betweenness centrality metric (Freeman, 1977). Nodes with high betweenness centrality generally connect different clusters and are considered key hubs. Burstness measures the rate of change. The burstness of the frequency of an entity over time indicates a specific duration when an abrupt change in the frequency takes place, thus identifying emergent terms (Kleinberg, 2003). 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> also combines betweenness centrality as a structural property with citation burstness as a temporal property using a metric called sigma. Sigma is computed as (centrality +1) burstness (Chen et al., 2010) with higher values indicating works with higher influential potential. The modularity (the Q score) of a network measures the extent to which a network can be divided into modules or clusters, and the silhouette (the S score) is a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data (Shibata et al., 2008). The Q metric ranges from 0 to + 1, and the S metric ranges from -1 to + 1. For both metrics, a score close to + 1 represents the best clustering model. When the Q value is greater than 0.3, the cluster structure is considered significant, and higher values may indicate a well-structured network; when the silhouette coefficients exceed 0.3, 0.5, or 0.7, the network is considered homogenous, reasonable, or highly credible, respectively. A silhouette score of 1 may, however, indicate that the corresponding cluster is relatively isolated.

        <p>The cluster labels are generated from noun phrases of the keyword lists of articles cited in each cluster using the likelihood ratio test (p &lt; 0.001). Each cluster was closely inspected, and automatic labels were re-labelled according to authors' expertise, if needed.The cluster labels are generated from noun phrases of the keyword lists of articles cited in each cluster using the likelihood ratio test (p &lt; 0.001).

        <p>When examining the burstness of published articles, which indicates that a particular article is associated with a surge of citations, we excluded from the model the reference referring to describing and classifying mental disorders (e.g., DSM, ICD-10). Where appropriate, we merged redundant nodes (e.g., nodes for the author Kane J and Kane JM). The impact factors of the included journals were retrieved from the 2021 Journal Citation Reports (data were extracted from WOSCC in plain text files).When examining the burstness of published articles, which indicates that a particular article is associated with a surge of citations, we excluded from the model the reference referring to describing and classifying mental disorders (e.g., DSM, ICD-10).

Burst analyses were conducted with 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> for all units of measure. The g-index, an author-level metric based on the distribution of citations received that alleviates bias from highly cited papers as seen with the h-index, was used for all calculations (Egghe, 2006). Of importance, the inflated values of the g-Index help to give credit to lowly-cited or non-cited papers while giving credit for highly-cited papers, making g-index most relevant for co-cited analysis.

        <p>We generated a map of reference co-citations with corresponding clusters that permits the extraction of landmark references and clusters of research (Fig. 1A.B).

        <p>We identified 25 different clusters in this network of co-citation references with significant modularity and silhouette scores indicating highly credible clusters (Q=0.8166; S=0.91). Details of the extracted clusters are available in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1. Three different major trends of research regrouped in a single constellation were found. The first and most important trend concerned antipsychotic efficacy and started in [1980][1981][1982][1983][1984][1985][1986][1987][1988][1989][1990] with two research clusters. These clusters, with indication of the label, size, silhouette score, the average year of publication of the cluster members and most representative reference were: clusters #14 ('animal models ';142; S=0.995; 1979) (Carlsson, 1978) and #20 ('first-generation antipsychotics ';22;S=0.997;1986)(McCreadie et al., 1985)). These clusters shared hotspots with cluster #10 ('dopamine hypothesis '; 193; S=0.888; 1990) (Davis et al., 1991), which further evolved into clusters #0 ('RCT'; 388; S=0.837; 1993) (Chouinard et al., 1993), #2 ('second-generation antipsychotics'; 306; S=0.874; 1997) (Marder and Meibach, 1994) and #11 ('third-generation antipsychotics'; 173; S=0.899; 2002) (Potkin et al., 2003). This single research trend describes the evolution from research on first-, to second-and third-generation antipsychotics, which further branch into 6 different clusters: #5 ('compliance/remission'; 251; S=0.911; 2004) (Lieberman et al., 2005), #16 ('polypharmacy';115;S=0.936;2007) (Buchanan et al., 2010), #12 ('evidence-based psychiatry';155;S=0.936;2011) (Leucht et al., 2013), #8 ('long-acting antipsychotics';233;S=0.926;2013) (Tiihonen et al., 2011) and #3 ('treatment-resistant schizophrenia';306;S=0.877;2016) (Howes et al., 2017) (Supplementary Table 1).We identified 25 different clusters in this network of co-citation references with significant modularity and silhouette scores indicating highly credible clusters (Q=0.8166; S=0.91).

        <p>The second major trend of research concerns cognition in schizophrenia. It starts with research on nicotine with cluster #25 ('nicotine '; 6; S=0.998; 1993) (Goff et al., 1992), which develops research on the cognitive deficit with cluster #21 ('latent inhibition'; 21; S=0.998; 1994) (Gray et al., 1995), #7 ('neuropsychology';235;S=0.882;1993) (Meltzer and McGurk, 1999) and#9 ('sensorimotor gating deficits'; 202; S=0.928; 1998) (Arnt and Skarsfeldt, 1998). More recently, these clusters became cluster #6 ('cognition'; 238; S=0.872; 2005) (Keefe et al., 2007), with strong links to cluster #11 third-generation antipsychotics that have fewer impacts on cognitive functioning than less recent antipsychotics.The second major trend of research concerns cognition in schizophrenia.

        <p>The third major research trend concerns the side effects of antipsychotics. These trends begin in 2000, with the first cluster on antipsychotic-induced weight gain, cluster #13 ('diabetes mellitus'; 144; S=0.946; 2000) (Allison et al., 1999), which evolved into cluster #4 ('metabolic syndrome'; 279; S=0.867; 2007)(ADA, 2004) and has currently evolved into cluster #15 with evidence synthesis and prediction of risks ('evidence synthesis/obesity'; 137; S=0.928; 2015) Vancampfort et al., 2015).The third major research trend concerns the side effects of antipsychotics.

        <p>Furthermore, three relatively independent trends of research were also found: one on antipsychotics for bipolar disorders #19 ('bipolar disorder '; 52; S=0.985; 1995) (Tohen et al., 1999), one on genetics #17 ('pharmacogenetics'; 71; S=0.957; 2000) (Arranz and de Leon, 2007), and one on inflammation #1 ('inflammation'; 336; S=0.889; 2012) Fig. 3.

            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs>. Note: (A) The visualization map of the collaborative country network (based on co-authors' countries) reveals the influence of each node. The network is organized by betweenness centrality, and centrality scores are normalized to the unit interval of [0,1]. A node of high betweenness centrality is usually one that connects two or more large groups of nodes. A node with a strong betweenness centrality score has a great influence on a network. High betweenness centrality is represented by the thickness of a purple trim. The nodes were limited to the top 50 countries. Burstness of citation is revealed with the presence of red tree rings. The thicker the red tree rings, the more burstness for the corresponding node. (B) Visualization map of the network of co-author institutions, according to the degree of citations. Annual citations of each institution are rendered as citation tree rings. The most recent citations correspond to the innermost rings. Nodes with outermost rings in purple are identified as hotspots. The color of a link represents the earliest time slice in which the connection was first made. (C) Network of co-author institutions with representation of identified clusters.

        <p>To further examine research trends, we focused on the last five years co-citations reference network (2016-2021) and on each month of the last available year (2021) (Supplementary Figs. 456). For both networks, the modularity score was significant, and the silhouette suggested highly credible clusters (Q=0.6912; S=0.8774 and Q=0.536; S=0.8186, respectively). The two corresponding networks reveal the latest evolution of three major research trends that were previously identified: 'treatment-resistant schizophrenia' (Fig. 1) became a cluster with numerous neuroimaging studies #3 ('glutamate'; 95; S=0.822; 2016) (Howes et al., 2015) (Supplementary Fig. 4), and in 2021, that further evolved into cluster #7 ('ultra-treatment resistance'; 65; S=0.925; 2017) (Campana et al., 2021) and #5 ('efficacy/dose-response'; 81; S=0.925; 2017) (Galling et al., 2017). The 'long-acting injectable' became cluster #2 ('real-world evidence'; 111; S=0.923; 2014) (Tiihonen et al., 2017); 'inflammation' then became cluster #11 ('pharmacogenetics'; 5; S=0.997; 2017) (Mauri et al., 2014), cluster #10 ('cannabidiol'; 9; S=0.989; 2016) (McGuire et al., 2018), and #4 ('cytokines/pharmacokinetic'; 93; S=0.916; 2018) (Goldsmith et al., 2016) and cluster #6 in 2021 ('gut microbiome'; 75; S=0.842; 2017) (Penninx and Lange, 2018).To further examine research trends, we focused on the last five years co-citations reference network (2016-2021) and on each month of the last available year (2021) (Supplementary Figs. 456).

        <p>We extracted the timeline of the co-occurring authors' keyword network using 
            <rs type="software">CiteSpace</rs> (Fig. 2A). Six clusters of keywords were identified, and the most important was 'dopamine', followed by 'double blind', 'adherence', 'metabolic syndrome', 'MRI', and 'neuroleptic treatment'. We further extracted the same network while focusing on the 2016-2021 period (Fig. 2B), and seven clusters were identified. The most important cluster was 'prefrontal cortex', followed by 'adherence', 'MRI', 'metabolic syndrome', 'efficacy', 'pharmacogenetics', and 'bioavailability'. Both co-occurring author keywords networks (1980-2021 and 2016-2021) presented a significant silhouette score (S&gt;0.6) and an acceptable modularity score (Q&gt;0.3).

        <p>Moreover, the results for burstness revealed that the three most cited keywords ranked by the beginning of citation bursts were 'haloperidol ' (1990), 'neuroleptics ' (1990), and 'tardive dyskinesia' (1990) (Supplementary Table 2.Y.Z). When considering the 2016-2021 time period, the keywords with the latest beginning of citation burst revealed the latest keyword trends, which were 'nationwide cohort', 'target', 'nanoparticle', and 'real-world effectiveness'. In addition, the 2021 keywords with the strongest strength of citation bursts were 'relapse', 'gene expression', and 'discontinuation'.Moreover, the results for burstness revealed that the three most cited keywords ranked by the beginning of citation bursts were 'haloperidol ' (1990), 'neuroleptics ' (1990), and 'tardive dyskinesia' (1990) (Supplementary Table 2.Y.Z).

        <p>The second major trend concerns cognition in schizophrenia (clusters #25 (Goff et al., 1992), #21 (Gray et al., 1995), #7 (Meltzer and McGurk, 1999), #9 (Arnt andSkarsfeldt, 1998), #6(Keefe et al., 2007)); however, this trend of research has decreased since 2007.The second major trend concerns cognition in schizophrenia (clusters #25 (Goff et al., 1992), #21 (Gray et al., 1995), #7 (Meltzer and McGurk, 1999), #9 (Arnt andSkarsfeldt, 1998), #6(Keefe et al., 2007)); however, this trend of research has decreased since 2007.</p>
        <p>The third major research trend concerns treatment side effects starting with metabolic syndrome and its components (#13 (Allison et al., 1999); #4(ADA, 2004)) that continue and have now developed in evidence synthesis on metabolic syndrome (cluster #15 (Vancampfort et al., 2015)).The third major research trend concerns treatment side effects starting with metabolic syndrome and its components (#13 (Allison et al., 1999); #4(ADA, 2004)) that continue and have now developed in evidence synthesis on metabolic syndrome (cluster #15 (Vancampfort et al., 2015)).</p>
        <p>A focus on the last five years reveals that the latest trends of research were on treatment-resistant patients, maintenance/discontinuation of antipsychotics, evidence synthesis, and real-world effectiveness. More recently, in 2021, we identified evidence synthesis for negative symptoms, ultra-treatment resistance, the gut microbiome and cannabidiol (Supplementary Figs. 4 and6).A focus on the last five years reveals that the latest trends of research were on treatment-resistant patients, maintenance/discontinuation of antipsychotics, evidence synthesis, and real-world effectiveness.

        <p>To complete these findings, the burstness of keywords can help identify the latest trends of research, such as keywords referring to evidence synthesis (guideline, meta-analysis) or most recent trends of research (cannabidiol, discontinuation, nanoparticle) (Supplementary Table 2. AA to DD, Supplementary Fig. 7). These results confirm that evidence synthesis is a predominant trend of the last decade. In addition, most cited articles over the last 5 years were mainly meta-analyses and consensus guidelines (Supplementary Table 2.U.V), and our cooccurring author keywords networks also revealed that the number of network meta-analyses is rapidly increasing. Although these sixty years of research on antipsychotics and schizophrenia have generated massive data and treatment guidelines, many fundamental gaps in knowledge remain such as: the optimum length of treatment with antipsychotic medication; the heterogeneity in schizophrenia and treatment resistance; or also that current antipsychotic medications are not disease modifying (Howes and Kaar, 2018).To complete these findings, the burstness of keywords can help identify the latest trends of research, such as keywords referring to evidence synthesis (guideline, meta-analysis) or most recent trends of research (cannabidiol, discontinuation, nanoparticle) (Supplementary Table 2.

        <p>The collaboration network encompasses the network of coauthorship (Fig. 2) of co-authors' countries and institutions (Fig. 1A. B). Combined with the clusters of the co-citation reference network (Fig. 3), researchers can visualize the influence of research teams regarding the generation of scientific knowledge and evaluate possible candidates for research collaborations.The collaboration network encompasses the network of coauthorship (Fig. 2) of co-authors' countries and institutions (Fig. 1A.

        <p>Researchers can benefit from scientometric analyses in several ways (Nakagawa et al., 2019). For instance, the extracted corpus of publication of systematic reviews can be visualized, thereby synthetizing the major trends of research retrieved with selected search terms. Furthermore, the co-occurring author keywords networks and keywords burstness can reveal the most relevant keywords for a specific trend of research and thus help to select a string of keywords for database searches (Janssens and Gwinn, 2015). The evolution of research trends, with the most recent areas of research interest and productivity as well as trends thereof, is identified, with essential intellectual turning point papers that are frequently central papers of clusters (Supplementary Table 1). These turning-point papers are essential to understand the evolution of research trends, and can inform writing of introduction and rationale of systematic reviews (Chen, 2006a).Researchers can benefit from scientometric analyses in several ways (Nakagawa et al., 2019).

        <p>Specific networks of existing meta-analyses can also be extracted to identify major publications and research groups and help evaluate whether additional meta-analyses are required on a specific topic or if bursts of literature appear in a certain area, indicating the need for new meta-analysis (Ioannidis, 2016). Several limitations could also be more easily considered, such as publication years, methodological differences, or citation bias.Specific networks of existing meta-analyses can also be extracted to identify major publications and research groups and help evaluate whether additional meta-analyses are required on a specific topic or if bursts of literature appear in a certain area, indicating the need for new meta-analysis (Ioannidis, 2016).

        <p>Finally, journal analysis and co-cited journal analysis can provide important information that can help researchers select the most appropriate journals for article submission (Supplementary Fig. 10).Finally, journal analysis and co-cited journal analysis can provide important information that can help researchers select the most appropriate journals for article submission (Supplementary Fig. 10).</p>

        <p>Compared to narrative reviews, scientometric analyses can comprehensively guide clinicians and scholars on the history of research and emerging trends. Also, they can provide a synopsis of clinically relevant questions that have been poorly addressed in research, potentially informing future trials, although evidence synthesis methods are still not adequately taken into account in the design of future trials (Nikolakopoulou et al., 2019). Moreover, this work can help identify the most important authors and journals in the field of antipsychotics in schizophrenia, can guide more junior investigators in identifying mentors and institutions to seek out and inform stakeholders, policy-makers, and funding agencies on the directions of the clinical and scientific community using and studying antipsychotics (O'Leary et al., 2017).Compared to narrative reviews, scientometric analyses can comprehensively guide clinicians and scholars on the history of research and emerging trends.

        <p>The fact that the authors of this work have already published several systematic reviews on this topic and analyzed retrieved nodes when implementing networks in CiteSpace to detect possible errors, such as homonyms of the author, further helps to strengthen the quality of analysis. Considering the important number of references included and the good reliability of consistent clusters, we consider that the overall quality of our analysis is solid; however, we cannot exclude that some aberrant clusters were obtained. An important limitation of scientometric studies is the use of citation-related indicators, as scientometric studies can be a source of different biases, in particular, citation bias. Regardless of its quality or relevance, a reference can be cited for the sole purpose of underscoring the quality of a manuscript, thereby contributing to the underutilization of available evidence. Different parameters can contribute to citation bias, including self-citations, the authority of the author, journal impact factor, and the journal where the manuscript was accepted (Urlings et al., 2021). Additional potential biases include bias against novelty, outcome reporting bias, location bias, and publication bias (Wang et al., 2017).The fact that the authors of this work have already published several systematic reviews on this topic and analyzed retrieved nodes when implementing networks in CiteSpace to detect possible errors, such as homonyms of the author, further helps to strengthen the quality of analysis.

        <p>Publication bias consists of favoring publication of studies with significant results, withholding negative results from publication (Jannot et al., 2013;Joober et al., 2012). To address such limitations when comprehensively synthesizing the collaborative network and measuring scientific impact, novel measures of research combining bibliometric indicators, peer review results and altmetrics with more accurate assessments of scientific research are needed (Fenner, 2014).Publication bias consists of favoring publication of studies with significant results, withholding negative results from publication (Jannot et al., 2013;Joober et al., 2012).

        <p>One important bias that can be detected by a detailed examination of hotspots in the retrieved networks is citation distortion, consisting of distortions in the persuasive use of citations that can be used to establish unfounded scientific claims as fact (Greenberg, 2009).One important bias that can be detected by a detailed examination of hotspots in the retrieved networks is citation distortion, consisting of distortions in the persuasive use of citations that can be used to establish unfounded scientific claims as fact (Greenberg, 2009).</p>
        <p>Another limitation is that the gathered data were only obtained from WOSCC, which can lead to a relative incompleteness of the retrieved publication (Singh et al., 2021;Visser et al., 2021). For most databases, such as PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, full text and citation analyses are not available. Nevertheless, WOSCC is considered the most suitable database of scientometric studies, and the future development of software could make it possible to simultaneously analyze results from different databases with reliable automatic duplicate removal.Another limitation is that the gathered data were only obtained from WOSCC, which can lead to a relative incompleteness of the retrieved publication (Singh et al., 2021;Visser et al., 2021).

        <p>Of importance, our co-citation network only focused on first authors, which does not adequately reflect the authors' influence. In addition, some keywords have different expressions, which can affect clustering even after our checking procedure. Finally, more recent trends are not necessarily detected by the various co-cited networks since most recent publications are not sufficiently cited.Of importance, our co-citation network only focused on first authors, which does not adequately reflect the authors' influence.

        <p>This scientometric study provides historical insight and perspectives on research and publications on antipsychotics in schizophrenia research. The number of published papers significantly increased over the last 30 years, reaching a peak in 2010, followed by an average of more than 1400 articles per year. Most influential countries, institutions, and authors were identified, as were hotspots and the latest trends of research, such as resistant-treatment schizophrenia, maintenance/ discontinuation of antipsychotics, evidence synthesis, real-world effectiveness and new antipsychotic formulations. More collaboration is needed between institutions from the United States of America, European institutions, and the emerging influence of China. Our study provides useful information for researchers to understand the evolution of research on antipsychotics in schizophrenia and promises to provide useful information for researchers, grant applicants, funding agencies, and policy-makers.This scientometric study provides historical insight and perspectives on research and publications on antipsychotics in schizophrenia research.
