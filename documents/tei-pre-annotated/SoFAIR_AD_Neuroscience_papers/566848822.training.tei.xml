        <p>The biological pathways involved in the preclinical stage of the Alzheimer's continuum are not well understood.</p>
        <p>We used NeuroToolKit and Elecsys ® immunoassays to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β (Aβ)42, Aβ40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, IL6, S100, and α-synuclein in cognitively unimpaired participants of the ALFA+ study, many within the Alzheimer's continuum.</p>
        <p>are used for grading severity. 4 According to this framework, the term "Alzheimer's disease" is applied whenever there is evidence of Aβ and tau pathology, regardless of the clinical manifestations. When there is evidence of Aβ pathology but not tau, the term "Alzheimer's pathologic change" is used. Together, individuals with either "Alzheimer's pathologic change" or "Alzheimer's disease" belong to the so-called "Alzheimer's continuum.".</p>
        <p>AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) core biomarkers allow an accurate diagnostic and early identification of AD pathology. 5 AD CSF core biomarkers comprise Aβ42 and the Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau), which reflect Aβ pathology, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration, respectively. However, multiple additional pathophysiological processes occur in these early stages of the Alzheimer's continuum such as neuronal and axonal damage, [6][7][8][9] synaptic dysfunction, [10][11][12] neuroinflammation and glial response, [13][14][15] and αsynuclein or TDP-43 co-pathology. [16][17][18] In this context, the development of drugs targeting these processes may potentially modify the evolution of the disease.</p>
        <p>The pathophysiological events that occur in this early stage remain to be fully elucidated. This can be explained by several reasons. (1) It is particularly challenging to recruit individuals in the earliest extreme of the Alzheimer's continuum (Aβ-positive but still tau-negative, ie, preclinical Alzheimer's pathologic change). (2) Most cohorts include elders but not middle-age adults, when AD pathology most likely starts.</p>
        <p>(3) Most studies include a single or very low number of biomarkers and therefore it is difficult to assess the relationships between them. Recently, a very interesting study in the BioFINDER cohort modelled the changes in CSF and plasma biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitively impaired individuals. 19 They proposed a model with a sequence of events starting with changes in Aβ; followed by tau biomarkers; and, only after Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) became abnormal, changes in neuronal injury, and synaptic and glial biomarkers.</p>
        <p>Herein, we focused in cognitively unimpaired individuals and, very particularly, at the earliest stage of the Alzheimer's continuum. The main aim of our study is to define the pathophysiological events that occur in the preclinical stage of the continuum. We addressed the challenges described above by studying the well-characterized ALFA+ cohort, which includes cognitively unimpaired individuals, mainly in their middle age, and with a high prevalence of individuals that are Aβ positive but still tau negative. 20 Moreover, we measured several CSF biomarkers that mark the main pathogenic events described in AD: Aβ pathology (Aβ42, Aβ42/40 ratio), tau pathophysiology (p-tau), neurodegeneration (t-tau), axonal damage (neurofilament light [NfL]), synaptic dysfunction (neurogranin), microglial (sTREM2) and astroglial-related response (GFAP, YKL40, S100), other neuroinflammatory biomarkers (interleukin 6 [IL6]), and α-synuclein. We investigated how these CSF biomarkers change with age, sex, and Aβ pathology. Importantly, we modelled the sequence of biomarker changes during the preclinical stage of the Alzheimer's continuum to provide a model of the main pathophysiological changes in the earliest stage of the disease continuum.</p>
        <p>The ALFA+ cohort is a nested longitudinal study of the ALFA (for ALzheimer's and FAmilies) study. 20 The ALFA cohort was established as a research platform to characterize preclinical AD in 2743 cognitively unimpaired individuals, aged between 45 and 75 years old, and enriched for family history of AD (excluding autosomal-dominant AD).</p>
        <p>In the nested ALFA+ study, participants are longitudinally followed up and undergo a more comprehensive evaluation. CSF samples in these participants were obtained by lumbar puncture following standard procedures (see supporting information). Herein, we included the first consecutive 381 participants of ALFA+.</p>
        <p>CSF t-tau and p-tau were measured using the electrochemiluminescence immunoassays Elecsys ® Total-tau CSF and phosphor-tau(181P)</p>
        <p>CSF on a fully automated cobas e601 instrument (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd.). The rest of the biomarkers were measured with the prototype NeuroToolKit (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd.) on a cobas e411 or e601 instrument (supporting information). All measurements were performed at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Mölndal, Sweden.</p>
        <p>Aβ pathology positivity (A+) and tau pathology positivity (T+) were defined by CSF Aβ42/40 ratio and CSF p-tau, respectively. 21 We derived the cutoffs for each of these biomarkers using a two-Gaussian mixture modelling (GMM; supporting information). The cutoff was defined as the mean plus two standard deviations of the non-pathologic Gaussian distribution (ie, the Gaussian with the higher mean for CSF Aβ42/40 ratio and the Gaussian with the lower mean for ptau and p-tau/Aβ42 ratio). The resulting cutoffs were 0.071 for the Aβ42/40 ratio, 24 pg/mL for p-tau, and 0.013 for the p-tau/Aβ42 (Fig-</p>
        <p>ure S1 in supporting information).</p>
        <p>For each of the CSF biomarkers, we excluded the extreme values defined as either those that fell outside of three times the interquartile range below the first quartile (Q1) or those above the third quartile (Q3). In the main text, all the analyses were performed excluding extreme values, but including them rendered similar results (see Tables S2-S4 in supporting information). We tested for normality of the distribution for each biomarker using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and visual inspection of histograms. CSF Aβ42, p-tau, t-tau, NfL, neurogranin, YKL-40, GFAP, IL6, S100, α-synuclein, and the p-tau/Aβ42 ratio did not follow a normal distribution and were thus log 10 -transformed.</p>
        <p>CSF Aβ40, Aβ42/40 ratio, and sTREM2 followed a normal distribution and were not transformed.</p>
        <p>We conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test statistically significant differences on age and education among AT groups. To study the association of each CSF biomarker with demographic characteristics and APOE-ε4 status, we computed a linear regression model with age, sex, and APOE-ε4 status as predictor variables. We conducted these analyses stratifying by Aβ status and, additionally, including in the linear regression an "Aβ42/40 ratio x age" interaction term.</p>
        <p>We plotted CSF biomarkers levels as a function of CSF Aβ42/40, p-tau, and p-tau/Aβ42. We corrected each of the CSF biomarker values by age and sex and computed the mean and standard deviation of each biomarker in the A-T-group (reference group). We next converted CSF biomarker values to z-scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the reference group. The relationship between each CSF biomarker and the proxies of disease progression (ie, CSF Aβ42/40, p-tau, and p-tau/Aβ42) were modelled using a robust local weighted regression method (rlowess; "smooth" function in 
            <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> and a span of 300) and we plotted the resulting model. 22,23 Moreover, we calculated the linear regression slopes for each of the biomarkers in each of the negative or positive groups, using the previously described cutoffs. We computed the P-values testing the null hypothesis of whether the regression slope being equal to zero. In addition, the probability of the two regression slopes being equal was also calculated.
        </p>
        <p>For all the analyses, we applied a false discovery rate (FDR) multiple comparison correction following the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. 24 All tests were two-tailed, with a significance level of α = 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed in

        </p>
        <p>Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics and CSF biomarkers measurements of ALFA+ study participants. Of note, 13 (3.4%) participants fell into the A-T+ group (non-AD pathologic change). Because our aim was to study the Alzheimer's continuum, we excluded these 13 participants from all analyses, and they are only depicted in Table 1 and Figure 1 for descriptive purposes. AT groups differed in years of age and education and prevalence of APOE-ε4 status, but not in sex distribution or MMSE and FCSRT cognitive scores (Table 1).</p>
        <p>We observed significant differences in the mean values of CSF NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, S100, and α-synuclein between AT groups (Figure 1). Specifically, CSF NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL-40, GFAP, and α-synuclein were significantly higher in the A+T+ group compared to the A-T-and the A+T-groups (Table 1 and Figure 1).</p>
        <p>Adding years of education in the analyses as a covariate did not modify the results. Of note, none of the studied CSF biomarkers was increased in the A+T-group compared to the A-T-group.</p>
        <p>We also tested the correlations between the CSF biomarkers. In a partial correlation adjusting by age, all CSF tau-related, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal injury, and glial markers significantly and positively correlate with each other. There was a negative correlation between CSF Aβ42/40 and CSF p-tau, t-tau, NfL, neurogranin, GFAP, and S100, but not with the rest of the biomarkers (Figure S2 in supporting information).</p>
        <p>In the whole sample, CSF Aβ42, Aβ42/40, p-tau, t-tau, NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL-40, GFAP, and S100 were significantly associated with age (Table 2). We stratified the sample into those participants with normal AD biomarkers (A-T-; n = 237) and those within the Alzheimer's continuum biomarkers group (A+T*; n = 131). In the A-T-group, there was a significant association with a positive direction between age and CSF NfL, YKL-40, and GFAP (Figure 2). In contrast, in the A+T* group, there was a significant association with a positive direction between age and CSF p-tau, t-tau, NfL, neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL-40, GFAP, and α-synuclein (Figure 2). Importantly, we found a significant interaction between age and CSF Aβ42/40 only in the models with CSF p-tau, t-tau, and neurogranin as outcomes (Figure 2). Interestingly, there were sex differences in several CSF biomarkers, adjusting by the effect of age and APOE-ε4 status (Table 2). CSF NfL was higher in men, while CSF neurogranin was higher in women (Table 2). Minor (&lt; 10%) but significant differences were observed in CSF GFAP and IL6 (higher in men) and CSF Aβ40 and YKL-40 (higher in women). Including the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio as a covariable did not change the results, indicating that the observed differences in CSF biomarkers between sexes are not driven by Aβ pathology. In the studied sample, men had a higher education compared to women (Table S1 in supporting information). Adding education as a covariable in the aforementioned analyses only changed the observed sex differences to non-significant for Aβ40 (P = .075). Unlike age and sex, APOE-ε4 status was only significantly associated with CSF Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratio (Table 2).</p>
        <p>Finally, we modelled the trajectories of the standardized (z-scores) CSF biomarkers in the preclinical Alzheimer's continuum applying a robust local weighted regression method. Cognizant that this is a crosssectional analysis and to understand the changes against Aβ and tau, we anchored the model to: (1) Aβ42/40 ratio, (2) p-tau, and (3) ptau/Aβ42 ratio, as proxies of disease progression. Figure 3 shows the resulting plots. Moreover, for each CSF biomarker and each model, we computed the slopes of a given CSF biomarker before and after the cutoff for the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio, p-tau, or p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, respectively, and tested whether these slopes were statistically significantly different.</p>
        <p>Anchoring to CSF Aβ42/40 as a proxy of disease progression, we observed that CSF p-tau, t-tau, and neurogranin start to significantly increase as soon as the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio becomes positive and continue to increase across the preclinical Alzheimer's continuum, eventually reaching the highest z-scores of all CSF biomarkers (3 z-scores for CSF p-tau and t-tau and 2.5 z-scores for CSF neurogranin, compared to their basal levels, Figure 3A). In the CSF Aβ42/40-positive participants, the higher absolute slopes are those of CSF p-tau and t-tau, followed by CSF neurogranin (Table 3). These was not significantly different than that of Aβ-negative individuals (Table 3).</p>
        <p>When we used CSF p-tau as a proxy of disease progression, we observed that CSF Aβ42/40 dramatically decreases before CSF p-tau becomes positive. Importantly, CSF Aβ42/40 values already reach a decrease of four z-scores from the basal levels at the point when CSF p-tau becomes positive, and they plateau after (Figure 3B, Table 3).</p>
        <p>This result strongly suggests that changes in soluble Aβ precede those of tau pathophysiology. Remarkably, CSF neurogranin also started to increase before the CSF p-tau cutoff, reaching almost two z-scores from the basal levels at the point when CSF p-tau becomes positive, and plateaus in individuals that are already tau positive (Figure 3B, Table 3). The rest of CSF biomarkers (except CSF IL6) also increase as a function of CSF p-tau but their increase is less pronounced (&lt; 0.5 z-scores). As expected, CSF t-tau levels parallel those of CSF p-tau.</p>
        <p>When we used CSF p-tau/Aβ42 as a proxy of disease progression, the results were very similar to those of CSF p-tau. Before CSF p-tau/Aβ42 becomes positive (Figure 3C), CSF Aβ42/40 significantly decreases to later plateau, and eventually reach a decrease of six z-scores. In contrast, the rest of CSF biomarkers do not significantly change before the CSF p-tau/Aβ42 cutoff, but they significantly increase after surpassing this cutoff, except for CSF IL6 and S100 (Table 3). CSF p-tau and t-tau have the steeper slopes and reach &gt;4 z-scores of its basal levels. CSF neurogranin reaches two z-scores from its basal levels and the rest of CSF biomarkers showed a more moderate increase (&lt; 2 z-scores).</p>
        <p>In this cross-sectional study we aimed at determining CSF We initially observed that all CSF biomarkers (except IL6) increased in the A+T+ group, but not in the A+T-group. However, this approach has the limitation that it simplifies the preclinical stage of the Alzheimer's continuum in only two stages, that is A+T-and A+T+.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we applied two additional approaches in order to define more precisely the CSF biomarker changes in the Alzheimer's continuum. We first assessed the changes of CSF biomarkers as a function of age and, second, as a function of Aβ (as defined by the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio) and tau (as defined by CSF p-tau) pathophysiology.</p>
        <p>We observed that all biomarkers (except CSF Aβ40, IL6, and α-synuclein) increase with age. Interestingly, for CSF p-tau, t-tau, and neurogranin, this increase is specifically linked to Aβ pathology.</p>
        <p>When we used the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio as a proxy of disease progression, CSF p-tau, t-tau, and neurogranin are the biomarkers that change more markedly, and before the Aβ-positivity cutoff. This finding is consistent with the notion that CSF p-tau and neurogranin are biomarkers mainly related to AD, and less linked to other forms of neurodegeneration. 6,25,26 In contrast, CSF NfL and glial biomarkers CSF YKL40, GFAP, and sTREM2 (the latter approaching significance) change through aging in both Aβ-positive and -negative individuals. Although this increase is more pronounced in Aβ-positive than in negative individuals (as shown by the β slopes), the fact that there is no interaction between Aβ and age indicates that Aβ does not . Additionally, we also computed the "Aβ42/40 x age" interaction term. All P-values are corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR approach significantly modify the association between age and the specific CSF biomarker. These results are in line with previous studies that show that glial biomarkers increase with aging and also in other neurological diseases besides AD. [27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36] Of note, our sample comprises a higher prevalence of A+T-than A+T+ individuals. We speculate that the increase of CSF NfL and glial markers throughout age would be more Interestingly, we found sex differences in some of the studied CSF biomarkers. Men showed higher levels of NfL in CSF, which is consistent with previous studies, 38,39 and with the fact that the prevalence of A-T-N+ individuals (ie, neurodegeneration positive, as measured by hippocampal volume or cortical thickness, but Aβ-and tau-negative) is higher in men than in women. 40 An unexpected finding was that CSF neurogranin is overall higher in women than in men. Whether this indicates that women may have a greater susceptibility to synaptic dysfunction remains to be clarified in further studies. The effect of sex, often overlooked, should be further studied to better understand AD pathogenesis and design preventive strategies.</p>
        <p>The main limitation of cross-sectional biomarker studies in the sporadic preclinical Alzheimer's continuum is the lack of a proxy for the temporal evolution of the disease, such as the concept of estimated years from symptom onset in autosomal-dominant AD. We chose the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio to understand how biomarkers evolve during the continuum because changes in soluble Aβ are those that occur earlier in the Alzheimer's continuum, both in autosomal-dominant and sporadic AD, and occur before than Aβ PET becomes positive. 41,42 Moreover, CSF Aβ42/40 ratio is less affected by pre-analytical factors and interindividual differences than CSF Aβ42. Remarkably, the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio cutoff used here is higher (and thus expected to be more sensitive) than the one commonly used for diagnostic purposes, given that our goal is to sensitively detect very early changes in Aβ pathology. This is the reason why we used a two-Gaussian mixture modelling to determine the cutoff instead of conducting a comparison with a goldstandard (such as Aβ PET), which would have rendered a more specific cutoff for deposited Aβ but less sensitive for early soluble Aβ-related pathophysiological changes. Being aware that using the CSF Aβ42/40 ratio as a proxy of disease progression may seem that we are assuming a sequence of events in which soluble Aβ comes first, we also explored CSF biomarker changes using CSF p-tau and the p-tau/Aβ42 ratio as proxies, the latter being highly correlated with Aβ PET load. 43 We similarly computed the CSF p-tau and p-tau/Aβ42 cutoffs using a two-Gaussian mixture modelling and these resulted lower (thus expected to be more sensitive) than those usually used in the clinical setting.</p>
        <p>Even with such sensitive cutoffs, changes in CSF Aβ42/40 always come first, before CSF p-tau or the p-tau/Aβ42 become positive or before any other biomarker changes. Using these models, we also observed the initial increase in CSF neurogranin, earlier than changes in neuronal and axonal injury and glial-related biomarkers. Overall, these results are similar to those that have been reported in autosomal-dominant AD in both cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies, in which initial changes in Aβ are followed by tau-related biomarkers and, afterward, neurodegeneration and glial markers. 1,2,15,[44][45][46][47] Recently, a very interesting study in the BIOFINDER cohort modelled the changes in several CSF and plasma biomarkers in predementia individuals. 19 The authors used Aβ PET as a proxy of the disease progression, instead of CSF Aβ42/40, but their results were similar. The main difference with our study is that we observe earlier changes in CSF neurogranin, while they observed an early inflection of CSF NfL. We may argue that changes in soluble Aβ are more linked to early synaptic dysfunction, while Aβ deposition (as measured by Aβ PET) captures a slightly later event that may be more associated to neuronal injury. Moreover, our study includes a high number of cognitively unimpaired individuals that are Aβ positive but still tau negative, which may have allowed us to observe these early changes in CSF neurogranin.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting the local regression methods we applied to model the association between CSF biomarker changes as a function of CSF Aβ42/40, p-tau, or p-tau/Aβ42. These methods are particularly suited to model non-linear associations without the need to specify any function or fit a model a priori. Still, the smoothing parameter ("span") needs to be specified. To this end, we chose a smoothing parameter that produced curves with a maximum of two inflection (change) points to avoid overfitting. Similar methods have been applied in previous reports displaying the cross-sectional variation of CSF and other biomarkers against proxies of AD progression. 2,41,45 The main limitations of our study are the following. In conclusion, our study shows that biomarkers reflecting multiple pathophysiological pathways change very early in the Alzheimer's continuum. tau-related and synaptic biomarkers are those that change earlier and more markedly, as soon as there is evidence of incipient Aβ pathology. In order to develop therapeutic strategies targeting this early stage, it is fundamental to understand "which" are the</p>
