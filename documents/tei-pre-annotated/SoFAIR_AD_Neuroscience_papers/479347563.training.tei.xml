        <p>An essential step toward understanding brain function is to establish a structural framework with cellular resolution on which multi-scale datasets spanning molecules, cells, circuits and systems can be integrated and interpreted 1 . Here, as part of the collaborative Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we derive a comprehensive cell type-based anatomical description of one exemplar brain structure, the mouse primary motor cortex, upper limb area (MOp-ul). Using genetic and viral labelling, barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing, single-neuron reconstruction, whole-brain imaging and cloud-based neuroinformatics tools, we delineated the MOp-ul in 3D and refined its sublaminar organization. We defined around two dozen projection neuron types in the MOp-ul and derived an inputoutput wiring diagram, which will facilitate future analyses of motor control circuitry across molecular, cellular and system levels. This work provides a roadmap towards a comprehensive cellular-resolution description of mammalian brain architecture.An essential step toward understanding brain function is to establish a structural framework with cellular resolution on which multi-scale datasets spanning molecules, cells, circuits and systems can be integrated and interpreted 1 .

        <p>The brain is an information processing network comprising a set of nodes interconnected with sophisticated wiring patterns. Superimposed on this anatomical infrastructure are genetically encoded molecular machines that mediate cellular processes, shaping the neural circuit dynamics underlying cognition and behaviour. Historically, brain organization has been explored using different techniques at descending levels of granularity: grey matter regions (macroscale), cell types (mesoscale), individual cells (microscale) and synapses (nanoscale) 1 . MRI and classic anatomical tracing have produced macroscale connectomes in human 2 and other mammalian brains [3][4][5] , providing a panoramic-but still coarse-view of organizational principles for further exploration 6 . An essential step toward a comprehensive understanding of brain function is to establish a structural framework with cellular resolution on which multi-scale and multi-modal information spanning molecules, cells, circuits and systems can be registered, integrated, interpreted and mined.The brain is an information processing network comprising a set of nodes interconnected with sophisticated wiring patterns.

        <p>Recognizing this emerging opportunity, the BICCN established a multi-laboratory collaboration with the goal of systematically classifying neuron types and mapping multi-scale connectivity in the mouse brain. As a first step, we focused our combined efforts on the MOp-ul. We applied expertise in cell-type-targeted genetic and viral Article labelling, high resolution whole-brain imaging, barcoded anatomy resolved by sequencing (BARseq)-based projection mapping 11 , complete single-neuron morphological reconstruction, and state-of-the-art neuroinformatic methods for CCF registration. We derived a comprehensive, projection neuron (PN) type-based wiring diagram of the mouse MOp-ul that will facilitate future analyses of motor control infrastructure across molecular, cellular and systems levels. This exemplar brain structure provides a roadmap towards a cellular description of mammalian whole-brain architecture and the multi-scale connectome.Recognizing this emerging opportunity, the BICCN established a multi-laboratory collaboration with the goal of systematically classifying neuron types and mapping multi-scale connectivity in the mouse brain.

        <p>We established an integrated cross-laboratory anatomical analysis platform comprising myriad technologies, tools, methods, data analyses, visualizations and web-based portals for open access to data and tools 3,4,8,10,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] (Extended Data Fig. 1, Methods).

        <p>The spatial location of rodent primary motor cortex (MOp) has been defined by cytoarchitecture, micro-or optogenetic-stimulation 28 and anatomical tracing 29,30 , yet discrepancies remain, including between standard 2D and 3D mouse brain reference atlases 10,[31][32][33] . Here, we first defined the MOp-ul borders in 3D using a collaborative workflow with multimodal data co-registered and cloud-visualized 26,27 at full resolution for joint review, delineation and reconciliation (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Video 1; datasets can be viewed at https://viz.neurodata.io/?json_ url=https://json.neurodata.io/v1?NGStateID=LwZ24nSZk1JTHw).The spatial location of rodent primary motor cortex (MOp) has been defined by cytoarchitecture, micro-or optogenetic-stimulation 28 and anatomical tracing 29,30 , yet discrepancies remain, including between standard 2D and 3D mouse brain reference atlases 10,[31][32][33] .

        <p>MOp-ul shares its lateral border with the primary somatosensory area (SSp); seen in Nissl-and NeuroTrace-stained sections as a transition from larger layer 5 (L5) somas in MOp to smaller somas in the SSp cell-sparse L5a and cell-dense L5b sublayers (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 2a,b; see also the Allen Reference Atlas 33 (ARA) and http://brainmaps.org). MOp is classically described as agranular cortex, but we identified a 'granular' L4, with densely packed small somas throughout primary (MOp) and secondary (MOs) motor cortex, albeit narrower than in SSp (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 2b; see also algorithmic analysis of MOp-SSp border, revealing individual variations between animals in Extended Data Fig. 2c,d, Supplementary Information).MOp-ul shares its lateral border with the primary somatosensory area (SSp); seen in Nissl-and NeuroTrace-stained sections as a transition from larger layer 5 (L5) somas in MOp to smaller somas in the SSp cell-sparse L5a and cell-dense L5b sublayers (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 2a,b; see also the Allen Reference Atlas 33 (ARA) and http://brainmaps.org).

        <p>Next, we used neuron-type distribution and long-range projection patterns in determining areal delineations 3,10,20,31 . The density of VGluT1 (also known as Slc17a7)-positive neurons corroborated the transition of L4 and L5 at the MOp-SSp border (Fig. 1a,b, Supplementary Video 2), and VGluT3 + neurons highlighted the MOp-ul-MOs medial border (Fig. 1a,b). Lateral and medial borders were further delineated by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based axonal labelling from SSp upper limb area (SSp-ul) to MOp-ul, and from ventrolateral orbital area (ORBvl) or dorsal retrosplenial area (RSPd) to MOs 3 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Rostro-caudal borders were defined using AAVretro tracing from the cervical (to delineate upper limb) or lumbar (to delineate lower limb) spinal cord (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 3b,c,4, Supplementary Video 1). This revealed two adjacent clusters of cervical spinal cord-projecting neurons: a medial cluster in MOp L5 (projecting to the intermediate and ventral horn) and a lateral cluster underneath SSp L4 (projecting to the dorsal horn) (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 4,5i). Finally, the MOp-ul borders were further validated using triple anterograde labelling. Injecting AAV-RFP, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL) and AAV-GFP into MOs, MOp-ul and SSp, respectively, revealed topographically organized, discrete terminal fields in different brain structures (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 5).Next, we used neuron-type distribution and long-range projection patterns in determining areal delineations 3,10,20,31 .

        <p>MOp-ul borders were drawn on the CCFv3 average template 10 using Neuroglancer to render a 3D volume aligned with other 3D histological data (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2e, Supplementary Video 2).

        <p>Using the new MOp-ul volume delineation as a region of interest, we precisely mapped cell type distributions for several genetically identified cell populations, for example, glutamatergic (VGluT1 + ), GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) (GAD2 + ) neurons, major GABAergic subpopulations, and other Cre driver-based populations 12,20 (Extended Data Fig. 3d).Using the new MOp-ul volume delineation as a region of interest, we precisely mapped cell type distributions for several genetically identified cell populations, for example, glutamatergic (VGluT1 + ), GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) (GAD2 + ) neurons, major GABAergic subpopulations, and other Cre driver-based populations 12,20 (Extended Data Fig. 3d).</p>
        <p>The traditional parcellation of cortex into 6 or 8 layers is based largely on cytoarchitecture 34 , developmental evidence 35 and long-range projection patterns 36 . Cortical PNs comprise three broad classes: (1) intratelencephalic (IT), primarily targeting cortex and striatum with somas in L2-L6; (2) pyramidal tract (PT) (also known as extratelencephalic (ET)), projecting to lower brainstem and spinal cord with somas in L5; and (3) corticothalamic (CT), projecting to the thalamus with somas in L6 37 . To examine the finer-scale relationship between PNs and soma distribution across layers in MOp-ul, we injected classic retrograde (fluorogold and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB)) and rabies viral tracers into 15 known MOp targets in cortex, contralateral caudoputamen (CP), thalamus, midbrain, pons, medulla and spinal cord (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 3b,c,7). Labelled MOp-ul PNs were classified according to soma position and projection target (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 3b,c,7), and included 16 types of IT, 7 types of ET and 3 types of CT neurons. These experiments also revealed a more AAV-RFP (red), PHAL (pink) and AAV-GFP (green) were injected into the MOs, MOp-ul and SSp, respectively (inset, right), revealing mostly non-overlapping terminal fields in the thalamic nuclei, mediodorsal nucleus (MD), CL, PCN and PO (Extended Data Fig. 5).

        <p>Of note, we found several novel IT types: (1) temporal association area (TEa)-projecting neurons in L2 and L5, which generate symmetrical or asymmetrical projections to the two hemispheres; (2) MOs-and SSp-projecting neurons in L4; and (3) ipsilateral projecting neurons in L6b (Extended Data Fig. 7). As these PN types were defined on the basis of single-target retrograde tracing, we validated collateral projections in a subset of types using Cre-dependent, target-defined AAV anterograde tracing (Extended Data Fig. 8a). This method revealed several notable findings (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c): both L5a and L5b IT neurons generate bilateral cortical projections. However, L5a IT neurons preferentially innervate ipsilateral CP, whereas L5b IT neurons generate dense bilateral CP projections. Furthermore, axonal terminals of L5b IT neurons are densely clustered into one specific CP domain 13 , whereas those arising from the L5a IT neurons spread diffusely into other CP domains.Of note, we found several novel IT types: (1) temporal association area (TEa)-projecting neurons in L2 and L5, which generate symmetrical or asymmetrical projections to the two hemispheres; (2) MOs-and SSp-projecting neurons in L4; and (3) ipsilateral projecting neurons in L6b (Extended Data Fig. 7).

        <p>Axonal projections from rodent motor cortex have been studied extensively 37,[40][41][42][43] . However, it is challenging to directly compare these independently generated data, as they exist in different spatial frameworks. We integrated our datasets in CCF to map the output of 
            <rs type="software">MOp-ul</rs> at regional and cell-type levels. First, we labelled the overall 
            <rs type="software">MOp-ul</rs> output patterns with PHAL 3,13 . 
            <rs type="software">MOp-ul</rs> projects to more than 110 targets in brain and spinal cord, with approximately 60 receiving moderate to dense innervation (Extended Data Figs. 5, 10, Supplementary Information). Second, we mapped projections from L2/3, L4, L5 IT, L5 ET and L6 CT PN types with Cre-dependent viral tracers in lines selective for these cell types 4,17 (Fig. 2a,b). Synaptic innervation of targets (versus passing fibres) was also confirmed in a subset of experiments using two alternative viral tracing methods (Extended Data Fig. 11).

        <p>We quantified labelled axons in 314 ipsilateral and contralateral grey matter regions in CCFv3 10 , creating a weighted connectivity matrix to visualize brain-wide projection patterns (Fig. 2c, Source Data Fig. 2). Outputs from MOp-ul predominantly target isocortex, striatum and thalamus (44.9, 29.0 and 8.1% of total axon density, respectively) with less axon in midbrain, medulla and pons (Extended Data Fig. 13d). Cre-defined projection mapping revealed distinct components of the regional output pathway (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Figs. 12, 13a, 14). Projections in Sepw1-L2/3, Cux2-L2/3, Nr5a1-L4, Scnn1a-L4/5, Plxnd1-L2/3 + L5, and Tlx3-L5 were restricted to isocortex and CP, the defining IT feature. Projections in Sim1-L5 and Fezf2-L5/6 were predominantly subcortical, consistent with the ET classification. Projections in Ntsr1-L6 and Tle4-L6 targeted thalamic nuclei, reflective of CT. Several Cre lines labelled multiple PN classes, for example, IT and ET in Rbp4-L5 (Fig. 2a,c, Extended Data Fig. 12).We quantified labelled axons in 314 ipsilateral and contralateral grey matter regions in CCFv3 10 , creating a weighted connectivity matrix to visualize brain-wide projection patterns (Fig. 2c, Source Data Fig. 2).

        <p>We performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the basis of connectivity weights in all brain regions and identified four main clusters (Fig. 2c). Cluster 1 comprised all experiments with L5 ET cells, including PHAL, AAV-GFP and Rbp4-L5 IT/ET. Cluster 2 contained L6 CT projections, that is, Ntsr1-L6 and Tle4-L6. Clusters 3 and 4 contained IT PN types: Cux2-L2/3, Tlx3-L5 and Plxnd1-L2/3 + L5 in cluster 3, and Sepw1-L2/3, Nr5a1-L4 and Scnn1a-L4 in cluster 4. Clustering confirmed the visual classification of anterograde tracing into expected major PN types, but notable differences do exist in the relative fraction of total projections per structure between lines in the same cluster (for example, Tle4-L6 versus Ntsr1-L6; Extended Data Fig. 13d, left).

        <p>Next we mapped brain-wide inputs to MOp at region and cell-type levels from three types of tracing experiments (Fig. 3aNext we mapped brain-wide inputs to MOp at region and cell-type levels from three types of tracing experiments (Fig. 3a</p>

CTB tracing revealed the overall set of input areas projecting to MOp-ul, including somatomotor cortical regions (MOp, SSp, supplemental somatosensory area (SSs) and MOs) and related thalamic nuclei (ventral anterior-lateral complex (VAL), parafascicular nucleus (PF), posterior complex (PO) and ventral medial nucleus (VM)) (Extended Data Figs. 10, 15). Monosynaptic rabies tracing from Cre-and target-defined neurons showed highly similar global input patterns (Extended Data Figs. 13b, 15, 16a). Notably, rabies viral tracing labelled inputs to MOp-ul from pallidal (globus pallidus, external segment (GPe), globus pallidus, internal segment (GPi) and central amygdalar nucleus, capsular part (CEAc)) and other subcortical regions (superior central nucleus raphe (CS) and dorsal raphe (DR)) not seen with CTB (Extended Data Fig. 15). Labelled inputs to MOp-ul were quantified across the entire brain in each CCFv3 region to create a weighted connectivity matrix (Fig. 3c, Source Data Fig. 3). Input arises mostly from cells in isocortex and thalamus (90.1%, 7.7%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 13f, pie chart). Consistent with visual observation of highly similar brain-wide input patterns, unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed only two main clusters (Fig. 3c). The first (larger) cluster comprised CTB and most Cre line rabies tracing datasets. The second cluster comprised all TRIO experiments and one Cre-dependent experiment (Foxp2-L6). The clusters differed significantly in in-degree (average n = 91 versus 30 input regions, P &lt; 0.0001, two-tailed t-test), suggesting that on average a more restricted set of inputs is labelled from target-defined projection classes.of Cre-dependent monosynaptic rabies viral tracers in the Cre lines described above plus three interneuron-selective lines (Pvalb, Sst and Vip); and (3) a modified tracing the relationship between input and output (TRIO) strategy combining AAVretro-Cre with monosynaptic rabies viral tracing to reveal inputs to projection target-defined neuron types 44 (Extended Data Fig. 16a). CTB tracing revealed the overall set of input areas projecting to MOp-ul, including somatomotor cortical regions (MOp, SSp, supplemental somatosensory area (SSs) and MOs) and related thalamic nuclei (ventral anterior-lateral complex (VAL), parafascicular nucleus (PF), posterior complex (PO) and ventral medial nucleus (VM)) (Extended Data Figs. 10, 15). Monosynaptic rabies tracing from Cre-and target-defined neurons showed highly similar global input patterns (Extended Data Figs. 13b, 15, 16a). Notably, rabies viral tracing labelled inputs to MOp-ul from pallidal (globus pallidus, external segment (GPe), globus pallidus, internal segment (GPi) and central amygdalar nucleus, capsular part (CEAc)) and other subcortical regions (superior central nucleus raphe (CS) and dorsal raphe (DR)) not seen with CTB (Extended Data Fig. 15). Labelled inputs to MOp-ul were quantified across the entire brain in each CCFv3 region to create a weighted connectivity matrix (Fig. 3c, Source Data Fig. 3). Input arises mostly from cells in isocortex and thalamus (90.1%, 7.7%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 13f, pie chart).

        <p>Together, our data suggest that the sets of regions providing input to Cre-and target-defined MOp-ul neuron types are similar, a surprising result given distinct axonal lamination patterns from cortical and thalamic sources 17,45 (Extended Data Fig. 16b). This result is nonetheless consistent with other recent findings that global input patterns mapped with rabies tracer methods are independent of starter cell type 46 . These results do not exclude the possibility of distinct presynaptic neuron types within a source area projecting to specific types within MOp. Notably, all input sources to MOp were also projection targets, indicating prevalent reciprocal areal connections with comparable strengths (Extended Data Fig. 10). In summary, integrated analyses of retrograde tracing experiments revealed a consensus brain-wide input map to MOp-ul (Fig. 3d).Together, our data suggest that the sets of regions providing input to Cre-and target-defined MOp-ul neuron types are similar, a surprising result given distinct axonal lamination patterns from cortical and thalamic sources 17,45 (Extended Data Fig. 16b).

Consistent with previous reports and with the above tract tracing results, these four classes occupy distinct laminar positions (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 19a-c, Supplementary Information). Beyond these classes, further divisions by projection patterns (Methods) resulted in 18 subgroups with distinct laminar distributions (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 19d-k, Supplementary Information).

        <p>Differential distribution across layers explains some of the diversity in IT projection patterns, but projections from cells in a sublayer remained highly structured. For example, 72-93% of IT neurons in L3 to L5b-d projecting to contralateral MOs (MOs-contra) also target ipsilateral MOs (MOs-ipsi), whereas only 32-50% of IT neurons without MOs-contra projections target MOs-ipsi (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 19l). This interdependence between contralateral and ipsilateral projections also generalized to other homotypic pairs of projections (Extended Data Fig. 19l). By contrast, in some cases the relationships between target pairs varied across sublayers. For example, in superficial layers (L2 for MOs-ipsi, and L2-4 for ipsilateral SSs (SSs-ipsi)), neurons with MOs-ipsi and SSs-ipsi projections were unlikely to also make contralateral projections to MOp-contra, whereas in the middle layers these ipsilateral projections had no predictive value about the corresponding contralateral projection (Fig. 4f). Similar relationships exist between pairs of contralateral projections (for example, MOp-contra and contralateral somatosensory area (SS-contra); Fig. 4f). These observations suggest that IT neurons in superficial sublayers (L2/3) have more dedicated and selective projections, whereas IT neurons in middle and deep sublayers (L5a, 5b and 6a) have broader projections (Fig. 4g). Therefore, the laminar distribution of neurons not only predicts the areas to which neurons project to, as revealed by retrograde labelling (Fig. 1d), but also affect higher-order statistics-that is, projection selectivity.Differential distribution across layers explains some of the diversity in IT projection patterns, but projections from cells in a sublayer remained highly structured.

        <p>IT cells and Cre line tracer experiments are in C6-C13. IT clusters are differentiated by: (1) soma layer (enriched for L2/3 in C7, C10 and C11, and L4 in C7 and C13); (2) number of targets per experiment (C8 has significantly more non-zero targets than all other IT clusters; one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc test, P &lt; 0.0001); and (3) fraction of axon in specific targets (two-way repeated measures ANOVA, P &lt; 0.0001 interaction effect of cluster × target area).

        <p>Despite substantial progress in cell-type censuses, a rigorous definition of PN types remains elusive. Some PN types are well aligned with transcriptomic types-for example, two transcriptomic types of TEaectorhinal area (ECT)-perirhinal area (PERI)-projecting neurons in L2 and L5 exist with distinguishable asymmetric or symmetric projection patterns to their ipsilateral or contralateral targets, among several other examples 7,41,51 . However, mapping between PN types and transcriptome types is not always clear 9,52 . For example, we identified L6 CT VM-projecting neurons that differ from other CT neurons by their location in deep L6a and L6b (Fig. 1d). Spatial transcriptomics 51 also identified several L6 CT clusters distributed across top to bottom of L6; but how these anatomical and molecular types relate to each other remains to be determined. The correspondence between molecularly and anatomically defined PN types will be clarified by future studies and will probably require further method development 53 . Knowledge of evolutionary conservation and divergence of brain structures often yields insights into organizational principles. Previous cross-species comparisons of mammalian brains have largely focused on the macroscale, such as cortical areas and layers, leaving many open questions regarding what is and is not conserved. The joint molecular and anatomic identification of PNs provides a higher resolution and more robust metric for cross-species translation. Although the primate cortex has more functionally distinct areas and potentially orders of magnitude larger cortical networks than in rodents, a PN-type-resolution analysis may reveal truly conserved core subnetworks and novel species innovations.

Three types of CT neurons are shown representing different combinations of thalamic targets and MOp-ul layers of origin. Three of four types of ET neurons are also shown, projecting to subcortical targets involved in different motor functions: (1) cortico-spinal outputs to the cervical spinal cord controlling goal-directed upper limb motor activities, such as reaching and grasping; (2) cortico-medullar projections to and output from the reticular formation (for example, medullary reticular nucleus (MDRN)) are implicated in task-specific aspects of skilled motor programs 49 ; (3) cortico-tectal projections to the SC are implicated in coordinating movements of eye, head, neck and forelimbs during navigation and goal-oriented behaviours (such as defensive and foraging behaviour) and (4) cortico-pontine projections to the pontine grey, which generates mossy fibres to the cerebellum (which is critically involved in associative motor learning).

A subset of cortical and striatal projection patterns is shown from the diverse MOp-ul IT cell types (six IT cell types in L2-L6b). Three types of CT neurons are shown representing different combinations of thalamic targets and MOp-ul layers of origin. Three of four types of ET neurons are also shown, projecting to subcortical targets involved in different motor functions: (1) cortico-spinal outputs to the cervical spinal cord controlling goal-directed upper limb motor activities, such as reaching and grasping; (2) cortico-medullar projections to and output from the reticular formation (for example, medullary reticular nucleus (MDRN)) are implicated in task-specific aspects of skilled motor programs 49 ; (3) cortico-tectal projections to the SC are implicated in coordinating movements of eye, head, neck and forelimbs during navigation and goal-oriented behaviours (such as defensive and foraging behaviour) and (4) cortico-pontine projections to the pontine grey, which generates mossy fibres to the cerebellum (which is critically involved in associative motor learning). These ET neurons also generate collateral projections to other structures in the motor system, such as GPe, ZI, STN, RN and IO.

        <p>Tracer injection experiments. The Mouse Connectome Project uses a variety of combinations of anterograde and retrograde tracers to simultaneously visualize multiple anatomical pathways within the same Nissl-stained mouse brain 3,13 . Triple anterograde tracing experiments involved three separate injections of 2.5% PHAL (Vector Laboratories, catalogue (cat.) no. L-1110, RRID:AB 2336656), and adeno-associated viruses encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP; AAV2/1.hSynapsin.EGFP.WPRE.bGH; Penn Vector Core) and tdTomato (AAV1.CAG.tdtomato.WPRE.SV40; Penn Vector Core). Retrograde tracers included CTB Alexa Fluor conjugates 647, 555 and 488 (0.25%; Invitrogen), Fluorogold (FG; 1%; Fluorochrome, LLC), and AAVretro-EF1a-Cre (AAV-retro-Cre; Viral Vector Core; Salk Institute for Biological Studies). Retrograde tracing from the spinal cord (Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 4) was performed with AAVretro-hSyn-GFP-WPRE (Addgene, cat. no. 50465) and AAVretro-hSyn-Cre-WPRE (Addgene, cat. no. 105553) in Ai14 tdTomato Cre-reporter mice ( Jackson Laboratories, stock no. 007914, aged 2-3 months). To further establish synaptic connectivity in downstream targets of MOp-ul (Extended Data Fig. 11), AAV-hSyn-mRuby2-sypEGFP (custom design, laboratory of B.K.L.) was used to label axons-of-passage with mRuby2 (red) and presynaptic puncta with EGFP (green). Patterns of synaptic innervation were further demonstrated in Ai14 mice using injections of self-complementary (sc) AAV1-hSyn-Cre (Vigene Biosciences; 2.8 × 10 13 GC per ml), which is capable of anterograde transneuronal spread to post-synaptic targets 18,20 .Tracer injection experiments.

        <p>Tracer injections. Whole-brain axonal projections from MOp-ul were labelled with AAV using the previously established Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas pipeline. Experimental methods and procedures have been described previously 4,17 . In brief, a pan-neuronal AAV expressing EGFP (AAV2/1.hSynapsin.EGFP.WPRE.bGH, Penn Vector Core, AV-1-PV1696, Addgene ID 105539) was used for stereotaxic injections into wild-type C57BL/6J mice. To label genetically defined populations of neurons, we used a Cre-dependent AAV that expresses EGFP within the cytoplasm of Cre-expressing infected neurons (AAV2/1. pCAG.FLEX.EGFP.WPRE.bGH, Penn Vector Core, AV-1-ALL854, Addgene ID 51502). For retrograde mono-synaptic whole-brain tracing of inputs to Cre-defined cell types in MOp-ul, we used a dual-virus strategy (S.Y. et al., manuscript in preparation and refs. 59,60 ). A Cre-dependent rAAV helper virus co-expressing TVA receptor, rabies glycoprotein (G), and tdTomato in the cytoplasm of Cre-expressing infected neurons (AAV1-Syn-DIO-TVA66T-dTom-N2cG) was injected stereotaxically into MOp, followed 21 ± 3 days layer by another injection in the same location of a G-deleted, ASLV type A (EnvA) pseudotyped rabies virus expressing a nuclear GFP reporter (RV.CVS-N2c(deltaG)-H2bEGFP).

        <p>Imaging and post-acquisition processing. STPT imaging procedures were previously described 20,21 (TissueCyte 1000, TissueVision). In brief, following AAV tracer injections, brains were imaged at high xy resolution (0.35 µm × 0.35 µm) every 100 µm along the rostrocaudal z-axis. Images of rabies tracer-labelled nuclei were also collected every 100 µm, but were imaged at 0.875 µm × 0.875 µm xy resolution. Images underwent quality control and manual annotation of injection sites, followed by signal detection and registration to the CCFv3 through an informatics data pipeline 10,61 (IDP). The IDP manages the processing and organization of the images and quantified data for downstream analyses. The two key algorithms in the IDP are signal detection and image registration. For segmentation, high-threshold edge information was combined with spatial distance-conditioned low-threshold edge results to form candidate signal object sets. The candidate objects were then filtered based on their morphological attributes such as length and area using connected component labelling. In addition, high-intensity pixels near the detected objects were included into the signal pixel set. Detected objects near hyper-intense artifacts occurring in multiple channels were removed. The output is a full-resolution mask that classifies each pixel as either signal or background. An isotropic 3D summary of each brain is constructed by dividing each image series into 10 µm × 10 µm × 10 µm grid voxels. Total signal is computed for each voxel by summing the number of signal-positive pixels in that voxel.

            <rs type="software">MOp-ul</rs>. We generated a weighted connectivity matrix with data obtained from all anterograde tracer experiments 60 for Fig. 2. Experiments and data are provided in Source Data Fig. 2. Segmentation and registration outputs are combined to quantify signal for every voxel in CCFv3. To quantify signal per brain structure, segmentation results are combined for all voxels with the same structure annotation. We defined connection weight in these analyses as the fraction of total axon volume; that is, the axon volume segmented per each brain region divided by the total axon volume across all regions, excluding the injection site (MOp). We note that even with stringent quality control, informatically derived measures of connection weights can include artefacts (false positives), and the AAV-EGFP tracer reports signal from labelled axons, including passing fibres and synaptic terminals. For this reason, all targets (n = 628 total, 314 per hemisphere) were visually inspected for presence of axon terminals, and a binary mask was generated to reflect 'true positives' for these regions. We applied the true positive binary mask to remove true negative connections and regions with only fibres of passage. We compiled a weighted matrix and performed comparative analyses across tracer datasets acquired from multiple laboratories (Allen, Z.J.H. and H.-W.D.). In the case of data from the Z.J.H. laboratory, integration was straightforward as these experiments were directly registered to CCFv3 as in the Allen pipeline. The H.-W.D. laboratory data were mapped to CCFv3 by matching structure name. As the ontology of the CCFv3 is derived from the ARA, corresponding structures were easily identified for most regions.

The total volume of detected signal was informatically derived for each brain structure in CCFv3, as described above for axon segmentation. In contrast to the heavily manual quality control for axonal projection false positives, we estimated segmentation false positives per CCFv3 structure for the rabies data by quantifying segmentation results from n = 89-97 'blank' brains; that is, brains processed through the imaging and informatics pipeline without rabies-mediated GFP expression. The distribution of false positives per structure was used to set a minimum threshold of six standard deviations from the mean. Any structure not passing this threshold was set to zero. Following this threshold step, the input connection weights were defined as the fraction of fluorescent signal segmented per brain region divided by the total volume above threshold for this set of regions, again excluding the injection site (MOp).We generated a weighted connectivity matrix with data obtained from all retrograde tracer experiments for Fig. 3.

        <p>For anterograde tracing, AAVs serotype 8 (UNC Vector Core, Salk Institute for Biological Studies) were delivered by stereotaxic injection. Detailed procedures are described in Supplementary Information. In brief, cell-type specific anterograde tracing was conducted in the mouse knock-in CreER and Cre driver lines. CreER drivers were crossed with the Rosa26-CAG-LSL-Flp mouse converter line such that tamoxifen induction of CreER expression at a given time is converted to constitutive Flp expression for anterograde tracing with a Flp-dependent AAV vector. For anterograde tracing from Foxp2-IRES-Cre driver line, we used a Cre-dependent AAV to express EGFP in labelled axons. Three weeks after injection, mice were perfused with 4% PFA in PBS, brains were dissected out and processed for tissue collection.For anterograde tracing, AAVs serotype 8 (UNC Vector Core, Salk Institute for Biological Studies) were delivered by stereotaxic injection.

To image starter cells, sections encompassing the injection site were imaged using a 20× objective with a 5-µm step-size on a Zeiss LSM 780 or 710 confocal microscope (CSHL St Giles Advanced Microscopy Center) using matched fluorescent filters. Images were auto-stitched from tiled scanning into TIF image files and compiled into maximum intensity projection images for sections encompassing the injection site. Input cells were manually annotated within the serial sections to extract their position within the dataset. We matched the serial sections to the corresponding sections from CCFv3. Then, we placed fiduciary landmarks on both data and CCFv3 sections for warping conducted using moving least squares in

        <p>Dendritic morphology analysis was carried out at the H.-W.D. and X.W.Y. laboratories at UCLA. Several consortium partners in this project contributed two neuronal reconstruction datasets (that is, UCLA, USC and AIBS; Extended Data Figure 17). Both entailed sparse labelling of layer 2-5 pyramidal neurons using similar though distinct methodologies. The UCLA and USC contribution crossed Etv1-CreERT2 (layer 5-specific) and Cux2-CreERT2 (layers 2-4) mice with the Cre-dependent MORF3 (mononucleotide repeat frameshift) genetic sparse-labelling mouse line 64 . The MORF3 reporter mouse expresses a farnesylated V5 spaghetti monster fusion protein 65 from the Rosa26 locus when both the LoxP flanked transcriptional STOP sequence is removed by Cre and when stochastic-mononucleotide repeat frameshift occurs 66 . After perfusion, the tissue was cut into 500-µm-thick coronal slices, iDISCO+ cleared 55 with a MORF-optimized protocol, stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-V5 antibody (1:500) followed by AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) and NeuroTrace. Sections were imaged via a 30× silicone oil immersion lens with 1-µm z step on a DragonFly spinning disc confocal microscope (Andor). These tissue generation and processing methods are described in ref. 64 . Composite images of neurons were viewed with

        </p>
        <p>The AIBS contribution crossed Cux2-CreERT2, Fezf2-CreER (layer 5-specific), and Pvalb-T2A-CreERT2 (layer 5) mice with the TIGRE-MORF (Ai166) fluorescent reporter line, which expresses farnesylated EGFP from the TIGRE locus 64 . Following tissue fixation, brains were processed and imaged using the fMOST method. Labelled neurons were reconstructed with 
            <rs type="software">Vaa3D</rs> software in a semi-automated, semi-user defined fashion 68 , using the 
            <rs type="software">TeraFly</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">TeraVR</rs> modules enabling a virtual reality reconstruction environment, and reconstructions were saved as SWC files.
        </p>
        <p>Reconstructions from both datasets were analysed concurrently by the H.-W.D. laboratory. Geometric processing of the reconstructions was performed with the 
            <rs type="software">Quantitative Imaging Toolkit</rs> (
            <rs type="url">http:// cabeen.io/qitwiki)</rs>, allowing us to isolate the basal dendritic tree for analysis, and to render sample visualizations (Extended Data Fig. 17a). The modified SWC files were imported into 
            <rs type="software">NeuTube</rs> and morphometrics were obtained using 
            <rs type="software">L-Measure</rs> 69 . Since tissue preparation and data acquisition techniques can have significant effects on certain morphometric properties 70 , only measures that are insensitive to these effects were used in the present analyses. These measures were number of primary dendrites, remote bifurcation amplitude and tilt angles, branch order, branch path length, tortuosity, arbor depth, height and width, Euclidian distance, total length, partition asymmetry, path distance, terminal degree and terminal segments length. Data outputs were normalized by dividing all values within each dataset by the mean value of all layer 2-4 neurons for each morphometric. Principal component analysis was run on the data, and the first two components were plotted to create a low-dimension scatter plot of the data (Extended Data Fig. 17b). Wilcoxon signed rank tests were applied to all measures comprising the loadings for these two components, with the comparisons made between superficial (2-4) versus deep (5) layers (Extended Data Fig. 17c); for the comparisons reported here the two datasets (AIBS and USC-UCLA) were not pooled together. A Sholl-like analysis was performed on the reconstructions to assess the distribution of dendritic distance as a function of relative path distance from the soma (Extended Data Fig. 17d). Moreover, we carried out a comparative analysis of persistence diagram vectors 71 of superficial versus deep neurons for both datasets (Extended Data Fig. 17e).

        <p>Data analysis. Raw projection barcodes were first normalized by spike-in counts, and further normalized between the two brains so that neurons with non-zero counts in each projection area have the same mean across the two brains. We then performed hierarchical k-means clustering on log-transformed and spike-in corrected projection strengths to identify the major classes. However, this clustering did not identify small clusters with distinct laminar positions. To find subclusters with distinct laminar distributions, we used a second clustering method based on binary projection patterns. From a population of neurons, we first split off one subcluster with a particular binary projection to up to three brain areas. For example, a subcluster can be defined as having projections to the contralateral primary motor cortex, the ipsilateral caudal striatum, but not the caudal medial section of the ipsilateral thalamus. These projections were chosen to maximize the reduction in the entropy of the laminar distribution of neurons. This process was then iterated over the two resulting subclusters, until no subclusters resulted in statistically significant reduction in entropy (P &lt; 0.05 without multiple-testing correction). This process resulted in many clusters, some of which may have similar laminar distributions. We then built a dendrogram based on the distance in projection space among the resulting clusters and iteratively combined subclusters similar in laminar distribution. Two subclusters were considered similar in laminae if differences in their laminar distributions were not statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05 using rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction) and their median laminar positions were within 200 µm. This process was iterated over each split, starting from ones between the closest leaves or branches. We stopped combining clusters at the level of major classes.Data analysis.

        <p>To compare BARseq dataset to single-cell tracing, we randomly down-sampled BARseq dataset to the same sample size as a subset of the single-cell tracing dataset (~160 neurons). We further combined ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas and combined all samples of the same non-isocortex brain divisions together. This resulted in an axonal resolution that can be compared to the single-cell tracing dataset. We then combined this down-sampled and low resolution BARseq dataset with the traced neurons and analysed the joint dataset. t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) was performed in

To test the homogeneity of clusters, we down-sampled the datasets with replacement to different sizes (1,000 random samples per cluster size) and calculated the correlation between the down-sampled cluster centroids to the full-data cluster centroids.

        <p>Whole-brain imaging was performed using a fMOST system. The basic structure of the imaging system is a combination of a wide-field upright epi-fluorescence microscopy with a mechanic sectioning system. This system runs in a wide-field block-face mode but updated to obtain better image contrast and speed and thus enables high throughput imaging of the fluorescent protein-labelled sample (manuscript in preparation). A block-face fluorescence image across the whole coronal plane (xy axes), then the top layer is removed (z axis) with a diamond knife, exposing next layer, and the sample is imaged again, repeating the process. The thickness of each layer is 1.0 µm. In each layer imaging, we used a strip-scanning (x axis) model combined with a montage in the y axis to cover the whole coronal plane 76 . The fluorescence, collected using a microscope objective, passes a bandpass filter and is recorded with a TDI-CCD camera. We repeat these procedures across the whole sample volume to get the required dataset.Whole-brain imaging was performed using a fMOST system.

        <p>Full neuronal morphology reconstruction. This was carried out at AIBS and the SEU-AIBS joint Center. Vaa3D, an open-source, cross-platform visualization and analysis system, was used to reconstruct neuronal morphologies as described in detail recently 77 . Critical modules were developed and incorporated into Vaa3D for efficient handling of the whole-mouse brain fMOST imaging data, that is, Tera-Fly 77 and TeraVR 24 . 
            <rs type="software">TeraFly</rs> supports visualization and annotation of multidimensional imaging data with virtually unlimited scales. The reconstructors can flexibly choose to work at a specific region of interest with the desired level of detail. The out-of-core data management of 
            <rs type="software">TeraFly</rs> allows the software to smoothly deal with terabyte-scale of data even on a portable workstation with normal RAM size. Driven by virtual reality (VR) technologies, 
            <rs type="software">TeraVR</rs> is an annotation tool for immersive neuron reconstruction that has been proved to be critical for achieving precision and efficiency in morphology data production. It creates stereo visualization for image volumes and reconstructions and offers an intuitive interface for the reconstructors to interact with such data. TeraVR excels at handling various challenging yet constantly encountered data situations during whole-brain reconstruction, such as noisy, complicated or weakly labelled axons.

        <p>Trained reconstructors used the Vaa3D suite of tools to complete their reconstructions. Completion was determined typically when all ends had well-labelled, enlarged boutons. A final quality-checking procedure was always performed by at least one more experienced annotator using TeraVR who reviewed the entire reconstruction of a neuron at high magnification, paying special attention to the proximal axonal part or a main axonal trunk of an axon cluster, where axonal collaterals often emerge and branches are more frequently missed due to the local image environment being composed of crowded high contrasting structures. To finalize the reconstruction, an auto-refinement step fit the tracing to the centre of fluorescent signals. The final reconstruction file (SWC) is a single tree without breaks, loops, or multiple branches from a single point.Trained reconstructors used the Vaa3D suite of tools to complete their reconstructions.

We performed 3D registration of each fMOST image series (that is, the subject) to the CCFv3 average template (that is, the target 10 ) using the following steps 9 : (1) fMOST images were down-sampled by 64 × 64 × 16 (x × y × z) to roughly match the size of the target brain; (2) 2D stripe-removal was performed using frequency notch filters; (3) approximately 12 matching landmark pairs between subject and target were manually added to ensure correct affine transformation that approximately aligned the orientation and scales; (4) Affine transformation was applied to minimize the sum of squared difference of intensity between target and subject images; (5) intensity was normalized by matching the local average intensity of subject image to that of target image; (6) a candidate list of landmarks across CCF space was generated by grid search (grid size = 16 pixels); and finally (7) our software searched corresponding landmarks in the subject image and performed local alignment.

Reconstruction and registration outputs were again combined to quantify axon reconstructed for every CCF voxel, and combined for all voxels within the same CCF structure to generate total axon volume per brain structure for each single reconstructed cell. For Fig. 5, we summed voxels from the same structure across hemispheres to match the data format obtained from MouseLight MOp reconstructions, then calculated the fraction of total signal per structure.

Three days later, the mice were induced intraperitoneally with a small amount of tamoxifen (T5648, Sigma, dissolved in corn oil, diluted at a concentration of 5 mg ml -1 , and the injection dose per mouse was 10 g ml -1 ), and the virus was expressed in brain for 5 weeks. The whole-brain images were collected using the fMOST system following similar procedures as described above. The objective used was a 20× water-immersion lens with NA 1.0, to provide a designed optical resolution (at 520 nm) of 0.35 µm in the xy plane. The imaging gives a sample voxel of 0.32 × 0.32 × 1.0 µm to provide proper resolution to trace the neural process. The voxel size can be varied with different objectives.

        <p>We used 
            <rs type="software">BrainsMapi</rs> to complete the 3D registration 80 . Specifically, the image of the red channel was down-sampled to an isotropic 10-µm resolution consistent with the CCFv3. We conduct the registration by several key steps including the initial position correction, regional feature extraction, linear and nonlinear transformation and image warping. Among them, a set of anatomically invariant regional features are extracted manually using

        <p>Some axonal projection analyses were carried out at the laboratory of G.A.A. The brain-wide, single-neuron axonal projections from MOp came from three distinct sources: Janelia MouseLight, fMOST processed and reconstructed at the AIBS, and 
            <rs type="software">fMOST</rs> processed and reconstructed at the SEU-Allen Center in Nanjing. Each reconstruction from all three datasets was provided with a point-by-point reporting of the regions targeted by each neuron. These were the same data analysed in Fig. 5 of the main text. Exclusive-or (XOR) pairwise comparisons were used to quantify the projection differences between two neurons. The targeted regions were then fully shuffled to produce a randomized distribution consistent with the regional projection patterns, corresponding to the 'null' hypothesis of continuous targeting patterns at the single-cell level. The distribution of pairwise XOR distances of the shuffled data was then contrasted with the real pairwise distribution, which enables discernment of how much of the real distribution is accounted for by chance. To this end, given the non-normality of these distributions, we performed a one-tail Levene test 82 to ascertain whether the variance of the experimental distribution was significantly larger than that of the shuffled distribution.

        <p>To estimate the relative proportions of the 10 clusters containing 15 or more neurons, we matched their respective single-cell axonal patterns against the regional patterns from PHA-L anterograde tracing across all target regions. Specifically, the problem is equivalent to a set of constrained, weighted, linear equations that can be solved numerically by standard non-negative least-square (NNLS) or bounded-variable least-squares (BVLS) optimization. The NNLS algorithm solves the linear least squares problem 83 arg minx ||Ax -b||2 with the constraint x ≥ 0. The BVLS variant 84 minimizes the same objective function, but subject to explicit boundary conditions. We used the respective R implementations nnls 85 and bvls 86 . Boundary conditions for bvls were 0.01 for lower bound and 1 for upper bound.

        <p>Extended Data Fig. 3 | Connectivity-based MOp parcellation and projection target defined MOp-ul neuron types. Related to Fig. 1. a, Accuracy of the MOp delineation was further validated using three sets of connectivity data: (1) anterograde axonal projections from the SSp-ul to MOp-ul: transgenic mice (Scnn1a-Tg3-Cre driver line crossed with Ai14 tdTomato reporter line) received an injection of cre-dependent GFP-expressing AAV targeted precisely to the SSp upper limb area (left). Targeting restricted to the SSp was confirmed by the presence of tdTomato fluorescence in SSp layer 4. Analysis using Neuroglancer confirmed the existence of a strong monosynaptic projection from the SSp-ul to MOp-ul, therefore, confirming the border of these two adjacent cortical areas (2nd column of images); (2) the MOp medial border with the MOs was identified by the absence of a monosynaptic MOp connection with the dorsal retrosplenial area (RSPd) and ventrolateral orbital area (ORBvl) and but the presence of strong bidirectional connection between the MOs with both the ORBvl and RSPd3 (the 3rd column of images). b, Detailed distribution patterns of those retrogradely labeled projection neurons in the MOp. Semiquantitative analysis shows distinct laminar specificities of different neuron types with distinct projection targets. Please also see Extended Data Fig. 7 for additional retrograde labeling in bilateral MOp. Taken altogether, IT neurons are distributed broadly across L2-6 37 Individual layers contain intermingled IT neurons innervating different targets, and neurons targeting the same structures can be distributed in different layers (also see Fig. 1e; Extended Data Fig. 7). We identified various IT types: 1) two TEa-projecting types: a L2 type that generates an asymmetric projection pattern with denser innervation to the contralateral TEa, and a L5a type with symmetrical projections to bilateral TEa (also see Extended Data Fig. 7); 2) IT neurons that target other ipsilateral somatic sensorimotor areas (e.g. MOs-ul, SSp-ul, MOs and SSs) are intermingled in layers 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b-middle. These layers also contain dense contralateral MOp-ul PNs and relatively sparse PNs that project to contralateral MOs, SSp and SSs (also see Extended Data Fig. 7a,b); 3) L4 contains many MOsand SSp-projecting neurons, but far fewer SSs-projecting neurons; 4) L6b IT neurons that project to ipsilateral but not contralateral MOs and SSp (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Cortico-striatal projecting IT neurons are distributed preferentially in L5a and 5b-superficial and -middle (also see Extended Data Figs. 7b). ET neurons are distributed primarily in L5b 37 . Some ET neurons display preferential sublaminar patterns, but other types occur in a smoother gradient across sublayers (also Fig. 1e). Neurons projecting to thalamus (parafascicular nucleus, PF), midbrain (anterior pretectal nucleus, APN; superior colliculus, SC), and hindbrain (pontine nuclei) were preferentially distributed in L5b-superficial and -deep; whereas neurons targeting other regions of the midbrain (red nucleus, RN), the medulla (spinal nucleus of trigeminal nerve interpolar part, SPVI), and cervical spinal cord, were preferentially distributed in L5b-middle and -deep, with the deepest L5b labeling resulting from medulla injections (also see Fig. 1e). Additionally, we identified three classes of L6 CT neurons: (1) L6a neurons that primarily project to the posterior thalamic complex (PO), ventral anterior-lateral thalamic complex (VAL), and PF, as well as the reticular thalamus (RT); (2) VM-projecting neurons in L6a deep sublayer and L6b; and (3) L6b neurons that specifically project to the contralateral thalamic nuclei, such as the PO, VAL and VM (also see Fig. 1e). c, Laminar distributions of retrogradely labeled MOp-ul projection neurons after tracer injections into 13 different projection targets (n=2-4 mice per target). TEa projecting neurons are distributed in L2 and L5a; SSp and MOs projecting neurons are distributed throughout L2-6b; contralateral MOp projecting neurons (commissural neurons) are in L3, L5a and L5b; contralateral CP projecting neurons are in L5a and L5b. All of these neurons belong to the intratelencephalic (IT) neuron type. Several PT (pyramidal-tract neurons) or ET (extratelencephalic) type neurons projecting to the PF, SC, pons, medulla, and spinal cord are in L5b, namely the superficial (L5b-s), middle (L5b-m) and deep (L5b-d). Finally, all corticothalamic projecting neurons (CT) are distributed in superficial L6a (VAL-and PO-projecting neurons), as well as deep L6a and L6b (VM-projecting neurons). d, Representative examples of laminar distribution of cell populations from a subset of cre-driver lines (Cux2, Tlx3, Rbp4, Ntsr1, Ctgf, GAD2, VGat, Pv, Snap25, Vglut1, Vglut3, SERT, Fezf2, Tle4 and PlexinD1, n=6-8 mice per line). See Extended Data Fig. 6 for the complete cre-driver lines laminar distribution. c). MOp-ul and SSp-ul project to similar cortical regions (a-e), however they differ in their projections to the thalamus and spinal cord, with SSp-ul uniquely innervating VPL (e, f) and targeting more dorsal layers of spinal cord (l), compared with MOp-ul. In addition, the MOs region just medial to MOp-ul is defined by prominent cortical projections to ORBvl (a, b), RSPd, and PTLp (f), and innervates MD and LP in thalamus (e, f), but lacks a projection to spinal cord (l). Together, these distinct projection profiles demonstrate differences in connectivity that emerge along the medial and lateral borders of MOp-ul. Acronyms are defined in Supplementary Table 1. Scale bars, 1 mm (left panels), 500 µm (right panels, a-l). Please see Supplementary Information for a detailed description of regional output from MOp-ul mapped using PHAL. A given downstream target of MOp-ul was injected with either AAVretro-Cre or RVdGL-Cre and MOp-ul was injected with either AAV1-CAG-FLEX-GFP or AAV1-CAG-FLEX-tdTomato to Cre-dependently label the axonal output for each target-defined population. b, Example images of collateral outputs from different MOp-ul projection neuron types. TEaprojecting neurons ( first two columns) were found mostly in L5a and collateralized to all cortical targets and striatum, but not to thalamus or brainstem, characteristic of the IT cell class. Interestingly, the striatal projection was predominately ipsilateral, while output to TEa/ECT was bilateral and projections to PERI exhibited a contralateral bias. In contrast, contralateral CP-projecting neurons (third column) also exhibited an IT projection profile, however they were found primarily in L5b (perhaps a result of AAVretro viral tropism), and displayed strong bilateral projections to striatum, but very little projection to TEa, ECT, or PERI regions. Ipsilateral CP-projecting neurons ( fourth column) exhibited a similar profile, but also included L5b ET neurons, which project to ipsilateral striatum, as well as thalamus and brainstem regions. Target-defined ET neurons (columns 5-8) broadly collateralized to all other expected targets of this class, except for thalamic-targeting ET cells (column 5, AAVretro-Cre injection in PO labels L5b, but not L6, thalamic projection due to viral tropism) which displayed little or no projection to lateral medulla (e.g. SPVO, last panel in column), while lateral medulla-targeting ET cells (column 8, SPVO) showed little or no projection to thalamus (e.g. PO, fourth panel in column). In addition, all target-defined ET cell populations collateralized to ipsilateral MOs (second row). Lastly, L6 VAL or VM-projecting neurons (columns 9 and 10) co-targeted all other expected thalamic nuclei (PCN, PO, PF) and the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT). No cortical, striatal, or brainstem collaterals were observed, characteristic of the CT cell class. c, Summary of collateral targeting differences for each major cell class. Scale bars, 500 µm (b). Labeled axonal projections are also visible in these sections in the ipsilateral and contralateral CP (CPi, CPc). All other rows, each row shows coronal images at the level of 10 distinct isocortical and subcortical targets of MOp-ul. Anterograde tracing results are strikingly similar across the conventional tracer, PHAL, and AAV-EGFP injected into MOp of wild type mice (first two columns). For some targets (rows) the layer/class origin of the labeled axons in each target is clear. For example, only Cre lines with IT cells project strongly to SSp-ul (Cux2, Rbp4, Tlx3); few to no axons are present in the L5 PT and L6 CT lines. Of note, the hemisphere asymmetry in projections to TEa and PERI is attributable to L2/3 cells, (red boxes in Cux2 column). MOp-ul projections to CEA originate from L5 IT cells (axons labeled in Rbp4 and Tlx3 lines). Ipsilateral VAL projections are strongest in the L6 CT line (Ntsr1), and none of these Cre lines labeled contralateral thalamic projections, although these axons were labeled in both PHAL and wild type AAV tracing experiments. All midbrain projections arise from L5 PT cells (Rbp4, Sim1), as well as the sparse projection to the deep cerebellar nuclei (IP, in Rbp4 panel only). Number of experiments per line and tracer are listed in Fig. 2a (n=1-2; not all experiments were independently repeated as we previously demonstrated n=1 is a good predictor of connectivity strengths across multiple animals). Scale bars = 1 mm in top row panels, 500 µm in all other rows. while axons from SSs and contralateral MOp are distributed diffusely across all layers of MOp-ul. Thalamocortical projections to the MOp-ul more or less follow a rough core/matrix organization described previously for thalamic inputs to primary sensory cortices 37 . In particular, VAL axons generate dense terminals specifically in MOp-ul L4, L5b &amp; L6-a typical "core" type thalamocortical inputs. But, axonal inputs from the PO and PF in the MOp-ul are densely distributed in both L1 (a typical "matrix" type inputs) and L4, thus, a mixture core and matrix pattern. PF axons are further distributed in L6. Inputs from other thalamic nuclei, such as VM, MD, and PCN are diffusely distributed across multiple layers. Based on these results, it is reasonable to anticipate that different PN neuron types (IT, PT, and CT) with their soma and dendritic arbor distributions in different layers may preferentially receive discrete cortical and thalamic inputs at single neuron resolution.Extended Data Fig. 3 | Connectivity-based MOp parcellation and projection target defined MOp-ul neuron types.

Number of experiments per line and tracer are listed in Fig. 2a (n=1-2; not all experiments were independently repeated as we previously demonstrated n=1 is a good predictor of connectivity strengths across multiple animals). Scale bars = 1 mm in top row panels, 500 µm in all other rows. while axons from SSs and contralateral MOp are distributed diffusely across all layers of MOp-ul. Thalamocortical projections to the MOp-ul more or less follow a rough core/matrix organization described previously for thalamic inputs to primary sensory cortices 37 . In particular, VAL axons generate dense terminals specifically in MOp-ul L4, L5b &amp; L6-a typical "core" type thalamocortical inputs. But, axonal inputs from the PO and PF in the MOp-ul are densely distributed in both L1 (a typical "matrix" type inputs) and L4, thus, a mixture core and matrix pattern. PF axons are further distributed in L6. Inputs from other thalamic nuclei, such as VM, MD, and PCN are diffusely distributed across multiple layers. Based on these results, it is reasonable to anticipate that different PN neuron types (IT, PT, and CT) with their soma and dendritic arbor distributions in different layers may preferentially receive discrete cortical and thalamic inputs at single neuron resolution.</p>

Local morphometric features of MOp neurons across layers. a, Examples of reconstructed cells within MOp cortical layers 2/3/4 (orange) and 5 (blue) (see Methods). Note some L4-5 Cux2/ Etv1 neurons lack an apical branch. The total neurons reconstructed for each mouse strain are: MORF3 (@UCLA/USC) x Cux2-CreERT2 (n=9) or Etv1-CreERT2 (n=36); TIGRE-MORF (@AIBS) x Cux2-CreERT2 (n=16), Fezf2-CreERT2 (n=3), or Pvalb-Cre (n=4). b, Principal component analysis (PCA) shows segregation of MOp layer-specific neurons based on measured morphological features. c, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were run (all parameters survived the false discovery rate correction) and group differences between layers 2/3/4 and 5 basal dendritic trees of UCLA/USC (L2-4 [n=11], L5 [n=34]) and AIBS (L2-4 [n=16], L5 [n=7]) cases separately are presented in whisker plots and the degree of their significance is indicated by stars. d, Sholl-like analysis comparing basal dendritic patterns in MOp layer 5 and layers 2/3/4 neurons. The distribution of normalized dendritic length is plotted against the relative path distance from the soma. The graph shows that dendrites of neurons within layer 5 of MOp have slightly larger dendritic length closer to the cell body compared to the dendrites of layers 2/3/4 neurons. e, Persistence-based neuronal feature vectorization was also applied to summarize pairwise differences between superficial and deep neurons for UCLA/USC and AIBS datasets independently.

Extended Data Fig. 14 | Schematic summaries of MOp-ul outputs by area (PHAL) and for different cell types revealed with cre-dependent AAV tracing in different cre mouse lines on a whole brain flatmap of the rodent brain5 (also see Swanson, Brainmap 4.0 in http://larrywswanson. com/?page_id=1415). Related to Fig. 2. These data shows that each of the MOp cell types (L2/3 IT, L4 IT, L5 IT, L5 ET/PT, L6 CT) display a discrete subset of MOp projections. Please note that these results also showed MOp-ul axons targeting several previously unreported areas, e.g., the capsular central amygdalar nucleus (CEAc), bed nucleus of the anterior commissure (BAC), globus pallidus external segment (GPe), contralateral thalamic nuclei (PCN), and cerebellar interposed nucleus (IP; Suppl. Information). Further analyses of the connectivity matrix (Source Data Fig. 2, formatted matrix tab) and images (Extended Data Fig. 12) reveal the predominant PN types constituting new and established MOp-ul output channels (also see Fig. 2d). For example, projections to SSp-ul originate from both L2/3 and L5 IT neurons labeled in the Cux2-L2/3, Rbp4-L5 and Tlx3-L5 populations. Projections to CEAc arise from L5 IT cells (Rbp4-L5 and Tlx3-L5, also see Extended Data Fig. 12), and projections to GPe are primarily from ET cells (Rbp4-L5, Fezf2-L5, Foxp2-L6, Sim1-L5). Anterograde experiments also confirmed (in Cux2-L2/3) the population of L2 neurons projecting contralaterally to TEa, ECT, and PERI identified by retrograde tracing (see Extended Data Fig. 7), and a Tle4-L6 CT projection to contralateral thalamic nuclei. Moreover, the sparse cerebellar projection to the IP nucleus we observed with PHAL, AAV-GFP, and AAV1-Cre anterograde monosynaptic tracing is also labeled in Rbp4-L5, but not other ET lines (Source Data Fig. 2, Extended Data Fig. 12).The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03970-w.

        <p>This study focuses on characterizing inputs/outputs of the primary motor cortex upper limb area (MOp-ul) using different tracing methods. Each of tracer injections were repeated multiple times in different animals. While the best, most representative cases were chosen for inclusion in the analysis data set, the other injections served as validation cases, demonstrating the replicability and consistency of tracer labeling.This study focuses on characterizing inputs/outputs of the primary motor cortex upper limb area (MOp-ul) using different tracing methods.
