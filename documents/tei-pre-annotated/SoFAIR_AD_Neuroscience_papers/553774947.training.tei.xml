        <p>Understanding how cortical circuits generate complex behavior requires investigating the cell types that comprise them. Functional differences across pyramidal neuron (PyN) types have been observed within cortical areas, but it is not known whether these local differences extend throughout the cortex, nor whether additional differences emerge when larger-scale dynamics are considered. We used genetic and retrograde labeling to target pyramidal tract, intratelencephalic and corticostriatal projection neurons and measured their cortex-wide activity. Each PyN type drove unique neural dynamics, both at the local and cortex-wide scales. Cortical activity and optogenetic inactivation during an auditory decision task revealed distinct functional roles. All PyNs in parietal cortex were recruited during perception of the auditory stimulus, but, surprisingly, pyramidal tract neurons had the largest causal role. In frontal cortex, all PyNs were required for accurate choices but showed distinct choice tuning. Our results reveal that rich, cell-type-specific cortical dynamics shape perceptual decisions.</p>
        <p>The neocortex is organized into discrete layers that form a conserved microcircuit motif. Each layer consists of distinct cell types that can be categorized by genetic markers, morphology, anatomical projections or developmental lineage 1 . The precise interplay across cell types is crucial for cortical computations and their functional roles are intensely studied. For cortical interneurons, cell-type-specific mouse lines have enabled tremendous progress and revealed the functional arrangement of inhibitory circuit motifs [2][3][4] , for example, for network synchronization [5][6][7] and state-dependent sensory processing [8][9][10][11] . However, the roles of glutamatergic PyN types are less well established, although PyNs make up ~80% of all cortical neurons and form almost all long-range projections that enable the communication between cortex and other brain areas.</p>
        <p>While often treated as a monolithic group, PyNs are far more diverse than interneurons. RNA sequencing indicates at least 100 putative subtypes that are often intermingled within the same layers [12][13][14][15][16][17] . PyNs are also broadly categorized into two major types based on their long-range projections: intratelencephalic (IT) neurons project to other cortical areas and the striatum, while pyramidal tract (PT) neurons project to subcortical structures, such as the pons and thalamus. PT and IT neurons also differ in their electrophysiological properties, dendritic arborization, local connectivity and sensory tuning [15][16][17] . Moreover, only PT neurons in sensory cortex are required for perception of tactile or visual stimuli, suggesting that PT and IT neurons encode separate streams of information 18,19 . Correspondingly, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>Next, we tested if spatial sNMF components, representing cortex-wide maps of positively correlated areas, were PyN-type specific. Indeed, components from different mice of the same PyN type strongly resembled each other but differed from other PyN types (Fig. 2b). To assess if most components were PyN-type specific, we performed a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis of the first 20 components from all recordings, nonlinearly embedding the pixels of each component in a two-dimensional space (Fig. 2c) 35 . In agreement with the notion that components of the same PyN type resembled each other, PT and IT components formed strong clusters (green/blue markers). EMX neurons formed a third set of nonoverlapping clusters, likely reflecting the combined cortical dynamics from diverse PyN types beyond PT and IT neurons (red markers).</p>
        <p>A simple classifier reliably identified each group, based on the nearest neighbors in a UMAP projection using data from other animals. Remarkably, even single-component classification achieved very high prediction accuracy, although components were pooled over many sessions and mice (Fig. 2d). UMAP clusters therefore reflect consistent PyN-type-specific activity patterns, rather than idiosyncratic differences or noise. These results clearly demonstrate that PyN types differ in the complexity of cortical dynamics, contain independent variance and exhibit unique cortex-wide correlation patterns.</p>
        <p>An important concern is that nonuniform Cre expression could contribute to PyN-specific spatial components. However, in vivo GCaMP-related fluorescence was largely uniform, with no clear relationship between widefield fluorescence or PyN-type-specific spatial components and Cre expression patterns (Extended Data Fig. 2). Nevertheless, particularly distinct PyN-type activity in specific cortical areas could lead to cortex-wide correlation patterns either that are dominated by highly active areas or where inactive areas are 'missing'. We therefore used localized sNMF (LocaNMF) 33 , which extracts components that are restricted to a specific cortical 'seed' region (Fig. 2e). Analyzing LocaNMF components therefore allowed us to reveal if PyN-specific differences mostly occur on a cortex-wide level (reflecting the interactions between cortical areas) or extend to specific properties of local cortical areas (reflecting PyN-type-specific differences in the shape or localization of individual areas).</p>
        <p>The number of LocaNMF components was greater than sNMF and, interestingly, more similar across PyN types (Fig. 2f). PyN-type-specific differences in cortex-wide correlation patterns are therefore not due to low activity in specific cortical areas (which would reduce the total number of required components, for example, in PT mice) but reflect differences in the coordinated activation of multi-area cortical networks. UMAP embedding of LocaNMF components also uncovered PyN-type-specific clustering (Fig. 2g), which accurately identified each PyN type across most cortical regions (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 2d). PyN-type specificity of LocaNMF components could indicate either specific 'subregions', where PyN types are most active in smaller parts of a given cortical area, or larger 'superregions', where PyN-type-specific activity extends across area borders. We compared the size of LocaNMF components that accurately predicted their respective PyN type (classifier accuracy &gt; 99%) versus nonspecific components. Interestingly, PyN-predictive components were significantly smaller than nonspecific components (Fig. 2i), suggesting that different PyNs might be most active in distinct subregions instead of larger multi-area components. This indicates that smaller, PyN-type-specific subregions may reside within the coarser, traditionally defined cortical areas.</p>
        <p>We next assessed functional PyN-type-specific cortical dynamics by imaging animals during auditory decision-making (Fig. 3a) 36 . Mice touched small handles, triggering the simultaneous presentation of click sequences to their left side and right side. After a delay, choosing one of two water spouts was rewarded when licking on the side where specific PT neurons in secondary motor cortex (M2) are involved in motor generation 13,20 . The functional divergence of PyN types could therefore be key for understanding cortical microcircuits, with PT and IT neurons forming functionally distinct, parallel subnetworks that independently process different information. However, the functional tuning of individual PyNs in frontal cortex remains best predicted by cortical area location instead of laminar location or projection type 21 . Because PyN-type-specific activity has only been studied in single areas, it is therefore not known whether PyN-specific subcircuits are the rule or the exception across cortical areas.</p>
        <p>An ideal method to address this question is widefield calcium imaging, allowing neural measures across the dorsal cortex with cell-type specificity [22][23][24] . Interneuron-specific widefield imaging revealed distinct spatiotemporal dynamics for different inhibitory cell types during an odor detection task 25 . However, cortex-wide studies of different PyN types are lacking, partly due to the limited availability of PyN-specific driver lines [26][27][28] . Here, we used two novel knock-in lines 26 and measured cortex-wide PT or IT activity while animals performed a perceptual decision-making task. Moreover, we used retrograde labeling to measure the activity of corticostriatal (CStr) projection neurons throughout the dorsal cortex. Dimensionality-reduction and clustering analyses revealed unique cortex-wide dynamics for each PyN type, suggesting the existence of specialized subcircuits. Cortical dynamics of different PyNs were further segregated based on their role in decision-making, with encoder and decoder approaches revealing the strongest stimulus-related and choice-related modulation in sensory, parietal and frontal cortices. This was confirmed by PyN-type-specific inactivation experiments. In parietal cortex, PT neurons were most important for sensory processing, while all PyN types in frontal cortex were needed for choice formation and retention. Taken together, our results demonstrate that different PyN types exhibit functionally distinct, cortex-wide neural dynamics with separate roles during perceptual decision-making.</p>
        <p>We used CreER lines to measure the activity of two developmentally distinct PyN types: Fezf2-CreER targeting PT neurons and PlexinD1-CreER targeting IT neurons 26 , crossed with Ai162 mice 29 to achieve PyN-type-specific expression of the calcium indicator GCaMP6s. As expected for corticofugal PT neurons, GCaMP expression in Fezf2 mice was concentrated in layer 5b with axonal projections to subcortical regions and the corticospinal tract (Fig. 1a). In PlexinD1 mice, expression was restricted to layers 2/3 and 5a with axonal projections in the corpus callosum and the striatum, matching intracortical and corticostriatal IT neurons (Fig. 1b).</p>
        <p>We then measured PyN-type-specific cortical activity with widefield imaging. In both lines, we observed rich neural dynamics across cortex (Supplementary Videos 1-3) and retinotopic mapping revealed known visual area locations (Fig. 1c) 30,31 . Retinotopic maps were similar to those in Ai93D;Emx-Cre;LSL-tTA (EMX) mice with nonspecific GCaMP6f expression across PyNs 32 , suggesting that the functional architecture of visual areas is comparable across PyN types. However, the variance of cortical activity was clearly PyN-type specific, being largest in parietal and frontal regions in PT neurons, and visual and somatosensory regions in IT neurons (Fig. 1d). Variance maps were also highly consistent across individual mice in the same group (Extended Data Fig. 1a), indicating PyN-type-specific differences in cortex-wide activity patterns. To isolate activity patterns, we therefore performed semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (sNMF), reducing the imaging data to a small number of spatial and temporal components that capture &gt;99% of all variance 23,33 . Surprisingly, PT neurons had a lower dimension than IT neurons (Fig. 2a), potentially because IT neurons encompass a larger number of specialized subtypes than PT neurons and thus support a wider range of functions 34 .</p>
        <p>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9 more clicks were presented. To reduce temporal correlations across task events, the durations of the initiation, stimulus and delay periods were randomly varied across trials. In all mice, decisions varied systematically with stimulus strength (Fig. 3b) and were equally affected by clicks throughout the stimulus period (Extended Data Fig. 3a).</p>
        <p>Trial-averaged temporal sNMF and LocaNMF components also showed pronounced clustering, suggesting that PyN types exhibit unique task-related temporal dynamics (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Correspondingly, trial-averaged neural activity between PyN types was clearly distinct, especially during stimulus presentation when EMX activity was uniformly suppressed, IT activity was partially suppressed in somatosensory and visual cortex, and PT activity was uniformly elevated (Fig. 3c,d). Cortical activity was largely symmetric between hemispheres, even when only analyzing trials where both stimuli and subsequent choices were leftward (Extended Data Fig. 4). Moreover, stimulus responses were much weaker than movement-related activity, such as trial initiation or licking (Fig. 3d). Lateralized, task-related activity could have therefore been obscured by cortical activity due to animal movements 32,[37][38][39] .</p>
        <p>To isolate task-related activity, we used a linear encoding model, combining many task-related and movement-related variables (Supplementary Table 1) to predict single-trial fluctuations in cortical activity (Fig. 4a) 32 . Task variables included sensory stimuli, and past and current choices. Movement variables included licking, handle touch or facial movements (see Methods for a complete variable list). After combining all variables and fitting the model, we obtained time-varying event kernels, showing how each variable (for example, the sensory stimulus) relates to cortical activity. This allowed us to separate task-related and movement-related activity.</p>
        <p>To assess the accuracy of model predictions, we computed the cross-validated explained variance (cvR 2 ). Across PyNs, the model captured a large fraction of single-trial variance throughout dorsal cortex (Fig. 4b) and, consistent with earlier results 32,37 , movements captured more variance than task variables (Fig. 4c). We then focused on the event kernels for stimulus and choice, to reveal their respective PyN-type-specific cortical dynamics. To ensure that stimulus and choice accounted for a sizable amount of the neural activity, we computed the variance that each kernel contributed to the full model compared to the sum of all movement variables (Fig. 4d). While movement variables made the largest model contributions (~60% explained variance), both stimulus and choice also made sizable contributions (10-20% explained variance). Stimulus and choice therefore remain important for understanding cortical activity patterns and can be leveraged to selectively isolate task-related activity.</p>
        <p>We first investigated responses to the auditory stimulus. In contrast to trial averages of ΔF/F (Fig. 3c), EMX stimulus kernels uncovered lateralized responses in auditory, parietal and frontal cortex while somatosensory and visual cortex, were inhibited (Figs. 4a and5a). Sensory-locked responses were also present in auditory, parietal and frontal cortices of PT and IT mice but no inhibition was apparent in PT mice. Sensory responses were particularly PyN-type-specific in the parietal cortex: EMX and IT responses were localized in area A, while PT responses were most prominent at the border between areas AM and RS (Fig. 5b). While some areas, such as auditory cortex, preferentially responded to contralateral stimuli, PT neurons in parietal cortex were activated bilaterally in response to ipsilateral or contralateral stimuli. To assess such side-specificity, we subtracted ipsilateral from contralateral stimulus kernels (Fig. 5c). EMX responses were lateralized in auditory, frontal, and to a lesser extent parietal cortex (Fig. 5c,d). Lateralized IT responses were found in auditory and parietal but not frontal cortex. In contrast, PT responses were lateralized in auditory and frontal but not in parietal cortex. Such differences in unilateral versus bilateral responses in PT and IT neurons may also reflect divergent functional roles, with unilateral responses encoding the spatial location of sensory information and bilateral responses representing stimulus salience.</p>
        <p>Having identified PyN-type-specific sensory responses, we then examined choice-dependent activity and again observed clear differences across PyN types. In EMX mice, choice-related activity was strongest in the frontal cortex, while sensory and parietal regions were only weakly modulated (Fig. 6a). We also found choice signals in whiskers and nose somatosensory areas that slowly increased during the trial (Extended Data Fig. 5a), potentially because of subtle, choice-predictive whisker or facial movements 40 . In contrast, frontal choice-specific activity strongly increased after stimulus onset and remained elevated into the delay period (Fig. 6a). While PT neurons showed similarly robust choice signals, there was little evidence of IT choice activity (Fig. 6b https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). In EMX and PT mice, positive contralateral choice signals were concentrated in the medial M2 with some inhibition in primary motor cortex (M1). This could indicate accumulation of sensory evidence and motor preparation in M2, and inhibition in parts of M1 when early lick responses must be witheld 41 .</p>
        <p>Although choice kernels revealed PyN-type-specific differences, they only accounted for a small amount of the total neural variance (Fig. 4d). Because the encoding model maximizes explained variance, we hypothesized that it might miss specific but low-magnitude choice signals. To isolate all choice-related activity, we therefore used a logistic https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9 regression classifier with L1 penalty. In contrast to the encoding model, this decoder approach isolates cortical signals that are best suited to predict choices, regardless of their magnitude. Across PyNs, the decoder predicted trial-by-trial choices with high accuracy (Extended Data Fig. 5d). When analyzing the decoder weights, we found comparable patterns to the encoding model's choice kernels but with much clearer separation of cortical areas (compare the top row for 'Delay' in Fig. 6c to left of Fig. 6a). Here, positive decoder weights denote areas that are most predictive for contralateral choices but, importantly, this does not suggest that these areas are necessarily the most active. We found substantial choice signals in multiple areas of the anterior cortex that evolved during decisions (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Figs. 5e and6). In EMX and PT mice (top and bottom rows), large parts of M2 were again highly choice predictive, including the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and the medial motor cortex (MM) 21 . M2 choice weights strongly increased immediately after stimulus onset and remained elevated during the subsequent delay period (Fig. 6c,d). Additionally, cortical choice signals persisted after removing movement-related activity from the data, suggesting that they are not explained by choice-predictive animal movements but instead reflect the formation of sensory-driven decisions in frontal cortex (Extended Data Fig. 7).</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, we also found a mild ipsilateral choice preference for M2 in IT mice, despite strong bilateral activation of frontal cortex during the delay period (Fig. 3c). Ipsilateral choice signals evolved more slowly during the stimulus and delay periods (Fig. 6c,d) and were spatially restricted to the ALM (Fig. 6e). No choice signals were seen in parietal cortex of any PyN type (Fig. 6d), suggesting that parietal cortex is mostly involved in sensory processing instead of choice formation or motor execution 42,43 .</p>
        <p>The decoder recovered fine-structured choice maps, especially in frontal cortex, revealing contralateral and ipsilateral choice signals in PT and IT mice, respectively. This unexpected inversion could be due to different choice selectivity of specific IT subtypes: intracortical versus CStr projection neurons. Earlier work suggested an even distribution of ipsilateral and contralateral choice selectivity in frontal intracortical projection neurons 20,21 . We thus hypothesized that IT choice selectivity is shaped by CStr neurons. To address this, we developed a retrograde labeling approach by injecting CAV-2-Cre in reporter mice to induce widespread expression of GCaMP6s in CStr neurons (Fig. 7a,b).</p>
        <p>Using widefield imaging, we observed robust CStr-related fluorescence (Supplementary Video 5) and identified visual areas using retinotopic mapping (Extended Data Fig. 8a). sNMF showed that the dimensionality of CStr mice was intermediate between PT and IT activity, with spatial components forming independent clusters from other PyN types (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). The clear difference between IT and CStr mice suggests that IT dynamics represent a mixture of intracortical-projecting and corticostriatal-projecting IT neurons with distinct activity patterns.</p>
        <p>Trial-averaged CStr activity during the auditory task partially resembled IT activity (for example, in frontal cortex) but also showed clear differences, such as a lack of pre-stimulus suppression in sensory cortex (Fig. 7c,d). CStr and IT mice also differed in their respective stimulus kernels: stimulus-related CStr activity in parietal cortex was stronger than in sensory and frontal cortex but the peak parietal activity was more medial compared to IT mice (Fig. 7e). Interestingly, the location of stimulus-driven parietal regions (Fig. 7f) closely resembled the anatomical and functional topography to the dorsomedial striatum 44,45 . As with PT neurons (Fig. 5b,d), parietal CStr responses were similar for contralateral and ipsilateral stimulation (Fig. 7f).</p>
        <p>To determine if CStr activity contributed to ipsilateral-preferring IT choice signals, we used the decoder that predicted choices with equally high accuracy as for PT and IT mice (Extended Data Fig. 8d). We then extracted choice weights for each task episode. CStr activity was overall similar to IT mice, with an even stronger ipsilateral choice preference in frontal cortex that started after stimulus onset and lasted throughout the delay and response periods (Fig. 7g). This inversion from contralateral to ipsilateral choice preference was again prominent in ALM but did not extend to MM, strongly suggesting that ipsilateral choice preference is driven by IT-CStr neurons.</p>
        <p>To confirm these results at cellular resolution, we recorded all PyNs in frontal cortex with two-photon calcium imaging and identified https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>CStr neurons through retrograde viral labeling (Fig. 7i). Comparing the choice tuning of CStr and unlabeled PyNs revealed a specific difference in ipsilateral versus contralateral choice preference in the ALM (Fig. 7j). Most choice-selective CStr neurons preferred ipsilateral choices, whereas unlabeled PyNs were mildly contra-selective (Fig. 7k).</p>
        <p>In agreement with our widefield results, these differences were seen in the ALM but not the MM. Interestingly, ipsilateral choice preference was restricted to superficial IT-CStr neurons (cortical depth, 200-400 µm). Infragranular CStr neurons (400-600 µm), which are also often PT cells 17 , showed strong contralateral choice tuning (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Lastly, we tested if neuropil choice signals may have masked somatic activity in our widefield measures. Neuropil largely resembled somatic choice tuning of unlabeled neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9b), confirming that PyN-type-specific widefield measures indeed represented local somatic activity. Here, IT-specific widefield signals matched the mixed choice-selectivity of superficial layers, while PT-specific imaging was well aligned with the clear contralateral choice tuning in deeper cortical layers.</p>
        <p>The observed differences between PyNs suggest that each type may drive distinct aspects of decision-making. To causally test their functional role, we performed PyN-type-specific optogenetic inactivation in auditory, parietal and frontal cortex, using the inhibitory opsin stG-tACR2 (ref. 46 ; Fig. 8a,b). For CStr neurons, we used an intersectional approach to maximize the efficiency of retrograde expression and reduce potential viral tropism 47 . Cortical inactivation coordinates were determined from our stimulus and choice analyses (Figs. 5a and6a).</p>
        <p>To test whether optogenetic effects are area specific, we also targeted the primary visual cortex (V1) in a subset of EMX mice.</p>
        <p>As expected, decision accuracy was impaired by bilateral silencing of EMX neurons in auditory, parietal or frontal cortex but unaffected by silencing V1 (Fig. 8c). We then inactivated each area for 0.5 s during four different task episodes: early and late stimulus (the first and last 0.5 s of the stimulus), delay and response (Fig. 8d). Consistent with the notion that auditory and parietal cortex reflect stimulus-driven activity (Fig. 5a), silencing either area strongly impaired task performance, particularly during the stimulus period (Fig. 8e,f). Behavioral impairments (the normalized difference between performance in non-optogenetic trials and chance) were weaker during the subsequent periods, indicating that these areas are most important for early processing of auditory stimuli.</p>
        <p>Consistent with earlier work 48 , silencing CStr neurons in A1 impaired auditory decisions (Fig. 8e). However, the effects were more transient and weaker compared to silencing EMX neurons, suggesting that CStr neurons were not exclusively required for accurate task performance. Inactivating IT or CStr neurons in parietal cortex caused surprisingly mild effects, while silencing PT neurons robustly impaired performance (Fig. 8f). This indicates that subcortical PT projection from parietal cortex are more important for sensory processing than intracortical IT or CStr projections, suggesting a role for PT neurons beyond movement preparation and execution.</p>
        <p>Frontal inactivations resulted in the strongest impairment, with IT and CStr inactivation causing similar effects during the stimulus and delay periods (Fig. 8g). Impairments in IT mice are therefore not solely due to the disruption of intracortical processing 20 but also involve alterations of CStr neurons. Inactivating PT neurons equally impaired performance during the stimulus and delay period but showed stronger effects during the final response period. Impairments in the response period were similar for EMX and PT mice, suggesting that PT neurons are particularly involved in licking responses. Multiple PyN types in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>frontal cortex are therefore involved in the formation and maintenance of choices, despite clear differences in their respective choice tuning. Lastly, we also analyzed licking patterns to test if optogenetic inhibition broadly disrupted animal movements. Frontal inactivation in the delay period had a mild effect on response latency but did not affect response probability or licking patterns, arguing against a strong motor impairment (Extended Data Fig. 10). PyN-type-specific inhibition therefore selectively reduced the animals' response accuracy rather than broadly disrupting their ability for movement initiation and execution.</p>
        <p>We measured and manipulated PyN types to determine whether they play distinct roles in decision-making. Cortex-wide activity patterns were PyN-type specific, each reflecting distinct neural dynamics at multiple spatial scales. Functional specificity across PyN types was also evident during decision-making: each PyN type exhibited unique cortical localization and specificity associated with stimulus and choice. These response patterns were not seen when imaging from PyNs nonspecifically. PyN-type-specific optogenetic inactivation confirmed distinct functional roles in parietal and frontal cortex, highlighting the importance of subcortical projections for decision formation. Our results suggest that different PyN types are functionally distinct, and perform separate roles during auditory decision-making. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>Dimensionality reduction of cortical dynamics 33,49,50 revealed that nearly all spatial components were PyN-type specific. Large-scale activity patterns are therefore shaped by PyN-specific dynamics. This has important implications for studies of cortex-wide neural dynamics, which are often based on nonspecific measures of neural activity [51][52][53][54] . Earlier work revealed functional modules that span the entire cortex 49,[53][54][55][56] and follow intracortical connectivity patterns 57,58 . Our results point to the existence of additional, PyN-type-specific motifs, especially for subcortical projections, such as PT or CStr neurons. Furthermore, most PyN-specific LocaNMF components consisted of spatially precise subregions that were smaller than classic cortical areas. Future studies could reveal even more detailed cortical structures by combining large-scale measures of multiple PyN types with multicolor widefield imaging 24,59 and observing interactions between PyN-specific cortical dynamics within the same animal.</p>
        <p>We also observed unique sensory response patterns for each PyN type. This is in line with recent results from primary somatosensory 18,60 and visual cortex 19 , arguing that different PyN types play separate roles during sensory processing. The clear differences in magnitude, localization and lateralization of sensory responses in parietal and frontal cortex demonstrate that the functional specialization of different PyN types is a general feature of cortical circuit function. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>Correspondingly, we found diverse behavioral effects when inactivating PyN types. Consistent with earlier work, inactivating CStr neurons in auditory cortex impaired task performance 48 , suggesting that corticostriatal projections are important for sensory perception. Inactivating parietal cortex also caused strong behavioral impairments during sensory stimulation but not when silencing CStr or IT neurons. This shows that the importance of CStr projections does not generalize from auditory to parietal cortex and also argues against models in which sensory information is intracortically transmitted from parietal to frontal cortex during decision formation 42,61,62 . Instead, silencing parietal PT neurons during the stimulus presentation strongly disrupted decisions, highlighting the importance of subcortical projections for decision-making 63 .</p>
        <p>These results are at odds with earlier studies in rats, showing little or no impact of parietal inactivation on auditory performance 64,65 . Conversely, other work in head-fixed mice reported robust impairments in visual 43,[66][67][68] and auditory 62 tasks. This could be due to differences between rats and mice or the precise location of parietal inactivation. Sensory modalities are processed along a mediolateral gradient in parietal cortex, emphasizing the need to precisely target specific parietal areas to obtain a modality-specific behavioral effect 62 . Our task also requires evidence accumulation and working memory, which engage a wider range of cortical regions and could explain the involvement of parietal cortex for accurate decisions 67 .</p>
        <p>The accumulation and memory requirements might also explain why we found clear cortical choice signals, whereas recent cortex-wide studies reported little choice selectivity 39,69 . The lack of side-specific choice tuning in IT populations matches earlier work, showing that intracortical projections in ALM equally include contralateral and ipsilateral choice-preferring cells 20,21 . In contrast, CStr populations were more selective for ipsilateral choices and we confirmed that this was also present in individual CStr neurons. PyN-specific widefield signals therefore selectively reflect somatic activity and not just superficial neuropil signals. Ipsilateral choice signals in CStr neurons were restricted to superficial ALM, which is mostly implicated in movement generation 13,70 . A recent study showed that CStr projections from the anterior cingulate cortex inhibit striatal activity and motor behavior 71 . Ipsilateral choice tuning of CStr neurons could therefore serve to disinhibit striatal circuits when releasing a targeted licking response.</p>
        <p>Frontal inactivation strongly impaired animal behavior during the stimulus and delay periods, suggesting an important role for the translation of sensory inputs into behavior 21,69,[72][73][74] . Impairments were largely similar across frontal PyN types, which appear to be equally required for choice formation and retention. Frontal PyNs may thus be more reliant on each other to maintain accurate function than in sensory areas 18,19,48 . As the only exception, PT neurons were more important during the response period, consistent with a specific role of brainstem-projecting PT neurons for motor execution 13 .</p>
        <p>Our work offers a new perspective on cortex-wide dynamics by viewing them through the lens of different PyN types and strongly supports the view that cortical circuits perform parallel computations, even within the same cortical layer 13,18,19,75 . Future work to reveal how cortical circuits generate behavior should therefore include PyN types to resolve the heterogeneity that is often encountered when studying cortical decision circuits. A powerful tool to achieve this goal are novel mouse lines, such as inducible knock-in lines that permit reliable targeting of PT and IT neurons. These mouse lines https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9 also overcome several earlier problems, such as unstable expression patterns or cell-type mixtures due to interactions with surrounding genetic elements 26,76 . Moreover, combining genetic mouse lines with retrograde labeling will enable the targeting of specific PyN subtypes, such as projection-specific PT neurons 12,13 , that might serve a large array of functions from sensory processing, to working memory and motor function 13,18 .</p>

        <p>All surgical and behavioral procedures conformed to the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Mice were 8-to 25-week-old males (Supplementary Table 2). No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes but sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 22,25 . Mouse strains were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory, Allen Brain Institute, or generated at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>
        <p>The mouse room had a relative humidity of 30-70%, and a room temperature of 69-78 °F. Transgenic strains crossed to generate double-and triple-transgenic mice used for imaging were: Emx-Cre ( JAX 005628), LSL-tTA ( JAX 008600), Ai93D ( JAX 024103), Ai162 ( JAX 031562), TRE-GCaMP6s (G6s2, JAX 024742) and H2B-eGFP ( JAX 006069; Supplementary Table 3). EMX mice, used for calcium imaging, were bred as Ai93D;Emx-Cre;LSL-tTA. To avoid potential aberrant cortical activity patterns, EMX mice were on a doxycycline (DOX)-containing diet, preventing GCaMP6s expression until they were 6 weeks or older 22,25 .</p>
        <p>For widefield imaging of PT and IT neurons, inducible knock-in drivers Fezf2-2A-CreER and PlexinD1-2A-CreER, respectively, were crossed with Ai162 reporter mice to drive cortex-wide GCaMP6s expression. Cre expression was induced through two doses of intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen (200 mg per kg body weight; 20 mg ml -1 corn oil solution) at postnatal day (P) 28 and P32, yielding expression patterns consistent with prior reports 26 . For widefield imaging of corticostriatal neurons, we crossed Ai162 with G6s2 to create a double-transgenic reporter strain Ai162;G6s2 with two hemizygous copies of GCaMP6s under tetO control. Because LSL-tTA is incorporated in tandem with the reporter gene in the Ai162 strain 29 , this hybrid reporter line permits Cre-dependent expression of GCaMP6s at higher levels than Ai162 hemizygotes while avoiding potential leaky reporter gene expression. To achieve widespread GCaMP6s expression in corticostriatal neurons, we performed striatal injections of retrograde virus (CAV-2-Cre) in the hybrid Ai162;G6s2 reporter line (see 'Viral injections'). For two-photon imaging, GCaMP6s expression in PyNs was generated using the hybrid strain Camk2α-tTA;G6s2.</p>
        <p>Surgeries were performed under 1-2% isoflurane in oxygen anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, 1.2 mg per kg body weight meloxicam was injected subcutaneously and sterile lidocaine ointment was applied topically to the skin incision site. After making a midline cranial incision, the skin was retracted laterally and fixed in position with tissue adhesive (Vetbond, 3M). We then built an outer wall using dental cement (C&amp;B Metabond, Parkell; Ortho-Jet, Lang Dental) along the lateral edge of the dorsal cranium (frontal and parietal bones). A custom titanium skull post was then attached to the dental cement. For skull clearing, the skull was thoroughly cleaned followed by the application of a thin layer of cyanoacrylate (Zap-A-Gap CA+, Pacer technology) 23 .</p>
        <p>For two-photon imaging, a circular craniotomy (ø = 3 mm) over the right frontal cortex (1.75 mm lateral and 1.75 mm rostral to bregma), was made using a biopsy punch. A circular coverslip (ø = 3 mm) was then lowered to the surface of the brain and sealed to the skill with Vetbond and Metabond. Lastly, a titanium skull post was implanted as described above.</p>
        <p>After induction with isoflurane anesthesia, animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Injections were made using a programmable nanoliter injector (Nanoject III, Drummond Scientific). For widefield imaging of CStr mice, widespread corticostriatal GCaMP6s expression was generated in Ai162;G6s2 reporter mice by performing bilateral stereotaxic injections of CAV-2-Cre (at 3-4 weeks of age) into the dorsal striatum at three targets per hemisphere, spanning the rostrocaudal (RC) axis. The target coordinates (relative to bregma and dura, in mm) are: (1) RC + 0.75, mediolateral (ML) ± 1.8, dorsoventral (DV) 3.0; (2) RC 0, ML ± 2.2, DV 3.1; (3) RC -0.75, ML ± 2.9, DV 3.1. For each striatal target, a burr hole was created using a small dental burr followed by injection of 1.8 × 10 9 purified particles (pp) of CAV-2-Cre using pipettes with long taper tips pulled from borosilicate capillaries (3.5 inch, 3-000-203-G/X, Drummond Scientific). For two-photon imaging experiments, CStr neurons were labeled through striatal injections of AAV-2-retro-CAG-tdTomato (using the same approach and coordinates as described above) in Camk2α-tTA;G6s2 mice.</p>
        <p>For cell-type-specific optogenetic silencing experiments, we performed bilateral injections in frontal, parietal and auditory cortices (coordinates relative to bregma: frontal: RC + 2.5 mm, ML ± 1.5 mm; parietal: RC -1.7 mm, ML ± 2.5 mm; auditory: RC -2.5 mm, ML ± 4.6 mm) to induce expression of Cre-dependent stGtACR2 (AA V1-hSyn-SIO-stGtACR2-FusionRed, Upenn Vector Core). Cortical injections were performed in P42 to P56 Fezf2-2A-CreER, PlexinD1-2A-CreER and EMX-Cre reporter mice. In CreER mice, intraperitoneal tamoxifen was administered 1 week after viral injections. Cortical injections were made at 300 and 600 µm per area. In two EMX-Cre mice, bilateral injections were performed in the frontal and visual cortex (RC -4, ML ± 2.5). To target CStr neurons, injections were performed in C57BL/6J mice in two stages. First, we utilized a viral receptor complementation strategy 47 by injecting both AAV-DJ-hSYN-DIO-{hCAR} off and AAV1-SIO-hSy n1-stGtACR2-FusionRed (Supplementary Table 3) in cortex (coordinates as described above) in P21-P28 mice. Second, we performed bilateral striatal CAV-2-Cre injections, 6 weeks after cortical injections. hCAR is expressed in all transfected neurons in a Cre-OFF manner, where Cre expression stops expression of hCAR while simultaneously inducing stGtACR2 expression.</p>
        <p>For optogenetic silencing, we used the soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsin stGtACR2 (ref. 46 ). Optical fibers (NA = 0.36, ø = 0.4 mm, FT400UMT, Thorlabs) were glued into metal or ceramic ferrules (ø = 1.25 mm, Thorlabs) and secured above the cortex following viral injections. Ferrule-enclosed optical fiber implantations immediately followed cortical AAV (Supplementary Table 3) injections in Fezf2, PlexinD1 and Emx mice and striatal injections in CStr mice. One polished end of the optical fiber was positioned extradural to the site of cortical injections and interfaced with thinned skull using cyanoacrylate. Next, the fiber was fixed to the skull using light-cured glass ionomer (Vitrebond, 3M). Additional layers of dental cement and dental acrylic (Lang Dental Jet Repair Acrylic, 1223MEH) were applied around the fiber implant and the skull to reinforce for durability and long-term stability. After all layers were cured, a final outer coating of cyanoacrylate and nail polish were applied.</p>
        <p>The behavioral setup was controlled with a microcontroller-based (Arduino Due) finite state machine (Bpod r0.5, 
            <rs type="creator">Sanworks</rs>) using custom 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs>
            <rs type="software">code</rs> (
            <rs type="version">2015b</rs>, 
            <rs type="creator">MathWorks</rs>) running on a 
            <rs type="software">Linux</rs> PC. Servo motors (Turnigy TGY-306G-HV) and touch sensors were controlled by microcontrollers (
            <rs type="software">Teensy</rs>
            <rs type="version">3.2</rs>, PJRC) running custom 
            <rs type="software">code</rs>. Fifty-four mice were trained on a delayed, spatial discrimination task. Mice initiated trials by placing their forepaws on at least one of the two handles, which were mounted on servo motors that rotated out of reach during the intertrial period. Upon trial initiation, animals placed their forepaws on the handles and, after a variable duration of 0.25-0.75 s of continuous contact, the auditory stimulus was presented. Auditory stimuli consisted of a sequence of Poisson-distributed, 3-ms-long auditory click sounds 36 , presented from either a left and/or a right speaker for a variable duration between 1 and 1.5 s. The stimulus period was followed by a variable delay of up to 1 s, then the servo motors moved two lick spouts close to the animal's mouth. If the animal licked twice https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9 on the side where more clicks were presented, a drop of water reward was dispensed. The amount of water rewarded for each trial (typically 1.5 to 3 µl) was constant within a single session but was sometimes adjusted daily based on the animal's body weight. After a spout was licked twice, the contralateral spout moved out of reach to force the animal to commit to its decision.
        </p>
        <p>All trained mice were housed in groups of two or more under a reverse light cycle (12-h dark and 12-h light) and trained during their active dark cycle. Animals were trained over the course of approximately 30-60 d. After 2-3 d of restricted water access, animals began habituation to head fixation and received water from spouts in the behavior chamber. During these sessions, unilateral auditory stimuli were presented followed by a droplet of water from the ipsilateral water spout. After several habituation sessions, animals were required to touch the handles to trigger stimulus presentation. Once mice could reliably reach for the handles, the required touch duration was progressively increased to 0.75 s. During the next training stage, both spouts moved within reach of the animal following stimulus presentation. An animal was considered trained when its detection performance across two or more sessions was &gt;80%.</p>
        <p>Data were collected from multiple sensors in the behavioral setup. Touch sensors using a grounding circuit on handles and lick spouts detected contact with the animal's forepaws and tongue, respectively. A piezo sensor (1740, Adafruit) below the animal's trunk was used for monitoring body and hindlimb movements. Two webcams (C920 and B920, Logitech) were positioned to capture the animal's face (side view) and the ventral surface of the body (ventral view).</p>
        <p>Widefield imaging was done as reported previously 23,32,77 using an inverted tandem-lens macroscope and an sCMOS camera (Edge 5.5, PCO) running at 30 frames per second (fps). The focal lengths of the top lens (DC-Nikkor, Nikon) and bottom lens (85M-S, Rokinon) were 105 mm and 85 mm, respectively. The field of view was 12.5 × 10.5 mm 2 and the imaging resolution was 640 × 540 pixels after 4× spatial binning, resulting in a spatial resolution of ~20 µm per pixel. To capture GCaMP fluorescence, a 525-nm bandpass filter (86-963, Edmund optics) was placed in front of the camera. Using excitation light at two different wavelengths, we isolated Ca 2+ -dependent fluorescence and corrected for intrinsic signals (for example, hemodynamic responses) 22,25 . Excitation light was projected on the cortical surface using a 495 nm long-pass dichroic mirror (T495lpxr, Chroma) placed between the two macro lenses. The excitation light was generated by a collimated blue LED (470 nm, M470L3, Thorlabs) and a collimated violet LED (405 nm, M405L3, Thorlabs) that were coupled into the same excitation path using a dichroic mirror (87-063, Edmund optics). We alternated illumination between the two LEDs from frame to frame, resulting in one set of frames with blue and the other with violet excitation at 15 fps each. Excitation of GCaMP at 405 nm results in non-calcium-dependent fluorescence 78 , allowing us to isolate the true calcium-dependent signal by rescaling and subtracting frames with violet illumination from the preceding frames with blue illumination. Subsequent analyses were based on this differential signal. Imaging data were then rigidly aligned to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCF), using four anatomical landmarks: the left, center and right points where anterior cortex meets the olfactory bulbs, and the medial point at the base of retrosplenial cortex. Retinotopic visual mapping experiments 30,79 confirmed accurate CCF alignment and showed high correspondence between functionally identified visual areas and the CCF across PyN types (Fig. 1c).</p>
        <p>We used a two-photon resonant scanning microscope (Moveable Objective Microscope, Sutter Instruments) for continuous image acquisition at 30.9 Hz. A ×16, 0.8-NA Nikon objective lens was used for single-plane imaging with a field of view of 512 × 512 pixels (575 µm × 575 µm). Mode-locked illumination at 930 nm was delivered using a Ti:Sapphire laser (Ultra II, Coherent). The depth of focal planes was 200-600 µm below the dura. Emission was collected using bandpass red (670/50 nm) and green (525/50 nm) filters (Chroma Technologies). 
            <rs type="software">MScan</rs> software (
            <rs type="creator">Sutter Instruments</rs>) was used for image acquisition. Recordings were performed in ALM (2.5 mm rostral and 1.5 mm lateral to bregma) or MM (1.5 mm anterior and 1 mm lateral to bregma) in randomized order across mice. Across imaging session, we selected planes that differed from those of prior sessions to maximize the number of unique neurons.
        </p>
        <p>Raw images were processed using the 
            <rs type="software">Suite2P</rs> package 80 to perform motion correction, model-based region of interest (ROI) detection, correction for neuropil contamination and spike deconvolution. Somatic and non-somatic (neuropil) ROI identification was performed through a combination of a pretrained classifier and manual curation. Somata with tdTomato expression were identified in a two-step process. First, potential green channel bleed-through was subtracted from the red channel using nonrigid regression with individual channels being divided into smaller blocks. Next, all sessions were manually inspected to identify a conservative red fluorescence threshold, which was subsequently applied to all sessions. Analyses of neural activity were based on deconvolved values ('inferred spiking activity'). Because the deconvolved values do not represent absolute firing rates, we performed z-score normalization for each neuron before computing trial averages across cells. The total number of recorded neurons for each session was 396 ± 105 (mean ± s.d.).
        </p>
        <p>Photostimulation was performed using a 470-nm high-power LED (M470F3, Thorlabs) with a power density of 25 mW/mm 2 . Stimuli consisted of a square-wave stimulus that ramped down in power for 200 ms, to avoid an excitatory post-illumination rebound due to sudden release of inhibition 81 . To prevent animals' visual detection of photostimulation, through either external leakage from light-insulated mating sleeves or transmission to the retina across the brain, an external LED with matching wavelength placed at the center of the animal's visual field was flashed throughout the duration of every trial. Photoinhibition was performed in 20% of total trials and randomly interleaved between light-off trials. Once an animal was habituated and able to complete detection behavior trials with &gt;90% accuracy, bilateral optogenetic inactivation trials were introduced. During these initial sessions, optogenetic inhibition was performed from the beginning of the stimulus epoch until the end of the delay epoch. Additionally, we performed 0.5-s inhibition during four predefined epochs of the detection behavior trials: (1) first half of the stimulus, (2) second half of the stimulus, (3) delay and (4) response.</p>
        <p>After behavioral experiments, we performed transcardial perfusion with PBS followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brains were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for an additional 12-18 h at 4° C. Before sectioning, brains were rinsed three times in PBS and embedded in 4% agarose-PBS. Then, 50-µm-thick slices were made using a vibrating microtome (Leica, VT100S). Sections were then suspended in blocking solution (10% Normal Goat Serum and 0.1% Triton-X100 in 1× PBS) for 1 h followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary antibody. Next, sections were washed with PBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody at 1:500 dilution. For histological visualization of GCaMP6s, we used primary goat polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:500 dilution; Abcam, ab6673) and secondary donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500 dilution; Abcam, ab150129). Sections were then dry-mounted on slides using Vectashield (Vector Labs, H1000) before imaging. No immunostaining was https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9 performed for the visualization of FusionRed or tdTomato. Imaging was performed using an upright fluorescence macroscope (Olympus BX61). Images were acquired using 
            <rs type="software">Ocular Scientific Image Acquisition</rs> Software (
            <rs type="creator">Teledyne Imaging</rs>). Visualization and analysis were performed using 
            <rs type="software">ImageJ</rs>/
            <rs type="software">FIJI</rs> software packages.
        </p>
        <p>Cell-count quantification was performed using publicly available serial two-photon tomography datasets (http://www.brainimagelibrary. org/) 26 . Cre expression patterns for IT and PT neurons were characterized with data from eight mice, expressing either Cre-dependent GFP (PlexinD1-2A-CreER;Snap25-LSL-2A-EGFP) or tdTomato (Fezf2-2A-CreER;Ai14), respectively. Cell counting was performed via automated soma detection, using a trained convolutional neural network 82 . Datasets were then registered to the Allen CCF v3 using the 
            <rs type="software">Elastix</rs> toolbox 83 . To obtain the density of Cre-expressing neurons for individual cortical areas, we used the area outlines from the Allen CCF and computed the average sum of detected IT or PT neurons in each area, normalized by its surface area.
        </p>
        <p>We used a rigid-body image registration method implemented in the frequency domain 84 to align each imaging frame to the median over all frames in the first trial. To reduce the computational cost of subsequent analyses, we then computed the 200 highest-variance components using singular value decomposition (SVD). These components accounted for at least 95% of the total variance in each recording, whereas computing 500 components accounted for little additional variance (~0.15%). SVD reduces the raw imaging data Y to a matrix of 'spatial components' U (of size pixels by components), 'temporal components' V T (of size components by frames) and singular values S (of size components by components) to scale temporal components to the original data. The resulting decomposition has the form Y = USV T . All subsequent analysis in the time domain (such as the encoder and decoder models described below) were performed on the product SV T and the respective results were later multiplied by U, to recover results for the original pixel space. To avoid slow drift in the imaging data, SV T was high-pass filtered above 0.1 Hz using a zero-phase, second-order Butterworth filter.</p>
        <p>To compute trial averages and perform choice decoder analysis (see below), imaging data in individual trials were aligned to the four trial periods, each marked by a specific event. This was required because the duration of different trial events was randomized to reduce temporal correlations, for example, between trial initiation, the stimulus presentation and subsequent lick responses. The first period (initiate) was aligned to the time when animal initiated a trial by touching the handles, the second (stimulus) was aligned to the stimulus onset, the third (delay) to the end of the stimulus sequence, and the fourth (response) to the time when spouts were moved in to allow a lick response. After alignment, the total trial duration was 2 s and durations of respective trial episodes were 0.5 s (initiate), 1 s (stimulus), 0.2 s (delay) and 0.3 s (response).</p>
        <p>To obtain more interpretable spatial components and assess the dimensionality of cortical activity in different PyN types, we used 
            <rs type="software">sNMF</rs>. As with SVD, 
            <rs type="software">sNMF</rs> creates spatial and temporal components for each session but enforces positive spatial components. Temporal components were not enforced to be nonnegative because hemodynamic correction produces temporal dynamics that can be positive or negative, relative to baseline. We used the 
            <rs type="software">LocaNMF toolbox</rs> 33 (
            <rs type="url">https://github. com/ikinsella/locaNMF</rs>/) to transform the spatial and temporal components U and SV T into corresponding matrices A and C. A is a matrix of nonnegative spatial components (of size pixels by components). C is the corresponding temporal components (of size components by frames). In addition to regular sNMF, the 
            <rs type="software">LocaNMF toolbox</rs> can be initialized with spatial constraints based on the Allen CCF. To obtain spatially restricted localized LocaNMF components, we constructed a map of larger seed regions by merging areas in the Allen CCF together (Fig. 2e). This region map was then used to enforce that each component in A is sparse outside the boundary of a given region. To obtain dense spatial components, we used a localization threshold of 50%. For sNMF components, we used the 
            <rs type="software">LocaNMF toolbox</rs> with a single region that spanned the entire cortex to obtain cortex-wide components while ensuring that all other analysis steps were identical for sNMF and LocaNMF components. In both cases, we determined how many components in A and C were needed to explain 99% of the variance of Y (with Y = AC) after the initial SVD.
        </p>
        <p>To compare spatial sNMF and LocaNMF components from different PyN types, we embedded them in a two-dimensional space, using UMAP analysis (Fig. 2c,g). UMAP analysis was performed with the 
            <rs type="software">UMAP toolbox</rs> 35 (
            <rs type="url">https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap/)</rs>. For each recording, the first 20 spatial components in A were downsampled by a factor of 2, smoothed with a two-dimensional Gaussian filter (5 × 5 pixels, 2-pixel standard deviation) and peak normalized. Components from all recordings and animals were then combined into a larger matrix (of size pixels by components). We used UMAP to project pixels into two, maximally separating nonlinear dimensions. Each point in the two-dimensional space (Fig. 2c,g) reflects a single component from one animal in one imaging session. The same approach was used for temporal sNMF and LocaNMF components. Before the UMAP projection, we first computed the trial-averaged and z-scored activity of each component to achieve temporal dynamics that are comparable across sessions and individual mice.
        </p>
        <p>To identify PyN types based on individual spatial components (Fig. 2d,h), we performed a separate UMAP analysis for each mouse. Each of these projections excluded all components from the test animal, ensuring that the UMAP projection was not shaped by potential noise patterns or other unknown features of the test components that could affected the classifier result. We then tested the first 20 components of each session of the test animal with 100 repetitions per component. In every repetition, 1,000 components from each PyN type were randomly selected from the pre-computed UMAP space. We assigned the PyN type of the test component based on the identity of its ten nearest neighbors in UMAP space. For LocaNMF components, we performed the same procedure but additionally enforced an equal number of components from each seed region and PyN type. This prevented PyN types with a larger number of components in a region from biasing the classifier result. Classifier accuracy for each session (Fig. 2d,h) was computed as the mean probability over all repetitions to accurately identify the PyN type.</p>
        <p>To determine the size of PyN-predictive LocaNMF components, we selected all spatial components that achieved a classification accuracy of 99% or higher (all other components were assigned as nonspecific) and thresholded each component above 0.2 to obtain binary images. The size of each component was then computed as the square root of the sum of all pixels and converted to square millimeters.</p>
        <p>The linear encoding model included task-related and movement-related variables (Supplementary Table 1), as described previously 32 . Each variable consisted of multiple regressors that were combined into a larger design matrix. Binary regressors contained a single pulse that signaled the occurrence of specific events, such as the stimulus onset, and additional regression copies that were shifted forward or backward in time to account for changes in cortical activity before or after the respective event. For auditory stimuli, the time-shifted copies spanned all frames from the onset of the auditory sequence until the end of the trial. Individual click sounds were also captured by an additional regressor set that spanned the 2 s after click onset. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01245-9</p>
        <p>For licks and whisks, the time-shifted copies spanned the frames from 1 s before until 2 s after each event. For some variables, for example, previous choice, the time-shifted copies spanned the whole trial. Other variables were analog, such as measures from the piezo sensor, pupil diameter and the 200 highest temporal components of video information from both cameras (using SVD as described above). This ensured that the model could account for animal movements and accurately isolate task-related activity. Movement and task variables were additionally decorrelated due to the variable durations of the initiation, stimulus and delay period. The model was fit using ridge regression to allow for similar contributions from different correlated variables. To determine the regularization penalty λ for each column of the widefield data, we used marginal maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) 85 . MLE expresses the encoding model as a Bayesian linear model and determines the ridge penalty λ by maximizing the marginal likelihood π(D|λ) of the model, given data D. This was done iteratively by testing different λ values to determine a global minimum for the negative log-likelihood -log π(D|λ). The main advantage of this approach is that λ can be determined without computationally expensive cross-validation procedures, resulting in a ~50-fold decrease in required compute time on a regular work station. Moreover, the faster MLE approach allows adjusting λ values for individual widefield data components, resulting in higher cross-validated explained variance of the encoding model, compared to a regular cross-validation approach.</p>
        <p>Explained variance (cvR 2 ) was obtained using tenfold cross-validation. This was done by fitting the model weights to a continuous 90%-large section of the imaging data and then computing the explained variance in the remaining 10% of the data. The procedure was repeated ten times, while shifting the training and test data to ensure that each part of the recording was used in the test data in one of the folds. To assess unique explained variance by individual variables (ΔR 2 ), we created reduced models in which all regressors of a specific variable were shuffled in time. Shuffling of each regressor was done within individual trials to account for a potential impact of very slow temporal correlations due to the kinetics of the calcium indicator. The difference in explained variance between the full and the reduced models yielded the unique contribution ΔR 2 of that model variable that could not be explained by other variables in the model. The same approach was used to compute unique contributions for groups of variables, that is, 'movements' and 'task'. Here, all variables that corresponded to a given group were shuffled together.</p>
        <p>To predict animal's left/right choices from widefield data, we trained logistic regression decoders with an L1 penalty on the temporal component matrix SV T in each session. The L1 penalty was defined as the inverse of the number of observations in the test dataset during cross-validation, which yielded a good balance between the cross-validated prediction accuracy of the decoder and the number of nonzero model regressors. When decoding choice, we randomly removed trials until there were equal numbers of correct and incorrect trials where mice chose the left and the right side. By balancing left/ right choices and correct/incorrect trials, we ensured that the decoder would not reflect choices due to corresponding sensory information or side biases. The logistic regression model was implemented in 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> using the 'fitclinear' function and run repeatedly for each time point in individual trials after realigning them to trial periods as described above. In each session, all decoder runs were performed with the same number of trials (at least 250). We used tenfold cross-validation to compute decoder accuracy at each time point. β-weights were averaged from all models created during cross-validation and convolved with the spatial component matrix U to create cortical maps of the choice decoder weights.

        <p>We computed the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) to quantify choice preference of single neurons obtained from two-photon imaging. AUC values were computed by comparing the mean neural activity during the stimulus and delay period in all trials with ipsilateral versus contralateral choices. AUC values denote the specificity of the neural activity to ipsilateral or contralateral choices, with values below 0.5 signifying ipsilateral choice selectivity and AUC values above 0.5 denoting contralateral choice selectivity. To identify statistically significant choice-selective neurons, AUC values were also computed for shuffled trial labels (randomly assigning ipsilateral and contralateral choices across trials) for each neuron. This procedure was repeated 100 times to create a distribution of shuffled AUC values for each neuron. A neuron's choice selectivity was then deemed significant if the probability of obtaining the actual AUC from the shuffled AUC distribution was less than 0.05. However, surprisingly few differences were seen between cortical hemispheres. To resolve differences in inter-hemispheric activation for left-versus rightward choices we therefore employed the choice decoder analysis (Figs. 6 and7). Note that low or negative weights from the choice decoder (as seen for IT and CStr neurons in frontal cortex) do not reflect a lack of choice-related activity activity but are rather based on small differences in the activation of hemispheres that are either ipsi-or contralateral to the chosen side. (c) To isolate unique contributions from movement or task variables, we computed averaged maps of the loss in predicted variance (ΔR 2 ) by removing either group of variables from the full model. This allowed us to separately examine their respective impact on cortex-wide activity by determining, for each PyN type, where in the cortex predictive power was lost. While movement ΔR 2 patterns were comparable across PyN types (top row), PyN-type-specific differences were uncovered when removing task variables: ΔR 2 was highest in frontal cortex of EMX and PT mice, but more diffuse in IT mice with the highest ΔR 2 in auditory cortex (bottom row). above chance at all times, including the initiation period before the stimulus (gray box). This suggests that, in some trials, animals follow a pre-conceived choice that is stimulus-independent and can be decoded from cortical activity. Decoder performance was highest in the response period (dashed vertical line) when animals performed licking movements. (e) Contralateral choice weight maps during the delay period (same as in Fig. 6c). Dashed circles show the location of somatosensory whisker cortex (SS Whisker ). In all PyN types, choice weights in SS Whisker were increased in the initiation period before the stimulus (gray box). A potential explanation could be that pre-stimulus choices are reflected in choice-specific whisker movements. However, choice signals in SS Whisker persisted when removing movement-related activity from the imaging data (Supplementary Fig. 12). Whisker or other facial movements might therefore be too subtle to be captured by our analysis or choice signals in SS Whisker reflect non-overt choice-related activity.</p>

        <p>All mouse strains were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory, the Allen Brain Institute, or generated at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Transgenic strains crossed to generate double-and triple-transgenic mice used for imaging: Emx-Cre (JAX 005628), LSL-tTA (JAX 008600), Ai93D (JAX 024103), Ai162 (JAX 031562), G6s2 (JAX 024742) and H2B-eGFP (JAX 006069). EMX mice, used for calcium imaging, were bred as Ai93D;Emx-Cre;LSL-tTA. To avoid potential aberrant cortical activity patterns, EMX mice were on a doxycycline-containing diet (DOX), preventing GCaMP6 expression until they were 6 weeks or older. To obtain PT-and IT-specific transgenic lines, we used two inducible knock-in mouse lines (Fezf2-2A-CreER and PlexinD1-2A-CreER) that were generated by inserting a 2A-CreER or 2A-Flp cassette in-frame before the STOP codon of the targeted gene. Both strains have been extensively characterized to reflect endogenous gene expression patterns that are closely linked to specific excitatory neuron types and induce robust and uniform expression throughout the cortex. Only male animals were used. We have since designed a subsequent study including sex as a biological variable. Mice/rats were housed as breeding pairs or were weaned and housed by sex in individually ventilated autoclaved caging (Thoren Caging Systems, Hazelton, PA). Animals were maintained on sanitized cages and irradiated bedding with 1/4 inch corn cob bedding (The Andersons, Maumee, OH) and were fed a closed-formula, natural-ingredient, γirradiated diet (PicoLab Mouse Diet 5053, Purina LabDiet, St. Louis MO) ad libitum. A complete cage change was performed every 7-10 days within a biological safety cabinet (model Nu602-400Class II Type Nuaire, Plymouth, MN). The room was maintained on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle with a relative humidity of 30 -70%, and room temperature ranging from 69-78oF.</p>
