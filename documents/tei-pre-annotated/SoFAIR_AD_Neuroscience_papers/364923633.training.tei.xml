        <p>The development of biocompatible artificial constructs capable of microscale chemical communication and bilateral signalling at the living/non-living interface is an important challenge for synthetic biology and bio-engineering 1,2 . Synthetic cell-like micro-compartments in the form of phospholipid vesicles (liposomes) have had a major impact as non-viral vectors for targeted drug delivery 3 , tissue engineering 4 , gene therapy 5 and imaging 6 . These applications exploit liposomes as smart but essentially chemically passive synthetic micro-compartments, rather than as interactive micro-reactors capable of establishing cognate communication channels with living cells. In this regard, recent advances in the design and construction of non-lipid synthetic protocells have produced a platform of alternative technologies for preparing endogenously organized microscale objects with increased robustness, membrane programmability and lifelike agency. In particular, augmented semi-permeable membrane structures have been engineered in polymersomes 7,8 , colloidosomes 9 and proteinosomes 10,11 , giving rise to collective protocell behaviours such as motility 12,13 , phagocytosis 14 , predation 15 , DNA-based computation 16 , chemical communication [17][18][19][20] and reversible contractibility 21 . Alternatively, biochemical and biomimetic functions have been internalized within membrane-free molecularly crowded coacervate micro-droplets 22 and soft hydrogel microparticles 23 to generate coordinated behaviours such as artificial endocytosis and parasitism 24 , signalling 25 and RNA catalysis 26,27 .The development of biocompatible artificial constructs capable of microscale chemical communication and bilateral signalling at the living/non-living interface is an important challenge for synthetic biology and bio-engineering 1,2 .

        <p>Given these recent advances, it seems timely to explore the use of cell-like entities as biocompatible micro-bots geared specifically towards active interfacing with individual living cells and cell communities.Given these recent advances, it seems timely to explore the use of cell-like entities as biocompatible micro-bots geared specifically towards active interfacing with individual living cells and cell communities.</p>
        <p>Although polymersome-based nanoreactors typically 100 nm in size have been used widely as artificial organelles for the in vitro [28][29][30][31][32] and in vivo 33 uptake and activation of intracellular reactions, there are few examples of micrometer-scale architectures being developed as chemically active synthetic therapeutic cells. In principle, these programmable constructs represent archetypes of autonomic soft micro-machines capable of sensing cellular environments and providing cognate responses via chemical activation and feedback. To date, protocell signaling has been coupled to bacterial communities [34][35][36] , antigen-labelled colloidosomes (Pickering emulsions) used to enhance the uptake, recruitment and activation of antigen-presenting mouse cells 37 , hydrogel-containing proteinosomes exploited for the intracellular killing of cancer cells 38 , and multi-compartmentalized lipid vesicles comprising a glucose-metabolism system and membrane-fusion machinery used as synthetic beta cells for fusion-mediated dynamic insulin secretion 39 .Although polymersome-based nanoreactors typically 100 nm in size have been used widely as artificial organelles for the in vitro [28][29][30][31][32] and in vivo 33 uptake and activation of intracellular reactions, there are few examples of micrometer-scale architectures being developed as chemically active synthetic therapeutic cells.

        <p>In this paper we use cell-sized coacervate micro-droplets derived from electrostatically mediated liquid-liquid phase separation as the basis for a new approach to the potential development of synthetic therapeutic protocells capable of generating a nitric oxide signal for in vitro and in vivo blood vessel vasodilation. Coacervate droplets exhibit high levels of biomolecule sequestration, promote enzyme activities and support cell-free gene expression 22,[40][41][42] , are stabilized by ultra-thin coatings of fatty acids 43 , block copolymers 44 or silica nanoparticles 45 , and can be encapsulated within liposomes 46,47 and proteinosomes 48 . Although many reports have addressed the construction and biomimetic behaviours of coacervate protocells, there are relatively few investigations concerning the use of coacervates for developing biomedical applications [49][50][51][52] . Here we develop a first step towards a membrane-enclosed therapeutic protocell based on the spontaneous self-assembly of hemoglobin (Hb)-containing erythrocyte membrane fragments on the surface of preformed polysaccharide/polynucleotide coacervate micro-droplets containing glucose oxidase (GOx) (Fig. 1a). Encapsulation within a thin envelope of erythrocyte membrane fragments provides a physical barrier that minimises contact between the coacervate vesicles and natural erythrocytes, which in turn significantly improves hemocompatibility [53][54][55] and extends the blood circulation time. We utilise the sequestered enzymes to program a spatially coupled reaction cascade that in the presence of glucose and hydroxyurea generates a protocell-induced flux of nitric oxide (NO) in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1b).In this paper we use cell-sized coacervate micro-droplets derived from electrostatically mediated liquid-liquid phase separation as the basis for a new approach to the potential development of synthetic therapeutic protocells capable of generating a nitric oxide signal for in vitro and in vivo blood vessel vasodilation.

        <p>Based on the endogenous NO production, we demonstrate the onset of protocell-mediated blood vessel vasodilation in a model system of pre-contracted thoracic artery rings. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we exploit the high hemocompatibility and improved blood circulation of the NO-producing coacervate vesicles to demonstrate the possibility of in vivo vasodilation within a perfused rabbit carotid artery.Based on the endogenous NO production, we demonstrate the onset of protocell-mediated blood vessel vasodilation in a model system of pre-contracted thoracic artery rings.

        <p>Construction of erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles. Aqueous suspensions of membrane-enclosed polysaccharide-polynucleotide protocells were produced at pH 7 by the spontaneous interfacial assembly of negatively charged erythrocyte membrane fragments on the surface of preformed positively charged coacervate micro-droplets prepared by mixing diethylaminoethyl-dextran chloride (DEAE-dextran, Mw = 500 kDa, 10 mg•mL -1 ) and doublestranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA, low molecular weight fraction, salmon sperm, 10 mg•mL - 1 ) at a DEAE-dextran : DNA weight ratio of 2 : 1. Prior to addition of the membrane fragments, optical and fluorescence microscopy images showed a polydisperse population of membranefree spherical coacervate droplets with diameters up to 20 μm (Figs 2a,b). Glucose oxidase (GOx, 0.02 mg mL -1 ; often labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), partition constant, 85; encapsulation efficiency, 85%; Supplementary Fig. 1a) was sequestered homogeneously into the molecularly crowded coacervate interior during micro-droplet formation (Supplementary Fig. 2).Construction of erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles.

        <p>To prepare biomembrane-bounded coacervate droplets, an aqueous suspension of submicrometre-sized erythrocyte membrane fragments was prepared by hypotonic hemolysis (Supplementary Fig. 3) and added to a dispersion of the DEAE-dextran/dsDNA coacervate droplets (10 mg mL -1 ; fragments : droplets = 1 : 20, w/w). This resulted in a size increase from 5.4 ± 1.9 to 6.3 ± 1.6 µm (Supplementary Fig. 4) and reversal of the zeta potential from +15.1 ± 1.7 to -10.5 ± 2.9 mV; the latter being close to the surface potential determined for the extracted membrane fragments alone (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5). Formation of a continuous erythrocyte membrane-derived shell on the surface of the coacervate droplets was confirmed by optical and fluorescence microscopy images after treating the hybrid protocells with a lipid stain (Figs 2d,e). Corresponding images and fluorescence line profiles of single protocells stained for DNA and lipid confirmed the presence of a homogeneous coacervate interior enclosed within an intact shell of erythrocyte membrane fragments (Figs 2f,g). Electrostatically induced accumulation of the lipid fragments gave rise to an irregular surface texture with variations in the membrane thickness ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 μm in the 3D reconstructed fluorescence microscopy images of individual droplets (Fig. 2h).To prepare biomembrane-bounded coacervate droplets, an aqueous suspension of submicrometre-sized erythrocyte membrane fragments was prepared by hypotonic hemolysis (Supplementary Fig. 3) and added to a dispersion of the DEAE-dextran/dsDNA coacervate droplets (10 mg mL -1 ; fragments : droplets = 1 : 20, w/w).

        <p>FTIR spectra showed characteristic protein and phospholipid absorbance bands for samples of the membrane fragments and membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles but not for the membrane-free coacervates (Supplementary Fig. 6). Typically, the lipid and protein mass fractions were 42.5 and 45.8% by dry weight (Supplementary Figs. 7 and8). Gel electrophoresis of the extracted membrane fragments indicated that haemoglobin (Hb; subunit band at 14.4 kDa) was present in the lysate (Supplementary Fig. 9), typically at concentrations of approximately 0.1 mg mL -1 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Significantly, considerable levels of Hb were also observed in samples of the coated coacervate droplets (Supplementary Fig. 9), indicating that formation of the membrane-derived shell occurred simultaneously with the transfer of erythrocyte proteins.FTIR spectra showed characteristic protein and phospholipid absorbance bands for samples of the membrane fragments and membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles but not for the membrane-free coacervates (Supplementary Fig. 6).

        <p>Incubation of DEAE-dextran/dsDNA coacervate micro-droplets in an isotonic suspension of erythrocytes indicated that the membrane-free protocells exhibited considerably higher in vitro hemolytic activity compared with the erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles (Fig. 3a). Levels of hemolysis increased rapidly as the concentration of uncoated droplets was increased such that values of over 90% were attained after 90 min at coacervate concentrations above 2.25 mg•mL -1 (Fig. 3b).Incubation of DEAE-dextran/dsDNA coacervate micro-droplets in an isotonic suspension of erythrocytes indicated that the membrane-free protocells exhibited considerably higher in vitro hemolytic activity compared with the erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles (Fig. 3a).

        <p>In contrast, less than 20% hemolytic activity was observed for erythrocytes incubated with coated droplets under the same isotonic conditions (Figs 3b,c). For example, only 2.6% hemolysis was observed after 90 min at an enclosed protocell concentration of 0.6 mg mL -1 . We attributed the increase in hemocompatibility to the blocking of deleterious contact interactions between the negatively charged red blood cells (Fig. S5) and positively charged coacervate matrix (Fig. 2c) in the presence of the negatively charged shell of erythrocyte fragments (Fig. 2c). This was consistent with fluorescence confocal microscopy images, which showed minimal levels of surface contact between the coacervate vesicles and erythrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 11).In contrast, less than 20% hemolytic activity was observed for erythrocytes incubated with coated droplets under the same isotonic conditions (Figs 3b,c).

        <p>Given the above observations, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to monitor changes in the population dynamics in binary communities of erythrocytes and coacervate-based protocells prepared in isotonic solutions at an initial droplet : erythrocyte number ratio of 1 : 4. 2D dot plots of forward light scattered-height (FSC-H) versus side light scattered-height (SSC-H) indicated that single populations of native coacervate droplets, erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate droplets and erythrocytes showed distinct scattering profiles (Figs 3d,e andi,j). As a consequence, we tracked the changes in the numbers of protocells and living cells present in freshly mixed binary populations over a period of 90 min (Figs 3f-h andk-m). While a progressive depletion of the red blood cell population was observed in mixtures of native coacervate droplets and erythrocytes, minimal changes in the population number densities were determined for binary communities of the red blood cells and biomembrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles. In the former case, a new sub-population of erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate droplets with relatively low FSC-H and high SSC-H values was observed (Fig. 3h), suggesting that hemolysis resulted in the coacervate droplets becoming coated in situ in released membrane fragments. Time-dependent FACS analysis indicated that addition of the membrane-free coacervate droplets resulted in a rapid decrease in the number of red blood cells to ca. 55% over an initial period of 5 min, after which the rate of hemolysis decreased until only 6 % of the erythrocyte population remained after 90 min (Figs 3n,o). In comparison, the percentages of erythrocytes present after 5 and 90 min were 98 and 92 %, respectively, in mixtures containing the biomembrane fragment-enclosed droplets (Figs 3p,q). No significant changes in the FACS scattering plots were observed in control experiments involving single populations of erythrocytes, coacervate droplets, or membrane-enclosed coacervate droplets (Supplementary Fig. 12). The latter were also stable in serum for at least 90 min; in contrast, the membrane-free coacervate droplets coalesced into a bulk phase within 60 min (Supplementary Fig. 13).Given the above observations, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to monitor changes in the population dynamics in binary communities of erythrocytes and coacervate-based protocells prepared in isotonic solutions at an initial droplet : erythrocyte number ratio of 1 : 4. 2D dot plots of forward light scattered-height (FSC-H) versus side light scattered-height (SSC-H) indicated that single populations of native coacervate droplets, erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate droplets and erythrocytes showed distinct scattering profiles (Figs 3d,e andi,j).

        <p>Given that membrane encapsulation of the DEAEdextran/dsDNA coacervate droplets considerably improved their hemocompatibility, we reasoned that this would also extend their blood circulation times. In vivo experiments were conducted using erythrocyte-membrane enclosed coacervate vesicles containing sequestered sulfo-cyanine 5 carboxylic acid (Cy5) as a fluorescent marker. A suspension of the Cy5-loaded protocells was intravenously injected into a group of six rabbits and samples of blood collected at various time points. The blood clearance profiles indicated that approximately 25% of the injected population of coacervate vesicles was retained in the blood after 2 h (Fig. 4a). In contrast, the uncoated coacervate droplets were rapidly cleared from the blood stream with a retention of only 8 % after 2 h (Fig. 4a). Based on the pharmacokinetic profiles, the elimination half-lifes were 31.0 and 16.1 min for the membrane-enclosed and uncoated coacervate droplets, respectively.Given that membrane encapsulation of the DEAEdextran/dsDNA coacervate droplets considerably improved their hemocompatibility, we reasoned that this would also extend their blood circulation times.

        <p>Fluorescence imaging was used to investigate the biodistribution of the Cy5-loaded coacervate vesicles in a range of major tissues analysed 2 and 24 h after injection (Fig. 4b). High fluorescence intensities were observed after 2 h specifically in the liver, spleen and kidney, as well as in blood. In each tissue, the fluorescence markedly decreased after 24 h. Quantitative analysis confirmed that the accumulated protocell content per gram of tissue after 2 and 24 h was highest in the liver and spleen, followed by lower but significant levels in the kidney, lung and blood at 2 but not 24 h (Fig. 4c). When normalized to the total fluorescence, the relative signal intensities after 2 h were dominant for the liver and blood (Fig. 4d). In contrast, only the liver showed a normalized fluorescence output after 24 h (Fig. 4d), indicative of accumulation and degradation of the coacervate vesicles via metabolic pathways of the liver.Fluorescence imaging was used to investigate the biodistribution of the Cy5-loaded coacervate vesicles in a range of major tissues analysed 2 and 24 h after injection (Fig. 4b).

        <p>As the Hb present in the erythrocyte membrane extract exhibited high peroxidase-like activity (Fig. 5a), we sought to exploit the bio-enclosed coacervate vesicles as a new type of synthetic protocell capable of generating nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of hydroxyurea and H2O2 56 . To achieve this, we spatially coupled Hb-mediated production of NO at the erythrocyte shell surface with the endogenous generation of a localized H2O2 signal by sequestering GOx within the DEAE-dextran/dsDNA matrix and using glucose (5 mM) as the input to initiate the cascade reaction in the presence of hydroxyurea (2 mM) (Fig. 5b).As the Hb present in the erythrocyte membrane extract exhibited high peroxidase-like activity (Fig. 5a), we sought to exploit the bio-enclosed coacervate vesicles as a new type of synthetic protocell capable of generating nitric oxide (NO) in the presence of hydroxyurea and H2O2 56 .

        <p>Under these conditions, the coacervate vesicles produced NO typically with initial rates of ca. 0.25 μM•min -1 and yields of up to 8.7 μM over a reaction period of 180 min. The production of NO was dependent on the glucose and hydroxyurea concentrations for a constant protocell number density (Supplementary Fig. 14). In contrast, negligible NO was produced in the absence of GOx or without the erythrocyte membrane fragments (Fig. 5b), or when the coacervate microdroplets were coated in the zwitterionic phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Supplementary Fig. 15). The spatial localization of H2O2 (GOx activity) and NO (Hb activity) production within the protocells was confirmed from fluorescence microscopy images of single biomembrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles prepared in the presence of Amplex Red and DAF-2Under these conditions, the coacervate vesicles produced NO typically with initial rates of ca. 0.25 μM•min -1 and yields of up to 8.7 μM over a reaction period of 180 min.

On addition of glucose, peroxidation of Amplex Red gave rise to a rapid increase in red fluorescence specifically within the coacervate interior due to formation and retention of resorufin (Figs 5c,d). At the same time, reaction of DAF-2 with nitrite produced by NO oxidation in water resulted in a progressive increase in green fluorescence initially within the protocell (Figs 5e,f). As the Hb was located predominantly at the membrane surface, we attributed the increase in green fluorescence within the coacervate phase to the selective partitioning of DAF-2 (K=140, Supplementary Fig. 1b) and diffusion of NO into the protocell interior. With time, green fluorescence was also observed outside the protocells (Fig. 5e), indicating that NO and nitrite were slowly released into the external environment as the cascade reaction proceeded.(2-(3,6-dihydroxy-4,5-diamino-9H-xanthen-9-yl)-benzoic acid).

        <p>In vitro NO generation and blood vessel vasodilation. Given the NO-generating capacity of the erythrocyte membrane-enclosed GOx-containing coacervate vesicles, we investigated their potential as synthetic protocells capable of triggering the NO-mediated biochemical pathway for blood vessel vasodilation in vitro. The hybrid protocells were incubated in the presence of glucose with a 5 mm-wide section of a pre-contracted thoracic aorta connected to a force transducer (Supplementary Figs. 16,17) 57,58 . Protocell-mediated production of NO was initiated immediately by addition of hydroxyurea, which gave rise to a concomitant decrease in the recorded isometric tension force associated with the aortic ring (Fig. 6a). In contrast, minimal changes were observed when GOx-free hybrid protocells were used in the experiments (Fig. 6b). Typically, the enzymatically active protocells produced NO levels of up to 1.3 μM, which gave rise to a tension force decrease of 5.0 g and a blood vessel relaxation of 38% (Fig. 6c). Moreover, sequential addition of aliquots of hydroxyurea produced a stepwise decrease in the tension force (Supplementary Fig. 18), confirming that the protocell-mediated generation of NO within the aortic rings was sufficient to induce vasodilation in the pre-contracted tissue.In vitro NO generation and blood vessel vasodilation.

        <p>In vivo NO generation in blood vessel tissue. Based on the above results and given the hemocompatibility and improved blood circulation profile of the erythrocyte membraneenclosed coacervate vesicles, we investigated whether the GOx-containing protocells could be used for the in vivo generation of NO in blood vessel tissue. To address this challenge, a safe dose of GOx-loaded coacervate vesicles together with hydroxyurea was intravenously injected into a rabbit carotid artery (Supplementary Fig. 19). We reasoned that the endogenous concentration of blood glucose would be sufficient to trigger the protocell-induced spatially coupled GOx/Hb cascade reaction, thereby increasing the levels of NO in the blood stream and surrounding blood vessels. Time-dependent monitoring over a period of 20 min after injection showed a progressive increase in the concentration of blood NO, reaching a value of 210 ± 60 nM after 10 minutes (Fig. 6d). The raised NO levels were considerably lower than the threshold value for NO-mediated cell toxicity 59 . The in vivo generation of NO was also confirmed by fluorescence imaging of the extracted blood vessels after staining with the NO intracellular probe, diaminofluorescein-FM diacetate (DAF-FM DA, green fluorescence). High levels of green fluorescence were observed in sections of the blood vessel tissue after injection of the GOxcontaining erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles (Fig. 6e-g). In comparison, minimal levels of green fluorescence were observed in blood vessel sections when GOx-free coacervate vesicles or hydroxyurea alone were injected into the animals (Supplementary Fig. 20), confirming that the protocell-confined GOx/Hb enzyme cascade was sufficiently active in vivo to increase the NO concentration within the blood vessels.In vivo NO generation in blood vessel tissue.

        <p>In vivo blood vessel vasodilation. Given that we were able to detect levels of NO in blood vessel tissue (210 ± 60 nM) well above those generally considered to stimulate vasodilation (10 nM) 60 and the ability of the GOx-containing erythrocyte membrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles to induce in vitro vasodilation in pre-contracted thoracic aorta, we explored as a proof-of-principle whether the protocells were capable of triggering the NO-mediated biochemical pathway for blood vessel vasodilation in vivo. We collected samples of rabbit carotid arteries 20 mins after intravenous injection of a mixture of the NO-producing protocells and hydroxyurea, and determined the blood vessel circumference from sectioned tissue. The stained sections revealed a statistically significant (p＜0.05) increase in the vessel circumference from 8.2 ± 1.1 mm in the control group (GOx-free protocells) to 9.7 ± 1.1 mm for injections of the GOx-containing protocells (Supplementary Fig. 21). This corresponded to an expanded vessel diameter of 3.1 mm, which was ca. 1.2 times larger than in the unrelaxed artery. In addition, the mean heart rate of the rabbit decreased from 222.0 ± 23.0 to 205.5 ± 19.0 min -1 , and the systolic blood pressure decreased from 144.0 ± 15.5 to 98.5 ± 18.0 mm Hg after administration of the GOx-containing protocells (Supplementary Fig. 22).In vivo blood vessel vasodilation.

        <p>In this paper, we demonstrate a novel protocell model based on the facile assimilation of erythrocyte membrane fragments and coacervate micro-droplets to produce membranebounded molecularly crowded cell-like objects that exhibit high hemocompatibility and improved blood circulation times. The presence of Hb and GOx within the membrane fragments and coacervate matrix, respectively, is exploited for the generation of a NO flux via a spatially coupled enzyme cascade in association with the transmission of an endogenous H2O2 signal. As a consequence, the protocells can be used to generate NO both in vitro within extracted aortic rings and in vivo via circulation within blood vessels. The concomitant vasoactivity leads to dilation of the pre-contracted aortic rings and provisional in vivo evidence for blood vessel vasodilation as a specific outcome of protocell functionality. We note that the direct release of NO doses to biological targets has some clinical limitations due to both the relative short lifetime and high reactivity 61 ; in this regard, surface modification of the hybrid protocells with specific cellular targets or immobilization of the coacervate vesicles in implanted medical devices might facilitate the safe transport of the cell-like vasoactive agents and their delivery to specific disease sites for required diagnostic applications.In this paper, we demonstrate a novel protocell model based on the facile assimilation of erythrocyte membrane fragments and coacervate micro-droplets to produce membranebounded molecularly crowded cell-like objects that exhibit high hemocompatibility and improved blood circulation times.

        <p>Although our work is at an early stage and demonstrates a proof-of-concept, it should be relatively straightforward to advance the underpinning methodology to produce more complex biomembrane-enclosed coacervate vesicles that encompass increased levels of recognition and communication with living cells, including the exchange of genetic information. 15,42 In the longer term, our approach offers a novel pathway to the development of endogenously organized biocompatible cell-like objects and provides a step towards the fabrication of soft micro-bots for future applications in biomedicine, cellular diagnostics and bioengineering. The capability to encapsulate a variety of therapeutic payloads also provides new prospects for the development of coacervate-based protocells as novel theragnostic biocarriers for the simultaneous treatment and monitoring of diseases with enhanced therapeutic efficiency. In this respect, it seems probable that the polyelectrolyte (DEAE-dextran) and sheep erythrocyte membrane fragments associated with the protocells will be immunogenic as currently configured.

The blood vessels were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 4 μm, and processed for routine histology with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Morphometric analysis was carried out using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ts2R) with a 4× objective.In vivo blood vessel vasodilation. New Zealand white rabbits (n=6 independent rabbits per group, 2.5-3.0 kg) were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (1.2 mL•kg -1 ) and injected with a suspension of erythrocyte membrane-coated GOx-loaded DEAE-dextran/dsDNA coacervate protocells containing hydroxyurea (2 mL kg -1 ; containing 3.5 mg mL -1 protocells, 200 nM GOx, 20 mM hydroxyurea).
