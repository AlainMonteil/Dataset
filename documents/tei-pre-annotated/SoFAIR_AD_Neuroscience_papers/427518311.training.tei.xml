        <p>According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 10 patients being anosmic (6.9%) and 7 being severely microsmic (4.8%). At the time CA-UPSIT was administered, a weak correlation was observed between the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste and olfactory test scores (Spearman's r=-0.26). Among 112 patients who self-reported normal sense of smell at last follow-up, CA-UPSIT revealed normal smell in 46 (41.1%), mild microsmia in 46 (41.1%), moderate microsmia in 11 (9.8%), severe microsmia in 3 (2.3%), and anosmia in 6 (5.4%) patients; however, of those patients self-reporting normal smell but who were found to have hypofunction on testing, 62 out of 66 had self-reported reduction in sense of smell or taste at an earlier time point.According to CA-UPSIT, 87 subjects (60.0%) exhibited some smell dysfunction, with 10 patients being anosmic (6.9%) and 7 being severely microsmic (4.8%).

        <p>Despite most patients report a subjectively normal sense of smell, we observed a high percentage of persistent smell dysfunction at 6 months from the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 11.7% of patients being anosmic or severely microsmic. These data highlight a significant long-term rate of smell alteration in patients with previous SARS-COV-2 infection.Despite most patients report a subjectively normal sense of smell, we observed a high percentage of persistent smell dysfunction at 6 months from the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 11.7% of patients being anosmic or severely microsmic.

        <p>In patients with mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 , sudden changes in the sense of smell or taste are reported by around two-thirds of subjects (Spinato et al., 2020) as being an early marker of COVID-19 and representing the most common long-lasting symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (Boscolo-Rizzo et al., 2020c).In patients with mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 , sudden changes in the sense of smell or taste are reported by around two-thirds of subjects (Spinato et al., 2020) as being an early marker of COVID-19 and representing the most common long-lasting symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (Boscolo-Rizzo et al., 2020c).</p>

        <p>To date, while several authors have investigated the recovery of the olfactory function in patients with psychophysical tests (Lechien et al., 2020;Vaira et al., 2020b, Otte et al. 2020, Iannuzzi et al. 2020). However, few of these studies to date have exceeded the 2-month follow-up (Niklasen et al. 2020) and therefore further improvement may occur. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies, based on data obtained from the patient's interview, have so far investigated the recovery of olfactory dysfunction 6 months after onset (Hopkins et al., 2020;Klein et al., 2020).To date, while several authors have investigated the recovery of the olfactory function in patients with psychophysical tests (Lechien et al., 2020;Vaira et al., 2020b, Otte et al. 2020, Iannuzzi et al. 2020).

        <p>We conducted a prospective study on adult patients consecutively assessed at Treviso Regional Hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs performed according to World Health Organization recommendation (World Health Organization 2020). All patients were initially home-isolated with mild-to-moderate symptoms. Patients were considered mildly symptomatic if they had less severe clinical symptoms with no evidence of pneumonia, not requiring hospitalization, and therefore considered suitable for being treated at home. Patients with a history of previous craniofacial trauma, surgery or radiotherapy in the oral and sinonasal area, and those reporting a pre-existing olfactory dysfunction were excluded from the study.We conducted a prospective study on adult patients consecutively assessed at Treviso Regional Hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal and throat swabs performed according to World Health Organization recommendation (World Health Organization 2020).

        <p>After collecting clinical data through a survey administered by telephone interview at the time of diagnosis, the same patients were re-contacted after 4 and 8 weeks. During the subsequent interviews the same questions were re-administered. In details, symptoms were assessed through ad hoc questions and structured questionnaires, including the ARTIQ (Acute Respiratory Tract Infection Questionnaire) and the SNOT-22, item "Sense of smell or taste", as previously reported (Spinato et al., 2020). Briefly, the SNOT-22 grades symptom severity as none (0), very mild (1), mild or slight (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or as bad as it can be (5).After collecting clinical data through a survey administered by telephone interview at the time of diagnosis, the same patients were re-contacted after 4 and 8 weeks.

        <p>Finally, at 6-months from diagnosis, the Italian version of the UPSIT (Sensonics, Haddon Heights, NJ, USA) was used to assess the ability to identify odorants (Doty et al., 1984b) along with the administration of the above described questionnaires. The UPSIT is a well validated and reliable scratch-and-sniff test (test-retest r=0.94) based on the forced-choice among four alternative odorants. According to manufacturer instructions, each patient was asked to scratch each of the 40 microencapsulated odorants present in the booklets with the tip of a pencil, provided in the kit, and to select the name of the odorant closest to the one perceived. Each patient was assisted by an examiner to verify that the test was correctly performed. The number of correct answers was calculated according to the test manual. As the names of 6 odorants reported in the UPSIT test have previously been shown not to match the common perception of those odorants by the Italian population leading to misidentification &gt; 20% in a population of normal subjects, a reduced and culturally adapted version of the Italian UPSIT (CA-UPSIT) including 34 odorants that had been identified correctly by more than 80% of normal subjects, was used to evaluate the sense of smell in our subjects according to Cenedese et al. (Cenedese et al., 2015) and Parola et al. (Parola and Liberini, 1999). The following scores on a scale of 0-34 have been used: probable malingering, 00-04; total anosmia, 05-15; severe microsmia, 16-19; moderate microsmia, 20-23; mild microsmia, 24-27; normosmia, 28-34.

        <p>Although we have encouraged the self-reported evaluation of anosmia as it is widely available and has as a baseline parameter of comparison (that is, the subjective perception of smell preceding the onset of COVID-19 (Boscolo-Rizzo et al., 2020b), these observations suggest that subjective evaluation of the olfactory function is inadequate to fully evaluate olfactory recovery. Consistently, several authors have underlined that subjectivity of self-reporting may lead to underestimation of the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction (Mazzatenta et al., 2020;Moein et al., 2020;Vaira et al., 2020b;Yan et al., 2020).Although we have encouraged the self-reported evaluation of anosmia as it is widely available and has as a baseline parameter of comparison (that is, the subjective perception of smell preceding the onset of COVID-19 (Boscolo-Rizzo et al., 2020b), these observations suggest that subjective evaluation of the olfactory function is inadequate to fully evaluate olfactory recovery.

The prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the general population is estimated to be between 15-21%, with a 5% prevalence of functional anosmia (Hummel et al, 2017, Landis et al 2006), However, the rate of psychophysical long-term olfactory dysfunction observed in the present series is significantly higher than expected from such poulation studies. Interestingly, 93.9% of patients showing some degree of olfactory dysfunction at psychophysical evaluation but self-reporting a normal sense of smell or taste at 6-month, had previously complained of a subjective chemosensory alteration during the course of their SARS-CoV-2 infection.In contrast there is a risk that use psychophysical tests in the absence of a baseline assessment prior to exposure o SARS-CoV-2 infection could overestimate the prevalence of COVID-19-related smell disorders as it might detect pre-existing smell alterations .

        <p>As observed in another study (Otte et al., 2020), this suggests that patients, who previously had a significant chemosensory alteration and had only a partial recovery, tend to overestimate the extent of their recovery thus reporting a normal although psychophysically still impaired olfactory function.As observed in another study (Otte et al., 2020), this suggests that patients, who previously had a significant chemosensory alteration and had only a partial recovery, tend to overestimate the extent of their recovery thus reporting a normal although psychophysically still impaired olfactory function.</p>
        <p>This mismatch between self-reported loss of the smell and the results of psychophysical testing has A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t been previously reported (Haxel et al., 2012), along with the potential for co-existing nasal obstruction to confound self-report (Landis et al., 2003), and highlights the importance of including both measures in future studies. Self-reported measures more likely reflect perceived functional disability and impact on quality of life and still have value in the assessment of olfactory loss (Zou et al., 2021) Remarkably, according to CA-UPSIT scores, 11.7% of subjects showed a psychophysical significant alteration in the sense of smell consisting in anosmia or severe hyposmia. Thus, considering the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the worldwide population, a parallel high incidence of long-term morbidity with significant impact on the quality of life of patients is expected in the near future as well as a significant burden of disease on the health system. This should increase efforts to search for therapeutic strategies that should be guided basis on the pathogenesis of the disease.This mismatch between self-reported loss of the smell and the results of psychophysical testing has A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t been previously reported (Haxel et al., 2012), along with the potential for co-existing nasal obstruction to confound self-report (Landis et al., 2003), and highlights the importance of including both measures in future studies.

        <p>Several possible mechanisms for loss of smell in the course of COVID-19 have been explored but it is still unclear how SARS-CoV-2 mediates smell loss. Briefly, the pathogenesis of the olfactory dysfunctions can be explained by two theories of direct viral cytopathy and systemic inflammatory cascade of events. According to recent studies, SARS-CoV-2 may affect directly the olfactory epithelium through perturbation of supporting cells which maintain the integrity of the olfactory sensory neurons and express ACE2 protein and cell surface protease TMPRSS2 which are both necessary for the virus entry into the target cells (Brann et al., 2020;Fodoulian et al., 2020).Several possible mechanisms for loss of smell in the course of COVID-19 have been explored but it is still unclear how SARS-CoV-2 mediates smell loss.

        <p>However, systematic studies on the histopathology of the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19 are lacking (Deshmukh et al., 2020). A preliminary report suggests a possible role of the inflammation in the pathogenesis of the olfactory loss thus providing rationale for use of corticosteroids (Vaira et al., 2020c). Furthermore, olfactory training is the only disease-specific Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/chemse/advance-article/doi/10.1093/chemse/bjab006/6133714 by guest on 13 February 2021 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t intervention with demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of post-infectious olfactory dysfunction and it is assumed that it acts through by increasing both the regenerative ability and the neuroplastic potential of olfactory neurons. Therefore, given the above observations, the absence of randomized controlled trials investigating specific treatment in COVID-19-related anosmia, and the relatively high safety profile associated with their use, topical corticosteroid and olfactory training may be considered in selected patient with post-COVID-19 smell disturbance (Levy, 2020). Based on the evolution of the self-reported alteration of sense of smell or taste in the present series, symptoms tend to stabilize after two months from the onset. This could suggest that any therapy should be started early after the nasopharyngeal swab results negative as the possible adverse effects of a corticosteroid treatment in patients with ongoing upper airway SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be investigated.However, systematic studies on the histopathology of the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19 are lacking (Deshmukh et al., 2020).

        <p>There are a number of limitations to this study. First, a baseline or early psychophysical evaluation of the sense of smell was not done in the present series. However, as previously discussed although there is a possibility that psychophysical tests at six months may be detecting a pre-existing olfactory dysfunction not perceived by the patient, the rate of psychophysical long-term smell alteration observed in the present series is significantly higher than would be expected based on estimates of the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in the general population. Endoscopy was not performed in this study cohort to exclude patients with conditions known to have a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which has an estimated prevalence of 10.9% of adults based on patient reported symptoms (Hastan et al., 2011) or 3 -6.4% based on radiological imaging (Dietz de Loos, 2019). Olfactory dysfunction is reported by 90% of patients with CRS with nasal polyps and 76% of patients with CRS without nasal polyps (Abdalla et al., 2012), but such cases will be captured by the population studies estimating the prevalence of olfactory loss in adults discussed above, and again cannot fully account for the high prevalence of persisting olfactory A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t hypofunction detected in our patient cohort. Furthermore, only 3.3% of patients reported blocked nose at the time of psychophysical assessment. Thirdly, a culturally adapted version of the Italian UPSIT was used to psychophysically evaluate the sense of smell. The validation study for this Italian version was performed only in a small group of patients (Cenedese et al., 2015, Parola andLiberini, 1999) and further work is required to determine the true validity of the adapted version. Despite this is the most reliable and accurate olfactory test available (Doty et al., 1984), it is only an identification test not testing discrimination ability and olfactory threshold. Thus, the UPSIT identification test may not capture the full extent of olfactory disturbances. Although it is reported that threshold, discrimination and identification tests measure a common source of variance in healthy subjectsthat is that outcomes of the different types of test should be correlated with one another (Doty, 1994), this deserves further evaluation in different disease processes. It has been observed that patients with post-infectious hyposmia performed relatively well in both threshold and discrimination but poorly in identification tests (Liu et al., 2020). Identification testing alone may therefore over-estimate the severity of loss and may in part explain the weak correlation between self-reported smell loss and the UPSIT scores reported herein. Future studies will likely benefit from using psychophysical tests that encompass both threshold, discrimination and identification testing, such as the "Sniffin' Sticks" test. A psychophysical evaluation of the sense of taste was not performed in the present study. Although the commonly reported loss of taste might largely depend on impairment of retronasal olfaction, recent subjective studies have shown that COVID-19 associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell but also affects taste and chemesthesis (Gerkin et al., 2020;Parma et al., 2020). The psychophysical evaluation of the sense of taste as well as histopathological evaluation of taste buds and oral mucosa are highly desirable to clarify this aspect. Finally, these results apply to a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with mild-to-moderate disease. A long term psychophysical evaluation of the olfaction should be performed also in patients previously hospitalized for severe COVID-19 which seem to self-report a lower prevalence of smell or taste alteration at the onset of the disease (Borsetto et al., 2020).

        <p>In conclusion, the results of the present study show a very high prevalence of psychophysical olfactory dysfunction six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. As recovery from post-viral loss may continue beyond this period (Reden et al 2006), further evaluation is required to determine whether such dysfunction is long-lasting. The large discrepancy between psychophysical and self-reported altered sense of smell highlights the importance to use psychophysical tests in the long-term followup of these patients to capture the burden of permanent olfactory dysfunction. Finally, there is a clear need for more research on treatment strategies for this group of patients.In conclusion, the results of the present study show a very high prevalence of psychophysical olfactory dysfunction six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
