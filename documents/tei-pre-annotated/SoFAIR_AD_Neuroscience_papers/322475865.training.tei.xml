        <p>Background: Although autistic adults often discuss experiencing ''autistic burnout'' and attribute serious negative outcomes to it, the concept is almost completely absent from the academic and clinical literature. Methods: We used a community-based participatory research approach to conduct a thematic analysis of 19 interviews and 19 public Internet sources to understand and characterize autistic burnout. Interview participants were autistic adults who identified as having been professionally diagnosed with an autism spectrum condition. We conducted a thematic analysis, using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach, at semantic and latent levels, through a critical paradigm. We addressed trustworthiness through multiple coders, peer debriefing, and examination of contradictions. Results: Autistic adults described the primary characteristics of autistic burnout as chronic exhaustion, loss of skills, and reduced tolerance to stimulus. They described burnout as happening because of life stressors that added to the cumulative load they experienced, and barriers to support that created an inability to obtain relief from the load. These pressures caused expectations to outweigh abilities resulting in autistic burnout. Autistic adults described negative impacts on their health, capacity for independent living, and quality of life, including suicidal behavior. They also discussed a lack of empathy from neurotypical people and described acceptance and social support, time off/reduced expectations, and doing things in an autistic way/unmasking as associated in their experiences with recovery from autistic burnout. Conclusions: Autistic burnout appears to be a phenomenon distinct from occupational burnout or clinical depression. Better understanding autistic burnout could lead to ways to recognize, relieve, or prevent it, including highlighting the potential dangers of teaching autistic people to mask or camouflage their autistic traits, and including burnout education in suicide prevention programs. These findings highlight the need to reduce discrimination and stigma related to autism and disability.Background: Although autistic adults often discuss experiencing ''autistic burnout'' and attribute serious negative outcomes to it, the concept is almost completely absent from the academic and clinical literature.

        <p>A utistic burnout'' is often used by autistic adults to describe a state of incapacitation, exhaustion, and distress in every area of life. 1 Informally, autistic adults describe how burnout has cost them jobs, friends, activities, independence, mental and physical health, and pushed them to suicidal behavior. 1,2 The Twitter hashtag #AutisticBurnout produces hundreds of urgent messages among autistic people trying to understand, prevent, or recover from autistic burnout. Addressing autistic burnout is a high priority for autistic adults. 1,2 Despite how often and urgently the autistic community discusses autistic burnout, the concept is almost completely absent from the academic and clinical literature. A literature search for autism and burnout produces publications on family, teacher, caregiver, peer, and other burnout related to caring for or being around autistic people, [3][4][5][6] but no studies on burnout in autistic people themselves. Two recent clinical articles reference autistic burnout as an issue to be considered, 7,8 and only a few other recent articles casually mention burnout as a potential consequence of poor social support or masking (camouflaging one's self to conform to social pressures) or include it as research priority. [9][10][11][12] Without research to understand and characterize autistic burnout, it is difficult to provide clinicians, family members, autistic people, and others with effective tools to relieve or prevent it. Although autistic community members may have some shared understanding of the term ''autistic burnout,'' there is as of yet no clear agreed-upon definition of what constitutes autistic burnout. Moreover, it is unclear how well ''autistic burnout'' may relate to occupational burnout, 13 where presumably it gets its name. A casual look at some of the potential features of autistic burnout, as described by autistic adults in social media, raises the possibility that it is not a distinct construct, but just a manifestation of clinical depression, which shares features such as fatigue, decreased ability to think or concentrate, or suicidal ideation. 14 The goal of this study is to begin understanding what the community means by ''autistic burnout'': what characterizes it, how do people experience it, how might it be distinct (or not) from depression and occupational burnout, how it impacts people's lives, and whether anything can potentially be done to mitigate it.A utistic burnout'' is often used by autistic adults to describe a state of incapacitation, exhaustion, and distress in every area of life. 1 Informally, autistic adults describe how burnout has cost them jobs, friends, activities, independence, mental and physical health, and pushed them to suicidal behavior. 1,2 The Twitter hashtag #AutisticBurnout produces hundreds of urgent messages among autistic people trying to understand, prevent, or recover from autistic burnout.

        <p>We conducted a thematic analysis, 21 lensed through a critical paradigm. We used a hybrid inductive-deductive approach to analysis. Specifically, we used an inductive approach to characterize participants' experiences, define burnout, and understand how they conceptualized the causes and consequences of burnout. As we were interested in how people defined the term ''autistic burnout,'' rather than looking at what people called something we had already defined, we allowed others to define the term for themselves and did not actively seek alternative terms for similar experiences (though in some cases participants provided alternative language). However, given that depression and occupational burnout are already well described in the literature, we used a deductive approach to distinguish these concepts from participants' descriptions of autistic burnout. We conducted the analysis at both the semantic and latent levels, meaning that we took what people said both at face value and in deeper social context. We used

        </p>
        <p>The analysis included four iterations. First, to quickly build an initial code list, the PI (D.M.R.) and a nonautistic research assistant (M.S.) read the 10 burnout interviews and selected 5 representative interviews to share with the academic investigators (C.N., N.A.S., and A.R.T.). Everyone read one-fifth of the social media documents. They created an initial list of inductive codes from those materials. They then added a limited number of deductive codes related to known symptoms of depression and occupational burnout, based on the published literature on each, to explore potential intersections with those constructs.The analysis included four iterations.

        <p>For the second iteration, they shared the preliminary code list and their impressions of the data with the full AASPIRE CBPR team, who were asked whether they felt the initial codes sounded consistent with their experiences and community conversation (i.e., member checking). Based on this discussion, some codes were rephrased and new codes were added for items community partners felt came up a lot in community discussions but were not in the initial code list. Two of these added codes (physical health conditions, pets as a source of comfort) did not come up in the data. One added code, mental health treatment/therapy as a means of remediating burnout, came up, but in the context of a missing resource, a negative experience, or unrelated to burnout (e.g., for treating a co-occurring mental health condition). Four added codes came up in the data as important constructs but were later collapsed back into higher level themes (executive function difficulties, loss of instrumental activities of daily living, insufficient support for daily living needs, relationship of effort with reward); these four codes all capture important nuances related to the larger themes they ultimately grouped under. Autistic partners felt that the initially identified codes were consistent with community experience and did not recommend removing any.For the second iteration, they shared the preliminary code list and their impressions of the data with the full AASPIRE CBPR team, who were asked whether they felt the initial codes sounded consistent with their experiences and community conversation (i.e., member checking).

        <p>In the third iteration, two nonautistic undergraduate students (B.L. and A.D.S.), one of whom identifies as having a disability, and M.S. double-coded the corpus using the initial code list, but with freedom to add new themes should they emerge. The three met regularly with each other and with D.M.R. The coders discussed their findings and examined discrepancies in codes; they resolved discrepancies by describing their understanding of the text and discussing until they arrived at codes that fit their consensus interpretation of content. Once completed, D.M.R. collapsed the codes and discussed them with the academic investigators and the full CBPR team for insights and refinements.In the third iteration, two nonautistic undergraduate students (B.L. and A.D.S.), one of whom identifies as having a disability, and M.S. double-coded the corpus using the initial code list, but with freedom to add new themes should they emerge.

        <p>To help ensure trustworthiness of qualitative findings (the qualitative analogue to validation), we employed multiple coders and peer debriefing at multiple stages, and actively looked for contradictory data. Although there was general agreement on the experience of autistic burnout, details varied widely, as described in the Results section. One interview stood out as being more accurately described by the symptoms of depression. Discussions among coders involved sharing, in addition to academic lenses, reflections, and personal frames as people with a wide variety of lived experience with autism, mental health, and disability.To help ensure trustworthiness of qualitative findings (the qualitative analogue to validation), we employed multiple coders and peer debriefing at multiple stages, and actively looked for contradictory data.

        <p>When interpreting results, we first assessed the characteristics of autistic burnout; these were chronic exhaustion, loss of skills, and reduced tolerance to stimulus. We then looked for themes related to attributions of what caused the burnout; these were (1) life stressors (subthemes: masking, expectations, disability management, and life-changes) that lead to (2) cumulative load; (3) barriers to support (subthemes gaslighting/dismissal, poor boundaries/self-advocacy, cannot take a break, lack of external resources/support) that lead to (4) inability to obtain relief; all of which culminate in (5) expectations outweigh ability. We then created a definition of autistic burnout. Lastly, we examined impacts of autistic burnout and potential solutions. Impact themes were health, capacity for independent living, quality of life, and lack of empathy from neurotypical people. Potential solutions are summarized in Table 3.When interpreting results, we first assessed the characteristics of autistic burnout; these were chronic exhaustion, loss of skills, and reduced tolerance to stimulus.

        <p>Attribution themes fell under two broad categories of life stressors that added to the cumulative load experienced by participants, and barriers to support that created an inability to obtain relief from the cumulative load. These two pressures would then contribute to expectations outweighing abilities resulting in autistic burnout. Participants described this process bluntly; for example, ''Autistic burnout is a state of physical and mental fatigue, heightened stress, and diminished capacity to manage life skills, sensory input, and/or social interactions, which comes from years of being severely overtaxed by the strain of trying to live up to demands that are out of sync with our needs.''Attribution themes fell under two broad categories of life stressors that added to the cumulative load experienced by participants, and barriers to support that created an inability to obtain relief from the cumulative load.

        <p>Dealing honestly with scary and difficult emotions might actually be a way to prevent burnout. By allowing people to complain and be heard the difficulties can be overcome and the person is actually more likely to be able to put them aside and work again.

        <p>On a basic level, allowing periods of withdrawal, or decompression time at the end of the day, or even throughout the day can make a big difference. Take a spiritual retreat [laughs] like that's not a definite way of curing it but that's the only way I came up with is give yourself a break, withdraw into your own world and give yourself a break. The biggest thing of all you can give yourself, or your loved one, is time. Social withdrawal Allow yourself not to be sociable if you don't want to be. Give yourself permission to duck out of situations you can't cope with instead of pretending you can. I have gone through a few distinct periods of burnout and have successfully managed them by withdrawing from the world as best I could.On a basic level, allowing periods of withdrawal, or decompression time at the end of the day, or even throughout the day can make a big difference.

        <p>Expectations, especially around social pressures, also figured prominently and were interwoven with the masking theme, as masking was often a strategy used to meet family, social, vocational, or other mainstream expectations. Disability management encompassed strategies participants used to compensate for their autistic differences, often in nonaccommodating environments, such as overstimulating workplaces. Life-change stress-those unpredictable life events (e.g., death or moving), as well as more predictable but significant changes (e.g., transition to adulthood)-impacts everyone; however, for autistic people who may struggle with change (more so than the general population), these events were characterized by participants as requiring overwhelming amounts of energy to manage, often described as triggering a burnout episode. Many participants reported their first burnout experience occurring around the transition to adulthood. Together, these life stressors added to the cumulative load described in our data.Expectations, especially around social pressures, also figured prominently and were interwoven with the masking theme, as masking was often a strategy used to meet family, social, vocational, or other mainstream expectations.

        <p>Participants rarely attributed life-stresses alone as causing their burnout but juxtaposed them with an inability to get sufficient relief for those stresses. One of the most prominent subthemes was gaslighting (i.e., making the person question his or her own sense of reality) and dismissal; when people realized their life had become unsustainable and asked for help, they were told their troubles were their own fault or dismissed (e.g., ''that happens to everyone'').

        <p>Participants also related struggling with boundaries-for example, not understanding that they were able to say ''no'' to tasks or expectations, how to negotiate their own limits with external demands-or understanding how to selfadvocate; for example, ''[I] don't have the words to describe to anybody what's going on or to ask for help.'' People also talked about not being able to take breaks from particularly stressful aspects of their life, or not having access to external support or resources such as disability services, effective therapy, child care respite, or even a diagnosis; many people related having received their autism diagnosis as a result of losing compensation skills during their burnout. Together, these barriers to support contributed to the inability to obtain relief or recoup the energy debt described in our data.Participants also related struggling with boundaries-for example, not understanding that they were able to say ''no'' to tasks or expectations, how to negotiate their own limits with external demands-or understanding how to selfadvocate; for example, ''[I] don't have the words to describe to anybody what's going on or to ask for help.''

        <p>This theme appeared more often, and more dominantly, than any others throughout the corpus. Our conceptual model is an attempt to summarize the attributions described by participants and social media writers as funneling into the tipping point where expectations outweighed abilities and autistic burnout occurred. In other words, autistic burnout occurred when the persons felt what they needed to do became more than what was able to do given the combination of their existing resources, the cumulative load they were carrying, and their ability to replenish resources or access support. As one participant explained: ''Don't expect us to keep operating at above-peak level. We're like a light sedan car that's driven like a semi diesel hauler.we burn out when over-done.'' Participants described how these attributions came together through the expectation/ability mismatch to trigger autistic burnout: I had this internal switch that would flip under constant, unrelenting stress. At this point, I had felt susceptible to fur-ther belittlement and inquiries from authority. I wanted a place to hide, to recuperate. That is not the way of the world, unfortunately. It's being drained, wounded to such an incredible degree-like your battery has run dry.This theme appeared more often, and more dominantly, than any others throughout the corpus.

        <p>Our study found that ''autistic burnout'' is a term used consistently by autistic adults to describe their experience of a long-lasting pervasive state of exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus that is conceptualized as resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports. This experience was generally ill-understood by others and often dismissed, which made seeking help or relief difficult, and eroded self-esteem and self-efficacy. It had substantial impact on people's lives, often resulting in loss of vocation, health, and quality of life, and, at times, leading to suicidal behavior. Despite these distressing findings, participants also articulated ways they had gotten themselves out of burnout, and ideas for how to prevent it. This suggests potential to develop individual and systems-level interventions for prevention and recovery.Our study found that ''autistic burnout'' is a term used consistently by autistic adults to describe their experience of a long-lasting pervasive state of exhaustion, loss of function, and reduced tolerance to stimulus that is conceptualized as resulting from chronic life stress and a mismatch of expectations and abilities without adequate supports.

        <p>Although autistic burnout has not been described in the literature, workplace burnout is well researched. The literature on occupational burnout describes a response to chronic stress in an employment situation, including ''overwhelming exhaustion; feelings of cynicism and detachment from the job; and a sense of ineffectiveness and failure'' 13 with resulting impairment of both personal and interpersonal functioning including depression. 24 Researchers disagree on the validity of existing burnout measures 25 some argue for allowing participants to define burnout for themselves. 26 As with autistic burnout, systematic research on workplace burnout followed the vernacular popularization of the term among those who had experienced adverse impacts from stressful work situations where demands outpace available resources to meet those demands, specifically in the fields of human services, education, and health care. 13 Descriptions of autistic burnout share some superficial similarities to depression; however, we strongly believe it is a distinct condition. Some key characteristics of depression, such as anhedonia and sleep problems, were outliers in our data, and some participants who had a co-occurring depressive disorder diagnosis made an explicit note of how their experience of autistic burnout was different from an episode of depression. Several felt that autistic burnout contributed to subsequent onset or relapse of depression.Although autistic burnout has not been described in the literature, workplace burnout is well researched.

        <p>Some autistic adults in our data referred to their burnout as ''autistic regression.'' The term is most commonly used to describe children who appear to lose skills and ''become'' autistic after seeming to develop normally 27,28 ; however, the community of autistic adults and others have used it to describe periods of skills loss, while also finding the term problematic and inappropriate since it is applied to children and implies going backwards. 29 We advise using ''autistic burnout'' for the phenomena described in our data. Unlike autistic regression, loss of skills is only one component of burnout.Some autistic adults in our data referred to their burnout as ''autistic regression.''

        <p>A new literature has been emerging on masking in autism as a common if costly strategy to avoid the stigma, discrimination, lack of accommodation, and belittling often experienced by autistic people. Multiple studies have found increased masking associated with increased depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges. [30][31][32] A recent study found correlations between increased masking and suicidality. 33 Although masking comes with social and other rewards, it also comes with deep risks. A recent qualitative study delves deeply into reasons for, and consequences of, masking, which matched themes from our data (e.g., reasons like social pressure and the need to meet expectations; consequences like exhaustion and hiding one's true self). 34 Additional qualitative work supports these connections and further found them to be true regardless of whether or not a self-identified autistic person has a formal diagnosis. 9 Although masking is only one component in our findings, existing literature supports and reinforces the narratives of masking's role as a contributor to the cascade of factors that result in autistic burnout. Further interaction with masking research could be beneficial to understanding autistic burnout.A new literature has been emerging on masking in autism as a common if costly strategy to avoid the stigma, discrimination, lack of accommodation, and belittling often experienced by autistic people.

        <p>The potential link between autistic burnout and suicidality deserves special mention. Autistic adults have higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors than the general population. 35 Recent survey research suggests that both autism-specific and nonspecific factors may contribute to heightened suicide risk. 33 Our qualitative data point to autistic burnout fitting within this framework. Some life stressors and barriers to support that comprise autistic burnout are relatively specific to the autistic experience (for instance, overload from sensory stimuli). Others are relatively nonspecific but may occur more frequently and with more severity for autistic adults than the general population (for instance, lack of resources and stress from life transitions). Suicide risk assessment and management of suicide risk may be integrated into any intervention related to autistic burnout.The potential link between autistic burnout and suicidality deserves special mention.

        <p>This study has several limitations. It is a small qualitative study from a convenience sample and does not represent the full diversity of the autistic adult population. Although we were able to bring in more perspectives by using three data sources, future work would benefit from interviewing a wider range of participants, especially those who are not white, who have higher support needs, who are nonverbal, who are unable to ''pass'' for nonautistic, who have either very high or very low educational attainment, and who experience multiple marginalized identities. Although we specifically focused on autistic burnout, it is possible that people with other disabilities and people with chronic illnesses may experience burnout. Having only collected data from autistic adults, we cannot compare autistic burnout with burnout that might be experienced by other populations; however, this could be a fruitful area for further investigation. Despite these limitations, we feel our data display authenticity in that they represent a range of realities, provide a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena of interest, encompass contradictory viewpoints within an otherwise theme-saturated corpus, and suggest potential actions.This study has several limitations.

The findings reported here are from the first phase of a two-phase project, the second aim of which is to begin developing a measure of autistic burnout. In addition to our study-which was focused on autism and the term ''autistic burnout'' due to our focus as a CBPR collaborative and the nature of the funding we received-we strongly feel that further research is needed to examine whether this may be a generalized ''disability burnout''-or an even more generalized burnout experienced by others who experience similar dynamics of marginalization and burden in their lives.AASPIRE is continuing to examine autistic burnout.

        <p>As, to our knowledge, the first empirical study to examine autistic burnout, this study has numerous implications. Most notably, autistic burnout appears to be a definable phenomenon that substantially impacts people's lives and needs urgent attention. Participants described how engagement with the autistic adult community to name and validate their experience helped them recover. Thus, it may be important to educate autistic adults about autistic burnout. For therapists and other practitioners, these findings have implications related to recognizing autistic burnout in clients, validating their experience, and offering strategies for relief. Our data underscores the potential dangers of teaching autistic people to mask or suppress their autistic traits, or to push themselves to meet mainstream expectations. In addition, suicide prevention programs need to consider the potential role of burnout, as programs focused primarily on recognizing and treating depression or increasing social support may not adequately address an important pathway to suicide. Systems-level implications include reducing discrimination and stigma related to autism and disability, and working toward accommodations and acceptance to decrease the risk of autistic burnout. Lastly, more research is needed to further understand and measure autistic burnout, as well as to develop and test ways to relieve and prevent it.As, to our knowledge, the first empirical study to examine autistic burnout, this study has numerous implications.
