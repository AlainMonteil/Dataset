        <p>A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the external sensory environment is represented in the cortex. In the thermal system, at present there is no consensus on how or where sensory information is encoded in the cortex. One model is that cool and warm are processed by functionally and anatomically segregated circuits, following labelled-line principles seen in primary sensory afferent neurons and spinal circuits [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] resulting in cool-and warm-selective cortical neurons (Fig. 1a, top). Another is that cool and warm are integrated in the thermal pathway resulting in cortical neurons with a continuous, graded representation of temperature (Fig. 1a, bottom). Testing these models requires the identification of thermally responsive neurons in the cortex.A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the external sensory environment is represented in the cortex.

        <p>Psychophysical studies have shown that cooling and warming elicit distinct sensations, influenced by stimulus amplitude, duration, dynamics, body part and adapted skin temperature 2,18 . Analogously to other modalities, these features should be represented in a cortical region dedicated to thermal processing. Moreover, manipulation of its activity should influence thermal perception. A number of cortical regions have been suggested to be involved in thermal processing, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) [6][7][8] and the pIC 5,19,20 (Fig. 1b). However, no study has identified a cortical area with a cellular representation of cool and warm and a reversible impact on perception.Psychophysical studies have shown that cooling and warming elicit distinct sensations, influenced by stimulus amplitude, duration, dynamics, body part and adapted skin temperature 2,18 .

        <p>To examine thermal processing in S1 and pIC, we carried out widefield calcium imaging through a glass window in paw-tethered, awake mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in cortical excitatory neurons (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1). We presented an 8-kHz acoustic stimulus to locate the anterior auditory field in the auditory cortex and the small auditory insular field that border the somatosensory regions of pIC [21][22][23] , and went on to carry out post hoc histology (Extended Data Fig. 1). Next, we delivered 2-s thermal stimuli to the forepaw glabrous skin through a Peltier element held at an adapted temperature (AT) of 32 °C. Whereas 10 °C (32 °C to 22 °C) cooling stimuli triggered reliable changes in fluorescence in S1, 10 °C warming (32 °C to 42 °C) did not (Fig. 1d). By contrast, both cooling and warming stimuli triggered robust, large-amplitude responses in pIC (Fig. 1e). Local pharmacological inactivation of either S1 or pIC during imaging abolished the thermal response in the injected region but not in the untreated region (Fig. 1f,g), indicating that pIC and S1 receive parallel streams of thermal input.To examine thermal processing in S1 and pIC, we carried out widefield calcium imaging through a glass window in paw-tethered, awake mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in cortical excitatory neurons (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 1).

        <p>Perceptual thresholds for cool and warm covary across the body 24 , suggesting that some body parts have a stronger cortical representation than others. Widefield calcium imaging of pIC showed a clear somatotopic arrangement of thermal and tactile responses anterior to the auditory cortex in all mice (Fig. 1h) with the face represented in a region anterior and ventral to the forepaw, which in turn is anterior to the hindpaw (Fig. 1h). In all mice, the forepaw had a larger-amplitude response to thermal stimuli than the hindpaw, perhaps reflecting the dominant role of the forepaw in haptic exploration (Fig. 1i). Whereas responses to cooling and touch spatially overlap in S1 (Extended Data Fig. 2; ref. 7 ), they seem more separate in pIC (Fig. 1h). For all body parts tested, warming responses in pIC were delayed compared to cooling responses, suggesting that neural response latency is a hardwired property of the thermal system (Fig. 1j).Perceptual thresholds for cool and warm covary across the body 24 , suggesting that some body parts have a stronger cortical representation than others.

        <p>Cooling and warming widefield responses in pIC overlap spatially (Fig. 1e,h). This could result from an intermingled distribution of highly tuned or broadly tuned neurons (Fig. 2a). To determine the thermal tuning of cortical neurons, we went on to carry out two-photon calcium imaging of pIC excitatory neurons in awake mice and observed robust cellular responses to cooling and warming (Fig. 2b-d). We went on to plot the normalized responses according to a thermal bias index that describes the relative response strength to cooling compared to warming, with a value of -1 indicating a cool-only cell and +1 indicating a warm-only cell (Fig. 2d,e). The index had a U-shaped distribution, suggesting that segregated channels of tuned input drive cool and warm responses, and showed a similar probability of highly tuned neurons (cool only or warm only) and broadly tuned neurons (cool and warm responsive). In line with widefield data, most neurons in S1 were tuned to cooling only and only a tiny fraction responded to warming with delayed and inconsistent responses (Figs. 2e and3c and Extended Data Fig. 3).Cooling and warming widefield responses in pIC overlap spatially (Fig. 1e,h).

        <p>The spatial distribution of cortical neurons with respect to their functional properties is an important feature of cortical information processing [25][26][27] . To address whether pIC was organized thermotopically, we analysed the spatial distribution of thermally tuned neurons in pIC (Fig. 2f,g). Visual inspection showed a heterogeneous arrangement of thermally responsive neurons (Fig. 2f). In agreement, the distance between similarly tuned neurons (cool to cool; warm to warm) was not significantly different to the distance between differently tuned neurons (cool to warm; Fig. 2g). In a subset of experiments, we also used tactile stimulation and, in line with the differing spatial arrangements of touch and temperature, we observed a smaller fraction of thermally responsive pIC neurons (3%) than S1 neurons (12%) that responded to both thermal and tactile stimuli (Extended Data Fig. 3). Thus, thermal zones of pIC contain a heterogeneous, salt-pepper-like, arrangement of thermally responsive neurons.The spatial distribution of cortical neurons with respect to their functional properties is an important feature of cortical information processing [25][26][27] .

        <p>The skin contains discrete spots that evoke cool or warm sensations [1][2][3] . Notably, in vivo recordings from sensory afferent neurons, which innervate thermal spots, have shown distinct response dynamics to thermal stimuli, with short-latency, transient cool response mediated by Aδ-fibres, and longer-latency, sustained firing in response to cool and warm stimuli by C-fibres [11][12][13][14] . We went on to investigate whether distinct temporal dynamics between cool and warm were also present in cortical responses (Fig. 3a). In remarkable similarity to the case for the periphery, a grand average of all significant cool and warm responding neurons (see Methods) in pIC showed a shorter-latency (about 80 ms) and more transient cool response compared to a longer-latency (about 320 ms) and more sustained warm response (Fig. 3b). The latency difference is present in both tuned and broadly tuned neurons (Fig. 3c), suggesting that thermal responses are driven by similar input. Moreover, the cool response latency in S1 is similar to that in pIC, whereas the sparse warm responses in S1 are substantially delayed and more variable compared to pIC warm responses (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 3). We quantified the temporal dynamics of the thermal responses in pIC by computing a duration index that measures the change in response level at the end of the stimulation period compared to the initial peak value (Fig. 3d). The bimodality of the distribution of duration index for cool responses suggests a transient and a sustained response type (Fig. 3d). Similar results were observed for S1 cool responses (Extended Data Fig. 4). By contrast, pIC warm responses show a broad distribution of sustained responses (Fig. 3d). Plotting the duration index against the response latency showed that most cool transient neurons have a short-latency onset, whereas both cool and warm sustained neurons show delayed onsets (Fig. 3e). In broadly tuned neurons, we observed a similar distribution of cool and warm dynamics with cool transient and warm sustained responses in the same neurons (Fig. 3f), together highlighting that response dynamics are governed by sensory input rather than intrinsic cellular properties.The skin contains discrete spots that evoke cool or warm sensations [1][2][3] .

        <p>Fast-onset, transient neuronal responses are thought to be reliable indicators of stimulus change, whereas sustained responses are optimal for absolute stimulus level encoding. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the decrease in response amplitude when a thermal stimulus is presented with different onset rates (adaption index in Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4). We observed that cool transient neurons were not activated by stimuli with a slow onset whereas sustained neurons responded similarly irrespective of the stimulus onset speed. These features were observed in highly tuned and broadly tuned pIC neurons and also in S1 cool neurons (Extended Data Fig. 4). Overall, these data support a classic model of thermal encoding 2,3 , whereby cool responses are driven by a combination of fast Aδ-fibre and slow C-fibre afferent input and warm by slower C-fibre input [11][12][13][14]18 (Fig. 3h).Fast-onset, transient neuronal responses are thought to be reliable indicators of stimulus change, whereas sustained responses are optimal for absolute stimulus level encoding.

        <p>The amplitude of a sensory stimulus can be encoded in different ways: by neurons with specific preferred amplitude values; the recruiting of more neurons as amplitude increases; graded rate coding (Fig. 4a).The amplitude of a sensory stimulus can be encoded in different ways: by neurons with specific preferred amplitude values; the recruiting of more neurons as amplitude increases; graded rate coding (Fig. 4a).</p>
        <p>To address this in the thermal system, we measured single-cell responses in pIC to different amplitude cooling and warming stimuli (Fig. 4b) and show that responses to different amplitudes were reliable within a neuron, but diverse between neurons (Fig. 4c). Plotting the population response amplitude showed an asymmetric response profile with a steeper curve for cooling and more graded for warming (Fig. 4d). Similar data acquired in S1 showed a weak cellular representation of warm amplitudes (Fig. 4d, grey line). In pIC, most cool neurons respond to the smallest amplitude tested (2 °C) with only a minority recruited at larger amplitudes, whereas the number of activated warm neurons more gradually follows the increase of stimulus amplitude (Fig. 4e).To address this in the thermal system, we measured single-cell responses in pIC to different amplitude cooling and warming stimuli (Fig. 4b) and show that responses to different amplitudes were reliable within a neuron, but diverse between neurons (Fig. 4c).

        <p>The proportion of cool neurons reaching the maximal response amplitude is graded with stimulus amplitude, whereas warm neurons reach their maximum response amplitude only with large-amplitude stimuli (Fig. 4f). Overall, these analyses suggest that the encoding scheme for thermal amplitude is a combination of extra recruitment of neurons and graded changes of response amplitude. Among the neurons that responded significantly to warming, about 5% showed an unexpected response profile with thermometer-like properties, responding to small-but not large-amplitude cooling. These 'thermometer neurons' showed graded reporting of absolute thermal value, independent of the stimulus direction from the AT (Fig. 4c, neuron no. 5, and Extended Data Fig. 5).The proportion of cool neurons reaching the maximal response amplitude is graded with stimulus amplitude, whereas warm neurons reach their maximum response amplitude only with large-amplitude stimuli (Fig. 4f).

        <p>The thermal responses of primary sensory afferent neurons and spinal cord neurons are influenced by the skin AT [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] , but whether this is reflected by a change in cortical response amplitude is not known. To investigate this, we compared pIC cellular responses to stimuli of the same amplitude but from ATs of 22 and 26 °C (Fig. 4g). At lower ATs, warming stimulus amplitude had to be substantially increased to observe response amplitudes comparable to those seen at AT 32 °C, and responses were often observed only once the stimulus target temperature reached 34 °C. By contrast, reliable responses to cooling were observed for all target temperatures and ATs tested (Fig. 4h). This difference was highlighted by plotting the response amplitude against the relative stimulus amplitude, which showed a shift in the warm response curve, but not in the cool (Fig. 4i, consistent conclusions were also observed in widefield imaging data in Extended Data Fig. 6). Together these data indicate that cooling and warming amplitude is encoded in fundamentally different ways in the cortex, with warming dependent on the absolute temperature and cooling reflecting the magnitude of temperature change, consistent with findings in primary sensory afferent neurons and spinal cord neurons [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] .The thermal responses of primary sensory afferent neurons and spinal cord neurons are influenced by the skin AT [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] , but whether this is reflected by a change in cortical response amplitude is not known.

        <p>To address this, we carried out optogenetic manipulations during a go/ no-go thermal detection task (Fig. 5a). Thermal stimuli were delivered at random times from AT 32 °C. VGAT-ChR2 mice, with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) constitutively expressed in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, were implanted with an optical window over pIC and provided with water rewards on licking a water spout during the onset ramp or plateau phase of the stimulus (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 7). Owing to differences in sensitivity to cooling and warming in pIC (Fig. 4), we chose 10 °C, 2 °C, 1 °C and 0.5 °C cooling stimuli, whereas for warming we used 10 °C, 8 °C, 6 °C and 4 °C. Mice were able to report stimuli at all amplitudes, highlighting their acute thermal perceptual ability (Fig. 5b,c). As for the functional responses (Figs. 1 and3), mice reported warming at longer latencies than for cooling. We went on to inhibit the activity of pIC during the stimulus phase in the same mice (Fig. 5a,e) using light pulses (12.5 mW, 20 Hz, 2 s) through a 200-μm fibre optic positioned normal to the thermal region of pIC (Fig. 5a,e). In cooling-trained mice, optogenetic inhibition of pIC suppressed the hit rates to 2 °C, 1 °C and 0.5 °C stimuli but not to 10 °C (Fig. 5e), whereas, in warming-trained mice, optogenetic inhibition suppressed the hit rates to all amplitudes (Fig. 5e). Optical stimulation efficiently inhibited neuronal responses driven by thermal stimuli in pIC (Extended Data Fig. 7). Moreover, repeating the same optical stimulation paradigm but in Thy1-GCaMP6s mice not expressing ChR2 showed no effect on thermal perception (bottom panels Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 7), confirming that the light alone does not alter the behaviour of the mice in our task. We next tested whether the differential impact of optogenetic inhibition of warming and cooling perception resulted from the additional representation of cool in S1. We found that the impact of optogenetic inhibition of S1 is weaker compared to that of pIC (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 7), supporting the hypothesis that pIC is the central representation of temperature and could be explained by differences in cortical area size, local cellular architecture and projection targets. As expected, simultaneous optogenetic inhibition of S1 and pIC using fibre optics positioned directly over pIC and S1 had a more pronounced effect on warm and cool perception than inhibiting S1 alone (Extended Data Fig. 7), but was similar to the impact of inhibiting pIC alone (Fig. 5e). Notably, even during dual inhibition, mice were still able to detect 10 °C cooling. This could result from the fast onset of cool responses providing a more robust encoding strategy or perhaps reflect the recruitment of different upstream circuits.

Moreover, optogenetic inhibition of pIC in VGAT-ChR2 mice trained to discriminate between an acoustic stimulus (go; rewarded) versus an acoustic stimulus presented simultaneously with a thermal stimulus (no-go; not rewarded) induced a selective increase of licking during the no-go trials, showing that pIC manipulation has an impact on perception rather than causing a general decrease of licking (Extended Data Fig. 8). Taken together, our behavioural data show that pIC plays a profound role in thermal perception.Optogenetic inhibition of pIC in VGAT-ChR2 mice during spontaneous licking of free water rewards and during an acoustic detection task did not alter lick rates (Extended Data Fig. 8).

        <p>Here we identify a cortical region required for non-painful thermal perception and support the hypothesis that pIC houses a thermal cortex. Our data show that humans, monkeys and rodents therefore share not only similar perceptual abilities 18,24,33 , but also a cortical area (pIC) specialized in temperature processing, putting the thermosensory system of mammals closer than previously thought 5,34 . Moreover, we observed distinct encoding features of cool and warm in the cortex. The representation of warm has delayed and uniform dynamics that encodes absolute stimulus amplitude, compared to the mixed temporal dynamics for cool that drive a relative encoding of stimulus amplitude. Similar features have been reported in primate and human primary thermal afferent neurons [11][12][13][14] and closely resemble thermal response features in Drosophila central and peripheral neurons 35,36 , together highlighting the conserved nature of thermal encoding across the animal kingdom.Here we identify a cortical region required for non-painful thermal perception and support the hypothesis that pIC houses a thermal cortex.

        <p>We find that cool and warm are represented in the cortex in a labelled-line-like fashion resembling sensory afferent encoding proprieties (Fig. 1a, top) [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] . Nevertheless, cortical neurons can also show response profiles not observed in the periphery, such as the encoding of temperature by thermometer neurons, raising the possibility of complex thermal features being generated in the cortex (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5). The presence of distinct features of cool and warm responses both in broadly and tightly tuned pIC neurons shows that functionally segregated streams of afferent information can merge in cortical neurons. This is interesting in light of recent data suggesting interactions between warm and cool afferent pathways 18 and findings from the tactile pathway that suggest substantial subcortical transformation of tactile information before reaching S1 (ref. 37 ). Our findings will allow future research studies to examine the separation and integration of different channels of sensory afferent input on the cortical encoding of temperature.We find that cool and warm are represented in the cortex in a labelled-line-like fashion resembling sensory afferent encoding proprieties (Fig. 1a, top) [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] .

        <p>Touch and cool response areas overlap in S1 (ref. 7 ), whereas they seem more separate in pIC, hinting at differences both in the sensory input and functional output of these regions. Objects are normally cooler than skin temperature and thermal conductivity is an important component of object identification 38 . One hypothesis is that S1 integrates cool with touch during haptic sensing, whereas pIC encodes the thermal identity (warm versus cool) and level forming an independent and complete representation of thermosensation. The discovery of an optically accessible cortical representation of temperature provides a platform to address the neural mechanisms of non-painful thermal perception, as well as pain evoked during noxious stimulation, allodynia and thermal illusions.Touch and cool response areas overlap in S1 (ref. 7 ), whereas they seem more separate in pIC, hinting at differences both in the sensory input and functional output of these regions.

        <p>To implant a window over pIC, mice were anaesthetized as above, and then the parietal and temporal bones of the left hemisphere were exposed and the left temporalis muscle was carefully separated from the temporal bone and partially removed. An approximately 3 × 3 mm craniotomy was carried out over pIC as identified by local anatomical landmarks (rhinal vein, middle cerebral artery, zygomatic bone). To implant a window over primary somatosensory forepaw cortex (S1) a 3-mm-diameter craniotomy was carried out over the left hemisphere S1 identified by the anatomical location respect to bregma (1.5-2.5 mm lateral and 0.5-1 mm anterior). To implant windows over pIC and S1 in the same mouse, we carried out two 3-mm craniotomies.

        <p>Thermal. For widefield imaging, behavioural and electrophysiological experiments, thermal stimuli were delivered by an 8 × 8 mm Peltier element regulated by a feedback-controlled stimulator (Yale Medical School or a custom-made device, ESYS GmbH Berlin). Different thermal stimuli (2-s duration with an onset ramp speed of 20 °C s -1 ) were interleaved randomly and delivered every 30 or 60 s. During paw stimulation, we took care to place the forepaw or hindpaw pad glabrous skin into direct contact with the centre of the Peltier element. During face stimulation, the Peltier surface was positioned on the orofacial region of the snout. For single-cell two-photon experiments, thermal stimuli were delivered using a Peltier-based thermal stimulator (QST-lab).

        <p>Setup. Imaging was carried out with a Leica MZ10F stereomicroscope. Blue excitation light (470 nm) was emitted from a LED (pE-300, CoolLED) and bandpass filtered (470/40 nm). Emission light was bandpass filtered (525/50 nm) before recording with a scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor camera (ORCA-Flash4.O LT, Hamamatsu). Images were acquired at a rate of 20 Hz and 35 ms exposure time. Frame size was 1,024 × 1,024 pixels (2 × 2 binning); for cranial window preparation the field of view was about 2.7 × 2.7 mm and for the cleared skull preparation the field of view was about 6.7 × 6.7 mm. Acquisition trials lasted 10-15 s and had an inter-trial-interval time of 30-60 s. During pIC imaging, animals were tilted to allow optical access. As a result of physical constraints, pIC and S1 widefield imaging was carried out in different animals and sessions, except during the cortical pharmacological inactivation experiments (Fig. 1f,g). In this case, we used a 'clear skull' preparation and imaged pIC and S1 simultaneously. The setup was always adjusted to allow the paw to be placed in a similar position to all other experiments.

        <p>Widefield image analysis. Videos were motion corrected, and areas in the recordings outside the brain were masked. We calculated the relative change in fluorescence as ΔF/F = (F(t) - F 0 )/F 0 , in which F 0 is the 15th percentile of the activity in the trial. The average activity of the last 500 ms before stimulus was subtracted from ΔF/F. The activity of a given region was quantified by averaging the fluorescence in a region of interest (ROI; diameter 15 pixels) before calculating ΔF/F. When placing ROIs, we avoided visible blood vessels, but otherwise positioned the ROI at the area with the peak stimulus-driven response. The ROI positions were kept the same over days and recording sessions by comparing the position relative to the blood vessels. Auditory stimuli activated several fields in the auditory cortex and one area in pIC (insular auditory field). Somatotopic maps. Somatotopic maps of sensory input to pIC (Fig. 1) and S1 (Extended Data Fig. 2) are grand averages across mice and trials. Not all stimuli were delivered to all mice. Using the ROI of the thermal forepaw response as a reference location, ΔF/F videos for all trials were aligned by translation. The grand averages were smoothed with Gaussian filter (σ = 20 pixels) and thresholded to show only peak activity (&gt;85% of the maximum activity for thermal and &gt;90% for tactile stimulation).

            <rs type="version">4.0.2019.8191</rs>, 
            <rs type="creator">Thorlabs</rs>). In most experiments the microscope was rotated by 45° from vertical. Owing to physical constraints, pIC and S1 two-photon imaging was carried out in different animals and sessions. The excitation laser (InSight DeepSee, Spectra-Physics) was tuned to 940 nm, and the power never exceeded 100 mW. Emitted photons were bandpass filtered 525/50 (green) onto a GaAsP photomultiplier tube. Multi-plane (512 × 512 pixels) acquisition was controlled by a fast piezoelectric objective scanner, with planes spaced 45 μm apart in depth. Seven planes were acquired sequentially, and the scanning of the entire stack was repeated at about 5 Hz. Beam turnarounds at the edges of the image were blanked. Acquisition trials lasted 26 s and had an inter-trial interval of 30-60 s. Stimuli generation and hardware synchronization were carried out on a computer with a

        <p>Criteria for responsive neurons. Neurons with a significant increase in activity to 10 °C cooling and warming stimuli were included for further analysis. Cool and warm neurons were defined as those significantly responding to either 10 °C cooling or warming stimuli. Broadly tuned neurons had significant response to both cooling and warming stimuli. To identify an increase in response amplitude, the activity in a time window before stimulus onset was compared with the activity in a time window during stimulus. A neuron was identified as being responsive if the change in activity was significantly larger (estimated by bootstrapping) than two times the noise level of the neuron measured by the interquartile range of activity before the stimuli.Criteria for responsive neurons.

        <p>Setup. Head-fixed mice (VGAT-ChR2 and Thy1-GCaMP6s) were implanted with a glass window over pIC and trained on a go/no-go stimulus detection paradigm. Mice were rewarded with a water drop (about 2 μl) if they reported a randomly timed thermal stimulus with at least one lick of a water spout (capacitance sensor) within a window of opportunity (from the start of thermal stimulus to start of offset ramp). Correct rejections were not rewarded and incorrect responses were not punished, although premature licking in the 5 s before the stimulus onset would postpone the next trial by 5 s. Mice were water restricted and their weight was monitored daily. For behavioural training, a 200-μm-diameter, 0.22-NA optic fibre (Thorlabs) was coupled to an LED (470 Plexon LED source) and placed on the coverslip surface orthogonal to the thermal region of the pIC or S1 using the blood vessel pattern. In a subset of mice, cranial windows were implanted above both S1 and pIC, and LEDs were placed above both areas (Extended Data Fig. 7).

        <p>Free licking. To monitor the impact of pIC optogenetic manipulation on licking behaviour, water restricted mice were allowed to freely lick from a lick spout with continuous rewards. Licking rates during the 2 s before the onset of the light stimulus (Off) were compared with those during the 2 s after the onset of the light stimulus (On). Light stimuli were delivered for 5 s at 12.5 mW, 20 Hz and 50% duty cycle (Extended Data Fig. 8).Free licking.

        <p>Mice were randomly allocated to be trained first to report cooling or warming. In a second training round, they were trained to report the opposite stimulus. Data measuring the thermal perceptual ability of mice without optogenetic manipulation (Fig. 5b-d) were generated from the same mice used in optogenetic manipulations (Fig. 5e,f), the day before optogenetic testing. The effect of the optogenetic manipulation (bottom panels of Fig. 5e,f and Extended Data Fig. 7) was quantified by the mean change in the percentage of lick trials.Mice were randomly allocated to be trained first to report cooling or warming.

        <p>Electrophysiological recordings for measuring the impact of optogenetic inhibition on thermal responses were carried out in VGAT-ChR2 mice implanted with a head post. Mice were habituated for head and paw fixation. On the day of the recording, the mouse was briefly anaesthetized (about 30 min, 1% isoflurane) and a craniotomy of about 2 mm diameter was carried out over the pIC. The dura was removed in the ventral part of the craniotomy and the brain was covered with Kwik-Cast silicon (World Precision Instruments). The animal was placed in its home cage to recover from anaesthesia for at least 2-3 h before head fixation in the recording setup.Electrophysiological recordings for measuring the impact of optogenetic inhibition on thermal responses were carried out in VGAT-ChR2 mice implanted with a head post.

        <p>We carried out 7 recordings in 4 mice using 32-channel silicon probes (Neuronexus) in either a linear or four-shank 'Buzsaki32' configuration. In some experiments, the tips of the probe were covered with DiI (Sigma). The probe was inserted orthogonal to the pIC with a micromanipulator (Luigs&amp;Neumann) at 1-2 μm s -1 . Recordings were acquired at 30 kHz with a Neuralynx system (Cheetah). The extracellular recordings were spike sorted using 
            <rs type="software">Kilosort</rs> (version 
            <rs type="version">2</rs>) 43 . The data were collected to evaluate the effect of ChR2 on neural activity, so we carried out limited manual sorting to exclude obvious noise but did not take any steps to exclude multi-unit activity. Units with a mean activity during stimulus representation exceeding a threshold of 2 s.d. above the background were considered to be thermally responsive.

        <p>To label the thermal cortical representation, animals were deeply anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. The centre of the response area was marked with a glass pipette painted with fluorescent dye (DiI, 5 mg ml -1 ). Mice were then perfused transcardially using cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.4) and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA; 2% in 0.1 M PBS). The brain was removed and kept for 1-5 h in 2% PFA. After washing with PBS, the hemispheres were separated and cortices were removed and flattened between two glass slides separated by a spacer of 1-2 mm. Glass slides were weighed down for approximately 3-8 h at 4 °C in 2% PFA. After washing with PBS, 70-80-μm sections were cut on a Vibratome (Leica VT1000s). Sections were stained for cytochrome oxidase activity (2 mg cytochrome c, 6 mg diaminobenzidine). After the staining procedure, sections were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol mounting medium. Images were acquired with a Zeiss microscope (AX10) using a 5× objective and processed using

Coronal sections of 50 μm in thickness of PFA-fixed mouse brains were stained for 48 h with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-Gad67 (catalogue number MAB5406; clone 1G10.2; Millipore; 1:800); chicken anti-GFP (catalogue number ab13970; Abcam; 1:250); mouse anti-NeuN (catalogue number MAB377; clone A60; Millipore; 1:100). The secondary antibodies Cy3 goat anti-mouse (A-21422; Invitrogen; 1:250) and A488 goat anti-chicken (A-11039; Invitrogen; 1:250) were incubated for a few hours at room temperature.
