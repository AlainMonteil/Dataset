        <p>The process of cancer immunosurveillance is a mechanism of tumor suppression that can protect the host from cancer development throughout its lifetime 1,2 . Yet, it is unknown whether its effectiveness fluctuates over a single day. Here, we demonstrate that the initial time-of-day of tumor engraftment dictates ensuing tumor size across murine cancer models. Using immunodeficient mice and animals lacking lineagespecific circadian functions, we show that dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 + T cells exert circadian anti-tumor functions that control melanoma volume. Specifically, we find that rhythmic trafficking of DCs to the tumor draining lymph node (dLN) governs a circadian response of tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, which is dependent on circadian expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80. Consequently, cancer immunotherapy is more effective when synchronized with DC functions, shows circadian outcomes in mice and suggests similar effects in humans. These data demonstrate that circadian rhythms of anti-tumor immune components are not only critical for the control of tumor size but can also be exploited therapeutically.</p>
        <p>The immune system provides sophisticated defense mechanisms that most often eliminate or contain the appearance of tumor cells in healthy tissue, and prevent the development of life-threatening cancers 1,2 . Both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity show circadian (~24h) rhythmicity in their response [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] , so that even weeks after an initial stimulus is encountered, time-of-day immune effects are still observed 11- 16 . There is evidence that cancer cells can exhibit a perturbation in their circadian clock components, which drives cancer development 17 . However, the impact of a rhythmic immune system on tumor surveillance, and the effectiveness of treatments involving the immune system, remain unknown. Here, we provide evidence that a circadian antitumor immune response controls tumor volume and the response to therapy.</p>
        <p>To explore whether tumor volume depends on the time-of-day of tumor cell engraftment, we injected B16-F10 melanoma cells expressing ovalbumin (B16-F10-OVA) subcutaneously (s.c.) into cohorts of mice at six different times of the day ((that is, at Zeitgeber time 1 (ZT1; 1 h after light onset in a 12h light / 12h dark environment; 'morning'), ZT5 ('midday'), ZT9 ('afternoon'), ZT13 ('evening'), ZT17 ('midnight') and ZT21 ('early morning')) and quantified tumor size over the ensuing two weeks. To control these data, animals were housed in distinct environmental light cabinets, 12h</p>
        <p>phase-shifted to each other, allowing the simultaneous injection of the same batch of tumor cells into differently-timed recipients. Tumor size was strongly affected by the time-of-day of engraftment, yielding significantly larger tumors when inoculated in the late night (ZT21), and smaller tumors when inoculated in the late afternoon (ZT9-ZT13)</p>
        <p>(Fig. 1a-b, Extended Data Fig. 1a). We observed similar results in two orthotopic mammary carcinoma models (E0771 and 4T1) (Extended Data Fig. 1b-d) and a murine colon carcinoma model (MC-38) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). This indicated that the time-of-day effect of engraftment on tumor size represented a phenomenon relevant across different tumor types and sites of engraftment. We further confirmed these data by quantitative imaging approaches with luciferase-expressing melanoma cells (B16-F10-OVA-Luc) (Extended Data Fig. 1f). Using B16-F10 melanoma cell lines that did or did not express OVA yielded very similar results (Extended Data Fig. 1g). This indicated that the observed time-of-day effect of inoculation represented a general phenotype not affected by potentially different immunogenicity of the tumor.</p>
        <p>Circadian rhythms are defined by their persistence in the absence of environmental entraining cues, such as rhythmic light onset and offset. Transferring animals to complete darkness conditions did not alter the observed time-of-day differences, demonstrating the effect to be bona fide circadian in nature (Fig. 1c). However, switching mice to a 12h inverted dark-light cycle inversed tumor size, demonstrating that the effect was not dependent on light per se but that it could be entrained by light, an additional feature of circadian rhythms (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1h).</p>
        <p>Subjecting mice to a jet-lag protocol (Extended Data Fig. 1h) abrogated time-of-day differences and increased tumors, indicating that acutely altering lighting regimes negatively affected disease outcome (Fig. 1d). Together, these data provide unexpected evidence that tumor size is highly governed by the initial time-of-day of engraftment, driven by circadian rhythms in the host, which are entrained by light.</p>
        <p>To assess whether these effects were dependent on the immune system, we injected B16-F10-OVA melanoma cells during the day (ZT9) or at night (ZT21) into NSG mice, which lack both adaptive and innate immune cells. Of importance, the previously observed dependency of tumor volume on time-of-day engraftment was abrogated in these mice, indicating the differences to be mediated by the immune system (Fig. 1e).</p>
        <p>To define which arm of immunity was involved, we utilized Rag2 -/-mice, which lack an adaptive immune system. Similar to NSG mice, time-of-day differences in tumor size were ablated in these animals, demonstrating the adaptive immune system to be critical in mediating the phenotype (Fig. 1e).</p>
        <p>We subsequently used flow cytometry to assess the immune cell infiltrates in tumors 14 days after inoculation. Tumors were harvested at ZT1, in order to limit variables to just the time of engraftment. Numbers of CD8 + T cells were dependent on the time of engraftment, with cellularity peaking when tumor inoculation occurred during the day (ZT9) and troughing at night (ZT21) (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2a). In contrast, the numbers of other leukocyte subsets were not affected (Extended Data Fig. 2b). To assess the functional relevance of rhythmicity in the tumor immune cell infiltrate, we used different antibodies to deplete specific subpopulations of leukocytes. Antibody-mediated depletion of CD8 + T cells or CD4 + T cells -but not of neutrophils -abrogated the time-of-day difference in tumor size (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2c-j). However, only depletion of CD8 + T cells increased tumor volume (Fig. 1g), while depletion of CD4 + T cells reduced it (Extended Data Fig. 2c). These results indicate CD8 + T cells to exert anti-tumorigenic effects in a time-of-day dependent manner.</p>
        <p>To explore the mechanisms controlling the time-of-day-dependent impact of CD8 + T cells on tumor size, we focused on the early events that potentially accounted for the observed effects. Using flow cytometry and quantitative imaging approaches to characterize the site of engraftment 4 hours after tumor inoculation, we found CD11c + MHCII + cells to represent the predominant leukocyte subset, with higher numbers of these cells when tumor cells were inoculated at ZT9 compared to ZT21 (Fig 2a-c and Extended Data Fig. 3a-c). Furthermore, 24h after tumor inoculation, we detected more leukocytes in draining lymph nodes (dLN) of mice in which tumor cells were inoculated at ZT9 compared to ZT21 (Extended Data Fig. 3d-e). Specifically, we observed more CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, including increased numbers of activated central memory (CD44 + CD62L + ) and na√Øve (CD44 -CD62L + ) T cells, following ZT9 tumor cell engraftment (Extended Data Fig. 3e-f). These dLNs also contained more CD11c + cells, including CD11b + CD11c + MHCII hi , CD103 + CD11c + MHCII hi , CD11b + CD11c + MHCII lo , and CD8 + CD11c + MHCII lo subsets (Extended Data Fig. 3g-i). This phenotype was also observed in the orthotopic mammary carcinoma as well as the colon carcinoma models (Extended Data Fig. 4a-g). Under sham conditions, time-of-day changes in the number of these cell types were observed but showed smaller differences (Extended Data Fig. 5a). To further identify relevant tumor-derived antigenpresenting cells (APCs) in the dLN, we used an antibody specific for SIINFEKL peptide bound to H-2K b (Extended Data Fig. 3h-i). We found that APCs presenting this antigen predominantly displayed a CD103 + CD11c + MHCII hi phenotype. These CD103 + CD11c + MHCII hi (SIINFEKL:H-2K b ) + cells were also more numerous in dLNs of mice inoculated with tumor cells at ZT9 (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3h-i).</p>
        <p>A</p>
        <p>This phenotype was also observed in the orthotopic E0771-OVA breast cancer model (Extended Data Fig. 4c-d). No differences were observed in the processing of OVAantigen in CD11c + cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b), suggesting that changes in levels of antigen presentation were not responsible for the phenotype.</p>
        <p>Using dextramer staining to detect endogenous T cells specific for H-2K b /SIINFEKL in the dLN 72h after tumor engraftment, we detected higher numbers and proportions of antigen-specific CD44 + CD8 + T cells, when tumor inoculation was performed at ZT9 compared to ZT21 in both the melanoma and mammary carcinoma models (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4e). We also observed significantly more EdU + CD8 + T cells and EdU + CD4 + T cells in the dLN 48h after tumor inoculation at ZT9 compared to ZT21, demonstrating a higher T cell proliferation rate following ZT9</p>
        <p>tumor inoculation (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5c). In an analogous manner, we performed dextramer staining to detect endogenous T cells specific for a peptide of the neoantigen Adpgk (H-2D b /ASMTNMELM), expressed by MC-38 colon carcinoma cells. We detected higher numbers of Adpgk + -neoantigen specific CD8 T cells in this tumor model in the dLN 72h after tumor engraftment when tumor inoculation was performed at ZT9 compared to ZT21 (Extended Data Fig. 4f-g). These data indicate a time-of-day-dependent generation of tumor antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in the dLN to OVA-antigen as well as neoantigen and similar mechanisms at play in a subcutaneous and orthotopic engraftment setting.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether differences were driven by immune cell intrinsic mechanisms, we used Cd4cre:Bmal1 flox mice, where the key circadian clock gene</p>
        <p>Bmal1 (encoded by Arntl) is specifically deleted in T cells (Bmal1 Tcell ), rendering them arrhythmic. Bmal1 Tcell mice showed similar kinetics of tumor volume when tumor cells were inoculated either at ZT9 or ZT21, demonstrating the importance of T cell-intrinsic rhythms in the control of tumor size (Fig. 2g). Similarly, Clec9acre:Bmal1 flox mice, which lack BMAL1 expression in conventional DCs (Bmal1 cDC ), showed comparable tumor size kinetics when tumor cells were inoculated either at ZT9 or ZT21 (Fig. 2h).</p>
        <p>This demonstrated BMAL1 and cell-autonomous circadian oscillations in both DCs and T cells to be critical for the time-of-day differences in tumor volume. Mechanistically, Bmal1 deletion in cDCs abrogated differences in total and antigen-specific DC numbers in the dLN after tumor engraftment, in contrast to control animals (Fig. 2i). Furthermore, dextramer staining in Bmal1 cDC mice revealed reduced antigen-specific CD8 + T cell levels and abrogated time-of-day differences (Fig. 2j). These data demonstrate DC and T cell autonomous circadian clocks to be responsible for the time-of-day-dependent anti-tumor effects, with DCs governing rhythmic CD8 + T cell responses.</p>
        <p>To obtain global information on DC changes after tumor inoculation at different times of the day, we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analyses of the subset of CD11c + MHCII hi migratory DCs in the dLN collected 24 hours after tumor engraftment or sham conditions, inoculated at ZT3, 9, 15 or 21. We observed strong time-of-day differences in overall gene expression, indicating differences in DC functionality. First, we found that CD11c + MHCII hi cells exhibited rhythmicity in the expression of clock genes and clock-controlled genes (Extended Data Fig. 6a), with the expression of these genes being sufficient to define the time of day from which the cells were derived (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Next, we detected two main clusters of oscillatory genes,</p>
        <p>one of which was expressed more highly in the morning (ZT9) and the other in the evening (ZT15) (Fig. 3a-b). Whereas the morning cluster consisted mainly of metabolic genes -with the exception of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 -the second cluster was highly enriched in T cell activation pathways (Fig. 3b-d, Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6c-d). In contrast, RNAseq analyes of CD11c + MHCII hi cells harvested from Bmal1 cDC mice showed altered rhythmicity, gene expression patterns and cellular pathways compared to controls (Fig. 3b,d, Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 7a-c). These data indicated that, in addition to differences in DC numbers, the rhythmicity in DC co-stimulatory factors that was specific for the tumor scenario (Extended Data Fig. 8a-c) could be responsible for the generation of rhythmic CD8 + T cell activation phenotypes.</p>
        <p>CD11c + subsets at the protein level by flow cytometry (Fig. 4b). To interrogate whether oscillations in CD80 were driven by a cell-autonomous circadian rhythm -independent of the environment as indicated by the RNAseq data (Fig. 4a) -we performed in vitro synchronization assays of immature as well as LPS-matured bone marrow-derived DC (BMDCs) using a serum shock 18,19 (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9a-c). We detected significant differences in Cd80 expression at different time points after BMDC synchronization (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9c). In contrast, we observed no circadian differences in the expression of various cytokines but rather a timerdependent progressive change through time (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Furthermore, circadian differences in Cd80 expression were abrogated in CD11c + MHCII hi cells harvested from Bmal1 cDC in vivo as well as BMDCs generated from mice lacking overall expression of circadian genes in vitro (Bmal1 -/-or Per1 -/-Per2 -/-) (Fig. 4a, c-d).</p>
        <p>To further test whether circadian rhythmicity in myeloid cells was necessary to control</p>
        <p>Cd80 expression, we assessed BMDCs produced from mice lacking BMAL1 specifically in myeloid cells (Lyz2cre:Bmal1 flox ; Bmal1 myeloid ); again, we found that loss of BMAL1 abrogated time-of-day differences in CD80 expression (Fig. 4e). Taken together, these findings indicate a critical role for the circadian clock machinery in controlling CD80 expression.</p>
        <p>To investigate whether the circadian rhythmicity in DC gene expression patterns had a functional and causal consequence on T cell activation, we performed co-culture experiments of synchronized, SIINFEKL-pulsed BMDCs with non-synchronized OVA-specific OT-I CD8 + T cells. This approach allowed us to observe that the rhythmicity of DCs directly controlled that of T cells. Indeed, the proliferation of OT-I CD8 + T cells was highly dependent on the rhythmic phase in which the DCs were located (Fig. 4f). BMDCs harvested 36h after synchronization induced stronger OT-I T cell proliferation than BMDCs harvested 24h after synchronization (Fig. 4f). In contrast, BMAL1-deficient BMDCs failed to induce rhythmic OT-I CD8 + T cell proliferation (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, treatment with an anti-CD80 antibody abrogated time-of-day differences in OT-I CD8 + T cell proliferation (Fig. 4h), demonstrating the relevance of CD80 in the rhythmic CD8 + T cell response.</p>
        <p>To specifically investigate the importance of rhythmicity in co-stimulatory signals provided by BMDCs, we performed co-culture experiments of synchronized, SIINFEKL-pulsed BMDCs with non-synchronized OVA-specific OT-I CD8 + T cells, as before, but bypassing MHCI-TCR interactions using an anti-CD3 antibody. Costimulatory signals, in the presence of isotype-matched control antibodies, were sufficient to promote time-of-day differences in OT-I CD8 + T cell proliferation;</p>
        <p>however, anti-CD80 treatment abrogated these time-of-day differences (Fig. 4i).</p>
        <p>Finally, antibody treatment against CD80 abrogated the differences in tumor volume after time-of-day dependent engraftment (Fig. 4j), demonstrating the functional relevance of CD80 in vivo in driving differences in tumor size. These data indicate that CD80 is a critical molecule in this process.</p>
        <p>In addition, we identified the presence of BMAL1-binding sites, namely canonical enhancer boxes (E-boxes), in the promoter region of the Cd80 gene. This suggests that Cd80 expression is directly regulated by the circadian clock (Extended Data Fig. 9e).</p>
        <p>Indeed, using ChIP assays, we confirmed rhythmic binding of BMAL1 to the Cd80 promoter (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 9f). Together, these data demonstrate that circadian rhythms in DCs direct the rhythms of T cell proliferation, a phenomenon dependent on the rhythmic expression of CD80, which is under direct transcriptional control of the clock gene BMAL1.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the translational potential of our findings, we explored tumor chronoimmunotherapy. Specifically, we studied mice inoculated with B16-F10-OVA melanoma cells at ZT9 and then immunized with OVA either during the day (ZT9) or at night (ZT21). This setting limited the time-of-day information to the timepoint of vaccination only. Strikingly, we found that tumor volume was strongly suppressed by the vaccine when administered to wild-type mice at ZT9 compared to ZT21 (Fig. 5a), even when the relative incubation time of the vaccine was significantly longer for ZT21 than for ZT9 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). In contrast, Bmal1 cDC mice vaccinated with OVA at ZT9 or ZT21 showed similar tumor sizes (Fig. 5b). Analysis of dLNs from</p>
        <p>wild-type mice 24h after vaccination revealed a higher number of SIINFEKLpresenting DCs in mice vaccinated at ZT9 compared to those vaccinated at ZT21</p>
        <p>(Figure 5c and Extended Data Fig. 10b). Furthermore, this increase at ZT9 coincided with higher numbers of CD69 + CD8 + and CD69 + CD4 + T cells (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 10c). In contrast, DC and T cell numbers and phenotypes remained similar in Bmal1 cDC mice vaccinated at ZT9 or ZT21 (Fig. 5c-d and Extended Data Fig. 10bc). These data indicate a key role of cDC rhythmicity in generating a productive antitumor immune response following treatment.</p>
        <p>We further performed vaccination experiments at ZT9 and ZT21 in a scenario which also tumors where inoculated at ZT9 and ZT21, thus assessing the contribution of time-of-day effects in both the timing of tumor inoculation and the timing of vaccination. In these experiments, we observed that the timing of vaccination had a greater impact than the timing of tumor inoculation on tumor burden (Extended Data Fig. 10d). Also, we confirmed the time-of-day differences in vaccine efficacy in additional experiments in which two vaccinations were performed at ZT9 or ZT21 several days apart (Extended Data Fig. 10e). These data demonstrate that the timing of vaccination is a powerful means of reducing tumor size, and that rhythmicity of cDCs plays a critical role in this process.</p>
        <p>To bypass any endogenous DCs acting as potential APCs in this scenario, we performed vaccinations with s.c. injections of SIINFEKL peptide-loaded BMDCs during the day (ZT9) or at night (ZT21). These experiments showed very similar results</p>
        <p>to the antigen vaccination studies, with suppressed tumor volume after daytime administration of the BMDCs (Fig. 5e). To assess whether these observations could</p>
        <p>translate to humans, we generated human monocyte-derived DCs (hMoDCs) from CD14 + primary monocytes isolated from buffy coats from healthy donors and synchronized them in vitro. hMoDCs exhibited a circadian expression of CD80 as well as of the clock gene PER2 (Fig. 5f-g and Extended Data Fig. 10f), analogous to the results obtained in mice. Furthermore, co-culture experiments using synchronized hMoDCs together with na√Øve CD8 + T cells isolated from the same healthy donors and stimulated with anti-human CD3 antibody -thus limiting rhythmicity to co-stimulatory factors in DCs only -showed an increased T cell proliferation in hMoDC 36h after synchronization compared to the 24h time point (Fig. 5h).</p>
        <p>Moreover, by generating HLA-A2 + MoDCs, pulsed with Melan-A26-35(A27L) peptide (ELAGIGILTV; 'ELA') and co-cultured with HLA-A2/ELA-specific CD8 + T cell clones derived from malignant melanoma patients 20 , we observed time-of-day differences in the T cell proliferation capacity (Fig. 5i). This indicated that the rhythmic anti-tumor responses we observed in mice were also present in human cells. Indeed, using retrospective time-of-day analyses of a tumor vaccination trial including 10 HLA-A2 + patients with advanced malignant melanoma 20 , we observed time-of-day differences in vaccine administration to result in increased Melan-A-specific CD8 + T cells in patients' blood, when vaccinations were perfomed in the morning compared to the afternoon (Fig. 5j). Together, these data provide evidence for an unexpected role of time-of-day in tumor engraftment and in the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in mice and humans.</p>
        <p>In this study, we focused mostly on a mouse model of melanoma, while our additional data indicate that other cancer types are also affected by a rhythmic immune system; however, whether similar immune mechanisms are at play in other tumor</p>
        <p>models remains to be formally demonstrated. Furthermore, our initial patient data indicate the importance of considering the time of day for the administration of cancer immunotherapy. By extension, it is possible that the time of day for the administration of any other treatment that involves activation of the immune system may matter. Given the relative simplicity of controlling this timing parameter in the clinic, it seems important to conduct prospective clinical trials that include sufficient numbers of patients and that can test whether the timing of injection of a given treatment improves the anti-tumor response and the patient's clinical outcome.

LPS-matured BMDCs were loaded with 10nM OVA-peptide SIINFEKL for 15min at 37¬∞C. Then 1,000 BMDCs were co-cultured with 10,000 na√Øve CD8 T cells in 200Œºl complete medium (RPMI, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 ŒºM -mercaptoethanol, 1mM pyruvate sodium) in a 96well round bottom plate. Plates were incubated at 37¬∞C with 5% CO2 for 48h before analysis. For polyclonal proliferation assays, na√Øve CD8 T cells were collected from C57BL/6N mice and labelled as described above. A total of 1,000 LPS-matured</p>
        <p>BMDCs were co-cultured with 10,000 na√Øve CD8 + T cells in 200 l complete medium (RPMI, 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 ŒºM -mercaptoethanol, 1mM pyruvate sodium) supplemented with anti-mouse CD3</p>
        <p>antibody (1 g/mL, ThermoFisher, Cat.16-0032-82) to provide the TCR signal. Human MoDCs were synchronized using horse serum as described above. Before co-culture with T cells, hMoDCs were matured with LPS (200ng/mL) for 24h. To assess proliferation, HLA-A2 + MoDCs were used and loaded with Melan-A26-35(A27L) peptide (ELAGIGILTV ('ELA'), 10 g/mL)) 24h prior to co-culture. For na√Øve T cell proliferation assays, human CD8 + T cells were isolated from PBMCs (the same donor as hMoDC) using a CD8 + T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) then labelled with Cell Trace Violet (Invitrogen‚Ñ¢). 10,000 labelled T cells were co-cultured with 1,000 matured hMoDC, together with 5 g/mL anti-human CD3 antibody (Invitrogen‚Ñ¢, Catalog # 16-0037-81). Five days later, T cells were collected for flow cytometry analysis. For patients' T cell proliferation assays, antigen-specific CD8 + T cells were FACS sorted from PBMC of melanoma patients using PE-conjugated HLA-A2/ELA multimers. Multimer + cells were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and allogenic feeder cells in a medium containing 150 U/ml human recombinant IL-2 (hrIL-2), as previously described 20 . Then, single clones of T cells were used for co-culture with hMoDC in a ratio of 5:1. On day 5, cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis. In vitro cell treatment SIINFEKL-loaded, LPS-matured BMDCs were adjusted to a concentration of 1 x 10 6 cells/well and incubated with anti-mouse CD80 (50 g/mL, 16-10A1, BioXCell) or isotype control for 15 min at 37¬∞C. Then, proliferation assays were performed as described above.</p>
        <p>B16-F10-OVA cells were cultured as mentioned above, and labelled with CellTrace‚Ñ¢ Violet (Invitrogen). Cells were counted and resuspended into PBS, then an equal volume of cold Corning¬Æ Matrigel¬Æ was added and mixed thoroughly with tumor cells.</p>
        <p>One million cells in 50Œºl were injected s.c. into the right flank of the mouse. 4h later, matrigels were harvested directly into 4% PFA and stored at +4¬∞C for 4 hours. Matrigels were kept in 30% sucrose (Sigma) overnight at +4¬∞C after fixation, embedded into OCT</p>
        <p>blocks (CellPath) and kept at -80¬∞C. Matrigels were subsequently dissected and processed for cryosectioning with 50 Œºm serial cryosections being cut and processed for immunohistochemistry. Sections were postfixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at RT.</p>
        <p>To obtain dendritic cells (DCs), draining inguinal LNs were collected from mice 24h after tumor engraftment and harvested at 4 time points (ZT3, 9, 15, and 21; n = 5 mice for control, n = 3 mice for Clec9acre:Bmal1 flox and n = 3 mice for sham-injected mice).</p>
        <p>LNs were digested as previously described, and CD45 + CD11C + MHCII high cells were sorted using an Astrios sorter (Beckman). Flow cytometry sorted DCs were collected in RNAprotect Cell Reagent (cat. #76526, Qiagen). RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (cat. #74034, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p>RNA integrity and quantity were assessed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).</p>
        <p>cDNA libraries were constructed by the Genomic platform of the University of Geneva as follows: The SMART-Seq v4 kit from Clontech was used for the reverse transcription and cDNA amplification according to the manufacturer's specifications, starting with 1 ng of total RNA as input. 200 pg of cDNA were used for library preparation using the Nextera XT kit from Illumina. Library molarity and quality were assessed with the Qubit and Tapestation using a DNA High sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were pooled and loaded for clustering on 2 lanes of a Singleread Illumina Flow cell. Reads of 50 bases were generated using the TruSeq SBS chemistry on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer.</p>
        <p>Reads were aligned with

        <p>Gene expression was quantified with 
            <rs type="software">HTSeq</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">0.9.1</rs>. Differential expression analysis was performed with the

            <rs type="software">Bioconductor</rs>
            <rs type="software">edgeR</rs> package . The counts were normalized according to the library size and filtered. Genes having a count above 1 count per million reads in at least 5 samples were kept for subsequent analysis. Tests for differentially expressed genes were done with a GLM (general linear model) using a negative binomial distribution. The genes were considered as differentially expressed when the fold change (FC) was at least 2-fold with a 5% false discovery rate (FDR) PCA was used to extract the strongest recurring patterns in the dataset. Gene expression values were scaled to a standard deviation of one prior to PCA, such that all genes were on an equal scale. The first four PCA scores were used to detect outliers (flagged by their deviation from the mean). A threshold of three units of standard deviations was used. The Cosinor method was used to test the summarized temporal signal for rhythmicity. PC1 and PC2 were kept as they scored above 10% of the variance each (WT: PC1: 18.9%, PC2: 13.6%; Bmal1 cDC : PC1: 20.6%, PC2: 12.3%; PBS sham injection: PC1: 20.2%, PC2: 11.6%) suggesting that two main phases of oscillation exist in the data (Supplementary Information Tables 123). Each gene was tested for rhythmicity with a significance value of a P-value &lt; 0.05. Genes with significant rhythmicity were assigned to two sets, depending on their acrophase (the time in a periodic cycle where a temporal pattern is at its maximum value). Genes with a sincoef &gt; 0 corresponded to an acrophase between 0 and 12 h (PC1), while genes with a sincoef &lt; 0 corresponded to an acrophase between 12 and 24 h (PC2). Both oscillating gene lists were tested for pathway enrichment, using Over-Representation Analyses (ORA) in Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) and Reactome pathways, using
