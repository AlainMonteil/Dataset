        <p>Neural respiratory drive, i.e., the activity of respiratory centres controlling breathing, is an overlooked physiologic variable which affects the pathophysiology and the clinical outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Spontaneous breathing may offer multiple physiologic benefits in these patients, including decreased need for sedation, preserved diaphragm activity and improved cardiovascular function. However, excessive effort to breathe due to high respiratory drive may lead to patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI), even in the absence of mechanical ventilation. In the present review, we focus on the physiological and clinical implications of control of respiratory drive in ARDS patients. We summarize the main determinants of neural respiratory drive and the mechanisms involved in its potentiation, in health and ARDS. We also describe potential and pitfalls of the available bedside methods for drive assessment and explore classical and more "futuristic" interventions to control drive in ARDS patients.Neural respiratory drive, i.e., the activity of respiratory centres controlling breathing, is an overlooked physiologic variable which affects the pathophysiology and the clinical outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

        <p>Breathing is generated by the rhythmic discharge of groups of neurons located in the brainstem which produces a neural signal directed to respiratory muscles to generate inspiratory effort and tidal breathing [1,2]. In humans, the activity of the respiratory centres requires a tonic excitatory input that derives from two sources: a chemosensory or "automatic" input and a descending or "behavioural" input.Breathing is generated by the rhythmic discharge of groups of neurons located in the brainstem which produces a neural signal directed to respiratory muscles to generate inspiratory effort and tidal breathing [1,2].

        <p>The chemosensory input is a feedback reflex mediated by afferents from central and peripheral chemoreceptors aimed at minimizing fluctuations of the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) and pH and correcting hypoxemia. Central chemoreceptors, located in the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata, regulate the ventilatory response to stabilize CO 2 : an increase in PaCO 2 , by decreasing the pH of cerebrospinal fluid, leads to a linear increase in minute ventilation until steadystate is achieved after a few minutes [3]. The peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid bodies, stimulate breathing by modifying the sensitivity and threshold of the central chemoreceptors, specifically providing faster and more intense responses to modifications in PaCO 2 and pH and to hypoxemia [3][4][5].The chemosensory input is a feedback reflex mediated by afferents from central and peripheral chemoreceptors aimed at minimizing fluctuations of the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) and pH and correcting hypoxemia.

        <p>The descending input is a feed-forward pathway from cortical brain centres and is responsible for adaptive changes of breathing pattern during complex activities, such as physical exercise and mental tasks [6,7]. Both the chemosensory and the central input are active in awake healthy subjects [8,9]. Indeed, artificially induced hypocapnia (e.g., through mechanical ventilation) does not abolish respiratory drive [9]. In addition, the respiratory rhythm is modulated by signals from the limbic system, which alters the breathing pattern in response to cognitive and emotional factors, including pain and anxiety [10].The descending input is a feed-forward pathway from cortical brain centres and is responsible for adaptive changes of breathing pattern during complex activities, such as physical exercise and mental tasks [6,7].

        <p>In physiological studies, the response of the subject to raised PaCO 2 level is assessed by measuring the increase in minute ventilation. In this context, two curves exist: the "brain curve", that describes the minute ventilation requested by the neural respiratory drive for a given PaCO 2 ; and the "ventilation curve", that describes the actual minute ventilation of the subject for a given PaCO 2 . In health, the brain curve coincides with the ventilation curve. The levels of PaCO 2 and the corresponding minute ventilation show a linear correlation, the slope of which represents the "brain" respiratory drive [11]. The actual point of equilibrium will lie at the intersection between this neural drive and the metabolic hyperbola, which, instead, is the relationship between ventilation and the resultant PaCO 2 for a given level of metabolic CO 2 production and dead space [11,12] (Fig. 1a).In physiological studies, the response of the subject to raised PaCO 2 level is assessed by measuring the increase in minute ventilation.

        <p>The brain curve, the ventilation curve and the metabolic hyperbola are all potentially modified in ARDS: increased dead space and metabolic CO 2 production shift the metabolic hyperbola upward, meaning that PaCO 2 is higher than normal for a given minute ventilation [11]; the slopes and the position of the brain curve and the ventilation curve are altered in opposite directions (Fig. 1b).The brain curve, the ventilation curve and the metabolic hyperbola are all potentially modified in ARDS: increased dead space and metabolic CO 2 production shift the metabolic hyperbola upward, meaning that PaCO 2 is higher than normal for a given minute ventilation [11]; the slopes and the position of the brain curve and the ventilation curve are altered in opposite directions (Fig. 1b).</p>
        <p>In ARDS, pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema result in increased intra-pulmonary shunt and dead space, and decreased functional lung size due to alveolar collapse (the so-called "baby lung") [13]. Systemic Fig. 1 Metabolic hyperbola, brain and ventilation curves in health and ARDS. The metabolic hyperbola is the relationship between ventilation and the resultant PaCO 2 for a given level of metabolic CO 2 production and dead space. Increased dead space or CO 2 production will shift the hyperbola up. The ventilation curve describes the actual effect of changing PaCO 2 on resultant minute ventilation. ARDS can shift the ventilation curve to the right (lower minute ventilation despite higher PaCO 2 ) due to increased respiratory load and muscle weakness. Finally, the brain curve (also known as the "controller curve", "CO 2 sensitivity curve" or "ventilation gain curve") describes the minute ventilation theoretically requested by the neural respiratory drive for a given PaCO 2 . During ARDS, this is shifted to the left (higher minute ventilation despite lower PaCO 2 ) due to multiple concomitant pathologic conditions, including acidosis, inflammation and others. a In health, brain and ventilation curves overlap and the ventilation response (i.e., the change in minute ventilation induced by a change in PaCO 2 ) reflects the neural respiratory drive. The metabolic hyperbola is obtained assuming a dead space of 0.3 and a metabolic CO 2 production (VCO 2 ) of 200 ml/min. Brain and ventilation curves are overlapping and are calculated assuming at PaCO 2 of 39.5 mmHg, a ventilation of 6.5 l/min, linearly increasing to 30 l/min at a PaCO 2 of 49 mmHg. b In ARDS, the metabolic hyperbola is shifted upward due to increase of dead space (0.5) and VCO 2 (250 ml/min). The listed factors cause the brain and ventilation curves to be shifted in opposite directions and diverge. Please, note that a single ARDS patient will be characterized by both curves at the same time: the brain curve will correspond to the theoretical ventilation/PaCO 2 correlation desired by the neural respiratory drive, while the ventilation curve will be the actual ventilation/PaCO 2 correlation measured by spirometer and blood gas analysis. Brain and ventilation curves are calculated assuming a ventilation of 6.5 l/min at 28 mmHg PaCO 2 (increasing to 30 l/min at 33 mmHg PaCO 2 ) and a ventilation of 5 l/min at 40 mmHg PaCO 2 (increasing to inflammation is common and extra-pulmonary organ dysfunction frequently develops (Fig. 2).In ARDS, pulmonary interstitial and alveolar edema result in increased intra-pulmonary shunt and dead space, and decreased functional lung size due to alveolar collapse (the so-called "baby lung") [13].

        <p>Impairment of gas exchange leads to an increase in chemosensory input. Increase in PaCO 2 , promoted by high dead space, induces a linear increase in respiratory drive through both central and peripheral chemoreceptors [14,15]. On the other hand, the ventilatory response following severe hypoxemia typical of ARDS is not linear but hyperbolic [11]. Peripheral chemoreceptors, which are relatively insensitive at mild hypoxemia, increase the neural respiratory drive in response to more severe hypoxemia, mainly by enhancing the ventilatory response to CO 2 when the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) falls below 60-70 mmHg. This effect can be potentiated by concomitant hypercapnia. Metabolic acidosis, which frequently complicates ARDS because of shock or acute kidney injury, stimulates both peripheral and central chemoreceptors [16].Impairment of gas exchange leads to an increase in chemosensory input.

        <p>In addition, ARDS might be associated with alterations of neural respiratory drive induced by mechanisms specifically associated with lung inflammation and altered mechanics. In awake spontaneously breathing rats, ARDS induces an increase in respiratory rate occurring before impairment of gas exchange. Hypoxic ventilatory response is also exaggerated due to a sensitization of peripheral chemoreceptors [17]. Local and systemic inflammation are hallmarks of ARDS [18], and pulmonary C-fibers sensitive to inflammatory mediators (including histamine, bradykinin and prostaglandins) are consistently activated in lung edema [19] and experimental acute lung injury [20]. Vagal afferents from these lung chemoreceptors can modulate the breathing pattern through a central reflex pathway [21]. The consequence of vagal activation is an increase in respiratory rate with a decrease in tidal volume, i.e., rapid shallow breathing [22,23], possibly through vagally mediated release of cytokines in the brainstem [24].In addition, ARDS might be associated with alterations of neural respiratory drive induced by mechanisms specifically associated with lung inflammation and altered mechanics.

        <p>The lung also contains mechanoreceptors: slowly adapting receptors (SARs) are stretch receptors activated by lung inflation that inhibit central chemoreceptors in Fig. 2 Schematic representation of control of respiratory drive in ARDS. The figure shows the key triggers of respiratory drive and the anatomic targets where these triggers exert their effects. In the centre, the descending cascade from neural respiratory drive to breathing effort and lung stress is represented, together with the main factors that may cause a dissociation between drive and effort (i.e., muscle function) and between drive, effort and lung stress (i.e., neuromechanical coupling and respiratory mechanics) rats (for example during the Hering-Breuer reflex), terminating inspiration. Although the Hering-Breuer reflex might be inhibited by the behavioural control of breathing in awake humans [25], decreased inhibitory input from these mechanoreceptors in the atelectatic lung could promote a further increase in inspiratory effort in ARDS. Indeed, the activation of mechanoreceptors appears to decrease as ARDS develops [20], while it is increased by increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [26], probably through stabilized lung recruitment. This could be one of the mechanisms by which high PEEP decreases spontaneous respiratory effort in ARDS [27]. Stimulation of the respiratory centres through each of these mechanisms increases the slopeand shift to the left-of the brain curve. Decreases in lung and chest wall compliance increase the elastic load and can alter the neuro-mechanical coupling between effort and diaphragmatic excursion. The result is a decreased slope of the ventilation curve and an increase in PaCO 2 , which induces a stimulation of neural respiratory drive and a dissociation between brain and ventilation curves (Fig. 3).The lung also contains mechanoreceptors: slowly adapting receptors (SARs) are stretch receptors activated by lung inflation that inhibit central chemoreceptors in Fig. 2 Schematic representation of control of respiratory drive in ARDS.

        <p>Pain, anxiety and discomfort are common in ARDS patients and all can influence drive. Emotional responses may affect the brain curve independent of a patient's metabolic demands: anxiety and fear act through the forebrain, limbic and cortical structures and the hypothalamus, processing information from the external environment and directly stimulating spinal respiratory motor neurons [10,28]. Pain affects the respiratory drive through both behavioural responses and a direct reflex on medullary respiratory centres [28]. On the other hand, the use of sedatives might decrease the neural respiratory drive [29].Pain, anxiety and discomfort are common in ARDS patients and all can influence drive.

        <p>Poor patient-ventilator interaction is another determinant of drive in subjects with ARDS on mechanical ventilation. Dyssynchronies might increase the respiratory drive because they cause discomfort and increased respiratory load [30]. Mismatch between the timing and duration of mechanical inflation and the neural inspiratory time prevents effective unloading of the respiratory muscles during assisted ventilation. Moreover, air trapping, which may occur during protective ventilation in ARDS due to the high respiratory rate, could cause additional inspiratory load and delayed trigger, both of which can increase drive.Poor patient-ventilator interaction is another determinant of drive in subjects with ARDS on mechanical ventilation.

        <p>A fundamental difference between ARDS patients and healthy subjects is that ventilatory response may not (and usually does not) mirror the respiratory drive [11]. The alterations in neuromuscular function (muscle weakness) and respiratory mechanics (atelectasis and increased lung and chest wall elastance) generate a discrepancy between the activity of the respiratory centres Fig. 3 Potential dissociation between neural respiratory drive (P 0.1 ) and respiratory effort (P es ) under pathologic conditions. The figure shows simulated identical waveforms for airway pressure (P aw ) during supported breaths but with different simulated oesophageal pressure (P es ) waveforms. P 0.1 (i.e., the negative airway pressure generated by occlusion occurring during the first 0.1 s of an inspiration) reflects the intensity of neural respiratory drive. Oesophageal pressure swings (ΔP es ) allow quantification of respiratory effort. However, in patients with high chest wall elastance, ΔP es underestimates effort. In the presence of muscular weakness, high drive may be associated with "normal" or even low effort (right panel) and the resulting motor output. When the intensity of the signal from the brain to the muscles and to the lung is dampened by these alterations, the force of contraction of respiratory muscles and the changes in intrathoracic pressure, flow and volume underestimate the neural drive. Therefore, clinical surrogates of respiratory drive may be conveniently categorized according to their "distance" from the respiratory centres (Table 1). First, neural output (i.e., electrical activity of the diaphragm); second, breathing effort, assessed by changes in pressure induced by the respiratory muscles (i.e., swings in pleural pressure or P 0.1 ); and, third, ventilatory response, reflected by the tidal volume and respiratory rate (breathing pattern).A fundamental difference between ARDS patients and healthy subjects is that ventilatory response may not (and usually does not) mirror the respiratory drive [11].

        <p>The electrical activity of the crural diaphragm (EAdi) reflects the phrenic nerve activity and hence the neural output of the respiratory centres to the diaphragm, provided that neuromuscular transmission and muscle excitability are intact. Eadi may be recorded using an oesophageal catheter with multiple electrodes and it represents the "closest" surrogate of neural respiratory drive available in clinical practice [32]. Because of high interindividual variability, it is difficult to provide references for absolute values of EAdi [33]. However, trends in EAdi allow the tracking of changes in neural output in individual patients [34]. EAdi is also increased in the presence of low muscle strength [35] and the ratio of actual EAdi to maximum EAdi measured during an occlusion may provide an accurate estimate of the patient neural respiratory drive and effort to breathe [33]. The ratio between tidal volume (V t ) and EAdi represents the neuroventilatory efficiency of the diaphragm [36]: a low V t /EAdi ratio, either due to diaphragm dysfunction or to compromised respiratory mechanics, indicates dissociation between neural respiratory drive and ventilatory response. EAdi monitoring only assesses the activity of the diaphragm. However, recruitment of accessory inspiratory [37] and expiratory [38,39] muscles is a strong indicator of increased neural respiratory drive due to a mismatch between the respiratory load and the muscle capacity with decreased expiratory time. Surface electromyography of extra-diaphragmatic respiratory muscles could, therefore, integrate the EAdi for a complete assessment of neural respiratory drive [40].The electrical activity of the crural diaphragm (EAdi) reflects the phrenic nerve activity and hence the neural output of the respiratory centres to the diaphragm, provided that neuromuscular transmission and muscle excitability are intact.

        <p>Indices based on the pressure developed by the respiratory muscles, such as oesophageal pressure swings (ΔP es ) and respiratory muscle pressure (P mus ), allow reliable quantification of inspiratory effort determined by the neural respiratory drive [41]. Even though ΔP es at increasing PEEP levels did not correlate with changes in the electrical activity of the diaphragm in ARDS patients in one study [27], driving transpulmonary pressure during active inspiration largely depends on ΔP es in presence of high respiratory effort and could be quite difficult to predict when monitoring only the airway pressure [42]. The pressure generated by the respiratory muscles (P mus ) is computed as the difference between the static recoil pressure of the chest wall and ΔP es . P mus values higher than 10 cmH 2 O might indicate high effort [43]. The negative airway pressure generated by occlusion occurring during the first 0.1 s of an inspiration, known as P 0.1 , is commonly used as an index of respiratory drive [44]. In healthy subjects, P 0.1 varies between 0.5 and 1.5 cmH 2 O. P 0.1 values consistently above 3-4 cmH 2 O indicate high neural respiratory drive and high work of breathing [45,46]. P 0.1 depends on the integrity of neuromuscular transmission. However, as compared with other indices based on breathing effort, it is not affected by moderate reductions of respiratory muscle strength, therefore, representing a reliable index of respiratory drive even in patients with muscular weakness [47].Indices based on the pressure developed by the respiratory muscles, such as oesophageal pressure swings (ΔP es ) and respiratory muscle pressure (P mus ), allow reliable quantification of inspiratory effort determined by the neural respiratory drive [41].

        <p>Interpretation of the breathing pattern as a surrogate for respiratory drive is challenging in ARDS patients. In healthy subjects, increases in ventilatory demand are met by initial increases in V t with constant inspiratory time (T i ), resulting in high mean inspiratory flow (V t /T i ), that reflects high drive [48][49][50]. Similarly, high V t (and high V t /T i ) in spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS suggest dangerous increases in respiratory drive both during noninvasive [51] and invasive mechanical ventilation [52]. Increased respiratory rate occurs only when respiratory drive is three to four times higher than normal and it is detected by an increased ratio of T i and total breath duration (T i /T tot ) [49,50]. However, decreased respiratory compliance [53] and muscular weakness may limit the increase in V t in ARDS [54]. Increased neural respiratory drive could then lead to early increases in respiratory rate with decreased T i [55] and the rapid shallow breathing index (respiratory rate divided by tidal volume) [56] might indicate high drive with unsatisfied ventilatory demand.Interpretation of the breathing pattern as a surrogate for respiratory drive is challenging in ARDS patients.

        <p>As a "gold standard" for clinical evaluation of respiratory drive is lacking, multilevel assessment might be the most informative approach. While measurements closer to the brain centres more reliably reflect the neural drive, downstream parameters (namely the amplitude and the rate of changes in lung volume and pressure that result in ventilation) provide information about the magnitude of lung stress generated by spontaneous ventilation, which is the determinant of P-SILI [58]. Dyspnea results from the imbalance between load and muscle capacity or from the imbalance between motor output and lung expansion [59]. The complex neural network involved in dyspnea receives afferent information on the respiratory motor output from the brainstem and the motor cortex [60], as well as multiple sensory feedbacks from the chemoreceptors and the mechanoreceptors of the lung and chest wall [61]. The perception of dyspnea depends on the integration of this motor and sensory information, modulated by emotion [62]. Therefore, bedside assessment of dyspnea could allow estimation of the distance between brain and ventilation curves.As a "gold standard" for clinical evaluation of respiratory drive is lacking, multilevel assessment might be the most informative approach.

        <p>The mechanisms underlying additional lung injury due to elevated efforts are multiple and complementary. High transpulmonary pressure during inspiration and large tidal volumes determine an increase in lung stress and strain. Patient-ventilator asynchronies due to high inspiratory effort such as double triggering can also lead to high tidal volume [65]. Even in the presence of protective V t and pressure, regional injury can still occur because of increased local stress in dependent atelectatic lung regions due to the solid-like behaviour of the diseased lung. In addition, decrease of pleural pressure generated by diaphragmatic contraction is larger in the dependent lung regions drawing air from non-dependent regions before ventilator flow reaches the alveoli (i.e., occult pendelluft phenomenon) [66]. Distribution of tidal volume within the lungs is usually more homogenous during spontaneous breathing as compared to controlled ventilation, but too high effort can lead to ventilation heterogeneity with a larger portion of tidal volumes reaching dependent regions. The increased negative pleural pressure during forceful breathing effort also increases transmural vascular pressure, which promotes additional pulmonary oedema due to increased lung perfusion and lower alveolar pressure [67].The mechanisms underlying additional lung injury due to elevated efforts are multiple and complementary.

        <p>Ideally, control of respiratory drive in ARDS should reduce the dissociation between brain and ventilation curves [11]. High respiratory drive might be considered "appropriate" when the activating stimulus can be corrected by increased ventilatory response. This is the case for hypercapnia and hypoxemia. Increased ventilation is the physiologic response aimed at correcting these alterations. Conversely, several stimuli that increase the activity of respiratory centres in ARDS are not modified by the ventilation feedback. For example, inflammation, pain and anxiety induce an "inappropriate" high respiratory drive. In the case of an appropriate high neural respiratory drive, the treatment should facilitate the ventilatory response (for example by increasing ventilatory support); on the other hand, inappropriate high drive requires a specific treatment (for example medications for anxiolysis). In the context of ARDS, the effects on the lung should always be monitored and high respiratory drive, either appropriate or inappropriate, should be controlled if it results in the generation of excessive lung stress with consequent increased in the risk of P-SILI.Ideally, control of respiratory drive in ARDS should reduce the dissociation between brain and ventilation curves [11].

        <p>However, these effects may be mitigated by competing physiologic effects. CPAP can lead to CO 2 re-breathing and decreased efficiency of CO 2 clearance that could diminish the positive effects on respiratory drive. During NIV, patient intolerance or air leaks may result in intermittent mask removal and promote patient-ventilator dyssynchrony, which, in turn, could increase respiratory drive by discomfort and sleep disruption. Finally, NIV unloads the respiratory muscles by applying positive airway pressure during inspiration, which could lead to unchanged or even increased transpulmonary pressure and additional lung injury [77].However, these effects may be mitigated by competing physiologic effects.

        <p>When invasive mechanical ventilation is instituted, there is often an initial phase of deep sedation, which may decrease the respiratory drive and, occasionally, a period of neuromuscular blockade, which eliminates breathing effort.

Potential mechanisms of benefit include unloading of the respiratory muscles, improved mechanics and better oxygenation. Oppositely, the drive increases when the ventilator support is reduced. However, unprotective levels of ventilation should not be tolerated in order to comply with the patient respiratory drive during PSV: switching back to controlled ventilation might be safer when inspiratory plateau pressure is higher than 30 cmH 2 O, Vt greater than 6-8 ml/kg predicted body weight and high levels of FiO 2 (e.g., &gt; 80%) are needed [58].

        <p>Future development of control of respiratory drive in hypoxemic patients might be related to non-pharmacological interventions such as targeted music therapy and extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R). Previous studies have described possible feed forward interaction between music rhythm and the breathing pattern of healthy and ICU subjects: this generates the fascinating hypothesis that music could act as a modulator of respiratory drive [93], potentially able to override metabolic inputs by decreasing stress and anxiety and increasing comfort (i.e., decreasing the behavioural drive) [94].Future development of control of respiratory drive in hypoxemic patients might be related to non-pharmacological interventions such as targeted music therapy and extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R).

        <p>ECCO 2 R decreases the amount of CO 2 that must be eliminated through the lungs: this, rather than modifying the brain neural drive, will simply move the metabolic hyperbola downward, thus reducing the actual PaCO 2 and minute ventilation level. In the case of stable subjects recovering from ARDS, in whom the slope of brain drive is less steep and the metabolic hyperbola closer to healthy subjects, the decrease of VCO 2 through the natural lung by ECCO 2 R decreases ventilation to minimal levels [95]. In the most severe patients with extremely high respiratory drive and with the metabolic hyperbola significantly shifted upward, efficacy of ventilation reduction by ECCO 2 R should be more limited, as indicated by pilot data [96]. Moreover, to date, the burden of ECCO 2 R-related complications is too high to consider the control of respiratory drive an indication for its use, in non-intubated patients with less severe ARDS. As ECCO 2 R systems become safer with advances in the technology, and the risk-to-benefit ratio improves, ECCO 2 R might become a more attractive method of controlling respiratory drive and avoiding further lung injury in patients with ARDS.ECCO 2 R decreases the amount of CO 2 that must be eliminated through the lungs: this, rather than modifying the brain neural drive, will simply move the metabolic hyperbola downward, thus reducing the actual PaCO 2 and minute ventilation level. In the case of stable subjects recovering from ARDS, in whom the slope of brain drive is less steep and the metabolic hyperbola closer to healthy subjects, the decrease of VCO 2 through the natural lung by ECCO 2 R decreases ventilation to minimal levels [95]. In the most severe patients with extremely high respiratory drive and with the metabolic hyperbola significantly shifted upward, efficacy of ventilation reduction by ECCO 2 R should be more limited, as indicated by pilot data [96].

        <p>Respiratory drive may represent a unique synthesis of complex pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying and accompanying ARDS. Higher drive not only may correlate with ARDS severity but, if not carefully managed, could contribute to lung and diaphragm injury. Thus, monitoring of the respiratory drive and interventions able to confine its effects within physiologic limits should be top priorities for the ICU physician caring for subjects with ARDS.Respiratory drive may represent a unique synthesis of complex pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying and accompanying ARDS.
