        <p>The sensation of groove, defined as the pleasurable desire to move to music (Janata et al., 2012), is one of the most powerful sources of music-derived pleasure. One way in which music is thought to elicit pleasure is through the interplay between the violation and fulfillment of musical expectations (Cheung et al., 2019;Huron, 2006;Juslin and V€ astfj€ all, 2008;Meyer, 1956;Salimpoor et al., 2015). Musicians and composers can manipulate the expectations of a listener by altering the complexity or predictability of the rhythms, melodies, harmonies, or other factors that make up a piece of music. For example, listeners prefer melodies that are moderately complex (i.e., moderately unpredictable) compared to very simple or very complex melodies (Pearce and Wiggins, 2012). Similarly, groove is thought to rely predominantly on rhythmic expectations, with moderately complex rhythms leading to greater pleasure and wanting to move (Matthews et al., 2019;Sioros et al., 2014;Witek et al., 2014).The sensation of groove, defined as the pleasurable desire to move to music (Janata et al., 2012), is one of the most powerful sources of music-derived pleasure.

        <p>Rhythmic expectations are closely tied to the metre, which is the pattern of alternating strong and weak beats (London, 2012;Vuust and Witek, 2014). For example, in a waltz metre which consists of a strong beat followed by two weak beats, listeners will expect a note to fall on the strong beat. When notes fall between beats, or on weak beats rather than strong beats, they create syncopations which violate expectations and challenge the metre (Fitch and Rosenfeld, 2007;Vuust and Witek, 2014). Very simple rhythms with no syncopations are highly predictable, but boring, as most, if not all rhythmic expectations are confirmed. Highly complex rhythms, with many syncopations, are unpredictable and hard to follow as it is difficult for the listener to perceive a metre, and thus generate rhythmic expectations. Medium complexity rhythms, with some syncopations, strike a balance allowing for both the formation and violation of rhythmic expectations. As the metre is challenged by syncopations, rhythmic expectations need to be assessed and updated. It has been proposed that this continuous engagement of rhythm expectation processes drives the pleasure associated with groove (Koelsch et al., 2019;Vuust et al., 2018;Vuust and Witek, 2014). One way of assessing rhythmic expectations is through movement (Patel and Iversen, 2014), which may account for the desire to move associated with groove (Koelsch et al., 2019).Rhythmic expectations are closely tied to the metre, which is the pattern of alternating strong and weak beats (London, 2012;Vuust and Witek, 2014).

        <p>The link between rhythmic expectations and wanting to move suggests that motor regions of the brain may be involved in processing groove-based music such as funk, Afro-Cuban, and hip-hop (Danielsen, 2006;Greenwald, 2002). There have been no previous neuroimaging studies investigating the brain regions involved in the sensation of groove. However, studies of beat perception show activity in brain networks associated with auditory-motor integration and motor timing (Araneda et al., 2016;Bengtsson et al., 2009;Burunat et al., 2017;Chapin et al., 2010b;Chen et al., 2008;Grahn and Brett, 2007;Grahn andRowe, 2013, 2009;Kung et al., 2013;Schubotz et al., 2000;Thaut et al., 2014). The basal ganglia (BG) seem to be particularly important for beat perception as they are crucial nodes in a core timing network proposed to underlie beat-based timing (Matell and Meck, 2004;Merchant et al., 2015;Teki et al., 2011). The BG also form distinct cortico-striatal circuits that may support different motor and motivational functions relevant to groove (Alexander et al., 1986;Haber, 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated that the putamen and supplementary motor area (SMA), which are parts of the cortico-striatal 'motor circuit', show selective responses to beat and metre (Araneda et al., 2016;Li et al., 2019). The caudate forms circuits with both prefrontal and parietal regions (Jarbo and Verstynen, 2015) and has been implicated in both rhythmic (Trost et al., 2014) and harmonic expectations (Seger et al., 2013).The link between rhythmic expectations and wanting to move suggests that motor regions of the brain may be involved in processing groove-based music such as funk, Afro-Cuban, and hip-hop (Danielsen, 2006;Greenwald, 2002).

        <p>Premotor, prefrontal, and parietal regions are also often activated in response to a strong beat (Bengtsson et al., 2009;Danielsen et al., 2014;Grahn and Schuit, 2012;Grahn et al., 2011;Grahn and McAuley, 2009;Grahn and Rowe, 2009;McAuley et al., 2012;Schubotz et al., 2000;Schubotz and von Cramon, 2001). These regions are part of the dorsal auditory stream (Hickok and Poeppel, 2004;Rauschecker, 2011), while premotor and parietal regions together form the dorsal fronto-parietal network (Ptak et al., 2017). These networks are believed to underlie abstract motor representations that allow for integration of sensory information over time (Ptak et al., 2017;Rauschecker, 2011). Furthermore, rhythmic expectations can be thought of as temporal predictions which are thought to originate in the motor and premotor cortices (Morillon and Baillet, 2017;Rimmele et al., 2018) and may reflect covert action simulation (Arnal, 2012;Patel and Iversen, 2014;Ross et al., 2016;Schubotz, 2007). Therefore, groove may activate motor regions of the brain via both the motor processes underlying rhythmic expectations and the overt or covert movement preparation purportedly involved in testing these expectations. Consistent with this, motor cortical excitability has been found to be greater for high compared to low groove music (Stupacher et al., 2013).Premotor, prefrontal, and parietal regions are also often activated in response to a strong beat (Bengtsson et al., 2009;Danielsen et al., 2014;Grahn and Schuit, 2012;Grahn et al., 2011;Grahn and McAuley, 2009;Grahn and Rowe, 2009;McAuley et al., 2012;Schubotz et al., 2000;Schubotz and von Cramon, 2001).

        <p>In addition to their role in beat-based timing, the BG, particularly the caudate and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), are associated with the anticipation and experience of music-derived pleasure (Blood et al., 1999;Blood and Zatorre, 2001;Koelsch, 2014;Salimpoor et al., 2013Salimpoor et al., , 2011)). Activity in the NAcc has been associated with the experience of pleasure including from primary (e.g., food and sex) and secondary (e.g., money) rewards (Sescousse et al., 2013). During music-listening, the NAcc is active during moments of peak pleasure, while the caudate is active in the period just before peak pleasure, suggesting that the caudate is involved in the anticipation of pleasure (Salimpoor et al., 2011). The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) also plays a role in assigning, maintaining and monitoring the value of a stimulus (Kringelbach, 2005;O'Doherty, 2004), including music (Koelsch, 2014). A network formed by the NAcc, mOFC, and auditory cortex has been linked to the enjoyment of music as shown by both structural (Martinez-Molina et al., 2019) and functional (Salimpoor et al., 2013) connectivity measures.In addition to their role in beat-based timing, the BG, particularly the caudate and nucleus accumbens (NAcc), are associated with the anticipation and experience of music-derived pleasure (Blood et al., 1999;Blood and Zatorre, 2001;Koelsch, 2014;Salimpoor et al., 2013Salimpoor et al., , 2011)).

        <p>Taken together, the sensation of groove can be framed as the intersection of reward processing and the motor processes that underlie beat perception, with rhythmic expectations as the driving mechanism. Therefore, to test the role of both reward and motor networks in the experience of groove, we asked participants to listen to rhythms with medium and high levels of complexity (i.e., degree of syncopation), and rate both their desire to move and pleasure while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Stimuli were drawn from a previous behavioural study showing that medium complexity rhythms were rated as more pleasurable and elicited a greater desire to move compared to low and high complexity rhythms (Matthews et al., 2019). Because we also found that harmonic complexity modulated the affective component of groove, this factor was included here. Finally, we tested both musicians and non-musicians based on evidence that training can affect both the sensation of groove (Matthews et al., 2019;Senn et al., 2018) and neural processing in both auditory-motor (Alluri et al., 2017;Grahn and Brett, 2007;Grahn and Rowe, 2009) and reward networks (Alluri et al., 2015;Chapin et al., 2010a).Taken together, the sensation of groove can be framed as the intersection of reward processing and the motor processes that underlie beat perception, with rhythmic expectations as the driving mechanism.

        <p>Fifty-seven participants were recruited into two groups (musicians and non-musicians). Musicians had a minimum of eight years of training and were currently practicing. Non-musicians had less than one year of training and were not currently practicing. Informed consent was obtained, and the study was approved by the Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics. Participants received 200 DKK remuneration. Two non-musicians were excluded from the scanning session due to technical problems. Another non-musician was excluded as their ratings showed no variability.

        <p>The stimuli were a subset of those developed and validated in a previously reported online study (Matthews et al., 2019). The stimuli consisted of short musical sequences with two levels of both rhythmic and harmonic complexity. There were three rhythms and three chords for each level of complexity resulting in 36 unique stimuli of four different categories: medium rhythm/medium harmony (Mr-Mh), medium rhythm/high harmony (Mr-Hh), high rhythm/medium harmony (Hr-Mh), and high rhythm/high harmony (Hr-Hh). These levels of complexity were chosen since, in the previous study, medium levels of rhythmic and harmonic complexity elicited the highest ratings and showed the greatest difference in ratings compared to high complexity rhythms and chords. In addition, two rather than three levels of complexity were chosen in order to maximize the number of trials for each level. The stimuli were created using

        </p>
        <p>The sequences consisted of piano chords organized into rhythmic chord patterns in a piano timbre presented at 96 beats per minute. Each sequence was 10 s long and contained four repeats of a five-onset rhythm pattern with a single chord repeating throughout each sequence plus an isochronous eighth-note hi-hat pattern (see Fig. 1 for musical notation of a medium complexity rhythm and SFig. 1 for a schematized representation of all rhythm patterns). The medium complexity rhythms consisted of two Afro-Cuban rhythms known as the son clave and rumba clave, and one experimenter-created rhythm. The high complexity rhythms had all but the first onsets shifted to be early or late relative to the medium complexity patterns, thus increasing their rhythmic complexity. Rhythmic complexity was quantified using the syncopation index (Fitch and Rosenfeld, 2007). As the hi-hat pattern was identical for all stimuli, it was not included when calculating the syncopation index. C-scoresa measure of counter-evidence to the metre - (Povel and Essens, 1985) were also calculated for each rhythm and were consistent with the syncopation index within each level of complexity (see SFig. 2A and 2B). All chords were in the key of D major and included six notes spanning four octaves (D2 to D#5; see Fig. 1 for musical notation of a medium complexity chord and Table S1 for a list of notes and corresponding frequencies for all chords). In musical terms, the medium complexity chords consisted of four-note chords with extensions. High complexity chords included a flat ninth interval between chord note and extension which is considered highly dissonant, when not specifically occurring as a flat 9th on a major 7th chord, according to contemporary harmonic theory (Freeman and Pease, 1989;Levine, 2011;Nettles and Ulanowsky, 1987). In lay terms, the high complexity chords contained notes with frequencies, or multiples of frequencies, that were very close to each other, thus creating an unpleasant sense of roughness or dissonance, while the medium complexity chords did not. Harmonic complexity was quantified using measures of peak roughness and inharmonicity, calculated using the

        <p>Before arriving for the study, participants filled out a questionnaire about their musical background and demographic information. Upon arrival, participants were familiarized with the stimuli and rating task with four familiarization trials using stimuli that were not included in the main study. There were two sessions during which participants listened to and rated all 36 stimuli, one inside the fMRI scanner and one outside the scanner. In order to avoid having ratings of wanting to move and pleasure influence each other, participants rated wanting to move in the scanner then pleasure and beat strength outside of the scanner, always in this order. Ratings of beat strength were collected in order to substantiate the rhythmic complexity manipulation and to investigate the association between the sensation of groove and perception of beat strength. In the scanning session, participants underwent three fMRI runs, each lasting around 11 min, during which they listened to all 36 stimuli in a pseudorandom order. A randomly selected subset of 12 stimuli were rated in each scanning run so that all 36 stimuli were rated over the three runs. Rating trials were randomly distributed within each run and participants were not aware that a given sequence would be rated until after it was presented, thus avoiding rating-specific activations. Participants selected their rating on a five-point visual scale by pressing two buttons on a button box to move a cursor right or left along the rating scale. Participants had 7 s to make their rating and non-rated trials had inter-stimulus intervals of five, 7.5, or 10 s. Participants were instructed to look at a fixation cross while sequences were presented.Before arriving for the study, participants filled out a questionnaire about their musical background and demographic information.

        <p>In order to reduce the effect of scanner noise, stimuli were presented with noise reduction headphones (Opto-Active, OptoAcoustics, Mazor, Israel, http://www.optoacoustics.com/me dical/optoactive/features). In addition, participants wore earplugs inside the headphones. In order to compensate for the low-pass filter effect of the earplugs, the stimuli were compared with and without earplugs and then altered so that they subjectively matched. This resulted in a 10-20 dB increase for frequencies greater than 1500 Hz. This adjustment was identical for all stimuli and participants.In order to reduce the effect of scanner noise, stimuli were presented with noise reduction headphones (Opto-Active, OptoAcoustics, Mazor, Israel, http://www.optoacoustics.com/me dical/optoactive/features).

        <p>Correlations between rating types were tested on participants' averaged ratings (one value per participant). Confidence intervals around correlation coefficients were calculated via bootstrapping with 5000 iterations. Analysis of the effects of rhythmic and harmonic complexity and group on ratings of pleasure, wanting to move, and beat strength were conducted on trial-level ratings using linear mixed effects regression with the 
            <rs type="software">lme4</rs> package (Bates et al., 2014) in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (version 
            <rs type="version">3.4.1</rs>, 
            <rs type="creator">R core team</rs>, 2017). A linear mixed effects approach was used to account for inter-individual differences in ratings and in the effects of rhythmic and harmonic complexity as well as differences in effects across the three rhythms and chords (referred to as items) within each level of complexity. Starting with the maximal random structure, including by-participant and by-item random slopes and intercepts, this structure was then reduced to the optimal structure that could be supported by the data following the steps of Bates et al. (2015) and using their 
            <rs type="software">RePsych-Ling</rs> package. This led to by-participant random slopes and intercepts for rhythmic and harmonic complexity in all three models and by-item random intercepts for the models with wanting to move and beat ratings as outcome variables.

        <p>For the effects of interest, a forward hierarchical approach was used whereby regressors were added incrementally to an intercept-only model, then tested for increases in fit using the likelihood ratio test. Regressors that significantly contributed to model fit were included in a final model (fit with restricted maximum likelihood criterion) which was used to get parameter estimates of these regressors. For interactions, estimates of means and mean differences were calculated using emmeans (Lenth et al., 2018). Confidence intervals around the parameter estimates were calculated via parametric bootstrapping with 5000 iterations. Diagnostic plots of the residuals from all models were inspected for violations of the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. No violations were detected.For the effects of interest, a forward hierarchical approach was used whereby regressors were added incrementally to an intercept-only model, then tested for increases in fit using the likelihood ratio test.

        <p>Scanning took place at Aarhus University Hospital on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio scanner with a 32-channel coil. Each participant underwent three runs of whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) using a multi-echo sequence which involved acquiring two whole brain volumes at two different echo times (TE1 ¼ 12.4 ms, TE2 ¼ 27.92 ms) per repetition time (TR ¼ 2000 ms and voxel size ¼ 2.35 Â 2.53 Â 2.50 mm, number of slices ¼ 54, flip angle ¼ 78 ). Using the multi-echo sequence reduces signal drop out in regions near sinuses such as the orbitofrontal cortex. The two EPI images within each TR were combined using a signal-tonoise ratio weighted average. This resulted in 326 images per run, with a total of 978 images per participant. T1 structural images were collected for each participant at the start of each session (TR ¼ 2420 ms, TE ¼ 3.7 ms, voxel size ¼ 1 mm iso, flip angle ¼ 9 ).Scanning took place at Aarhus University Hospital on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio scanner with a 32-channel coil. Each participant underwent three runs of whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) using a multi-echo sequence which involved acquiring two whole brain volumes at two different echo times (TE1 ¼ 12.4 ms, TE2 ¼ 27.92 ms) per repetition time (TR ¼ 2000 ms and voxel size ¼ 2.35 Â 2.53 Â 2.50 mm, number of slices ¼ 54, flip angle ¼ 78 ). Using the multi-echo sequence reduces signal drop out in regions near sinuses such as the orbitofrontal cortex.

        <p>First-level analysis used the general linear model with four condition regressors corresponding to the four types of stimuli (Mr-Mh, Mr-Hh, Hr-Mh, Hr-Hh) as well as twenty-four regressors accounting for motion parameters, and an additional regressor accounting for rating responses which were modeled as events time-locked to button presses. Silent interstimulus intervals were unmodeled, thus acting as an implicit baseline. All regressors were then convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function. Four contrast images were calculated per participant, corresponding to the four stimuli conditions. These were then entered into a second level analysis where group-level contrasts for each main effect and interaction were generated. All results are reported at a false discovery rate (FDR; peak-level) corrected p &lt; .05. In a mixed design, SPM uses the same error term and degrees of freedom for main effects of both within and between-subject factors (Chen et al., 2014;McLaren et al., 2011). Therefore, a confirmatory analysis was implemented in

        <p>Parameter estimates (betas) for each participant, for each condition were extracted from the putamen and caudate (left and right combined) as well as the left and right nucleus accumbens using

            <rs type="url">http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/)</rs> with anatomical masks from a probabilistic atlas (Hammers et al., 2003). Effects of rhythmic and harmonic complexity and musical training were then assessed using the same approach as the analysis of the ratings. Only by-participant random effects were included since parameter estimates were extracted from group level contrast images which did not contain item (i.e., trial) level activations.

        <p>An additional analysis was implemented to investigate the relation between subjective ratings and ROI activity. This analysis also used hierarchical linear mixed effects regression, with parameter estimates from the ROIs as outcome measures, and group, beat strength ratings, pleasure ratings, and wanting to move ratings, as well as interactions between group and the three types of ratings, as predictors. As in the above analysis, only by-participant random effects were included. In order to assess the degree of overlap in variance accounted for by pleasure and wanting to move ratings, and whether they accounted for variance over and above beat strength ratings and group differences, the hierarchical regression was implemented with two different orders: 1. Group, beat strength ratings, pleasure ratings, and wanting to move ratings, and 2. Group, beat strength ratings, wanting to move ratings, and pleasure ratings. The interactions between group and the ratings were entered after the main effects and followed the same orders. In addition to the final models including only the significant predictors from each hierarchical analysis, models with only pleasure ratings, only wanting to move ratings, and both together as predictors, were assessed.An additional analysis was implemented to investigate the relation between subjective ratings and ROI activity.

        <p>All three types of ratings were strongly correlated yet independent enough to be analyzed separately: Pleasure and wanting to move ratings (r ¼ 0.62, 95% CI[0.36, 0.81]); pleasure and beat strength ratings (r ¼ 0.55, 95% CI[0.27, 0.77]); Wanting to move and beat strength ratings (r ¼ 0.42, 95% CI[0.19, 0.61]).All three types of ratings were strongly correlated yet independent enough to be analyzed separately: Pleasure and wanting to move ratings (r ¼ 0.62, 95% CI[0.36, 0.81]); pleasure and beat strength ratings (r ¼ 0.55, 95% CI[0.27, 0.77]); Wanting to move and beat strength ratings (r ¼ 0.42, 95% CI[0.19, 0.61]).</p>
        <p>For both musicians and non-musicians, pleasure ratings decreased as rhythmic and harmonic complexity increased (Fig. 2A). However, a significant interaction between rhythmic and harmonic complexity (χ 2 (1) ¼ 8.98, p &lt; .003) showed that the difference in ratings between Mr-Mh and Mr-Hh (mean difference (MD) ¼ 0.696) was greater than the difference between Hr-Mh and Hr-Hh (MD ¼ 0.440; b ¼ 0.250, 95% CI [0.090, 0.409]). This suggests that medium complexity chords increased pleasure to a greater degree when combined with medium complexity rhythms compared to high complexity rhythms. The rhythm by group interaction improved model fit (χ 2 (1) ¼ 4.69, p ¼ .030) and showed that the difference in ratings between medium and high complexity was greater for non-musicians (MD ¼ 1.53) than musicians (MD ¼ 1.17; b ¼ À0.364, 95% CI[-0.679, À0.035]).For both musicians and non-musicians, pleasure ratings decreased as rhythmic and harmonic complexity increased (Fig. 2A).

        <p>For wanting to move ratings, there was a three-way interaction with rhythm, harmony, and group (χ 2 (1) ¼ 5.84, p ¼ .016; Fig. 2B).

        <p>For beat strength, the main effect of rhythmic complexity significantly improved model fit (χ 2 (1) ¼ 74.83, p &lt; .001), with medium complexity rhythms rated as having a stronger beat than high complexity rhythms (b ¼ 1.672, 95% CI[1.408,1.933]). The rhythm by harmony interaction also improved model fit (χ 2 (1) ¼ 4.08, p ¼ .043) showing that Hr-Mh were rated as having higher beat strength than Hr-Hh (MD ¼ 0.207), whereas Mr-Mh and Mr-Hh were rated more similarly (MD ¼ 0.077; b ¼ À0.130, 95% CI[-0.254, 0.002]; Fig. 2C). This suggests that high complexity rhythms combined with medium complexity chords are rated as having higher beat strength than high complexity rhythms with high complexity chords.

        <p>Whole-brain contrast images were used to assess the effects of rhythm, harmony, and musical training (group). Contrasting medium versus high complexity rhythms (medium &gt; high complexity) revealed activations in the bilateral BG including the putamen, caudate, and pallidum, with activation in the left BG bordering the NAcc. This contrast also revealed activation in a network of cortical regions associated with beat perception including the left SMA (including pre-SMA), bilateral dorsal premotor regions, and bilateral parietal regions (see Table 2 and Fig. 3). In addition, this contrast revealed significant activation in the left prefrontal cortex, left mOFC, the bilateral inferior temporal cortex, and crus 1 in the right cerebellum. The opposite contrast (high &gt; medium complexity rhythms) revealed no significant activations. Contrasting musicians versus non-musicians (musicians &gt; non-musicians; averaging over all stimuli conditions) revealed activations in the bilateral caudate, bilateral motor cortex (extending into dorsal premotor cortices), bilateral SMA, right prefrontal cortex, right Heschl's gyrus, and left posterior superior temporal gyrus (see Table 3 and Fig. 4).

        <p>In this study we set out to understand the brain networks involved in the sensation of groove. Consistent with previous findings, participants experienced a stronger sensation of groove for medium compared to high levels of both rhythmic and harmonic complexity, with higher ratings of pleasure and wanting to move (Matthews et al., 2019). This was coupled with greater activity for medium complexity rhythms in reward-related regions including the NAcc, caudate, and mOFC, and in regions associated with beat-based timing including the putamen, SMA, as well as prefrontal and parietal cortices. In addition, in both the left and right NAcc, pleasure and wanting to move ratings predicted activity to a similar degree, largely accounting for the same variance.

        <p>Together, these findings suggest that the sensation of groove is driven by a combination of motor and reward regions in the brain.

        <p>Behavioural results showed that medium complexity rhythms led to higher ratings of pleasure, wanting to move, and beat strength. Only the medium and high complexity conditions were included in order to maximize the number of trials per condition. Therefore, we could not confirm an inverted U-shaped pattern of ratings here. However, ratings for the medium and high complexity rhythms are consistent with those obtained in our previous study which included the low complexity condition (Matthews et al., 2019). Therefore, the current results provide further evidence that medium complexity rhythms strongly contribute to the sensation of groove.Behavioural results showed that medium complexity rhythms led to higher ratings of pleasure, wanting to move, and beat strength.

        <p>Consistent with previous results, medium complexity chords in combination with medium complexity rhythms increased pleasure ratings, providing further evidence that harmony enhances the affective component of groove (Matthews et al., 2019). Intriguingly, ratings of beat strength were also enhanced by medium complexity chords, supporting previous work showing that beat and metre perception are not driven by rhythmic factors alone (Dawe et al., 1993;Hannon et al., 2004). Finally, for musicians, the combination of medium complexity rhythms and chords enhanced the desire to move, suggesting that for those with musical training, the sensation of groove is more affected by non-rhythmic factors.Consistent with previous results, medium complexity chords in combination with medium complexity rhythms increased pleasure ratings, providing further evidence that harmony enhances the affective component of groove (Matthews et al., 2019).

        <p>fMRI results showed that medium complexity rhythms were associated with greater activity in the left NAcc and left mOFC. Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the NAcc and mOFC are important for the experience of music-derived pleasure (Koelsch, 2014;Martinez-Molina et al., 2019;Martínez-Molina et al., 2016;Salimpoor et al., 2013). Here, activity in both left and right NAcc also showed a positive association with both pleasure and wanting to move ratings, suggesting an association with groove overall rather than the pleasure component alone. One explanation may be that the NAcc is not only involved in the experience of music-derived pleasure, but also in the processing of expectations that can lead to such pleasure (Gebauer et al., 2012;Koelsch, 2014;Salimpoor et al., 2015). For example, NAcc activation has recently been associated with musical uncertainty (Cheung et al., 2019) and musical surprise (Shany et al., 2019), and has also been shown to track reward prediction errors associated with harmonic violations (Gold et al., 2019). In the current study, the right NAcc showed greater activation in response to the combination of medium complexity rhythms and chords, which was the condition that elicited the highest pleasure and wanting to move ratings. Interestingly, this was the only region to show an effect of harmonic complexity, which might relate to the right-dominance of regions involved in tonal processing (Zatorre et al., 2002).fMRI results showed that medium complexity rhythms were associated with greater activity in the left NAcc and left mOFC. Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the NAcc and mOFC are important for the experience of music-derived pleasure (Koelsch, 2014;Martinez-Molina et al., 2019;Martínez-Molina et al., 2016;Salimpoor et al., 2013). Here, activity in both left and right NAcc also showed a positive association with both pleasure and wanting to move ratings, suggesting an association with groove overall rather than the pleasure component alone. One explanation may be that the NAcc is not only involved in the experience of music-derived pleasure, but also in the processing of expectations that can lead to such pleasure (Gebauer et al., 2012;Koelsch, 2014;Salimpoor et al., 2015). For example, NAcc activation has recently been associated with musical uncertainty (Cheung et al., 2019) and musical surprise (Shany et al., 2019), and has also been shown to track reward prediction errors associated with harmonic violations (Gold et al., 2019).

        <p>Activity in the mOFC has been associated with assigning affective value to stimuli, including music (Zatorre and Salimpoor, 2013). However, in the current results mOFC activity showed a stronger association with wanting to move ratings than with pleasure ratings. A more recent hypothesis suggests that OFC involvement in value assignment is contingent on whether this process involves mental simulation of behavioural outcomes (Stalnaker et al., 2015). This is consistent with the current results as wanting to move ratings, in contrast to pleasure ratings, may involve action simulation. Therefore, one possibility is that the NAcc encodes the positive affective state of groove, while the mOFC encodes the association between the music and the desire to move.Activity in the mOFC has been associated with assigning affective value to stimuli, including music (Zatorre and Salimpoor, 2013).

        <p>Our results also showed greater activation in bilateral putamen and caudate as well as the SMA (including pre-SMA) and bilateral dorsal Fig. 5. Results of ROI analysis. A. Coronal view of a single subject MNI template showing BG masks from probabilistic anatomical atlas used in region of interest analyses (Hammers et al., 2003) premotor cortices for medium complexity rhythms. The putamen and the SMA are part of the cortico-striatal 'motor circuit' (Alexander et al., 1986) and together with the caudate are suggested to be crucial nodes in both the striatal beat-frequency and pacemaker-accumulator models of timing (Coull et al., 2011;Matell and Meck, 2004;Merchant et al., 2013). In addition, recent theories suggest that temporal predictions are generated in the motor system via covert and unconscious action simulation (Arnal, 2012;Patel and Iversen, 2014;Rimmele et al., 2018;Ross et al., 2016;Schubotz, 2007). This is supported by a recent study showing that temporal predictions in the context of regular auditory stimuli are driven by motor signals to the auditory cortex (Morillon and Baillet, 2017). In the context of beat perception, the efferent signals of these covert actions may act as an internal representation of the beat, or 'pacing signal' (Kotz et al., 2016), informing beat-based expectations.Our results also showed greater activation in bilateral putamen and caudate as well as the SMA (including pre-SMA) and bilateral dorsal Fig. 5.

        <p>Converging evidence suggest that the putamen, SMA and dorsal premotor cortices are crucial for generating an internal representation of a beat (Araneda et al., 2016;Grahn and Brett, 2007;Grahn and Rowe, 2009;Merchant et al., 2015), with the putamen seeming particularly important (Grahn and Rowe, 2013). Studies with both Parkinson's disease (Grahn and Brett, 2009) and lesion patients (Nozaradan et al., 2017) also support the importance of the BG in beat perception. Furthermore, oscillatory activity in the SMA and putamen has been shown to entrain to frequencies denoting the beat and metre, respectively (Li et al., 2019). However, two recent studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) support the role of the dorsal premotor cortex (Ross et al., 2018a) but not the SMA (Ross et al., 2018b) in beat perception.Converging evidence suggest that the putamen, SMA and dorsal premotor cortices are crucial for generating an internal representation of a beat (Araneda et al., 2016;Grahn and Brett, 2007;Grahn and Rowe, 2009;Merchant et al., 2015), with the putamen seeming particularly important (Grahn and Rowe, 2013).

        <p>Interestingly, the caudate was the only region of interest whose activity showed a main effect of beat strength ratings. However, further analysis revealed strong overlap between the effects of beat strength and wanting to move ratings in this region. Beat strength ratings did show a relation to putamen activity via an interaction with group, the nature of which also depended on the inclusion of wanting to move ratings in the model. Together these results provide further evidence that beat perception and motor activation are strongly linked, both in terms of subjective experience and neural underpinnings.Interestingly, the caudate was the only region of interest whose activity showed a main effect of beat strength ratings.

        <p>Medium complexity rhythms also elicited increased activation in bilateral parietal (with peaks in inferior and superior parietal lobules) and left prefrontal cortical regions. Parietal and prefrontal regions are components of both the dorsal auditory (Hickok and Poeppel, 2004;Rauschecker, 2011) and the fronto-parietal networks (Ptak et al., 2017), which are thought to underlie the motor representations of stimuli allowing for the processing of sensory input that evolves over time (Ptak et al., 2017;Rauschecker, 2011). These regions have also been implicated in the cognitive aspects of temporal and rhythmic processing including temporal attention (Bolger et al., 2014;Coull and Nobre, 2008;Coull et al., 2011;Davranche et al., 2011;Nobre and van Ede, 2017), encoding and retrieval of beat-based time intervals (Konoike et al., 2015(Konoike et al., , 2012)), and rhythmic deviant detection (Lappe et al., 2016(Lappe et al., , 2013)). A recent TMS study showed that down-regulating parietal activity disrupts perception of phase shifts of the beat (Ross et al., 2018b). These results are consistent with the parietal cortices purported role as the interface between motor-driven temporal predictions and sensory input (Rauschecker, 2011; Rimmele et al., 2018).Medium complexity rhythms also elicited increased activation in bilateral parietal (with peaks in inferior and superior parietal lobules) and left prefrontal cortical regions.

        <p>Prefrontal activity during beat perception has been linked to precision of sensory predictions (Bengtsson et al., 2009) and working memory (Kung et al., 2013), consistent with its role in beat-based timing (Teki et al., 2011). Therefore, the dorsal prefrontal activity seen here may represent the generation of beat-based expectations and monitoring of their outcome. The caudate is strongly connected to prefrontal and parietal regions (Haber, 2016), and both whole-brain and ROI analyses showed greater caudate activation for medium complexity rhythms. A recent study using TMS suggests that a left dorsolateral prefrontal-caudate circuit determines music liking and wanting by coding musical expectancies based on structural properties (Mas-herrero et al., 2018). In the current context, prefrontal and parietal regions, along with the caudate, may generate and update beat-based expectations and compare these expectations to incoming stimuli.Prefrontal activity during beat perception has been linked to precision of sensory predictions (Bengtsson et al., 2009) and working memory (Kung et al., 2013), consistent with its role in beat-based timing (Teki et al., 2011).

        <p>Although the overall pattern of activity was similar for both groups, musicians showed greater activity in the caudate, right prefrontal cortex, SMA, primary and premotor cortex and primary and secondary auditory regions, compared to non-musicians, regardless of rhythm complexity. Musicians have shown greater activity in the SMA and premotor cortex (Grahn and Brett, 2007) and greater connectivity between SMA and auditory regions (Grahn and Rowe, 2009) during rhythm perception tasks. Together, these results suggest that musical training leads to greater engagement of regions involved in beat perception as well as stronger auditory-motor associations (Alluri et al., 2017;Zatorre et al., 2007). This is in line with the current behavioural findings, as well as those from a previous study showing that musicians are more sensitive to rhythmic and harmonic manipulations (Matthews et al., 2019), and with results showing greater neural responses to rhythmic deviants (Geiser et al., 2010;Habibi et al., 2014;Vuust et al., 2009).Although the overall pattern of activity was similar for both groups, musicians showed greater activity in the caudate, right prefrontal cortex, SMA, primary and premotor cortex and primary and secondary auditory regions, compared to non-musicians, regardless of rhythm complexity.

        <p>We propose a theoretical model integrating the current results with previous work discussed above. According to this model, the putamen, along with the SMA and premotor cortices automatically generate an internal representation of the beat. These regions interact with the caudate, prefrontal, and parietal regions which use this beat representation to inform rhythmic expectations and compare them to incoming stimuli. These regions may also use this beat information to generate higher-level expectations regarding the way music will unfold over longer timescales (Salimpoor et al., 2015). Information from both the putamen and caudate networks may then be passed to the NAcc-mOFC circuit which generates a positive affective response, including both pleasure and the desire to move, and assigns value to both rhythmic and higher-level expectations. Medium complexity rhythms activate these networks as they are regular enough to allow for internal beat generation, but also contain syncopations that challenge this regularity and thus engage expectation processes leading to the pleasurable desire to move. In addition, the repetition of rhythmic patterns, used here in our stimuli and common in groove-based music (Danielsen, 2006), may engage processes involved in higher-level expectations. Furthermore, musical training may strengthen these expectations and the brain networks that support them. Finally, although rhythm appears to be the primary feature influencing groove, other factors, including harmony and familiarity also enhance pleasure (Matthews et al., 2019;Pereira et al., 2011;Senn et al., 2019;van den Bosch et al., 2013).

        <p>The current study sought to investigate the brain networks underlying the pleasurable desire to move to music, known as the sensation of groove. Medium complexity rhythms led to greater activity in brain regions associated with both motor timing and reward. Subjective ratings of pleasure and wanting to move were associated with activity in BG regions of interest supporting their crucial role, not only in processing rhythmic complexity, but also in the subjective experience of groove. These results provide novel evidence supporting the formulation of groove as the intersection of motor timing and reward processes. Based on this formulation, we propose a model in which different corticostriatal networks support the generation and affective valuation of beat-based expectations. Future studies will test the interactions between these networks, leading to a better understanding of how prediction and reward-based mechanisms work together.The current study sought to investigate the brain networks underlying the pleasurable desire to move to music, known as the sensation of groove.
