        <p>Results: Lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 and GFAP were observed in CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ+, and AD Aβ+, whereas elevated plasma NfL was observed in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+, compared with CU Aβ-and MCI Aβ-. Among the aforementioned plasma biomarkers, for models with and without AD risk factors (age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status), p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting a brain Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum. However, for models with and without the AD risk factors, a biomarker panel of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP performed equivalent to or better than any of the biomarkers alone in predicting brain Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum.Results: Lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 and GFAP were observed in CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ+, and AD Aβ+, whereas elevated plasma NfL was observed in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+, compared with CU Aβ-and MCI Aβ-.

        <p>Longitudinally, plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in MCI compared with CU, and plasma GFAP and NfL were altered in AD compared with CU. In addition, lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and higher p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were associated with prospective cognitive decline and lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and higher p-tau181 and GFAP were associated with increased Aβ-PET load prospectively.Longitudinally, plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in MCI compared with CU, and plasma GFAP and NfL were altered in AD compared with CU.

        <p>Discussion: These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered crosssectionally and longitudinally, along the AD continuum, and are prospectively associated with cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load. In addition, although p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting an Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum, a panel of biomarkers may have superior Aβ-/+ status predictive capability across the AD continuum.Discussion: These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered crosssectionally and longitudinally, along the AD continuum, and are prospectively associated with cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load.

        <p>Abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau buildup in the brain measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and Aβ42 and phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the current core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These biomarkers reflect AD neuropathology and begin to manifest two decades before the appearance of clinical symptoms. 1,2 However, the high cost, low throughput, and exposure to radiation associated with PET and the perceived invasiveness and expertise associated with lumbar puncture have all highlighted the need for surrogate markers in the blood.Abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau buildup in the brain measured with positron emission tomography (PET), and Aβ42 and phosphorylated-tau181 (p-tau181) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the current core biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

        <p>Plasma Aβ (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio), p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) are some of the putative blood-based biomarkers for AD. 3,4 Circulating levels of these biomarkers have been reported to reflect AD-related neuropathological processes such as impaired clearance of brain Aβ, disruption of the axonal cytoskeletal structure, and reactive astrogliosis. 3,[5][6][7][8][9] Previous studies have reported lower plasma Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio 5,10-14 and higher plasma p-tau181 and GFAP in preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and AD dementia. 5,6,12,[15][16][17] In addition, blood-based NfL levels have been observed to be higher in both prodromal AD and AD dementia. [18][19][20] However, head-to-head studies of the aforementioned plasma biomarkers across the AD continuum are lacking. Therefore, in the current study, we carried out a head-to-head comparison of plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL alterations between Aβ-PET-negative (Aβ-) and Aβ-PET-positive (Aβ+) individuals across the AD continuum and evaluated the Aβ-/+ status predictive performance of these biomarkers against each other before and after the addition of AD risk factors, as well as evaluated their Aβ-/+ predictive performance as a biomarker panel before and after the addition of AD risk factors. In addition, we investigated the longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers between the diagnostic groups over 36 months and investigated the association of plasma biomarkers at baseline with prospective cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load over a duration of 7 to 10 years.Plasma Aβ (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio), p-tau181, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) are some of the putative blood-based biomarkers for AD. 3,4 Circulating levels of these biomarkers have been reported to reflect AD-related neuropathological processes such as impaired clearance of brain Aβ, disruption of the axonal cytoskeletal structure, and reactive astrogliosis. 3,[5][6][7][8][9] Previous studies have reported lower plasma Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio 5,10-14 and higher plasma p-tau181 and GFAP in preclinical AD, prodromal AD, and AD dementia. 5,6,12,[15][16][17] In addition, blood-based NfL levels have been observed to be higher in both prodromal AD and AD dementia.

        <p>To date only a handful of studies have investigated longitudinal changes in the aforementioned plasma biomarkers in clinically classified MCI and AD. In the current study, we observed a longitudinal decrease in plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and a longitudinal increase in plasma p-tau181 in MCI participants compared with controls; however, no significant longitudinal changes were observed in plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and p-tau181 levels in AD participants compared with controls. These findings are consistent with previous CSF and plasma familial AD studies reporting that alterations in Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratios and p-tau181 levels along the disease trajectory ultimately begin to plateau following the first progressive symptom (e.g., memory, motor, or behavior) onset. 2,44 Furthermore, Rodriguez and colleagues show that the trajectory of p-tau181 is associated with the duration of AD status, wherein increases in plasma p-tau181 in AD patients were observed up to 8 to 4 years prior to death, which later plateaued. 45 Given that we do not have data on the duration of AD status for partic-ipants in the current study, further studies are required to investigate the trajectory of p-tau181 levels in AD participants from disease onset to death.

It is acknowledged that this study also has its limitations. Aβ+ defined classification was not used to assess longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers as only a modest Aβ-PET sample size with follow-up timepoints was available; however, analyses were adjusted for Aβ-/+ status at baseline. Preliminary, longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers in groups classified using both clinical and Aβ-/+ status are; however, presented in Table S10, albeit further validation studies are required. In addition, analyses could not include tau-PET-/+ status to assess early or late preclinical AD stages, given that these data were not available for the analyzed sample set. Furthermore, the measurement of Aβ42/Aβ40 using the Simoa platform has been reported to perform inferiorly to immunoprecipitation followed by mass-spectrometry methods or the Elecsys immunoassay with respect to its predictive performance for Aβ-/+ status. 42 To conclude, results from the current study suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered cross-sectionally and longitudinally, sequentially along the AD continuum, and are associated with prospective cognitive decline and increase in brain Aβ-PET load. These findings provide further evidence of the diagnostic and prognostic potential of plasma biomarkers. Findings from the current study haveBaseline plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, p-tau181, and GFAP were also observed to be associated with future brain Aβ accumulation, in line with previous reports. Schindler and colleagues reported a 15-fold greater risk of conversion to Aβ+ in Aβ-cognitively normal individuals with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio &lt; 0.1218 compared with individuals with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio &gt; 0.1218. 51 In addition, Shen and colleagues reported that individuals with abnormal baseline plasma p-tau181 levels had a higher risk of progression to pathological brain amyloid load. 52 Furthermore, Pareira and colleagues have reported that plasma GFAP levels predicted Aβ accumulation before and after adjusting for age, sex, baseline Aβ status, presence of cognitive impairment, and tau PET load. 31 The strengths of the current study include Aβ+ defined classification, the availability of serial plasma measurements to assess longitudinal changes in plasma biomarkers, and the availability of longitudinal data on cognition and brain Aβ-PET load.
