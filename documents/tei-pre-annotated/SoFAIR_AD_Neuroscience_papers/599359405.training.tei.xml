        <p>The extent to which sleep is causally related to mental health is unclear. One way to test the causal link is to evaluate the extent to which interventions that improve sleep quality also improve mental health. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that reported the effects of an intervention that improved sleep on composite mental health, as well as on seven specific mental health difficulties. 65 trials comprising 72 interventions and N ¼ 8608 participants were included. Improving sleep led to a significant medium-sized effect on composite mental health (gþ ¼ À0.53), depression (gþ ¼ À0.63), anxiety (gþ ¼ À0.51), and rumination (gþ ¼ À0.49), as well as significant small-to-medium sized effects on stress (gþ ¼ À0.42), and finally small significant effects on positive psychosis symptoms (gþ ¼ À0.26). We also found a dose response relationship, in that greater improvements in sleep quality led to greater improvements in mental health. Our findings suggest that sleep is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties. Future research might consider how interventions that improve sleep could be incorporated into mental health services, as well as the mechanisms of action that explain how sleep exerts an effect on mental health.The extent to which sleep is causally related to mental health is unclear.

        <p>Problems sleeping are common. A review of several hundred epidemiological studies [1] concluded that nearly one-third of the general population experience symptoms of insomnia (defined as difficulties falling asleep and/or staying asleep), between 4% and 26% experience excessive sleepiness, and between 2% and 4% experience obstructive sleep apnoea. Additionally, a recent study of over 2000 participants reported that the prevalence of 'general sleep disturbances' was 32% [2] and Chattu et al. concluded on the basis of a large systematic review of the evidence that public and health professionals need to be more aware of the adverse effects of poor sleep [3]. Mental health problems are also common, with around 17% of adults experiencing mental health difficulties of varying severities [4], and evidence from large nationally representative studies suggesting that mental health difficulties are on the increase [5]. Sleep and mental health are, therefore, global public health challenges in their own right, with each having substantive impacts on both individuals and society [3,6,7]. However, problems sleeping and mental health difficulties are also intrinsically linked [8,9]. It was previously assumed that mental health difficulties led to problems sleeping [10,11]; however, the reverse may also be true [12], such that poor sleep contributes to the onset, recurrence, and maintenance of mental health difficulties [13e17]. Therefore, the extent to which there is a causal relation between (poor) sleep and (worse) mental health and the possibility that interventions designed to improve sleep might be able to reduce mental health difficulties warrants investigation.Problems sleeping are common.

        <p>The association between sleep and mental health is well documented [9,13,18e23]. For example, people with insomnia are 10 and 17 times more likely than those without insomnia to experience clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety, respectively [24]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 21 longitudinal studies reported that people with insomnia at baseline had a twofold risk of developing depression at follow-up compared with people who did not experience insomnia [13]. Although research most commonly studies the associations between insomnia and depression and anxiety, there is also evidence that problems sleeping are associated with a variety of mental health difficulties. For example, poor sleep has also been associated with posttraumatic stress [25], eating disorders [26], and psychosis spectrum experiences such as delusions and hallucinations [23,27]. Studies have also found that specific sleep disorders, such as sleep apnoea [28], circadian rhythm disruption [29], restless leg syndrome [30], excessive daytime sleepiness and narcolepsy [31,32], sleepwalking [33], and nightmares [34] are all more prevalent in those experiencing mental health difficulties.The association between sleep and mental health is well documented [9,13,18e23].

        <p>Unfortunately, most research on the association between sleep and mental health is observational in design. While informative, inferring causation from such studies is difficult. For example, cross-sectional designs tell us that variables are associated in some way, but they cannot say whether one variable precedes the other in a causal chain [35]. Longitudinal designs provide stronger evidence, but are prone to residual confounding [36e38] and other forms of bias that limit causal inference [39e43]. The best evidence is provided by studies that randomly allocate participants to experimental and control conditions to minimise the effects of potential confounds [44,45]. Therefore, to establish whether sleeping problems are causally associated with mental health difficulties, it is necessary to experimentally manipulate sleep to see whether changes in sleep lead to changes in mental health over time (i.e., the interventionist approach to causation, [46]).Unfortunately, most research on the association between sleep and mental health is observational in design.

        <p>Many RCTs have examined the effect of interventions designed to improve sleep (typically cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, CBTi), on mental health (typically depression and anxiety). There have also been attempts to meta-analyse some of these RCTs and quantify their effects on mental health outcomes [47e50]. However, even these meta-analyses do not permit robust conclusions as to the causal impact of sleep on mental health outcomes for several reasons. First, previous reviews have included studies that did not successfully manipulate sleep (i.e., the intervention did not improve sleep relative to controls). It is not possible to conclude whether sleep is causally linked to mental health if the experimental manipulation of sleep is unsuccessful [51]. Indeed, these studies simply tell us that it can sometimes be difficult to improve sleep in the first place. Second, reviews have tended to examine the effect of interventions targeting sleep on mental health at the first post-intervention time point. This is problematic for two reasons; 1) there is no temporal lag between the measurement of sleep and measurement of mental health (a key tenet of causal inference); and 2) effects are limited to the short-term where they are likely to be strongest. Third, the focus of previous reviews has been limited to depression and anxiety only, and typically limited to CBTi interventions. Therefore, the effect of improving sleep on other mental health outcomes, using different approaches to intervention, is limited. Finally, to date there has been no or limited attempts to investigate variables that influence e or moderate e the impact of interventions that improve sleep on mental health. It is crucial that the impact of such variables is systematically examined to understand whether the effect of improving sleep on mental health differs across populations, settings, and study designs.Many RCTs have examined the effect of interventions designed to improve sleep (typically cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia, CBTi), on mental health (typically depression and anxiety).

        <p>The present review sought to address these issues to provide an accurate and robust estimate of the effect of changes in sleep quality (i.e., as a result of an intervention) on changes in mental health. To test this empirically, we identified randomised controlled trials that successfully manipulated sleep in an intervention group relative to controls, and then measured mental health at a later follow-up point. We did not limit the scope of interventions to CBTi, or the measures of mental health to solely depression and/or anxiety. Instead, we included any intervention designed to improve sleep that produced a statistically significant effect on sleep quality relative to controls and examined the effect of that improvement in sleep on any subsequent mental health outcome. To better isolate the effect of improved sleep on mental health, we excluded interventions that included specific elements targeting mental health (e.g., CBT elements for depression). Given the (potentially) high degree of heterogeneity between studies that this approach might create, we examined the effect of different study characteristics and outcomes using moderation analyses. Our primary hypothesis is that interventions that significantly improve sleep will lead to significantly improved mental health at follow-up.The present review sought to address these issues to provide an accurate and robust estimate of the effect of changes in sleep quality (i.e., as a result of an intervention) on changes in mental health.

        <p>To be included in the present review, studies needed to 1) be a randomized controlled trial that tested an intervention designed to improve sleep; 2) produce a statistically significant effect on sleep quality when compared to a control group or an alternative treatment, 3) report a measure of mental health subsequent to the measure of sleep quality, 4) report sufficient data to compute an effect size representing the impact of the intervention on both sleep quality and mental health, 5) be written in English, or translatable using available resources. In order to reliably and validly assess the independent contribution of changes in sleep on mental health outcomes among adult populations, studies were excluded if 1) the intervention contained elements that specifically target a mental health problem in addition to elements that target sleep; or 2) recruited children and young people (i.e., &lt;18 years of age).To be included in the present review, studies needed to 1) be a randomized controlled trial that tested an intervention designed to improve sleep; 2) produce a statistically significant effect on sleep quality when compared to a control group or an alternative treatment, 3) report a measure of mental health subsequent to the measure of sleep quality, 4) report sufficient data to compute an effect size representing the impact of the intervention on both sleep quality and mental health, 5) be written in English, or translatable using available resources.

        <p>The concept of 'improved sleep' is multifaceted and can mean different things to different people [54e56]. Consequently, one challenge for the proposed review was to ensure that included studies assessed a similar notion of improved sleep so that they could be meaningfully combined using a single metric. Therefore, we specified that primary studies reported a measure that reflected the overall quality of sleep experienced by participants. The concept of sleep quality can also be subjective [54]; however, broadly speaking, sleep quality consists of sleep continuity (e.g., sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and number of awakenings) and daytime impact (e.g., the extent to which the person feels refreshed on waking and throughout the day, see [54,57]). We used the following hierarchy to decide which outcome measure(s) to use to estimate an effect size (in descending order of prioritization); 1) self-report measures of global sleep quality (e.g., the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index); 2) outcomes specific to a given sleep disorder that assess sleep continuity and impact on daily life (e.g., the Insomnia Severity Index); and 3) individual components of selfreported sleep continuity aggregated to form a single composite effect size (e.g., the average effect of intervention on sleep onset latency (SoL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO)).The concept of 'improved sleep' is multifaceted and can mean different things to different people [54e56].

        <p>We examined the effect of improving sleep on 1) composite mental health (which included all mental health outcomes reported across studies, see Table 2 for outcomes), and 2) specific mental health difficulties in isolation (e.g., depression separately from other mental health outcomes). We computed the betweengroup effect of improving sleep on each mental health outcome reported by the study at the furthest follow-up point available. This strategy provides a stringent test of the effect of improving sleep on mental health outcomes in the sense that any changes need to have been maintained over time. In line with previous reviews [58], these effect sizes were then averaged to form a 'composite' measure of mental health. As with the measures of sleep quality, we prioritized self-report measures of mental health rather than observerrated measures, as arguably it is the subjective experience of mental health problems that is most important [59].We examined the effect of improving sleep on 1) composite mental health (which included all mental health outcomes reported across studies, see Table 2 for outcomes), and 2) specific mental health difficulties in isolation (e.g., depression separately from other mental health outcomes).

        <p>Risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias assessment criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration [60]. RCTs were classified as being at overall risk of bias according to three of the six domains e 1) allocation concealment, 2) blinding of outcome assessment and 3) completeness of outcome data (attrition). RCTs judged as being at low risk of bias for all three domains were judged at overall low risk of bias. RCTs judged as being at high risk for any of the three domains were judged as overall high risk of bias. RCTs judged as a mix of low and unclear risk on these three domains, or all unclear were judged as unclear with respect to risk of bias.Risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias assessment criteria developed by the Cochrane Collaboration [60].

The pooled, sample-weighted, average effect size was computed using a random effects model as effect sizes between studies are likely to vary considerably [67]. Following Cohen's recommendations [68], g ¼ 0.20 was taken to represent a 'small' effect size, g ¼ 0.50 a 'medium' effect size and g ¼ 0.80 a 'large' effect size. The I 2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity of effect sizes across the included studies and was interpreted according to the classifications suggested by Higgins et al. [69], where I 2 ¼ 25% indicates low heterogeneity, I 2 ¼ 50% indicates moderate heterogeneity, and I 2 ¼ 75% indicates high heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed via visual inspection of a funnel plot and Egger's test [70]. Additionally, Orwin's formula [71] was used to determine the fail-safe n. Finally, outliers were defined as any effect size for which the confidence intervals did not overlap with the confidence interval of the pooled effect [72]. We conducted a sensitivity analysis examining the effect of outliers for each outcome by rerunning the analysis with any outlying effect sizes removed.

        <p>Moderation analysis was conducted to identify variables that were associated with the effect of improving sleep on mental health outcomes. A minimum of three studies representing each moderator level category was required in order to conduct moderation analysis. For categorical variables, the analysis was based on a mixed effects model, in that the pooling of effect sizes within each moderator level was based on a random effects model, while the comparison of effect sizes between levels was based on a fixed effects model. The Q statistic was then used to assess whether effect sizes were significantly different between moderator levels. For continuous variables, sample-weighted meta-regression was used to investigate the impact of the moderator on mental health effect sizes.Moderation analysis was conducted to identify variables that were associated with the effect of improving sleep on mental health outcomes.

        <p>Is the smaller effect of improving sleep on mental health at longer follow-ups associated with smaller effects on sleep quality?.

        <p>Finally, although the present review excluded interventions that specifically and directly targeted mental health, some CBTi protocols include modules that might target similar processes associated with some mental health difficulties (rumination around sleep, catastrophizing over the effect of poor sleep etc.). Therefore, we compared CBTi interventions with modules that could target processes associated with mental health vs. interventions that did not include these modules (e.g., sleep restriction alone, sleep hygiene alone, herbal tea, and pharmacological intervention). There were no significant differences in the effect of improved sleep quality on mental health between CBTi interventions including modules addressing processes associated with mental health (g ¼ À0.44, 95% CI ¼ À0.59 to À0.29, p &lt; 0.001), relative to those that did not (g ¼ À0.48, 95% CI ¼ À0.65 to À0.32, p &lt; 0.001, Q ¼ 2.51, p ¼ 0.285).

        <p>The present review used meta-analysis to synthesize the effect of 72 interventions that improved sleep quality relative to a control condition on subsequent mental health. The findings revealed that improving sleep quality had, on average, a medium-sized effect on mental health, including clear evidence that improving sleep reduced depression, anxiety, and stress. A dearth of primary studies of other mental health difficulties (e.g., psychosis spectrum experiences, suicidal ideation, PTSD, rumination, and burnout) mean that it is premature to draw definitive conclusions in these areas. It was also notable that we found a doseeresponse relationship between improvements in sleep quality and subsequent mental health, such that greater improvements in sleep led to greater improvements in mental health. Although there was some evidence of publication bias, the effects remained robust to correction. Taken together, the findings suggest that improving sleep leads to better mental health, therefore providing strong evidence that sleep plays a causal role in the experience of mental health difficulties.The present review used meta-analysis to synthesize the effect of 72 interventions that improved sleep quality relative to a control condition on subsequent mental health.

        <p>The present findings support the idea that targeting sleep promotes mental health across a range of populations and experiences. The effect of improving sleep quality on composite mental health was medium-sized and statistically significant, regardless of the presence of physical and/or mental health comorbidities. This finding is particularly important given the healthcare challenges associated with multimorbidity [75] and mental and physical health problems often co-occur [76e79], something that appears to be increasing [80]. Consequently, it is important that the benefits of improving sleep on mental health occur even in the presence of comorbid health complaints, as was reported in the present research. Improving sleep has also been shown to improve aspects of physical health, including fatigue [81], chronic pain [82,83], and overall health related quality of life [84] and could reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, offering a digital CBTi intervention (Sleepio) to primary care patients was associated with an average saving of £70.44 per intervention user [85], and cost savings following sleep intervention have also been specifically reported in people with comorbid mental health difficulties such as depression [86].The present findings support the idea that targeting sleep promotes mental health across a range of populations and experiences.

For example, offering a digital CBTi intervention (Sleepio) to primary care patients was associated with an average saving of £70.44 per intervention user [85], and cost savings following sleep intervention have also been specifically reported in people with comorbid mental health difficulties such as depression [86].</p>
        <p>Another finding to suggest that targeting sleep could promote mental health across a range of populations and experiences, is that we found no difference in the effect of improving sleep quality on mental health between those with clinically defined mental health difficulties and those with non-clinical experiences or between those recruited from clinical vs. community settings, with both groups receiving significant benefits of improved sleep on mental health. This suggests that improving sleep could prove helpful across a range of mental health severities, thus broadening the possible impact of sleep interventions within healthcare services. Finally, there is growing evidence that sleep disturbances predict the development of mental health difficulties in the future. For example, shorter and more variable sleep has been shown to be longitudinally associated with more severe hallucinations and delusional ideation in those at high-risk of psychosis [87]. The present research found that improving sleep has a significant beneficial impact on future mental health in those with non-clinical experiences, raising the possibility that delivering interventions that improve sleep early might limit the risk of developing (or exacerbating) substantive mental health difficulties. Indeed, less severe mild-to-moderate presentations of mental health difficulties can develop over time into more severe mental health diagnoses [88,89], therefore improving sleep might be one tool that can be used in combination with others to limit the risk of transition.Another finding to suggest that targeting sleep could promote mental health across a range of populations and experiences, is that we found no difference in the effect of improving sleep quality on mental health between those with clinically defined mental health difficulties and those with non-clinical experiences or between those recruited from clinical vs. community settings, with both groups receiving significant benefits of improved sleep on mental health.

        <p>The present review has several strengths. First, it provides a comprehensive and up-to-date search of RCTs examining the effect of improving sleep on a variety of subsequent mental health outcomes. Indeed, with 65 RCTs and N ¼ 8608 participants, the present review is one of the largest studies of the effect of improving sleep on mental health to date. Second, the review was specifically designed to test the causal association between sleep and mental health (i.e., RCTs only, successful sleep improvement required, temporal lag between measures etc.). To our knowledge, the review is the first to adopt this approach in the field of sleep and mental health, although the general approach has been used in other fields [90]. Finally, we provide an analysis of possible moderators of the effect of improving sleep on mental health, identifying several key moderators of the effect. However, there are limitations that must be considered when interpreting the findings. First, relatively few studies examined the effect of improving sleep over the long term. Those that did report longer follow-ups generally found smaller effects (although still statistically significant), most likely due to the diminishing effects of interventions on sleep quality over time [91]. Consequently, it is important that interventions targeting sleep quality as a route to improving mental health seek to maintain their beneficial effects. Second, there were few primary studies for some of the outcomes included in this review. Consequently, in lieu of more studies reporting these outcomes, the inferences that we can make for mental health outcomes other than depression and anxiety are more limited. Third, although the intention of the present review was to include a broad range of sleep disturbances, most of the analyses are based on CBT interventions for insomnia. This might be due to the relationship between insomnia and mental health being the one that is historically most studied. However, it may be that our focus on sleep quality precluded some studies that do not focus on insomnia from inclusion. For example, different sleep disorders have different conceptualisations of improvement that might not include sleep quality. For example, the timing of sleep is particularly important in circadian rhythm disorders and daytime sleepiness is a key outcome in sleep apnoea research. Future research might consider examining the effect of improving specific sleep disorders on mental health by conceptualising improvements using sleep disorder specific outcomes.The present review has several strengths.

        <p>The present review highlighted several areas for future research in terms of both research and theory, and the implementation of findings in practice. First, given that mental health was measured on average around 20.5 weeks post-intervention in the primary studies, and that the effect of improving sleep on mental health significantly reduced over time, future research should examine the effect of improving sleep on mental health over the longer term. Second, although not uncommon, the majority of RCTs included in the present review were at high risk, or unclear risk or bias. Consequently, in addition to studying the effect of improving sleep over the longer term, on a range of mental health difficulties beyond depression and anxiety, we need more research at lower risk of methodological bias.The present review highlighted several areas for future research in terms of both research and theory, and the implementation of findings in practice.

        <p>Finally, although the present research provides evidence for a causal association between sleep and mental health, it is less clear how sleep effects mental health. One potential mechanism is whether and how people regulate their emotions (e.g., in response to negative events). Indeed, evidence suggests that poor sleep can amplify the adverse effect of negative life events [92,93], dull the beneficial impact of positive events [94], and is associated with more frequent use of emotion regulation strategies that might be detrimental to good mental health [95]. By extension, although we are unaware of RCTs testing the effect of improved sleep on emotion regulation, changes in sleep are prospectively associated with changes in aspects of emotion regulation [96,97], while experimentally induced sleep deprivation is adversely linked to poorer emotion regulation [96,97]. Contemporary perspectives on emotion regulation (e.g., the action control perspective), draw on research on how people regulate their behaviour, to propose that regulating emotions involves three tasks, 1) identifying the need to regulate, 2) deciding whether and how to regulate, and 3) enacting a regulation strategy [98]. We propose that poor sleep quality has the potential to adversely affect anyone (or all) of the three tasks involved in effectively regulating emotions, which might go some way toward explaining the relationship between poor sleep and mental health. Therefore, we would recommend that future research includes measures of aspects of emotion regulation (e.g., the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, [99]) within experimental and longitudinal designs to elucidate possible mechanisms by which improvements in sleep benefit mental health.Finally, although the present research provides evidence for a causal association between sleep and mental health, it is less clear how sleep effects mental health.

        <p>In terms of practice and implementation, evidence on the effect of sleep on mental health also supports calls for routine screening and treatment of problems with sleep. Both the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) and the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) recommend that primary health care training should include awareness of, and skills in assessing, sleep problems [100,101]. Despite this and a growing body of evidence, there has been little progress to date [102]. This may reflect under-appreciation of the importance of sleep [103] and lack of training and skills in assessing and managing sleep problems [104e108], as well as limited time and resources [103,109]. Therefore, a profitable next step might be to explore barriers and facilitators to assessing sleep and delivering effective interventions in specific care settings, from both the patient and clinician perspective. Indeed, the present review also highlighted a dearth of trials that tested the effect of improving sleep on mental health outcomes in 'real world' settings (e.g., within existing clinical and community health services). Although some researchers are taking important steps in this area [110e112], there is a clear need for more trials of interventions in clinical services so that the effectiveness and implementation of such interventions in routine care can be better understood.In terms of practice and implementation, evidence on the effect of sleep on mental health also supports calls for routine screening and treatment of problems with sleep.

        <p>Taken together, the present research supports the view that sleep is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties, and therefore that sleep represents a viable treatment target that can confer significant benefits to mental health, as it has been found to do for physical health. We found that improving sleep was associated with better mental health regardless of the severity of mental health difficulty (i.e., clinical vs. non-clinical) or the presence of comorbid health conditions. Poor sleep is almost ubiquitous within mental health services [102,108,113,114], is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties, and represents a potential treatment target [105,115,116]. Consequently, equipping health professionals with greater knowledge and resources to support sleep is an essential next step. Future research should consider how interventions that improve sleep could be better incorporated into routine mental health care, as well as the possible mechanisms of action that might explain how sleep exerts its effects on mental health.Taken together, the present research supports the view that sleep is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties, and therefore that sleep represents a viable treatment target that can confer significant benefits to mental health, as it has been found to do for physical health.

        <p>Sleep is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties and represents a viable transdiagnostic treatment target for those experiencing mental health difficulties. Improving sleep has beneficial effects on the experience of mental health difficulties, regardless of the severity of those difficulties, or the presence of comorbid health conditions. Healthcare professionals aiming to improve mental health (particularly depression, anxiety, and stress) should consider interventions designed to improve sleep, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia where the evidence base is strongest.Sleep is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties and represents a viable transdiagnostic treatment target for those experiencing mental health difficulties.
