        <p>Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: A total of 111 patients from four centers participated in the study. All tested positive for SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR. They were tested within 3 days of diagnosis and 28 to 169 days after infection. Testing included extensive olfactory testing with the Sniffin' Sticks test for threshold, discrimination and identification abilities, and with the Taste Sprays and Taste Strips for gustatory function for quasi-threshold and taste identification abilities.Study Design: Prospective cohort study.

        <p>Results: There was a significant difference in olfactory function during and after infection. During infection 21% were anosmic, 49% hyposmic, and 30% normosmic. After infection only 1% were anosmic, 26% hyposmic, and 73% normosmic. For gustatory function, there was a difference for all taste qualities, but significantly in sour, bitter, and total score. Twenty-six percent had gustatory dysfunction during infection and 6.5% had gustatory dysfunction after infection. Combining all tests 22% had combined olfactory and gustatory dysfunction during infection. After infection no patients had combined dysfunction.Results: There was a significant difference in olfactory function during and after infection.

        <p>Conclusions: Chemosensory dysfunction is very common in COVID-19, either as isolated smell or taste dysfunction or a combined dysfunction. Most people regain their chemosensory function within the first 28 days, but a quarter of the patients show persisting dysfunction, which should be referred to specialist smell and taste clinics for rehabilitation of chemosensory function.Conclusions: Chemosensory dysfunction is very common in COVID-19, either as isolated smell or taste dysfunction or a combined dysfunction.

        <p>The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 made olfactory and gustatory dysfunction known to everyone, although olfactory dysfunction is common in the general population. [1][2][3] Apart from aging and chronic rhinosinusitis one of the most frequent causes is postinfectious (post-viral) olfactory dysfunction with frequency rates of 31% to 39% of patients presenting at specialized smell and taste clinics. 4,5 Gustatory dysfunction is much less prevalent with a rate up to 5%. 6 This all changed dramatically in early 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic, as smell and taste dysfunction are among the most common symptoms of the disease-even in absence of other symptoms. Reported frequencies range from 0% to 98%. 7 Most studies are based on subjective findings, and only few studies have tested the dysfunction with psychophysical tests. [7][8][9][10][11] These studies mainly used self-administered tests or short and coarse screening tests of olfactory function. [12][13][14] Previous studies have found self-ratings of olfactory function unreliable and inaccurate. 15,16 For this reason, to provide us with deeper knowledge into COVID-19 detailed extensive objective tests are needed to truly access the related chemosensory dysfunction during the infection, but also to learn about recovery rates after infection. For this reason, the aim of this study was to objectively test chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients during infection and after the infection with the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test 17 for threshold, discrimination and identification, and the Taste Strips for detailed gustatory testing with quasi-threshold and identification abilities 18 -to evaluate olfactory and gustatory function and recovery during the course of the disease.The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 made olfactory and gustatory dysfunction known to everyone, although olfactory dysfunction is common in the general population.

        <p>Two methods of gustatory testing were used at various study sites, as available on site. A simple testing tool: Taste Sprays and a more detailed tool: Taste Strips. For screening of taste function the Taste Sprays were used. 19 The Taste Strips were used at the Department of Otolaryngology, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy. The Taste Sprays were used at the Head and Neck Surgery, Munich Clinic Schwabing, Academic Teaching Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany and Smell and Taste Clinic, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany. The taste sprays comprises sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste qualities in concentrations above threshold: sucrose (1 g in 10 ml water), citric acid (0.5 g in 10 ml water), sodium chloride (0.75 g in 10 ml water), and quinine hydrochloride (0.005 g in 10 ml water). The different sprays are sprayed in a pseudo-randomized order on the tongue of the participant. Then a forced-choice paradigm is used by asking the participant if the spray was sweet, sour, salty, or bitter. The participants could try the sprays up to three times. Gustatory dysfunction was assumed if participants failed to correctly identify two (or more) of the four sprays. If the participants failed to identify only one of the sprays, this was not regarded as dysfunction, due to the common taste quality confusion in the general population. 20,21 The Taste Strips (Burghart Messtechnik, Germany) is a more extensive test of gustatory function. 18 The Taste Strips is a gustatory test tool validated for testing identification and quasithreshold abilities for the four basic taste qualities of sweet, salty, bitter, and sour. The strips are presented to the participant in a pre-defined pseudo-randomized order for four different concentrations of each taste quality. 18 This test provides results for gustatory thresholds and identification abilities with a maximum score of 16. A higher score corresponds to a better gustatory function. Cut-off values used in this study were for hypogeusia a score ≤9 and for normogeusia a score ≥10. No cut-off values are available for ageusia, as this condition is extremely rare.Two methods of gustatory testing were used at various study sites, as available on site.

        <p>For testing of olfactory function, the present study used two methods for evaluating olfactory function by Sniffin' Sticks (Burghart Messtechnik, Germany), as available on site. The Sniffin' Sticks pens are felt-tip pens, containing odors as previously described by Hummel et al. 22 In the threshold and discrimination subtests participants are presented with three pens in a randomized order. In the identification test the participant identifies the correct odor by a forced multiple-choice paradigm of four written odor descriptors. For all sub-tests, a forced multiple-choice regime was used. The Sniffin' Sticks are presented in front of both nostrils with intervals of at least 30 seconds and approximately 3 seconds per individual pen. Most sites used the Sniffin' Sticks test consisting of three subtests, which provides scores for odor threshold (1-16), discrimination (0-16), and identification (0-16). The three scores are combined to a global olfactory function score consisting of threshold, discrimination and identification combined (TDI-score: 1-48). All sites except one used the TDI-test (n = 95). TDI-score cut-off value for anosmia (≤16), hyposmia (≤30.5), and normosmia (&gt;30.5) were used. [22][23][24] One site (Head and Neck Surgery, Munich Clinic Schwabing, Academic Teaching Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany) used the Sniffin' Sticks 12 Identification set (SIT-12) (n = 16). For this test the cut-off values for anosmia (≤6), hyposmia (7 ≤ and ≤ 10), and normosmia (score ≥ 11) were used in the present study. 25For testing of olfactory function, the present study used two methods for evaluating olfactory function by Sniffin' Sticks (Burghart Messtechnik, Germany), as available on site.

Based on a meta-analysis, the few objective studies to investigate olfactory function found proportions from 41% to 98%. 7 The meta-analysis of subjective and objective repots of olfactory dysfunction found a combined proportion of 69% (95% CI: 61%-77%). 7 This is in line with the current study that found olfactory dysfunction in 72% of patients during infection. We observed that olfactory dysfunction persisted in 27% during our follow-up period ranging from 28 to 169 days when combining the data from different sites.</p>
        <p>When only looking at patients re-tested from day 75 to 169 the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was still 20.5%. This is higher than previously reported by Vaira et al., which only found olfactory dysfunction in 7.2% after 60 days. 27 However, it also has to be kept in mind, when assessing results from studies (including this) on hyposmia that hyposmia is frequent in the general population, ranging from 13.3% to 18%. [1][2][3] This might over-estimate the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in studies like this, if not taken into account. If we subtract the prevalence from the general population, then the persisting olfactory dysfunction would be closer to 11% in this study, which would be consistent with the finding of 7.2% by Vaira et al. 27 However, the patients in the present study is generally younger, and thus the background prevalence is lower, as age is one of the primary indicators of hyposmia in the general population. 17 Adding to this, most of the participants noticed a sudden change in olfactory function, which might not have been noticed, were they previously hyposmic or anosmic. All in all this might indicate that the true prevalence could be the one without subtracting the prevalence of hyposmia in the general population, but the point should be taken into account by the reader when interpreting findings of studies of olfactory dysfunction. Most of our participants with persistent dysfunction only had hyposmia, while only a single patient persisted with functional anosmia (which was measured at day 28). Peculiarly, two patients (normosmic during infection) showed hyposmia after infection. None of the other patients exhibited a deteriorating olfactory function. When looking at gustatory dysfunction, most regained their sense of taste, and only four patients still had hypogeusia at follow-up. No patients had combined gustatory-and olfactory dysfunction at follow-up. It may be speculated that the transient character of taste dysfunction was due to a missing interaction between taste and smell on a central nervous level, which relatively quickly resolved during the course of the disorder. [28][29][30] Most of the other objective studies mainly used a selfadministered home-test kit. 12,31 A few studies have used (previously) validated tools for testing olfactory function, but these studies have only applied the Sniffin' Sticks identification set with 12 or 16 odors 14,32 -these test kits are commonly meant for the screening of olfactory dysfunction. A major advantage of the present study is the extensive evaluation of olfactory function in terms of threshold, discrimination, and identification abilities. The limitations of the study are that the number of participants for detailed gustatory function is quite limited, however, this is supplemented in the present study with more participants tested with the Taste Sprays. The study had a low dropout of 11 patients olfactory tested with the TDI and six with the SIT-12. It could be speculated that the participants did not show up for the follow-up due to the problem no longer being present, however, the patients were not contacted as to why they did not show up. There were 19 participants that were not re-tested at follow-up with the Taste Sprays, however, most of these 19 participants (except two) had a normal function at first test. Although the present study only used a single follow-up for each participant, and it should be interesting to see several follow-ups, however, as different sites used follow-up times varying from 28 to 169 days, this does give an overview of the chemosensory function at various timepoints after infection.When only looking at patients re-tested from day 75 to 169 the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was still 20.5%.

        <p>In conclusion, our results seem to indicate that most people with COVID-associated chemosensory dysfunction regain smell and taste within the first 28 days, which is in line with previous studies. However, up to a quarter of the patients seems to exhibit a longer-lasting dysfunction-higher than previously expected. 27 These patients should be referred to specialist smell and taste clinics for the rehabilitation of chemosensory function. 33In conclusion, our results seem to indicate that most people with COVID-associated chemosensory dysfunction regain smell and taste within the first 28 days, which is in line with previous studies.
