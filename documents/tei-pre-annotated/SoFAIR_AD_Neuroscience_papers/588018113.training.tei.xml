        <p>ASCERTAIN is a database that correlates emotions with physiological measures obtained through various devices, such as EEG, resulting in nonlinear relationships that are suitable for understanding the correlation between emotion and physiological response. This was verified by analyzing the EEG signal from a NeuroSky device, extracting from the collected data the average of the first derivative, the proportion of negative differential samples, the average number of peaks and the average derivative of the inverse channel signal. For some of these statistics,

        <p>This study deals with the development of an EEG and ECG database, matching these values with audiovisual stimuli for different emotional contents [4]. For the development of this database, the EMOTIV EPOCH helmet with 14 electrodes was used. From this study, it should be noted that, for data processing, we used a normalization of the data captured from the stimuli with respect to a baseline captured immediately before the stimulus. This operation allows the removal of residual activity existing before the stimulus was taken. In this sense, the data are measured with respect to a reference [4]. It should be noted that only the Theta, Alpha and Beta frequency bands are analyzed through their spectral density indices.This study deals with the development of an EEG and ECG database, matching these values with audiovisual stimuli for different emotional contents [4].

        <p>Because time-varying EEG data are affected by artifacts and have small and highly variable voltage values, EEG-based studies generally perform frequency-domain analyses, determining oscillatory patterns of electrical fluctuations occurring between neurons in the brain. These tend to be more stable than the temporal information provided by raw EEG data signals and provide information about the amount of electrical energy provided by the brain in a given pattern (or, rather, frequency) of oscillation. These oscillation patterns are usually of low frequency (1 to 40 Hz), where each range denotes a different physiological state with respect to the brain electrical activity that the subject has. Table No. 2 shows the different brain waves with their respective frequency limits according to [1]; However, in the case of this article, the brain wave limits are considered according to [4], since, as some of the signals presented in the DREAMER dataset are intended to be analyzed, it is considered appropriate to adapt the same frequency. limits used for this study.

        <p>The Power Spectral Density (PSD) present in a signal indicates the distribution of the signal power distributed in each frequency band present in the signal, thus being able to establish the bands in which the greatest amount of signal power is concentrated. This is practical when analyzing such behavior in frequency since it is possible to easily discriminate the frequency intervals than if a time domain analysis of the signal were performed.

            <rs type="software">Matlab</rs> one should use the command "bandpower" which is a proprietary function to which the input signal (x) is entered and returns the power average (p); by the following command: "p= bandpower(x)". If the input signal (x) is a matrix, then the function "bandpower" will return the average power in each column independently [10].

This index has been used in different studies as a parameter to quantify the physiological response of the brain in comparison with other indexes of brain activity that are related to the theta band; example of these studies is [4] and [11].

        <p>As for the data collection for 
            <rs type="software">DREAMER</rs>, which is only in females, the stimuli were extracted from one with responses to these stimuli related to the project. To process both the data acquired by 
            <rs type="software">NeuroSky</rs> and those extracted from 
            <rs type="software">DREAMER</rs>, it was decided to create a code that extracted the PSD for each brain band of analysis (Theta, Alpha and Beta) for both the stimulus and the baseline. These data were recorded in several tables shown in the results section below. As for the In general terms, the code only consists of loading the EEG data, selecting the analysis electrodes in the case of the DREMAER, and for the information of each electrode, several filterings are performed on the signal so that the signal is found within the frequency ranges corresponding to each frequency band. With this, the data are computed with the

        <p>After performing the procedures explained in the previous section, the following results were obtained. In the case of NeuroSky, the PSD of each brain frequency band was compared between each subject together with their valence and excitation data. The results are shown in Table 4.After performing the procedures explained in the previous section, the following results were obtained. In the case of NeuroSky, the PSD of each brain frequency band was compared between each subject together with their valence and excitation data. The results are shown in Table 4.</p>
        <p>From these data it can be seen that there is a correspondence between the EEG data and the subjective valence and arousal scores when these scores are compared with the PSD of each brain frequency band; Slight differences are observed between each subject, which may be due to the fact that, as indicated by several studies involving the comparison between subjective and physiological tests, the test subjects may be biased as to what they think they feel in front of the stimuli, while with physiological tests we have the scoop that "the body does not lie", having a more adequate approximation to what the person feels in front of the stimuli.From these data it can be seen that there is a correspondence between the EEG data and the subjective valence and arousal scores when these scores are compared with the PSD of each brain frequency band; Slight differences are observed between each subject, which may be due to the fact that, as indicated by several studies involving the comparison between subjective and physiological tests, the test subjects may be biased as to what they think they feel in front of the stimuli, while with physiological tests we have the scoop that "the body does not lie", having a more adequate approximation to what the person feels in front of the stimuli.</p>
        <p>Observing the subjective test scores, there is a correspondence between the emotion that each stimulus was intended to produce, since all subjects gave scores that belonged to the category of valence and arousal that the original sound stimuli had, being HVHA high in valence and arousal. The LVHA is low in valence and high in excitation and the NVNA is neutral in valence and excitation, so it is correct to state that the sound stimuli produce, taking into account the subjective test, the emotions that were expected to be obtained.Observing the subjective test scores, there is a correspondence between the emotion that each stimulus was intended to produce, since all subjects gave scores that belonged to the category of valence and arousal that the original sound stimuli had, being HVHA high in valence and arousal.

        <p>On the other hand, when comparing the PSD between subjects, it is easy to identify which stimulus activated each subject more. Arousal values given by the subject, where a happy and calm stimulus is evident; having more energy in Alpha than in the others, it is valid to say that the subject felt calm and relaxed, in a point between the conscious and the unconscious, which is also evident in the Arousal score where, for this subject, the stimulus tends to be relaxing in terms of arousal. 5 shows that, at a general level, stimulus No. 1, which is related to calmness, is the one with more energy in the Alpha and Beta frequency bands.On the other hand, when comparing the PSD between subjects, it is easy to identify which stimulus activated each subject more.

        <p>For these data it was also appropriate to obtain the PSD plots for the 14 electrodes considered, so that it could be observed in which parts of the brain the highest energy is observed; this is shown in Fig. 6. From here it is possible to observe the variation of each stimulus at the spectral level of the signal, noting that the fear stimulus (stimulus 2) has more abrupt peaks and greater presence of energy in the high-frequency bands.For these data it was also appropriate to obtain the PSD plots for the 14 electrodes considered, so that it could be observed in which parts of the brain the highest energy is observed; this is shown in Fig. 6.
