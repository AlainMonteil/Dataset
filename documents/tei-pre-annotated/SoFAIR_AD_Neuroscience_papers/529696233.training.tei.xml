        <p>Achieving robust, intuitive, simultaneous and proportional control over multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) is an outstanding challenge in the development of myoelectric prosthetic systems. Since the priority in myoelectric prosthesis solutions is robustness and stability, their number of functions is usually limited. Objective: Here, we introduce a system for intuitive concurrent hand and wrist control, based on a robust feature-extraction protocol and machine-learning. Methods: Using the mean absolute value of high-density EMG, we train a ridgeregressor (RR) on only the sustained portions of the single-DOF contractions and leverage the regressor's inherent ability to provide simultaneous multi-DOF estimates. In this way, we robustly capture the amplitude information of the inputs while harnessing the power of the RR to extrapolate otherwise noisy and often overfitted estimations of dynamic portions of movements. Results: The real-time evaluation of the system on 13 able-bodied participants and an amputee shows that almost all single-DOF tasks could be reached (96% success rate), while at the same time users were able to complete most of the two-DOF (62%) and even some of the very challenging three-DOF tasks (37%).Achieving robust, intuitive, simultaneous and proportional control over multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) is an outstanding challenge in the development of myoelectric prosthetic systems.

        <p>U PPER limb deficiency is a consequence of traumatic in- cidents, underlying pathological conditions, comorbidity or a genetic predicament. The resulting functional impairment affects almost every aspect of daily living. For most acquired amputations, and some congenital limb disorders, prosthetic fittings are offered as a primary form of functional support. Most commercially available prosthetic hands provide a small number of selected functions, such as grasping and some form of wrist adjustment, which are controlled individually in a proportional fashion [1]. The most advanced systems rely on the use of surface electromyography (EMG) to establish an interface that decodes the user's motor intent [2].U PPER limb deficiency is a consequence of traumatic in- cidents, underlying pathological conditions, comorbidity or a genetic predicament.

        <p>Commercial myoelectric devices detect EMG signals from an antagonistic pair of remnant muscles (e.g. wrist flexors/extensors) and map them into proportional control of the available prosthetic functions (e.g. gripper open/close) [1]. The access to other available prosthetic degrees of freedom (DOFs), such as wrist rotation, is gained by introducing a switching event that can be determined by a cocontraction or a pulsed signal [3]. While highly robust, this state machine control is unnatural and not suited for restoring dexterous functions. For this reason, myoelectric prostheses have a high rate of abandonment by patients [4].Commercial myoelectric devices detect EMG signals from an antagonistic pair of remnant muscles (e.g. wrist flexors/extensors) and map them into proportional control of the available prosthetic functions (e.g. gripper open/close) [1].

        <p>More recent control approaches consist of EMG signal classification across a finite set of classes (prosthetic functions) [5]- [7] and regression over multiple DOFs [8]. While classification methods usually provide a sequential control (one function at a time), regression-based controllers inherently support concurrent activations of multiple functions. On the other hand, robust regression control of more than two DOFs in transradial amputees has been proven challenging. In Hahne et. al. [9] such a system is investigated in ADLlike assessment tasks. They claim, increasing the number of DOFs to control beyond two becomes unfeasibly due to increased number of combinations to train [10]. In Ortiz-Catalan et. al. [11] a three-DOF control is reported using a different control approach than the one to be introduced in this work and the one presented by Hahne et. al. [9]. Instead of controlling the position of a prosthesis directly (position control), the velocity to reach a certain DOF configuration is commanded. This allows a wearer to perform a multi-DOF activation either by sequential or simultaneous activation of the involved DOFs. Ortiz-Catalan et. al. [11] do not indicate the amount of simultaneous activation present in reaching twoor three-DOF tasks. In Smith et. al. [12] on the other hand, a further study involving a three-DOF controller, the usage of simultaneity is explicitly investigated. The highest taskspecific percentage reported is less than 50% (two-DOF tasks). All these approaches require explicit training of combined activations and only in Hahne et. al. [9] simultaneous two-DOF activation is required to achieve the respective goals.More recent control approaches consist of EMG signal classification across a finite set of classes (prosthetic functions) [5]- [7] and regression over multiple DOFs [8].

        <p>A further challenge in current myoelectric controllers is the lack of robustness in the presence of instabilities due to altered motor control [13] and methodological factors [14], [15]. Certain academic efforts have been dedicated into tackling this issue [16]- [18] however, a clinically viable solution is yet to be found. At the same time, the induced controller instabilities lead to a lack of predictability which is paramount for establishing an engaging human-machine interface [19]- [21].A further challenge in current myoelectric controllers is the lack of robustness in the presence of instabilities due to altered motor control [13] and methodological factors [14], [15].

        <p>Moreover, the usage of more complex control algorithms, e.g. non-linear ones, has not led to significant improvement compared to simpler ones, e.g. linear models [22], [23]. An example of advanced algorithms was presented by Ameri et. al. [24]. The study evaluates a regression convolutional neural network offline and in a two-DOF goal-reaching task. Impressive advantages of this approach are a 100% success rate and no need to engineer EMG features. However, these results require training of simultaneous activations (difficult for higher number of DOFs), a velocity control (yet a very high level of simultaneous activation can be seen in the results), and additional engineering required for the design and tuning of the neural network. Furthermore, the possibility for a user to consistently anticipate the behaviour of the controller allows the simpler solutions to harness the power of human motor learning and thus effectively increase the robustness of the interface [25], [26].Moreover, the usage of more complex control algorithms, e.g. non-linear ones, has not led to significant improvement compared to simpler ones, e.g. linear models [22], [23].

        <p>Taking all these points into consideration and in order to avoid negative effects of overfitting [27], we propose a three DOFs simultaneous and proportional estimator of wrist and hand actions based on ridge-regression which is trained only on the sustained portions (steady state) of single-DOF contractions, but is tested on multiple activation levels and multi-DOF activation (up to three-DOF combinations). Since our approach resembles a position control scheme, two-and three-DOF targets can only be reached using simultaneous activation. Controlling multiple DOFs simultaneously and proportionally has been investigated using high-density EMG under various arrangements employing a velocity control approach, which not necessarily requires simultaneous activation [28], [29].Taking all these points into consideration and in order to avoid negative effects of overfitting [27], we propose a three DOFs simultaneous and proportional estimator of wrist and hand actions based on ridge-regression which is trained only on the sustained portions (steady state) of single-DOF contractions, but is tested on multiple activation levels and multi-DOF activation (up to three-DOF combinations).

        <p>In this study we focus on the translational potential of our approach. Therefore, we tested the robustness of the performance not only using a high-density EMG with 192 sensors, but also with a reduced sensor arrangement with 16 sensors. Robustness here refers to control stability, e.g. due to changes in the signal during the experiment. The influence of electrode shift or other perturbations are not explicitly tested. To evaluate our approach, we conducted a set of real-time onscreen tests with a group of able-bodied participants and an amputee.In this study we focus on the translational potential of our approach.

        <p>In order to provide the users with predictable, intuitive and robust myocontrol, the established interface should ideally be consistent and transparent in the way it maps the inputs (the EMG signals) into output control commands (prosthetic motions). This may be achieved by providing as close to linear mapping as possible, and by ensuring system robustness through appropriate signal conditioning and output estimation algorithm design (training) procedure. In this section we describe our proposal for designing this system.

        <p>EMG signal processing: In order to provide robust inputs to the motion estimation algorithm, the raw acquired EMG signal is filtered by a 5th order Butterworth bandpass filter in the frequency range 20Hz-500Hz. Furthermore, in order to compensate for power-line interference, a 2nd order Butterworth band stop filter with cut-off frequencies 45Hz and 55Hz was applied to the signal. Then, the envelope of the filtered EMG signals was used as input to the regressor. EMG amplitude envelope was selected as it is a robust, commonly used signal feature in myocontrol, which is linearly related to force [31]. The envelope was extracted from the raw EMG by estimates of the root mean square (RMS) values in 100ms intervals with an overlap of 90ms. No channel-wise normalisation was performed, in order to avoid amplification of channels with low signal-to-noise ratio, which could negatively influence the regressor.EMG signal processing: In order to provide robust inputs to the motion estimation algorithm, the raw acquired EMG signal is filtered by a 5th order Butterworth bandpass filter in the frequency range 20Hz-500Hz.

        <p>Machine Learning: In order to decode user intention, a Ridge Regression motion estimation algorithm was employed. The algorithm needs to be trained using representatively labelled EMG data. Contrary to previous regression studies in myocontrol [12], [22], [32], we propose to train the algorithm exclusively on data recorded during steady (constant force) contractions while omitting the dynamic segments from the training set. This approach to training is commonly used with classification methods [33]- [35], but can support users who have difficulties with phantom movements [36], [37]. Here it is chosen in order to reduce the training data variability which reinforces the linear behaviour of the controller, thus potentially increasing the robustness by ensuring the predictability of the controller. Similar ideas have been used to deal with uncertainties in classification approaches [38].Machine Learning: In order to decode user intention, a Ridge Regression motion estimation algorithm was employed.

        <p>Resulting Controller: For the purpose of providing control over multiple DOFs, each DOF is assigned to one regressor, which is trained on both extends of the DOF, e.g. the DOF wrist rotation is trained with both wrist pronation (y = 1) and wrist supination (y = -1). The output of the controller are real numbers in the range of -1 to 1 and correspond to the activation of a certain DOF rather than to specific forces or joint angles. Therefore, the user is able to utilise the full spectrum of intermediate and/or combined gesture activations, even though only the full activations of individual gestures have been collected during ML training. In order to further improve user experience, depending on the personal preferences, either a fifth or a seventh-order moving-average filter was applied to the predicted output values effectively reducing the control jitter. With the windowing of 100ms and the delay introduced by the output filtering, the perceived delay remained well under the real-time threshold of 300ms [43]. Considering the treatment of the input signals, the applied motion estimation algorithm, and the conditioning of the estimated outputs, the overall control strategy proposed here provides a near-linear translation of EMG readings from the forearm to estimated activations of DOFs of the wrist and hand.

Any data corresponding to the transition between relaxed and steady state was neglected as previously described.In order to train the Ridge Regression estimation algorithm, the subjects were first instructed, using the visual cues shown in Figure 1c, to perform three repetitions of the desired gestures at a strong, but comfortable levels of force.

        <p>These targets were presented to the user in an abstract fashion, as already done in previous studies [45], [46]. This experimental protocol meets the requirements of the later defined Target Achievement Control (TAC) test [47]. Figure 1c shows the goal-reaching UI with two vertical arrows. These arrows were shown on the screen and the user was asked to For each of the DOFs, the arrow would change one of its properties. Translation movement left and right was controlled using the wrist flexion and wrist extension, rotation was controlled using wrist pronation and wrist supination and performing a power grasp made the arrow shrink. The objective of each task was to reach the target and to remain in its proximity (the error threshold was set to 15% of the normalised work space) for at least 0.3s. Leaving the target area led to a reset of this dwell time. The user had 20s to complete each task, after which the next target was displayed. Reaching the target area was visually indicated to the participant by a change of colour of the arrow from yellow to green. The colour changed back to yellow if the user left the target area. In case the task was not successfully accomplished and the timeout of 20s was reached, the colour of the target changed to red and the user was instructed to fully relax before resetting for the next task.These targets were presented to the user in an abstract fashion, as already done in previous studies [45], [46].

        <p>A total of 24 targets comprised of either individual gestures, such as power grasp, or combinations, such as concurrent activation of power grasp and wrist pronation, were shown to the participants. An added difficulty to the testing was included by introducing intermediate levels of these actions. This was done for both individual gestures, e.g. 30% wrist pronation, as well as for combinations, e.g. 30% wrist pronation combined with 80% power grasp. The targets with the highest difficulty were those which involved a combination of gestures along all three DOFs. Given that the system evaluation focused on the viability of the solution, the overall selection of tasks was based on the ability to conduct robust systematic testing while ensuring not to overburden and fatigue the participants. This meant selecting task activation levels in relation to the increasing difficulty of the concurrent DOF manipulation [47] and thus focusing on the combination levels which are more commonly used during ADLs [48]. A list of gestures used for both training the algorithm and real-time testing is reported in Table I and a visualisation of the execution of ten randomly selected tasks can be found in the Supplementary Material. Furthermore, the Supplementary Material also contains a short clip of the amputee performing a task.A total of 24 targets comprised of either individual gestures, such as power grasp, or combinations, such as concurrent activation of power grasp and wrist pronation, were shown to the participants. An added difficulty to the testing was included by introducing intermediate levels of these actions. This was done for both individual gestures, e.g. 30% wrist pronation, as well as for combinations, e.g. 30% wrist pronation combined with 80% power grasp.

        <p>The primary performance measure was Success, which determines whether the participant is able to successfully complete the task of reaching a goal. Successful tasks were further analysed with three secondary performance measures: TimeToReach, Speed and PathEfficiency. TimeToReach indicates the time it takes a user to successfully accomplish a task, Speed is the ratio between the length of the path travelled and TimeToReach, and PathEfficiency is the ratio of the length of the shortest path from start (origin of the UI shown in Figure 1c) to endpoint (target location) and the length of the path actually taken by the user.The primary performance measure was Success, which determines whether the participant is able to successfully complete the task of reaching a goal.

        <p>The primary and each of the three secondary measures were analysed individually. The tasks were chosen to cover several relevant aspects of simultaneous and proportional control. These properties were the independent factors in the statistical evaluation and their values can be found in Table I in columns 6-10 (TargetDOFs to AccLvl). TargetDOFs is a factor with three levels which denote the number of DOFs involved in a task (1 stands for individual gesture goals, while 2 and 3 stand for combinations of 2 or 3 gestures in a goal). wFlex/Ext, wRot and wGrasp indicate whether the corresponding DOF is present in a given task or not. AccLvl is the summation of the levels of activation for each gesture involved in a goal. This parameter tells the extent to which each gesture involved in the task should be activated. A further factor (not listed in Table I) is SensorNumber, which indicates whether the experiment was conducted with a full set of 192 sensors or the reduced set of 16 sensors.The primary and each of the three secondary measures were analysed individually.

Calculating the Spearman and Kendall correlation confirms this notion with values of ρ = 0.93 and τ = 0.87, respectively. Due to the stepwise factor-reduction process the influence of this property should be minimal as the addition to the explained variance is low and therefore one factor is discarded early.From the initial list of six factor introduced in Subsection III-D at most two remain per model.

        <p>In this study we demonstrated real-time simultaneous and proportional myocontrol over three DOFs of hand and wrist using EMG signals from the forearm muscles. The proposed paradigm enables intuitive control by relying on almost linear mapping between input commands and the target output gestures. This is achieved using a simple Ridge Regression motion estimation algorithm trained only on three repetitions of single-DOF steady-state contractions corresponding to the desired motions. The translational potential of this approach has been investigated in real-time experiments with both ablebodied subjects and an amputee, and by eventually reducing the number of EMG channels to a subset of sensors corresponding in number to those present in commercially available prostheses.In this study we demonstrated real-time simultaneous and proportional myocontrol over three DOFs of hand and wrist using EMG signals from the forearm muscles.

        <p>Throughout the evaluation of the proposed control algorithm, from the plots shown in Figure 3 and the statistical model analysis presented in Section IV-A, we can conclude that the number of factors that truly influence the control performance is relatively small. Looking into specifics of the observed metrics, there are three main findings to highlight.Throughout the evaluation of the proposed control algorithm, from the plots shown in Figure 3 and the statistical model analysis presented in Section IV-A, we can conclude that the number of factors that truly influence the control performance is relatively small. Looking into specifics of the observed metrics, there are three main findings to highlight.</p>
        <p>First, the proposed approach is capable of extending single DOF control to two and even three DOF control at no additional effort (system training is done only on single-DOF data). The extension to multiple DOF is associated to a decrease in performance in complex tasks, however, the additional capability does not compromise the single-DOF control, which remained at a high success rate. Around and ca. 25% respectively for linear feature. Focus of the study has been the comparison between a linear and a nonlinear feature. Dealing with combinations of finger activations requires addressing a high level of physiological coupling [39]. Non-linear features can be beneficial in this scenario [40]. These and other more powerful features are potential avenues for improving our control. Furthermore, while a number of studies have used regression for natural combination of DOFs (for an overview see [55]), a simultaneous combination of three DOFs over wrist and hand with proportional capabilities using intuitive mapping has not been experimentally evaluated so far. Smith et. al. [12] and Ortiz-Catalan et. al. [11] have both performed studies regarding simultaneous and proportional control. Both studies have reached success rate similar to ours of more than 90%. These rates have also been achieved in combined tasks, while the performance in our study was significantly lower. However, in said studies the combined activations have been trained explicitly and velocity control was employed. The latter allows the participant to reach multi-DOF targets without using simultaneous activations of these DOFs. Our controller does not require explicit training and yet allows the participants to perform multi-DOF activations. Therefore, in 100% of our multi-DOF tasks simultaneity was used, while simultaneity was used in less than 50% of cases in [12]. Ortiz-Catalan et. al. [11] did not report the usage of simultaneity during target reaching. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the control over the power grasp (wGrasp) seemed to have been more challenging than other gestures for able-bodied subjects and yet easier for the amputee. This was presumably due to a larger variance present in the data related to this movement as it involves more prominent co-activation of different muscle groups. As a further remark, the power grasp was the only DOF that had four different levels instead of three for the remaining DOFs. Additional emphasis was put on said DOF due to its importance in prosthetic control. This could have resulted in an unintentional additional difficulty in activating this DOF. On the other hand, the amputee performed better in tasks involving the power grasp. An explanation could be that he is a longterm (more than 5 years of daily use) user of a myoelectric prosthesis with hand open and close functionality. Therefore, while acknowledging that this is a consideration based only on a single subject, the increase in performance on this particular DOF could be attributed to previous training and the frequent, isolated use of the specific muscles related to this particular function.First, the proposed approach is capable of extending single DOF control to two and even three DOF control at no additional effort (system training is done only on single-DOF data).

        <p>Second, the performance of the proposed system remained consistent even with a reduced number of input channels. To demonstrate the translational potential of the approach, we decreased the number of EMG channels from 192 to 16 (Figure 1b), which is a number comparable to that of sensors already available in advanced commercial solutions [5], [6]. Although we use the 16 individual sensors in a monopolar configuration, the technical complexity of such a configuration is not significantly different from an 8-channel differential arrangement, as it can be found in said commercial solutions. This reduction in number of electrodes had no significant impact on any of the observed measures. This outcome is consistent with previous work on both regression-and classification-based estimators for myocontrol [46], [56], [57]. Muceli et al. [46] have shown that a channel reduction from 192 to 6 does not negatively influence regression-based user performance, Amma et al. [56] demonstrated that going from 168 to ca. 20 sensors yields a decrease in performance from ca. 95% to ca. 80% and Rojas-Martínez et al. [57] have come to a similar result when reducing from 342 -354 channels to 27. However, our study is the first that successfully demonstrates such resilience during concurrent control of three DOFs of wrist and hand. This is an important observation, since in the process of embedding a myocontroller in a prosthetic device, a lower number of sensors can be beneficial as it drastically reduces the overall technical complexity of the device. An offline analysis further supports the online findings of no significant influence of the sensor reduction. Based on the four subject that participated in the second part of the experiment, we have used the training data of the online experiment to train four regressors with different sensor configurations, i.e. all 192 sensors, the optimal 16 sensors, the optimal eight sensor pairs, and our uniform configuration of eight sensor pairs. In a repetition-wise three-fold cross-validation we evaluated two measures of fit, i.e. R2 and normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) using a forward search based on Ridge Regression adding iteratively the channels that results in the best fit. The results can be found in Table III. The uniform sensor configuration has a lower fit of the data then the full sensor configuration or the optimal selection. However, in the online scenario this difference proves not to be significant. Furthermore, the optimal channel selection yields a better fit of the data then the full 192 channels, which could indicate overfit in the full-channel configuration. Since the user-specific optimal channel selection yields a better fit than the uniform selection, a potential improvement could be achieved with individual sensor placement per user. Third, while using the proposed control approach an amputee was similarly successful in completing the presented tasks as other subjects. However, he took longer to complete them and his PathEfficiency was lower than the one from the remaining participants. While these results have to be considered cautiously since based on a single patient, they indicate that the proposed system has the potential to be used by amputees.Second, the performance of the proposed system remained consistent even with a reduced number of input channels. To demonstrate the translational potential of the approach, we decreased the number of EMG channels from 192 to 16 (Figure 1b), which is a number comparable to that of sensors already available in advanced commercial solutions [5], [6]. Although we use the 16 individual sensors in a monopolar configuration, the technical complexity of such a configuration is not significantly different from an 8-channel differential arrangement, as it can be found in said commercial solutions. This reduction in number of electrodes had no significant impact on any of the observed measures.

[46] have shown that a channel reduction from 192 to 6 does not negatively influence regression-based user performance, Amma et al. [56] demonstrated that going from 168 to ca. 20 sensors yields a decrease in performance from ca. 95% to ca. 80% and Rojas-Martínez et al. [57] have come to a similar result when reducing from 342 -354 channels to 27.

This is an important observation, since in the process of embedding a myocontroller in a prosthetic device, a lower number of sensors can be beneficial as it drastically reduces the overall technical complexity of the device.

However, in the online scenario this difference proves not to be significant. Furthermore, the optimal channel selection yields a better fit of the data then the full 192 channels, which could indicate overfit in the full-channel configuration. Since the user-specific optimal channel selection yields a better fit than the uniform selection, a potential improvement could be achieved with individual sensor placement per user. Third, while using the proposed control approach an amputee was similarly successful in completing the presented tasks as other subjects. However, he took longer to complete them and his PathEfficiency was lower than the one from the remaining participants. While these results have to be considered cautiously since based on a single patient, they indicate that the proposed system has the potential to be used by amputees.</p>
        <p>Beyond these main findings, from Figures 3d and 3e it could be argued that for higher AccLvl the oscillation and the instability of the provided control increases. This could be explained by the fact that with increasing AccLvl, and therefore also with a rise in number of DOFs that need to be addressed (TargetDOFs), the user has to navigate the controller in an area where the algorithm was not explicitly trained. This potentially leads to a more jittery behaviour, which is emphasized by the fact that there is no significant difference for PathEfficiency between two-and three-DOF tasks. System training data only consisted of single-DOF motions, thus when reaching for the targets that require combined movements, the control may become more unstable. Besides the influence of the training data a reduced PathEfficiency can also be explained by physiological aspects. A theoretical combination of e.g. wrist flexion and power grasp at their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) is physiologically not possible [58]. These properties have been taken into account for the design of the goal-reaching tasks. However, specific combinations can pose added difficulty and could require less efficient reaching paths. Physiological aspects could explain the different performance for tasks involving the power grasp. Potentially, this unstable behaviour could be alleviated by the user gaining more experience with the controller [26] or an incremental learning scheme [41] to update training data when needed. Nevertheless, the benefit of having a very simple and quick system training, and the fact that single-DOF control remains high with combined actions still well handled, arguably outweighs the observed reduction in performance.Beyond these main findings, from Figures 3d and 3e it could be argued that for higher AccLvl the oscillation and the instability of the provided control increases.

        <p>We have proposed and demonstrated a system for simultaneous and proportional real-time EMG control over 3-DOFs with an intuitive interface, and minimal user and machine training. This was done by training a Ridge Regression algorithm solely on steady portions of three repetitions of the single DOF dynamic contractions of wrist and hand. Such design choice has allowed us to reduce the influence of data variability introduced by dynamic inputs and to leverage on the simplicity of the estimator.We have proposed and demonstrated a system for simultaneous and proportional real-time EMG control over 3-DOFs with an intuitive interface, and minimal user and machine training.

        <p>/3 of the tasks involving two DOFs and 1 /3 of the tasks involving three DOFs could be successfully completed, even though these combinations had not been specifically trained. Furthermore, proportional control over up to three DOFs was achieved without explicitly training on the dynamic portion of the training data. Potential challenges that arise from these training data segments have been linearly interpolated by the controller. Another approach is treating these segments as classes of their own[17],[18]. Similar trends and performance values have been observed previously[54], however, only two DOFs of the wrist have been considered. Barsotti et. al.[40] performed a study only training on individual DOFs and predicting combined activation for up to five finger activations. Both the SR for individual and simultaneous targets are comparable, but lower than in our study, with ca. 85%/3 of the tasks involving two DOFs and 1 /3 of the tasks involving three DOFs could be successfully completed, even though these combinations had not been specifically trained.
