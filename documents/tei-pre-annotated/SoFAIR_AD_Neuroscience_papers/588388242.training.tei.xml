        <p>There is a lot of evidence establishing that nervous system development is related to the composition and functions of the gut microbiome. In addition, the central nervous system (CNS) controls the imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, constituting a bidirectional communication system. At present, various gut-brain crosstalk routes have been described, including immune, endocrine and neural circuits via the vagal pathway. Several empirical data have associated gut microbiota alterations (dysbiosis) with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and Parkinson's disease, and with other psychological disorders, like anxiety and depression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy has shown that the gut microbiota can transfer behavioral features to recipient animals, which provides strong evidence to establish a causal-effect relationship. Interventions, based on prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics, have demonstrated an important influence of microbiota on neurological disorders by the synthesis of neuroactive compounds that interact with the nervous system and by the regulation of inflammatory and endocrine processes. Further research is needed to demonstrate the influence of gut microbiota dysbiosis on psychiatric and psychological disorders, and how microbiotabased interventions may be used as potential therapeutic tools.</p>
        <p>The human microbiome is composed of a diverse microbial population that colonizes several human tissues, such as skin, mucosa, gut, and respiratory and urogenital tracts (Gilbert and Lynch, 2019;Reynoso-García et al., 2022). The knowledge of the human microbiome has increased in recent years, due to the improvements in molecular techniques, and the development of new experimental designs and model systems (Rackaityte and Lynch, 2020).</p>
        <p>The most important human microbiome is the gut microbiota, a dynamic functional ecosystem that can spatially and/or temporally change depending on several host factors (Costello et al., 2009). Therefore, microbiome diversity is different depending on whether the microbial community is in a steady state (homeostasis or eubiosis) or a disturbed state (dysbiosis), and both these states can be defined by interactions among microorganisms and/or between the microorganisms and their host (Lloyd-Price et al., 2016;Lozupone et al., 2012;Lynch and Pedersen, 2016). In addition, microbial factors, like the production of antimicrobials and bacteriocins, as well as bacteriophage depredation mechanism, contribute to the function and composition shape of microbial gut communities (Das and Nair, 2019;Mills et al., 2013;Ruan et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Previous studies suggest that gut microbiota may modulate CNS development and function via immune, endocrine and neural pathways (Carabotti et al., 2015;Collins et al., 2012;Cryan et al., 2019;Erny et al., 2015;Fung et al., 2017;Martin et al., 2018). Furthermore, the gut microbiota may be critical in the establishment and development of certain psychiatric and psychological disorders (Cryan and Dinan, 2015;Cryan et al., 2020;Dinan and Cryan, 2017). Dysfunction in the gut-brain axis is considered to be a pathophysiology of mental disorders (Liang et al., 2018a); therefore, restoration of the disturbed microbial ecosystem provides a novel and promising approach for managing and/ or preventing these neurological disorders. At present, gut microbiome manipulation studies, both in animal models and humans, are focused on Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) therapy, and treatment with prebiotics (nutrients that stimulate the beneficial microbial growth), probiotics (microorganisms that confer a host-health benefit), or synbiotic (a combination of both) (Ansari et al., 2020;Barbosa and Vieira-Coelho, 2020;Kassam et al., 2013;Pandey et al., 2015). In this sense, Dinan et al. (2013) proposed the term "psychobiotics" to name those probiotics used in the treatment of different disorders, such as autism, anxiety, and depression. These agents regulate the gut microbiota and improve the microbiota-gut-brain communication (Berding and Standacher, 2022;Del Toro-Barbosa et al., 2020;Smith et al., 2021).</p>
        <p>An overview of the literature establishing the connection between the dysbiosis of the human gut microbiome and various psychiatric and psychological disorders was the aim of this review. In addition, we have provided knowledge of several interventions using psychobiotics that affect the gut microbiome to improve mental disorders. Finally, future directions for research and practice have also been suggested.</p>
        <p>A systematic search has been performed in accordance to the principles of the PRISMA guideline (Page et al., 2021a;2021b). PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were examined to access literature that matched our topics, from 2011 to 2023, with English-language restriction. The search strategy was built by using a combination of terms that matched the purpose of our investigation, whose primary focus is the link between human gut microbiota dysbiosis and various psychiatric and psychological disorders, as well as the effectiveness of several psychobiotic treatments on these mental disorders as secondary objective. The following keywords were used "[human gut microbiota] OR [dysbiosis]</p>
        <p>" with the filters "full text", "exclude preprints" and "humans". The search strategy was created by the first author and both authors independently conducted the searches. Titles and abstracts of potentially relevant articles were identified and screened. The search strategy also included examining reference lists from previous reviews and research papers (Identification of studies via other methods) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Both authors evaluated all suitable records considering the following inclusion criteria: (i) studies only on human subjects; (ii) open access studies that any other researchers can retrieve without any subscription; (iii) studies that analyzed the link between gut microbiota and the effects on several psychiatric and psychological disorders; (iv) studies on the effects of psychobiotics (probiotics and prebiotics) and FMT on neurological functions, as well as their influence on the human gut microbiota. As exclusion criteria were choosen the following: (i) meta-analysis, review and notes studies; (ii) studies related to physiological, self-immunity and virus diseases; (iii) studies based on endocrine disturbances or deficits; (iv) substance use disorders studies; (v) dietary habits studies. Supplementary Fig. 1 represents the PRISMA flow diagram for identifying, screening, and determining the eligibility and inclusion of studies selected for this review.</p>
        <p>The human gut tract contains a diverse microbial community, with a density of about 10 11 to 10 14 microbial cells per milliliter (Rinninella et al., 2019). However, almost 70% of microorganisms colonizing the gut cannot be cultured; therefore, molecular sequencing techniques must be applied to study this complex microbiome (Iizumi et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Gut microbiota is composed of several microbial taxa, including viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protozoa, with the most dominant being the Bacteria domain (Lloyd-Price et al., 2016). Low numbers of archaeal genera have been described in the healthy human gut microbiome, with Methanobrevibacter smithii as the most prevalent species (Horz, 2015). The most frequently detected eukaryotic microorganisms in the gut tract are fungi, such as Candida and Saccharomyces genera (Parfrey et al., 2014). These fungi maintain the ecological and immune gut microbiome equilibrium (Huffnagle and Noverr, 2013). Some protozoa, such as Blastocystis, have been detected in human gut microbiota and their presence has been frequently associated with a reduction of gastrointestinal disease (Scanlan et al., 2014). The human virome consists mostly of bacteriophages (Zarate et al., 2017), and their role in the gut is as modulators of the bacteriome (Mills et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>Bacteria are the most common microorganisms in the human gut, which are represented by about 100 species belonging to the following eight phyla: Actinomycetota (synonym Actinobacteria), Bacillota (synonym Firmicutes), Bacteroidota (synonym Bacteroidetes), Campylobacterota, Fusobacteriota (synonym Fusobacteria), Pseudomonadota (synonym Proteobacteria), Thermodesulfobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota (synonym Verrucomicrobia) (Arumugam et al., 2011;Lynch and Pedersen, 2016;Reynoso-García et al., 2022;Rinninella et al., 2019;Ruan et al., 2020). Fig. 1 shows the main phyla, families and genera described in the healthy human gut microbiota.</p>
        <p>There is a specific spatial distribution of the microorganisms in different intestinal compartments. The most dominant genera found in the upper gastrointestinal tract are Gemella, Veillonella, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Prevotella, Pseudomonas and Actinomyces; while in the lower gastrointestinal tract are Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Ruminococcus (Vasapolli et al., 2019). Gong et al. (2019) found that human duodenal mucosa was enriched in Bacillus, Solibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Exiguobacterium, Oceanobacillus and Paenibacillus. In the jejunum, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes are the most prevailing phyla, while Escherichia, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus were the most frequently detected genera (Sundin et al., 2017). Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, and Clostridium spp. are the most frequent species from the ileum (Zoetendal et al., 2012). The colon, an anaerobic environment, is dominated by Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, and the families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae (Arumugam et al., 2011), being the predominant identified bacteria genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium (Khan et al., 2014). James et al. (2020) studied the dominance of bacteria genera in different colon regions, and they found that in the sigmoid colon was Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus spp. in the proximal colon, and in the distal colon were Coprobacillus and Escherichia/Shigella. The appendix presents a high microbial diversity, with dominance of Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla; and Lachnospiraceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Fusobacteriaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae, at the family level (Guinane et al., 2013).</p>
        <p>Despite the human gut microbiota composition varies taxonomically and functionally due to factors such as age, nutrition, and antibiotic administration (Costello et al., 2009;Iizumi et al., 2017;Pérez-Cobas et al., 2013;Tanaka and Nakayama, 2017;Valdes et al., 2018;Yatsunenko et al., 2012), the predominant genera of the human gut microbiota are Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterococcus, Ruminicoccus, Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Blautia, Dorea and Eubacterium (phylum Bacillota); Bacteroides and Prevotella (phylum Bacteroidota); Bifidobacterium (phylum Actinomycetota); and Escherichia (phylum Pseudomonadota) (Das and Nair, 2019;Lloyd-Price et al., 2016;Rinninella et al., 2019) (Fig. 1).</p>
        <p>Gut microbiota provides positive effects for the human host, including immunological and metabolical functions (Brestoff and Artis, 2013;Rinninella et al., 2019). Intestinal microorganisms are key regulators of digestion, by means the absorption of nutrients, and by the synthesis of several metabolites, including lipids, amino acids, vitamins, and short-chain (2-6 C) fatty acids (SCFAs) (Hou et al., 2022;LeBlanc et al., 2013;Magnúsdóttir et al., 2015;Yin et al., 2019). Additionally, gut microbiota plays a critical function in preventing pathogenic bacteria infection through different competition processes (Khosravi and Mazmanian, 2013), and it also helps to maintain the intestinal epithelium integrity (Brestoff and Artis, 2013).</p>
        <p>The gut microbiota produces a wide range of secreted compounds from undigested foods (Rooke and Garrett, 2016;Ruan et al., 2020). One of them, namely quorum sensors, can act as signaling molecules for inter-bacterial communication, influencing bacterial regulation, homeostasis, growth, virulence and biofilm formation, to name a few (Das et al., 2020;Deng et al., 2020;Falà et al., 2022;Wu and Luo, 2021). Besides, bacteria may also secrete other biologically active compounds including tryptophan catabolites, SCFAs, polyamines, and histamine (Chimerel et al., 2014;Keszthelyi, 2023;Ruan et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>Metabolic products of tryptophane (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT], kynurenine and indole) are related to physiological and neuronal activities. Indole regulates the secretion of the incretin hormone (Chimerel et al., 2014), regulates gut barrier permeability (Bansal et al., 2010), and may serve as signaling molecule for intercellular communication between microorganisms and host cells (Lee and Lee, 2010). Moreover, indole and its derivatives have been described as inhibitory compounds of neuroinflammation (Rothhammer et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>The most quantitatively important metabolites are SCFAs, produced by the microbial degradation of indigestible dietary fibers, proteins, and glycoproteins (Wong et al., 2006). SCFAs, such as butyrate, acetate and propionate, may serve as signaling molecules that locally modulate the gut function from the duodenum to the colon, and through enteroendocrine cells they can also control the metabolism of the liver, muscle, and brain, influencing the host energetic homeostasis (Dalile et al., 2019;den Besten et al., 2013;Layden et al., 2013;Silva et al., 2020). In addition, SCFAs present neuroactive properties by the induction of neuroinflammatory responses (Foley et al., 2014). SCFAs are strong epigenetic modulators controlling the accessibility of genetic material for DNA methylation and inhibition of histone deacetylation (Wei et al., 2014). This mechanism is dependent on ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins, which catalyze the hydroxylation of cytosine residue into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine that mediate active DNA demethylation (Caspani et al., 2019). Kratsman et al. (2016) determined that butyrate induced changes in many behavior-related genes in the Fig. 1. Healthy human bacterial gut composition at the level of phyla (inner circle), families (middle circle) and genera (outer circle) (Arumugam et al., 2011;Lynch and Pedersen, 2016;Rinninella et al., 2019;Ruan et al., 2020;Reynoso-García et al., 2022).</p>
        <p>prefrontal cortex, and particularly affected genes involved in neuronal excitation or inhibition. The decrease in several excitatory neurotransmitter and neuronal activation marker genes, together with the increase in inhibitory neurotransmitter genes, suggests that butyrate promotes the transcription of inhibitory pathway transcripts.</p>
        <p>Recent studies have shown that bacterial metabolites can affect neural development (Wenzel et al., 2020;Yang et al., 2020). These last authors also reported that SCFAs affects the expression of neurogenesis genes. Rea et al. (2022), using a microbial-free zebrafish model, observed a significant decrease in neural gene expression in embryos raised microbial-free, which was re-established with the addition of zebrafish metabolites, identifying more than downregulated 300 genes. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these genes are involved in prominent neurodevelopmental pathways, including transcriptional regulation and Wnt signaling. In fact, Wnt signaling pathway plays a significant role in development and disease, and it can speculate that its regulation co-evolved with the bacterial colonization of multicellular eukaryotes.</p>
        <p>In Table 1 is displayed some of the key neurotransmitters synthesized by gut microbiota and their association with psychological and psychiatric disorders. These neuroactive compounds transmit information from the gut lumen to the enteric nervous system, enteric glia and CNS, through intrinsic and/or extrinsic afferent neural via (Bercik et al., 2011a;Lyte, 2013).</p>
        <p>AD is a neurodegenerative illness in which a progressive decline in cognitive and behavioral functions is associated with synaptic damage and neural loss, mainly in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Hayden and Teplow, 2013). Several studies have established a clear role of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ) in AD. Recent research suggests that bacterial-derived amyloids, such as curli, Csg A, tau, TasA, FapC and phenol soluble modulins, play a role in the aggregation and in promoting misfolding of Aβ oligomers (Kesika et al., 2021). Bacterial amyloid proteins activate the host immune system through interactions with the toll-like receptor TLR2, inducing pro-inflammatory mediators which provoke neuronal amyloid production in the brain (Cerovic et al., 2019). Other evidences suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with early stages of AD disease, leading to enhanced cytokine secretion, immuno-senescence, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (Leblhuber et al., 2020;Varesi et al., 2022). Moreover, gut microbial dysbiosis induces the secretion of LPS, which disrupts gastrointestinal permeability and the blood-brain barrier (BBB), modulating the inflammatory pathway that promotes neuroinflammation and cognitive decline, and leads to neuronal death in AD (Hu et al., 2016;Kesika et al., 2021;Varesi et al., 2022). In rats, peritoneal LPS administration resulted in increased levels of inflammatory factors, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α, suggesting a role of the microbiome in the initiation of an innate immune response in AD (Zhu et al., 2014). Zhao et al. (2017) found immunohistochemical evidence of microbiome-derived LPS within the perinuclear region of human AD brains. On the contrary, propionate (SCFA) appears to protect the BBB from damage via inhibiting oxidative stress thereby maintaining its integrity (Hoyles et al., 2018). Interestingly, Zhang et al. (2017) showed that the microbiota composition and diversity were perturbed and the level of SCFAs was reduced in AD mice, predicting alterations in more than 30 metabolic pathways, which may be associated with amyloid deposition. Intestinal dysbiosis may increase the TMAO concentration, which is implicated in different functions, such as β-amyloid formation, activation of peripheral immune responses and oxidative stress, and, in addition, in the increase of intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction, BBB permeability, and passage of bile acids and cholesterol into the brain (Gamba et al., 2012;Gao et al., 2019).</p>
        <p>Cattaneo et al. ( 2017) found an increased proportion of pro-inflammatory taxa such as Escherichia/Shigella in AD patients, and a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria such as Eubacterium rectale, E. hallii, F. prausnitzii and B. fragilis. These bacteria are associated with a peripheral inflammatory state, typical sign presented by patients affecting to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and brain amyloidosis. Vogt et al. (2017) reported that AD patients exhibited lower microbial diversity in their gut microbiota, with a decrease in Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium species and an increase in Bacteroidetes members. Furthermore, Zhuang et al. (2018) found an increase in Bacteroidetes bacterial members and a decrease in Actinobacteria at phyla level, as well as increased Ruminococcaceae, Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae, and reduced Lanchnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae and Veillonellaceae at the family level. An increase of pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa, and concomitantly a decrease in butyrate-producing bacteria such as Butyrivibrio (B. proteoclasticus and B. hungatei), Clostridium spp.,</p>
        <p>Relationships between producer-neurotransmitters gut microorganisms and mental disorders (according to Chen et al., 2021;Huang and Wu, 2021;Strandwitz, 2018). CNS: central nervous system; PNS: peripheral nervous system.</p>
        <p>Eubacterium (E. hallii, E. rectal and E. eligens), F. prausnitzii and R. hominis, were observed in AD patients (Haran et al., 2019). Additionally, Liu et al. (2019a) reported, in AD and MCI individuals, a significant decrease in Firmicutes and an increase in Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Enterobacteria abundance. Besides, these authors found a clear difference in Enterobacteriaceae load between MCI and AD patients, suggesting a change in the gut microbiota composition during disease progression (Varesi et al., 2022). In contrast, lower levels of Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Ruminiclostridium and Bacteroides, and higher levels of Bifidobacterium and Prevotella in AD and MCI patients were reported (Guo et al., 2021;Ling et al., 2021) (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>ASD is an early brain developmental disorder characterized by stereotyped behavior and deficits in communication and social interaction (Hodges et al., 2020). The precise pathology and etiology of ASD are difficult to identify, and research has focused on investigating genetic causes, immune system dysregulation, exposure to environmental toxicants, and alterations in the gut microbiota (Doenyas, 2018; Fakhoury, 2015; Mayer et al., 2014). Finegold et al. (2010) reported a higher gut microbial diversity in ASD children, with an increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum and a decrease in the Firmicutes phylum. On the opposite, Strati et al. (2017) reported a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in ASD subjects because of a reduction in the Bacteroidetes titers. The most prevalent genera in ASD samples were the following (Fig. 2): Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio, Collinsella, Corynebacterium, Dorea, Lactobacillus, Caloramator, Prevotella, Sutterella, Sarcina, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium and Megamonas; and a decrease in the presence of the genera Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Bilophila, Dialister, Parabacteroides, Veillonella, Akkermansia, Coprococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Clostridium, Eisenbergiella, Flavonifrector and Haemophilus (Finegold et al., 2010(Finegold et al., , 2012;;Grimaldi et al., 2018;Iglesias-Vázquez et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2017;Strati et al., 2017;Tomova et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2012;Zou et al., 2020). These findings strongly suggest a link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the behavioral manifestations of autism. Although the administration of butyrate improved ASD symptoms (Kratsman et al., 2016), there are contradictory results on the role of SCFAs in ASD (Liu et al., 2019b;Thomas et al., 2012;Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, a lower abundance of Bifidobacterium, which is key in the production of the GABA neurotransmitter, has been found in ASD patients, leading to anxiety, cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders (Garcia-Gutierrez et al., 2020) (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>The accumulation of neurotoxin-producing Clostridium difficile and C. histolyticum is associated with ASD symptoms (Sivamaruthi et al., 2020). These toxic molecules released affect serotonin signalling (Martin et al., 2018), potentially leading to ASD behavioral patterns such as decreased socialization, decreased response to pain, abnormal language, and self-abusive or repetitive behaviors (Ding et al., 2017;Fattorusso et al., 2019;Mohamadkhani, 2018). ASD-affected individuals show altered levels of other potentially toxic compounds, like p-cresol and pcresylsulfate, that inhibit the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (Roman et al., 2018). Additionally, increased Clostridia-derived metabolite 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxy propionic acid has been detected in ASD-affected individuals, potentially reflecting an altered catecholamine metabolism (Xiong et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>The role of SCFAs in ASD is still controversial, since propionate induces microglia activation, neurotoxic cytokine production, genetic expression alterations, abnormal hippocampal histology, and abnormal neurobehaviors, such as repetitive actions and impaired social interaction (Choi et al., 2018); however, butyrate possesses a beneficial effect on social and repetitive behavior in the BTBR mouse model, a strainbased ASD-like model (Kratsman et al., 2016). Improvement of BBB impermeability by butyrate may be another mechanism through which butyrate can revert abnormalities in propionate-induced autism-like disorder (Downs et al., 2014).</p>
        <p>PD is a degenerative affliction, prevalent among the elderly, which presents as major disease signs the neuroinflammation, loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and motor symptoms (Cenit et al., 2017;Liddle, 2018;O'Toole and Jeffery, 2015). Several authors have suggested that dysbiotic microbiota-induced inflammatory responses could contribute to the development or worsening of PD pathology. These responses could promote LPS and α-synuclein accumulation in the intestine and the brain, and spreading of α-synuclein pathology from the rostral to caudal regions through vagal via, due to increased oxidative stress resulting from the pro-inflammatory bacteria activity (Forsyth et al., 2011;Hopfner et al., 2017;Perez-Pardo et al., 2017;Sampson et al., 2016). On the other hand, microbial SCFAs prevent the increase of intestinal mucosal permeability to reduce bacterial translocation (Canani et al., 2011). In PD there is a significant decrease in SCFAs; conversely, SCFAs promote α-synuclein accumulation and aggravate PD motor symptoms in murine models (Sampson et al., 2016). The involvement of SCFAs in PD pathology has not been elucidated completely, since Unger et al. (2016) reported that the depletion of SCFAs induced the formation of Lewy bodies in the ENS; on the contrary, Shin et al. (2020) suggested that SCFAs were able of decreasing blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. These findings support the hypothesis that SCFAs deficiencies may be a causal origin of PD, considering their involvement in neuroinflammation and microglial activation, as well as gastrointestinal features such as constipation, gut leakiness and colonic inflammation (Zheng et al., 2021a).</p>
        <p>PD patients frequently present increased levels of certain bacterial species belonging to families Lactobacillaceae, Barnesiellaceae and Enterococcaceae (Hill-Burns et al., 2017;Hopfner et al., 2017;Keshavarzian et al., 2015). In addition, Scheperjans et al. (2015) confirmed an important reduction in the levels of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria (family Prevotellaceae, genera Blautia, Coprococcus and Roseburia), as well as the genus Faecalibacterium in feces and mucosa of PD patients. Moreover, pro-inflammatory bacteria like Ralstonia were more abundant in PD patient intestinal mucosa. On the basis of the positive correlation between the Enterobacteriaceae titers and the severity of PD symptoms, these authors suggested the gut microbiota may be involved in the PD phenotype. Regarding to the lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in PD fecal samples, several authors have suggested that a reduction in SCFAs may contribute to gut leakiness (Keshavarzian et al., 2015;Sampson et al., 2016). Interestingly, Li et al. (2017a) found a decrease in the cellulose-degrading bacteria belonging to the genera Blautia, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus in PD gut microbiota; whilst an increase of the pathobionts Proteus, Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus and Enterococcus were also observed (Fig. 2). Correlation analysis showed a negative relationship between disease severity and duration of PD and cellulose degraders, but a positive correlation with pathobionts, potentially leading to reduced production of SCFAs and increased neurotoxins and endotoxins, may be associated with the development of PD pathology (Li et al., 2017b). Furthermore, decreased abundance of Prevotellaceae and an increased abundance of Lactobacillaceae have been associated with lower concentrations of ghrelin, a gut hormone related to the maintenance of normal dopamine function, and altered ghrelin secretion is present in PD patients (Unger et al., 2011) (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder in which the patients interpret reality abnormally, and certain aversive symptoms are frequently presented (Owen et al., 2016). The origin of this disease is controversial, suggesting a hereditary nature (Fabi et al., 2013;Munawar et al., 2021). However, it is important to note the role that several environmental factors may play in its predisposition and the development of this disease, through epigenetic mechanisms, such as the neurotransmission genes methylation, nucleotide modifications, or the action of non-coding RNAs (Munawar et al., 2021;van Os et al., 2010).</p>
        <p>Although there are no confirmed results establishing a direct relationship between the gut microbiome and schizophrenia (Nemani et al., 2015), several facts suggest an indirect link. Thus, differences in SCFAs, tryptophan catabolites and neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate and nitric oxide), are known as schizophrenia-associated gut-brain modules (Valles-Colomer et al., 2019). Dopamine produced by microorganisms is related to schizophrenia, and the increased gastrointestinal inflammation associated with schizophrenia strongly suggest that gut microbiota may play a role in the risk of developing schizophrenia or its manifestations (Cuomo et al., 2018;Dinan et al., 2014;Rodrigues-Amorim et al., 2018). For instance, Dickerson et al. (2017) showed a direct relationship between the gut microbiota dybiosis provoked by antibiotic treatment and the incidence of schizophrenia. Later, Shen et al. (2018) found a significant increase in the abundance of genera Megasphaera, Succinivibrio, Clostridium, Collinsella, Methanobrevibacter and Klebsiella in the schizophrenic patients, while a decrease of the titers of Blautia, Coprococcus and Roseburia was observed in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>Several studies have established the connection between antipsychotic drug treatment and gut microbiota. Schizophrenia patients revealed significant alterations in abundance of microbiota species followed to an antipsychotic treatment (Yuan et al., 2018). In other study, Bahr et al. (2015) reported that antipsychotic-treated patients presented a gradual increase in Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, correlating with a rise in body mass index. Additionally, the gut microbiome of treated individuals was enriched with genes for SCFAs and serotonin metabolism.</p>
        <p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by high levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity and attention problems. The exact mechanisms involved in this disorder are still unknown, although may be involved both environmental and genetic factors (Thapar et al., 2013). In addition, several evidences suggest that ADHD development or symptoms may be related to the modulation of gut microbiome exerted by dietary components (Cenit et al., 2017;Sandgren and Brummer, 2018).</p>
        <p>In last years, several studies have been carried out on gut microbiota of ADHD with contradictory results (Sukmajaya et al., 2021). Aarts et al. (2017) established that Bifidobacterium and Eggerthella genera were the predominant gut microbiota of ADHD. However, decrease in the levels of Faecalibacterium, Dialister, Sutterella and Lachnosclostridium genera was reported by Jiang et al. (2018), and the genera Haemophilus and Phascolartobacterium in ADHD-gut microbiota was found by Szopinska-Tokov et al. (2020). Increase in Neisseria and decrease in Prevotella levels was found by Prehn-Kristensen et al. ( 2018), whilts Wang et al. (2020) reported that Bacteroides decrease in ADHD and the increase genus was Fusobacterium. Wan et al. (2020) found decrease in the levels of Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus, and increase in Odoribacter, Enterococcus, Paraprevotella, Veillonella and Roseburia genera (Fig. 2).</p>
        <p>More recently, Jung et al. (2022) found that ADHD children with a processed diet showed significantly higher abundance of harmful bacteria, such as the Enterobacter, E. coli and Clostridium strains, and markedly lower abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as the Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains. Processed food and ADHD groups showed significantly lower α-diversity of gut microbiota and SCFAs levels than the control group, concluding that imbalanced diets can disturb the colonic microbial balance and are likely to become a potential risk factor for the prevalence of ADHD.</p>
        <p>The host-microbiome interactions possess effects on hormones and neurotransmitter levels thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD (Bull-Larsen and Mohajeri, 2019; Wan et al., 2020). Gut dysbiosis in combination with immune dysfunction caused by constant microbial pathogen exposure could contribute to hyperactive behaviors observed in affected-ADHD patients (Ming et al., 2018). ADHD has been associated with abnormalities in the predicted dopamine and noradrenaline synthesis, whose precursors are provided by the gut bacteria, mainly Bifidobacterium (Aarts et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Stress is defined as a state of worry or tension which may become excessive and persistent, and that is caused by an adverse situation or by an environmental stressor (Koolhaas et al., 2011). Stress responses are associated with psychological and biological factors such as sex hormones, high emotional reactivity, passive coping skills, glucocorticoid resistance, and central and peripheral immune activation (Franklin et al., 2012;Halbreich, 2021;Pfau and Russo, 2015;Sasso et al., 2023).</p>
        <p>Different types of psychological and social stressors have been shown</p>
        <p>to modulate the composition and activity of the enteric microbiota by the release, from neurons, immune cells and enterocromaffin cells, of signaling molecules, hormones or neurotransmitters (Bharwani et al., 2016;Collins et al., 2012;Cryan et al., 2019;Galley et al., 2014;Gur et al., 2015;Liang et al., 2015;Partrick et al., 2018). The effect of stress on gut microbiota may be mediated both directly via host-enteric microbiota signaling and indirectly via changes in the intestinal ecosystem (De Palma et al., 2014;Scriven et al., 2018), and involves inflammatory response, alterations in microbial habitat, intestinal motility and mucin secretion (Collins et al., 2012;Carabotti et al., 2015;Liu et al., 2017). Bailey et al. (2011), applying an animal model of social disruption, demonstrated that exposure to stress leads to substantial changes in gut microbiota composition with a decrease in Bacteroides spp. and an increase in Clostridium spp. (Fig. 3). Stress provoked by long-term life difficulties has been associated with an increase in Enterobacteriaceae, whereas a reduction in Lactobacillus spp., and an increase in E. coli and Pseudomonas spp., have been reported in psychological stress (Bhattarai et al., 2017). Certain microbiota may be involved in stress-derived anxiety and general anxiety disorder (GAD), which is characterized by a decreased social and occupational function (Bear et al., 2021;Lyte et al., 2006). Jiang et al. (2018) reported a lower prevalence of Faecalibacterium, E. rectale, Lachnospira, Butyricicoccus and Sutterella in patients with GAD, all of which are important producers of SCFAs. This decrease in SCFAsproducer bacteria is the key to the monoamine hypothesis for anxiety and depression (Liu et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>Depression is a mood-related disorder that involves neuroimmuneneuroendocrine dysregulation and is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which activate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, potentially accentuating its hyperactivation (Chopra et al., 2011;Kelly et al., 2016;Liang et al., 2018b). Proinflammatory cytokines, linked to high levels of cortisol, play an important role by inhibiting the enzyme tetrahydrobiopterin, which is essential for synthesizing dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (Miller and Raison, 2016). Therefore, both elevated cortisol and a proinflammatory state may lead to increased intestinal permeability and neuroinflammation (Winter et al., 2018). In mouse models, the microbiome profile associated with depressive symptoms has been related to changes in both microbial genes and gut metabolism (Rogers et al., 2016;Zheng et al., 2016). On the other hand, neuroinflammatory changes provoked by microbial metabolites affect synaptic and nonsynaptic plasticity in basolateral amygdala projection neurons and are associated with anxiety--related behavior (Zheng et al., 2021b).</p>
        <p>There are certain pieces of evidence suggesting the relationship between gut microbiota and depression modulation (Dinan and Cryan, 2013;Huang and Wu, 2021). The absence of microbiota has been shown to reduce depressive-like behavior (Foster and McVey Neufeld, 2013;Zheng et al., 2016). Moreover, studies showed FMT of microbiotadepleted animals with microbiota derived from MDD patients resulted in the transfer of depression-like behavioral and physiological features, supporting a causal relationship between dysbiotic microbiota and depression (Kelly et al., 2016;Knudsen et al., 2021;Zheng et al., 2016). Several studies have reported that gut microbiota composition varied widely in depressed patients. For instance, Naseribafrouei et al. (2014) found higher titers of bacteria of the order Bacteroidales and decreased levels of members belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae. Jiang et al. (2015) reported that the increase in fecal microbial diversity was negatively correlated with the severity of depressive MDD symptoms. These authors found that the genera Gelria, Turicibacter, Anaerofilum, Paraprevotella, Holdemania and Eggerthella were prevalent, whereas reductions in the presence of Prevotella and Dialister were detected in depressed individuals. Later, Aizawa et al. (2016) found that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus were reduced in the gut microbiota of depressed individuals compared to control subjects. A significant decrease in the genera Dorea, Ruminococcus and Akkermansia, and an increase in Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Actinobacteria were associated with depressed individuals (McGaughey et al., 2019). In a cohort study, Valles-Colomer et al. (2019) found an overall reduction in microbial load, and included the depressed or lower life quality individuals in an enterotype with lower abundance of the genera Faecalibacterium, Dialister and Coprococcus. More recently, Knuesel and Mohajeri (2021) found in depressed subjects an important decrease in the intestinal microbiota diversity, consistent in the increase of bacteria of the family Bifidobacteriaceae and the genus Bacteroides, and in the reduction of the members of the family Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia (Fig. 3).</p>
        <p>Several studies have shown a depletion of butyrate, acetate and propionate in MDD patients (Jiang et al., 2015;Skonieczna-Żydecka et al., 2018;Zheng et al., 2016), suggesting that SCFAs may alter behavior by direct stimulation of neural pathways, or through the indirect central effect of neuroendocrine and immune activation (Caspani et al., 2019). SCFAs also contribute to the synthesis and release of peripheral neurotransmitters (5-HT and acetylcholine) by enterochromaffin cells and norepinephrine by sympathetic neurons (López Soto et al., 2014). In addition to their local action, SCFAs can act directly on central receptors across the BBB (Vijay and Morris, 2014). Moreover, in vitro studies show both propionate and butyrate, but not acetate, can modulate the permeability of the BBB, protecting against the increased permeability caused by LPS (Hoyles et al., 2018).</p>
        <p>OCD is a chronic and long-lasting disorder in which intrusive thoughts, ego dystonic ideas, obsessional impulses and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) occur (Stein et al., 2019). Although only a few studies have been performed on the involvement of the gut microbiota in OCD (Turna et al., 2016), stress and antibiotic treatment, both affecting microbiota composition, have been proposed as factors coinciding with the onset of OCD symptoms (Rees, 2014). Turna et al. (2020) reported that individuals with OCD presented lower species richness of the gut microbiota and lower relative abundance of butyrate-producing genera (genera Oscillospira, Odoribacter and Anaerostipes). Recently, Domènech et al. (2022) reported that OCD stool samples showed an increase in the abundance of Rikenellaceae (genus Alistipes), and a lower abundance of Prevotellaceae and Lachnospiraceae (genera Agathobacter and Coprococcus) (Fig. 3).</p>
        <p>The amygdala, which plays a pivotal role in stress-related mood, behavior response and emotion regulation, is notably affected by the gut microbiota (Cowan et al., 2017;Hoban et al., 2017;Morelli et al., 2016). In animal models, there are several evidences supporting that changes in the gut microbiota composition can influence in modulating cognitive function, although only a few studies have been focused on human cognition. Fernandez-Real et al. (2015) studied the gut microbiota composition of obese and non-obese subjects, establishing that the microbiota composition affects the cognitive performance of individuals. More recently, Carlson et al. (2018) established three groups of subjects based on the abundance of Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae, and concluded that better cognitive performance corresponded to the group with higher levels of Bacteroides. Depriving or disrupting the gut microbiota with antibiotic treatment can also affect cognitive functions, including verbal learning capacity and working and spatial memory (Gareau, 2016;Manderino et al., 2017;Tooley, 2020).</p>
        <p>A relationship between personality and gut microbiota is very difficult to establish, due to the strong association between personality traits and behavioral patterns, as well as physiological and psychological health outcomes (Ferguson, 2013;Srivastava and Das, 2015). However, several studies have demonstrated an association between gut microbiota and temperament and character on the basis that these traits can even be transmitted among subjects through FMT (Collins et al., 2013;Kelly et al., 2016;Kim et al., 2018;Zheng et al., 2016). Christian et al. (2015), examining the relationship between the shape of the gut microbiome and the child's temperament, found that greater surgency/ extraversion and fear were positively associated with phylogenetic diversity, including changes in the abundance of Dialister, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Parabacteroides. Among adults, high neuroticism and low conscientiousness were found to be associated with the high abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and Proteobacteria, respectively. On the other hand, high conscientiousness was associated with an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria titers, mainly belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae (Kim et al., 2017). Kim et al. (2018) found that high neuroticism and low extraversion were associated with an increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria. Otherwise, low conscientiousness was linked to an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and a decreased abundance of Lachnospiraceae, while those with high levels of openness were correlated with greater phylogenic diversity and richness. More recently, Johnson (2020) showed that the abundance of specific bacterial genera is significantly associated with personality traits. The analysis of gut microbiome diversity revealed that individuals with higher social networks presented a diverse gut microbiome, while anxiety and stress were related to altered composition and reduced diversity of the gut microbiome. The study also found that certain bacterial genera, including Akkermansia, Desulfovibrio, Lactococcus, Oscillospira and Sutterella may be more strongly associated with behavior.</p>
        <p>Several methods have been used to determine the role of gut microbiota on CNS functioning, including antibiotic treatment, germfree animal models, and FMT. In addition, psychobiotics and prebiotics have been used as adjunct therapy in psychiatric and psychological disorders (Cepeda et al., 2017;Huang et al., 2016;Ligezka et al., 2021;Ng et al., 2019;Pirbaglou et al., 2016;Wallace and Milev, 2017). The category of psychobiotics can be defined as "a live organism that confers mental health benefits in patients suffering from psychiatric illness through interaction with commensal gut bacteria" (Smith et al., 2021). These agents exert their effects by regulating and improving the gut microbiota (Berding and Standacher, 2022;Del Toro-Barbosa et al., 2020). A review of different interventions using probiotic or prebiotic treatments is shown in Table 2.</p>
        <p>The etiology and molecular mechanism of psychiatric disorders is still unclear now, although biological, psychological and environmental factors all contribute to the occurrence and development of psychiatric disorders (Arango et al., 2018). Several studies have reported that host genetic variations may produce changes in the gut microbiota composition and diversity (Bonder et al., 2016;Dubois et al., 2019;Goodrich et al., 2014;2016). In addition, similar genetic mechanisms that modulate gut microbiota have been involved in the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, ASD, ADHD and MDD (Martins-Silva et al., 2021). Although more efforts exploring microbiome genome-wide association studies and their relationship with psychiatric disorders are needed, the following pathways have been suggested: alterations in hormone binding, lipid metabolism, the immune system, and neuronal response (Lim et al., 2017;Martins-Silva et al., 2021). Cheng et al. (2020), using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), were able to detect the following significant associations between gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders: ADHD with Desulfovibrio and order Clostridiales; for ASD association with Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio; for MDD association was observed for Desulfovibrio, order Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroides; and genera Desulfovibrio and Bacteroides appeared to be associated with schizophrenia. More recently, specific associations between Prevotellaceae and ASD, and Actinobacteria with schizophrenia were reported by Ni et al. (2022). Similarly, a relationship between Actinobacteria and Pseudomonadales with MDD was suggested by Han et al. (2023).</p>
        <p>The gut-brain crosstalk is a bidirectional communication system that ensures optimal gut homeostasis, and allows signals from the gut microbiota to influence brain development and function. Gut microbiota and the CNS communicate through two routes: (i) neuro-immune and metabolic circuits via the vagal pathway; and (ii) microbiotasynthesized metabolites, gut hormones and endocrine peptides. Moreover, the presence of numerous confounding variables in these studies makes it challenging to establish a clear cause-effect relationship between gut microbiota and mental/psychological disorders. Nevertheless, previous studies have demonstrated that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is a pathophysiology of several mental disorders. Therefore, restoring the disturbed microbial ecosystem may provide a novel and promising approach for managing and/or preventing neurological disorders.</p>
        <p>Conventional treatment for psychiatric diseases, involving pharmacological treatment with second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs, possesses side effects such as microbiome dysbiosis and significant weight gain of patients. One aspect not yet studied in depth is whether certain microbes can influence the therapeutic efficacy of SGA treatment or microbial gut compositions may play antipsychotic roles, thereby improving the efficacy of SGA treatment. On the other hand, psychological interventions have demonstrated efficacy in treating functional gastrointestinal disorders like IBS; however, further research is needed to determine if psychological interventions can induce changes in the gut microbiota. The reconstitution of the gut microbiota dysbiosis through interventions such as FMT, healthy diet, healthy lifestyle or the use of psychobiotics may hold significant potential in regulating the function of the microbiota-gut-brain axis function and promoting mental health in the future.</p>
        <p>In particular, psychobiotic interventions may have potential therapeutic utility for certain neurological disorders. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is not universal and depends on factors such as the administration method, timing of intervention, the number and specific type of microbial strains used, and the physiological status of the host. In the future, personalized psychobiotic interventions, either alone or in combination with antipsychotics (Precision Psychiatry), may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for clinical patients. However, further efforts are needed to establish the optimal psychobiotic intervention approach.</p>
        <p>Clinical trials involving human participants are essential for advancing knowledge and facilitating practical applications. Research on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has significant practical implications and provides a more holistic approach to the prevention and treatment of psychological illnesses. However, the specific factors and precise mechanisms that influence communication within the gut microbiota-CNS axis remain unresolved.</p>
