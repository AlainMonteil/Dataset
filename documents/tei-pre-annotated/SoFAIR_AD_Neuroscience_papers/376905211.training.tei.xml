        <p>The GWAS data were derived from participants of predominantly European ancestry included in the population-based UK Biobank and Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research studies: approximately 54% of the initial UK Biobank sample and 55.6% of the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research sample selected for the ASRD GWAS were women. In a combined sample size of 737 473 study participants, single-variable MR showed that genetic liability for increased prescription opioid use was associated with increased risk of both MDD (odds ratio [OR] per unit increase in log odds opioid use, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22; P &lt; .001) and ASRD (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.44; P = .004). Using multivariable MR, these opioid use estimates remained after accounting for other nonopioid pain medications (MDD OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25; P = .005; ASRD OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-1.46; P = .006), and in separate models, accounting for comorbid pain conditions. Bidirectional analyses showed that genetic liability for MDD but not ASRD was associated with increased prescription opioid use risk (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08-1.30; P &lt; .001). These estimates were generally consistent across single-variable and multivariable inverse variance-weighted (MV-IVW) and MR-Egger sensitivity analyses.

        <p>T he United States is in the middle of an opioid epidemic, 1 with an approximately 5-fold increase in opioid prescription use over the past 20 years resulting in large increases in opioid misuse. 2 Opioid-related deaths are rapidly increasing, and approximately 68% of the 702 000 drug overdose deaths in the United States from 2013 to 2017 involved opioids. 3,4 It is also reported that prescription opioids (vs illicit opioids) are the first opioids to be misused, 5 with almost 30% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misusing them 6 and about 12% developing opioid use disorder (OUD). 6 Informed prescribing practices require comprehensive understanding of the treatment's risks and benefits, and while opioids alleviate pain, chronic use is associated with numerous adverse effects, including immunosuppression, natural reward processes dysregulation, and neurohormonal deficits. 7,8 Observational studies have also found opioid use to be highly comorbid with both major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety and stress-related disorders (ASRD). [9][10][11][12] It is estimated that the approximately 7.8 million adults with psychiatric disorders (primarily MDD and ASRD) receive more than half of the almost 200 million yearly opioid prescriptions. 10 Compared with other patient populations, individuals with psychiatric disorders are also more likely to report long-term opioid use. [13][14][15] Because MDD and ASRD are leading global causes of disability and death, 16,17 elucidating the direction and potentially causal effect of these associations would be useful to inform prevention strategies. Literature suggests prescription opioid use increases MDD risk, [18][19][20][21] and while observational findings suggest a potential association between prescription opioid use, MDD, and ASRD, observational data are subject to confounding and reverse causation, making causal inference difficult. 22,23 Therefore it remains to be elucidated whether MDD is a cause or consequence of prescription opioid use. 18 While prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the criterion standard of causal inference, 24 performing RCTs to evaluate the effects of prescription opioid use or other nonopioid pain medications is often complicated by preexisting psychiatric comorbidities.T he United States is in the middle of an opioid epidemic, 1 with an approximately 5-fold increase in opioid prescription use over the past 20 years resulting in large increases in opioid misuse. 2 Opioid-related deaths are rapidly increasing, and approximately 68% of the 702 000 drug overdose deaths in the United States from 2013 to 2017 involved opioids. 3,4 It is also reported that prescription opioids (vs illicit opioids) are the first opioids to be misused, 5 with almost 30% of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misusing them 6 and about 12% developing opioid use disorder (OUD). 6 Informed prescribing practices require comprehensive understanding of the treatment's risks and benefits, and while opioids alleviate pain, chronic use is associated with numerous adverse effects, including immunosuppression, natural reward processes dysregulation, and neurohormonal deficits. 7,8 Observational studies have also found opioid use to be highly comorbid with both major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety and stress-related disorders (ASRD).

        <p>Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) as unconfounded proxies for exposures to estimate their effect on outcomes of interest, minimizes the bias affecting observational epidemiologic studies. 23,[25][26][27] Conceptually, MR has analogies with RCTs, with randomization occurring at meiosis, 23,26 and is an important strategy for strengthening causal inference when RCTs are impractical or unethical. 23 Given the public health importance of assessing the possible bidirectional associations between prescription opioid use and neuropsychiatric disorders, gaining causal inference into these associations would be important to aid prevention strategies.Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) as unconfounded proxies for exposures to estimate their effect on outcomes of interest, minimizes the bias affecting observational epidemiologic studies. 23,[25][26][27] Conceptually, MR has analogies with RCTs, with randomization occurring at meiosis, 23,26 and is an important strategy for strengthening causal inference when RCTs are impractical or unethical. 23 Given the public health importance of assessing the possible bidirectional associations between prescription opioid use and neuropsychiatric disorders, gaining causal inference into these associations would be important to aid prevention strategies.</p>

        <p>Participant overlap in samples used to estimate genetic associations between exposures and outcomes can increase weak instrument bias in MR analyses. 36,37 We avoided overlap in our analyses of pain medication use on MDD and ASRD: we used meta-analytic results for MDD that excluded the UKB cohort (n = 29 740). To improve precision for the bidirectional analyses of MDD on pain medication use, we used meta-analytic results for MDD including additional cohorts from 23andMe (n = 307 354) and UKB (overall n = 480 359). Hence, sample overlap (for bidirectional analyses) was minimal (6.2%), and because MDD instrument strength was considered strong (F statistic of approximately 32, see subsequent text), considerable weak instrument bias is not expected. 37Participant overlap in samples used to estimate genetic associations between exposures and outcomes can increase weak instrument bias in MR analyses. 36,37 We avoided overlap in our analyses of pain medication use on MDD and ASRD: we used meta-analytic results for MDD that excluded the UKB cohort (n = 29 740).

            <rs type="software">R</rs> packages (
            <rs type="creator">The R Foundation</rs>). We selected all relevant SNVs identified in each GWASs as having reached selection threshold P less than 5 × 10 -6 and being uncorrelated (10 000 kilobase pairs apart and R 2 ≤.001). We obtained SNV effects and corresponding standard errors from the exposure and outcome GWASs. 38 We harmonized exposure and outcome data, removed palindromic SNVs with intermediate allele frequencies, and estimated the F parameter to evaluate instrument strength. 37 We applied Steiger filtering to the harmonized data to identify and remove those SNVs exhibiting reverse causation by the test metric. The observed variance of the outcome exceeded the observed variance of the exposure explained by the SNVs (eTables 3-8 in the Supplement: harmonized data sets). 39 For single-variable MR analysis, we used inverse varianceweighted (IVW) MR as the primary method. However, because this method gives consistent estimates only if all genetic variants are valid instrumental variables (IVs), we considered complementary MR-Egger and weighted medianbased regression methods, which make different IV assumptions, as a sensitivity analysis to address the question of robustness of our IVW estimate. 23,38,40 The MR-Egger regression gives consistent estimates when 100% of genetic variants are invalid IVs; weighted median requires 50% of the weight to come from valid IVs. However, regarding efficiency, weighted median estimates generally are nearly as precise as IVW estimates; both are substantially more precise than MR-Egger estimates, with MR-Egger regression estimates particularly imprecise if all IVs have similar magnitudes of association with the exposure. 41 We used the MR-Egger intercept test, 42 Cochran Q heterogeneity test, 43 and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test 44 to evaluate potential IV violations. We also performed leave-one-out analyses to detect high influence points. 39 For MVMR analyses, we constructed instruments using SNVs in each of the GWASs meeting our single-variable MR selection criteria, described previously. We used the MVMR extension of the inverse-variance weighted MR method 36 and MR-Egger method to correct for both measured and unmeasured pleiotropy. 45 We combined the SNVs from the relevant GWASs: prescription opioid plus nonprescription pain medications; prescription opioid plus each of the chronic pain conditions; and the bidirectional MDD plus ASRD instrument. We removed duplicate and correlated SNVs (within 10 000 kilobase pairs; R 2 ≥0.001), then extracted the SNV effects and corresponding standard e r r o r s f r o m t h e e x p o s u r e s a n d o u t c o m e G WA S s (eTables 9-14 in the Supplement: harmonized data sets).

        <p>In MVMR, assessing the genetic liabilities for prescription opioid and nonopioid pain medications use jointly, opioid use retained a robust relationship with both MDD (IVW OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25; P = .005) and ASRD (IVW OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08-1.56; P = .006) (Table 2; eTable 19 in the Supplement).

        <p>The underlying mechanisms of prescription opioids in the pathophysiology of MDD remain to be elucidated, but potentially include opioid-induced dysregulation of reward circuitry that results in reduced reward perception or pleasure and relief generation 49 or other physical medical dysregulation (ie, endoc rine and autonomic ner vous system abnormalities 50 ) that potentially contributes to the physical symptoms of MDD.

        <p>tion of mood and the dysregulation of that system may factor into depression and anxiety 11,51,52 ; μ-opioid receptors (MOR) are widely distributed within the brain, including regions involved in emotion regulation, 11 and κ-opioid receptors (KOR) are expressed in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus, 53 suggesting a role in reward, pain, and emotion. Opioid receptor antagonism has also been shown to attenuate ketamine's antidepressant effects, 54 and subeuphoric doses of partial opioid agonists have been shown to improve MDD symptoms. 11 However, while small opioid doses may improve mood by activating MORs, prolonged opioid use may saturate MORs and activate the KOR, which also modulate mood 55,56 and are associated with depression 54,57 ; in rodents, KOR agonists increase anxiety while deficiencies in the KOR system decrease anxiety. 51 In humans, prolonged opioid use (30 days or more), which may saturate the opioid receptor system to affect mood, 54 increased risk for developing treatment-resistant depression by more than 25%, compared with opioid use for less than 30 days. 21 Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the opioid system dysregulation potentially shared between MDD and OUD may be important to combat these crises. 11 Our bidirectional analyses, with genetic liability for prescription opioid use as an outcome, point to genetic liability for MDD but not ASRD as a possible causal risk factor of opioid use in psychiatric populations. Depression severity has been shown to be associated with increasing likelihood of misusing opioid medications for nonpain symptoms and selfincreasing opioid dosage 58 and up to 30% of long-term opioid users who have MDD qualify for moderate-to-severe OUD, 15,59 suggesting that targeting opioid use prevention for patients with MDD may help mitigate the US opioid epidemic. 1,10 Given more than half of individuals with OUD have comorbid MDD, 10 the increased use of opioids by individuals with MDD may be owing to self-medication of social or emotional pain, 11 suggesting that the development of thera-peutic interventions with minimal risk targeted at endogenous opioid dysregulation represents another important prevention opportunity. 1 1 In sum, our findings support recommendations that caution is needed with prescribing in settings of mood disorders in favor of nonopioid alternatives, with screening for MDD prior to initiating opioid treatment. 10 Further, our findings that the genetic liability for MDD increased the risk of the genetic liability to take NSAIDs, anilide, and salicylic acid and derivatives support the wellknown association between depression and physical pain; comorbid depression and pain experience reduce physical, mental, and social functioning when beyond either depression or pain. 60 Further still, our findings that genetic liability for NSAIDs use increased the risk for MDD and ASRD supports observational evidence suggesting NSAIDs have adverse neural effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, 61,62 although the association direction is opposite to reported RCTs using NSAIDs as adjunct therapies for depression. 63 The NSAIDrelated adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms are most often reported with indomethacin and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, which may modulate neural processes and synaptic signaling processes where cyclooxygenase-2 is localized. 61tion of mood and the dysregulation of that system may factor into depression and anxiety 11,51,52 ; μ-opioid receptors (MOR) are widely distributed within the brain, including regions involved in emotion regulation, 11 and κ-opioid receptors (KOR) are expressed in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus, 53 suggesting a role in reward, pain, and emotion.

        <p>This innovative 2-sample MR study investigating the association between genetic liability for opioid and other pain medication use and neuropsychiatric outcomes has several strengths. We use summary genetic associations from the largest available GWASs, important genetic analyses investigating small effect sizes; generally, larger sample sizes increase measurement precision. We also use complementary 2-sample MR methods for sensitivity analysis. 64 The MVMR models are a major strength, enabling us to account for potential confounding owing to chronic pain, and also to estimate the direct association for genetic liability for prescription opioid use. Relatedly, including nonopioid pain medications provided additional context to the prescription opioid findings because none of the nonopioid pain medications retained a direct association with our neuropsychiatric outcomes in MVMR analyses. Finally, the list of prescribed prescription opioids comprising our opioid variable excludes heroin and other illicit opioid substances, enabling us to evaluate the specific association between the genetic liability for prescribed opioids and MDD. There are also limitations to this study. The pain medication use and psychiatric disorder SNV effect estimates were obtained in mostly European studies, thus minimizing the possibility of population stratification bias and increasing the plausibility of the 2-sample MR assumption that summary associations derived from comparable populations. 39,65 We performed sensitivity analyses to assess and minimize heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Nonetheless, we emphasize the importance of triangulating multiple lines of experimental evidence to strengthen causal inference. 66 Regarding genetic instrument selection, following the example of prior MR studies, 67,68 we used a stringent selection threshold (P &lt; 5 × 10 -6 ) for the pain medication use and ASRD risk instruments to compensate for lack of SNVs with effect P values less than conventional genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 × 10 -8 ). We also used stringent LD clumping thresholds to ensure instrument independence. The biologic mechanisms of the selected SNVs are unknown; however, sensitivity analyses failed to find evidence for horizontal pleiotropy.This innovative 2-sample MR study investigating the association between genetic liability for opioid and other pain medication use and neuropsychiatric outcomes has several strengths.

        <p>Further, each pain medication phenotype was a binary variable (use/nonuse), so we could not assess potential dosedependent changes in risk associated with prescription opioid use. Also, the genetic variants for pain medication use may be related to underlying disease, pain conditions, or even subclinical levels of the traits that influence MDD risk, 28 which may affect results, although we note the association of the genetic liability of opioid use found in single-variable MR persisted in MVMR accounting for genetic liability for site-specific chronic pain. Nonetheless, future genetic studies using detailed hospital-based information about pain medication and including negative control populations would possibly allow to further strengthen causal inference. Finally, as has been noted previously, the UKB cohorts may not represent the general UK population, 69 and analyses were limited to individuals of European ancestry; caution is warranted before generalizing findings to other populations.Further, each pain medication phenotype was a binary variable (use/nonuse), so we could not assess potential dosedependent changes in risk associated with prescription opioid use.
