        <p>The performance of motor imagery (MI) based Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) is easily affected by noise and redundant information that exists in the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG). To solve this problem, many temporal and spatial feature based channel selection methods have been proposed. However, temporal and spatial features do not accurately reflect changes in the power of the oscillatory EEG. Thus, spectral features of MI-related EEG signals may be useful for channel selection. Bispectrum analysis is a technique developed for extracting non-linear and non-Gaussian information from non-linear and non-Gaussian signals. The features extracted from bispectrum analysis can provide frequency domain information about the EEG. Therefore, in this study, we propose a bispectrumbased channel selection (BCS) method for MI-based BCI. The proposed method uses the sum of logarithmic amplitudes (SLA) and the first order spectral moment (FOSM) features extracted from bispectrum analysis to select EEG channels without redundant information. Three public BCI competition datasets (BCI competition IV dataset 1, BCI competition III dataset IVa and BCI competition III dataset IIIa) were used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results indicate that our BCS method outperforms use of all channels (83.8% vs 69.4%, 86.3% vs 82.9% and 77.8% vs 68.2%, respectively).

        <p>B RAIN-COMPUTER Interfacing (BCI) provides a new external pathway which can use brain signals to control devices (e.g., wheelchairs, robot arms, drones etc.) without involvement of the muscles [1], [2]. Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI is one of the most commonly studied BCI systems. It has the advantages of being non-invasive, low cost, and highly portable [3]. Currently, P300 [4]- [7], steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) [8], [9], and motor imagery (MI) [10]- [13] based BCIs are the three main research directions in the field of EEG-based BCI. Although P300 and SSVEP based BCI systems have better classification accuracies and information transfer rates (ITRs), these two kinds BCI are limited because of the need for an external stimulus [14], [15]. Compared with stimulation-based BCIs, MI-based BCIs are often more intuitive for their users. When individuals imagine movement of their body there are associated changes in the power of the oscillatory EEG. These changes are known as event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) [16], and their accurate detection is the basic principle of MI based BCI.B RAIN-COMPUTER Interfacing (BCI) provides a new external pathway which can use brain signals to control devices (e.g., wheelchairs, robot arms, drones etc.) without involvement of the muscles [1], [2].

        <p>In order to solve the problem of performance degradation due to the redundant information and noise across multiple EEG channels [17], many researchers have proposed channel selection methods for MI-based BCI. Considering the neurophysiologic knowledge, the simplest channel selection method is to extract data from EEG channels Cz, C3, and C4, which are located over the motor cortex.In order to solve the problem of performance degradation due to the redundant information and noise across multiple EEG channels [17], many researchers have proposed channel selection methods for MI-based BCI.

In contrast, wrapper methods make use of a classifier to validate the effects of different sets of selected channels. However, those methods are most frequently used to select channels based on their temporal [18], [19] or spatial features [17].Channel selection methods can be categorized as either filter [18] or wrapper [17] based methods.

        <p>A. Data Descriptions DS1: We denote the dataset 1 from the BCI Competition IV [36] as DS1 in this study. DS1 contains MI EEG data recorded from 7 participants. However, we only use the data for participants 'a', 'b', 'f' and 'g' because the data for participants 'c', 'd' and 'e' are artificially generated. At the beginning of each run, a fixation cross was displayed at the center of the computer screen for 2 s. Then, an arrow with the direction of left, right or down was displayed for 4 s to instruct participants to perform the corresponding MI task. Next, participants were asked to rest for 2 s while looking at a blank screen. After the rest time, the next trials occurred. Each of run contained 100 trials. The timeline of each trial is shown in Fig. 3(a). We down-sampled the EEG recorded from 59 channels to 100 Hz. The channels were positioned according international EEG 10-20 systems.

        <p>Tam et al. proposed a channel selection method called CSP-rank in 2011 [38]. This method first calculates the projection matrix w according to Eq. ( 8). Then, the absolute values of elements of the eigenvectors corresponding to the maximum and minimum eigenvalues were used alternately to select channel. The first channel is selected according to the maximum absolute values of either elements of these two eigenvectors. The index of the maximum absolute member of the eigenvector denotes the channel to select. The second channel is selected according to the maximum absolute value of the elements of the other eigenvectors. If the channel is already selected, the channel corresponding to the next maximum absolute value will be selected. According this selecting method, all channels will be sorted.Tam et al. proposed a channel selection method called CSP-rank in 2011 [38].

        <p>As can be seen, for all three dataset (e.g., DS1, DS2, and DS3), the proposed BCS method can achieve the highest classification accuracies. Specifically, for four participants from DS1, the mean accuracies are 69.4% (with AC-CSP), 65.4% (with 3C-CSP), 79.1% (with CSP-Rank), and 83.8% (with BCS -CSP), respectively.

        <p>We also compare the number of selected channels when using the different channel selection methods. Table II shows the number of selected channels using AC-CSP, 3C-CSP, CSP-Rank, and our proposed method. The * indicates that the average selected number of channels is not an integer, and the displayed number is the result of rounding up. The 3C-CSP method was not applied to DS3 because the information about electrode positions is not provided in DS3. As can be seen, to achieve the best classification number of channels using the and BCS-CSP methods is similar (24 vs 25 for DS1, 63 vs 79 for DS2, 27 vs 14 for DS3).We also compare the number of selected channels when using the different channel selection methods.

        <p>To investigate the distribution of selected channels, we sort all channels based on their F scores, which are calculated according to Eq. ( 4). The index score (IS) of the channel with the highest F score is the number of all channels (e.g., 59 for DS1 and 118 for DS2). The IS of the channel with the second highest F score is equal to the number of all channels minus one, and so on. Hence, for 10-fold validation, all channels can get 10 IS numbers. Then, we sort all channels according to the average IS. The range of average IS values for DS1 and DS2 is 1 to 59 and 1 to 118, respectively. According to the average IS, we plot the topography for all participants from DS1 and DS2 using

            <rs type="version">2019a</rs> with the 
            <rs type="software">EEGLAB</rs> toolbox [39]. Fig. 5 shows the distribution of selected channels for participants a, b, f, and g from DS1. Red colored areas indicate higher IS values, while blue color areas indicate lower IS values. It can be seen that the channels with high average IS values (red color) for participants a and g are located in the vicinity of both channels CCP3 and CCP4. For participants b and f, the channels with high average IS values are located in the vicinity of channels CCP3 or CCP4.

        <p>Fig. 6 shows the distribution of selected channels for participants aa, al, av, aw, and ay from DS2. The meaning of the color in Fig. 6 is the same as in Fig. 5. As can be seen, for participants aa, al, and aw, the channels with high average IS values are also located in the vicinity of channels CCP3 or CCP4. But for participants av and ay, the channels with high average IS values are only located in the vicinity of channel CCP3. Similarities in the distributions of selected channel for DS1 and DS2 suggests that the BCS algorithm could be identifying neurophysiological meaningful patterns in the data.Fig. 6 shows the distribution of selected channels for participants aa, al, av, aw, and ay from DS2.

        <p>We also used the mean (83.84) and standard deviation (30.16) of the numbers of the original channels and the mean of the numbers channels (44.08) to estimate the statistical power The result that we can achieve the statistical power of 0.8696. The relation between the statistical power and the sample size is shown in Fig. 7.We also used the mean (83.84) and standard deviation (30.16) of the numbers of the original channels and the mean of the numbers channels (44.08) to estimate the statistical power The result that we can achieve the statistical power of 0.8696.

        <p>As shown in Fig. 8, for each participant, we explore the classification accuracies of the data with different numbers of channels. For all three datasets, the trend of classification accuracies is the same, increasing first then decreasing. The reason perhaps is the different proportions of useful and redundant information in the selected channels. When using 4 channels for the first time, even if all information in the 4 channels is not redundant, the discriminative feature is not enough for accurate classification. Then, with the number of selected channels increasing, the discriminative features can be extracted from these channels. But redundant information will become dominant if the number of selected channels is too large. For example, the highest classification accuracy for participant g from DS1 is achieved when using around 13 channels. If too many channels are used, the accuracy of the SVM classifier will deteriorate. In addition, participants k3, k6, and l1 from DS3 also show the same phenomenon.As shown in Fig. 8, for each participant, we explore the classification accuracies of the data with different numbers of channels.

        <p>However, the circumstances for participants aa and ay from DS2 are not identical. As can be seen from Table II, the number of channels which can achieve the best classification accuracies for participants aa and ay are 105 and 111, respectively. This may because each channel has only a small amount of useful information. In order to achieve better performance, a larger number of channels must be used to extract discriminative features for the SVM classifier.However, the circumstances for participants aa and ay from DS2 are not identical.

        <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that using bispectrum features as classifier inputs in BCI systems can achieve good performance [41]- [43]. Moreover, it has been shown that bispectrum can work especially well for MI BCIs because of the ERD/ERS phenomenon which is most frequently analyzed in the frequency domain [44]. Bispectrum amplitudes can represent the phase relationship between two frequency components [22], whereas sum of logarithmic amplitudes (SLA) and first order spectral moment (FOSM) are two most widely used features.Previous studies have demonstrated that using bispectrum features as classifier inputs in BCI systems can achieve good performance [41]- [43].

        <p>However, it is still unclear whether bispectrum features can be used to select channels in BCI systems. Thus, in this study, we proposed a channel selection method based on SLA and FOSM features extracted from the bispectrum. The proposed method can directly use the F score calculated by the SLA and FOSM features to sort channels, which is different from the wrapper-based channel selection methods. For example, in [45], authors use the sequential feature selection method to reduce MEG sensors, which is required to use the classifier to evaluate the effect of the combination of each sequential feature whereas the proposed BCS method can sort all channels at once according the F score of each channel.However, it is still unclear whether bispectrum features can be used to select channels in BCI systems.

        <p>Our proposed method also has some limitations. On the one hand, according to the formula (4), SLA and FOSM features had the same contribution to the process of F score calculation. That is to say, the selected channels were equally affected by the SLA and FOSM features. But the SLA and FOSM are two different features extracted from bispectrum (formula (2) and ( 3)), and using different weights for SLA and FOSM features may have better performance. On the other hand, the effect of different frequency ranges of the filter on the calculation of bispectrum is not to be considered.

        <p>Xing et al. first proposed a metric learning method to improve clustering performance [46]. Recently, Sheoran et al. used various distance metric learning algorithms to map features to a discriminant space, improving the accuracy of epileptic seizure detection [47]. Mapping the SLA and FOSM feature to a discriminant space may be helpful for identifying which channels contain redundant information. Therefore, we will try to combine the metric learning methods to further improve the performance of the BCS algorithm in future work. We will also investigate the different impacts of the SLA, FOSM features and the influences of different frequency ranges of the bandpass filter on the channel selection method in MI based BCIs.Xing et al. first proposed a metric learning method to improve clustering performance [46].
