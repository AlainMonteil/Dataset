        <p>When referring to the study of Rutherford et al. (2015) on shortand long-term effects of rTMS in Alzheimer's disease, we erroneously stated in our article (Lefaucheur et al., 2020) that a clinical benefit on cognitive performance (tested by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) was observed at weeks 2-3, only in the real stimulation condition during an initial sham-controlled 4-week period of treatment, and that then this benefit was prolonged by ''2 additional weeks" of open-label real rTMS. In fact, this extended openlabel treatment was administered for up to 19 months in multiple 2-week blocks with 2-7 months intervals between blocks and was not limited to a single additional 2-week block of treatment imme-diately following the original 4 weeks of treatment. Therefore, the results of that open-label extended follow-up study support the value of long-term maintenance treatment using multiple rTMS sessions rather than be interpreted as short-term 2-week extension.</p>
