        <p>Background: Respiratory tract viruses are the second most common cause for olfactory dysfunction.</p>
        <p>As we learn more about the effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), with the recognition that olfactory dysfunction is a key symptom of this disease process, there is now a greater need for evidence-based management for post infectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD).</p>
        <p>Objective: To provide an evidence based practical guide to the management of PIOD (including postcovid cases) for both primary care practitioners and hospital specialists.</p>
        <p>Methods: A systematic review was performed on the treatment options available for the management of PIOD. The written systematic review was then circulated among the members of the Clinical Olfactory Working Group (COWoG) for their perusal prior to round table expert discussion of the treatment options. The group also undertook a survey to determine their current clinical practice with regards to treatment of PIOD.</p>
        <p>The COWoG members made an overwhelming recommendation for olfactory training and none recommended monocycline antibiotics. The diagnostic role of oral steroids is discussed and there were some in favour of vitamin A drops. Further research is needed to confirm the place of other therapeutic options.</p>
        <p>Patients with COVID-19 and other infection related olfactory dysfunction should be guided through olfactory rehabilitation and be signposted to specialists for other treatments in refractory cases.</p>
        <p>Loss of smell is a common complaint in adults and yet has been underestimated 1 . Anosmia, complete loss of smell, is thought to affect at least 1% of the population with the overall estimated prevalence of olfactory disorders now thought to be over 20% [2][3][4] . Upper respiratory tract infections are usually associated with decreased smell during their acute phase [5][6][7] . Post-infectious olfactory dysfunction (PIOD) represents an important frequent cause of persistent olfactory dysfunction 1 , accounting for 11% of all causes 8 but 20-30% of cases in specialized smell and taste clinics 9,10 and typically (pre-COVID) affecting women over 50 years of age. Olfaction plays important roles in daily life, ranging from safety perception (ability to detect hazardous substances, fire and rotten foods) to psychosocial functions (such as recognition of kin or emotions mediated through body odours) and enjoyment of food and drink 11 . Olfactory dysfunction may therefore lead to significant morbidity in the form of nutritional disturbance, social anxiety or depression [11][12][13] .</p>
        <p>The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic with its devastating global effects has brought public awareness to the impact of viral infections on olfactory function 14,15 . There is now an emerging cluster of new patients with PIODthose infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus as part of the pandemic. With smell loss now an official World Health Organisation symptom of COVID-19, it is estimated that over 60% of those contracting the virus are affected by this symptom [16][17][18][19] , including those who are otherwise asymptomatic 20 . Extrapolating from this figure, it is therefore possible that nearly 20 million people globally will have experienced smell loss due to COVID-19 by October 2020. COVID-19 infection appears to have a different pattern of smell loss than typical PIOD cases with a more profound loss of smell and with taste loss, specifically bitter loss, identified as a discriminating feature 21 . In another study SARS-CoV-2 affected mainly odour thresholds, possibly suggesting that the major cause of loss of smell lies at the level of the olfactory neuroepithelium, rather than in the central nervous system 20 . Current thinking around the mechanism of chemosensory dysfunction in COVID-19 infection suggests that it is caused by viral entry via ACE2 receptors, with infection and death of sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium; this does not necessarily lead to infection, damage, death, and the need for regeneration of olfactory receptor neurons in the majority of cases and hence why they appear to recover within 4 weeks of the onset 22 . The current data suggest that 10-17% have continued smell loss (i.e. COVID-19-related PIOD) and do not recover spontaneously 23,24 . Notably, many of these patients report parosmia during recovery 25 . The reasoning for the persistence of OD in these cases may be attributed to a larger area of the olfactory epithelium being affected by the coronavirus, possibly with cellular death of a larger number of olfactory receptor neurons; further evidence is required to support this theory 22 .</p>
        <p>The current understanding and pathogenesis of non-COVID-19 olfactory dysfunction following a viral upper respiratory tract infection begins with inflammation of the nasal mucosa as a result of the acute infection. This disrupts the natural airway conduction through the nasal cavity hence inhibiting the transport of odorants to the olfactory epithelium. Impaired olfaction may also result from dysfunction at the level of the olfactory receptor neuron, though the precise pathophysiological mechanism is virus dependant. Rhinoviruses, for instance, cause a selective neutrophil and monocyte recruitment to occur. The inflammatory cascade that ensues includes an increase in bradykinin, cytokine, chemokine and sICAM-1 concentrations 26 . The response in an immunocompetent individual involves T-lymphocyte activation allowing the viral pathogen to be eliminated. Viral pathogens that have been implicated in PIOD other than rhinoviruses include parainfluenza virus and Epstein-Barr virus with the frequency of virus found in studies varying 27 ; for example, parainfluenza accounted for 88% in one study 28 , With specific respect to the olfactory apparatus, these viruses appear to cause some partial loss of olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory epithelium. Ultrastructurally, studies have revealed a markedly disorganised epithelium with decrease in the number of olfactory receptor cells and nerve bundles with squamous metaplasia occurring in a few cases 29 . This reduction in the number of olfactory receptor neurons means at the epithelial surface there is a lack of dendrites and vesicles, therefore, a decrease in the area available for odour molecule detection 30 . Jafek et al reported that especially in patients with anosmia the few dendrites that were present did not reach the epithelial surface and appeared shrunken 31 . Patients with PIOD have been also found to have reduced olfactory bulb volume and patchy distribution of neuroepithelia perhaps due to the process of remodelling and replacement 32 . Calculation of the olfactory bulb (OB) volume studied through MRI scanning in coronal T2 sequences demonstrates an overall reduced OB volume on both sides even if normalized to age and sex. OB volume above 40cm 3 for one olfactory bulb shows a trend for a good prognosis for recovery. This must be considered in conjunction with the age, the sex of the patient, the duration between the onset of the symptoms and the period when the test has been made and to other potentials toxins the patient would have been exposed to 32 .</p>
        <p>The prognosis of PIOD is variable; it has been suggested that up to a third of patients presenting at specialised, tertiary smell and taste clinics undergo spontaneous recovery over a period of 12-18 months 33 . The presence of parosmia has recently been demonstrated to be associated with a more favourable prognosis for recovery 34 . Different treatment modalities have been tried, ranging from smell training through to a variety of medical treatments, both topical and systemic 35 . This consensus document aims to combine the collective experience of the COWoG with the current evidence base to establish guidance for medical and non-medical treatments for patients with PIOD.</p>
        <p>In general, evaluation of olfactory dysfunction can be performed by three different methods; subjective, patient reported assessment; psychophysical testing; and less biased measures such as olfactory event-related potentials or functional magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
        <p>Subjective assessment is performed using various methods including, visual analogue scales and questionnaires. Although olfactory specific questionnaires such as the Questionnaire for Olfactory Dysfunction can be used to differentiate between normosmia and hyposmia, they tend to be unreliable compared with psychophysical testing and are best used to assess the impact on quality of life 36 .</p>
        <p>Subjective testing can be a valuable tool in monitoring the clinical effect of treatment and therefore should be used in conjunction with other objective testing 1 . Ideally only validated questionnaires should be used when assessing patients with olfactory dysfunction and these should be used with other psychophysical tests, given their lack of accuracy when used alone 36 .</p>
        <p>Apart from olfactory testing, clinical evaluation should always include nasal endoscopy focusing on the patency of olfactory cleft and the presence of findings suggesting nasal inflammation such as polyps, turbinate hypertrophy, oedema, purulent secretions etc. Assessment in this way should ideally be quantified using a validated scoring system, such as the Lund-Kennedy or Olfactory Cleft Endoscopy scale 37 . In a certain percentage of patients with PIOD an underlying inflammatory process in the nose may already exist and its recognition, if not already diagnosed, could modify the treatment options. Obviously, this has been problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic when face-to-face contact and nasal endoscopy have been avoided where possible. Measures may need to be taken to screen patients for COVID-19 to reduce the potential for transmission of infection to the healthcare team. Where any doubt regarding COVID-19 status exists, appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn.</p>
        <p>Psychophysical assessment of olfactory function employs the use of an olfactory stimulus presented to the patient and the outcome of the test is dependent on the patient's response. It requires a patient who is cooperative, understands and follows instructions 1 . Different aspects of olfactory testing including threshold and suprathreshold assessment can be performed. Odour threshold is the lowest concentration of an odorant detectable to a participant and does not require odour identification 38 .</p>
        <p>Odour discrimination describes the non-verbal ability to differentiate between different odours.</p>
        <p>Odour identification involves both recognition of a stimulus and communication of its correct identity (i.e., the ability to name an odour from a list of descriptors). Odour identification requires previous exposure to odour stimulus, and may therefore be culturally specific, hence these tests need adapting for different communities 1 . The usefulness of testing for multiple psychophysical components of olfaction (e.g. threshold, discrimination and identification) when assessing olfactory dysfunction is debated. There is however good evidence that both odour threshold and supra threshold testing adds to the diagnostic value of psychophysical assessment 39 ; odour threshold detection may be more affected by COVID-19 compared to odour identification 20 .</p>
        <p>There are various tests commercially available which measure either just one aspect of olfaction or multiple components, such as the Sniffin' Sticks test (Burghart, Germany) 40,41 , Smell Diskettes (Novimed, Switzerland) 42 and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (Sensonics, USA) 43 ; other non-commercial tests have also been validated such as the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Centre Test (USA) 44 and the Toyota &amp; Takagi (T&amp;T) olfactometer (Japan) 45 . The U-Sniff has been validated for children 46,47 and the European retronasal test for smell perception when eating 48 .</p>
        <p>Retronasal olfaction can be tested by asking patients to identify flavoured powders. Such tests are useful where there is diagnostic uncertainty. For example, it has been demonstrated that in cases of sudden onset olfactory dysfunction, such as posttraumatic loss, both orthonasal and retronasal functions decline concurrently. However, more progressive dysfunction, such as is seen in sinonasal disease, may preferentially affect the orthonasal route whilst retronasal olfaction may be preserved 49,50 . As part of a full olfactory assessment, screening of gustatory function should be undertaken. This can be achieved using liquids applied to the tongue for sweet, salty, sour or bitter (umami is not commonly screened for as it is poorly identified).</p>
        <p>Electrophysiological studies include electroencephalography (EEG) and electro-olfactograms (EOG -the recording of generator potentials via an electrode in contact with the olfactory neuroepithelium).</p>
        <p>As EEG and EOG are both event-related, delivery of a known concentration of odorant must be precisely controlled using an olfactometer, which requires certain equipment and specific technical expertise and this limits the use of such testing for routine clinical purposes 51 . MRI scanning allows for calculation of olfactory bulb volume, olfactory sulcus depth, and upstream volumetric assessment of olfactory eloquent regions all of which have been linked to olfactory function 52,53 . In addition, CT and MRI provide information regarding inflammation of nasal and paranasal mucosa in cases with suggestive history of concomitant inflammatory pathology where endoscopy was not conclusive. They may also reveal evidence of central pathology contributing to smell dysfunction, such as sequelae of prior head trauma or microvascular disease. Functional MRI can provide dynamic assessment of olfactory related cortical activity but is limited in its use in individual patients 54 .</p>
        <p>A comprehensive electronic database search based on the updated guidelines for systematic reviews of the Cochrane Collaboration Review Group 55 and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was performed 56 . The population, intervention, comparisons, outcomes and study design (PICOS) algorithm guided data extraction 57 .</p>
        <p>On 6 July 2020, a systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane database, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase) was conducted. Using the Cochrane methodological filter for randomised control trials (RCTs) in addition to combing MeSH keywords and other relevant terms including, "anosmia", "hyposmia", "dysosmia" ,"parosmia", "pharmacotherapy", "olfactory dysfunction", "post-viral", "post-infectious", "olfactory impairment", "olfactory disturbance", "olfactory loss", "smell disorder", "viral infection", "virus", "viral disease", "common cold", and "respiratory tract infection," were searched to identify primary comparative studies on treatment and management options for post viral olfactory loss. Further cross screenings of the references were performed to complement initial search results. Comparative studies of any design examining the management outcome of patients with post viral olfactory loss were included.</p>
        <p>The level of evidence was established for each publication and the risk of bias was analysed for each study included. The Modified Cochrane Collaboration Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias was applied to level 1 and 2 studies and The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was applied for studies in the level 3 and 4 categories. By following the modified GRADE quality assessment; the quality of evidence for the treatment option was graded and recommendations (table 2) were provided when there was sufficient high-level evidence for a particular intervention. Each subsequent author reviewed, critiqued and amended the recommendations and any discrepancies between the authors were discussed until a consensus was reached.</p>
        <p>All published studies on treatment of PIOD including:</p>
        <p>• Case reports/ letters to the editor/and book chapters • Non-English publications</p>
        <p>• Study subjects with olfactory loss secondary to aetiologies not including PIOD (e.g. post traumatic, congenital, etc)</p>
        <p>The search resulted in 467 citations from which the relevant studies were selected for review and duplicates were removed. In total, 107 articles were fully reviewed and analysed for eligibility; 40 citations fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 11 of which were randomised controlled trials. In total, 15 of the articles specifically looked at PIOD whilst the other 25 included other aetiologies for olfactory dysfunction. All the articles were human studies primarily related to the outcomes of management in patients with PIOD (see flow chartfigure 1)</p>
        <p>The combined total number of patients included in this review were 4983 patients; 2352 (47.2%) patients had PIOD. The patients with PIOD were diagnosed based on self-reported history of a preceding (viral) upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). A diagnosis of PIOD should be made in line with international guidelines 58 . The most commonly used test kit was the Sniffin' Sticks (n = 18 98 Prospective case study N=56 PIOD=21</p>
        <p>Self-reporting Vitamin A 100,000 units for 6weeks followed by 50,000-15000 units of oral preparation for up to 12weeks 12 16 patients had marked improvement</p>
        <p>Conservative management</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that at least one third of patients presenting for evaluation of persistent PIOD had spontaneous recovery of their sense of smell without any treatment; this is in addition to the fact that many more patients will never present to a clinician due to spontaneous resolution, even if longer than the usual timecourse of an acute URTI. Reden et al, 2006 studied 262 patients with PIOD and showed a 32% spontaneous recovery rate, although 6% of the cohort had worsening olfactory function after 14 months of follow up 33 . In another study of 542 patients, London et al 2007 demonstrated that regardless of aetiology, over a third of patients had spontaneous improvement of olfaction 99 . The rate of recovery was dependent on the degree of initial loss, age and the duration of olfactory loss 99 . Hence, an individualised discussion about the prognosis and likelihood of spontaneous recovery should be undertaken with all patients. Especially in the case of COVID-19 infection spontaneous recovery seems to be faster and with higher incidence and this information would be valuable to be explained in those patients. Similarly, the possible deterioration of their sense of smell without any treatment should also be explained for them to make an informed decision.</p>
        <p>Quantification of recovery will depend on the study, but in most studies, improvement is defined as an improvement in psychophysical olfactory tests. For example in the "Sniffin Sticks" that would be a change of 5.5 points or more in the TDI score 100 .</p>
        <p>There is good evidence to suggest that OT improves olfactory function in patients with PIOD. There are three meta-analyses [101][102][103] and several prospective controlled studies that have shown improved olfactory function in patients who had olfactory training, using long term (&gt;32 weeks), high concentration odorants. The classic OT involves a five-minute exposure to four different odorants twice a day 68 . These four odorants (phenyl ethyl alcohol, eucalyptol, citronellal and eugenol) are said to represent four of the six most significant odour qualities of the olfactory spectrum and have been shown</p>
        <p>to improve olfactory loss after training of 12 weeks or more.</p>
        <p>The concept of modified olfactory training (MOT) was first published by Altundag et al 2015 63 The four-odorants used in the classic OT were initially used for 12 weeks. This was followed by a second set of odorants (menthol, thyme, tangerine and jasmine) for a further 12 weeks and followed lastly by a third set of odorants (green tea, bergamot, rosemary, and gardenia) for the final 12-week period. The study was able to demonstrate better odour discrimination and identification in patients treated with the modified technique compared to the classic technique (P&lt;0.001).</p>
        <p>Smoking has been shown to increase the prevalence and severity of olfactory dysfunction 2,104 .</p>
        <p>However, the role of smoking in olfactory loss remains a contentious issue, as other studies suggest a possible protective effect 105 . While the most recent meta-analysis on the topic concluded that current smoking was associated with increased risk of olfactory dysfunction 106 , data specifically on effects of smoking in PIOD is sparse. In a recent retrospective study, no association between smoking status and olfactory function was found in 1,313 PIOD patients 107 . However, as smoking cessation seems to have a positive effect on olfactory function 108 , this may be beneficial for some patients to undertake.</p>
        <p>Studies exploring the use of various formulations, routes and doses of steroid in the treatment of PIOD patients have shown some favourable outcomes 70,78,80,86,109 . There are however no large randomised control trials focused on PIOD patients. Nguyen et al, 2018 was able to show clinically and statistically significant (p=0.024) improvement in olfactory function in randomised patients treated with OT combined with budesonide irrigation compared to the control group (OT plus saline irrigation) 70 . It was however not clear from this study if the improvement in olfactory function after the 8-month follow up was due to spontaneous recovery or steroid effect as patients had to have had anosmia for only six months to be included in the study. It was also not clear on the method for ruling out inflammatory contribution to smell loss which would improve with the topical steroid rinses. Various comparative studies have shown improvement in olfactory function in 25-55% of patients following treatment with steroids. In a randomised control trial by Seo et al 2016, 40 mg oral prednisolone as monotherapy or in combination with 80 mg of ginkgo biloba for 4 weeks was shown to have significant improvement (P&lt;0.001) using both BTT and CCSIT scores 86 . The treatment response rate was 33% in the combination therapy group compared to 14% in the monotherapy group (p=0.08). This study did not include a placebo or control group to ascertain if the improvement was statistically significant in comparison to an untreated group.</p>
        <p>The question of oral versus topical steroids was evaluated by Kim et al 2017, in a retrospective study of 491 patients of which 178 had PIOD 78 . This study showed that the combination of oral and topical steroids or oral steroid as monotherapy significantly improves olfactory function compared to monotherapy with topical steroids and there was no significant difference between monotherapy of oral steroids or as a combination with topical steroid (p= 0.978). Heilmann et al, 2004 demonstrated in an unblinded study, a significant improvement in PIOD patients treated with oral prednisolone (p=0.05) but also showed no significant improvement in the group treated with mometasone propionate 91 .</p>
        <p>It has been suggested that the favourable effect of oral corticosteroids in PIOD could be attributed to their efficacy on any underlying sinonasal inflammation 1,110 , possibly due to the mucosal effects of an upper respiratory tract infection; there is no definitive evidence of any additional effect on the olfactory neuroepithelium.</p>
        <p>It has however been suggested that the technique of delivery of topical steroids may be the reason for the poor response to topical steroids; with the Kaiteki position (patients lie on the side with their head tilted and chin turned upward) allows nasal drops to reach the olfactory cleft in 96% of decongested noses and 75% in the non-decongested nose 111 .</p>
        <p>Interestingly, intranasal injection of steroid has also been shown to improve significantly the olfactory function in this group of patients. In a Japanese study, Fukazawa, 2005 injected the nasal mucosa around the olfactory cleft using dexamethasone at two-weekly intervals on 8-10 occasions and was able to show 49.6% improvement in 162 patients using VAS scores. This was a non-randomised study and although T&amp;T was also used as an investigative tool, no results of this was provided 90 .</p>
        <p>Although there is no data for post-COVID PIOD, there is increasing support for the use of corticosteroids in severe COVID to treat respiratory distress or systemic cytokine storm [112][113][114] , suggesting some potential value for managing respiratory system inflammation. Although evidence is lacking for using steroids in post-COVID PIOD, and that there is the confounding problem of steroid administration in severe disease, awareness that the treatment is safe and potentially valuable for COVID may tilt in the favour of an empirical trial for COVID PIOD 115 . Patients with a short history of anosmia as potentially positive in SARS-CoV2 should not take oral steroids until the full clinical presentation of the infection can be recognised. In any case the decision to initiate steroid therapy should be based on a multi-dimensional risk-benefit assessment and detailed discussion with the patient with regard to respiratory failure, considering existing co-morbidities, imaging findings and the implications of taking a short course of steroids.</p>
        <p>Theophylline: The mechanism of action of theophylline on olfactory neuroepithelium is not fully understood. Theophylline is suggested to inhibit phosphodiesterase and increase secondary messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) therefore aiding olfactory neuroepithelium regeneration 81,116 . There are no specific studies on theophylline in patients with PIOD. Henkin et al in 2009 evaluated 312 patients with hyposmia of multiple aetiologies treated with 200mg-800mg of theophylline and was able to show 50.3% of patients have statistically significant improvement in olfactory function. These patients were followed up between 6-72 months 81 . In 2012 the same group was also able to show improvement in olfactory function after treatment with intranasal theophylline in an unblinded pilot study 117 . Interpretation of these results should be viewed with caution as methodological flaws include having only been performed in one centre using non-standardised olfactory tests, multiple treatment arms and changes in treatment 81,116 .</p>
        <p>Sodium Citrate: Intranasal sodium citrate, by its ability to sequester calcium ions, is thought to reduce free mucosal calcium with subsequent reduction in negative feedback and increasing sensitivity to odorants. Whitcroft et al, 2016 performed a prospective placebo-controlled trial of monorhinal treatment of sodium citrate versus sodium chloride for patients with olfactory loss (multiple aetiologies, n=57) and showed improved olfactory threshold and identification only in the PIOD cohort (n=7) 72 .</p>
        <p>Philpott et al, 2017 compared a single application of 0.5ml of 9% sodium citrate per nostril versus sterile water (n=55) in a randomised controlled trial and showed statistically significant improvement in olfactory function using olfactory thresholds for phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA), 1-butanol and eucalyptol with thresholds measured up to 2 hours after intervention showing an effect lasting between 30 and 120 minutes after application 73 . In the latter study, the response rate was 1 in 3 of the treatment group as compared to none in the control group. More recent studies have provided mixed results 118 .</p>
        <p>The mechanism of the NMDA antagonist, Caroverine on the olfactory neuroepithelium, is not entirely clear. Its mode of action is probably through inhibition of the olfactory bulb feedback mechanism. Quint et al, 2002 conducted a randomised control trial on 71 patients with non-conductive loss (PIOD=38) 92 . The treatment group (n =51) had 120mg/day of caroverine and the control group (n=26) had 140mg/day of zinc sulphate. The study included 38 PIOD patients and both groups were treated for 4 weeks, with the treatment group demonstrating statistically significant improvement in odour identification (p=0.042) and odour threshold (p=0.005) in patients with both anosmia and hyposmia. This therapeutic option certainly lends itself to further evaluation in a well-designed RCT. 75 . This study however has the inherent problem of any retrospective study in that, the inability to control the differences between the groups may have confounded the results.</p>
        <p>Minocycline: Minocycline has been shown to act as an anti-apoptotic agent which may improve olfactory function. Randomised, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study by Reden et al, 2011 using oral 50 mg/bd of minocycline versus placebo for 3 weeks found no statistical difference between the two groups 84 .</p>
        <p>Zinc sulphate: All of the studies using zinc sulphate have reported no statistically significant improvement in olfactory function post-treatment, especially in PIOD 94,95</p>
        <p>Traditional Chinese Acupuncture (TCA): A non-randomised prospective study by Vent et al, 2010 was able to show significant improvement in PIOD patients with traditional Chinese acupuncture (n=15) compared with those treated with vitamin B (n=15) 85 . As stated in table 1, this study had a high risk of bias. However, a re-analysis of their data conducted by Doty et al did not support any improvement and it appears on current evidence that this treatment is not supported 119 .</p>
        <p>The survey was designed to ascertain how members of the COWoG recommend the treatment options identified from the literature review in clinical practice. Figure 2 shows the results obtained from the survey which shows clearly, an overwhelming recommendation for olfactory training and definitely no recommendation for monocycline antibiotics.</p>
        <p>There was some discordance on oral steroids with similar number of experts likely to recommend versus similar numbers unlikely to recommend it. The consensus was that perhaps three to four days of oral steroids may be used as a diagnostic tool, in that, if the patient were to respond to this, then a conductive component may be present and a full course of steroids either for one week or a reducing regimen may prove to be useful but the risk and benefit of this need discussion with the patient. A prescription of prednisolone should be 0.5mg/kg; therefore, a typical adult would receive 40mg/day for 1-2 weeks followed by a reducing course by 5mg/day over 1 week until stopping. If complete recovery occurs after 1 week of oral steroids, this should lead the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis of PIOD.</p>
        <p>The group had a similar opinion with regards to recommendation of nasal steroid as they did of oral steroids. But the side effect profile of nasal steroids being better than systemic steroids means that this perhaps will be a safer option to recommend. However, attention should be given to delivery instructions as nasal steroids are better applied in olfactory cleft area when sprayed by means of special nozzles (such as a laryngeal mucosal atomisation device) or as nasal drops in specific head positions e.g. Kaiteki position 111 , with the head in a dependent position.</p>
        <p>With the exception of vitamin A, the other treatment options including theophylline, zinc sulphate, sodium citrate, caroverine, and -lipoic acid were all less likely to be recommended by the expert panel.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a fair number of the experts would recommend using vitamin A drops for treatment of PIOD compared to sodium citrate. Although sodium citrate and vitamin A drops have shown promise in the treatment of PIOD, the only randomised control trial investigating the use of oral vitamin A did not show significant difference between vitamin A and placebo, although significant improvement was seen in the vitamin A group. Topical vitamin A has shown more promise but does require further RCTs to underpin the existing data. Sodium citrate has been shown to improve odour threshold and identification to varying degrees in the literature with the PIOD group showing the best responses.</p>
        <p>1. Perceived lack of clinical importance: The negative effect of olfactory dysfunction on the quality of life of patients is not widely appreciated and is often ignored or trivialised 13 . This is particularly important in the COVID era, where priorities are placed on initial survival, organ impairment, and transmissibility. Various surveys of patients with olfactory dysfunction, have shown the significant morbidity associated with this disability including problems with hazard avoidance, food related problems and problems with managing odours, and social isolation [11][12][13]120 . Yet, the vast majority of clinicians do not place the same order of importance when it comes to treating this problem. An example of this is highlighted in the American Medical Association's guide to evaluation of permanent impairment which quantifies permanent olfactory loss as 1-5% of impairment compared to deafness or visual loss which is quantified as 35% and 85% impairment respectively 121 .</p>
        <p>2. Lack of testing: Most general practitioners and even otolaryngology departments do not offer standardized qualitative or quantitative assessments for patients who present with olfactory dysfunction 38 and therefore, have no way of monitoring improvements. In general, a full Ear Nose and Throat examination is performed in the clinical setting, in addition to anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy should also be performed, ideally with a 0° Hopkins rod lens endoscope (4mm diameter or smaller) to start and a 30° endoscope may then be used to facilitate visualisation of the olfactory cleft 1 . Some patients may have MRI scans depending on their presenting symptoms, but a significant number of patients may not have any subjective or psychophysical testing which is key to offering management options 1 .</p>
        <p>3. Availability of treatment: During the expert discussion, it was clear that some of the treatments discussed above were not readily available for clinical use. This therefore provides a challenge in treating patients with these drugs. The bureaucracy surrounding the ability to obtain these medications for the number of patients who present with olfactory dysfunction is increasingly making it difficult to offer treatment options for patients. Consequently, most of these treatment options are not widely used in the clinical situation. Oral and topical steroids are cheap and widely available making its use more practical in most settings.</p>
        <p>The relatively few patients accrued in the studies referenced in Table 1 underscore the challenges to date for studies of PIOD. Single institutions may be unlikely to recruit enough patients with clear OD aetiology, of recent occurrence, and appropriate enrolment criteria, to power studies placebo-controlled studies. However, the current COVID pandemic offers a rare opportunity to pursue such studies for the benefit of COVID patients, where findings may be extended to other PIOD cases in the future.</p>
        <p>Figure 3 below sets out a flow chart for management in primary care 1. History and examination: A thorough history should be undertaken focusing on the specifics of impairment (qualitative or quantitative, gustatory attributes (specifically distinguishing aroma from basic tastes), etc), onset, duration, any fluctuations, effects on the quality of life, medication history, past medical history, allergies, previous episodes of sinusitis, smoking, alcohol consumption (liver cirrhosis) [122][123][124] , exposure to toxins, prior significant head trauma, and family history 125 . If sudden onset of smell loss has occurred, then clinicians should assume that in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 infection is possible and take necessary precautions with swab testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) if face-to-face contact is needed.</p>
        <p>2. Examination: Full head and neck examination should be carried out, noting any evidence of upper respiratory infection. Basic neurological examination should also be performed. However, we note that many GPs are now performing remote consultations where this is not feasible, but if face-to-face contact is made, then a basic nasal examination (anterior rhinoscopy) should be the minimum assessment.</p>
        <p>3. Olfactory testing: We would consider that olfactory assessment in patients reporting olfactory dysfunction with a psychophysical test is mandatory due to the poor correlation between subjective assessment and test performance but also in order to fully determine disease burden and clinical impact of interventions 1 . However, we recognise that in general practice this is not usually practically possible (especially with remote consultations) and thus ideally validated questionnaires (such as the Olfactory Disorders Questionnaire) 36,120,126 should be used and if this is not possible, a recognised form of assessment, possibly quantitative and/or anchored, such as a visual analogue scale, should be used. A quick screening test such as the Q-Sticks test 127 .</p>
        <p>4. Treatment options: Although there is limited evidence for the treatment options available, some treatment options have shown promise and may be useful in selected patients. b. Steroids: As discussed above, a trial of oral steroids can aid the diagnosis of PIOD and may be used in carefully selected patients, following careful explanation of potential side effects and the limited existing data supporting its use. Diagnostic (NOT therapeutic) oral steroid trials for a limited number of days, can help to rule out concomitant residual congestion that may accompany PIOD and impair other therapeutic attempts (smell training, spontaneous recovery). Topical steroids have the benefit of a better side effect profile compared to the systemic option, hence a trial of this may be appropriate. Most GPs will defer to specialist advice rather than prescribe oral steroids, so we recognise that this may be the next step if smell training has not helped.</p>
        <p>5. Referral to ENT specialist 6. Counselling on the hazards of smell disturbances should be undertaken at any opportunity, including advice on labelling food and gas detectors in the home environment 12,13 . Further help and support can be found through online fora such as the charity Fifth Sense (www.fifthsense.org.uk).</p>
        <p>The advice is not that patients "should sniff odours as often as possible". The odours for this training include rose, eucalyptus, clove and lemon.</p>
        <p>1. Place each item into a separate bowl/jar or just take the raw material into your hands 2. Slowly and gently, inhale naturallysniffing too quickly and deeply is likely to result in you not being able to detect anything 3. Repeat this for 20-30 seconds. Practical Guide for Otorhinolaryngologists 2. Assessment: In patients reporting olfactory dysfunction, psychophysical olfactory assessment is mandatory in order to confirm quantitative olfactory loss and fully determine disease burden but also for the clinical impact of interventions. Where possible, validated questionnaires should be used in addition 36,120,128 . Where this is not possible, a recognized form of assessment, possibly quantitative and/or anchored, such as a visual analogue scale, should be used. Subjective olfactory assessment should not be undertaken in isolation, given its poor accuracy.</p>
        <p>3. Modified olfactory training: recent evidence suggests that use of this method over a 24-36 week period is superior to performing the classical training. This training method involves the use of the classical regime for 12 weeks and then swapping to menthol, thyme tangerine, jasmine for 12 weeks, and green tea, rosemary, bergamot, gardenia for 12 weeks.</p>
        <p>4. Treatment optionssee figure 4.</p>
        <p>The olfactory loss experienced by some patients who have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 has brought to light the need for good evidence-based management for patients with PIOD. This review highlights the importance of olfactory training in the treatment of PIOD. The evidence for the use of medical treatment in PIOD is quite weak but it is clear that there are additional management options available for motivated patients. Oral and topical steroids may still have a role in management with Vitamin A and sodium citrate as an alternate treatment option. Non-medical options such as acupuncture need to be further investigated. The ENT research community now needs to convince funding bodies for the need to deliver more RCTs that can usefully inform clinicians on the place of these therapies and help to treat this much maligned group of patients. With an expectedly large number of patients with a common aetiology (COVID-19) and increasing awareness of PIOD, the opportunity for rigorous study is apparent.</p>
