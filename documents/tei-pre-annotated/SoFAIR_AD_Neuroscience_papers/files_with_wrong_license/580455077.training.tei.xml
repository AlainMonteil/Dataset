        <p>Photoswitching dynamics of common organic photoisomers in solid state are often reduced compared to the solution state due to the close packing of molecules that limits structural changes. The facile solidstate switching of photoisomers has implications in developing novel light-controlled devices such as actuator, field-effect transistor, and photodetector, as well as photon energy storage materials that can be charged by light and release thermal energy upon triggering. Thus, the solid-state photoswitching of organic molecules has been studied in relation to the structural characteristics, and various effective methods to enhance the switching in condensed phases have been developed. This review highlights isomerization dynamics of common photoswitches in solid and then introduces important strategies for facilitating the switching dynamics, including the covalent functionalization methods for small-molecule photoswitches as well as the incorporation of various templates such as porous medium, nanoparticle, and host-guest structure. Furthermore, the solid-state switching of molecules at the interface with inorganic substrates including 2D materials and the microscopy techniques for the characterization will be further described.Photoswitching dynamics of common organic photoisomers in solid state are often reduced compared to the solution state due to the close packing of molecules that limits structural changes.

        <p>Photoswitches are molecules that undergo structural changes in response to light irradiation. The molecules generally possess two stable isomeric forms that are under equilibrium and can be reversibly obtained by irradiation and thermal activation [1]. As a result of the isomerization and the distinct molecular properties of isomers, such as polarity [2], steric hindrance [3], and optical properties [4], the photoswitches have been incorporated to various platforms to exert light-induced changes to the bulk properties including surface energy [5], morphology [6], and color [7] of bulk solids. Accordingly, various applications of photoswitches have been developed, taking advantage of the fast, drastic, and reversible change in properties that can be addressed by light illumination. Examples include the light-induced actuation of thin films [8], photon energy storage in bulk materials [9,10], lightactivated drug release from solid carriers [11], photomagnetic switching [12,13], and hydrophobicity switching of heterogeneous surface [14].Photoswitches are molecules that undergo structural changes in response to light irradiation.

        <p>However, the photoswitching molecules incorporated to solid platforms often exhibit limited switching due to the severe steric hindrance induced by the close packing of molecules, particularly in crystalline lattice, which remains a challenge [15]. This incomplete switching or the lack of switching of molecules results in the absence of functionality that can be modulated by light irradiation. The photoisomerization behavior of switches is first studied in dilute solutions by UVevis absorption or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which reflects the maximum switchability or photostationary state of each isomer, due to the facile structural change in molecules in the solvated state. The dilute dispersion of molecules in amorphous [16] and elastomeric polymer matrix [17] also exhibits similar behavior to solution-state switches due to the unhindered environment for rotation or inversion of molecular structures.However, the photoswitching molecules incorporated to solid platforms often exhibit limited switching due to the severe steric hindrance induced by the close packing of molecules, particularly in crystalline lattice, which remains a challenge [15].

        <p>The dilute solutions or dispersion systems, however, lower the density of photoactive units per volume or mass, leading to the insufficient change in bulk properties. In particular, the photon energy storage in solid-state photoswitching materials requires high gravimetric density of energy (J/g) for thermal applications [9], which indicates the importance of facile switching of photoactive moieties at high density. It is indeed a significant challenge to balance the molecular density with the free space between molecules in condensed phase. The strategies to tackle this challenge have been developed, particularly through chemical modification of pristine photoswitching units.The dilute solutions or dispersion systems, however, lower the density of photoactive units per volume or mass, leading to the insufficient change in bulk properties.

        <p>In this review, we will highlight the effective strategies applied to organic photoswitches that are either traditional or newly developed, to maximize the degree of isomerization in solid state. Different strategies are applied to photoswitches depending on the structure; thus, we first introduce the general photoswitching schematics for the switches discussed in this review. There is a plethora of molecules capable of photoinduced isomerization, each with their own unique structural changes (Scheme 1). Photoisomerization requires a change in volume, whether the mechanism be through rotation or inversion about the original double bond, through ring-opening, or a combination of the two.In this review, we will highlight the effective strategies applied to organic photoswitches that are either traditional or newly developed, to maximize the degree of isomerization in solid state.

        <p>Photoswitches undergoing large structural changes include azobenzenes, hydrazones, and indigoids, all of which involve the isomerization about a double bond through E-to-Z or trans-to-cis transformation upon photoirradiation. The dihedral angle between aromatic/fused rings attached to the central double bond changes between ~90 and ~170 through structural isomerization, which depends on the size and structure of the rings [18e21].Photoswitches undergoing large structural changes include azobenzenes, hydrazones, and indigoids, all of which involve the isomerization about a double bond through E-to-Z or trans-to-cis transformation upon photoirradiation.

        <p>Azobenzenes, one of the most widely studied classes of photoswitches, consist of two benzene rings connected via a central azo group. Generally, upon irradiation with UV light, this azo group is able to isomerize from E to Z conformation. The reverse process is triggered either through thermal activation or by visible light irradiation. Potential applications for azobenzenes in the solid state include photon energy storage [22e24] and nanoimprint lithography [25].

        <p>Hydrazones have only recently been exploited for their photoswitching properties by Aprahamian et al. Hydrazones can exhibit two thermodynamically stable isomeric forms, depending on the H-bond acceptors present in the molecule, both intra and intermolecularly [27,28], as well as para electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups functionalized on the benzene ring [29]. One can therefore, by changing the H-bond acceptors, tune the E/Z ratio at equilibrium upon photoswitching, which is a vast improvement Scheme 1.

        <p>Indigoids have been studied greatly by Dube et al. [32], and their E-to-Z isomerization can be carried out by visible light irradiation for both forward and reverse processes, which makes them attractive candidates for biological applications including photopharmacology. Isomerization occurs about the double bond connecting the hemiindigo/aryl groups. Many variations of indigoids exist, including indigos (X ¼ N), thioindigos (X ¼ S), hemiindigos (X ¼ N), and hemithioindigos (X ¼ S). Although indigoids have not been studied as extensively as the above-mentioned photoswitches, they do exhibit favorable characteristics such as high quantum yields (~56%) and thermal stability.Indigoids have been studied greatly by Dube et al.

        <p>DAEs involve two aryl groups connected by a central ethene group. Upon irradiation with UV light, the two aryl groups make a new covalent s bond to form a central six-membered ring, which can be reversed upon visible light irradiation. Although this ringclosing behavior is accompanied by a slight decrease in length (~0.11 nm) along the horizontal axis, it results in a small increase in length (~0.07 nm) vertically [33].

        <p>While the molecules discussed so far exhibit one-step transformation, other molecules involve two-step isomerization that requires s bond dissociation (i.e. ring-opening) followed by the rotation of a bond in the open form.

        <p>1,8a-Dihydroazulene-1,1-dicarbonitrile (DHA) also undergoes two-step isomerization. When irradiated with UV light or treated by a strong Lewis acid, DHAs open up the cyclopentene unit to generate a conjugated diene structure named vinylheptafulvene (VHF). Upon ring-opening, VHF rapidly converts from its syn conformation to its thermodynamically stable anti form. The reverse isomerization steps are facilitated by thermal activation. Studies have shown that the mechanism for DHA-to-VHF photoswitching in solution involves a highly polar transition state [39] while the solid-state transition proceeds through a diradical intermediate [40]. Other studies indicated that ring closure proceeds through a zwitterionic transition state and DHA forms in two pairs of enantiomers, of which the ratio can be manipulated by solvent polarity [39].1,8a-Dihydroazulene-1,1-dicarbonitrile (DHA) also undergoes two-step isomerization.

        <p>Spiropyrans (SP) and spirooxazines (SO) photoisomerize from the closed neutral form to the open zwitterionic merocyanine (MC) form [41]. When irradiated with UV light, the CeO s bond of SP and SO breaks to form the transient Z isomer of MC. This quickly converts to the more thermodynamically stable E form exhibiting a more linear structure [42,43]. The switching processes can be monitored by a color change from the colorless closed form to the blue/violet open form. Common uses for SP and SO are in optical storage/memory devices [44]. In addition, they are promising for biological applications due to their solubility in aqueous solutions [45]. Heckel et al. in particular have demonstrated successful photoswitching and incorporation of SP into oligonucleotides in vitro [46] as well as their low toxicity and resistance to hydrolysis in biological conditions [45].

        <p>Chromenes exhibit ring-opening upon UV light irradiation through a short-lived transoid-cis (TC) form. The TC is thermally unstable and can either revert back to the closed-ring chromene or isomerize to its transoid-trans (TT) form depending on the respective activation energy. Both the TT and TC form can isomerize back to the closed form via visible light irradiation [48]. These forms, along with the open MC form of SP, are controllable through thermal activation based on studies done on isomerization dynamics at low temperatures, which will be further discussed in the next sections [49,50].Chromenes exhibit ring-opening upon UV light irradiation through a short-lived transoid-cis (TC) form.

        <p>Unlike solution-state switching of molecules as widely studied and described in Scheme 1, switching in the solid state is difficult to observe due to the intermolecular stacking and the lack of free space, which limits conformational changes. In addition, metastable photoisomers generated in solid undergo rapid thermal reversion to ground-state isomers at room temperatures. In this section, we discuss examples of photoswitching observed in the solid state, despite low conversion rates, enabled by reducing temperature or by the processes that generate amorphous solid state of switches.Unlike solution-state switching of molecules as widely studied and described in Scheme 1, switching in the solid state is difficult to observe due to the intermolecular stacking and the lack of free space, which limits conformational changes.

        <p>Evidence of photoisomerization of SP to MC in the solid state is limited. Similar to azobenzene, SP molecules pack closely in the condensed phase.

        <p>In solid state, fast thermal reversion (MC-to-SP) results in a short lifetime of the MC isomer at ambient temperature [41]. This suggests that colorless SP crystals may be photoswitching to their colored MC forms in the solid state upon UV light irradiation; however, thermal isomerization significantly lowers the observable MC content, based on minimal photocoloration. Decreasing the temperature reduces the available energy for thermal reversion; therefore, at lower temperatures, photochromic SP 1a and SO 1b crystals exhibit spectral changes and enhanced photocoloration upon photoisomerization to MC isomers (Fig. 1) [43].In solid state, fast thermal reversion (MC-to-SP) results in a short lifetime of the MC isomer at ambient temperature [41].

        <p>Chromenes encompass benzopyrans and naphthopyrans. A study on solid-state photochromism of microcrystalline powders over a temperature range between 80 K and 300 K reveals that various UV-induced isomers are responsible for the photochromic properties of chromenes [49]. Indeed, when the closed form is irradiated, the compound isomerizes to a cisoid-cis (CC) intermediate which rapidly converts to the TC form (Fig. 2a). The TC form is thermally unstable, observed only at low temperatures, as it can easily revert back to the closed form through rotation of the single bond (C 2 eC 3 ). On the other hand, the TT form is more stable than TC, requiring rotation of both the single (C 2 eC 3 ) and double (C 1 ¼C 2 ) bonds in order to revert back to the closed form.Chromenes encompass benzopyrans and naphthopyrans.

        <p>Similar to SP crystals [41], color intensity increases for chromene crystals irradiated at 90 K. These colors are caused by the TC and TT forms, along with two unstable, nonplanar ring-opened species, believed to be cisoid isomers (Fig. 2b). The cisoid isomers, which are extremely short-lived in the solution state, were stable enough at 100 K in the solid state to be observed by steady-state spectroscopy only for compound 2a. In order to observe TT at room temperature, it must first be formed by UV irradiation of the closed form to the TC form at low temperature followed by gentle heating. Both the TC and TT forms do not revert to the closed form upon irradiation with visible light at low temperatures, but rather form a colorless allenylnaphthol intermediate through a process similar to that of photobleaching of chromenes in solution (Fig. 2c). Gradual heating from 80 K to 200 K in the dark returned the photobleached allenylnaphthol intermediate of 2b to the colored TC form [49].Similar to SP crystals [41], color intensity increases for chromene crystals irradiated at 90 K.

        <p>To better understand fundamental photoisomerization mechanisms, studies were performed on hemithioindigo compound 3, a photochromic compound with four different diastereomer forms (Fig. 3). These forms do not interconvert thermally at ambient temperature and therefore allow for observation and identification of primary photoproducts in restricted environments, including rigid matrices of solvent glasses or at very low temperatures. Based on photoswitching studies under 405-nm irradiation of atropisomers 3a and 3b, which are in the Z-state, in frozen solutions of toluene-d 8 and CDCl 2 at À196 C, and diethyl ether/iso-pentane/ ethanol glass at À183 C, there is notable preference for the formation of the double bond isomerization products and, to a lesser extent, isomers obtained from the hula twist pathway. Overall, there is minimal isomerization between Z forms. This demonstrates that increasing viscosity of the surrounding environments has preference for isomerization between Z and E forms, although the specific mechanism followed depends on the solvent [51].To better understand fundamental photoisomerization mechanisms, studies were performed on hemithioindigo compound 3, a photochromic compound with four different diastereomer forms (Fig. 3).

        <p>DHA-to-VHF isomerization, while facile in solution, is significantly more difficult to perform in the solid state. In solution, UV light irradiation of DHA induces isomerization to syn-VHF, which can then easily isomerize to the thermally stable anti-VHF. However, the large structural change that occurs from DHA to the thermally stable anti-VHF means it is inherently prohibitive in the solid state (Fig. 4a). This large structural change is in contrast to the formation of syn-VHF, which shows less structural change as seen by the fit in the stereoscopic drawing of the DHA cavity (Fig. 4b). Although the reaction to syn-VHF is more probable in the solid state, close packing, and therefore steric hindrance, still inhibits isomerization. As a result, the conversion of DHA to syn-VHF under UV irradiation is only 10% after 18 h under ambient conditions.DHA-to-VHF isomerization, while facile in solution, is significantly more difficult to perform in the solid state.

        <p>The use of two-photon excitation to increase isomerization in a single crystal revealed the closed-shell product, syn-VHF, via X-ray photodiffraction. UV excitation to syn-VHF allows switching while maintaining crystallinity because little change occurs to the unit cell. Back-reaction to DHA occurs rapidly upon heating to 298 K. In addition to isomerization through a closed-shell zwitterionic intermediate, the reaction also proceeds via a homolytic bond cleavage, which forms an open-shell diradical species that is stable below 160 K (Fig. 4c). Results from fluorescence decay indicate that at low temperature the reaction is dominated by the diradical mechanism, while above 298 K the diradical is less stable and hence syn-VHF is formed via the closed-shell intermediate.

[43] with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. variable-temperature Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (Fig. 4d) shows that photoirradiation at 77 K causes two nitrile stretches at 2217 cm À1 and 2205 cm À1 . At 298 K, photoirradiation results in a single nitrile stretching band at 2217 cm À1 that does not split upon cooling to 77 K. This supports that the nitrile stretch at 2205 cm À1 is due to a diradical intermediate [52].The use of two-photon excitation to increase isomerization in a single crystal revealed the closed-shell product, syn-VHF, via X-ray photodiffraction.

In addition to isomerization through a closed-shell zwitterionic intermediate, the reaction also proceeds via a homolytic bond cleavage, which forms an open-shell diradical species that is stable below 160 K (Fig. 4c). Results from fluorescence decay indicate that at low temperature the reaction is dominated by the diradical mechanism, while above 298 K the diradical is less stable and hence syn-VHF is formed via the closed-shell intermediate. Furthermore, ,c,d) and 1b (e, f, g), before irradiation (left), after irradiation at room temperature (center), and after irradiation at 90 K (right). Reproduced and adapted from Ref. [43] with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry. variable-temperature Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (Fig. 4d) shows that photoirradiation at 77 K causes two nitrile stretches at 2217 cm À1 and 2205 cm À1 . At 298 K, photoirradiation results in a single nitrile stretching band at 2217 cm À1 that does not split upon cooling to 77 K. This supports that the nitrile stretch at 2205 cm À1 is due to a diradical intermediate [52].</p>
        <p>As a means to investigate kinetics of photoisomerization in the solid state, Garcia-Garibay et al. carried out nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy experiments for the ring-opening photochemical mechanism of SP 5a (Fig. 5a) in acetonitrile and within nanocrystals suspended in aqueous solution. The aqueous environments served to increase the probability of observing single excitation photoprocesses, whereas large single crystals and dry powders would have given rise to complex kinetics from multiphotonic interactions. Comparisons were made between 5a in an acetonitrile solution and nanocrystals of 5a suspended in water, the latter of which is intended to study kinetics in the solid state. Computed UVevis spectra predicted intermediate MC-like structures for 5a. The emergence of transient species allows for lattice disorder that ultimately creates the space to accommodate isomerization in the solid state whereby E-MC is eventually stabilized. Furthermore, the transient absorbance spectra did not show decay of the corresponding MC band between 550 and 650 nm at timescales of up to 4 ms, indicating that a stable E-like MC species is attainable in the crystalline environment, even when using a weaker laser pulse. Ultimately, nanocrystal suspensions provide a method of studying the kinetics of photochromic processes in the solid state by minimizing the probability of multiphoton processes [53].As a means to investigate kinetics of photoisomerization in the solid state, Garcia-Garibay et al. carried out nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy experiments for the ring-opening photochemical mechanism of SP 5a (Fig. 5a) in acetonitrile and within nanocrystals suspended in aqueous solution.

        <p>Cationic pyrido-spiropyrans are a novel type of photoswitch that have been observed to exhibit more facile photochromism in the solid state compared to their neutral counterparts (Fig. 5b). Bulk samples for compound 5c were determined by X-ray powder diffraction to undergo significant disorder of the crystal structure upon irradiation with UV light. The initial structure could not be recovered, and the positive charge on the pyridine N atom may be responsible for the increased stability of the MC form in the solid state. The anion has less of an influence on the observed photochromism, as similar results were observed when different counteranions were employed into the structures [54].Cationic pyrido-spiropyrans are a novel type of photoswitch that have been observed to exhibit more facile photochromism in the solid state compared to their neutral counterparts (Fig. 5b).

        <p>SP derivatives have demonstrated potential in optical information storage. Amorphous films derived from a melt-cooling process show effective patterning when irradiated with UV light; the exposed regions on the film become darker as the MC content increases, despite less than ~1% conversion to MC. These patterns remain for weeks under ambient conditions, with regeneration of the original film induced by simultaneous heating above the glass transition temperature (T g ) and strong visible light irradiation (Fig. 5c). In contrary, patterning is difficult to achieve in the crystalline phase due to the lack of free space from close-packed structure, hindering isomerization from the closed SP form to the open MC form [55].SP derivatives have demonstrated potential in optical information storage.

        <p>Photoswitching of DAE 6a and 6b were investigated in solidstate amorphous films (Fig. 6) prepared by cooling molten samples between two glass plates. The amorphous film composed of 6a remained stable under ambient conditions; however, the film composed of 6b was reported to crystallize in several days. Samples were irradiated with a Xe lamp at 330 nm for 6a and 400 nm for 6b. Compared to the photochromic reaction efficiencies in hexane solution, 6a films possessed a relative cyclization efficiency of 0.49, whereas the crystalline films of 6b did not exhibit any photochromism. However, the amorphous film of 6b was observed to immediately turn purple upon UV irradiation, although its relative cyclization efficiency was only 0.03 compared to the hexane solution. Cyclization is more effective in amorphous films than polycrystalline films; however, isomerization in the solid state remains less effective compared to hexane solutions. Inefficiency supports that packing structure of the condensed phase influences photoswitching of DAE between open and closed forms [56].Photoswitching of DAE 6a and 6b were investigated in solidstate amorphous films (Fig. 6) prepared by cooling molten samples between two glass plates.

        <p>A simple approach to increasing the free volume of azobenzene molecules in the solid state is functionalization with bulky groups (Fig. 7a), particularly aromatic groups, which breaks the planarity of molecules and prevents their crystallization. As a result, amorphous and uniform films that can cycle between UV and visible light irradiation or thermal reversion were achieved (Fig. 7b). The decrease in planarity of the molecule correlates to increasing free volume available for isomerization. In addition to inducing the disorder of azobenzene films, bulky functional groups also increase the internal steric hindrance of cis metastable isomers compared to trans ground state, in turn, increasing the energy difference between cis and trans states (DH). This is an appealing characteristic for solar thermal fuels (STFs) that store photon energy in strained chemical bonds and release it in the form of thermal energy [24].A simple approach to increasing the free volume of azobenzene molecules in the solid state is functionalization with bulky groups (Fig. 7a), particularly aromatic groups, which breaks the planarity of molecules and prevents their crystallization.

        <p>Another approach to increasing the free volume in the solid state is by binding four azobenzene molecules to a central carbon atom, creating a three-dimensional tetramer (Fig. 8a). The arrangement of the tetramers features enough free volume for successful photoisomerization; upon trans-cis isomerization, thin films change from a porous, crystalline solid phase to a nonporous, amorphous phase. Furthermore, functionalizing at the para positions of the phenyl moieties with alkyl groups increased the porosity of the trans-phase. Compared to the unsubstituted tetramer 8a, both 8b and 8c were able to selectively adsorb CO 2 from an N 2 environment in the entirely trans (E 4 ) form [57].Another approach to increasing the free volume in the solid state is by binding four azobenzene molecules to a central carbon atom, creating a three-dimensional tetramer (Fig. 8a).

Upon irradiation of powder 9 with UV light, the cyanoethyl ligand changes conformation first from the b to a conformation, increasing the unit-cell volume enough to allow trans-cis isomerization of azobenzene ligand. The cis isomer reverts to trans after 24 h in the dark, without changes to the cyanoethyl ligand. For the first time, application of an auxiliary, photoreactive ligand has been shown to enable photoswitching of azobenzenes in the solid state, demonstrating a design strategy for solid-state photochromism through controlling crystal environment [58].A metal complex with an auxiliary photoreactive ligand, cyanoethyl, axial to 4-aminoazobenzene ligand shows an improved photoisomerization in the solid state (Fig. 9).

        <p>Fri s ci c et al. reported irreversible crystal-to-crystal cis-trans isomerization of perhalogenated azobenzene 10a (Fig. 10a), demonstrating permanent modification of a crystal through visible light irradiation (Fig. 10b) which results in highly controllable photomechanical bending. The transition occurs upon irradiation under 457-nm laser light; single crystal cis is transformed into a polycrystalline sample of trans. Perhalogenation stabilizes the cis form of azobenzene, which is inherently hard to isolate in its crystal state. Normally, the half-life of non-halogenated cis-azobenzene derivatives is very brief, ranging from seconds to minutes. Perhalogenation increases the half-lives to approximately two months, allowing accumulation of the cis form required for bending.

        <p>A follow-up report by Fri s ci c et al. discusses a co-crystallization strategy to investigate, for the first time, single crystal cis-trans isomerization of azobenzene through in situ X-ray diffraction. This new approach overcomes many limitations regarding the study and design of azobenzene crystals, such as chromophore variety, synthesis of chromophores, and crystal morphology, as well as difficulty isolating the cis form due to the short half-life. Cocrystals were made using an electron-deficient perfluorinated azobenzene, with highly polarizable iodine acting as the halogen bond donor, and azo-or olefin-based pyridine derivatives (i.e. bpe) as halogen bond acceptors (Fig. 10c). Using single-crystal XRD, (cis-10b)(cisbpe) was transformed to (trans-10b)(cis-bpe) at 532-nm irradiation at 5 mW/cm at 298 K over the course of 3 h (Fig. 10d). Furthermore, by repeating this irradiation with 15 mW/cm at 200 K (presumably to hinder recrystallization) over the course of 1 h, the diffraction pattern disappears, revealing that cis-trans isomerization of perfluorinated azobenzene cocrystals undergo an amorphous phase before recrystallization [60].A follow-up report by Fri s ci c et al. discusses a co-crystallization strategy to investigate, for the first time, single crystal cis-trans isomerization of azobenzene through in situ X-ray diffraction.

        <p>Recently, a hydrazone-based photoswitch featuring robustness, bistability, facile synthesis, and functionality in the solid state was synthesized by Aprahamian et al. (Fig. 11a). The E isomer as a solid-state film did not exhibit changes in the absorption spectrum after one month at room temperature, indicating remarkable thermal stability. Photoswitching between visible light and UV or heat enables switching between the E and Z forms, respectively [61]. In UVevis cycling experiments where photoswitching of films was performed with alternating wavelengths of 360 nm and 450 nm, emission intensity was found to decrease in the first cycle, but remains stable over subsequent cycles. This may be attributed to an annealing effect in which the crystalline Z-isomer reorganizes within the film during the first cycle. The film isomerizes when irradiated with high-intensity blue light (430e470 nm), undergoing a phase transition from the crystalline state to an amorphous state, as evidenced by the disappearance of optical birefringence and fluorescence emission. Along with facile synthesis, high fatigue resistance, reversibility, and fluorescence switching in the solid state, this type of photoswitch is highly desirable as a multifunctional material [62]. Further studies on hydrazones functionalized with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups reveal the importance of free space for successful solidstate photoswitching (Fig. 11b). Thin films of hydrazones functionalized with electron-donating groups were able to switch due to the loose-packed arrangement influenced by the rotary phenyl group shifting out of the plane (Fig. 11c), whereas electron-withdrawing groups directed the hydrazones to pack in a head-to-tail arrangement, minimizing the space available for switching to occur, if at all (Fig. 11d) [63].

        <p>A novel system that induces magnetization switching of paramagnetic complexes through photochromic SO ligands was introduced by Frank et al. This system is unique in that magnetization is not only switchable in solid-state thin films, but that the photomagnetic states possess long lifetimes at temperatures above 300 K. Previous efforts to induce photomagnetic states based on ligand-driven spin-crossover processes were performed in solutions, and solid-state switching was only achieved at temperatures below 200 K. The authors describe the generation of photomagnetic states as a photoisomerization-induced spincharge excited state process (Fig. 12), in which the lifetime of the magnetization state is dictated by the lifetime of the photochromic ligand state. The lifetime of the closed form SO ligand is in the order of seconds, whereas magnetization induced by the direct excitation of the metal-centered excited states only lasts for a few nanoseconds [13].A novel system that induces magnetization switching of paramagnetic complexes through photochromic SO ligands was introduced by Frank et al.

        <p>Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a common backbone functionalized with photoswitches, particularly azobenzenes (see Table 2). A solid-state solar thermal fuel material was achieved by the facile synthesis of an azobenzene-functionalized PMMA (Fig. 13a). The polymer is soluble in many organic solvents, making it easy to process into amorphous thin films. Heat release from the multilayered films during cis-to-trans thermal reversion was imaged using an infrared camera (Fig. 13b). The polymer was also cross-linked by poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PGda), to increase the film thickness by stacking layers, although at the cost of the gravimetric density [22]. Similarly, another example of a PMMA polymer incorporating azobenzene side groups is shown in Fig. 13c. In comparison to the unbound counterpart, these azobenzenes are not as closely packed in the solid state, yet p-p stacking contributes to hindered isomerization. To overcome p-p stacking interactions between the photoswitching moieties, methoxy groups were added to the four ortho positions on the azobenzene phenyl rings, forming PmAzo 13b (Fig. 13c). Ortho-functionalization also led to a bathochromic shift of the trans-cis irradiation wavelength from UV light to blue light, eliminating the use of UV light which has the potential to decay molecules. Amorphous films of 13b were able to take on patterns that were erased with visible light (Fig. 13d). The patterns were retained when films were stored in the dark at room temperature for 32 weeks. The long-term optical contrast of the photopattern is due to a lack of overlap of the n-p* bands between the cis-13b and trans-13b [66].Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a common backbone functionalized with photoswitches, particularly azobenzenes (see Table 2).

        <p>Wu et al. have shown that, by controlling glass transition temperature (T g ) through switching between cis and trans isomers, azopolymers with either PMMA or poly(methyl acrylate) backbones can be reversibly switched between solid and liquid phases (Fig. 13e andf) [67]. For azopolymers 13c-13f, the trans isomer possessed a high T g above room temperature, whereas a low T g below room temperature was characteristic of the cis isomers. According to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements for 13c, the T g is À10 C for the cis isomer and 48 C for the trans isomer. Under alternating UV and visible light irradiation, 13c was shown to undergo complete reversible isomerization for at least five cycles.Wu et al. have shown that, by controlling glass transition temperature (T g ) through switching between cis and trans isomers, azopolymers with either PMMA or poly(methyl acrylate) backbones can be reversibly switched between solid and liquid phases (Fig. 13e andf) [67].

It was observed that polymerbound SP units possess improved reversibility and fatigue resistance upon alternating UV and visible light irradiation when compared to the unbound form doped in a PMMA polymer matrix. It is important to note that the MC moieties experience slower ring closure than ring-opening, demonstrating that the steric hindrance induced by the polyimide backbone may be important in stabilizing the MC form in the solid state [68].SP has been employed as a side chain unit in a polyimide to increase the thermal stability of the structure for high-performance multifunctional memory devices.

        <p>Romdhane et al. previously employed NBD in a polymer system and investigated the system's photochemical properties [69]. It was expected that through pentamethylation, which would introduce bulk and a decreased polarity to the polymer structures, there would be improvements in solubility, film-formation, and photochemical valence isomerization. Indeed, following the synthesis of these derivatives, it was observed that NBD-to-QC photoswitching in a solid-state film could be promoted under sunlight irradiation. The thermal energy released during back conversion was studied by DSC measurement of irradiated polymer films as a potential system for STFs. In addition, the kinetics were found to be first order, and a 90%e95% conversion efficiency was achieved without side reactions. The lack of polymerization side reactions was attributed to steric hindrance from the addition of methyl groups. Along with the presence of a consistent exothermic peak for the conversion of QC to NBD, measured to be around 91e95 kJ/mol, the polymer maintained a consistent glass transition temperature (T g ) through multiple heating cycles, demonstrating that no side polymerization reactions occur, as well as the cyclability of heat release.Romdhane et al. previously employed NBD in a polymer system and investigated the system's photochemical properties [69].

In the solid state, Azo-SWCNTs experience "bundling," in which azobenzene molecules of one scaffold interact with azobenzene molecules of an adjacent scaffold, effectively increasing the functionalization density by a factor of two (Fig. 14a). This introduces additional steric strain, further increasing energy storage density per azobenzene moiety by nearly 200% when compared to their unbound counterpart [23].In order to improve the energy storage density of solid-state photoswitches for STF application, Grossman et al. developed another type of functionalized azobenzene system in which several photoswitching molecules are covalently bound to a rigid singlewall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) scaffold.

        <p>As a demonstration of solid-state STF applications, Luo et al. covalently functionalized SWCNTs with push-pull azobenzenes. The push-pull electronic structure increases the isomerization enthalpy, serving to increase energy storage density, with gravimetric density of the Azo-SWCNT-based films reaching 60.4 Wh/kg, approximately 50% more than that of the free azobenzene derivative (39 Wh/kg). These films remain stable under several irradiation cycles and are shown to possess an energy storage efficiency of 12.4%, showing potential as materials for high-energy, short-term STFs [70].As a demonstration of solid-state STF applications, Luo et al. covalently functionalized SWCNTs with push-pull azobenzenes.

        <p>Imidazole-containing azoheteroarene (i-Azo-h) molecules grafted onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) serves as potential material for photothermal batteries (Fig. 14b). The i-Azo-h/rGO films and powders were shown to have high power density (2380 W/kg and 3280 W/kg, respectively) due to a high-yielding E-Z isomerization (77.2%) and fast Z-E back-isomerization rate (6.1 Â 10 À3 s À1 ) under green light irradiation at 535 nm. Reaction rate is influenced by favorable discharging due to intramolecular push-pull electronic structure. This material was applied to an information coding/encoding display employing thermochromic inks.

        <p>Another approach to improving the stability of the MC isomer in the solid state is by creating an environment that stabilizes both the uncharged and charged SP/MC isomers. A hybrid system consisting of a mixture of organophilic clay and mesoporous silica has been shown to stabilize both the SP and MC forms in the solid state, along with improving the switchability upon visible light discoloration and thermal coloration (Fig. 15). The zwitterionic MC isomer was stabilized by the hydrophilic nature of mesoporous dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS) [72]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as templates for photoswitches have been recognized as potential photoresponsive sensors. Photoswitches such as azobenzene, SP, and DAE have been incorporated into MOFs as linkers of the framework or as guests embedded into the pores [73]. SP molecules normally exhibit poor switchability in the solid state, but having pyridyl groups on both ends enables the SP unit to be spatially separated within the rigid MOF structure for solid-state switching. Pyridyl groups coordinate to the Zn metal centers in the MOFs (Fig. 16a). Linker (16a) incorporating SP molecule exhibits photoisomerization similar to free SP in the solution state, both under UV and visible light irradiation. This behavior indicates isomerization improves when SP molecules have sufficient free volume to change between open and closed forms. Another linker (16b) composed of two SP molecules shows lack of reversibility when embedded in MOFs due to the close packing arrangement of the two photoswitching moieties on each linker. Neither 16a nor 16b linkers were able to photoisomerize under UV irradiation in the solid state (Fig. 16b), corroborating that steric hindrance is a major issue for the photoswitching of SP molecules in the solid state [15].Another approach to improving the stability of the MC isomer in the solid state is by creating an environment that stabilizes both the uncharged and charged SP/MC isomers.

        <p>A mixed Fe(II)/Fe(III) dithiooxalato(dto)-bridged bimetal complex system (Fig. 17a) creates a two-dimensional honeycomb network in which isomerization of the intercalated SP cations has been implied to control the system's magnetic properties. A combination of Fe(II) and Fe(III) was used because the reversible thermally induced charge transfer minimizes free energy in the system. The charge transfer phase transition and ferromagnetism of the 2D honeycomb network is influenced by the size of the intercalated cation, so by employing photoswitchable cationic SP molecules the sizedand therefore the electronic and magnetic propertiesdcan be controlled. Photoisomerization by UV irradiation has been shown to occur both at 70 K (Fig. 17b) and at room temperature, with the latter suppressing charge transfer phase transition and resulting in two ferromagnetic phases, one with a Curie temperature at 5 K corresponding to a low transfer phase and another at 22 K corresponding to high transfer phase [74].A mixed Fe(II)/Fe(III) dithiooxalato(dto)-bridged bimetal complex system (Fig. 17a) creates a two-dimensional honeycomb network in which isomerization of the intercalated SP cations has been implied to control the system's magnetic properties.

        <p>Einaga et al. synthesized FePt nanoparticles coated with azobenzene molecules, which create a system in which magnetic properties are influenced by the changes in the electronic interactions between azobenzene ligands and the nanoparticle cores induced by photoswitching of the azobenzene molecules; particularly the changes are in the electronic polarization of iron d electrons covalently bound to the carboxylate groups of functionalized azobenzene ligands. This is supported by earlier work from the same group, which synthesized g-Fe 2 O 3 composite nanoparticles with covalently bound azobenzene ligands for similar purposes [75,76]. In both cases, photoisomerization is improved when noctylamine was implemented as spacer ligands, increasing the free volume between photoswitches in solid state.

        <p>Another approach to solid-state photoswitching uses polystyrene-based microparticles as a template for SP functionalization (Fig. 19,19g,h). By comparing electronic and kinetic properties with those of its unbound form (19a, b), one can study the impact of solid-state environment on these properties. Progressing across solution (toluene), dispersion (toluene/polystyrene), and solid (polystyrene matrix) states, isomerization of SP to the MC form becomes increasingly restricted for both microparticle-bound and unbound SP molecules, while the degree of restriction was more significant for the unbound system [78].Another approach to solid-state photoswitching uses polystyrene-based microparticles as a template for SP functionalization (Fig. 19,19g,h).

        <p>Another type of hybrid material, developed from the combination of SP/SO molecules and polyoxometalate (POM) systems (Fig. 20), enables excellent solid-state photoswitching at ambient conditions, despite the geometrical constraints experienced by close packing between the photoswitches and the POM units. Due to the isostructural properties of the Mo-POM and W-POM anions, electronic factors were studied without changing the overall structure of the system. It was shown that W-based POMs improve solid-state photoswitching as a result of a better separation of absorption energies between the organic and inorganic moieties compared to its Mo-based counterpart, where Mo competes with the photochromic moieties for absorption of UV light. Further improvements to solid-state photochromism are due to the polar nature of the POM frameworks which stabilizes the zwitterionic MC form. This demonstrates that electronic factors also impact photoisomerization of the SP/POM and SO/POM systems [79].Another type of hybrid material, developed from the combination of SP/SO molecules and polyoxometalate (POM) systems (Fig. 20), enables excellent solid-state photoswitching at ambient conditions, despite the geometrical constraints experienced by close packing between the photoswitches and the POM units.

        <p>Klajn et al. have demonstrated a cage system to allow solidstate photoisomerization of azobenzene [80]. Pristine azobenzene and ortho-tetrafluoro-azobenzene derivative 21b (Fig. 21) were encapsulated within a polyimidazole-Pd cage complex in water, where azobenzene is normally insoluble. Two equivalents of trans-21b were able to enter and remain within the cage (Fig. 21b). Upon UV irradiation, one equivalent converts to cis-21b which forms an unstable heterodimer with the trans isomer. cis-21b is immediately expelled and enters a free cage in solution (Fig. 21c). Changes in color during photoisomerization inspired the investigation of light-induced patterning of hydrogel films soaked in aqueous solution of encapsulated azobenzenes (Fig. 21d ande). Switching was not observed for free azobenzenes in the solid state, supporting the crucial role of the host in enabling photoisomerization.Klajn et al. have demonstrated a cage system to allow solidstate photoisomerization of azobenzene [80].

        <p>Similarly, cocrystals of self-assembled SP and g-cyclodextrin (gCD), SP-COOH@gCD, have been shown to photoisomerize in thin films due to the free volume available in the cavity of gCD. Selfassembly occurs between the carboxylic acid group on the SP molecule and the hydroxy group in gCD, forming a hydrogen bond (Fig. 22a). Hydrogen bonding has shown to be crucial in the formation of 1-dimensional microcrystals in the solid state (Fig. 22b, left) with fluorescence response upon UV irradiation. Furthermore, it was shown that neutralizing the carboxylic acid group on the SP moiety to sodium carboxylate transformed the rod-like microcrystals into a disordered arrangement of clusters (Fig. 22b, right), as observed with scanning electron microscopy [81].Similarly, cocrystals of self-assembled SP and g-cyclodextrin (gCD), SP-COOH@gCD, have been shown to photoisomerize in thin films due to the free volume available in the cavity of gCD.

        <p>Liu et al. set out to study a DAE guest-host complex in the solid state [82] (Fig. 23). The DAE derivative contains a perfluorinated cyclopentene as well as a diarylammonium functional group. Benzylammonium groups bind to 8-crown ether groups functionalized to [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2þ , allowing for the non-covalent interactions between DAE guest moiety and the host. This system shows potential for external optical control of luminescence and F€ orster resonance energy transfer between host and guest, including demonstrated performance as a novel photoerasable fluorescent inks. The absorbance spectra of the closed DAE isomer overlaps with the emission spectra of the Ru-donor host complex, thus quenching the fluorescence from Ru complex (Fig. 23). Notably, the host-guest complex was able to photoswitch more efficiently in solid state (98%) than in solution (90.6%), granted by efficient transfer of energy from the host molecule to DAE. The rate of photoswitching in solid state (9.6 Â 10 À3 s À1 ) was also enhanced compared to that in solution (8.4 Â 10 À3 s À1 ). It is proposed that improved photoswitching in the solid state is due to the fixed antiparallel conformation of DAE during photocyclization.Liu et al. set out to study a DAE guest-host complex in the solid state [82] (Fig. 23).

The heavy platinum atoms serve as markers for distinguishing the photoswitches from the substrate, enabling to track molecular length changes measured between Pt atoms upon photoisomerization. The length change between trans (~2.1 nm) and cis (~1.4 nm) conformations upon UV irradiation of solid-state photoswitches over graphene was measured at atomic resolution. Moreover, light-activated diffusion of photoswitches was observed, along with the temporary cis isomer packing on graphene surface.

        <p>Using atomic force microscopy imaging, photoswitching between cis and trans isomers of AB derivative 24 on a surface of calcite was observed (Fig. 24bee). Unlike metal surfaces, the insulating surface of calcite kinetically traps the cis form upon adsorption, hindering isomerization to the energetically favorable trans isomer. Upon trans-cis-trans isomerization with alternating UV and visible light, it was revealed that 24 on calcite was reversible and only the trans isomer was mobile upon illumination, further supporting that the cis isomer is trapped by calcite. In addition, the cross sections of photoisomerization at 455 nm determined on calcite surfaces (~10 À18 cm À2 ) were at least two orders of magnitude higher than those observed on metal surfaces (&gt;10 À20 cm À2 ) with various wavelengths and comparable to the photoisomerization in solution state (~10 À19 cm À2 ), indicating preservation of switching efficiency and photochromic properties on calcite surface [84].Using atomic force microscopy imaging, photoswitching between cis and trans isomers of AB derivative 24 on a surface of calcite was observed (Fig. 24bee).

        <p>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been used to image switching of films composed of azobenzene derivatives 4-(phenylazo) benzoic acid (PABA) [85,86] and 4-((1,3,5-trimethyl-1Hpyrazol-4-yl)diazenyl) benzoic acid (PyABA) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (Fig. 24fek). STM images show that films for both derivatives are crystalline and consist of dimers. Upon irradiation of UV light (370 nm), it was observed that for both PABA and PyABA, the unsubstituted ring switches away from the surface plane. The carboxyl group provides intermolecular interactions between neighboring molecules that physically keep the cis structures on the surface. It is interesting to note that switching only occurs for alternating rows of dimers in PABA, whereas switching is observed for all molecules in PyABA film [86].Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been used to image switching of films composed of azobenzene derivatives 4-(phenylazo) benzoic acid (PABA) [85,86] and 4-((1,3,5-trimethyl-1Hpyrazol-4-yl)diazenyl) benzoic acid (PyABA) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (Fig. 24fek).

        <p>Azobenzenes have been physisorbed on semiconductors to develop van der Waals heterostructures as a means to realize nanoscale transistors. Using photoswitches, the properties of 2D semiconducting materials can be controlled by light irradiation; however, the persistent photoconductivity effect (PPC), a common occurrence on the interface of 2D semiconducting materials, hinders fast response. By employing a trap-free polymer dielectric as a support for the AZO/MoS 2 hybrid system, the PPC effect was suppressed. Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and IeV measurements revealed that photoswitching of azobenzene molecules adsorbed on the n-type MoS 2 surface was reversible, with the trans form inducing n-type doping compared to the non-functionalized MoS 2 and the cis form inducing p-type doping (Fig. 25a). Azobenzene molecules were also adsorbed onto black phosphorous to develop p-n diodes that were controlled by photoswitching (Fig. 25b).

        <p>DHA/VHF systems have also been applied to solid-state molecular junctions as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold and ITO surfaces. The former was accomplished using an acetylprotected thiolate anchoring group on the meta position of the DHA phenylene unit to reduce surface quenching (Fig. 25c). In addition, application of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films as a soft top-contact enabled in situ photoswitching along with charge transport measurements. It should be noted that DHA-based SAMs showed higher conductivity than VHF-based SAMs, and switching between the two forms was made possible by alternating between UV irradiation and thermal annealing at 70 C. The reason for differences in conductivity arise from the differences in surface morphology. DHA has reduced conformational flexibility compared to VHF; therefore, photoswitching moieties are located close enough to the top contact to contribute to electron transport [88].DHA/VHF systems have also been applied to solid-state molecular junctions as self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold and ITO surfaces.

        <p>A variety of photoswitches and their isomerization dynamics in solid state have been reviewed along with the effective strategies for enhancing the switching probabilities. Because photoisomerization often involves the rotation of molecular structures, the compact environment in solid state and the strong intermolecular interactions significantly limit the structural change. The covalent functionalization of pristine photoswitching cores with bulky substituents or amorphous polymer backbones has been demonstrated to render structural voids within films or powders, which allows for the less hindered isomerization. Various templates including MOFs, carbon nanomaterials, nanoparticles, and nanocages were also introduced as a means to grant rotational freedom to photoswitches within solid platforms. The switches deposited on surface of 2D materials, metals, and insulators were monitored by microscopy techniques to gauge their nanoscale movement and interaction with the underlying substrates. The integration of organic photoswitches with inorganic surfaces presents an opportunity to construct next-generation low-power electronic devices such as light-activated transistors or photodetectors which reversibly operate at the speed of photoswitching. The conformational change in switches will correlate to the electrical output of the ultra-thin devices composed of atomically thin 2D materials and self-assembly monolayer of organic photoswitches.

Another exciting field of opto-spintronics also takes advantage of photoswitching molecules to control quantum systems and thin-film devices.</p>
        <p>Thus, it is envisioned that facile solid-state switching of organic molecules, particularly at the interface with other functional materials, will contribute to the development of new light-controlled materials, switchable devices, and photon energy storage materials. One of the intrinsic challenges in achieving such applications is the limited light penetration or absorption through thick films or bulk materials. The photoisomers often exhibit overlapping light absorption spectra, preventing 100% saturated photostationary state of either isomeric form, even in dilute solution state. In the condensed phase, due to the increased concentration of photoisomers, the light penetration is further limited to micron scale [89], in case of azobenzene materials. The depth of light penetration depends on the spectral separation between the isomers of each compound, which can be improved by the covalent functionalization methods. Some efforts have been dedicated on separating nep* bands of trans and cis isomers of azobenzene by functionalizing ortho positions of core structures with methoxy [90], fluorine [91], and other halide groups [92]. Bridging the ortho positions with ethane group [93] was also reported to increase the spectral separation of each isomer. Based on the current development, it is expected that selective excitation of one isomer over the other will be accomplished by light irradiation, and the generated photoisomer will not hinder the light absorption of the original isomers even in condensed phase. The strategies to shift light absorption spectra and to induce unhindered structural change can be combined to achieve the solid-state bulk materials with high photoswitching capabilities.Thus, it is envisioned that facile solid-state switching of organic molecules, particularly at the interface with other functional materials, will contribute to the development of new light-controlled materials, switchable devices, and photon energy storage materials.

        <p>Other challenges such as low quantum yields of switching for some photoisomers and low thermal stability of metastable isomers will be also addressed by the functionalization of known photoswitching cores or the development of new switch structures. Heteroaryl azobenzenes [94e99], for example, have been recently developed to significantly increase the half-life of metastable cis isomers through the engineering of metastable structures. For the practical solid-state applications, the switching kinetics and efficiency, wavelengths of light for activation, and stability of solid will need to be considered, and the solid-state characterization techniques such as variable-temperature film measurements, in situ heating/light irradiation microscopy, and in situ irradiation calorimetry will be employed to provide real-time observation of solidstate property changes.Other challenges such as low quantum yields of switching for some photoisomers and low thermal stability of metastable isomers will be also addressed by the functionalization of known photoswitching cores or the development of new switch structures.
