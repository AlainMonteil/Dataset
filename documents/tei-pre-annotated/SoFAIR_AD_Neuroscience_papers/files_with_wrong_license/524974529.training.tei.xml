        <p>Fuels are consumed to provide the energy that devices and processes require to perform useful work. 1- 3 The free energy available from a chemical reaction can be harnessed by molecular machines and dissipated to offset work performed, thus preserving the Second Law of Thermodynamics when tasks are carried out through stochastic molecular-level dynamics. 4,5 In this way chemical engines (Fig. 1) 6 transduce energy from chemical fuels and have the potential to power synthetic molecular nanotechnology [7][8][9][10][11][12][13] by driving and sustaining processes out-of-equilibrium. [7][8][9]14 While some synthetic molecular machines use light, 15,16 electrochemistry 17 or transmembrane gradients, 18 chemical fuels provide an attractive alternative energy source (Fig. 2). 19 Although the waste generated in chemical fuel-to-waste reactions must be dealt with (either recycled, as happens with ADP in the cell, or removed, as occurs for water and CO2 with aerobic respiration), chemical fuels are unencumbered by many of the issues faced by powering processes with other forms of energy. Photo-and electrochemistry often produce unstable intermediates, reactive radicals or cause photobleaching, all of which can limit the number of cycles that complex molecules survive for. Furthermore, in contrast to photons, chemical fuels have the potential to be stored and transported, enabling flexible and responsive systems that operate autonomously when and where they are needed. 19,20 Indeed, active organisms that require a high-density energy supply (such as animals) tend to rely exclusively on chemical energy sources, whereas photosynthesising organisms cannot harvest enough energy from sunlight to support powerintensive behaviours, such as rapid movement. The same trend is apparent in technology; lightpowered flight, for example, remains a major engineering challenge. For these and other reasons, while the energy input to biology largely originates from light (via photosynthesis), chemical fuels (such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), Fig. 2A) are the primary mediators of energy used to maintain and sustain the complex nonequilibrium nanotechnology of the cell. 4,20,21 Fig. 1 | Chemically fuelled molecular dynamics.

        <p>The term 'chemical fuel' has been used in the scientific literature in a variety of contexts, often without precise definition. 2 Drawing analogies between macroscopic and molecular-level phenomena is rarely perfect. Nevertheless, in this Review we find it helpful to use 'chemical fuel' to signify out-of-equilibrium reactants that provide the energy that is transduced (through kinetic asymmetry 22 ) by a chemical engine 6 (a reaction network that converts energy from one form to another to perform a task 23 that is separate to, but accompanies, fuel-to-waste conversion, Fig. 1). 'Waste' refers to the products of the reaction as it progresses towards equilibrium (see Box 1). Which of the reactants/products actually corresponds to 'fuel' and which to 'waste' (i.e. the direction of the reaction supplying the energy that is transduced) can, in some circumstances, be reversed (a notable example is ATP synthase); but for any given task 'fuel' indicates the species consumed to power the chemical engine and 'waste' what is produced as a result. These definitions fit well with how these terms are generally used in a biochemical setting. 20 The properties and traits discussed in this Review apply particularly to chemical fuels capable of continuously supplying energy through information ratchet mechanisms 7 (Fig. 2). 1,2 Chemical reactions can also be used to transiently alter thermodynamic minima and kinetically trap responsive systems (for example, with pulse-fuelled (Fig. 5) or sequentially operated systems, Fig. 4A). 2,3,[24][25][26][27] Insights can also be gained from other stimuli-responsive supramolecular systems (Fig. 3), such as dissipative self-assembly [28][29][30][31][32] or micromotors 33 and other fuelled systems, [34][35][36][37] even though kinetic asymmetry 22 is not inherently necessary for their function. 12 (a process analogous to the Fmoc-Cl-fuelled closed pump in B(iii) 10 ).

        <p>However, the fuelling process could not be made repetitious, in part probably because the reagents required to complete the cycle (through decomposition of the carbamate) react rapidly with phosgene such that the fuel-to-waste reaction is not appreciably promoted by the machine. The need to have the fuel react with the machine, and have that machine-fuel conjugate then form the waste and regenerate the machine while completing the mechanical cycle (rather than the fuel simply decomposing to the waste through a background process not involving the machine), is a key problem in generating fuelling reaction cycles.However, the fuelling process could not be made repetitious, in part probably because the reagents required to complete the cycle (through decomposition of the carbamate) react rapidly with phosgene such that the fuel-to-waste reaction is not appreciably promoted by the machine.

        <p>The transient acidic conditions generated by the base-catalysed decarboxylation of electron-poor carboxylic acids has been used to switch the position of a macrocycle in mechanically interlocked molecules (Fig. 5A) 24,25 and to directionally drive motors (Fig. 5B). 26 The operation of such motors requires a pulse of trichloroacetic acid for each 360° rotation or ring displacement to the next equivalent binding site. This inherently synchronises machine dynamics of an ensemble, a feature that may prove useful for correlating the motions within a group of molecular machines. This type of fuel is used in a very different manner to continuously acting (e.g. biochemical) fuels. [1][2][3] The pulsed acid fuel transiently changes the environment (and thus binding site preference and barrier lability), statistically biasing machine dynamics through an energy ratchet mechanism. 7 In contrast to information ratchet mechanisms, the interaction of the fuel with the machine does not give rise to kinetic asymmetry in the chemomechanical cycle (see Box 1). 2 Transient base conditions have also been generated with a pulsed-fuel 27 and have been used to temporarily switch the position of a macrocycle in a rotaxane, analagous to the process involving decarboxylative transient acids. 24,25The transient acidic conditions generated by the base-catalysed decarboxylation of electron-poor carboxylic acids has been used to switch the position of a macrocycle in mechanically interlocked molecules (Fig. 5A) 24,25 and to directionally drive motors (Fig. 5B). 26 The operation of such motors requires a pulse of trichloroacetic acid for each 360° rotation or ring displacement to the next equivalent binding site.

        <p>ATP is a ubiquitous chemical fuel in biology, generally hydrolysed by biomolecular machines to generate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2A). 4,20,51,52 At first glance its structural complexity is rather striking, as hydrolysis of almost any phosphate could, in principle, release similar amounts of free energy. 51 However, the nucleoside (and length of the triphosphate region) serves as a recognition unit, allowing biocatalysts to bind this substrate specifically and hydrolyse a single phosphate unit (in some circumstances a second phosphate unit can also be hydrolysed). 20 The triphosphate group's charge reduces its susceptibility to direct hydrolysis. 20,52 In addition to ATP, biology employs a range of other fuels to drive specific metabolic processes, such as guanosine triphosphate (GTP), creatine phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NADH/NADPH) and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). 20 This structural diversity allows fuels to be tailored for specific applications. Recognition elements enable fuels to be matched with the machines they drive so they can be targeted to specific processes without interference. For example, GTP orthogonally fuels microtubule assembly 53 that ATP-fuelled motor proteins (such as dynein, Fig. 2A) subsequently walk along. 54 Complementary base pairing likewise allows high specificity in the fuelling of artificial DNAbased machines. [45][46][47]55 The incorporation of recognition motifs, and/or orthogonal chemistries, represents an opportunity to improve the performance and utility of the activated Fmoc 10,11 and carbodiimide 12 fuels for synthetic molecular machines, which to date have lacked such structural elements. A recent carbodiimide fuelled rotary motor (Fig. 2C(ii)) uses a chiral fuel to generate kinetic asymmetry through diastereomeric interactions with the motor. 13 Better expression of this diastereomeric relationship (by optimising the chirality of the fuel to the stereochemistry of the motormolecule conformers) may improve the directionality of the fuelled operation of such machines.ATP is a ubiquitous chemical fuel in biology, generally hydrolysed by biomolecular machines to generate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2A). 4,20,51,52 At first glance its structural complexity is rather striking, as hydrolysis of almost any phosphate could, in principle, release similar amounts of free energy. 51 However, the nucleoside (and length of the triphosphate region) serves as a recognition unit, allowing biocatalysts to bind this substrate specifically and hydrolyse a single phosphate unit (in some circumstances a second phosphate unit can also be hydrolysed). 20 The triphosphate group's charge reduces its susceptibility to direct hydrolysis. 20,52 In addition to ATP, biology employs a range of other fuels to drive specific metabolic processes, such as guanosine triphosphate (GTP), creatine phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NADH/NADPH) and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). 20 This structural diversity allows fuels to be tailored for specific applications.

        <p>Despite the structural diversity of biochemical fuels, a common feature is their requirement for additional reactants in the fuel-to-waste reaction; 20 biological fuels are reasonably kinetically stable and do not rapidly decompose under physiological conditions in the absence of a catalyst. This contrasts with the activated-Fmoc fuels in Fig. 2B that undergo background reactions that significantly compete with the machine pathway. 10,11 Generally, hydrolysis or oxidation occurs in biochemical fuelling reactions, with water or oxygen effectively acting as a required second component of the fuel. 20 The abundance and availability of water and oxygen within cells is doubtless important for their role as partners in fuelling reactions, circumventing the need for additional complex organic molecular fuels.Despite the structural diversity of biochemical fuels, a common feature is their requirement for additional reactants in the fuel-to-waste reaction; 20 biological fuels are reasonably kinetically stable and do not rapidly decompose under physiological conditions in the absence of a catalyst.

        <p>Autonomous molecular machines act as catalysts for the fuel-to-waste reaction and harness the energy it provides. 1,2,12 Ideally, the background reaction rate should be zero, allowing the machine to use fuel at any rate without wasting energy stored in the fuel. However, this is not practical as all spontaneous reactions have an uncatalysed rate, however slow, 56 and it may be more difficult to optimise a machine to act as a good enough catalyst to utilise the energy from very slow processes when a fast response is needed. Instead, a balance needs to be found between catalytic efficiency (see Box 1) 50 and the overall rate of fuel use.

        <p>Biology has evolved strategies to cope with the kinetic lability of fuels and optimise the balance between catalytic efficiency and rate of fuel consumption. Multiple levels of energy storage are used, each with different associated energies and rates for the fuel-to-waste reaction. 20 Particularly kinetically stable molecules, such as lipids and carbohydrates, provide a long-term energy store, but release large quantities of energy when oxidised. 20 However, these molecules are generally not suitable as fuels for directly driving molecular machines. Instead the energy is converted to a lower energy, more accessible and controllable form, often ATP. 4,20 The kinetic stability of the fuel is generally matched with the process for which it is required; faster processes require less kinetically stable fuel molecules, such as creatine phosphate which fuels myosin motor proteins in muscles. 20 The relatively high background fuel-to-waste reactions of readily accessible fuels, such as ATP, render them unsuitable for storing energy for longer than a few minutes.Biology has evolved strategies to cope with the kinetic lability of fuels and optimise the balance between catalytic efficiency and rate of fuel consumption.

        <p>To maximise catalytic efficiency, the concentration of ATP in cells is generally kept relatively low (1-10 M). 58 This concentration is maintained by replenishing the fuel, by synthesising it on demand. 59 Consequently, the background rate can be kept to a minimum and fuel is provided just fast enough to be used by the machine. Moreover, compartmentalisation means that conditions can be tuned and fuel localised to where it is required. 60,61 Through the use of high fidelity recognition motifs, DNA fuel strands can show excellent selectivity in reacting when DNA walkers reveal specific toeholds on the track, 62 leading to low background rates of unproductive fuel decomposition. 45,46 Alternatively, duplex formation between a fuel strand and a DNA machine can be used to activate a fuel to enzymatic hydrolysis 47 (Fig. 2D), a catalytic process reminiscent of the role of biological cofactors. While synthetic small-molecule motors have not yet matched the sophistication of their biological counterparts as catalysts, parallels are beginning to emerge. The carbodiimide fuelled machines (Fig. 2C) 12 use a more kinetically stable fuel molecule (under machine operation conditions) than the Fmoc-Cl motor 10 (Fig. 2B), and consequently up to 97% of the carbodiimide fuel reacts via the machine-catalysed pathway 12,13 compared to &lt;10% in the case of the Fmoc-Cl fuel. 10 The lack of kinetic stability of the activated Fmoc fuels is an issue for the operation of both the activated Fmoc fuelled motor (Fig. 2B(i),(ii)) 10 and pump (Fig. 2B(iii)). 11 Changing from Fmoc-Cl to Fmoc-nitrophenol-carbonate improves catalytic efficiency, however the high background fuel-to-waste rate (in the presence of base) is best addressed by slow continuous addition of fuel into the reaction vessel, in analogy to the on-demand replenishing of biological fuels. 59,63 Chemical catalysis can be productively coupled with mechanical transitions to create a chemomechanical cycle. 1,2,22 To maximize the effectiveness of such a cycle the mechanically exchangeable (co-)conformers should kinetically favour different transformations within the catalytic cycle so that the optimal catalytic pathway passes through all mechanical (co-)conformers. 22 For example, one (co-)conformer may favour reacting with the fuel, while another may favour elimination of waste, generating kinetic asymmetry in the cycle (Fig. 1). Therefore, in order to most rapidly catalyse the fuel-to-waste reaction, the motor is driven between (co-)conformers, 64,65 an action reminiscent of the challenges faced by switchable catalysts. 66 These pathways inherently generate chemical gating within a system and, coupled with appropriate mechanical gating, form the chemical engine 6 that drives molecular motors (see definitions Box 1).To maximise catalytic efficiency, the concentration of ATP in cells is generally kept relatively low (1-10 M). 58 This concentration is maintained by replenishing the fuel, by synthesising it on demand. 59 Consequently, the background rate can be kept to a minimum and fuel is provided just fast enough to be used by the machine.

        <p>Burnt bridges mechanisms, used by most DNA walkers, 45,46 destroy the track behind the machine, preventing backward steps. However, directional motion can also be produced by non-destructive means by having the rates of the fuelling and waste-removal reactions vary according to the mechanical state of the machine (kinetic asymmetry). 1,[10][11][12]22,47 This occurs with the majority of biological motors that move along tracks 4,21 and requires anisotropy in the machine structure. 10,12,42 For catenane and rotaxane-based small-molecule motors, anisotropy has been introduced by nonequidistant positioning of the catalytic site between macrocycle binding sites on the track. 10,12 Biased displacement in the forward direction occurs by fuel addition being favoured when the macrocycle is far from the catalytic site (the distal position), the added fuel blocking subsequent backwards movement, and waste removal (re-allowing passage of the macrocycle) being favoured from a site proximal to the macrocycle. For the single bond rotary motor (Fig. 2C(ii)), anisotropy is generated through diastereomeric relationships between the rotamers of the machine and chiral reagents. 13 Directionality arises from kinetic gating-that is the ratio of rates or the difference in transition state energies (G ‡ ), of the fuelling and waste-forming reactions depending on the mechanical state of the machine, resulting in kinetic asymmetry. 1,2,4,22 There is plenty of scope for the structures of both the fuel and the machine to significantly affect this ratio.Burnt bridges mechanisms, used by most DNA walkers, 45,46 destroy the track behind the machine, preventing backward steps.

        <p>Strong coupling has important consequences. Motors transduce chemical energy (from the fuel) to mechanical energy through movement. However, when a strongly coupled motor is forced backwards the mechanical energy can be converted into chemical energy as the motor takes the waste products and synthesises the fuel. 4 Although macroscopically counterintuitive (a car does not make gasoline when pushed backwards!), this is a kinetically more probable pathway than the nanoscale machine moving without fuel or using fuel to move backwards. This is how F1F0-ATP synthase manufactures ATP: 4 a transmembrane proton gradient forces the strongly coupled ATP-driven motor in reverse, and in doing so drives the waste-to-fuel chemical reaction, synthesising ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.Strong coupling has important consequences.

The complexity of biological systems makes it unclear which of these selection pressures are more important than others. This may become more apparent once synthetic fuel and molecular machine designs become more sophisticated.Most biological molecular motors (kinesin, dynein, myosin, bacterial flagellum) are not strongly coupled. 4,22,73,74 Instead, these weakly coupled motors appear to be optimised for other performance criteria rather than perfect directionality. 5,70 These include maximising rate and efficiency while working against an external load, faster fuel use (and thus faster machine operation and task performance), decreased structural complexity, greater stability and greater flexibility.

        <p>Synthetic molecular machines are currently far from achieving the kinetic gating rate ratios found in biological systems (Table 1). Furthermore, the fuel-to-waste reactions currently used for synthetic molecular machines deliver a much higher free energy release than ATP hydrolysis. Hydration of carbodiimides has a free energy release of Gfuel-to-waste ≈ 80 kJ mol -1 , 75 while activated Fmoc decomposition is higher still (Gfuel-to-waste &gt;&gt; 100 kJ mol -1 ), with a significant entropic contribution as a result of each fuel molecule being converted into three waste molecules. With these values, the strong coupling threshold is ~2 × 10 14 :1 for carbodiimides (at 20 ˚C) and &gt;7 × 10 17 :1 for activated Fmoc fuels (at 20 ˚C). Since it is unlikely that such effective kinetic gating can be achieved, a more realistic option to improve thermodynamic efficiency and explore synthetic strongly coupled systems will be to develop lower energy fuel-to-waste reactions that match kinetic gating ratios that are more readily accessible for synthetic molecular machinery (Table 1).Synthetic molecular machines are currently far from achieving the kinetic gating rate ratios found in biological systems (Table 1).

        <p>There are two types of waste that need to be considered for chemically fuelled molecular machines: waste chemicals and waste heat. Chemical waste products can disrupt a system by altering conditions such as pH. For example, one of the three molecules that Fmoc-Cl releases in its waste-forming reaction is HCl (Fig. 2B), which requires neutralisation in order for the amine (required to decompose the Fmoc-ester in the fuelled state of the motor) to remain reactive. Alternatively, binding/interacting of waste with the machine can impede its operation through product inhibition or allosteric binding, 76 for instance, hydrolysed waste oligonucleotides can competitively bind to DNA machines. [45][46][47] For low energy fuel-to-waste reactions, such as ATP hydrolysis, 77 the accumulation of waste can significantly reduce the chemical potential gradient for the fuel-to-waste reaction, which is the very energy source that the molecular machines harvest.There are two types of waste that need to be considered for chemically fuelled molecular machines: waste chemicals and waste heat.

        <p>Biology has evolved sophisticated waste management solutions. One important strategy is the recycling of ADP and phosphate waste to regenerate ATP. 59 Consequently, ATP is a regenerable mediator of energy rather than a single-use fuel. This allows organisms to keep the quantity of ATP and ADP + inorganic phosphate far below what would be required without recycling. 78 Non-recyclable waste products are actively transported out of cells and circulatory systems in larger organisms to keep waste concentrations low. Similar effects have been achieved for synthetic systems, by using dialysis to remove the waste products of ATP hydrolysis, which acted as a stimulus to control supramolecular polymerisation, 76,79 a strategy that may be extendable to fuel-driven artificial molecular machines.Biology has evolved sophisticated waste management solutions.

        <p>Currently, however, synthetic fuel systems generally have no sophisticated strategies for waste removal and rely on particular properties to limit the build-up of by-products, such as the insolubility of urea waste from carbodiimide fuels or the evolution of gaseous CO2 waste from Fmoc fuels. 76 Appealingly, trichloroacetic acid, used as a pulsed-fuel to generate transient acid conditions (Fig. 5B), forms only chloroform (a solvent) and carbon dioxide (a gas) as waste products, neither of which would be expected to be detrimental to the operation of most molecular machines.Currently, however, synthetic fuel systems generally have no sophisticated strategies for waste removal and rely on particular properties to limit the build-up of by-products, such as the insolubility of urea waste from carbodiimide fuels or the evolution of gaseous CO2 waste from Fmoc fuels. 76 Appealingly, trichloroacetic acid, used as a pulsed-fuel to generate transient acid conditions (Fig. 5B), forms only chloroform (a solvent) and carbon dioxide (a gas) as waste products, neither of which would be expected to be detrimental to the operation of most molecular machines.</p>

        <p>Higher temperatures increase the rate of chemical and mechanical steps but may reduce selectivity and accelerate undesirable side reactions. Many biochemical systems are optimised to function at ~37 ˚C, probably balancing these two factors. Waste heat can be useful for maintaining ideal reaction conditions, as demonstrated by warm blooded animals that use ~60% of the waste heat from metabolic processes to maintain body temperature. 70,80 Sophisticated thermostasis mechanisms have evolved to deal with residual waste heat. 81 However, synthetic systems need not be restricted in the same way due to the availability of external cooling and heating methods. Sub-zero temperatures can be used with operating environments other than water, potentially allowing improved directionality. Conversely, hotter temperatures could be employed for applications where speed rather than directionality is important.Higher temperatures increase the rate of chemical and mechanical steps but may reduce selectivity and accelerate undesirable side reactions.

        <p>The second is to learn from the structures and mechanisms of working devices that already exist. With macroscopic machinery, early humans had no choice but to take the former approach and it took millennia to achieve the current levels of mastery over Newtonian mechanics. Unfortunately, these hardwon macroscopic engineering insights do not translate to machinery at the nanoscale. However, in biology we have an example of a working molecular nanotechnology and appreciating why different components have the characteristics, properties and functions they do can provide a short cut to understanding how (and, perhaps, why) to construct artificial machinery that functions at that length scale. 82 The chemical fuels developed to date for artificial molecular machinery are still rudimentary. A consideration of their mechanisms, along with the properties and roles of biological fuels, offers an opportunity to inform the design of new fuel molecules. A fuel mismatched to a machine or task will be wasteful if the fuel's rate of background decomposition is fast compared to the process it is powering, or if it does not induce a strong directional bias, or if it releases substantially more energy than the task requires. Synthetic fuels can potentially be tailored to specific task requirements 20,70 or be appropriated from other fields that also use chemical engines, such as dissipative assembly (Fig. 3). 2,3,6,32,76,83 The invention of low energy fuels for small-molecule machines would open the possibility of currently inaccessible behaviour brought about by strong coupling 4 . 'Designer fuels' with recognition elements incorporated into the fuel structure could likely improve both catalysis and kinetic gating. 12 Compartmentalisation 58,84,85 would facilitate management of fuel activation, reaction concentration and waste removal, 76,86 as well as providing more stable energy storage molecules to act as free-energy reservoirs. Many of these features appear to be within reach using established chemical concepts and methodologies. In the longer term, systems that use orthogonal or cooperative fuels may prove more difficult to design, 54,87 and sophisticated behaviour such as allosteric binding 88 might be necessary to fully emulate complex functions such as cell signalling pathways.
