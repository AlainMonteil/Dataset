        <p>Combining insights from research on signalling and parochial cooperation, we incorporate a trust game with signalling in an agent-based model to study the dynamics of signalling norm emergence in groups with conflicting interests. Our results show that costly signalling norms emerge from random acts of signalling in minority groups that benefit most from parochial cooperation. Majority groups are less likely to develop costly signalling norms. Yet, norms that prescribe sending costless group identity signals can easily emerge in groups of all sizes -albeit, at times, at the expense of minority group members. Further, the dynamics of signalling norm emergence differ across signal costs, relative group sizes, and levels of ingroup assortment. Our findings provide theoretical insights into norm evolution in contexts where groups develop identity markers in response to environmental challenges that put their interests at odds with the interests of other groups. Such contexts arise in zones of ethnic conflict or during contestations of existing power relations.Combining insights from research on signalling and parochial cooperation, we incorporate a trust game with signalling in an agent-based model to study the dynamics of signalling norm emergence in groups with conflicting interests.

        <p>We test the conjecture that such norms emerge as outcomes of signalling games [3][4][5][6] in contexts where groups could benefit from parochial cooperation -i.e., cooperation with members of one's own group. The resulting signalling norms prescribe behaviours that mark individuals' belonging to a certain group, thereby helping distinguish between ingroup "friends" with aligned interests and outgroup "foes" with opposing interests [4,5]. We build on insights from literatures on costly signalling and parochial cooperation to shed light on the emergence of social norms prescribing the displaying of signs of group belonging.We test the conjecture that such norms emerge as outcomes of signalling games [3][4][5][6] in contexts where groups could benefit from parochial cooperation -i.e., cooperation with members of one's own group.

        <p>Research on signalling has shown that costly behaviours that signal individuals' cooperative intent can be part of an (evolutionary stable) Nash equilibrium and enable observers of these signals to distinguish between cooperators and defectors [3,[6][7][8][9][10][11]. These signals are reliable if only cooperators can afford to send them, either because cooperators incur lower signalling costs or gain higher cooperation benefits compared to untrustworthy defectors [12]. While some have suggested that norms prescribing costly signalling can emerge from arbitrary behaviours introduced by a single individual [4], others have indicated that more substantial "shocks" are needed to shift a population from a non-signalling to a signalling equilibrium [3,8]. At the same time, literature on parochial cooperation has shown that cooperation conditional on group belonging emerges and persists in the presence of inter-group competition or conflict [13,14] within groups of relatively small sizes [15]. This strand of literature has mostly assumed that cooperation can be conditioned on apparent innate features (i.e., conspicuous physical characteristics) that double as markers of group identity that are hard to fake [15][16][17][18][19].Research on signalling has shown that costly behaviours that signal individuals' cooperative intent can be part of an (evolutionary stable) Nash equilibrium and enable observers of these signals to distinguish between cooperators and defectors [3,[6][7][8][9][10][11].

        <p>We bring together similar -albeit often differently conceptualized -concepts from these two literatures to understand the conditions that favour the emergence of signalling norms as facilitators of parochial cooperation [5,20]. Following the literature on parochial cooperation, we put the emphasis on intergroup conflict and the resulting need to identify ingroup members and cooperate conditional on group identity. In line with the literature on signalling, we operationalize indicators of group identity as symbolic -and often costly -markers that can, but do not have to, be displayed by individuals [21,22]. In particular, we build on the trust game with signalling previously introduced to derive hypotheses about the emergence of signalling norms [5] and incorporate it in an agent-based model. Our agent-based model allows us to study the dynamics of norm emergence and parochial cooperation that intergroup conflict may bring about.We bring together similar -albeit often differently conceptualized -concepts from these two literatures to understand the conditions that favour the emergence of signalling norms as facilitators of parochial cooperation [5,20].

        <p>Our research question is: Under what conditions do signalling norms emerge to facilitate parochial cooperation? Imagine two large hunter-gatherer bands that are in conflict over limited resources in their shared habitat [23]. A group that has spent a very long time hunting away from their band is coming home and approaching one of the settlements. Others in this band might want to welcome the hunters, hoping for a share in the kill. Yet, as the group has been away for so long, the band cannot as easily recognize which band this particular group belongs to. If they are from the same band, the incoming hunters will be cooperative; if they are from another band, the group might have come to raid the settlement instead. To prevent being mistaken for members of an enemy group and win the trust of their band, the approaching group of hunters can display a reliable sign of band belonging, such as a difficult to fake local dialect or a tattoo with group-specific features [24]. Once the band members recognize that this signal corresponds to their own group, they can rest assured and welcome the arrivals; otherwise, they can play safe and stay away from interacting with the group of strangers that is approaching their settlement.Our research question is: Under what conditions do signalling norms emerge to facilitate parochial cooperation?

        <p>In particular, we test the hypothesis that, in contexts where an outgroup is frequently encountered -such as in zones of ethnic conflict [20,25,26], prisons with rival gangs [27,28] or during contestations of existing power relations [29,30] -group members will be more willing to invest considerable resources in costly displays of group belonging [3,5,20,31,32]. We call behaviours that change or reinforce observers' beliefs about someone's belonging to a social group signalling norms [5]. We consider signals that are hard to fake (for instance, because they require inaccessible group-specific knowledge) and cannot be discriminated against by the outgroup (for example, because they are unknown to them [33,34]). We first provide analytical results on the conditions under which signal display and recognition can be preferred strategies of group members. We then employ agent-based simulations to understand how likely random changes in individual behaviours are to push populations from a non-signalling state into a state where the display of signals and their recognition are widely adopted -and the signalling norm is accepted [4]. Finally, we relax several model assumptions to understand an even broader range of conditions that favour the emergence of signalling norms.In particular, we test the hypothesis that, in contexts where an outgroup is frequently encountered -such as in zones of ethnic conflict [20,25,26], prisons with rival gangs [27,28] or during contestations of existing power relations [29,30] -group members will be more willing to invest considerable resources in costly displays of group belonging [3,5,20,31,32].

        <p>Our study contributes to the literature on norm emergence and change in multiple ways. First, our agent-based model enhances our understanding of how signalling norms can solve trust dilemmas often arising in real-world exchange situations [12]. Second, we show that norms prescribing costly signalling of group identity can emerge and facilitate parochial cooperation in minority groups from initial conditions without signalling and signal recognition. Third, we show how costless signals of group identity support parochial cooperation in groups of all sizes. We thereby reveal a crucial difference in the dynamics of signalling trait emergence between norms of sending costly and costless signals. Fourth, we discuss how signalling norm emergence becomes more challenging for minority groups if signals can be recognized by the outgroup or there is significant noise in perceptions of an individual's group identity. Our findings shed light on various real-life situations, such as how dialects [35] or specific types of scars [22] can be used to distinguish between ethnic groups in contexts of ethnic conflict or resource competition.Our study contributes to the literature on norm emergence and change in multiple ways.

        <p>Further work in this domain can help understand how groups coordinate on specific signalling norms in similar contexts, and how established signalling norms can hamper cooperation between groups once intergroup conflict is resolved.Further work in this domain can help understand how groups coordinate on specific signalling norms in similar contexts, and how established signalling norms can hamper cooperation between groups once intergroup conflict is resolved.</p>
        <p>We incorporate the trust game with signalling [5] in an agent-based model to map the boundary conditions for the emergence of signalling norms and their impact on individual and group outcomes. The trust game (Figure S1) is a sequential game where one individual (the truster) chooses whether or not to trust the other individual (the trustee), who then decides whether to honour or abuse that trust [36]. In the trust game with signalling, the trustee can signal their identity to the truster before the truster makes a decision on whether to trust the trustee. 1 Using a trust game to study the emergence of signalling has two main advantages over using other games such as the prisoner's dilemma. First, the trust game models sequential decisions which are characteristic of many real-word interactions (e.g., market exchanges or hiring decisions).We incorporate the trust game with signalling [5] in an agent-based model to map the boundary conditions for the emergence of signalling norms and their impact on individual and group outcomes.

        <p>Second, in the trust game, player roles are not interchangeable and payoffs are, therefore, asymmetric. Both the sequential nature and asymmetry of the trust game allow us to attach behaviour to either trust or cooperation; which is unlike simultaneous-move and symmetric dilemmas (such as prisoner's dilemma), where it is unclear whether it is fear or greed that drives behaviour [39].Second, in the trust game, player roles are not interchangeable and payoffs are, therefore, asymmetric.

        <p>We adopt the trust game with signalling [5] to model exchange relations between members of two groups with conflicting interests (Figure S2). We set the payoffs such that a trustee always has an incentive to honour the trust of an ingroup truster and abuse the trust of an outgroup truster. Hence, trusting an ingroup trustee results in a payoff of RI for both parties [25], whereas trusting an outgroup trustee results in a payoff of S for the truster and T for the trustee. If trust is not given, there is no exchange and both parties receive payoff P. The payoffs are ordered as follows: RI &gt; T &gt; RO &gt; P &gt; S. RO denotes the payoff of both parties if a trustee honours the trust of an outgroup truster. By setting RI &gt; T &gt; RO, we hard-code the conflicting group interests into our 1 Trust game with signalling resembles the hostage trust game [37][38][39]. model, so that trustees do not have an incentive to honour outgroup trusters' trust. This allows us to examine the role of signalling in contexts where, for instance, environmental constraints make capturing resources from neighbouring groups attractive [23,28]. In our model, trustees can pay a cost c to signal their group identity and trusters can condition their trust on these signals.We adopt the trust game with signalling [5] to model exchange relations between members of two groups with conflicting interests (Figure S2).

        <p>In this section, we outline the conditions under which trusters consider group identity signals and trustees bear the costs of sending them. Individuals are first assigned a role of a truster or a trustee at random and then randomly matched with another individual of the opposite role. An individual will meet a member of their ingroup with a probability α that is equal to the share of this group in the total population (pi where i ∈ {1, 2} refers to either of two groups). We build on the suggestion that, the lower the probability of encountering ingroup members, the more likely a group is to develop a signalling norm [5]. More precisely, with α ≤ α* (in our setup: minority groups) trusters encounter their ingroup so rarely that they are best off distrusting any trustee in the absence of signalling. With α &gt; α* (majority groups), trusters encounter their ingroup frequently enough to prefer trusting any trustee in the absence of signalling (Eq. 1 and 2 in Supplementary Material). In Theorem 1 below, we establish the conditions necessary for the equilibrium where, within a group, all group members signal and conditionally trust (i.e., give trust conditional on having observed the ingroup's signal). In Theorem 2, we establish the existence of an equilibrium without signalling and signal recognition. We provide proofs and the full analysis in Section S1 of the Supplementary Material. Finally, we define signalling norm emergence as the process during which a group in a non-signalling equilibrium moves to a signalling equilibrium. 2 This could be because trustees acquire additional information about trusters after their signalling decision is made (e.g., the group from our example in the Introduction recognizes, by its appearance, the village they are approaching only after having decided to display a signal of their group identity) or because the truster reveals their group membership by the act of giving trust (e.g., by using a specific dialect when addressing the trustee).In this section, we outline the conditions under which trusters consider group identity signals and trustees bear the costs of sending them.

        <p>Agents in our model have two main traits that determine their strategy in each of the roles they can assume in the game: the signalling and the trusting trait. The signalling trait determines whether an agent signals their group identity at a predefined cost c when acting as a trustee. We vary signalling costs to capture a range of different behaviours that can convey information about group membership. The trusting trait defines whether an agent will, in the role of a truster, trust unconditionally, distrust unconditionally, or trust conditionally (upon having recognized a signal of their ingroup). There are six possible strategies resulting from different combinations of these two traits.Agents in our model have two main traits that determine their strategy in each of the roles they can assume in the game: the signalling and the trusting trait.

        <p>We simulate a population of 500 agents randomly assigned to group 1 with probability p1 and group 2 with probability p2 = (1 -p1). Group sizes and memberships are held fixed. Agents assume the role of a truster or a trustee with equal probability in each round and are then matched with another agent of the opposite role with whom they play the trust game once (if without a match, an agent sits out the round). As in our theoretical model, the probability of meeting one's ingroup α is equal to the share of ingroup p in the population. Additionally, we introduce parameter φ capturing assortative matching with regard to group membership: the probability of meeting the ingroup, holding p fixed, increases with φ. In our agent-based model α, thus, depends on both p and φ. 3 Agents cannot select whom they are matched with and have no memory of past encounters. Such a setup helps us model scenarios where group members frequently interact with strangers, which is a rather adverse environment for the evolution of parochial cooperation [40].We simulate a population of 500 agents randomly assigned to group 1 with probability p1 and group 2 with probability p2 = (1 -p1).

        <p>We set the trust game payoffs such that α* = 0.43 (see Figure 1 for payoffs and Supplementary Material for α* calculation).

        <p>We introduce random mutations of agents' traits with probability mo, and vary this value to capture different propensities of agents to introduce new behaviours with regard to identity signalling [41]. After playing a trust game, agents can update their strategies by observing and copying both of the traits of their more successful ingroup members in a mechanism resembling social learning [42,43] 4 and, thereafter, can also undergo a random mutation to one of their traits. We simulate the evolution of agent traits for 20 000 time steps, evaluating each combination of parameters (see Table S3) in twenty independently initialized simulation runs. Figure 1 gives an overview of the full simulation procedure. Finally, we also run reference simulations for 2 500 time steps 4 Agents compare their weighted payoffs from the last twenty rounds to the equivalent payoffs of a randomly chosen ingroup agent in the same role who has played a comparable number of games; the more successful the model agent, the more likely the focal agent is to adopt their traits (see Section S3.1 in the Supplementary Material). We exclude learning from the outgroup since the two groups' interests are in conflict.We introduce random mutations of agents' traits with probability mo, and vary this value to capture different propensities of agents to introduce new behaviours with regard to identity signalling [41].

        <p>In Panel A of Figure 2, we show the expectations regarding signalling norm emergence according to our formal analysis (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 and Section S1.2 of the Supplementary Material). In Panel B, we show the results of our agent-based simulations. 5 Panel B shows the prevalence of the signalling norm (i.e., agent strategy including both a signalling and a conditionally trusting trait) within each group averaged across the last 100 rounds of simulations. Henceforth, we refer to groups with p &lt; 0.5 as minority groups, and groups with p &gt; 0.5 as majority groups. For ease of interpretation, we focus on cases when φ = 0.5 (therefore, αi = pi) unless stated otherwise. As we predict based on our analytical results, minority groups develop signalling norms (as β ≥ 0) when signal costs are low enough. 6 For example, when c = 1 and random mutations are high (mo = 0.001) almost all minority groups fully develop a signalling norm (second row in Panel B, upper tick on the Y axis). In minority groups, trusters are indifferent between distrusting unconditionally and trusting upon observing the signal (Eq. 1). Thus, if a few trustees start signalling (following a random mutation), they are likely to encounter trusters who have started -and continued -conditionally trusting frequently enough to reap the benefits of parochial cooperation. These benefits offset the costs of signalling, allowing social learning to spread both signalling and conditional trusting in the group. However, when c &gt; 1, groups with α ≤ 0.2 cannot afford to send signals. 7 Furthermore, if mutation rates are low (mo = 0.0001), the signalling norm spreads more slowly and does not become as widely adopted (also see next sub-section).In Panel A of Figure 2, we show the expectations regarding signalling norm emergence according to our formal analysis (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 and Section S1.2 of the Supplementary Material).

        <p>Trusters in these groups are unconditionally trusting and only willing to condition their trusting behaviour on a signal if the share of signalling trustees is sufficiently high (Eq. 2). Therefore, even if some trustees do start signalling, social learning is likely to bring any trusters who start conditionally trusting back to unconditional trust instead; in turn, as long as the share of conditionally trusting trusters remains too low (Eq. 3), the number of trustees willing to bear the costs of sending signals will remain low as well. 8 Yet, when signals are costless (c = 0), trustees who start signalling will have no incentive to stop doing so and signalling can spread through social learning. This, in turn, makes conditional trusting more attractive for trusters and establishes the signalling norm in some majority groups as long as their α is sufficiently low (otherwise, a very large share of signalling is needed for conditional trust to proliferate) and the random mutations are sufficiently high (topmost row in Panel B of Figure 2). Figure 2 also shows that smaller minority groups adopt signalling more, and larger minority groups less, at higher levels of assortment (i.e., as their α increases, see also Figure 2A and Table S2 for easier interpretation). We find that, overall, groups with similar α values stemming from different combinations of p and φ develop comparable shares of the signalling and conditional trusting strategy (Figure S6).

        <p>Overall, groups that develop a (costly) signalling norm are better off than they were in the absence of signalling (see Panel A of Figure S7 for the average payoffs obtained by agents within each group compared to a non-signalling baseline scenario). Yet, while a group's signalling and conditionally trusting behaviours are not dependent on the outgroup's strategies in our model, changes in outgroup trait distributions still affect group payoffs. For instance, despite obtaining benefits from establishing parochial cooperation with the help of signals, minority groups net losses when signals are costless (c = 0). This is due to the fact that the emergence of signalling norms (and parochial cooperation) in majority groups closes the door for the minority groups' exploitation of the majority. When signals are costly, despite bearing the costs of sending signals, minority groups that adopt signalling and conditional trusting see an increase in average payoffs per agent that mainly stems from truster benefits (see Panels B and C in Figure S7). However, if signalling behaviour appears in the group, but is not followed by sufficient conditional trusting (e.g., red tiles when p = 0.6 and c &gt; 0 in Panel A of Figure S7), groups net losses because trustees bear the costs of signalling, but do not reap the benefits of parochial cooperation.Overall, groups that develop a (costly) signalling norm are better off than they were in the absence of signalling (see Panel A of Figure S7 for the average payoffs obtained by agents within each group compared to a non-signalling baseline scenario).

        <p>To understand the dynamics of norm emergence we show trait change dynamics in Figure 3, comparing a scenario with costless signals (Panel A) and a scenario with signals of intermediate cost (Panel B). For ease of interpretation, we only consider scenarios without any group assortment (φ = 0.5, α = p); Figures S9-S12 show detailed trait evolution plots with 95% confidence intervals. In Panel A in Figure 3, we show that, if signals are costless (c = 0), moderate minority groups (p ≥ 0.2) adopt the signalling trait the fastest, followed by moderate majority groups (0.6 ≤ p ≤ 0.7). Costless signalling fixates quickly, followed by conditional trusting; yet, the latter spreads with a smaller delay in minority than in majority groups. These results are in line with the results from our analytical model (Eq. 2): in groups with α &gt; α*, conditional trusting only pays off once a sufficiently high share of ingroup trustees signal their identity.To understand the dynamics of norm emergence we show trait change dynamics in Figure 3, comparing a scenario with costless signals (Panel A) and a scenario with signals of intermediate cost (Panel B).

        <p>Panel B shows that, under intermediate signal costs (c = 3), most minority groups (0.2 ≥ p ≤ 0.4) develop signalling and conditional trusting traits. Majority groups do not adopt conditional trusting as the share of signalling trustees never reaches the threshold needed for conditional trusting to be a viable strategy (Eq. 2).

        <p>In Figure 2 we showed that signalling norms do not fixate when mutation rates are low (mo = 0.0001). Inspecting the dynamics of these simulations suggests that signalling norms develop in some simulation runs, but not in others. Signalling takes off only once a sufficiently high share of trusters adopts signal recognition; but, depending on the dynamics of individual runs, this might not happen in every run (five out of twenty runs when p = 0.3, φ = 0.5, and c = 3, as shown in Figure S14). 9 The lower propensity of agents to randomly adopt signalling and conditional trusting makes it more difficult for social learning to boost the coevolution of the two traits in a manner that supports the wide adoption of the signalling norm. Inspecting different combinations of p and φ that result in the same α value, we observe similar rates, but different dynamics of signalling norm emergence. Smaller minority groups with a higher ingroup assortment (e.g., p = 0.3 and φ = 0.7) take longer to develop the signalling norm and show more variability across runs compared to larger groups with lower assortment, and same α (e.g., p = 0.4 and φ = 0.5, α = 0.4 for both, see Figures S17 andS18). 9 Figure S16 shows how, in a similar scenario with c = 5, a signalling norm emerges in only one out of 20 runs by time step 20 000.In Figure 2 we showed that signalling norms do not fixate when mutation rates are low (mo = 0.0001).

        <p>First, we relax the assumption that trustees can only send ingroup signals, allowing them to send outgroup signals in order to exploit the conditionally trusting outgroup. However, sending outgroup signals is not an equilibrium strategy for most groups, minority and majority alike. Only in the cases when a rather small minority group -whose benefits of parochial cooperation are low -faces a rather large majority group in a signalling equilibrium will there be an equilibrium with outgroup signalling. In these cases, minority trustees send outgroup signals (while minority trusters unconditionally distrust) and majority trusters conditionally trust (thereby reaping the benefits of parochially cooperating with the signalling ingroup and, at times, bearing the losses of being exploited by the outgroup).First, we relax the assumption that trustees can only send ingroup signals, allowing them to send outgroup signals in order to exploit the conditionally trusting outgroup.

        <p>Second, we relax the assumption that outgroup trusters do not recognize group signals, allowing trusters distrust only those trustees who display an outgroup signal. Signalling and signal recognition is still an equilibrium in several cases: (1) if both groups are in a signalling equilibrium; (2) if one group is in a signalling equilibrium, whereas trustees in the other do not signal and trusters discriminate against outgroup signals. In this setup, trustees are willing to bear lower costs of signalling compared to our main analysis. This is because signalling now includes a possibility of being distrusted by outgroup trusters -who could be abused without consequences in the main model. Our simulation results show that signalling norms still emerge in this setup, but in a somewhat narrower set of minority groups (Figures S20 andS21).Second, we relax the assumption that outgroup trusters do not recognize group signals, allowing trusters distrust only those trustees who display an outgroup signal.

        <p>Finally, we relax the assumption that trustees always perceive the trusters' group identity correctly upon being given trust. We define the threshold of error (i.e., noise) in the accuracy of trustees' perception of truster identity below which signalling and signal recognition remain equilibrium strategies. Our analytical results suggest this is the case even when trustees' perception of truster group identity is as good as a random guess. However, very high levels of noise can hamper signalling norm emergence as relative group size decreases or signalling cost increases (Figure S22). The level of noise groups of different sizes can tolerate in a signalling equilibrium depends on the payoff structure.Finally, we relax the assumption that trustees always perceive the trusters' group identity correctly upon being given trust.

        <p>Using a trust game allows us to model encounters where giving trust to an untrustworthy other exposes one to significant risks, while not giving trust can prevent one from successfully cooperating with the ingroup. Our formal analysis suggests that, while following a signalling norm can be an equilibrium for different groups, groups who face a lower share of potential ingroup cooperators are more likely to shift from a non-signalling to a signalling equilibrium. We use agent-based simulations to examine the emergence of traits related to signalling norms under different signalling costs, mutation rates, relative group shares, and extent of inter-group assortment.Using a trust game allows us to model encounters where giving trust to an untrustworthy other exposes one to significant risks, while not giving trust can prevent one from successfully cooperating with the ingroup.

        <p>Our agent-based simulations confirm that groups that constitute the minority in the populationand are, thus, less likely to encounter cooperative ingroup members -more easily develop (costly) signalling norms. Signalling norms facilitate cooperation with the ingroup while avoiding exploitation by the outgroup. However, when ingroup assortment is higher -for instance, because members of small groups live close to each other -signalling becomes less beneficial for promoting parochial cooperation [44].

        <p>Broadly in line with the literature on tag-based cooperation [45], we find that costless signals that cannot be recognized by the outgroup emerge to facilitate parochial cooperation rather easily across the groups. Costless signals improve majority group benefits as they allow the majority to avoid exploitation by the minority. This is, however, at the expense of minority groups who lose the opportunity to exploit otherwise trusting outgroup members. These results showcase how, in setups where groups have conflicting interests, group benefits sensitively depend on the actions of the outgroup (also see [46]). These findings remain robust even when relaxing several of our model assumptions. We assume that sending a signal of group identity requires cultural knowledge not easily accessible to the outgroup, which makes them hard to "fake" [21]. Yet, even if we allow groups to send outgroup signals, this strategy can benefit only rather small minority groups who are facing a majority outgroup who has already developed a signalling norm. Thereby, we specify the conditions under which outsiders could benefit from learning the (costly) "secret handshakes" of a group and exploit parochial cooperators by defecting instead of cooperating [47,48]. In our setup, sufficiently large groups can sustain parochial cooperation in spite of such exploitation.Broadly in line with the literature on tag-based cooperation [45], we find that costless signals that cannot be recognized by the outgroup emerge to facilitate parochial cooperation rather easily across the groups.

        <p>Extensions of our model could further explore other scenarios, such as those where groups can adopt new signals and establish cooperation before the signal is "hijacked" again, resulting in cycles of dominance of different reliable identity markers [18,19,21].Extensions of our model could further explore other scenarios, such as those where groups can adopt new signals and establish cooperation before the signal is "hijacked" again, resulting in cycles of dominance of different reliable identity markers [18,19,21].</p>
        <p>Our model considers signals that are so group specific that they remain undetectable to the outgroup [33,34]. If signals are unknown to the outgroup, group members can both reap the benefits of parochial cooperation with the ingroup and exploit the unsuspecting outgroup.Our model considers signals that are so group specific that they remain undetectable to the outgroup [33,34].

        <p>Relaxing this assumption, we find that, if signals are easily recognized and the outgroup can discriminate against them, smaller minority groups become less likely to develop signalling norms as they cannot bear the losses from discrimination. Small minority groups will likely benefit from developing signals that are not as easily recognized by the outgroup. In addition, our simulations show that the emergence of signalling norms in most groups remain undisturbed even as we introduce significant amounts of noise to the perception of group identities during encounters. It is the smallest minority groups that are the most sensitive to increases in uncertainty about the counterpart's identity.Relaxing this assumption, we find that, if signals are easily recognized and the outgroup can discriminate against them, smaller minority groups become less likely to develop signalling norms as they cannot bear the losses from discrimination.

        <p>Existing work has suggested that incidental individual behaviours can develop into social norms prescribing signals of some qualities in the population [4]. Our results show that this can indeed be the case in groups that constitute a minority in the population as long as these incidental behaviours are frequent enough. Further, majority groups in the population cannot move from the non-signalling equilibrium. This is because they fail to reach the high threshold as from which sending costly signals becomes beneficial. Developing a signalling norm in majority groups might, thus, require a stronger stochastic shock to introduce sufficiently wide signal recognition, for instance, via a centralized or persuasive intervention [8,49,50].Existing work has suggested that incidental individual behaviours can develop into social norms prescribing signals of some qualities in the population [4].

        <p>Research has suggested that selectively interacting with one's group allows parochial cooperation to emerge [44,[51][52][53][54]. We, however, allow agents to condition cooperation on the partner's signal (or absence thereof) in a randomly mixed population. This allows us to model how signals can emerge to support parochial cooperation even in adverse contexts where individuals have to face unknown others -as is often the case in large, complex societies where one cannot rely on knowledge from past interactions [40]. We further explore the interaction between relative group size and the likelihood of interacting with the ingroup. Our results highlight that isolated minority communities who infrequently encounter the outgroup benefit less from signals of group identity.Research has suggested that selectively interacting with one's group allows parochial cooperation to emerge [44,[51][52][53][54].

        <p>At the same time, minority groups situated at group boundaries who encounter the outgroup more frequently obtain more benefit from being able to tell friends and foes apart.

        <p>We analyse when a norm prescribing an individual signal of group identity can emerge to facilitate parochial cooperation. Combining our model with existing work that evaluates how groups coordinate on a specific signal among the multitude of potential candidates could help understand signalling norm emergence more generally [4,[55][56][57][58][59]. To gain a more realistic understanding of how large numbers of group members come to recognize a specific signal as a reliable marker of group identity, studies could allow agents to choose their partners based on displayed signals or consider the possibility that certain individuals can send signals at a lower cost, kick-starting their recognition in the population [32,55]. Further, our model assumes that coherent groups with conflicting interests exist before signalling norms emerge. This is the case when, for instance, geographical boundaries or kinship ties determine group formation and constrain resource sharing with other groups. Generalizing our insights even further, future work could consider modelling the coevolution of groups and signalling norms [60]. Finally, our model captures contexts where individuals successfully cooperate within groups, but face environmental restrictions that put their interests at odds with those of other groups [23,30,61]. Extending our model to situations where periods of intergroup conflict are interrupted by peaceful coexistence can help understand how, by supporting parochial cooperation, signalling norms that emerge in the times of conflict could hamper intergroup cooperation during peaceful times [23].We analyse when a norm prescribing an individual signal of group identity can emerge to facilitate parochial cooperation.

Further, our model assumes that coherent groups with conflicting interests exist before signalling norms emerge. This is the case when, for instance, geographical boundaries or kinship ties determine group formation and constrain resource sharing with other groups. Generalizing our insights even further, future work could consider modelling the coevolution of groups and signalling norms [60]. Finally, our model captures contexts where individuals successfully cooperate within groups, but face environmental restrictions that put their interests at odds with those of other groups [23,30,61]. Extending our model to situations where periods of intergroup conflict are interrupted by peaceful coexistence can help understand how, by supporting parochial cooperation, signalling norms that emerge in the times of conflict could hamper intergroup cooperation during peaceful times [23].</p>

        <p>In this game, nature (denoted N in Figure S1) first determines the type of the trustee that a truster encounters as either ingroup (with the probability α) or outgroup (with the probability 1 -α). 1 The truster first decides whether they want to trust the trustee. If they decide to trust the trustee, the trustee then decides whether to honour this trust. From each group's perspective, trustees will be trustworthy towards trusters of the own group (that are encountered with a probability of α) and untrustworthy towards the outgroup (encountered with a probability of 1 -α). The probability α is common knowledge, but the group identity of the trustee is not directly observable to the truster in any particular encounter. The payoffs of both sides are ordered so to capture: (1) the benefits of a trusting truster and a trustworthy trustee engaging in interactions (e.g., long term cooperation); (2) the incentive of the untrustworthy trustee to abuse the trust given by a trusting truster; (3) the reluctance of the truster to trust given the possibility that they will encounter an untrustworthy trustee.In this game, nature (denoted N in Figure S1) first determines the type of the trustee that a truster encounters as either ingroup (with the probability α) or outgroup (with the probability 1 -α). 1 The truster first decides whether they want to trust the trustee.

        <p>In Figure S1, the payoff RI captures the high benefits of cooperation with trustworthy ingroup trustees; RO captures the low benefits of cooperation with a trustworthy outgroup trustees; P captures the rewards of staying out of the interaction; T captures the temptation of not honouring trust; and S captures the low payoff obtained by a truster whose trust has not been honoured by the trustee.

We assume that 𝑅 𝐼 &gt; 𝑇 and 𝑅 𝑂 &lt; 𝑇, so that trustees always honour the trust of an ingroup truster and never honour the outgroup truster's trust. Thus, in this game, the truster would always want to trust an ingroup trustee and never trust the outgroup trustee. We assume that this game is played once with each player, or that players do not recognize their partners in future transactions. We also assume that trusters reveal their group identity upon giving trust to trustees. 1 Note that in our setup, α corresponds to the share of one's ingroup in the total population. Strictly speaking, if an individual is a member of the group i that makes up share αi of the total population, their probability of encountering their ingroup member is (αin -1)/(n -1), where n is the number of individuals in the total population. For simplicity, we assume that n is sufficiently large so that this probability can be approximated by αi. Given the probability of meeting a trustworthy ingroup trustee α, the truster would be willing to trust a trustee if their expected payoff of doing so is higher than the payoff of remaining outside of the interaction and not trusting at all:2In Figure S1, the payoff RI captures the high benefits of cooperation with trustworthy ingroup trustees; RO captures the low benefits of cooperation with a trustworthy outgroup trustees; P captures the rewards of staying out of the interaction; T captures the temptation of not honouring trust; and S captures the low payoff obtained by a truster whose trust has not been honoured by the trustee.

        <p>Following this, under the conditions where α is below this threshold (α ≤ α*), a truster's expected payoff is higher when trust is not given in the first stage of the trust game (a truster does not give trust to any trustee they encounter, i.e., they unconditionally distrust). On the contrary, if α is above this threshold (α &gt; α*), trusters trust any trustee they encounter in the first stage of the trust game (i.e., they unconditionally trust). If a trustee could reliably signal their type (here: group identity), trusters could recognize the signal and use it to identify trustworthy trustees and avoid the untrustworthy ones (trusting ingroup trustees who signal, and distrusting anyone else, i.e., conditionally trust). The introduction of signalling of one's type in the trust game can, thus, allow for the emergence of a more collectively beneficial equilibrium in which trustees signal their group identity and are given trust by ingroup trusters conditional on the trusters having observed this signal. In setups with signalling, signals are type-separating if only trustworthy trustees can afford to send them [1,2]. In our setup, we make a simplifying assumption that group members can signal their group identity accurately, but do not have an incentive, the necessary knowledge, or the possibility to imitate signals of the outgroup. This could be either because it is cheaper to send the signal of one's own group than to imitate the one of the outgroup (e.g., a difficult to fake accent), or because either the benefits of cooperating with the outgroup or the benefits of abusing the trust given by the outgroup are not sufficiently high to offset the costs of signalling the outgroup's identity. 3 In Section S2.1, we discuss the consequences of relaxing this assumption. Under these assumptions, if a truster trusts an ingroup trustee, they both obtain payoff RI and if they trust an outgroup trustee, the truster always obtains S and the trustee T. In Figure S2 we show the trust game with incomplete information and signalling including the simplifying assumptions listed above.Following this, under the conditions where α is below this threshold (α ≤ α*), a truster's expected payoff is higher when trust is not given in the first stage of the trust game (a truster does not give trust to any trustee they encounter, i.e., they unconditionally distrust).

Consequently, the expected payoffs trusters obtain from conditionally trusting -compared to unconditionally (dis)trusting will be dependent on the share of signalling trustees in their own group.

        <p>We first analyse the consequences of relaxing the assumption that trustees can only send ingroup signals (i.e., signals corresponding to their group identity). As in our original setup, trustees have to decide on their signalling strategy before encountering a particular truster. That is, trustees cannot condition their signalling behaviour on the truster's group identity, as it is only revealed once trust is given by the truster.

        <p>(2) send a signal of their true group identity (i.e., ingroup signal); (3) send a signal of the outgroup identity (i.e., outgroup signal, whereby they "pretend" to be an outgroup trustee when signalling, but act according to their actual group identity if given trust). We analyse the most adverse setting, where sending an outgroup signal is as costly as sending an ingroup one. In this setup, one could benefit from sending an outgroup signal if outgroup trustees are conditionally trusting.(2) send a signal of their true group identity (i.e., ingroup signal); (3) send a signal of the outgroup identity (i.e., outgroup signal, whereby they "pretend" to be an outgroup trustee when signalling, but act according to their actual group identity if given trust).

        <p>While signalling outgroup identity blocks one from being given trust by the ingroup, it allows them to exploit the conditionally trusting outgroup. Given this, we now have to discuss equilibria bearing both groups' strategies in mind.

        <p>Next, we show that there is a Nash Equilibrium where trustees in both groups send ingroup signals and trusters recognize these signals, despite the fact that there is an opportunity to send signals imitating the outgroup. Proof 4. Similar to our analyses in Proof 1, we can show that trusters in both groups will always conditionally trust as long as all trustees are sending group identity signals. We then need to compare the utility of sending an ingroup versus sending an outgroup signal for trustees in both groups.Next, we show that there is a Nash Equilibrium where trustees in both groups send ingroup signals and trusters recognize these signals, despite the fact that there is an opportunity to send signals imitating the outgroup.

This suggests, that, if there is a possibility to send the outgroup signal, groups with an α below the threshold in Eq. 18 would prefer to send outgroup, rather than ingroup signals. On the other hand, as the benefit of parochial cooperation RI increases, the groups that prefer sending ingroup signals can become smaller. We further show that there is one equilibrium in which one group's trustees can send outgroup signals and exploit the outgroup trusters if the condition in Eq. 18 is not satisfied for one of the groups.α ≥ 𝑇 -𝑃 𝑅 𝐼 -2𝑃 + 𝑇 (18) Compared to our baseline analyses, the condition on the value of α under which ingroup signalling is beneficial for a group is more constrained.

        <p>We now relax the assumption that trusters cannot purposefully discriminate against the signalling outgroup trustees. To do so, we introduce an additional strategy of conditional distrust, where trusters trust all trustees unless they have observed an outgroup signal.

And their expected probability of meeting an outgroup member is: (38) These probabilities are symmetrical for group j. When φ = 0.5, an agent's likelihood of encountering their ingroup is equal to their ingroup's share in the population; when φ = 1, agents will only meet their ingroup, as all agents from group i will be in the habitat Li and all agents from group j will be in the habitat Lj. Therefore, the higher the φ, holding the ingroup's share in the total population fixed, the more likely a group member is to encounter their ingroup. To obtain the likelihood of types of encounters in the population as a whole:The first portion of the right side of the equation denotes the probability of agent from group i being in habitat Li multiplied by the probability of them finding another agent from group i in that same habitat; the second part denotes the probability of agent from group i being in habitat Lj multiplied by the probability of finding another agent from group i in that same habitat. And their expected probability of meeting an outgroup member is: (38) These probabilities are symmetrical for group j. When φ = 0.5, an agent's likelihood of encountering their ingroup is equal to their ingroup's share in the population; when φ = 1, agents will only meet their ingroup, as all agents from group i will be in the habitat Li and all agents from group j will be in the habitat Lj.

        <p>Figure 2A in the main text shows expectations regarding the emergence of the signalling norm based on our analytical results. Our results in Figure 2B trace the emergence of the norm in groups that start in a non-signalling state, and show that not all groups manage to shift into a signalling equilibrium. In Figure S19 below, we show the outcomes of a simulation where both groups were initiated to be in a signalling norm equilibrium with all trustees signalling (β1 = β2 = 1) and all trusters conditionally trusting (γ1 = γ2 = 1). We run these simulations for 20 000 rounds, with mutation rates as per the Y axis. Figure S19 shows a clear match to our theoretical expectations -signalling and conditional trusting remain largely predominant in groups that were initially in a signalling equilibrium. The exceptions are the small minority groups for which higher signalling costs become unbearable (see the red tiles in Figure 2A in main text) and groups where α approaches 1. As α becomes this high, even small deviations from full signalling and conditional trusting (especially introduced in simulations with higher rates of random mutations) can shift the group into a non-signalling equilibrium (also recall Tables S1 andS4). Since α is sufficiently high in these groups (i.e., the ingroup is almost always encountered), even a small decrease in the share of conditionally trusting trusters deems trustees unwilling to bear the costs of signalling if they encounter their ingroup with full certainty. Combining the results from the simulations starting in a signalling (Figure S19) and nonsignalling equilibria (Figure 2B) allows us to draw conclusions on the sizes of the basins of attraction of these two equilibria. It is apparent that, in line with the expectations from our main analysis, the basin of attraction of the signalling equilibrium is larger for groups with α ≤ α* than for groups with α &gt; α* since even a very small share of signalling and conditional trusting traits in the group (introduced through random mutations) can shift the whole group towards the signalling equilibrium; yet, the opposite is not true for groups with α &gt; α*. As α increases towards Figure S21 further helps us understand which strategies are adopted by different groups. We see that, unlike in our main model, all groups that do not develop a signalling norm adopt a large share of conditional distrusting -even if they do not face a signalling outgroup (e.g., see Panel C for a group with p = 0.9 facing a non-signalling and mostly conditionally trusting outgroup with p = 0.1 at φ = 0.5). These results suggest that, as random mutations introduce outgroup signalling, groups that would otherwise remain unconditionally trusting become unconditionally distrusting in order to avoid infrequent, but present, abuse of their trust. As a result, groups become unconditionally distrusting against the outgroup -even if this outgroup is not signalling.Figure 2A in the main text shows expectations regarding the emergence of the signalling norm based on our analytical results.

        <p>Even small bouts of minority signalling -without the full establishing of the norms -can bring upon wide-spread discrimination by the outgroup. Finally, in Figure S25, we evaluate simulation outcomes given different mutation rates and numbers of agents. Once again, at higher mutation rates (when mo ∈ {0.001, 0.002}), we see that changes in the number of agents in the simulation lead to comparable outcomes in most scenarios. We do see that, in some boundary cases (e.g., p = 0.6), signalling norms emerge more readily in smaller populations (N = 250). At lower mutation rates (mo = 0.0001), there is a larger variability of outcomes.Even small bouts of minority signalling -without the full establishing of the norms -can bring upon wide-spread discrimination by the outgroup.

        <p>We build our agent-based model in 
            <rs type="software">NetLogo</rs> [3]. At the beginning of each round, each agent is randomly assigned into a role of a truster or a trustee. They are matched with another agent with a different role. The probability of encountering an ingroup member depends on the share of the ingroup in the population (pi). Additionally, we inspect the interaction between the group's share in the population and the likelihood that individuals interact within their own group (ingroup assortment φ) to study the interaction between relative group size and signalling norm emergence dynamics. The interaction is played out based on each agent's group identity and traits, with the outcomes depending on agents' group identities and their strategies (outcomes of different strategies encountering each other are as per Figure S2). At the end of each round, an agent's payoff from that round is added to the list of their payoffs from up to twenty previous rounds; this list is then weighted to discount older payoffs and summed into their fitness score (w) over these rounds. We apply the moving average calculation as per Macy and Skvoretz [4] to obtain averaged fitness scores:
        </p>
        <p>Where wit is the fitness score of agent i at time t and Ot' is the vector of agent's payoffs in time periods from t' = 1 to t. We use a weighting factor of 0.9 t-t' that assigns greater weight to more recent outcomes. For instance, the most recent payoff will be given a weight of 1, the second most recent one of 0.9, the third most recent one of 0.81, and so on.Where wit is the fitness score of agent i at time t and Ot' is the vector of agent's payoffs in time periods from t' = 1 to t.

        <p>Each agent is then given a chance to update their traits through a social learning process. Each agent picks a random other agent from the same group and decides whether to imitate both of that agent's traits. We operationalize our learning mechanism using the proportional imitation rule as per Chica and colleagues [5]: an agent i with a strategy s(i) will adopt the strategy s(j) of agent j with a probability that increases in the difference between their payoffs in the previous round and is normalized by the difference of the maximum and minimum possible payoffs between two arbitrary agents (η):Each agent is then given a chance to update their traits through a social learning process.

To account for the different signal cost criteria compared to the main model, we adjust the trust game payoffs as per Table S5 below. We choose these parameters as they maintain a similar value of α* as in the original setup (0.42 compared to 0.43), but also help satisfy the signalling cost criterium in Eq. 20. All the other parameters remain the same.

        <p>As expected given our analyses, Panel C in Figure S20 shows that the range of groups that develop signalling is smaller compared to our baseline model. Groups with p = 0.1 do not adopt signalling even at low costs (c ≤ 1), as their benefits of parochial cooperation do not offset the losses they incur upon encountering the conditionally distrusting outgroup. Further, we see lower emergence of signalling norms in minority groups even at moderate increases in assortment. If signals are costless, groups with p &gt; 0.4 might still adopt them, but rather than fully parochially cooperating, these majority groups tend to adopt a high share of conditional distrusting in response to minority group's attempts at signalling, which prevents the full emergence of signalling norms.As expected given our analyses, Panel C in Figure S20 shows that the range of groups that develop signalling is smaller compared to our baseline model.

        <p>Using Eq. 28, Eq. 32, and Eq. 34 we can calculate the critical values of ζ for which signalling equilibrium holds in groups with different α. Table S6 shows that, given the payoffs in our main simulations, signalling equilibrium as per Theorem 9 exists for groups with all α values we survey in while 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 0.5. Do note that there are payoff combinations where there could be ζ values that do not satisfy the conditions in Eq. 28, 32, and 34,. For instance, keeping all other payoffs in our setup constant, setting S = 15 would result in ζ* = 0.23.Using Eq. 28, Eq. 32, and Eq. 34 we can calculate the critical values of ζ for which signalling equilibrium holds in groups with different α.

        <p>In Figure S22 below, we show that the outcomes with regard to the emergence of signalling in our agent-based simulations are robust to increases in the rate of trustee misperception of trusters ingroup identity, just as we expected given our analytical results in Section S2. 3. We see that, in all cases where signalling emerges fully without when there is no noise, increasing the share of cases in which trustees perceive truster's group identity wrong (honouring outgroup trust and dishonouring ingroup trust) up to 40 percent has no bearing on the final shares of signalling norms. In some cases, where emergence is incomplete even without any noise (e.g., at higher φ values when p ∈ {0.1, 0.2} and c = 5, at lower φ values when p = 0.6 and c = 1, and at p ∈ {0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9} and c = 0), we see some variability in signalling norm emergence given different error rates. Finally, we do see that, for some majority groups, introducing high rates of noise in truster recognition can help sustain low to moderate rates of emergence of signalling under low signalling costs (e.g., p = 0.7 and c = 1).In Figure S22 below, we show that the outcomes with regard to the emergence of signalling in our agent-based simulations are robust to increases in the rate of trustee misperception of trusters ingroup identity, just as we expected given our analytical results in Section S2. 3.

        <p>We check how robust our agent-based simulation outcomes are to changes in the values of some main parameters. First, we vary the number of agents in the population so that N ∈ {250, 500, 1000}, and the rate of random mutations so that it includes an additional value mo ∈ {0.0001, 0.001, 0.002}. Due to the computationally demanding nature of this task, we run these simulations for 15 000 steps (instead of 20 000 in the main simulations) and initiate 10 independent simulation runs. In Figure S23 we show that changes to the number of agents in our population do not alter our main conclusions at higher mutation rates. It is only when it comes to parameter combinations where the emergence is not full (e.g., p = 0.3, φ = 0.5, mo = 0.001) that we see more variability between simulations with different numbers of agents. Figure S24 shows that our results are mostly robust to the increase in mutation rates. Once again, we see more variability in scenarios where the signalling norm evolution is not as straightforward in the main simulations either. Here, either higher or lower rates of mutation can lead to somewhat different outcomes. Overall, however, we can conclude that increasing the mutation rate does not lead to qualitatively different results; while our main conclusion about the necessity of sufficiently high mutation rates still holds.We check how robust our agent-based simulation outcomes are to changes in the values of some main parameters.
