        <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor. Early-stage CAD can progress if undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), deep 2 learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the most useful architectures for classification.</p>
        <p>A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation.</p>
        <p>A classification accuracy of 98.5% was achieved. Our proposed model has the potential to be a useful diagnostic tool in hospitals for the classification of abnormal ECG signals.</p>
        <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. In 2012, 17.5 million deaths attributable to CVD were reported worldwide, accounting for 31% of all deaths. Of these, approximately 7.4 million deaths were due to coronary artery disease (CAD) [1]. In 2013, it was reported that 1 in every 7 Americans died due to CAD [2]. CAD is primarily the result of atherosclerosis, in which fibrofatty plaques develop and thicken within the wall of the coronary arteries, leading to stenosis of the coronary lumen [3][4][5]. CAD that is undiagnosed and/or untreated may progress and lead to complications. Composed of lipids contained within a luminal surface fibrous cap, an advanced or "vulnerable" atherosclerotic plaque can rupture suddenly. The contents spill into the coronary lumen, precipitating acute thrombosis, luminal occlusion and interruption of myocardial blood flow, which results in acute myocardial infarction (MI). [8,9]. The resultant MI induces chronic adverse cardiac remodeling that potentially leads to the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). Hence, timely diagnosis of CAD and MI is imperative; otherwise left ventricular function may become impaired. The electrocardiographic (ECG) signal is typically altered in established MI. In contrast, ECG perturbations in early CAD may be subtle and are easily missed and/or misinterpreted [6]. Clinically, the ECG is the most commonly used diagnostic tool for CAD because it is non-invasive and inexpensive. As ECG signals possess small amplitudes and short durations, measured in millivolts and milliseconds respectively, interpretation of these signals may suffer from wide inter-and intra-observer variabilities [7]. Automated diagnostic systems utilizing machine learning techniques may overcome these limitations [36]. Traditional machine learning techniques involve manual extraction and selection of features, which are cumbersome. In contrast, deep learning systems automatically extract and select significant features, and are the preferred method used in extant disease diagnosis applications [37][38][39][40]. In this paper, the characterization of three cardiac abnormalities (CAD, MI, CHF) using deep learning algorithms is discussed. Figures 1234depict the typical ECG signals (the isolated ECGs may not show classical patterns) in normal, MI, CAD, and CHF subjects. Conventional machine learning techniques have been used for the detection of MI [43][44][51][52][53]54], CAD [55][56][57][58][61][62][63] and CHF [59]. These methods are laborious and require the extraction of best performing features manually to obtain the highest performance. Hence, the deep learning algorithms were used in this work.</p>
        <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which a large dataset is often used to train the network. Significant features are created through each successive concealed layer of neurons as the network learns the input data. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built upon several concealed layers, delivering a deep structure. The ANN is the most basic algorithm in deep learning, wherein synthetic neurons are the very essence of the neural network [10]. The neurons are connected with weights, in which the weighted sum is computed once data have been sent to the input layer. The bias from each neuron is subsequently added to the weighted sum of inputs.</p>
        <p>The activation function determines the activation of a neuron. Once a neuron is activated, it passes information to other neurons in the successive layers, until the penultimate layer. Once a neuron activated in the output layer tallies with the input digit, the weights and biases are continually adjusted to ensure that the network is well-trained [11].</p>
        <p>The Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is commonly used in image and data analyses, as well as for classification of disease. It comprises three main layers: input, hidden, and output layers. Some models contain more layers, including non-convolutional layers. The hidden layers, known as the convolutional layers, form the heart of the CNN model. Different sized kernels are used in the convolutional layer to deduce the input, after which various feature maps are concatenated for analysis. The features that are created are used for classification in the successive layers [12]. The deeper the layers, the better the kernels become at detecting or classifying data. CNN is trained using the backpropagation algorithm [13],</p>
        <p>with the weights continually adjusted to reduce errors for optimum training performance.</p>
        <p>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is another model commonly utilized for the classification of physiological signals [14]. LSTM is a gated architecture that comprises blocks of memory cells, through which signals flow. It encompasses three gates: input, forget, and output gates. These gates control input activations into memory cells, reset the cells' memory, and control output flow into the network [15]. Mapping from an input x is calculated to form an output y by computing the unit activations of the network. In the network, the symbols t, t-1, t+1 denote the present, previous, and successive block values, respectively, while h and y represent the cell state and output values, respectively. The model works by retaining crucial information of previous states and building upon them. LSTM models are expedient for automatic feature extraction, as shown in earlier studies [16].</p>
        <p>The autoencoder uses an unsupervised algorithm to train the network. The encoders are arranged together to form a deeper network. Three main steps are employed to train the model.</p>
        <p>First, a series of encoders are trained layer-by-layer using unsupervised data. Second, the last layer is trained with supervised data. Finally, the backpropagation algorithm is incorporated for refining the whole network [17]. In the first step, coding and decoding steps are applied.</p>
        <p>Unlabeled inputs are encoded and the inputs are reconstructed accurately. During the coding and decoding phases, identical weights are used to encode the feature and reconstruct the output. The loss function calculates the information lost during input construction. A reconstruction with minimal loss value is almost identical to the original input [18]. Ten-fold validation was used to evaluate the performance of the system, which achieved a high accuracy of 99.37%. Acharya et al. [62] fed the acquired signals to the developed 11-layered CNN model. The performance of the model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, yielding an accuracy of 93.18%.</p>

        <p>Batch sizes of 10 and 60 epochs were used to develop the 16-layer CNN-LSTM model. Adam optimization parameters [42] exhibited a learning rate of 0.001. To improve generalization, dropout was applied to layers 14 and 16, with a dropout rate of 0.5. Bias was not introduced at the convolution layers, and weighted loss was employed for countering the class imbalance. The parameter details of different layers used to build the model are shown in Table 3. After the signals were input to the network, max pooling was employed after the convolution layers in every instance, in order to extract the optimal features for classification. Ten-fold cross-validation [41] was then incorporated to evaluate the performance of the developed model, whereby 80% of the training data was employed for training and 20% for validation. Figure 5 presents the CNN-LSTM architecture, and its details are provided in Table 3. Each convolution layer was used to extract features from input signals to form feature maps for the subsequent layer. Max pooling layers were added each time after the convolution layers to sieve out the top features. The dropout layer was added to improve the generalization of features.</p>
        <p>High classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive values of 98.51%, 97.89%, 99.30%, 97.33%, respectively, were obtained with the proposed deep learning model. In an earlier study, Acharya et al. [43]</p>
        <p>The system established in this study is powerful as it has been validated using 10-fold.</p>
        <p>The entire data (large data) from PhysioNet was used.</p>
        <p>With the developed model, three cardiac abnormalities can be detected.</p>

        <p>Sizeable data is needed to train and test the model.</p>
        <p>Only a small data size of 7 was used to represent CAD patients.</p>
        <p>In future work, we intend to develop a deep learning model that is better able to detect early stages of CAD, so that incident MI and CHF events can be averted. This would allow room for earlier diagnosis and timely treatment.</p>
        <p>Cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of death globally. When CAD is not identified during diagnostic testing, the disease can later manifest as MI and CHF. Cost-effective ECGs can be used to screen for CAD, so that treatment can be initiated to avert MI and CHF events. precision rate of 98.5%. Ten-fold cross-validation provided confirmatory evidence as to the robustness of our proposed system. Hence it has the potential to be used as a diagnostic screening tool for CAD, which can lessen the workload of healthcare professionals. In the future, a deep learning model to detect early stages of CAD shall be developed.</p>
