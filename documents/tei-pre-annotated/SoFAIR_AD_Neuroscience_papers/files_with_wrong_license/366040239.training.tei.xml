        <p>Results. Out of 99 questionnaires obtained, 43 were related to children with ASD and 56 to control group. Children with ASD predominantly had changes in behavior, while children from control group mostly found no changes. The majority of parents of ASD children reported a negative impact in emotion management against those in control group reporting mostly positive or no impact. Caregivers reported higher mean scores of anxiety levels in themselves than in their children. ASD children and their parents had higher levels of anxiety than healthy ones. In the group with ASD, children that did not maintain routines had higher mean levels of anxiety than children that maintained routines.Results.

        <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction in addition to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Autism was first described by Leo Kanner in 1943, as a disorder in children who had problems relating to others and a high sensitivity to changes in their environment [1]. In 2013, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) created the umbrella diagnosis of ASD, consolidating four previously separate disorders: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified [2]. Although it appeared to be a rare disorder, the prevalence of ASD steadily increased [3][4][5][6].Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction in addition to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.

        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [7]. In Portugal, children were forced to stay at home with school lockdown on March 13. Some of them started to get homework from their teachers on a daily basis, while others took classes using videocall. Furthermore, the Portuguese Government began broadcasting classes through television [8]. Despite the attempt to maintain the access to education universal, some children in need of special education were harmed by its absence. In addition, with the adaptation of the health system, children with neurodevelopmental diseases such as ASD saw their therapies suspended.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 [7].

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led families to adapt their lives including social isolation and work from home. The consequences of this outbreak on mental health are still unknown [9,10]. Change in routine is often a significant challenge for children with ASD [11,12], and for that reason, families with children with ASD could be a vulnerable group to develop anxiety and mental abnormalities during quarantine.The COVID-19 pandemic has led families to adapt their lives including social isolation and work from home.

        <p>Our study aims to explore how children with ASD and their parents experienced the social isolation in their homes during school closedown in the COVID-19 outbreak. We hypothesised that, during quarantine, children with ASD would have more pronounced negative impact on different aspects of daily life. Furthermore, we expected that parents of children with ASD would report higher rates of stress and lower rates of adaptive capacity in regard to themselves and their children compared to parents of children without neurobehavioral disorders, during this time.Our study aims to explore how children with ASD and their parents experienced the social isolation in their homes during school closedown in the COVID-19 outbreak.

        <p>We conducted an observational, cross-sectional and analytical study. During April 2020, a total of 99 parents of school age children accepted to participate in this study. We contacted parents of children with the diagnosis of ASD, as well as parents of children without neurodevelopment disease (control group) by telephone or by e-mail (online form). We applied an anonymous questionnaire with a total of 24 groups of questions (Table I) in order to explore children's demographic and clinical characteristics, along with the impact of the social isolation at home during COVID-19 outbreak in different aspects of theirs' and their parent's daily life. The variables 'anxiety levels' and 'adaptation to quarantine' were rated in a 0-10 scale, with higher score indicated maximum anxiety/total adaptation to quarantine. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means and standard deviations. Comparison between ASD group with control group was performed using Student's t-test and Chi-square. All reported values of p are two-tailed, with a p value of 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Data analysis was performed using

        <p>Out of 99 questionnaires obtained, 43 were related to children diagnosed with ASD and 56 to children in the control group. Demographic characteristics of the sample are presented in table II. Mean age of the children participating in the study was 10.75 ± 3.13 years, and 68.7% were male. Most of the parents were university educated (62.9% for mothers and 61.1% for fathers), and children were in average in their 5th grade (5.22 ± 3.06 years). Regarding the house type, they mostly lived in villas with outdoor space (45.5%), with a mean household size of 3.71 ± 0.84 persons, and no statistically significant differences were found between both groups in these two variables (p = 0.420 for house type and p = 0.924 for household size).Out of 99 questionnaires obtained, 43 were related to children diagnosed with ASD and 56 to children in the control group.

        <p>School closedown and remote work were public health measures adopted in many countries in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus during COVID-19 outbreak. This measures have had a psychological impact in many families around the world [13]. Some studies identified stressors during quarantine such as duration of quarantine, fear of infection, frustration and boredom, inadequate information, finances and stigma [14]. During this period, some children saw their routines being completely changed and they were called to respect rules that are not always understandable for them (i.e., disinfect your hands, do not touch your eyes or nose, and cover your mouth) [15].School closedown and remote work were public health measures adopted in many countries in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus during COVID-19 outbreak.

        <p>There is considerable evidence that children with ASD are at intensified risk for anxiety, which can exacerbate ASD symptoms, and increase behavioral problems [16]. In our study, during school closedown period, children with ASD predominantly had changes in behavior, while most children in the control group maintained the previous behavior. Moreover, the causes for this behavior change reported by the parents were anxiety, irritability, obsession, hostility and impulsivity, all symptoms pre- viously described in the literature associated with this condition [16][17][18]. Emotion dysregulation is also a common issue experienced by individuals with ASD, and has been associated with maladaptive strategies [19]. Furthermore, anxiety and depression are among the most prevalent affective disorders in this children [2,18,20,21]. In fact, parents of our sample reported mostly a negative impact of quarantine in emotion management and higher mean levels of anxiety in ASD children against those in control group. On the other hand, the perception of the parents regarding the ability of adaptation to the quarantine was similar in both groups.There is considerable evidence that children with ASD are at intensified risk for anxiety, which can exacerbate ASD symptoms, and increase behavioral problems [16].

        <p>We also know that school demands and social engagement [17,22,23] are stressors for children with ASD and taking this into account we could imagine that being at home, during quarantine, away from these challenges could comfort these children. However, during this period these children had to face a huge stressor for them: change of routines. Indeed, in our study, children with ASD that did not maintain routines had higher mean levels of anxiety, and on the other hand children that maintained routines had higher mean levels of adaptability to the quarantine. Furthermore, in the control group the maintenance of routines does not seems to influence anxiety levels or the ability to adapt to quarantine. These results supports the hypothesis that a common feature of children on the autism spectrum is obsession with routine, inflexibility and rituals and this individuals could be a risk group for mental health complications from COVID-19 [12,24,25].We also know that school demands and social engagement [17,22,23] are stressors for children with ASD and taking this into account we could imagine that being at home, during quarantine, away from these challenges could comfort these children.

        <p>Despite this big change in family's lives, caregivers of our study were concerned with maintaining routines, distributing tasks and providing new experiences for their children, maybe in an attempt to reduce the negative impact of the quarantine and to avoid chaos at home. Moreover, caregivers reported higher mean scores of anxiety levels in themselves than in their children in both groups, and pointed out interesting major challenges such as child teaching, dealing with children behavior, maintaining routines, keeping children occupied and social isolation. Parents of children with ASD experienced higher mean levels of anxiety compared to the parents of the control group. This finding is not surprising since the stress in parents of children with this condition is well documented in the literature, and has been attributed to the child's challenging behaviours [26][27][28].Despite this big change in family's lives, caregivers of our study were concerned with maintaining routines, distributing tasks and providing new experiences for their children, maybe in an attempt to reduce the negative impact of the quarantine and to avoid chaos at home.

        <p>During COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations such as WHO and UNICEF provided guid-ance for support families to stress management [29][30][31][32][33][34]. Likewise, Narzisi [15] suggested tips for parents and caregivers of children with ASD to handle this condition during the COVID-19 'stay at home period' such as 'explain to your child what COVID-19 is' , 'structure daily life activities' , 'implement and share special interests with parents' , and 'maintain contact with the school' .During COVID-19 pandemic, several organizations such as WHO and UNICEF provided guid-ance for support families to stress management [29][30][31][32][33][34].

        <p>Although the parents of children with ASD in our study do not perceive a negative impact on their children's personal development, which can be explained by the fact that it is too early to assess these consequences, the suspension of special education and therapies can have a devastating consequence on the development of this individuals. For that reason, and since early intervention is essential in this condition, is mandatory to assess the needs of these children as soon as possible at this time. On the other hand, with the changes in primary care well-child visits, many children have failed the routine developmental screening and there may be a dramatic decrease in the referral of children in need of multidisciplinary assessment. It is therefore of extreme importance to systematically apply neurodevelopment screening tools to all children in the post-pandemic period.Although the parents of children with ASD in our study do not perceive a negative impact on their children's personal development, which can be explained by the fact that it is too early to assess these consequences, the suspension of special education and therapies can have a devastating consequence on the development of this individuals.

        <p>Nonetheless, our study has some limitations. All data were reported by parents rather than reported by children directly. Additionally, the autism subtype/severity level was not considered, and therefore children with high functioning autism were included in the same group as children with autism of other subtypes, with differences regarding cognitive and social functioning, which may have implications for the ability of adaptation strategies [35].Nonetheless, our study has some limitations.

        <p>In conclusion, physicians should be alert to warning signs shown not only by risk groups but also by all families with regard to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in mental health and we all must be prepared for the post-pandemic surveillance of mental disorders.In conclusion, physicians should be alert to warning signs shown not only by risk groups but also by all families with regard to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in mental health and we all must be prepared for the post-pandemic surveillance of mental disorders.</p>
