        <p>Peripheral nerve injury is common and frequently occurs in extremity trauma patients. The motor and sensory impairment caused by the injury will a ect patients' daily life and social work. Surgical therapeutic approaches don't assure functional recovery, which may lead to neuronal atrophy and hinder accelerated regeneration. Rehabilitation is a necessary stage for patients to recover better. A meaningful role in non-pharmacological intervention is played by rehabilitation, through individualized electrical stimulation therapy. Clinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation enhances axon growth during nerve repair and accelerates sensorimotor recovery. According to di erent e ects and parameters, electrical stimulation can be divided into neuromuscular, transcutaneous, and functional electrical stimulation. The therapeutic mechanism of electrical stimulation may be to reduce muscle atrophy and promote muscle reinnervation by increasing the expression of structural protective proteins and neurotrophic factors. Meanwhile, it can modulate sensory feedback and reduce neuralgia by inhibiting the descending pathway. However, there are not many summary clinical application parameters of electrical stimulation, and the longterm e ectiveness and safety also need to be further explored. This article aims to explore application methodologies for e ective electrical stimulation in the rehabilitation of peripheral nerve injury, with simultaneous consideration for fundamental principles of electrical stimulation and the latest technology. The highlight of this paper is to identify the most appropriate stimulation parameters (frequency, intensity, duration) to achieve e cacious electrical stimulation in the rehabilitation of peripheral nerve injury.Peripheral nerve injury is common and frequently occurs in extremity trauma patients.

Most studies used lowfrequency ES to promote nerve regeneration, but the method and frequency range of ES need to be standardized because highfrequency ES will aggravate nerve damage (6). The standard ES parameter of 20 Hz for one hour immediately after the repair is well known. However, its utility and efficacy for various nerves have never been defined.

        <p>Peripheral nerves refer to all nerves other than the brain and spinal cord, including ganglia, nerve trunks, nerve plexus and nerve ending. The center of the anatomical structure of the peripheral nerve is the nerve fiber. The endoneurium wraps around the nerve fibers to form the nerve bundle that is surrounded by loose connective tissue. The epineurium then wraps the nerve bundle to form a complete peripheral nerve (7). There are many pathogenic factors, such as infection, ischemia, trauma, metabolic disorders, poisoning, nutritional deficiency, and iatrogenic injury (such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.). Peripheral injury can lead to severe dysfunction, often affecting the ability of patients to perform activities of daily living. According to Seddon's classification in 1943, PNI was divided into three types neurapraxia, axonal disruption, and nerve rupture. According to the 1951 Sunderland classification, the PNI was divided into 5 types. Type I: focal demyelination; Type II: damage to axons but endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium intact; Type III damage to axons and endoneurium but perineurium and epineurium intact; Type IV: damage to axons, endoneurium, and perineurium but epineurium intact; Type V: complete loss of continuity (Figure 1). For non-severe injuries (Types I-III), Patients only required exercise training and physical therapy as treatment because adult nerves have some intrinsic regenerative capacity. For type IV and V injuries, it is necessary to suture the nerve transection by surgeries, including nerve manipulation and bridging (8).Peripheral nerves refer to all nerves other than the brain and spinal cord, including ganglia, nerve trunks, nerve plexus and nerve ending.

        <p>Currently, the surgical treatment of PNI includes microsurgical end-to-end repair, tension-free nerve epineurium suture, and autologous nerve grafting (9,10).

        <p>Although great advances have been made in surgical strategies to treat PNI, most patients did not undergo systematic rehabilitation after surgery, leaving them with lifelong sensorimotor disorders and chronic neuropathic pain. There is a need for a treatment to overcome the limitations of peripheral nerve recovery and improve patient physical function. ES is a promising method to accelerate peripheral nerve regeneration. After PNI, ES has been shown to promote early stages of nerve regeneration, including neuronal survival and axon bud formation (11). ES can not only treat PNI but also show the changes in the process of injury. The latest research has shown that the use of pulsed ES to act on the injured muscle and record the changes in muscle fibers, called the muscle velocity recovery cycle (MVRC), can provide a detailed understanding of the in vivo evidence of depolarized resting potential after PNI.

        <p>Since the 1980s multiple, animal studies have been conducted and have shown a positive effect of ES on peripheral nerve recovery. In a rat femoral nerve model, the use of 20 Hz continuous ES at the proximal end of the nerve reduced the axonal growth period from 10 to 3 weeks (13). ES that alters neuromuscular activity by electrical currents mainly includes neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and functional electrical stimulation (FES). NMES usually produces muscle contraction at a frequency of 20-50 Hz and is used to improve patient function. TENS is usually used to relieve pain at a low frequency of 2-10 Hz or ultra-high frequency. Low-frequency TENS generally targets sensory nerves and does not produce visible muscle contraction. FES is a functional task, in which the target muscle is initially stimulated to generate movement, and the next step is to achieve the upper limb grasping the object or the lower limb walking. The current ES instrument is mostly small portable devices, such as 300 PV Empi, Bioness R L300 Go, and Bioness R H200 Wireless (Figures 2345).Since the 1980s multiple, animal studies have been conducted and have shown a positive effect of ES on peripheral nerve recovery.

        <p>When ES induces muscle contraction, H-reflex and M-wave waves are recorded by electromyography. (H-reflex is an action potential triggered by the current to afferent axons of LA fibers, which recruits low-threshold motor units; When the current intensity gradually increases, the motor axon is activated to produce a motor response called M wave.) This method of muscle activation, when the strength of the current applied by electrodes placed on the muscle or nerve causes muscle contraction, is referred to as NMES. NMES is commonly used to restore skeletal muscle mass and function in patients of PNI and is also applied to activate the nervous system in healthy individuals (14).When ES induces muscle contraction, H-reflex and M-wave waves are recorded by electromyography.

        <p>Moreover, excessive ES induces muscle fatigue and weakens the effect of improving nerve recovery. Vanderthommen et al. (23) suggested that brief intermittent ES was the best choice and high-frequency currents caused premature muscle fatigue. To avoid muscle fatigue, some scholars have done comparative studies between muscle ES and nerve ES. The result suggested that electrical nerve stimulation might be more comfortable and less to cause muscle fatigue than electrical muscle stimulation (24).Moreover, excessive ES induces muscle fatigue and weakens the effect of improving nerve recovery.

        <p>However, not all clinical applications of NMES are effective. Hyer et al. (25) used NMES to treat the calf muscles of patients after achilles tendon surgery.

There was no significant difference between the ES group and the control group (26). Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the optimal parameters of ES.

        <p>Compared with delayed ES after surgery, immediate ES is more conducive to neuromuscular recovery. It was reported that after sciatic nerve transection in rats, direct ES of the proximal sciatic nerve, immediate motor cortex stimulation (MCS) (60 Hz, 3-10 V, 200 µs) for 15 min and treatment for 2 weeks. The results showed that MCS was more effective than direct nerve stimulation in nerve regeneration and muscle nerve reinnervation, especially in the immediate postoperative period (27).Compared with delayed ES after surgery, immediate ES is more conducive to neuromuscular recovery.

        <p>A similar effect was seen with 10 min of ES compared with 60 min. A study of sciatic nerve transection in mice was conducted and compared 10 min and 60 min ESs with pulsed current (28). The experimental results have shown that both settings facilitated motor neuron regeneration with increased axonal excitability, axonal myelin, and improved motor function. This finding has also been validated in tibial nerve transection repair, where as little as 10 min of ES could increase early axonal regeneration and produce similar benefits to 60 min stimulation (29).A similar effect was seen with 10 min of ES compared with 60 min.

        <p>In the implantable ES experiment in rats, the contact area between the coil of the electrode and the nerve also had different effects on nerve regeneration. Some studies have compared three different nerve contact modes, which were point contact, 1/4 contact, and full coil contact.

        <p>From animal studies, the mechanism of direct muscle ES on PNI may be high expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene (32, 33). In experiments, surface electrodes were fixed to the skin of rats with nerve damage. The results showed that MHC expression in muscle was increased after ES, which promoted muscle strength recovery compared with the control group. A clinical trial has also verified that ES may achieve its effect by increasing MHC gene expression (34).From animal studies, the mechanism of direct muscle ES on PNI may be high expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene (32, 33).

        <p>In addition, ES can also lead to an increase in light chain 3B-II (LC3-II) autophagy level. In one research, the sciatic nerve of rats was transected, and the proximal and distal parts of the nerve were repaired. The rats received ES (100 Hz, 200 µs, stimulation 5 s and intermittent 10 s, 30 min/day) for 2 weeks. The outcome measurements had the sciatic function index, the structure of muscle fiber, and the growth of nerve axons. The results have shown that the rehabilitation plus ES group was better than the control group. Among them, studies have observed that ES could increase LC3-II whose level represented the degree of autophagy. After adding an autophagy inhibitor, the effect of ES was attenuated. More powerful evidence was provided (35).In addition, ES can also lead to an increase in light chain 3B-II (LC3-II) autophagy level.

        <p>Moreover, ES can increase beneficial M2 macrophage, allowing faster nerve repair (36). In a clinical trial, ES combined with protein intake increased pro-inflammatory-like macrophages, which could activate the early step of muscle regeneration and accelerate collagen synthesis. ES might cause muscle damage, thereby accumulating inflammatory macrophages. Pro-inflammatory-like macrophages were decreased with aging, and the data from this study suggested that the increase of macrophages might be a positive adaptive response, and muscle loading alleviated muscle atrophy during the cessation of ES (36).Moreover, ES can increase beneficial M2 macrophage, allowing faster nerve repair (36).

        <p>Previous studies have suggested that the effect of nerve ES is achieved by the up-regulation expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (37-39), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (40), Tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB) (41, 42) and Increasing of adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (43). ES can cause Ca 2+ influx, and the increase of Ca 2+ in nerve cells induces the up-regulation of BDNF and TrkB expression (44). Overexpression of BDNF can inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, resulting in a sustained increase in cAMP levels (38,45). Cytoskeleton formation is accelerated by activation of cAMPresponse element binding protein (CREB), upregulation of RAGs such as T-α-1 tubulin and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression (46), and inhibition of Rho (47). In addition, trkBstimulated Ras activated CREB through P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK) pathway (18) and activation of kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway (48) to enhance the effect of ES on peripheral nerve regeneration (Figure 6).Previous studies have suggested that the effect of nerve ES is achieved by the up-regulation expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (37-39), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (40), Tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB) (41, 42) and Increasing of adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (43).

        <p>The repair of nerve injury was delayed for different time durations (2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks), brief depolarizing ES (20 Hz, 3 V, 20 min) was applied to rats that were bridged with a hollow nerve conduit after sciatic nerve transection. The results have shown that the diameter and number of regenerated axons, myelin sheath thickness, and the number of the motor and sensory neurons significantly increased in delayed nerve injury repair. The brief ES also increased the expression of BDNF, which accelerated axon regeneration by BDNF-mediated neurotrophin signaling (37).The repair of nerve injury was delayed for different time durations (2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks), brief depolarizing ES (20 Hz, 3 V, 20 min) was applied to rats that were bridged with a hollow nerve conduit after sciatic nerve transection.

( 50) used mice with sciatic nerve transection to show that both single and repeated ES increased the direct muscle responses. Mice that received a single ES showed a progressive increase in muscle contraction amplitude during recovery. Only in repeated treatment mice, cell bodies of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic contacts were sustained, including VGLUT 1. The maintenance of VGLUT1+ inputs onto motoneurons might be related to the expression of BDNF and its trkB receptor. Moreover, the H-reflex became twice its pre-injury level after repeated ES, which indicated that repeated ES could preserve muscle reflex by sustaining of VGLUT 1 (50).Formation of synapses and the sustaining of motor neuron's cell body including vesicle glutamate transporters 1 (VGLUT 1) (50, 51).

        <p>In addition to nerve cells, Schwann cells (SC) are also affected by ES. In the animal model of tibial nerve transection, 1-time brief ES during surgery was used to improve the axonal regeneration of the transplanted nerve. The results observed that ES could convert M1 macrophages, which cause inflammation, into M2 macrophages, which are beneficial for repair, thereby rapidly removing myelin debris and improving neurological function (29, 52). Some scholars believed that ES could redistribute blood flow to active muscles and meet muscle metabolic demands, which encouraged muscle contraction (53,54). In animal experiments, nerve ES can increase the structural changes of capillaries in rats with nerve injury, thereby increasing blood flow, providing sufficient oxygen, and accelerating peripheral nerve regeneration (53). Especially at the current intensity of 10 mA and above, the effect of ES on accelerating the recovery of PNI was more significant (54).In addition to nerve cells, Schwann cells (SC) are also affected by ES.

        <p>ES that uses a small current to activate sensory axons without triggering muscle contraction is called TENS. It is often used to treat pain, spasticity, and urinary incontinence (55). The commonly used frequency in clinical practice is 1-150 Hz (56). In rehabilitation, TENS are used to improve sensory feedback and adjust neural network pathways. Sensory feedback plays an important role in completing an action. When the motor nerve is damaged and unable to conduct, the sensory nerve will temporarily innervate the muscle to prevent muscle atrophy until the motor nerve recovers. A concept is termed chipmaker protection or chipmaker "babysitting" (57). TENS can improve sensory feedback which is important for the movement of the body. Pain is one of the sensory disorders that patients complain about most obviously and affect their daily life most, and it is also the most subjective sensory disorder (56). Therefore, there is more corresponding research in this area.ES that uses a small current to activate sensory axons without triggering muscle contraction is called TENS.

Outcomes were no differences in mechanical pain threshold (MPT), heat pain threshold (HPT), tactile threshold (TT), and peripheral nerve conduction (PNC). However, patients felt more comfortable with Unmodulated 5-kHz currents. In an RCT (60), both high-frequency (100 Hz, 60 us) and low-frequency (3 Hz, 400 us) TENS improved pain in young adults, but there was no effect on the pain perception threshold of 15 elderly people (67 years old), reflecting that the elderly are less sensitive to TENS than young people.Bergeron-Vézina et al.

        <p>The current intensity from the beginning to the end of the stimulation ranged from 44.2 mA to an average final intensity of 85.0 mA. Outcome measurements had maximal handgrip strength, mechanical threshold, maximal handgrip strength (MHS), mechanical detection threshold (MDT), and pressure pain threshold (PPT). The results have shown that 1. The 20 kHz stimulation showed the lower MHS during the stimulation at the 15 min and 20 min when compared to the sham-stimulation group 2. The 20 kHz stimulation resulted in a slight increase in MDT at 15 min when compared to the sham-stimulation group 3. No effects were shown for PPT. The conclusion was that HFAC caused a partial block of nerve activity, which might be a therapeutic approach to the hyperactivity of the nervous system. Chronic pain can also be alleviated by nerve conduction block, but the optimal parameters are unknown (62). A double-blind trial used invasive ES at 10 kHz for chronic pain in 58 spinal cord (SCS) and 11 peripheral nerve (PNS) patients. Both groups showed a reduction of pain and disability after 3-6 months of stimulation, but PNS relieved pain to a greater extent than SCS. In patients with PNS, the effect of pain relief after stimulation was maintained for 12 h. There was no change in pain 2 h after stimulation in PNS patients, but the pain was significantly reduced after 4 h.

Implantable TENS is an effective method for peripheral nerve pain caused by upper limb trauma. This technology in the armpit implantation of a nerve stimulator and four electrodes were placed on the affected sensory nerve branches (mainly brachial plexus, median nerve, and radial nerve). According to the characteristics of each patient set the stimulation parameters. Stimulation was an action for 24 h after nerve repair surgery.

Implantable TENS preserved the structure of neuroanatomy, which was an effective and feasible treatment method (64). Similarly, implanted TENS (12 Hz, 20 mA, 20-200 µs) was used to treat refractory pain caused by subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). The electrodes of a small ES wearable device were implanted into the end of the axillary nerve and the deltoid muscle, and the surface electrode was attached to the skin. Longitudinal analysis has shown a significant reduction in pain, which was most pronounced at 5, 8, and 16 weeks after treatment (65).

        <p>A previous study used rats with sciatic nerve crush to verify the effect of ES, low-frequency ES (LFES 5 Hz), and high-frequency ES (HFES 100 Hz) in the early stage (at that time after injury) and late stage (7 days after injury). The results of the experiment were evaluated by motor function recovery score, thermal hyperalgesia test, gait analysis, and somatosensory cortex evoked potential. The results showed that immediate HFES significantly improved motor function but increased the susceptibility to neuropathic pain. Compared with LFES, HFES can increase the growth of nerve myelin sheath in both early and late stages. Late stage of HFES increased nerve regeneration without aggravating neuropathic pain in nerve crush injury. Moreover, cell experiments were also performed, in which the dorsal root ganglion cells of rats received ES at 5 Hz and 100 Hz for 30 min at 50 mA.

        <p>In an animal experiment, 60 rats were divided into a sham operation control group (SHAM), a sciatic nerve denervation group (DN), and sciatic nerve denervation plus ES (DN-SM). Surface ES (2 Hz, 25 V, 1 mA, 300 ms, 10 min/day) was performed for 28 days with one electrode attached to the achilles tendon and the other to the popliteal fossa. Proteomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics, and skeletal muscle function analysis were used to observe the molecular expression changes induced by ES. The results showed that the DN-SM group was better than the DN group in terms of muscle mass, muscle fiber diameter, and contractile properties. At the molecular cellular level, the FoxO and p53 signaling pathways are important in structural protection by bioinformatics analysis. Anti-apoptosis proteins (KCNA7, KCNJ11) were down-regulated after denervation but up-regulated after ES. Muscle fiber typerelated proteins (TNNI1, TNNT1, ACTN2), myosin light chain kinase 2 and myomesin 2, fibrosis-associated proteins (POSTN, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, FN1, and LUM) were all increased after denervation but decreased by ES.

        <p>The mechanism of TENS to relieve pain and promote nerve regeneration may be that (1) TENS can stimulate low-threshold skin afferents to inhibit the positive transmission of nociceptive information in the central nervous system, thereby relieving pain (also known as, segmental modulation). In addition, TENS can stimulate the small-diameter afferent pathway to activate the descending pain inhibition pathway or block the afferent activity of peripheral neurons, forming a "busy line" effect (72). ( 2) It has been confirmed in the human body that ES can block nerve conduction and reduce H-reflex excitability, thereby improving the situation of abnormal increase in H-reflex caused by nerve overactivities, such as spasticity and pain (73). ( 3) Powerful evidence confirmed that from the aspects of hemodynamics, increasing blood flow to the ES can restore nourishment. In a study comparing TENS and NMES influence on the hemodynamics of the gastrocnemius muscle, the results showed that ES can increase muscle hemodynamics.

        <p>FES is the ES of muscles or nerves to provide functional improvement. Applications of FES include restoration of upper limb functions, such as stretching and grasping and lower limb functions, such as standing, balance, posture, and gait. There are three types of stimulation methods called fully implanted, percutaneous stimulation, and surface stimulation (75). For treatment, surface stimulation is preferable because it does not invade the body. Current surface electrodes use biocompatible gels that provide stability on the skin and uniform current distribution on the electrode surface. Conventional surface electrodes are suitable for innervating large muscles close to the skin (76).FES is the ES of muscles or nerves to provide functional improvement.

        <p>ES combined with exercise can more strongly promote peripheral axon regeneration and relieve pain after PNI (40,50). An RCT has shown that physical therapy exercise training combined with TENS was more effective in treating nerve pain in men (92). In a controlled study, low-level laser (continuous wave: 15 mW, 632.8 nm; Pulsed: 9.4 W, 904 nm) plus microamperes TENS had a significant effect compared with the control group in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome pain. And the improvement effect could be maintained for 1-3 years (93). The combination of low-frequency transcutaneous magnetic stimulation and ES in the treatment of PNI could counteract the slowing effect of TENS on the fast conduction fibers, and regulate the slow conduction of pain afferent fibers, resulting in better analgesic effect (94). Some scholars have combined cryotherapy with burst TENS to effectively improve the pain threshold of participants, and the effect of the combination was better, but the combination of cryotherapy and ordinary TENS had no improvement (95). Some researchers have also obtained negative results. Compared with the use of NMES or motor images alone, the combination of NMES and motor images did not achieve better results (96).ES combined with exercise can more strongly promote peripheral axon regeneration and relieve pain after PNI (40,50).

        <p>Similar studies in animal experiments have shown that ES could achieve better results when combined with exercise training, magnetic stimulation, and stem cell therapy. After sciatic nerve transection repair in adult rats, the rats were divided into 4 groups, the immediate ES after injury (ESA), delayed ES, ES+ exercise, and exercise groups. The results have shown that compared with the control group and the rats receiving delayed ES, ESA with or without exercise group improved muscle reinnervation and increased the number of regenerated myelin axons. ESA combined with exercise significantly improved muscle reinnervation at an early stage (97). In an animal experiment, electrical muscle stimulation prevented muscle mass loss. Combined with exercise, twitch characteristics, fatigue index, mechanical sensitivity, and mechanosensitivity could be further recovered (98). PNI would enhance the transmission of pain fibers and lead to chronic posttraumatic pain. Animal experiments have shown that magnetic stimulation and ES could promote the recovery of PNI and allow a tolerance of high-intensity output (99). The combined effect of ES and stem cell therapy could better promote nerve regeneration and improve functional recovery after sciatic nerve transection in rats. ES was able to up-regulate the expression of neurotrophic factors (BDNF, NTF-3) and increase the expression of neurotrophic factor receptor (Trk) in human neural progenitor cells (hNPC). Thus, it was capable of promoting angiogenesis, axon dendrite growth, myelin sheath thickening, and accelerate peripheral nerve regeneration and functional recovery (39). Most importantly, the changes in the central nervous system after PNI are not well understood, which is the basis for determining the appropriate method of ES and finding new methods. Although there are many positive results of ES, there are also some doubts about perceptions. For example, some studies have shown that ES could aggravate muscle fiber atrophy, reduce muscle excitability, and inhibit peripheral nerve regeneration (100).Similar studies in animal experiments have shown that ES could achieve better results when combined with exercise training, magnetic stimulation, and stem cell therapy.
