        <p>Inflammation contributes to many chronic conditions. It is often associated with circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cells. GLP-1 levels correlate with disease severity. They are often elevated and can serve as markers of inflammation. Previous studies have shown that oxytocin, hCG, ghrelin, alpha-MSH and ACTH have receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory properties that can rescue cells from damage and death. These peptides have been studied well in the past century. In contrast, GLP-1 and its anti-inflammatory properties have been recognized only recently. GLP-1 has been proven to be a useful adjuvant therapy in type-2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and hyperglycemia. It also lowers HbA1C and protects cells of the cardiovascular and nervous systems by reducing inflammation and apoptosis. In this review we have explored the link between GLP-1, inflammation, and sepsis.Inflammation contributes to many chronic conditions.

        <p>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30-31 amino acid long incretin that is produced when proglucagon undergoes posttranslational processing. This glucose-lowering agent is secreted by intestinal enteroendocrine L-cells in response to nutritional and inflammatory stimuli and by neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem. GLP-1 activates a seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, GLP-1R. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in pancreatic islet b-cells, pulmonary epithelial cells, atrial cardiac myocytes, vagal afferent neurons, neurons in a number of brain regions, as well as cells lining gastric pits and small intestinal mucosa. The GLP-1R can couple to the Gs or Gq proteins, leading to increases in intracellular cAMP and/or Ca2+ levels and activation of PKA, Epac-2, phospholipase C and ERK1/2 signal transduction pathways. Activation of GLP-1R by GLP-1 or other exogenous agonists, including exendin-4 and liraglutide, decreases inflammatory responses in several animal models like rat heart and whole animal model. The hypoglycemic activity of GLP-1 is associated with the stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon production and regulation of islet cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Under physiological conditions, GLP-1 is rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) after it is released (7).Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a 30-31 amino acid long incretin that is produced when proglucagon undergoes posttranslational processing.

        <p>In 1923, Charles Kimball and John Murlin, in an attempt to purify commercial insulin, precipitated a pancreatic fraction that had a hyperglycemic effect (8). Identifying it as a secreted factor, they named it 'Glucagon' or 'Glucose Agonist'. In 1959, Roger Unger et al., developed the first antibody that could be used in a radioimmunoassay to detect glucagon in tissue samples and blood (9,10). In 1966, Ellis Samols, Vincent Marks and others confirmed the presence of glucagon-like immunoreactivity in extra-pancreatic tissue, especially the intestine. Subsequently in 1967, Samols and Marks reported glucagon-like material in pancreatectomized humans, indicating its extra-pancreatic origin (11). In 1968, Roger Unger demonstrated that intraduodenal administration of glucose increased the levels of a circulating glucagon-like substances (9,10). In contrast to glucagon, the intestinal glucagon-like material stimulated the release of insulin. It was clear that glucagon and the g l u c a g o n -l i k e m a t e r i a l w e r e d i s t i n c t e n t i t i e s , a n d immunohistochemical studies revealed that intestinal cells that were positive for the glucagon-like material had a different morphology from glucagon secreting a-cells. The cells that made glucagon-like material were called L-cells. In 1970 the glucagon precursor, proglucagon, was identified. In the pancreas, proglucagon undergoes post-translational cleavage yielding two fragments. One was a mature glucagon and the other was called the proglucagon fragment. In 1980, the intestinal glucagon-like material, glicentin, was identified along with a smaller species named oxyntomodulin in 1982. Collectively, these studies suggested that proglucagon undergoes tissue-specific processing resulting in formation of glicentin and oxyntomodulin in the intestine, and glucagon plus the N-terminal fragment of glicentin in the pancreas. In the 1980s Joel Habener described a new glucagon-related peptide encoded in the anglerfish preproglucagon cDNA. Subsequently two glucagon-related peptides were identified in rat, bovine, hamster, and human proglucagon. These two peptides are now called glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) as shown in Figure 1 "The proglucagon precursor (12-16).In 1923, Charles Kimball and John Murlin, in an attempt to purify commercial insulin, precipitated a pancreatic fraction that had a hyperglycemic effect (8).

        <p>The GLP-1 receptor is a member of the secretin subfamily (B1) of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It consists of 463 amino acids (17). These amino acids are arranged in seven transmembrane (7TM) alpha-helices with an N-terminal domain that is located extracellularly and a C-terminal domain that is intracellular. The transmembrane helices are connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (17,18). Ligand binding to its receptor occurs in two stages. The first step involves the binding of the extracellular domain to the C-terminus of the ligand. This causes a conformational shift that leads to attachment of the N-terminus of the ligand to the 7TM domain (18)(19)(20). (Figure 2) for a more detailed figure, refer to reference 18.The GLP-1 receptor is a member of the secretin subfamily (B1) of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It consists of 463 amino acids (17).

        <p>GLP-1 receptor signaling occurs primarily through the Gas stimulatory G protein (21). Coupling of Gas and Gaq in beta cells of pancreas lead to an increase in cAMP by activation of adenylyl cyclase and phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway. cAMP activates PKA and Epac-2 signal transduction pathways (22). PKA and Epac-2 inhibit the K-channel, altering Kv currents leading to calcium influx as well as calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in calcium-induced release of insulin granules (23). PKA and Epac-2 also activate cyclin D and CREB, leading to beta-cell proliferation, differentiation, and a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum stress response (24). Exenatide decreases ER stress in response to synthetic stressors (25). In mouse models, exendin-4 increases beta cell proliferation by activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (26). Human beta cells exposed to GLP-1 show increased beta cell proliferation (24, 25) (Figure 3).GLP-1 receptor signaling occurs primarily through the Gas stimulatory G protein (21).

        <p>Activation of the GLP-1 pathways decreases the inflammatory response in multiple models. GLP-1 Analog liraglutide improves vascular function in polymicrobial sepsis by reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation (24,(27)(28)(29)(30)(31). Exendin in diabetic mice diminishes inflammatory responses by increasing the expression of regulatory T cells (32). Liraglutide has anti-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells by decreasing activation of NF-kB, inhibiting TNF-alpha, and increasing nitric oxide production (28). Like GLP-1 agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which block the degradation of GLP-1, also cause attenuation of the inflammatory responses. Sitagliptin decreases the LPS-inflammatory response by inhibiting the NF-kB pathway. This leads to decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and decreased expression of COX-2 in cardiomyocytes (33). (Original by authors of the manuscript): The seven transmembrane alpha-helices are bound to G-protein subunits (19). These consist of alpha subunit and beta-gamma subunit complexes bound to GDP. In the inactive state, the a-subunit is bound to GDP. Upon binding of GLP-1, GDP is replaced by GTP, which then activates the a-subunit. The a-subunit and GTP complex activate signaling cascades through adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C (20).The third intracellular loop is most important in receptor signaling. In a cardiac fibrosis model, the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide reduced vascular reactivity, cardiac hypertrophy, fibroblast accumulation, collagen deposition and MCP-1 production (40).Activation of the GLP-1 pathways decreases the inflammatory response in multiple models.

        <p>The prevalence of Parkinson's disease has been rising in recent years (79,80). It is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disease and affects between 1% -2% of people above age 60 and 4% of those above age 80 (81-87). Parkinson's disease occurs when dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta form Lewy bodies and gradually die (88)(89)(90). The Lewy body is an abnormal aggregate containing alpha-synuclein. Most Parkinson's disease treatments focus on managing symptoms by replacing dopamine and improving dopaminergic signaling, but these treatments fail to address the underlying cellular degeneration (64,91). Since dopamine breaks down to form reactive oxygen species, it may contribute to disease progression (92,93). Activation of microglia plays a crucial role in spontaneous Parkinson's Disease in humans (64,(94)(95)(96). MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine) induces Parkinson's disease in rodents. MPTP is a pro-drug for the neurotoxin MPP+ (1-methyl-4- phenylpyridinium). This agent destroys dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (81,(97)(98)(99)(100)(101)(102)(103)(104).Exendin-4, a GLP-1 R agonist, has inhibitory effects on microglial activation and greatly reduces the expression of TNF-a and IL-1b caused by MPTP (67,(105)(106)(107). Exendin-4 inhibits 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced dopaminergic cell death in neuronal culture. The intraventricular administration of GLP-1 protects mice from MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell loss (64, 86, 108, 109).The prevalence of Parkinson's disease has been rising in recent years (79,80). It is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disease and affects between 1% -2% of people above age 60 and 4% of those above age 80 (81-87). Parkinson's disease occurs when dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta form Lewy bodies and gradually die (88)(89)(90). The Lewy body is an abnormal aggregate containing alpha-synuclein.

        <p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia; it is responsible for 60-70% of cases (110,111). About 1 person in 9 (10.8%) in the US population age 65 and older has AD (112). People 65+ years of age in Europe had a pooled incidence rate of AD of 19.4 per 1000 person-years (113)(114)(115). The Alzheimer's disease population increased by 5% from age 65 to 73, 13.1% from age 75 to 84, and 32% from age 85 and older (112, 116).

        <p>In AD, IL-1 beta is significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and may contribute to cognitive dysfunction by promoting the synthesis of amyloid precursor protein (117,118). GLP-1 therapies may have preventive and restorative effects on Alzheimer's disease (42,119). Exogenous GLP-1 (7-36) amide administration inhibited IL-1 beta transcription and prevented beta-induced amnesia and cell death (36,59,113,114). Also, it restores learning and memory by stimulating LTP (long-term p o t e n t i a t i o n ) ( 6 0 , 1 2 0 -1 2 2 ) . I n a r o d e n t m o d e l , neuroinflammation was reduced due to suppression of TNF-alpha when GLP-1 exenatide (20 ug/kg/day) was given intraperitoneally. The peptide improved memory and prevented the loss of hippocampal neurons (111, 123). Treatment with liraglutide in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease reduced the inflammatory response in the cortex by decreasing the number of activated microglia (60, 65,107,124,125). Mice that express two human mutant genes linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease develop a chronic inflammatory response (126). In these animals, D-Ala2-GIP reduces the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain, decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress (127).Microglia and astroglia express GIP receptors (128,129). Activating them reduces central inflammatory responses. GIP receptor activation increases microglia expression of key growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), glial cellline derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase A (PKA) dependent manner (130) (Figure 6).In AD, IL-1 beta is significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and may contribute to cognitive dysfunction by promoting the synthesis of amyloid precursor protein (117,118).

        <p>Along with its anti-inflammatory role in other organs, GLP-1 agonists play a vital role in wound healing. During normal wound healing, fibroblasts secrete collagen and multiple cytokines to regulate the process. They also produce matrix metalloproteinases [MMP] and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases [TIMP] (172)]. Matrix metalloproteinases promote degradation of extracellular matrix proteins (173). At high levels in wounds, MMPs delay wound healing (174,175). This activity of MMPs is modulated by the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (176). Increased activity of TIMPs is associated with better wound healing (177).Along with its anti-inflammatory role in other organs, GLP-1 agonists play a vital role in wound healing.

        <p>Chronic skin wounds in patients with diabetes have high levels of MMP-9 and low levels of TIMPs with resultant high MMP-9/ TIMP ratios (178). Higher MMP-9/TIMP ratios can also be seen in the serum of these patients (178,179). C-reactive protein, another indicator of inflammation, is elevated in patients with foot ulcers (180). Use of exendin-4 in patients with chronic diabetic wounds normalizes CRP levels in serum and medium (181) (Figure 12). Low MMP-9/TIMP ratios are associated with earlier wound healing and better overall outcomes (183). Use of GLP-1, both in vitro and invivo, results in low levels of MMP-9 and low MMP-9/TIMP ratios Diet and obesity may lead to dysregulated arginine metabolism and increase the production of advanced glycation end products (AGE) with subsequent activation of their receptor (RAGE), contributing to inflammation and asthma.

        <p>Obesity is an inflammatory disorder with dysregulated innate immune responses that cause the number of natural killer cells in the circulation to decrease (187). Obesity, along with psoriasis, is associated with chronic systemic inflammation (188). There is also a well-documented positive correlation between obesity and psoriasis (189). Treating obesity with GLP-1 agonists results in improvement of glucose tolerance and an improvement in psoriasis. The studies completed to date have shown decreases in both psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) (179,180,(190)(191)(192). Histopathological examination of psoriasis skin lesions after 12 weeks of liraglutide showed reduced epidermal thickness as well as evidence for lesion resolution (190).

        <p>A sub-study of a randomized trial involving 54 with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients treated for 26 weeks with liraglutide or placebo examined whether liraglutide exerted anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of inflammatory gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Human monocytic cell line (THP-1) cells. When compared to baseline, the results showed that liraglutide dramatically lowered the production of TNF-A IL1B and raised CCL5 in PBMCs. The placebo group did not show these effects. THP-1 cells were used in an in vitro test to investigate the potential direct effects of GLP-1 receptor activation on inflammatory genes. The production of inflammatory genes by THP-1 cells was induced by LPS in the presence or absence of 2.5 nM recombinant GLP-1. GLP-1 did not influence any of the tested genes, suggesting that it has no direct effects on monocytes. GLP-1R is not expressed at the mRNA level in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients' PBMCs or THP-1 monocytes.

        <p>In postmenopausal PCOS rat models, the effects of liraglutide on the cardiometabolic profile, the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and the blood pressure (BP) were investigated. Four-week-old female mice were treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 17 months and a placebo. Liraglutide was administered to postmenopausal PCOS rats over the last three weeks; and this resulted in a greater decrease in body weight, fat mass, food consumption, and insulin resistance than in control rats. Liraglutide improved both dyslipidemia and leptin levels in postmenopausal PCOS rats. In the control group, Liraglutide, only decreased intrarenal RAS transiently while increasing heart rate and decreasing blood pressure. In PCOS rats, liraglutide increased heart rate but did not affect blood pressure. Enalapril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, eliminated the BP differences between PCOS and control rats. Liraglutide and enalapril co-administration further lowered blood pressure only in control rats. In summary, Liraglutide lowered a number of cardiometabolic risk factors in postmenopausal PCOS. Hyperandrogenemia, on the other hand, prevented Liraglutide from regulating blood pressure in postmenopausal PCOS.

Thus, it supports the usefulness of GLP-1 and its analogs in the management of type 1 diabetes (210).</p>
        <p>The role of GLP-1 in patients with type 2 diabetes is wellstudied and well-established. Surprisingly, GLP-1 has been slow to emerge in patients with T1DM. The use of GLP-1 agonists may be considered in T1DM patients who are overweight or obese and not at glycemic goals. GLP-1 decreases inflammation in pancreas which can help in preserving beta cells and ameliorate the progression to Type 1 diabetes. Further studies are required to fully understand the role of GLP-1 in T1DM management (210).The role of GLP-1 in patients with type 2 diabetes is wellstudied and well-established.

        <p>Sepsis is characterized by widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction. It continues to be a major cause of illness, disability, and death at all ages (211). Hormones in the body, such as oxytocin ghrelin, alpha MSH, ACTH and hCG, have a significant role in reducing the inflammatory response that occurs during sepsis (3)(4)(5)(6). GLP-1 plays a crucial role in regulating the cytokine storm by binding to receptors in a wide variety of tissues including the brain, kidneys, liver, and lungs. It reduces proinflammatory processes and boosts anti-inflammatory ones throughout the body. Even though GLP-1's use of sepsis has been encouraging animal models, there have been no human trials. Additional research on the use of GLP-1 in patients with sepsis may further elucidate its anti-inflammatory properties and spur human studies.Sepsis is characterized by widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction.

        <p>GLP-1 and its agonists have opened new avenues for treatment of inflammatory diseases to mitigate organ dysfunction, septicemia, and post-sepsis syndrome. Further clinical research is required. Besides peptide hormones like ghrelin, oxytocin and hCG, consideration should be given to incretin and other related peptides.GLP-1 and its agonists have opened new avenues for treatment of inflammatory diseases to mitigate organ dysfunction, septicemia, and post-sepsis syndrome.

        <p>DSS-induced colitis in GLP-1 R knockout mice showed dysregulation of intestinal gene expression, as well as abnormal representation of microbes in feces and increased sensitivity to intestinal injury. Also, Exendin-4 administration caused significantly increased expression of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines in gut injury. (Yusta et al., 2015) (49) LPS+/-Exendin-4 Exendin-4 Inhibited production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a and IL-1 a in LPSinduced inflammation in mouse model. I.c.v and i.p Centrally injected Exendin 9-39 inhibited the gastroprotective effects of GLP-1 agonists, suggesting that this effect is managed by central mechanisms.DSS-induced colitis in GLP-1 R knockout mice showed dysregulation of intestinal gene expression, as well as abnormal representation of microbes in feces and increased sensitivity to intestinal injury.
