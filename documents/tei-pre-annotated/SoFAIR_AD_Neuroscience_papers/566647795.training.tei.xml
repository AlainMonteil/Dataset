        <p>More than half of patients who recover from COVID-19 experience fatigue. We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale.More than half of patients who recover from COVID-19 experience fatigue.

        <p>Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST.

        <p>Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABA B -ergic dysfunction.

        <p>A large number of patients who recover from the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2), manifest a plethora of long-lasting symptoms. Among them, a high proportion of individuals (53.1%) experience fatigue [1]. Fatigue is defined as a debilitating, nontransient feeling of physical and mental tiredness or exhaustion characterized by lack of energy, muscle weakness, slowed reactions, drowsiness, and deficit in concentration [2][3][4].A large number of patients who recover from the acute phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2), manifest a plethora of long-lasting symptoms.

        <p>Prolonged fatigue after infections could be the consequence of biologic, behavioral, and environmental factors [5]. For decades, clinicians have referred to a controversial disorder historically defined as "postviral fatigue syndrome" [6]. The main symptoms associated with this condition relate to muscle fatigability, aches, and pain. Nevertheless, the presence of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, and emotional lability, is also frequent [7]. Similar mechanisms can be envisioned for COVID-19, in which neurological, immunological and respiratory dysfunctions may finally cause fatigue [8]. Literature data converge on the assumption that fatigue is a multifaceted phenomenon with contributions of both cognitive and neuromuscular aspects.Prolonged fatigue after infections could be the consequence of biologic, behavioral, and environmental factors [5].

        <p>Cognitive fatigue is defined as a decline in cognitive functioning, during sustained mental work [9]. The affected cognitive functions, overall named "cognitive control" [10], include vigilance, executive attention, working memory, judgment and long-term memory recall [9]. The feeling that people may experience during or after prolonged periods of cognitive and/or physical activity is called "mental fatigue". Mental fatigue increases the perception of effort and worsens the performance during subsequent endurance exercise, despite it is not related to the capacity of the CNS to recruit muscles [11]. An imbalance between GABAergic and dopaminergic transmission has been postulated in "fatigue syndromes" [12][13][14]. Alterations in these neural circuits may partially account for both cognitive and mental fatigue [15].Cognitive fatigue is defined as a decline in cognitive functioning, during sustained mental work [9].

        <p>Neuromuscular fatigue is an exercise-induced reduction in the ability of a muscle to generate force. Within certain limits, it is essential for protecting the body against damage due to excessive exercise. Neuromuscular fatigue is related with peripheral or central causes [16]. "Peripheral fatigue" depends on progressive failure of peripheral nervous system function, i.e., impaired impulse conduction along the nerve or at the neuromuscular junction, deterioration of muscle contractile properties [17,18]. "Central fatigue" is the progressive reduction in the ability of the CNS to maximally activate muscles and depends on spinal and supraspinal mechanisms. Supraspinal fatigue is, at least in part, characterized by reduced output from the motor cortex to the spinal motor neurons [19], which is due to reduced excitability of cortical motor neurons and to activation failure of structures upstream the primary motor cortex, e.g., premotor area and basal ganglia [20,21].Neuromuscular fatigue is an exercise-induced reduction in the ability of a muscle to generate force.

        <p>To date, no conclusive studies have characterized the presence of fatigue in patients with SARS-CoV-2-related neurological manifestations, who have recovered from COVID-19. Current literature lacks a neuropsychological characterization of this population and no neurophysiological studies have addressed whether fatigue is of central or peripheral origin. The present study aims to provide a comprehensive clinical, neurophysiological, and neuropsychological profile of fatigued patients suffering from neurological manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2, who recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19.To date, no conclusive studies have characterized the presence of fatigue in patients with SARS-CoV-2-related neurological manifestations, who have recovered from COVID-19.

        <p>All patients admitted to the ward of Neurorehabilitation met the World Health Organization criteria defining the state of recovery from COVID-19. Inclusion criteria were: a) almost total resolution of the neurological symptoms resulting from COVID-19, b) FRS score ≥ 6, arbitrarily, indicating an important level of fatigue c) absence of neurological disorders prior to COVID-19, d) absence of prior or current diagnosis of psychiatric, endocrine, metabolic or cardiopulmonary conditions related to fatigue, e) absence of dyspnoea or other longlasting sequelae of interstitial COVID-19 pneumonia, f) absence of anaemia, g) no treatment with corticosteroids, antihistaminic, antihypertensive, diuretic, or hypnotic drugs at the time of study. A common clinical feature characterizing our post-COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of the infection was the hyperinflammatory state, as demonstrated by both markedly elevated Creactive protein (CRP) and interleukine-6 (IL-6) serum levels. The study was conducted at the end of the rehabilitation period. Twelve age-and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls (4 females; age 64.3 ± 10.5 years, p = 0.541 vs. patients; all right-handers).All patients admitted to the ward of Neurorehabilitation met the World Health Organization criteria defining the state of recovery from COVID-19.

We a priori decided to evaluate the dominant right hand in all patients, also in the only ambidextrous but predominantly left-handed patient, who however preferred to perform the task with their right hand.We used a pinching task of 1 min duration, in which COVID-19 patients and HC were asked to squeeze a dynamometer (Jamar, Patterson Medical, UK) with their right thumb and index finger as strongly as possible.

        <p>At the end of the sustained pinching task, participants were asked to report their level of perceived exertion using the Borg Category Ratio (CR100) scale [35] This scale ranges from 0 to 100 (0 = "nothing at all"; 100 = "extremely strong"). The number 100 implies an extremely strong perceptual intensity, i.e. the strongest effort and exertion a person has ever experienced.At the end of the sustained pinching task, participants were asked to report their level of perceived exertion using the Borg Category Ratio (CR100) scale [35] This scale ranges from 0 to 100 (0 = "nothing at all"; 100 = "extremely strong").

        <p>Peripheral fatigue can be assessed comparing pre-to-post exercise changes in compound muscle action potentials (CMAP or M-wave) evoked by supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation in the relaxed muscle [36,37].

        <p>Here we stimulated the right ulnar nerve at the wrist using a bar electrode with an interelectrode distance of 3.5 cm. Stimuli of 0.2 ms duration were delivered with a constant current stimulator (DS7A; Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK), controlled by Signal 
            <rs type="version">6</rs> software. CMAPs, were recorded from relaxed first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) on the dominant side with self-adhesive surface electrodes attached in a belly-tendon montage. The site of stimulation that produced the highest observable mechanical twitch and CMAP amplitude was determined. Stimuli were delivered in increments of 5-10 mA until obtaining a maximum response. The stimulation intensity was then increased to 130% to ensure supramaximal stimulation.

        <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) allows recording the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP), a measure of cortico-spinal excitability [40]. After a fatiguing isometric exercise, MEPs evoked in the resting target muscle are depressed for about half an hour [41]. In contrast, immediately after the end of exercise, MEPs are, for 1-2 min, larger than before contraction, a phenomenon termed post-contraction facilitation [42]. The cortical silent period (SP), the electromyographic silence following MEPs evoked in the tonically contracted target muscle, is increased after a fatiguing isometric muscle effort likely with the physiological purpose to reduce corticomotor output and prevent excessive peripheral exhaustion [43][44][45][46][47].Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) allows recording the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP), a measure of cortico-spinal excitability [40].

        <p>Here we recorded MEP from right FDI while participants were at rest, with arms relaxed, elbows flexed at 90 degrees, forearm and supinated hand lying on an armrest. Focal TMS of the hand area of left M1 was performed with a high-power Magstim 200 (Magstim Co., Whitland, UK), which delivers monophasic pulses. We used a 7 cm figure-of-eight coil, held over the optimum scalp position to elicit motor responses in FDI, with the induced current flowing in a posterior-anterior direction [48]. Optimum coil position was defined as the site where TMS consistently resulted in the largest MEP [48]. Intensities were expressed as percentage of maximum stimulator output (% MSO). Surface electromyography signals were band-pass filtered (3-3000 Hz) and amplified with a Digitimer D440-4 amplifier (Digitimer Ltd., Welwyn Garden City, UK). Single sweeps were digitized (sampling rate 10 kHz) and recorded on computer for later analysis using a CED 1401 A/D converter and Signal

        <p>Resting motor threshold (RMT) was established, defined as the minimum stimulus intensity (in % MSO) that produced a liminal MEP (&gt;50 μV in 5 of 10 trials) at rest [48]. Five MEPs were recorded from relaxed FDI following single TMS pulses (5 s inter-stimulus interval) at 120% RMT intensity. Peak-to-peak amplitude was measured and averaged off-line for each participant. Some 30 s after evoking MEPs at rest, we investigated SP duration by evoking five MEPs at 140% RMT in right FDI during sustained isometric contraction (thumb and index finger extended and pressed against each other) of self-estimated 50% maximum voluntary contraction. SP was defined as the time elapsing from the end of the MEP until the recurrence of voluntary tonic electromyographic activity [48]. In five single sweeps, SP was measured off-line, and the obtained values were averaged for each subject.Resting motor threshold (RMT) was established, defined as the minimum stimulus intensity (in % MSO) that produced a liminal MEP (&gt;50 μV in 5 of 10 trials) at rest [48].

        <p>Our data demonstrate a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on both feeling of fatigue and exhaustion. We administered the multidimensional FSS for a gross, non-specific evaluation of the feeling of fatigue in daily life, while the CR100 was adopted for evaluating the perceived effort immediately following a physical engagement. Finally, the FRS allowed us to obtain a quantification of the patients' perceived fatigue at the moment of the clinical assessment. As a common denominator, the scores provided by these instruments express how people, subjectively, feel and perceive fatigue. In line with previous evidence [1,49], the results from these scales show that post-COVID-19 patients perceive physical exhaustion, and experience sense of tiredness and lack of energy affecting their daily living.Our data demonstrate a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on both feeling of fatigue and exhaustion.

In contrast, a direct correlation was found between apathy and depressive symptoms. All these symptoms could be observed in neurological disorders of different aetiologies, including neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions [54][55][56][57]. It is also noteworthy that a significant proportion of patients suffering from psychiatric and neurological disorders exhibit a chronic, low-grade inflammation [58][59][60][61].BDI scores were significantly higher in post-COVID-19 patients than in HC.

        <p>Based on neuropsychological data, post-COVID-19 patients presented with cognitive deficits, particularly in the executive domain, in comparison with HC. MoCA scores were on average borderline compared to the Italian normative data cut-off [26], but they were lower than in the control group, concurring with a reduction in global cognition following COVID-19 with respect to HC. Moreover, three post-COVID-19 patients developed such a severe cognitive impairment that they were unable to participate in the computerized tests. In line with previous data [67], the abnormally low FAB scores we found in more than half of our post-COVID-19 patients clearly demonstrate evidence of a dysexecutive syndrome. The neuropsychological pattern we found, which is characterized by both dysexecutive syndrome and dysregulation of certain emotional-motivational aspects, often anticipates the development of dementia in patients suffering from neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases [68,69].Based on neuropsychological data, post-COVID-19 patients presented with cognitive deficits, particularly in the executive domain, in comparison with HC.

        <p>The coexistence of executive impairments and abnormal fatigue in post-COVID-19 patients is further supported by the performance in computerized tasks, which were implemented to evaluate the executive components of attention and the impact of fatigue on cognitive control [10]. The inferior performance in these tasks suggests diminished executive attention and cognitive control in post-COVID-19 patients compared to HC. Certainly, while a reduced executive attention could be the expression of the dysexecutive syndrome, the deficits in cognitive control relate to cognitive fatigue. Indeed, cognitive control tends to decrease when a subject undergoes a cognitively demanding task for a long time: this condition leads to increased distractibility, reducing the subject's capabilities to monitor the performance [70][71][72]. The impairment in executive attention emerges from RTs in both SIT and NT, which were significantly longer in post COVID-19 patients than in HC. NT and SIT evaluate the ability to inhibit inappropriate or irrelevant responses, to monitor conflicts, and to evaluate stimuli or resource allocation [73]. RTs in VT did not differ significantly between patients and HC. However, a low accuracy of performance, i.e. the percentage of errors, in all computerized tasks, leads to conclude for a decrease of cognitive control, which probably does not only depend on the dysexecutive syndrome, but is also related to fatigue.The coexistence of executive impairments and abnormal fatigue in post-COVID-19 patients is further supported by the performance in computerized tasks, which were implemented to evaluate the executive components of attention and the impact of fatigue on cognitive control [10].

        <p>We explored neurophysiological correlates of physical fatigue by studying the effects of a fatiguing isometric maximal muscle contraction on excitability measures of peripheral nerve and motor cortex [16]. During a fatiguing task, the CNS processes the level of perceived exertion at the primary somatosensory cortex. Sensorimotor integration modulates the activation of M1 and its corticospinal output. These mechanisms regulate the work rate and the need for rest [16]. However, this model does not explain why fatigue can be present at rest. In patients with "abnormal" fatigue, the amplified sense of fatigue might be due to pathological changes in the motor system, disruption of feedback to the primary somatosensory cortex and/or changes in patients' motivation.We explored neurophysiological correlates of physical fatigue by studying the effects of a fatiguing isometric maximal muscle contraction on excitability measures of peripheral nerve and motor cortex [16].

        <p>Patients showed a post-exercise decline neither in CMAPs nor in MEPs amplitude. This may be due to smaller amplitudes at baseline, which may have made further depression, both of CMAPs and MEPs, less likely after sustained muscular effort. However, CMAPs did neither decline in patients nor in HC, which may indicate that we were not able to detect a significant peripheral failure after the fatiguing task with the chosen neurophysiological measure. Conversely, the lack of postexercise depression of MEPs in patients only could be attributed, as an alternative hypothesis, to altered corticomotor excitability changes after fatiguing muscle contraction. Conceptually, this data bonds well with the abnormal post-exhaustion reduction of SP duration in patients, while in HC SP was prolonged, in line with previous data [74][75][76][77][78][79].Patients showed a post-exercise decline neither in CMAPs nor in MEPs amplitude.

        <p>Unlike spinal inhibitory circuitry, the cortical part of the SP is dependent on the integrity of GABA B -ergic circuits [80]. SP duration did not differ significantly between patients and HC at baseline, before the fatiguing pinching task. This result indicates that "under normal circumstances" the tonic activity of GABA B -ergic neurons within M1 exhibits a normal function. The fatiguing motor task, however, unmasked a reduced inhibition of corticomotor neurons in post-COVID-19 patients.Unlike spinal inhibitory circuitry, the cortical part of the SP is dependent on the integrity of GABA B -ergic circuits [80].

        <p>This phenomenon could be interpreted as a compensatory attempt of the central motor circuits to counteract a reduced peripheral capacity to generate force, and could thus be related to the already low pre-exercise mean MEP amplitudes in the patient group.This phenomenon could be interpreted as a compensatory attempt of the central motor circuits to counteract a reduced peripheral capacity to generate force, and could thus be related to the already low pre-exercise mean MEP amplitudes in the patient group.</p>
        <p>More intriguingly, the shortened cortical SP and the lack of MEP decline after the fatiguing exercise express an altered central functioning of sensory-motor circuits in controlling the muscle workload. The negative correlation of POST/PRE percentage change of SP duration with FSS in patients concurs with this interpretation.

        <p>In our sample of patients, the reduced activity of intracortical GABAergic circuits, reflected in post-exercise shortening of SP, was previously demonstrated by means of paired-pulse TMS techniques (data submitted). Patients presented, as compared to HC, markedly reduced short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and disruption of long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) assessed in the FDI at rest. SICI is thought to represent GABA A -receptor-mediated fast inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) in corticospinal neurons [81] and LICI is considered to be dependent on slow IPSPs mediated through GABA Breceptors [81]. Moreover, short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) was slightly diminished in these patients. SAI evaluates motor cortex inhibition induced by sensory afferents (through inhibitory connections from the primary somatosensory cortex to M1). SAI is modulated by excitatory cholinergic thalamocortical projections to the inhibitory GABAergic network in M1 and is reduced by muscarinic and GABA A agonist administration [81]. SAI was decreased during repetitive nonfatiguing movements inducing MEP depression [82] and was significantly activated during cognitive tasks [83]. Taken together, these findings point out to a general reduction of cortical GABAergic and -to a lesser extent -cholinergic activity in COVID-19 patients. This could underlie both the reduced cognition and the abnormal fatigue perception and could represent one of the possible mechanisms of COVID-19related neurotoxicity.In our sample of patients, the reduced activity of intracortical GABAergic circuits, reflected in post-exercise shortening of SP, was previously demonstrated by means of paired-pulse TMS techniques (data submitted).

        <p>Previous studies from animal models suggest that IL-6 hyperinflammatory-induced state may decrease the density of functional GABA receptors and shifts the balance between synaptic inhibition and excitation [84]. This imbalance could be responsible for alterations of neurophysiological responses [85] and for the misprocessing of information that largely regulate emotionally salient information and cognitive functions [86,87]. Neuroinflammation may induce central GABAergic impairment, representing a common denominator for neuromotor and cognitive fatigue, executive deficits, and apathy in post-COVID-19 patients (see Fig. 2).Previous studies from animal models suggest that IL-6 hyperinflammatory-induced state may decrease the density of functional GABA receptors and shifts the balance between synaptic inhibition and excitation [84].

        <p>This study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, we did not follow-up our patients during a prolonged period and are unable to predict, whether or not the described disturbances tend to disappear over time or to become chronic. Further, we did not explore fatigue either in a sample of post COVID-19 patients who did not sustain neurological (especially neuromuscular) complications or in a control group of patients with similar neurological affections unrelated to COVID-19. This would have made our findings on fatigue and cognitive dysfunction related directly to COVID-19 after-effects. Further studies will broaden the initial knowledge resulting from the present study.This study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged.
