        <p>Arrhythmias are an important group of cardiovascular disorder. An arrhythmia may occur on its own or in conjunction with other cardiovascular diseases [1]. Because of the high mortality rates in heart disease, early diagnosis and definitive differentiation of arrhythmias are important to patient treatment [2]. The most commonly used solution for arrhythmia detection is with the recording of the electrocardiogram (ECG), which displays the electrical activity of the heart over time from electrodes placed on the skin. The ECG leads, which capture the electrical potential of the heart from different angles and positions, can be used to indicate disease state via abnormalities in waveforms or rhythms [3]. The ECG is a record of the electrical characteristics of the heartbeat and has become one of the most important tools in the diagnosis of heart disease. It is crucial to diagnose a broad spectrum of abnormalities, from arrhythmia to acute coronary syndrome [4]. It contains much information not only about the structure of the heart, but also concerning the function of the electrical conduction system [5]. Different types of arrhythmias correspond to different patterns that can be represented by different ECG waveforms [6]. These patterns contain information about heart function and condition. Therefore, monitoring and recognition of ECG signals is an important issue in biomedicine [7].Arrhythmias are an important group of cardiovascular disorder.

        <p>Arrhythmia can be represented by a slow, rapid, or irregular heartbeat, and can be grouped as life-threatening versus non-life-threatening. According to the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation (AAMI), non-life-threatening arrhythmias can be divided into five main classes: non-ectopic (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V), fusion (F), and unknown (Q) [8]. Automatic arrhythmia detection based on the ECG provides great convenience as it does not require physicians to manually analyze the signals, and also helps people monitor heart conditions using wearable devices. Automated accurate arrhythmia detection requires machine assistance in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases [3].Arrhythmia can be represented by a slow, rapid, or irregular heartbeat, and can be grouped as life-threatening versus non-life-threatening.

        <p>Advances in machine learning have enabled the efficient development of computer-based diagnostic (CAD) systems and their application to many areas. The development of intelligent systems in the field of health, the processing of large amounts of raw data, and obtaining meaningful results from these data are of great interest [7]. Computer-aided interpretation has become increasingly essential in the field of healthcare since it recognized more than 50 years ago [4]. With the emergence of these systems, the workload of cardiologists has diminished, and the computational effectiveness and accuracy of disease detection have increased. In order to minimize visual errors and to compensate for manual interpretation, researchers began developing CAD systems to assist in the diagnosis using the ECG [5]. An effective CAD system requires a powerful pattern classifier, as well as a salient feature extractor that can extract significant information from the hidden layers of raw data [9]. Conventional methods require the use of handcrafted features for signal preprocessing, waveform detection, feature extraction, and classification. The encoded features are generally designed and selected by trial-and-error or experience. Therefore, these systems require more specific expertise in various domains and hence obtaining useful features is a time-consuming process. Deep learning techniques have been developed to overcome these difficulties and to provide improved detection rate without the use of fixed coded features [10].Advances in machine learning have enabled the efficient development of computer-based diagnostic (CAD) systems and their application to many areas.

        <p>Traditional neural network methods [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] and kernel-based classifiers [18][19][20] were among the most commonly used methods for arrhythmia data classification. These methods generally use inputs obtained by feature extraction instead of raw input signals. Since the desired high performance of raw input data could not be achieved, prior research focused on feature extraction methods rather than network structure. Time, frequency, statistical and non-linear properties are obtained by such approaches as the wavelet transform, Fourier transform, and higher order spectra (HOS) [21][22][23][24][67][68][69][70]. Due to the high dimensionality of feature vectors resulting from transformation methods, the size of these feature vectors is reduced with statistical approaches or techniques such as PCA. Deep learning techniques, which have recently become popular in machine learning, provide an effective means for knowledge gathering without need of feature engineering [25]. Deep learning structures using sufficient ECG input and dataset training have the potential to learn all previously important manual features, as well as previously unknown features [4]. In the field of machine learning, efficient use of multi-layer networks has been achieved due to both the introduction of effective approaches to solve optimization problems, as well as hardware advances such as implementation of graphical processing units. Innovative approaches for error propagation and developing techniques such as batch normalization, residual connections, and depthwise separable convolution, have facilitated the training of networks with many layers [26]. This area, a new sub-branch of machine learning called deep learning, has rapidly proliferated, leading to successful applications to process the ECG [27].Traditional neural network methods [11][12][13][14][15][16][17] and kernel-based classifiers [18][19][20] were among the most commonly used methods for arrhythmia data classification.

        <p>We have used 100,022 ECG beats from PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia public database [28] for the evaluation of deep learning models. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database includes N, S, V, F and Q main classes with each class having many sub-classes. We have used few groups in these classes for this work. These groups are chosen as they are widely used in the literature. The beats in our used dataset consist of five classes: normal beats (N), atrial premature beats (APB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). ECG data from modified limb lead II signals were organized into segments with 260 samples. Segments (one single beat) of continuous beats of 48 half-hour records of 47 patients were used for this work. The signals in each segment consist of 99 samples before the R peak, and 160 samples after the pulses. Beats tags were annotated by multiple cardiologists. Table 1 exhibits the classes, the number of pulses, and waveform examples of these classes in the arrhythmia data. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics card. To ensure consistency in all experimental studies, the data was divided into 80% training, 10% validation and 10% testing, and the same datasets were used in all proposed models. In order to take into account the imbalanced data distributions in the classes during the training of the models, a class weight was assigned to each class using the

        <p>Deep neural networks (DNN) are classical neural networks (NN) that are hierarchically bound and that contain many hidden layers [30]. In the arrhythmia classification problem, classical NN approaches and SVM classifiers have been replaced by DNN based classification models. DNN networks [31] input by raw ECG signals do not require preliminary feature extraction. The use of some temporal features in combination with raw signals has been shown to improve the performance of deep networks [32,33]. However, it should not be ignored that there is an additional cost in the stages of obtaining temporal features as RR interval. The denoising autoencoder (DAE) and stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) [33,34,35,36] approaches are frequently used to feed DNN classifiers with more suitable features, in contrast to the capability of shallow classifiers. The representations obtained from hidden layers of autoencoders are input to the Softmax layer, and classification operations are performed. Some studies have used the active learning structure to identify the most valuable beats for the DNN fine-tuning process [33,34,35]. In order to avoid overfitting during learning, effective solutions have been presented that fuse existing and previous Softmax outputs [33]. In addition, there are studies suggesting the use of one-dimensional ECG signals in model inputs by converting them into time-frequency images [36]. In studies using DNN, the effects of layer increments on classification have been an important parameter to address.Deep neural networks (DNN) are classical neural networks (NN) that are hierarchically bound and that contain many hidden layers [30].

        <p>In our investigation, described herein, we studied a simple model with single hidden layer versus deeper models, to observe the behavior of end-to-end DNN structures, and the number of parameters useful for networks in arrhythmia classification. The inputs of these models consisted of raw ECG signals, and their output was composed of five ECG classes. Fig. 1 shows graphs of the performance of a classical NN with a single hidden layer of 128 units in the training phase, along with several parameters (activation function, optimizer, and loss function). In Fig. 2, the graphs of training performances on the ECG data of the models with 2, 3, and 5 hidden layers are given, respectively, to observe the effect of layer increase on classification. These models are termed DNN-1, DNN-2 and DNN-3, respectively. The hidden layer units in these models are 128, and the activation functions are selected as ReLU and Adam optimizer. The increase in the number of layers using the existing arrhythmia dataset had a positive effect on the training stage. On the other hand, with the increase in the depth of the layer, the performance of the model was improved. We have provided various performance criteria to evaluate the trained models on unseen test data. The performance values are given in Table 2. The best accuracy performance of 99.11% was achieved with the DNN-3 model with five hidden layers. The sigmoid activation function used in the NN-1 model and the SGD optimizer led to a prolonged training period with very small changes in gradient. According to these results, besides the increase in the number of layers, the ReLU activation function and Adam optimizer have a significant effect on the performance of DNN networks.In our investigation, described herein, we studied a simple model with single hidden layer versus deeper models, to observe the behavior of end-to-end DNN structures, and the number of parameters useful for networks in arrhythmia classification.

        <p>The process of learning differential representations to map input data to target outputs is the basic step of machine learning. Traditional machine learning methods use various hand-engineered features to obtain representations of input data. In the case of deep learning, there is an automatic learning process from the low-level representations obtained from multiple layers, to the higher abstract representations in the training stage (see Fig. 3) [25]. Convolutional neural networks learn useful representations of input data in an end-to-end structure using the convolution operator.The process of learning differential representations to map input data to target outputs is the basic step of machine learning.

        <p>AlexNet's success in the ImageNet [37] competition in 2012 has made CNN applications popular, and their use in the medical field has become widespread. As the feature extraction process, which plays a critical role in ECG signal classification, is automated with convolutional neural networks, the use of CNN has become widespread in this field. These networks are used to classify patient-specific beats [6,38] and long duration ECG signals containing multiple rhythm classes [39,40,66], to detect different interval ECG segments [41], atrial fibrillation [41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48], and different types of ECG beats [8,49].AlexNet's success in the ImageNet [37] competition in 2012 has made CNN applications popular, and their use in the medical field has become widespread.

        <p>Models in CNN-based arrhythmia classification studies are prepared at depths reaching 9-layers [8], 11-layers [41], 16-layers [40] and 34-layers [39,42]. In these models, there are many hierarchically connected layers where the feature maps obtained with convolutional layers are subsampled with pooling layers and fully connected layers in the last stage of the model. In addition to these layers, regularized layers such as batch normalization and dropout are also employed [6,39,40,45]. These make the model more resistant to overfitting, so that the learning process is more effective. As layer size increases, optimization of the network becomes more difficult.Models in CNN-based arrhythmia classification studies are prepared at depths reaching 9-layers [8], 11-layers [41], 16-layers [40] and 34-layers [39,42].

        <p>Rajpurkar et al. [39] have employed residual network-like shortcut connections in 34-tier models to solve this problem in arrhythmia classification. Another difficulty in designing the networks is to determine the filter length and number of convolution layers. Filter length is usually selected in small sizes, such as 3 × 1 or 5 × 1. The main reasons for this are reduction of calculation cost and ability to distinguish signals with small differences between them [6]. Yet, it is seen that these filter lengths are chosen to be larger in networks designed for long duration signals. For example, Yildirim et al. [40] used a 50 × 1 size filter in the first convolution layer for 10 sec ECG signals,Rajpurkar et al.

        <p>Herein, in order to evaluate the performance of the operation of CNN networks on ECG input signals according to the number of layers, the models in Fig. 4 with different size layers are designed and developed. While designing these models, only CNN base layers such as convolution, sub-sampling and dense layers were used. The convolution layer numbers of the models were increased and the layer parameters were designed to be the same. Our aim is to observe the impact of deepening CNN networks on existing data. The filter numbers are set to increase continuously to 32, 64, 128, and 256. Kernel sizes 5, 3, 5, and 3 were chosen, respectively. The CNN networks designed for the experimental study were trained on the arrhythmia data separately, and changes in accuracy and loss values for the training and validation sets are given in Fig. 5.Herein, in order to evaluate the performance of the operation of CNN networks on ECG input signals according to the number of layers, the models in Fig. 4 with different size layers are designed and developed.

        <p>Accuracy Graphs For the data analyzed, there were no significant differences between CNN performances during the training phase. However, it was found that the best performance was obtained for the CNN-4 model containing four convolution layers. Accordingly, it can be said that more distinctive representations of the input data are obtained due to the increase in number of layers. The values of some performance criteria on the test data of the models are given in Table 3. The F1-score and sensitivity values for APB class were at low levels as compared to other classes. The main reason for this may be that this class has the least amount of data. Although the widespread use of CNN networks is based upon end-to-end classification, the feature maps obtained from the intermediate layers of these models are rich in information.Accuracy Graphs For the data analyzed, there were no significant differences between CNN performances during the training phase.

        <p>With this in mind, recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been created by adding an internal memory to feedforward neural networks [55,56]. Although RNNs are successful in shortterm memory operations, they have failed to learn long-term dependencies. The most important reason for this is the vanishing gradient problem. LSTM networks have been introduced by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [57] to solve the problem of vanishing gradient, one of the major difficulties in performing long-term memory. Thanks to the gates (input, forget and output) in the LSTM, the model can be taught using backpropagation through time to avoid gradient problems.With this in mind, recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have been created by adding an internal memory to feedforward neural networks [55,56].

Thanks to the gates (input, forget and output) in the LSTM, the model can be taught using backpropagation through time to avoid gradient problems.</p>

        <p>As a final experiment in this study, we designed a CNN-LSTM model for both arrhythmia data and sequence learning. In this model, we have added an LSTM network with 32 memory units to the CNN-4. The structure and performance graphs of this model are presented in Fig. 12. When the values of the performance criteria for the CNN-LSTM model were examined (see Table 5), a 99.26% overall accuracy yielded a better result than other models. In addition, each epoch time of the CNN-LSTM model requires 294 seconds to complete, which is similar to that of the vanilla LSTM model. In general, although high performance (sensitivity, precision, and F1-Score) is obtained for all classes except for APB class. The recognition performance is better for classes such as NSR where the number of beats are more. Fewer number of data in other classes and the presence of inappropriate signals in the dataset may lead to misclassifications.

        <p>Few state-of-the-art ECG classification studies are given in Table 6. Deep learning approaches used in these studies are: deep neural networks (DNN) [31][32][33][34][35][36], denoising autoencoders (DAE) [5,[33][34][35][36], convolutional autoencoders (CAE) [29], CNN [1, 5 , 6, 8, 64, 38-40, 42, 45, 64], LSTM [39,29,58] and CNN-LSTM [3,10,62].

Researchers have proposed various approaches to deal with this situation. Acharya et al. [8] preferred to produce synthetic data to overcome imbalance data. These synthetic data were obtained by changing the standard deviation, and Z-score mean calculated from the original ECG signals. Jiang et al. [5] also produced synthetic data, but they oversampled the minority class data. They trained their model with unmodified balanced dataset, and then they fed the model with the unbalanced data to perform classification with fine-tuning process. Similarly, Lu et al.

Another significant difficulty in public datasets is that these datasets usually contain records of a small number of subjects for few classes.
