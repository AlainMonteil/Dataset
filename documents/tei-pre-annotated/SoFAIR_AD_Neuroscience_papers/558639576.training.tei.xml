        <p>Neuronal circuits require coordination between synaptic excitation (E) and inhibition (I) for proper function, 1,2 and disruptions in the excitatory-to-inhibitory (E:I) ratio contribute to epilepsy, 3 autism spectrum disorders, 4 and schizophrenia. 5 G-proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) tightly regulate the E:I ratio by linking agonists such as endocannabinoids (eCBs) to downstream signaling. 6,7 However, the exact nature of GPCR signaling often remains obscure. Understanding how GPCR agonists and antagonists influence these receptors, their downstream signaling pathways, and effector mechanisms would help clarify how CNS circuits are modulated.</p>
        <p>(À)-trans-cannabidiol (CBD), a major non-euphoric component in cannabis, can reduce seizure activity in multiple animal models 8 and in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsies. Efficacy in double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials in Dravet syndrome, [9][10][11] Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, 12 and tuberous sclerosis 13 led to FDA approval of highly purified, plant-derived CBD (Epidiolex in the US) for these disorders. In preclinical models, CBD reduces spontaneous recurrent seizures 14 and regulates the E:I ratio in acute seizures 15,16 ; however, the molecular signaling underlying CBD's anti-seizure actions remains poorly defined. 17 Possible therapeutic targets of CBD encompass ion channels, transporters, and transmembrane signaling proteins. 18 Among proposed candidates are two GPCRs: the cannabinoid receptor CB 1 R 19,20 and de-orphanized receptor GPR55. 21,22 CBD is proposed to act as a negative allosteric modulator of CB 1 R 19,20 ; however, the clinical relevance of this target remains uncertain, as CB 1 R antagonists are proconvulsive in most preclinical models. 8 CBD also acts a GPR55 antagonist, blocking the effects of the lipid lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), an endogenous GPR55 agonist. 21,23 LPI drives GPR55-mediated Ca 2+ flux at neuronal cell bodies 24 and presynaptic hippocampal CA3-CA1 (cornu ammonis) excitatory terminals, 20 producing an overall pro-excitatory effect. CBD blocks LPI-mediated presynaptic Ca 2+ rises, preventing elevated glutamate release. 22 LPI effects were abolished in GPR55 KO mice, suggesting agonist-receptor selectivity. 22 Further, a synthetic GPR55 inverse agonist occluded CBD action. 15,16 These observations implicate GPR55 as a substrate for some of CBD's anti-seizure actions.</p>
        <p>However, these studies leave many questions unanswered. Does CBD act on multiple neuronal types and, if so, how do these responses converge to affect excitability? Does CBD affect intrinsic excitability, and is synaptic strength altered preor postsynaptically? How do cellular mechanism(s) impact spike transmission in circuits, and how does signaling change after repeated seizures and chronic epilepsy?</p>
        <p>To address these questions, we focused on the LPI-GPR55 signaling pathway as a potential modulator of E:I ratio and anti-seizure target of CBD. We found that LPI triggers a GPR55-dependent dual mechanism to elevate network excitability: a transient elevation in presynaptic excitatory release probability, 22 complemented by a slower sustained reduction of inhibitory synaptic strength. Downregulation of postsynaptic GABA A receptors and gephyrin scaffolding drives attenuation of synaptic inhibition. Both LPI-mediated effects on synaptic transmission were blocked by GPR55 deletion or CBD pre-treatment. Acute seizures upregulated GPR55 expression and LPI production, strongly potentiating their combined pro-excitatory effects. Our observations suggest a positive feedback loop whereby LPI promotes hyperexcitability, which in turn increases the expression of LPI and GPR55. We propose LPI-GPR55 signaling as a potential target for CBD in reducing seizures, complementary to the direct effects of CBD on ion channels. 15,16,[25][26][27]</p>
        <p>We studied mechanisms of CBD action in the hippocampus, a key driver of temporal lobe seizures. 28 GPR55 was strongly expressed in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal layers derived from male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice, with lower expression in CA2 and the dentate gyrus (DG) granule layer (Figures 1A and1B; p CA1/CA2 = 0.033, p CA1/DG = 0.0002, p CA3/DG = 0.0006). Punctate GPR55 labeling also occurred in the CA1 stratum radiatum (S.R.), consistent with incoming CA3 Schaffer collateral axon terminals 22 (Figure S3A), although glial and postsynaptic expression cannot be excluded. Anti-GPR55 antibody labeling was greatly reduced in GPR55 KO mice (male B6;129S-Gpr55 tm1Lex /Mmnc), seen at low (103) and high (633) magnification (Figures 1A and1B; p &lt; 0.0001 for all regions), demonstrating antibody specificity. Thus, GPR55 is well-expressed at CA3 to CA1 inputs, supporting its role in regulating synaptic strength.</p>
        <p>To investigate GPR55 as a potential target for the anticonvulsant effects of CBD, we first studied an in vivo model of acute, generalized seizures in mice, using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 105 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) (Figure 1C). Administration of CBD (50, 100, 200 mg/kg, i.p., 1 h prior to PTZ injection) 29 produced a dose-dependent reduction in tonic-clonic seizures, reaching significance at 200 mg/kg, i.p. (n WT+VEH = 18/18 vs. n WT+CBD = 5/15, p &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, the seizure-reducing effects of CBD were absent in GPR55 KO mice, even at 200 mg/kg (n KO+VEH = 11/13 vs. n KO+CBD = 10/13 KO, p &gt; 0.9999). At 200 mg/kg, significantly more GPR55 KO mice had tonic-clonic seizures than WT mice (p = 0.03). Thus, dampening of behavioral seizures appeared to be GPR55-dependent.</p>
        <p>CBD reduced mortality both in WT (Figure 1D; n WT+VEH = 16/18 death vs. n WT+CBD = 0/15, p &lt; 0.0001) and KO mice (n KO+VEH = 10/13 vs. n KO+CBD = 0/13 KO, p = 0.0001), suggesting a potential GPR55-independent effect of CBD. To confirm that we did not miss covert electrographic seizures that contributed to mortality, we performed tungsten electrode recordings from CA1 and verified that electrographic seizure activity correlated with behavioral assays in WT (n = 3) and GPR55 KO (n = 3) genotypes (Figures S1A-S1C). Overall, these results suggested that GPR55 might play a key role in CBD's anticonvulsive effects, but potentially not seizure-induced mortality, prompting further study of CBD and GPR55 interaction.</p>
        <p>The striking effects of deleting the GPR55 receptor suggest that its endogenous agonist, LPI, promotes seizure-like activity. 22 To explore this, we tested LPI's effect on synaptically driven excitation at the CA3/CA1 (Schaffer collateral) input. Exposure to LPI transiently increased spike probability (Figure 1E; p = 0.038). This enhancement of excitation-spike coupling (Figure 1F) was prevented by 1 mM CBD pre-treatment (p ANOVA = 0.017, p LPI/LPI+CBD = 0.025) and absent in slices from GPR55 KO mice (p LPI-WT/LPI-KO = 0.021; Figure S1D; Table S1). Exposing hippocampal slices to LPI (4 mM) did not change the intrinsic frequency-current (F-I) relation (Figure 1G, n = 6) or spontaneous firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells (Figure 1H; Figure S1E; p = 0.74). Therefore, we predict that LPI elevates synaptic drive in a CBD-and GPR55-dependent manner, without affecting pyramidal cell intrinsic firing.</p>
        <p>CBD blocks the pro-excitatory and dis-inhibitory effects of LPI Feedforward CA3/CA1 signaling depends on both monosynaptic excitation (E/E) and disynaptic feedforward inhibition (E/I/E), prompting the examination of LPI's effects at each part of the microcircuit. In excitatory boutons, LPI releases Ca 2+ from presynaptic stores and transiently enhances glutamatergic transmission in a GPR55-dependent and CBD-sensitive manner. 22 We confirmed that LPI (4 mM) enhanced spontaneous neurotransmission, reflected by increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency in CA1 pyramidal neurons (Figures 2A 1 -2C 1 ; Figure S2A; p Freq = 0.0001), without changes in mEPSC amplitude (p Ampl = 0.30). Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) recorded at V rest in 1 mM tetrodotoxin (TTX) were unchanged immediately following LPI application (Figure 2 GPR55 receptor deletion eliminated the pro-excitatory and antiinhibitory effects induced by LPI (Figure 2, black traces; Figure S2). Slices from GPR55 KO mice showed neither an LPI-mediated increase in mEPSC frequency (p Freq = 0.54 vs. baseline) nor LPI-driven reductions in mIPSC frequency (p Freq = 0.47) and amplitude (p Ampl = 0.19). Thus, GPR55 KO had the same effect as CBD in most aspects of unitary synaptic transmission. A possible exception was basal mEPSC amplitude (Figure S2A), which appeared slightly larger in neurons from GPR55 KO mice (black, 26 ± 1 pA) than in WT (green, 22 ± 1 pA, p Ampl = 0.018), suggesting that GPR55 receptor deletion could have a developmental effect on excitatory synapses. 30 In contrast, the basal mIPSC amplitude (Figure S2C) was similar in GPR55 KO and WT recordings (p = 0.37).</p>
        <p>We next asked whether CB 1 Rs modulate LPI signaling through colocalization and heterodimerization with GPR55. 31 We tested this using an antagonist of CB 1 Rs, AM281, with minimal activity at GPR55 at 1 mM. 23 However, LPI's effects on excitatory and inhibitory transmission remained robust, with 1 mM AM281 (Figure 2C 1 ; p mEPSC-Freq = 0.048, aligned with prior studies 22 ; Figure 2C 2 , p mIPSC-Freq = 0.034; p mIPSC-Ampl = 0.016) weighing against LPI action via CB 1 Rs. Because CBD has multiple non-GPR55 targets, 18 we evaluated a role for GPR55 using the synthetic GPR55-selective inverse agonist CID16020046 (Figure 2C 1 ). Pre-treatment of slices with CID16020046 (2.5 mM) abolished the LPI-induced elevation of mEPSC frequency (p = 0.10) and prevented the anti-inhibitory effect of LPI on mIPSC frequency (Figure 2C 2 ; p = 0.44) and amplitude (p = 0.52).</p>
        <p>Although the pro-excitatory and anti-inhibitory effects of LPI had different time courses, both effects might rely on the GPR55-mediated discharge of intracellular calcium stores. Accordingly, we pre-depleted Ca 2+ stores via thapsigargin (10 mM), which completely blocked the LPI-induced responses (Figures 2C 1 and 2C 2 ), including mEPSC frequency (p = 0.76 vs. baseline), mIPSC frequency (p = 0.58), and mIPSC amplitude (p = 0.44). Therefore, LPI acts through CBD-sensitive GPR55 receptors to release intracellular Ca 2+ and thereby modify excitatory 22 and inhibitory synapses.</p>
        <p>We used Ca 2+ imaging to assess the effects of LPI on critical Ca 2+ stores. Because LPI does not increase mIPSC frequency (Figure 2B 2 ), we predicted that LPI might affect Ca 2+ stores in inhibitory presynaptic boutons differently than excitatory terminals. 22 Presynaptic Ca 2+ regulation in GABAergic terminals in GCaMP6f-expressing parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons (male PV-Cre 3 Ai148 mice) was assayed with two-photon Ca 2+ imaging, focusing on presynaptic terminals innervating CA1 pyramidal cell bodies. Presynaptic Ca 2+ in the GABAergic terminals was unaffected by LPI (4 mM, 3 min), yet reliably elevated by [K]-rich solution (Figure S2E). Thus, inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic terminals differ: LPI failed to discharge inhibitory presynaptic Ca 2+ stores, suggesting that it might act postsynaptically. 22,24 GPR55 expression at excitatory and inhibitory synapses Given the differing effects of LPI on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunocytochemistry (ICC) on hippocampal slices (Figure S3A) to assess the colocalization of GPR55 with presynaptic and postsynaptic markers: for excitatory synapses, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD-95); for inhibitory synapses, vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) and postsynaptic Gephyrin. GPR55 puncta colocalized more strongly with VGLUT1 than with the inhibitory presynaptic marker VGAT in both S.R. and stratum pyramidale (S.P.) (Figure S3A; p S.R. = 0.044, p S.P. = 0.020) and much more strongly with Gephyrin than VGAT (p S.R. = 0.014, p S.P. = 0.027). These observations suggest that GPR55 has a greater expression at postsynaptic inhibitory sites than inhibitory axon terminals, providing a rationale for the absence of LPI's effects on Ca 2+ transients in presynaptic GABAergic terminals (Figure S2E). However, these colocalization analyses are limited to the spatial resolution imposed by three-dimensional light microscopy ($200 nm XY).</p>
        <p>For better spatial visualization and less background fluorescence, we examined GPR55 localization at hippocampal synapses in dissociated cell cultures, using high-resolution confocal microscopy and demonstrated antibody specificity (Figure S3B). Cell culture studies reflected patterns seen in acute slice (Figures S3C-S3G). To exclude colocalization by chance alone, we scrambled GPR55 pixel locations along a 2D axon and compared colocalization levels to non-randomized conditions (Figure S3G; STAR Methods). GPR55 colocalized better than chance with VGLUT1 (p = 0.0002), PSD-95 (p &lt; 0.0001), and Gephyrin (p &lt; 0.0001), but not VGAT (p = 0.93). Thus, GPR55 colocalizes with excitatory synaptic markers and postsynaptic inhibitory markers, in line with the effects of GPR55 ligands on synaptic function.</p>
        <p>We examined potential colocalization of GPR55 and CB 1 Rs, 32 which are presynaptically localized, sensitive to cannabinoids, and regulators of synaptic activity. 33 CB 1 R can heterodimerize with GPR55 to reciprocally regulate cannabinoid signaling. 31 CB 1 R and GPR55 expression appeared to alternate along a single axon (Figure S3E, linescan), with rare colocalization (Figures S3A,S3E, and S3G) that was greater than chance alone (Figure S3G; p = 0.0061). Thus, GPR55 and CB 1 R largely occupy complementary domains along an axon but might occasionally colocalize or heterodimerize.</p>
        <p>After establishing that LPI modulates unitary synaptic currents via synaptic GPR55, we studied spike-evoked transmission in the CA3/CA1 microcircuit, recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons while stimulating Schaffer collateral axons in S.R. (Figure 3A 1 , 10 3 10 Hz). Inward excitatory currents were isolated in whole-cell voltage clamp recordings with cells held at E Cl ($À70 mV) to eliminate GABAergic IPSCs. Exposure to LPI (4 mM) caused a reversible 22% ± 6% elevation in the evoked EPSC amplitude during a 5 min window beginning 5 min post-LPI application onset (Figures 3A 1 -3A 3 ; p LPI/baseline = 0.021). Concurrently, the paired pulse ratio (PPR), the ratio of amplitudes of second-and first-evoked EPSCs, fell by 17% ± 3% (p LPI/baseline = 0.0092). Together, these effects suggest that LPI transiently elevates the probability of evoked excitatory transmitter release, consistent with observations that LPI elevates mEPSC frequency 22 (Figure 2B 1 ), field EPSP strength, 22 and long-term potentiation. 34 Pre-treatment with 1 mM CBD prevented the increased eEPSC amplitude (p ANOVA = 0.0078: p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.0057) and the reduced PPR (p ANOVA = 0.036: p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.042) (Figure 3A 3 ; Figure S4; Table S1). GPR55 deletion acted similarly (Figure 3A 3 ; Figure S4): eliminating LPI-driven changes in eEPSC amplitude (p WT/KO = 0.028) and in PPR (p WT/KO = 0.048; Table S1).</p>
        <p>We next asked how LPI affects disynaptic feedforward inhibition in CA1 (CA3-derived inputs/ interneurons/ CA1 pyramidal cells). Inhibitory synaptic currents (evoked IPSCs, eIPSCs) were isolated by holding CA1 pyramidal cells at the reversal potential EPSCs (E exc = $0 mV), stimulating Schaffer collaterals, and recording outward GABAergic currents (Figure 3B 1 , 10 3 10 Hz). Application of glutamatergic synaptic blockers (10 mM NBQX, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline, and 50 mM APV, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) abolished eIPSCs, confirming that outward eIPSCs were disynaptic (Figure S4C; p = 0.0051). After 25 min of exposure, LPI reduced eIPSC amplitude by 60%-70% (Figures 3B 1 -3B 3 ; p LPI/baseline = 0.0006), while dramatically elevating the eIPSC PPR (p LPI/baseline = 0.039). The LPI-mediated decrease in eIPSC amplitude was prevented by 1 mM CBD (Figure 3B 3 ; Figure S4D; Table S1; p ANOVA = 0.0022: p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.014) and absent in GPR55 KO slices (p WT/KO = 0.0018). Similarly, the elevated eIPSC PPR was blocked by CBD (p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.021) and not apparent in GPR55 KO slices (p WT/KO = 0.013). The temporal disparity between early transient elevation of EPSC amplitude (Figure 3A 1 ) and slowly developing attenuation of IPSC amplitude (Figure 3B 1 ) resembled the contrasting kinetics of changes in mEPSC frequency (Figure 2B 1 ) and mIPSC amplitude (Figure 2B 2 ). A similar pattern was evident in compound (E+I) synaptic currents (n = 9, Figure S4A), with an early elevation in E:I ratio that persisted following LPI washout (Figure S4A).</p>
        <p>The strong effects of LPI and CBD on feedforward inhibition motivated us to study the modulation of individual synaptic elements in the disynaptic circuit (Figure 4), focusing on PV+ interneurons, a key relay in feedforward inhibition. 35,36 Genetically labeled CA1 S.P. PV+ neurons from male B6;129P2-Pvalb tm1(cre)Arbr /B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze mice displayed characteristic brief membrane time constants and high frequency spiking patterns (Figure 4A 1 ; Figure S5A). LPI elevated mEPSC frequency in PV+ neurons after 5 min drug exposure, but not in the presence of CBD (Figure S5B). LPI also increased Schaffer collateralevoked EPSC amplitude (Figures 4A 1 - To isolate the LPI effects on PV+ I/E synapses onto pyramidal neurons, we used slices from PV-Cre/Ai32/ChR2 mice expressing channelrhodopsin in PV+ terminals (Figure 4B 1 , male B6;Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze /B6;129P2-Pvalb tm1(cre)Arbr ). Blue light activation of PV fibers in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (10 3 10 Hz) caused an outward, optically evoked IPSC (oIPSC) in CA1 pyramidal cells. LPI S5E; p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.59). Thus, LPI reduces monosynaptic inhibitory transmission from PV+ interneuron to CA1 pyramids via a likely postsynaptic mechanism. However, we cannot exclude a role for LPI in regulating PV+ neuron excitability through ion channel modulation, 15,16,[25][26][27] which could contribute to changes seen in disynaptic PPR (Figure 3B 2 ).</p>
        <p>To clarify molecular underpinnings of LPI and CBD actions at GABAergic inhibitory synapses, we examined effects on GABA A Rs, heteropentameric protein complexes trafficked to synapses via the inclusion of the g 2 subunit 37 and anchored by the gephyrin scaffold. 38 Neuronal cultures from Sprague-Dawley rats (both sexes) were exposed to 4 mM LPI, fixed 30 and 60 min later, and imaged using MAP2 as a dendritic marker. LPI reduced the intensity of GABA A R g 2 puncta below vehicle treatment controls at both 30 min (p ANOVA &lt; 0.0001; p VEH/LPI-30 = 0.0001) and 60 min (p VEH/LPI-60 = 0.0003) post application (Figure 5A; Table S1). The LPI-mediated decrease in GABA A R g 2 puncta intensity reversed after 10 min ACSF washout (Figure S6A; p LPI/WASH = 0.014). The GABA A R g 2 puncta density per unit dendrite area was reduced at 60 min but not at 30 min post-LPI (Figure S6B; p VEH/LPI-60 = 0.029).</p>
        <p>Similarly, LPI diminished the intensity of gephyrin puncta at 30 (p ANOVA = 0.0016; p VEH/LPI-30 = 0.0011) and 60 min (p VEH/LPI-60 = 0.032) post-LPI (Figure 5A; Table S1). Following a 10-min ACSF wash, gephyrin intensity overshot baseline levels (Figure S6A; p LPI/WASH = 0.0002, p VEH/WASH = 0.026). LPI reduced gephyrin puncta density only at 60 min post treatment (Figure S6B; p VEH/LPI-60 = 0.042). LPI left the percentage of receptor puncta that were colocalized with gephyrin unchanged (Figures S6C andS6D), suggesting that gephyrin and g 2 intensity decreased together. These data suggest that LPI diminishes both GABA A Rs and their gephyrin scaffold in synaptic puncta (consistent with lowered mIPSC amplitude; Figure 2B 2 ), before reducing puncta density (thus contributing to lessened mIPSC frequency; Figure 2B 2 ).</p>
        <p>Consistent with findings with synaptic transmission (Figure 3), CBD pre-treatment (1 mM) prevented the LPI-mediated reductions in GABA A R g 2 intensity (Figure 5A; Table S1; p LPI/CBD+LPI &lt; 0.0001) and GABAR g 2 puncta density per unit area (Figure S6E; p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.0001). Furthermore, CBD blocked the LPI-driven decreases in gephyrin intensity (Figure 5A; Table S1; p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.0007) and gephyrin puncta per unit area (Figure S6E; p LPI/CBD+LPI = 0.0005).</p>
        <p>To test whether LPI effects on inhibitory synaptic proteins were mediated by GPR55, we transfected cell cultures with GPR55-targeted shRNA; GPR55 protein expression was significantly reduced by shRNA (Figure S6F; p = 0.034) but not in scrambled shRNA controls (p = 0.89). Knockdown of GPR55 with shRNA transfection prevented the LPI-induced reduction of GABA A R g 2 intensity (Figure 5A; Table S1; p scr/shRNA = 0.0052) and g 2 puncta density (Figure S6G; p scr/shRNA = 0.0028) in comparison to cultures with scrambled shRNA controls. Similarly, shRNA knockdown of GPR55 blocked LPI-mediated decreases in gephyrin intensity relative to scrambled shRNA controls (Figure 5A; Table S1; p scr/shRNA = 0.0064) and in gephyrin puncta per unit area (Figure S6G; p scr/shRNA = 0.017). Comparing the effects of CBD and GPR55 shRNA, CBD coapplication with LPI (Figure 5A, middle right, red) produced a higher g 2 level than LPI+shRNA alone (black, p CBD+LPI/LPI-shRNA = 0.017). Together, these observations indicate that LPI decreased the postsynaptic expression of GABA A R g 2 and gephyrin within 30 min, with reduced puncta density after 60 min. These actions were blocked by CBD and likely mediated by GPR55.</p>
        <p>Possible signaling mechanisms linking GPR55 and GABA A R density A potential control point for LPI effects on GABA A R localization is activity-dependent dephosphorylation of g 2 serine 327, which increases lateral mobility of GABA A Rs away from gephyrin and destabilizes inhibitory synapses. 40,41 Exposure to LPI gradually reduced phosphorylation of g 2 S327 in western blots of wholecell lysates, reaching significance at 30 min (p = 0.0099) and 40 min (p = 0.0033) post LPI (Figure 5B). In contrast, LPI did not significantly alter b 3 S408/409 phosphorylation (Figure S6H), an activity-dependent regulator of GABA A R endocytosis, 42 suggesting that LPI effects on GABA A R might be subunit-specific. Treatment of cultures with 1 mM CBD blocked the LPI-mediated decrease in GABA A R g 2 S327 dephosphorylation (Figure S6I; p = 0.0027).</p>
        <p>We tested a hypothetical mechanism linking GPR55 to g 2 S327 dephosphorylation. GPR55 is a G q -linked 24 or G a12/13linked 23,43 GPCR; when signaling via G a13 , GPR55 communicates to RhoA and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) to discharge internal Ca 2+ stores. 39 Blockade of ROCK with YM-27632 (10 mM) prevented the LPI-mediated dephosphorylation of g 2 S327 (Figure 5B; p = 0.76). LPI-induced S327 dephosphorylation remained robust with the blockade of PLC (10 mM U73122, p &lt; 0.0001) or PKC (LPI + 0.1 mM bisindolylmaleimide II p = 0.024). However, LPI g 2 S327 dephosphorylation was prevented by depleting intracellular Ca 2+ stores with thapsigargin (10 mM; p = 0.76), inhibition of IP 3 Rs with xestospongin C (1 mM; p = 0.41), and calcineurin blockade (10 mM cyclosporine A, p = 0.22), but not PP1a inhibition (5 nM tautomycetin, p = 0.0002). Together, these findings suggest that LPI, communicating via GPR55 and ROCK, signals in a PLC-independent manner to release intracellular Ca 2+ stores, activate calcineurin, and dephosphorylate GABA A R g 2 S327, thus dispersing GABA A R clusters (Figure 5B schema).</p>
        <p>If LPI-GPR55 signaling shifts the E:I ratio toward hyperexcitability, potentially favoring seizure activity, could seizures reciprocally regulate the LPI-GPR55 axis? To address this, we assessed GPR55 expression $30 min following acute PTZ-induced seizures. Injection of PTZ in WT mice (105 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a prominent, region-specific elevation in GPR55 immunostaining (Figures 6A and6B; Table S1), with the highest increases in areas CA1 (p ANOVA = 0.014: p Non-Sz+VEH/SZ+VEH = 0.031) and CA3 (p ANOVA = 0.027: p Non-Sz+VEH/SZ+VEH = 0.044), and a non-significant elevation in DG (p ANOVA = 0.07). In vivo pre-treatment with CBD (200 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h prior to giving PTZ prevented the seizure-induced rise in GPR55 expression (Figures 6A and6B; Table S1; CA1 p SZ+VEH/Sz+CBD = 0.0069, CA3 p SZ+VEH/Sz+CBD = 0.034). To crosscheck immunostaining data, we probed levels of hippocampal Gpr55 mRNA by quantitative PCR using newly designed primers demonstrating specificity in KO controls and no associated genomic DNA contamination (Figures S7A and Similarly, lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR55 (black, sh, n shRNA = 5) deterred effects of LPI on GABA A R g 2 (p scr/shRNA = 0.0052) and gephyrin (n scr = 5, p scr/shRNA = 0.0064), relative to scrambled shRNA controls (gray, scr, n scr = 5). CBD co-application with LPI produced a higher g 2 level than LPI+shRNA alone (p CBD+LPI/LPI-shRNA = 0.017). (B) LPI reduced (g 2 phospho-S327)/(total g 2 expression) in whole hippocampal lysates (n = 8 for all, p LPI-30 = 0.0099; p LPI-40 = 0.0033). LPI-mediated S327 dephosphorylation was reversed by inhibitors (n = 4 for all) of RhoA-activated protein kinase (ROCK) (10 mM YM-27632, p = 0.76), IP 3 Rs (1 mM xestospongin C, p = 0.41), and calcineurin (10 mM cyclosporin, p = 0.22), and by depletion of intracellular calcium stores (10 mM thapsigargin, p = 0.76). However, LPI-mediated effects remained intact in the presence of inhibitors of phospholipase C (10 mM U73122, p &lt; 0.0001), protein kinase C (0.1 mM bisindolylmaleimide II, p = 0.024), and PP1a (5 nm tautomycetin, p = 0.0002). Right, biochemical scheme based on literature 24,39 consistent with pharmacological data. S7B). Assessment of Gpr55 mRNA by qPCR supported immunostaining data, with a 60% increase in transcripts following PTZ treatment, which were more than fully reversed by CBD pre-treatment (Figure 6C; Table S1; p ANOVA &lt; 0.0001: p Non-Sz+VEH/Sz+VEH = 0.021, p Sz+VEH / SZ+CBD &lt; 0.0001, p Non-Sz+VEH/Sz+CBD = 0.0060). Thus, ICC and qPCR both showed that seizures elevate GPR55 expression acutely post-seizure induction, with effects blocked by CBD pre-treatment.</p>
        <p>To assay LPI levels after seizures, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry targeting LPI isoforms (Figures 6D and6E; Figures S7C andS7D; Tables S1 andS2). The level of 1-stearoyl LPI (C18:0), the predominant LPI component in brain, 45 was increased 30 min post-PTZ-induced seizure (p ANOVA = 0.0086: p Non-Sz+VEH/Sz+VEH = 0.031), an elevation prevented by CBD pre-treatment 1 h prior to PTZ (p Sz+VEH/Sz+CBD = 0.0097). Levels of other LPI isoforms (20:4 and 16:0) remained unchanged. Our findings of hyperactivity-induced elevations in GPR55 and its endogenous ligand LPI suggest a positive feedback loop (Figure 6F) that upregulates excitatory and downregulates inhibitory synaptic strength. These synaptic effects could work autocatalytically to promote circuit excitability, producing a vulnerable self-propagating system. By antagonizing LPI activation of GPR55, CBD counteracts LPI's pro-excitability action, lowering GPR55 and LPI levels and dampening the positive feedback. Additionally, CBD could also dampen excitability through a GPR55-independent effect on excitatory ion channels, [25][26][27] which could restrain activity-dependent GPR55 gene expression and LPI release. 22 We predict that these putative mechanisms operate at different stages to act synergistically, enabling CBD to attenuate electrographic seizure activity.</p>
        <p>To assess CBD's role in electrographic seizures, we employed a PTZ model, 44 in a refinement of our earlier protocol (Figures 1C and1D; Figure S1). We placed electrodes to capture a larger spatial range of electrographic activity in frontal, temporal (hippocampus), and occipital lobes, and used a lower concentration of PTZ (60 mg/kg) as a milder stimulus that would not cause status epilepticus. Pre-treatment with 200 mg/kg CBD decreased average EEG power (Figures 6G and6H; Figures S7E andS7F; log(power): p = 0.0036), increased the latency to first electrographic seizures (Figure 6I, p = 0.04), and produced a non-significant trend toward abbreviation of EEG seizure duration (p = 0.11). Thus, CBD reduced electrographically recorded seizures, consistent with our hypothesis (Figure 6F). In these animals, CBD also limited behaviorally observed seizures rated over Racine stages 1-6 (Figure 6K, p = 0.047).</p>
        <p>We next asked whether a seizure-induced rise in GPR55 could potentiate LPI's effect in a chronic model of epilepsy. We used a low mortality, high morbidity model of lithium-pilocarpine (Li-PLC)-induced status epilepticus in male Wistar-Kyoto rats 46 in which CBD given during the epileptogenic period reduced chronic seizure burden 14 (Figure 7A; see STAR Methods). Following status epilepticus, epileptogenesis was determined using a validated post-seizure behavioral battery (PSBB) test; only animals with PSBB scores &gt;10 following a 10-week period were used for experimental study. 46 At 3-6 months after Li-PLC-induced epileptogenesis, there was a non-significant rise in Gpr55 mRNA (55% ± 29%) relative to non-epileptic age-matched controls (Figure 7B; Table S1; p ANOVA = 0.19), with greater experimental variability potentially due to lower Gpr55 expression in rats vs. mice (Figure S8A; p rat/mice = 0.0043). However, GPR55 protein expression, assessed by IHC at 203 resolution, roughly doubled in CA1, CA3, and DG following Li-PLC epileptogenesis (Figure 7C; Table S1; CA1 p ANOVA = 0.024: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.020; CA3 p ANOVA = 0.027: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.028; DG p ANOVA = 0.0084: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.014). CBD 200 mg/kg delivered p.o. (per orem) ) during the weeks following confirmation of epileptogenesis prevented GPR55 elevation in all three areas (Figure 7C; Table S1; CA1 p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.042, CA3 p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.042, DG p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.0096). In CA1 S.R., a locus of synaptic inputs onto CA1 neurons, the normalized intensity of GPR55 colocalized with excitatory nerve terminals marked by VGLUT1 was enhanced $4-fold following Li-PLC induction (Figure 7D; Table S1; p ANOVA = 0.0069: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.006), but not if CBD was given orally following the period of epileptogenesis (p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.022). A similar pattern was seen in S.P. (Figure S8B), where axons originating in area CA3 also course. 47 Li-PLC epileptogenesis induced a 27% ± 8% increase in GPR55 puncta intensity at presumed postsynaptic inhibitory sites labeled with gephyrin in S.P., an effect prevented by chronic p.o. CBD (Figure 7E; Table S1; p ANOVA = p = 0.0007: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.04, p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.0004). A comparable effect was seen in the S.R. (Figure S8C). The intensity of GPR55 puncta colocalized with VGAT, a presynaptic marker of inhibitory synapses, was nearly doubled following Li-PLC administration (Figures S8D andS8E), effects prevented by CBD, p.o. in S.R. (Figure S8D), but not in S.P. (Figure S8E). Simultaneously, major LPI isoform levels (18:0, 20:4, and 16:0) were unchanged following Li-PLC epileptogenesis (Figure S8F; Table S2; 18:0 p ANOVA = 0.20; 20:4 p ANOVA = 0.45, 16:0 p ANOVA = 0.76). In hippocampal tissue, the concentration of 18:0 LPI [LPI] was $0.1-1 mM in rat, slightly lower than prior reports of [LPI], 45 while roughly 100-to 1,000-fold lower than [LPI] detected in mouse (10-100 mM, Figures 6D and6E; Table S2). Collectively, Li-PLC-induced epileptogenesis increases GPR55 protein levels, but not the agonist LPI, for several months following induction; increases were prevented by chronic CBD treatment.</p>
        <p>The pro-excitatory effects of exogenous LPI in acute slices, taken $3 months after recurrent seizure induction, were strongly potentiated relative to non-epileptic controls (Figure 7F). The LPI-mediated rise in mEPSC frequency was greater in slices from Li-PLC-treated animals, an increase prevented by chronic in vivo treatment with CBD 200 mg/kg given p.o. following epileptogenesis (Figure 7F; Table S1; p ANOVA = 0.0099: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.038; p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.0087). The potentiation by LPI also persisted for at least 20 min following washout (p ANOVA = 0.01: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH p = 0.012, p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD p = 0.034). The mEPSC amplitude remained unchanged throughout (Figures S8G andS8H, p ANOVA = 0.26). LPI produced a greater dis-inhibitory response in mIPSC amplitude in epileptic vs. non-epileptic controls, effects prevented by in vivo CBD p.o. treatment (Figure 7G; Table S1; p ANOVA = 0.0032: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.0017, p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.047), whereas LPI did not diminish mIPSC frequency (Figures S8I andS8J; p ANOVA = 0.95). LPI's effects on excitatory and inhibitory currents (legend continued on next page) were blocked by ex vivo acute pre-treatment of slices with 1 mM CBD (mEPSCs, Figure 7H, p = 0.76; mIPSCs, Figure 7I: p = 0.77). Together, our data indicate that Li-PLC epileptogenesis increases GPR55 protein expression, potentiates synaptic responses to LPI, and prolongs LPI's effect on mEPSC frequency. All these post-epilepsy changes were abolished by orally delivered CBD (Figures 7F and7G), in accord with the blocking of the Li-PLCinduced elevation of GPR55 (Figures 7D and7E), consistent with the posited in vivo positive feedback loop (Figure 6F).</p>
        <p>To evaluate the contribution of the GP55-LPI axis to seizure susceptibility with more precise temporal control, we examined GPR55 changes 4 and 48 h following injection with kainic acid (KA), a chemoconvulsant model of temporal lobe seizures, 48 (STAR Methods). We chose a two-pulse protocol to determine whether a peri-threshold dose, slightly below that required to consistently elicit seizures, might lead to seizures if repeated days later. We predicted that the first dose (''KA1'') might initiate a rise in GPR55, as in the positive feedback proposal (Figure 6F), which could then lower the seizure threshold for an identical KA dose days afterward (''KA2'').</p>
        <p>Hippocampal Gpr55 mRNA expression was elevated by 70% at 48 h following the first largely subconvulsive dose of KA (KA1, 24 mg/kg, subcutaneous [s.c.]) (Figure 8A; Table S1; p ANOVA = 0.018: p Non-Sz+Veh/KA1+Veh = 0.039). In contrast, no significant change was seen 4 h after KA1 (p = 0.86). Giving CBD (200 mg/kg) 1 h prior to KA1 (CBD1) prevented the rise in GPR55 mRNA at 48 h (p KA1+Veh/KA1+CBD1 = 0.039). In the same animals used for qPCR, no significant difference appeared in KA1 seizure incidence following administration of CBD1 vs. VEH1 (3/6 animals each, p = 0.11). Consistent with qPCR findings, IHC revealed an increase in GPR55 intensity in hippocampal CA1 and CA3, 48 h post KA1 administration, effects prevented by CBD treatment 1 h prior to KA1 (Figure 8B; Table S1; CA1 p ANOVA = 0.02: p Non-Sz+VEH/KA1+VEH = 0.040, p KA1+VEH/KA1+CBD1 = 0.048; CA3 p ANOVA &lt; 0.0001: p Non-Sz+VEH/KA1+VEH = 0.0006, p KA1+VEH/KA1+CBD1 = 0.0001; DG p ANOVA = 0.09).</p>
        <p>Consistent with elevated GPR55 expression 2 days after the initial KA challenge, we found that more animals exhibited tonic-clonic seizures after a second KA dose (14/15) than after KA1 (2/15, p &lt; 0.0001; Figure 8C). CBD administration reduced the incidence of second-pulse seizures when given 1 h prior to the second KA2 pulse (CBD2: 1/6, p = 0.0017), potentially due to CBD's acute anti-seizure effect. However, CBD also reduced KA2 seizure incidence when given before the first priming, subconvulsive KA1 dose, 48 h prior to the second KA dose (CBD1: 3/6, p = 0.05). The effect of CBD1 on second-pulse seizures (48 h later) suggests an enduring effect on cellular signaling, not just acute dampening of excitability (Figure 6F) that would readily reverse over the 48 h prior to KA2, given the in vivo half-life of CBD injected i.p. ($4-9 h). 29 Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that seizure-induced increases in GPR55 lower the threshold for subsequent seizures (Figure 6F). CBD blockade of increased GPR55 (Figure 8A) provides a potential mechanism for anti-seizure action (Figure 8C), although further study using GPR55 KO mice is warranted in order to confirm correlative findings.</p>
        <p>CBD restores E:I ratio and disrupts seizure-induced LPI-GPR55-mediated positive feedback loop Our experiments provide new insights on synaptic mechanisms of CBD's anti-seizure effects. CBD prevented the LPI-driven, GPR55-mediated shift in E:I ratio favoring hyperexcitability. Effects of LPI occurred via two complementary mechanisms: a prompt rise in presynaptic excitatory transmission 22 followed by a gradual and prolonged reduction in postsynaptic inhibitory strength. By blocking both LPI effects, CBD curbed increases in E:I ratio that would drive hippocampal circuits toward hyperexcitability. Further, we discovered that acute PTZ seizures increase GPR55 and LPI expression, and slices from animals with Li-PLC-induced epileptogenesis display exaggerated LPI responsiveness, consistent with potentiated GPR55 activity. We propose a pathogenic positive feedback loop (Figure 6F), hypothesized as E:I regulation gone awry, that provides one of several potential targets for the seizure-reducing effects of CBD (Figures 6,7, and 8). Our findings complement and extend earlier in vitro data demonstrating that CBD (1) blocks LPI-mediated increases in excitatory synaptic weights 22 and (2) upregulates intrinsic firing of PV+ interneurons and spontaneous IPSC frequency. 15,16 LPI mediates and CBD prevents reduced inhibitory synaptic weight through GABA A R modulation LPI reduced inhibitory synaptic weight by dispersing GABA A R g 2 and its scaffolding partner gephyrin. LPI's effects at inhibitory synapses were absent in GPR55 KO slices, blocked by CBD, and dependent on intracellular calcium stores, consistent with findings at excitatory synapses. However, unlike GPR55-mediated enhancement of excitatory transmission, which was presynaptically expressed and strikingly transient 22 (Figures 2 and3), GPR55-dependent downregulation of inhibitory postsynaptic weights developed gradually and lasted 25-30 min post-LPI (F) Pro-excitatory ex vivo effects of the GPR55 agonist LPI were potentiated in slices from rats following Li-PLC-induced epileptogenesis (filled light green circles) in comparison to non-epileptic controls (unfilled light green circles), effects prevented by chronic in vivo treatment with CBD p.o. (filled dark green circles). Vertical axis, normalized values relative to pre-LPI baseline; mEPSC freq: (n CTRL = 9, n Li-PLC+VEH = 9, n Li-PLC+CBD = 7; p ANOVA = 0.0099: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH = 0.038; p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD = 0.0087). The potentiated effects of LPI also persisted following washout (p ANOVA = 0.01: p CTRL/Li-PLC+VEH p = 0.012, p Li-PLC+VEH/Li-PLC+CBD p = 0.034).

(H and I) Acute CBD (1 mM) blocked LPI effects on both mEPSC frequency (H) and mIPSC amplitude (I) in both Li-PLC slices and non-epileptic controls. application. LPI reduced GABA A R phosphorylation at g 2 S327, a phosphorylation site regulating g 2 subunit lateral movement from gephyrin to extrasynaptic sites, 37,40,41 corresponding to a slow, progressive decreases in mIPSC amplitude and frequency. Our data align with findings demonstrating several forms of inhibitory synapse plasticity via g 2 dephosphorylation. 40,49,50 We found that S327 dephosphorylation depended on IP 3 R-mediated calcium release, calcineurin, and RhoA/ROCK kinase, 40,41 but not phospholipase C (Figure 5B). 43 We predict that LPI might activate IP 3 Rs directly, 51 bypassing PLC-mediated IP 3 formation, to drive Ca 2+ release and CaN activation, prompting future biochemical studies. Beyond effects on g 2 , LPI reduced the intensity and number of gephyrin puncta, which regulates synaptic localization of GABA A R g 2 -containing heteromers. 52,53 Immunolabeled puncta of g 2 and gephyrin diminished together, as if LPIinduced changes in g 2 and gephyrin operate coordinately to disperse inhibitory complexes and decrease mIPSC frequency, inhibitory weights, and IPSC amplitude. In ex vivo hippocampal slices, GPR55 puncta were found in the pyramidal cell layer, representing presumptive gephyrin-labeled inhibitory synapses, although effects on excitability, cell structure, cell-cell interac-tions, or excitatory synapses, given colocalization with PSD-95, are also possible (Figure S3).</p>
        <p>By elevating presynaptic glutamate release and reducing inhibitory synaptic strength, LPI shifts the E:I ratio toward hyperexcitability, providing a powerful transient signal amplifier. This contrasts with the stabilizing "circuit breaker" function of eCBs, which counteracts excess network activity by reducing both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic release. 6,33,54,55 Similarly, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid related to LPI, stabilizes synaptic circuits by depressing presynaptic excitatory release and reducing inhibitory tone by disaggregating postsynaptic GABA A R. 41 Thus, while eCBs and LPA generally weaken excitation and inhibition together, LPI reduces postsynaptic inhibitory weights while elevating glutamate release. LPI's actions strongly increase the E:I ratio, enabling LPI to powerfully amplify incoming signals following activity-dependent stimulation. We propose that eCBs, LPI, and LPA serve as strategic (C) Effects of 2 nd dose of KA administered 48 h post KA1 (KA2, 24 mg/kg, s.c.). Behavioral seizures assessed via modified Racine scale, 2 h after KA1 or KA2 (timing of assays, dashed vertical lines), followed by injection with diazepam 10 mg/kg, s.c. Although 2/15 animals demonstrated convulsive seizures (as defined as 3-4 on Racine scale) following KA1, a significantly greater proportion displayed KA-induced seizures after KA2 (14/15, p &lt; 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). CBD (200 mg/kg, s.c.) reduced the frequency of convulsive seizures following KA2 when CBD was administered 1 h prior to KA1 injection (CBD1, p = 0.05) or 1 h prior to KA2 (CBD2, p = 0.0017). There was no significant difference between KA1 seizure incidence with CBD1 or VEH1 administration (p = 0.11, data not shown).</p>
        <p>control points for the modulation of brain excitability, as these lipid modulators are enzymatically interconnected. 7 Acute PTZ-induced hyperexcitability increased levels of the major LPI isoform (18:0), 45 consistent with multiple evidentiary lines for activity-dependent enhancement of LPI generation and release. First, LPI synthesis partially depends on secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2), 7 a Ca 2+ -dependent enzyme 56 whose levels are elevated by seizures. 57 Second, PLA2-driven LPI synthesis/ release is likely elevated by bursts of presynaptic firing, reflected by effects of CBD and inhibitors of PLA2. 22 Third, CBD efficacy increases with graded neuronal depolarization, consistent with depolarization-induced LPI release. 16 These data suggest that stimulus-driven, phasic release of LPI provides a short-lasting signal that in moderation enhances information transfer and circuit function. However, following seizure-induced elevations, GPR55's neuromodulatory control could lead to the proposed pathological positive feedback (Figure 6F), magnifying and prolonging LPI's pro-excitatory effect (Figure 7F). Genetic evidence supports the pathological potential of LPI: epilepsy and intellectual disability arise from inactivating mutations in LPI acyltransferase, the enzyme that converts LPI to its PI precursor. 58 Elevated LPI-GPR55 signaling is a target of CBD's antiseizure action To evaluate GPR55 as a potential target for CBD's anti-seizure actions, we assessed multiple rodent models of acute seizures and chronic epileptogenesis, each with advantages and drawbacks. As acute seizure models, we used proconvulsants PTZ (a GABA A R antagonist to model disinhibition; Figures 1 and6) and KA (a GluR agonist) to model temporal lobe seizures (Figure 8). Acute PTZ seizure induction upregulated GPR55 at both mRNA and protein levels, 30 min following PTZ injection (Figures 6B and6C), and acutely elevated the 18:0 isoform of LPI (Figure 6E). Further, Gpr55 mRNA increased 48 h following a single dose of KA, consistent with elevated ''second-pulse'' seizure susceptibility (Figure 8). Seizure-induced increases in GPR55 expression were prevented by CBD pre-treatment at doses that yielded anti-seizure effects in vivo (200 mg/kg, Figure 1C). A relatively higher dose of CBD was selected due to multiple factors including pharmacokinetics following acute delivery, rapid distribution of lipid soluble CBD into hydrophobic tissue, and a species difference brain:plasma concentration ratio in mice relative to other species (see Epidyolex EMA Assessment 2019). 29 CBD's anticonvulsive effects on PTZ-induced seizures were absent in GPR55 KO mice (Figure 1C), consistent with GPR55's role in seizure generation and CBD antagonism of GPR55 (Figure 6F). A potential confound is that PTZ-induced seizures were more prevalent in GPR55 KO mice than would be expected in comparison to peak CBD suppression in WT animals (Figure 1C). This difference might arise from GPR55's absence during development, when LPI-GPR55 signaling contributes to axon pathfinding and synapse maturation. 30,59 Hints of possible compensatory effects were evident in unitary excitatory synaptic weights, which were greater in GPR55 KO than WT slices (Figure S2A). To address this potential confound, future studies could examine conditional deletion of GPR55 later in development.</p>
        <p>We also studied spontaneously recurrent seizures using Li-PLC induction in rats and found that GPR55 protein expression was persistently elevated several months following the epileptogenic insult (Figure 7C). GPR55 protein levels in hippocampal regions doubled relative to age-matched controls, but not if CBD was given orally during the epileptogenic period at doses that reduce chronic seizure burden. 14 Epileptogenesis triggered a non-significant, variable increase in Gpr55 mRNA compared with acute PTZ-treated mice (Figure 6B), potentially due to lower Gpr55 mRNA in rat vs. mice (Figure S8A) or differences in seizure model. A rise in GPR55 protein (IHC), but not mRNA, could be attributable to post-transcriptional changes in GPR55, including activity-dependent alterations in endocytosis and surface expression as previously reported with CB 1 Rs, 60 or obscuring of region-specific changes in whole hippocampal qPCR. Consistent with GPR55 elevation at excitatory and inhibitory synaptic loci (Figures 7D and7E; Figures S8B-S8E), corresponding synaptic responses to exogenous LPI were strikingly enhanced (Figures 7F and7G), but absent with CBD. We applied CBD at 1 mM, sufficient to antagonize GPR55 (IC 50 445 ± 67 nM), 23 in line with peak plasma levels (&gt;1 mM) in Dravet syndrome patients receiving CBD long term (20 mg/kg 3 21 days). 61 In the rat Li-PLC model, animals are euthanized several months following the initial epileptic insult, agnostic to the last acute seizure; transient activity-dependent changes in acute LPI release might elude detection. Indeed, levels of LPI assessed in the hippocampus of epileptic rats were not significantly different than non-epileptic controls (Figure S8F). The lack of detectable change in LPI could be due to experimental limitations of lipid isolation or inability to capture fleeting postseizure changes in LPI, possibly paralleling transient (&lt;$1 h) seizure-induced elevation in eCBs. [62][63][64] Future studies could determine whether exogenous LPI suffices to lower threshold for recurrent seizures.</p>
        <p>We tentatively propose that CBD can extinguish a potentially regenerative loop in which hyperactivity enhances LPI-GPR55 signaling, further shifting the E:I ratio (Figure 6F). Our conceptual framework incorporates additional non-GPR55-dependent actions, such as a role for CBD reducing excitability via direct effects on ion channels, [25][26][27] and direct effects of CBD on the synthetic enzyme that produces LPI, PLA2. 65,66 Non-GPR55 targets might explain why CBD reduced seizure-induced mortality in both WT and GPR55 KO mice (Figure 1D) and exerted effects on GABA A Rs above that of GPR55 knockdown alone (Figure 5A), as if CBD also acted directly on GABA A Rs. 67 Further candidates for CBD's anti-seizure effects 17,18 include transient receptor potential (TRP) channel (TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPA1) agonism, [68][69][70][71] CB 1 R negative allosteric modulation, 19,20 as well as inhibition of ENT-1 adenosine transporter, 72 CaV3.3 channels, 73 mitochondrial VDAC1 channels, 74 and regulation of non-neuronal cells (e.g., glia). In addition, GPR55 could also play a non-synaptic role in regulating ion channel conductances in interneurons, 16 especially PV+ interneurons 15,16,75 through effects of Na V channels. We propose that CBD might act on non-GPR55 targets to regulate network excitability, opposing potential stimuli that ''engage'' the hyperactivity-induced feedback loop as described in Figure 6F. However, effects on such non-GPR55 targets that rely on the immediate presence of CBD are unlikely to explain partial efficacy against KA seizures that persisted 48 h after CBD administration (Figure 8C), long after brain levels declined. Further evaluation of these candidate targets at clinically relevant CBD doses is needed.</p>
        <p>A mechanism for CBD synergy with GABA A R modulation CBD provides a potential therapeutic agent in treatment-resistant epilepsy patients who did not respond to GABA A R modulators (e.g., benzodiazepines), 76 possibly due to LPI-GPR55 effects. Our evidence suggests that hyperactivity could trigger LPI-driven synaptic disinhibition, further lowering the threshold for recurrent seizures. GABA A R g 2 , the target of GPR55 action, has previously been implicated in multiple prior models of seizures. Surface g 2 levels are decreased in preclinical models of Li-PLC-induced status epilepticus, 77 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, 78 and pediatric epilepsy with febrile seizures. [79][80][81] Thus, LPI-mediated reduction in g 2 and gephyrin levels may be proconvulsive, phenocopying g 2 mutations causing epilepsy, reducing GABAergic synaptic strength, and further limiting benzodiazepines' full impact. By restoring GABA A R cluster abundance, CBD might reestablish benzodiazepine efficacy, thus contributing to CBD's clinical efficacy in combination therapy with benzodiazepines, 82,83 beyond possible pharmacokinetic interactions on drug metabolism. 84,85</p>

The craniotomy was capped with a mixture of mineral oil (one part) and dental wax (three parts), and a Faraday cage was constructed using copper mesh and connected to the cerebellar ground wire. Following surgery, an opioid analgesic was injected (Buprenex at 0.06 mg/kg, 0.015 mg/ml, i.m.) and given as needed for the next 1-3 days. Recording Three insulated tungsten wires (0.002'' California Fine Wire, CA) were glued together and cut at a 45⁰ angle. These were then mounted to a screw and soldered to a header pin (Mill-Max, NY). Signals were digitized at 30 KHz with the Intan amplifier board (RHD2132/ RHD2000 Evaluation System, Intan). Mice were allowed at least a one week post-implantation recovery before electrodes were lowered into place. CA1 ripples (150 -200Hz oscillation) were used to identify correct placement prior to experimentation. At least one day was allowed between electrode placements and seizure induction. On the day of seizure induction, mice were placed in their home cage, and the position was monitored by a USB webcam synchronized with the neural recordings through a blinking LED. First, CBD (200 mg/kg i.p.) was injected, followed 1 h later by injection of PTZ (105 mg/kg i.p.). Recordings were made for at least 30 minutes or until death. Analysis Behaviorally observed seizure state was classified independently based on neural activity and on behavior using the Racine scale. 86 Electrographic events were characterized in 30 second time blocks as one of four classifications: (1) Normal: normal EEG background without epileptiform discharges, seizures, or slowing; (2) Epileptiform discharges 87 clusters of &gt;2 spikes, with absolute value of LFP amplitude larger than 4 standard deviations of the LFP recorded throughout, spike duration less than 75 ms in duration as measured by the width at half max, and no evolution over the duration of 30 s time window; (3) Seizures 88 high amplitude, rhythmic trains of high frequency complex discharges lasting for a minimum of 5 s; (4) Post-ictal suppression: LFP values in the bottom decile of LFP values recorded throughout the experiment. Spectrograms were made in MATLAB v2018b (Mathworks, MA) using Morlet wavelets on the down-sampled (1250 Hz) local field potential from the recording site with the largest amplitude ripples.</p>
        <p>Induction of lower dose pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice (Figure 6) Methods were performed as previously described. 44 In brief, male Swiss Mice weighing 18-25 g (Taconic, Germantown, NY) were used. Four total electrodes were placed over left frontal, right occipital and bilateral hippocampi. Animals were treated subcutaneously (s.c.) with either vehicle (ethanol: kolliphorÒ: 0.9% saline=1:1:18; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) or 200 mg/kg CBD (plant-derived highly purified, generously provided by GW Research Ltd, Cambridge, UK). One hour later, animals were injected with pentylenetetrazol (60 mg/kg s.c.; Sigma-Aldrich, UK). During seizure induction, mice were monitored using a webcam synchronized with the EEG recordings. Seizure behavior was analyzed by a blinded observer using Racine scale as described. 86 Electrographic activity was analyzed with 
            <rs type="software">Sirenia</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">2.2.1</rs>; Pinnacle) or Spike 2 (v
            <rs type="version">7.</rs>12; Cambridge Electronics). Recordings were analyzed for latency to the first abnormal event (epileptiform activity or seizure), seizure duration, and power. Power Spectrograms were made in 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> (v
            <rs type="version">2018b</rs>;

        <p>Using a recently described model of low-mortality, high-morbidity status epilepticus, 46 male (P&gt;21) Wistar-Kyoto rats (Charles River) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with lithium-chloride (127 mg/kg) 24 hours before pilocarpine treatment, to sensitize them to the seizurogenic effects of pilocarpine. 30 minutes prior to pilocarpine treatment, animals were injected with methylscopolamine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK; 1 mg/kg; s.c.), a peripherally restricted muscarinic receptor antagonist that minimizes the peripheral effects of pilocarpine (salivation etc.). Pilocarpine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK; 25 mg/kg; s.c.) was administered at 30-min intervals until bilateral rearing and falling (Racine stage 3.5) was observed. Xylazine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK; 2.5 mg/kg; s.c.) was then injected to inhibit motor movement during seizures. Following 60 minutes of sustained seizure activity, animals were injected with ''STOP'' solution (1 ml/kg; s.c.), consisting of diazepam (Sigma-Aldrich, UK; 2.5 mg/kg), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK; 20 mg/kg), and dizoclipine (MK-801; Sigma-Aldrich, UK; 0.1 mg/kg) to prevent further seizures. During the 2 weeks after induction, regular animal welfare checks were performed. Epileptogenesis was determined using a previously validated post-seizure behavioral battery (PSBB) test, and only animals with PSBB scores &gt;10 following a 10 week period were used for electrophysiology and IHC. 46 In the weeks following the establishment of epileptogenesis, rats were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 200 mg/kg CBD or vehicle (3.5% kolliphor Ò HS, Sigma) as per. 14 All drugs were administered in drinking water to reduce the incidence of spontaneous seizures with epileptic animals during frequent handling. Two-Pulse Kainic Acid (KA) Seizure Induction For the ''KA1'' pulse, WT C57Bl6 mice (2-3 months, male and female) received either CBD (200 mg/kg) or CBD vehicle (ethanol: kolliphorÒ: 0.9% saline=1:1:18; Sigma-Aldrich), followed by kainic acid (KA, Sigma, 24 mg/kg in normal saline, s.c.) 1 h later. Behavioral seizures were then scored based on a modified Racine scale 86 : 0 -Grooming, moving, normal; 1 -Freezing, splayed limbs, sloppy movements; 2 -Ear twitching, head nodding; 3 -Unilateral arm jerks; 4 -Bilateral arm jerks, with stages 3-4 identifying convulsive seizures. Animals were then given diazepam (Hospira, Inc, 10 mg/kg, s.c.) 2 hours later to prevent status epilepticus. For qPCR experiments, 48 h following KA1 injection, animals were sacrificed and brains were rapidly frozen for mRNA extraction. For those receiving the ''KA2'' pulse, 48 h following KA1, a second dose of CBD or vehicle (concentrations as above), followed by KA (as above) was given. Behavioral seizures were again assayed as per the modified Racine Scale.</p>
        <p>Electrophysiology slice preparation (for mice, all except Figure 7) GPR55 KO or littermate control mice 2-3 months old, male and female, were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (150 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and perfused transcardially with an ice-cold sucrose solution containing (in mM): 206 Sucrose, 11 D-Glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH 2 PO 4 , 10 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 and 26 NaHCO 3 . Following perfusion and decapitation, brains were removed and placed in the cold sucrose for sectioning before gluing to the stage of a Leica VT 1000S Vibratome. Transverse, 350 mm sections of left and right hippocampi were cut and transferred to an oxygenated, 34 C recovery chamber filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 122 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 D-Glucose, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2 CaCl 2 , 1.3 MgCl 2 , and 26 NaHCO 3 . Slices were allowed to recover for 1 h at 34 C and were then maintained at room temperature in oxygenated ACSF for 1-6 h before recording.</p>
        <p>Electrophysiological recordings (for mice, all except Figure 7) Hippocampal slice recordings were performed in a submerged chamber maintained at 32-34 C with a constant bath perfusion of ACSF (with or without pharmacological agents) at $4 mL/min. Slices equilibrated in the chamber for &gt;10 minutes before recording. Whole cell and cell-attached recordings were made with borosilicate glass pipettes pulled on a Sutter Instrument P-97 micropipette puller. Tip resistance ranged between 2-5 MU following fire polishing to enhance seal quality.</p>
        <p>For voltage clamp recordings of spontaneous and evoked EPSCs, the intracellular solution contained (in mM): 130 CsMeSO3, 6 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 Tris-Phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP. Spontaneous IPSCs onto pyramidal cells were recorded in voltage clamp using a high Cl-internal solution containing (in mM): 70 CsMeSO 3 , 35 CsCl, 15 TEA-Cl, 1 MgCl 2 , 0.2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 10 Tris-Phosphocreatine, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na-GTP, with ACSF glutamatergic blockers 10mM NBQX and 50 mM APV. For mEPSC and mIPSC recordings, 1mM TTX was added to ACSF. For disynaptic IPSC experiments, cells were held at 0mV and stabilized for at least 10-15 minutes prior to recording. For synaptic stimulation recordings, stimulating electrodes were placed in the stratum radiatum, and a 10x 10Hz frequency train was delivered, with either 15s (eEPSCs) or 30s (eIPSCs) between trains.</p>
        <p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed on neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, identified visually with an upright microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2 FS Plus) using infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics. For all experiments involving lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) application, cells were recorded in regular ACSF for 10-15 minutes, followed by LPI (4 mM, Sigma in DMSO vehicle) for 30 minutes, and a subsequent 10-15 minute washout period. In a subset of experiments, plant-derived highly purified CBD (GW Research Ltd, Cambridge, UK, 1mM in DMSO vehicle) was added for 20 minutes prior to concomitant LPI treatment (CBD+LPI).</p>
        <p>Data were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered at 10 kHz using a Bessel filter and digitized at 20 kHz with a Digidata 1322A analogue-digital interface (Axon Instruments). mEPSCs and mIPSCs were analyzed using 
            <rs type="software">Clampfit</rs> software, and evoked EPSCs/IPSCs were identified offline using a custom analysis script developed in 
            <rs type="software">MATLAB</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">Mathworks</rs>). Passive properties were continuously monitored during recordings, and all cells with V m &lt;-55 mV, Series Resistance (R s ) &gt; 25MU, or significant changes in R s during the course of the recording, were excluded from analysis.
        </p>
        <p>Electrophysiology slice preparation (for rats, Figure 7 only) Healthy and epileptic male rats (p&gt;66) were decapitated under deep isoflurane anaesthesia (4% w / v in O 2 ), and their brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing (in mM): 130 NaCl, 24 NaHCO 3 , 3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1.5 MgSO 4 , 10 glucose saturated with 95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 , at pH 7.3. Transverse slices (350 mm thickness) including hippocampus were cut using a Vibroslice (Campden instruments Ltd., Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK) and transferred to a nylon mesh where they were maintained submerged in a chamber containing ACSF at 33 C for 30 min. Slices were then maintained at room temperature (18-22 C) in ACSF (95% O 2 / 5% CO 2 ).</p>
        <p>Prior to extraction, samples were moved from -80 C storage to dry ice and weighed into 2.0 mL screw cap vials containing $100 mL of disruption beads (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL). Each sample was normalized to 46 mg/mL using 100% methanol (Fisher Scientific) and homogenized for 10 cycles on a bead blaster homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific, Edison, NJ). Cycling consisted of a 30 sec homogenization time at 6 m/s followed by a 30 sec pause. In glass LC vials, 80 mL of Optima LC/ MS grade water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was combined with 80 mL of homogenate. Further extraction was performed by adding 160 mL of 100% chloroform and vortexing for 2 min. Entirety of sample was transferred to glass inserts and spun at 21,000 g for 3 min at 4 C. For analysis, 20 mL of each sample was transferred to LC/MS vials containing glass inserts. LC-MS/MS targeted LPI method Standards of 16:0, 18:0 and 20:4 LPI (Avanti Polar Lipids) were prepared in ethanol at 1uM, 3uM, 10uM, 30uM, and 100uM and used to validate retention time and fragmentation pattern for each LPI. Samples were analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS with a targeted product reaction monitoring (PRM) method for 16:0, 18:0 and 20:4 LPI. The LC column was a Waters TM BEH-C18 (1.0 x 50 mm, 1.7 mm) coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 TM system and the column oven temperature was set to 25 o C for the gradient elution. The flow rate of 0.1 mL/min was used with the following buffers; A) 60:40 acetonitrile:water, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid and B) 90:10 isopropanol:acetonitrile, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% formic acid. The gradient profile was as follows; 50-100%B (0-2.0 min), hold at 100% B (0.5 min), 100-50%B (2.5-3 min), hold at 50%B (3.0 min). Injection volume was set to 1 mL for all analyses (6 min total run time per injection). MS analyses were carried out by coupling the LC system to a Thermo Q Exactive HF TM mass spectrometer operating in heated electrospray ionization mode (HESI). Method duration was 6 min with a PRM scan in negative mode only. Global list for PRM contained [M-H] -theoretical masses for targeted LPIs. Spray voltage for was 3.5kV and capillary temperature was set to 320 o C with a sheath gas rate of 25, aux gas of 10, and max spray current of 100 mA. Tandem MS scans utilized 30,000 resolution with a maximum IT of 100 ms, isolation window of 0.4 m/z, isolation offset of 0.1 m/z, and normalized collision energies (nCE) of 35. The minimum AGC target was 2e5 with an intensity threshold of 1e6. All data were acquired in profile mode. Duplicate standard curve points and samples were randomized for sequence injection. Standard curves were generated for each LPI. For quantitation, a background of 3x the average blank signal plus 10,000 counts was applied. Sample quantities were calculated using linear regressions to determine on column amount of each LPI. Assuming 100% extraction efficiency, calculated values were used to determine amount of LPI per mg of tissue.</p>

For PTZ-induced seizure and mortality incidence, Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests were used. For electrophysiological and molecular biological data, distributions passing Shapiro-Wilk test for normality were compared using a two-way student's t-test. Non-Gaussian distributions were compared using the non-parametric tests Wilcoxon signed rank test. For recordings pre-and post-drug application within a given cell, paired t-tests were used for comparisons. Events were normalized to the mean PSC frequency or amplitude during a 5 min window of baseline. For in vitro LPI experiments, intensities were normalized to the average of the vehicle-treated condition. For 3 or more independent comparisons (including electrophysiological recordings, HPLC, qPCR, ICC, and immunoblots), a one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc testing (e.g. Dunnett's or Bonferroni's) was performed. Differences were considered significant at p % 0.05.

WT mice age P24-P90 were used for experiments as further described in the methods below. For cell culture experiments, male and female SAS Sprague-Dawley rat (Charles River #400) P0 pups were utilized. PV interneurons were identified with parvalbumin (PV)-Cre (B6;129P2-Pvalb tm1(cre)Arbr /J, Jax Strain #017320) line crossed with a Ai9/TdTomato expressing lines (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze /J, Jax Strain #007909). For optogenetic experiments involving PV+-mediated inhibition, PV-Cre mice were crossed with an Ai32 line expression channelrhodopsin 2 EYFP fusion protein (B6;Cg-Gt(ROSA) 26Sor tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze /J, Jax Strain #024109). For transgenic mice experiments in PV-Ai9 and PV-Cre/Ai32/ChR2 mice, both male and female mice age P60-90 were used for electrophysiological experiments. Male Wistar-Kyoto rats (&gt;P21, Charles River #008) were used for studies involving lithium pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus at the University of Aston (UK). All rats were maintained in 12h:12h dark:light cycle, a room temperature of 21 C and humidity of 50±10 %, with ad libitum access to food and water. The experiments were performed in accordance with UK Home Office regulations (Animals Scientific Procedures Act, 1986). Male Swiss mice weighing 18-25g (Taconic, Germantown, NY, Model SW-M) were used for electrographic pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures (Figure 7) as previously described. 44 Primary Cell Cultures Hippocampal neurons were cultured from postnatal day 0 male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups. The hippocampus was isolated in ice-cold HBSS (Corning) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and washed in HANKS without serum. Following washing, hippocampi were digested for 8 min. in a 1 ml papain solution (Papain dissociation System, Worthington). 50 units of DNase I (Millipore Sigma) and 0.5 mM MgCl 2 was added at the end of Papain digestion. Digestion was stopped by adding 5 ml of modified HBSS containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After additional washing, the tissue was dissociated using Pasteur pipettes of decreasing diameter. The cell suspension was pelleted and plated on 10 mm coverslips coated with poly-D-lysine in 24-well plates for ICC, or directly onto PDL-coated 12 well plates for western blot studies. The cultures were maintained in NbActiv4 (BrainBits, Springfield, IL). A 50% medium change was performed at 7 days, and once per week thereafter. Neurons were used for experiments 12-14 days in vitro (DIV) after plating.</p>
        <p>Induction of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice (Figure 1) During a pre-experimental baselining period, animals were randomized for treatment, and treatment groups were balanced within litters to the extent permitted by individual litter size, sex, and genotype distribution. Male GPR55 +/+ (n=40) and GPR55 -/-(n=40) mice, aged P24-28 and weighting 25-40g, were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with vehicle (ethanol: kolliphorÒ: 0.9% saline=1:1:18; Sigma-Aldrich, UK) 1h before receiving i.p. administration of PTZ (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) at 85, 95, 105 or 115 mg/kg (n=10 per group) dissolved in saline (0.9% (w/v) NaCl). During the 30 min following PTZ injection, the number of animals exhibiting fully developed tonic-clonic seizures with loss of righting reflex and/or death was calculated.</p>
        <p>Acute slices were secured under a nylon mesh, submerged, and superfused with ACSF in a chamber mounted on the stage of an upright microscope (Scientifica, UK). Slices were visualized with a 403/0.1 NA water-immersion objective coupled with infrared and differential interference contrast (DIC) optics linked to a video camera (digital camera Orca 03G, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan).</p>
        <p>Electrophysiological recordings (for rats, Figure 7 only) Somatic whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (at $33 C) were made from visually identified cells using borosilicate glass capillaries (GC150F-10; Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Kent, UK) using a P1000 Flaming Brown Micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments Co., California, USA) and filled with a filtered intracellular solution consisting of (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 10 HEPES, 0.3 Na 2 -GTP, 10 Na 2 -phosphocreatine, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Resistance of the patch pipettes was 5-6 MU. Recordings were accepted only if the initial seal resistance was &gt;1 GU and series resistance did not change by more than 20% throughout the recording period. No correction was made for the junction potential between the pipette and the ACSF. Pyramidal neurons were distinguished from interneurons by the localization of their somata in CA1 stratum pyramidale, a lower input resistance, a higher membrane constant, a smaller fast after-hyperpolarization and adapting, &lt;20 Hz maximum firing rates. Intracellular signals were digitised to a computer with an A-D converter (Digidata 1500, Molecular Devices) and monitored during experiments with 
            <rs type="software">Clampex</rs> software (
            <rs type="creator">Molecular Devices</rs>). All electrophysiological signals were amplified (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular devices), low pass filtered at 10 kHz, digitized at 20 kHz.
        </p>
        <p>In recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs; voltage-clamp), the AMPA receptor component was isolated by adding 0.1 mM CGP 55845 (Abcam, UK), 100 mM D-APV (Abcam, UK), 500 mM MCPG (Abcam, UK), 1 mM strychnine (Sigma Aldrich, UK), 20 mM Bicuculline (Abcam, UK), 500 nM AM281 (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and 1 mM TTX (Tocris, UK) in the ACSF. GPR55 receptors were activated by applying 4 mM LPI (Sigma Aldrich, UK). In some experiments plant-derived highly purified CBD (GW Research Ltd, Cambridge, UK) was added to the ACSF at a final concentration of 1 mM. The DMSO concentration never exceeded 0.01% w / v .</p>
        <p>To image GCaMP6f confined to PV+ interneuron terminals (Figure S2E) we used acute hippocampal slices derived from male PV-Cre x Ai148 mice. Images were focused at the stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in the CA1 hippocampus. The field of view was imaged at 30 Hz by using a resonant scanner-based two-photon microscope (Sutter), and individual frames were subsequently averaged before analysis. 4 mM LPI was washed onto slices for $3 min, followed by 25 mM KCl for $1 min as a positive control to ensure the integrity of axon terminals to flux Ca 2+ . Calcium responses were measured as a ratio of DF/F 0 , with F 0 representing basal fluorescence measured before LPI application.</p>
        <p>A subset of cultures were transfected at 3DIV (MOI=5) with 4 custom designed lentiviral, GFP+ shRNA constructs (Origene) targeting GPR55 with the following sequences, along with scrambled controls: Immunostaining For all cell culture experiments involving LPI treatment, cells were treated for 1 hour with pre-warmed 4mM K Tyrode's solution consisting of (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2 MgCl 2, 2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, and synaptic blockers 1mM TTX, 10mM NBQX, and 50 mM APV. 4mM LPI, or DMSO vehicle, was then applied in Tyrode's solution with synaptic blockers. Cultured cells were then fixed at 30 or 60 minutes post drug application in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS supplemented with 20 mM EGTA and 4% (w/v) sucrose. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% normal donkey serum, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies (see table below). The next day, cells were washed with PBS, incubated at room temperature for 50 min with Alexa secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes), washed with PBS (3x5 min) and mounted using with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with or without DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>
        <p>For all experiments involving ex vivo hippocampal brain slices, animals were perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Whole brains were dissected and fixed overnight in 4% PFA, and then sucrose-protected overnight in 30% sucrose in PBS before embedding and freezing in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek O.C.T.) for sectioning. Frozen sections were cut on a cryostat at 16 mm and collected on HistoBond coated slides (VWR) for staining. Sections were blocked for 2-3 hours at room temperature in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% normal serum, then incubated at 4 C in primary antibodies (see chart below). Sections were rinsed and then incubated in species-appropriate Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, 1:500) for 2-3 hours, and finally mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with or without DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific). Fluorescent images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 meta Imager.M1 confocal microscope at 10x, 20x, or 63x magnification.</p>
        <p>Images were analyzed for both average puncta intensity and colocalization using custom analysis

            <rs type="software">Icy</rs> (
            <rs type="url">http://icy. bioimageanalysis.org</rs>) software. 89 Regions of interest (ROI) were traced around apical dendrites labeled by MAP2 or axons labeled by tau. For puncta colocalization analyses, immunoreactive puncta for GPR55 and synaptic markers (e.g. VGLUT1, VGAT) were separately detected with sub-pixel accuracy, in 3D, and in an automated manner using the 'Spot Detector' plugin of ICY (scale 2, threshold = 100). Puncta were determined to be ''colocalized'' with a threshold of 250 nm in the horizontal (XY) plane and 500 um in the depth (Z) plane, based on average pixel sizes of 120 nm XY and nm Z, respectively. The 3D colocalization ratio was then computed as: (#colocalized GPR55 puncta + #colocalized marker puncta)/(total # GPR55 puncta + total #marker puncta). In order to gain a statistical insight on the estimated correspondence between puncta, we adopted a Monte Carlo simulation approach in which we aimed at building the probabilistic distribution of the colocalization ratio under the null hypothesis that the protein GPR55 is uniformly distributed along the axon and that colocalization with synaptic markers occurs only by chance. We randomly redistributed the location of GPR55 immunoreactive puncta along the axon in 2D after detection, while keeping their number fixed. Briefly, using the tau (axonal) or MAP2 (dendritic) fluorescence ROIs in 2D, we traced a series of linked 2D segments and orthogonally projected the detections for the two proteins along them so that a detection with 3D coordinates (x, y, z) is then represented by a single value (t) corresponding to the 1D distance to the tip of the traced axon/dendrite. We then computed the colocalization ratio as before in this coordinate system (colocalization threshold = 250 nm). For simulated data, we performed 10 4 trials in which the location of synaptic marker puncta remained fixed to preserve the spatial distribution of the protein, while GPR55 detections were randomly uniformly redistributed along the axonal segment. For each axonal segment, we compared the averaged simulated colocalization ratio with the measured one and we statistically pooled data from multiple coverslips using a paired t-test.

        <p>Cells were harvested and lysed (Lysis Buffer A, Thermo) with EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo) following treatment with 4mM LPI (see immunostaining above for description). In a subset of studies, samples were treated with pharmacological blockers (see table below), and lysed at various times post LPI application. Sample proteins were equalized using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) and loaded into 10-20% SDS-PAGE gel with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol following heating at 95 o C for 5 min. Cellular protein was transferred to Immobilon transfer membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then blocked at room temperature for 2 hrs in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), and incubated with primary antibodies (see table below). The following day, the membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated with an IRDye-labeled secondary antibody (Li-Cor) for 1 hr. After incubation, the membrane was washed with PBS and imaged with Odyssey imaging systems. All the bands were analyzed with

        <p>Total RNA extraction and qPCR For the PTZ (105mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizure model, one hippocampus was dissected out on ice and used for total RNA extraction at the time point either immediately after seizure-induced death, or 30 minutes after PTZ/vehicle treatment, whichever came first. For KA-induced seizure model, one hippocampus was dissected out on ice 48 hours following either KA (24 mg/kg, i.p., ''KA1'') or vehicle. For both PTZ and KA experiments, CBD (200 mg/kg) was administered 1 h prior to chemoconvulsant induction in a subset of animals. RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat#74104) was used to extract total RNA as per manufacturer instructions. Total RNA was eluted in 30 ml of RNase-free water and concentration was measured using nanodrop. SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific #18080044) was used for reverse transcription of 1 mg (for the PTZ experiments) or 500 ng (for the KA experiments) total RNA from each sample following the user manual. qPCR was performed with SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad# 1725272) using 1 ml cDNA as template. Mouse Gpr55 qPCR primers were designed to span an intron and were confirmed with non-RT control to make sure there is no genomic DNA interference (Figures S7A andS7B), and all PCR products were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Two internal control genes (Hmbs and Sdha) were used with geometric averaging to ensure accurate normalization. 90 For the qPCR assay of Li-PLC-induced seizure model in rats, hippocampi were dissected 3-6 months following establishment of epileptogenesis with age-matched non-epileptic controls, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. One half of a hippocampus ($30 mg) from each rat was used to extract total RNA using the RNeasy Mini Kit. To eliminate genomic DNA contamination, column-purified RNA were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, AM2224) at 37 o C for 30 minutes followed by 75 o C inactivation for 10 minutes and column cleaning. Non-RT controls, in which no reverse transcriptase was added in the reverse transcription reaction, were run for all samples to monitor the level of genomic DNA contamination in the case of all-isoform Gpr55 qPCR. We tested different promoter usages of rat Gpr55 and used primer 10&amp;11 (below) in Figure 7B.</p>
