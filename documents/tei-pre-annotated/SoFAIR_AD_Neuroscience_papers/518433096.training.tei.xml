        <p>Background: Remimazolam is a new benzodiazepine for procedural sedation and general anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to characterise its pharmacokinetic properties and safety in renally and hepatically impaired subjects. Methods: Two separate trials were conducted in patients with hepatic (n¼11) or renal impairment (n¼11) compared with matched healthy subjects (n¼9 and n¼12, respectively). The hepatic impairment trial was an open-label adaptive 'Reduced Design' trial, using a single bolus of remimazolam 0.1 mg kg À1 i.v., whereas the renal impairment trial was an open-label trial of a single bolus dose of remimazolam 1.5 mg i.v. Remimazolam plasma concentrations over time were analysed by population pharmacokinetic modelling. Results: Remimazolam pharmacokinetic properties were adequately described by a three-compartment, recirculatory model. Exposure in subjects with severe hepatic impairment was 38.1% higher (i.e. clearance was 38.1% lower) compared with healthy volunteers. This increase caused a slightly delayed recovery (8.0 min for healthy, 12.1 min for moderate, and 16.7 min for severe hepatic impairment). With renal impairment, plasma clearance was comparable with that measured in healthy subjects. Simulations of C max after a bolus dose of 10 mg showed no relevant impact of hepatic or renal impairment. The overall incidence of adverse events was low, and all adverse events were mild. Conclusions: As C max after a remimazolam bolus i.v. was not affected by hepatic or renal impairment, no dose adjustments are required. No unexpected adverse events related to remimazolam were seen in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment.</p>
        <p>Remimazolam is a new ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine for procedural sedation and general anaesthesia. The pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of remimazolam were characterised in renally and hepatically impaired subjects compared with normal volunteers. Remimazolam pharmacokinetic properties were described by a three-compartment recirculatory model, with no relevant impact of hepatic or renal impairment and a low incidence of adverse events.</p>
        <p>Remimazolam has predictable pharmacokinetic properties, and does not require dose adjustments in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment.</p>
        <p>The selection of a safe and effective dose of sedative-hypnotics drugs for general anaesthesia and procedural sedation in patients with hepatic or renal impairment is challenging. Decreased elimination properties in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction may lead to difficulties in anaesthesia management and postoperative recovery. 1,2 Many intravenous sedatives and anaesthetics show a different pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, potentially resulting in increased exposure to the parent drug or a metabolite. The half-life of benzodiazepines, for example can be twice as long in patients with hepatic failure compared with healthy subjects, whereas codeine or meperidine should be avoided in patients with severe renal impairment because of narcolepsy, respiratory arrest, etc. caused by accumulation of metabolites because of reduced renal elimination. 12 As a consequence, careful dose adjustment may be required.</p>
        <p>Remimazolam (PAION, Aachen, Germany), an ultra-shortacting intravenous benzodiazepine, represents an alternative in the search for a safe shorter-acting anaesthetic providing sedation combined with fast onset and rapid recovery. 3e6 Remimazolam is rapidly metabolised to an inactive metabolite by liver esterases, specifically by CES-1A. This metabolite is the only clinically relevant metabolite of remimazolam e it is the only metabolite that accounts for more than 10% of drugrelated material at steady state.</p>
        <p>To investigate the PK and safety of remimazolam, two clinical trials were conducted in patients with hepatic or renal impairment and compared with healthy subjects.</p>
        <p>Both trials were conducted in human volunteers not undergoing any procedure or surgery and in accordance with the applicable national and International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines, consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. 7e9 Protocols with amendments and consent form were reviewed and approved by the Chesapeake Institutional Review Board (hepatic impairment trial)/Hungarian and Institutional Ethics Committees (renal impairment trial) and were registered with US National Library of Medicine (NCT01790607) and EudraCT (2014-004575-23), respectively. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before any protocol-specific procedures were carried out.</p>
        <p>This trial was conducted at three sites in the US: (1) Compass Research, Orlando, FL, USA; (2) MRA Clinical Research, South Miami, FL, USA; and (3) Anaheim Clinical Trials, Anaheim, CA, USA. It was an open-label, single-adaptive 'Reduced Design' trial planned to be carried out in three parts. Reduced design implies that initially subjects with moderate hepatic impairment were compared with subjects with normal hepatic function and, in case no clinically meaningful difference was seen, an assessment of mildly hepatic impaired subjects was deemed unnecessary. Hepatic impairment was classified using the ChildePugh Score. 10 Part 1 was conducted in eight subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (ChildePugh scale score of 7e9) and nine healthy matched subjects; Part 2 was not required as a 2-fold or greater exposure (area under the concentrationetime curve [AUC] or maximum observed concentration [C max ]) difference of remimazolam between moderately hepatically impaired subjects and matched healthy subjects had not been observed; Part 3 was conducted in three subjects with severe hepatic impairment (ChildePugh scale score of 10e15). The dose for these subjects was based on the assessment of PK and safety results for the moderate hepatic impairment cohort (Part 1).</p>
        <p>An investigation of PK and safety of remimazolam in patients with renal impairment was conducted in a phase No formal sample size calculation was performed; the number of subjects per group was based on experience with similar studies examining other drugs and on feasibility.</p>
        <p>Patients were screened within 28 days before dosing in the hepatic impairment trial and within 21 days before dosing in the renal impairment trial. Male and female subjects aged 18e65 yr (hepatic impairment trial) or 75 yr (renal impairment trial) with BMI of 18.0e35.0 kg m À2 inclusive were eligible. Female subjects could be enrolled if they were documented to be surgically sterile, postmenopausal, practicing true abstinence, or were using highly effective contraception methods for at least 28 days before dosing until 30 days after drug administration and had a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and Day e1. Healthy subjects were matched to their respective renally or hepatically impaired subject with respect to sex, age, and BMI. Age was allowed to deviate within a range of plus or minus 5 yr and BMI within plus or minus 15%. Except for conditions associated with renal impairment (renal impairment trial) or liver disease (hepatic impairment trial), subjects were excluded if they presented with clinically relevant abnormal histories, abnormal findings on physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or laboratory tests at the pre-trial screening assessment that the investigator judged as likely to interfere with the objectives of the trial or the safety of the volunteer. Subjects with a history of benzodiazepine use within the previous five elimination half-lives were excluded. Use of any over-the-counter, non-prescription preparations (including vitamins, minerals, and phytotherapeutic/herbal/ plant-derived preparations) within 7 days was prohibited, unless deemed acceptable by the investigator, sponsor, sponsor's medical monitor, or both. Participation in any other investigational drug trial in which an investigational drug was used within 28 days or five half-lives, whichever was longer, was an exclusion criterion. Subjects with a history of drug abuse within the past 2 yr were excluded, and subjects were not permitted to consume alcohol within 48 h before or during the trial.</p>
        <p>Once enrolled, and after a minimum 10 h overnight fast, each subject in the hepatic impairment trial received a single dose of remimazolam 0.1 mg kg À1 i.v. (range, 5.2e16.2 mg), whereas the renal impairment trial patients were treated with a single dose of remimazolam 1.5 mg i.v. on the morning of Day 1. The dose for the hepatic impairment trial was chosen to be within the sedative range and to correspond to an average induction dose as used in clinical trials for general anaesthesia. Because of the mainly liver-based metabolism of remimazolam, it was hypothesised that moderate to severe hepatic impairment might impact remimazolam PK and pharmacodynamics (PD). In contrast, renal impairment was expected to affect only the PK of the inactive metabolite of remimazolam, but not the PK or PD of remimazolam itself, which in healthy subjects is found only in traces in urine. The dose for the renal impairment trial was therefore chosen to permit reliable PK profiling while avoiding a sedative effect.</p>
        <p>Blood samples for the determination of total plasma concentrations of remimazolam and its de-esterified metabolite (CNS7054) were taken before dosing and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after dosing from arterial blood in the hepatic impairment trial, and for remimazolam and CNS7054 before dosing and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 min and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after dosing from venous blood in the renal impairment trial. Samples were analysed with high-performance liquid chromatography using tandem mass spectrometry detection with a lower limit of detection of 2 ng ml À1 and a linear range of 2e2000 ng ml À1 . Within-run imprecision was 6.6% and accuracy was 99.7e113.6%. D4-labelled internal standards were used for both remimazolam and CNS7054.</p>
        <p>In parallel, safety variables were also assessed. Adverse event (AE) monitoring, recording of concomitant medications, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, safety laboratory tests (haematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential only) were performed at screening (before dose), during PK assessment and at discharge/followup. Subjects were discharged on Day 2, and a follow-up visit was performed on Day 7 in hepatic impairment trial subjects and Day 5 [2] days in renal impairment trial subjects, respectively.</p>
        <p>In the hepatic impairment trial, the number of subjects with loss of consciousness (LOC, defined as Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale [MOAA/S] &lt;2), the duration of LOC, and the time to recovery of consciousness (time from the end of administration to the last point when the trial subject was fully awake) were summarised by hepatic function group.</p>
        <p>We estimated the PK of remimazolam based on concentration vs time data using the LAPLACE-I estimation algorithm in 
            <rs type="software">NON-MEM</rs>® (version 
            <rs type="version">7.4</rs>; 
            <rs type="creator">GloboMax LLC</rs>, Hanover, MD, USA). The '
            <rs type="software">tidyverse</rs>' package (version 
            <rs type="version">1.1.1.</rs>; Wickham H. 2017) in 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>® (
            <rs type="creator">R Foundation for Statistical Computing</rs>, Vienna, Austria) was used to graphically assess the goodness-of-fit (GOF) of the candidate models and for simulations. Data below the quantification limit (BQL) were handled according to the 'M3' method. 11 As a starting point to simultaneously describe the arterial and venous PK of remimazolam, three different structural PK models were fitted to the data. These models were the recirculatory PK model for remimazolam, 12 the recirculatory PK model for AZD3043, 13 and a three-compartment mammillary model with an effect compartment to characterise the delay between arterial and venous samples. 14 Inter-individual variability on the typical population parameter estimates was assumed to be log-normally distributed. Residual unexplained variability was modelled using a combined proportional and additive error model. Inclusion of covariates in the model was driven by graphical evaluation of the relationship between random effects (ETAs) and the covariates. Covariates tested for inclusion in the model were weight (kg), age (yr), estimated creatinine clearance according to CockcrofteGault (eCLCR; ml min À1 ), 15 sex, and ChildePugh score. 10 Modifications to the model were accepted only if they resulted in a significant decrease in the objective function value (i.e. DOFV &lt;e3.84 for one additional parameter). Nonnested models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Internal model validation was based on GOF plots based on the normalised prediction distribution errors (NPDEs) 16 and a prediction-variance-corrected visual predictive check (pvcVPC) according to Bergstrand and colleagues. 17 All model parameters are reported as typical values with associated 95% confidence intervals derived from the covariance matrix of parameter estimates in 
            <rs type="software">NONMEM</rs>®. Secondary PK parameters were analysed descriptively. AEs were captured throughout.
        </p>
        <p>A total of 20 subjects were recruited for the hepatic impairment trial (eight with moderate, three with severe, and nine with no hepatic impairment; see Supplementary Table S1) and 23 subjects for the renal impairment study (11 with end-stage renal disease [5 had eGFR of &lt;15 ml min À1 ], and 12 subjects with normal renal function [10 had eGFR !90 ml min À1 ]; see Supplementary Table S2). All enrolled patients completed the trials (Table 1). In both trials, healthy subjects were matched individually by sex, age, and BMI to subjects in the moderately hepatically or renally impaired group.</p>
        <p>Within each trial, subject characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1). Renally or hepatically impaired subjects used prior and concomitant medication for treatment of the underlying disease (e.g. allopurinol, spironolactone, or furosemide), for the control of associated conditions (e.g. perindopril for hypertension), or both. Subjects who received at least one dose of study medication were included in the safety population, whereas the PK population comprised all subjects who received one dose of remimazolam and provided sufficient bioanalytical assessments to calculate reliable estimates of plasma clearance. Accordingly, four subjects (three with renal impairment, one with normal renal function) were excluded from the PK population in the renal impairment trial because of non-detectable levels of remimazolam in their plasma samples, or because of protocol violation (Table 1).</p>
        <p>Figure 1 shows the measured total plasma concentrations of remimazolam for both trials. Remimazolam concentrations in the hepatic and renal impairment trials are from arterial and venous samples, respectively. The figure suggests that exposure increases with degree of hepatic impairment.</p>
        <p>Remimazolam in hepatic or renal impairment -417</p>
        <p>Although remimazolam was dosed per kg body weight in the hepatic impairment trial, the per kg dosing cannot explain the apparent difference in total exposure as the average dose given across cohorts was similar (i.e. 9.0, 10.4, and 8.2 mg for healthy volunteers, moderate hepatic impaired patients, and severe hepatic impaired patients, respectively).</p>
        <p>The AIC was lowest for the model of Bj€ ornsson and colleagues 13 (AIC¼2918), followed by the model of Tuk and colleagues 14 (AIC¼2988) and the Wiltshire recirculatory model (AIC¼3043). 12 We observed an under-prediction for arterial remimazolam concentrations at early time points (up to 3 min after dose) for the models of Tuk and colleagues 14 and Wiltshire and colleagues 12 (data not shown). Therefore, the Bj€ ornsson model was taken forward.</p>
        <p>The original model by Bj€ ornsson and colleagues had five transit compartments making up the central compartment. In our dataset we found that there was no difference in OFV and GOF when the number of transit compartments varied between 0 and 15. Hence, we removed the transit compartments (DOFV¼þ0.5, P¼0.480).</p>
        <p>Next, we added weight-based theoretic allometric scaling to all PK parameters, using a fixed exponent of 0.75 and 1 for clearance and volume terms, respectively (DOFV¼e4.30, P¼0.038). Subsequently, the statistical model was refined by the addition of a variability term describing the betweensubject variability (BSV) of the volume of the venous compartment (DOFV¼e77.4, P&lt;0.001) and two parameters describing the BSV on the volumes of the peripheral compartments (VP1: DOFV¼e85.1, P&lt;0.001; VP2: DOFV¼e23.5, P&lt;0.001). Finally, the model was simplified by removing the BSV of the volume of the arterial compartment (DOFV¼e0.004, P¼1) and by removing the additive error component in the combined proportional and additive error model (DOFV¼e0.026, P¼1) Supplementary Fig. S1.</p>
        <p>A graphical exploration of the random effects (ETAs) vs patient covariates revealed a relationship between clearance (CL), the volume of the venous compartment (VV), the volumes of the fast and slow peripheral compartment (VP1 and VP2), and the ChildePugh score (Fig. 2). We found that CL was lower in patients with severe hepatic impairment, that is Pugh score !10 (DOFV¼e11.3, P&lt;0.001), and that VP1, VP2, and VV was higher for patients with Pugh score !9 (DOFV¼e51.5, P&lt;0.001).</p>
        <p>No other covariate relationships were identified.</p>
        <p>GOF plots (Supplementary Figs S1 andS2) and a pvcVPC (Supplementary Fig. S3) showed good performance of the final model for both arterial and venous remimazolam concentrations. The 
            <rs type="software">NONMEM</rs> output for the final model is shown in Supplementary digital content 1, and parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the final model are shown in Table 2. Likelihood profiles for the fixed-effect parameters are shown in the Supplementary material.
        </p>
        <p>According to the final model, CL is 38.1% lower in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (ChildePugh score !10) compared with healthy volunteers. As a consequence, total remimazolam exposure (i.e. AUC0-inf) is 38.1% higher in these subjects. CL and AUC0-inf in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and those with end-stage renal disease are not different from those in healthy volunteers.</p>
        <p>To facilitate comparison of C max between different groups we used the model to calculate arterial and venous C max , normalised to a dose of 10 mg, for a 1 min remimazolam infusion in a 70 kg patient. End-stage renal disease had no effect on predicted C max . Predicted arterial and venous C max for healthy volunteers and patients with end-stage renal disease were 3016 and 480 ng ml À1 , respectively. Arterial C max was slightly lower for subjects with ChildePugh score !9 (2938 ng ml À1 ) and higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (ChildePugh !10; 3225 ng ml À1 ) ). The differences between arterial and venous C max values are not unexpected for a drug as remimazolam, that is a drug that is rapidly metabolised by abundant liver enzymes. A similar difference has been described by another PK/PD model for remimazolam. 18 The PK of the remimazolam metabolite, CNS7054, was not described in the population PK model. Notable differences were revealed when the concentration time profiles for CNS7054 were visually inspected (Fig. 3). Exposure and elimination were increased in renally impaired subjects. As CNS7054 is pharmacologically inactive, its prolonged half-life with renal impairment is not clinically relevant.</p>
        <p>Loss of consciousness occurred in 7/9 (77.8%) of healthy control subjects, 6/8 (75%) of subjects in the moderately hepatically impaired group, and 3/3 (100%) subjects in the severely hepatically impaired treatment group after administration of remimazolam 0.1 mg kg À1 i.v. Although there were similar durations of loss of consciousness for healthy subjects (1.6 min) and in the hepatically impaired groups (moderate 3.2 min; severe 2.0 min), the recovery to a fully awake state of consciousness was slower for subjects in the hepatically impaired groups (moderate 12.1 min; severe 16.7 min) compared with healthy control subjects (8.0 min).</p>
        <p>Potential loss of consciousness was not captured in the renal impairment trial because the dose was too low to achieve a significant degree of sedation.</p>
        <p>The safety profile of remimazolam was comparable among all groups in both trials. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 40% of subjects in the hepatic impairment trial and 52.2% in the renal impairment trial. The vast majority were of mild severity.</p>
        <p>Subjects in the hepatic impairment treatment groups reported a slightly higher incidence of TEAEs (4/8 subjects [50%] with six TEAEs in the moderate hepatic impairment group and Plasma concentrationetime profiles of total remimazolam after intravenous administration to healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic or renal impairment.

        <p>2/3 subjects [67%] with two TEAEs in the severe hepatic impairment group) compared with healthy control subjects (2/ 9 subjects [22%] with two TEAEs), although the overall incidence of AEs in this study was low. The most commonly reported events considered related to study drug were hypoxaemia (defined as saturation of peripheral oxygen &lt;90%) and injection site haematoma, and occurred in hepatic impairment groups. A total of 18 TEAEs were registered in 7/11 subjects (64%) with renal impairment, and 10 TEAEs in 5/12 subjects (42%) with normal renal function, mainly changes in blood pressure or heart rate; however, all were also considered not to be related to the study drug. There were no deaths, serious AEs, or discontinuations because of AEs reported in either study. No relevant changes were noticed regarding clinical laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG, or physical examination with remimazolam.</p>
        <p>We performed two separate trials to describe the PK and safety characteristics of the novel, ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine remimazolam in hepatically and renally impaired subjects.</p>
        <p>The remimazolam PK data were successfully modelled in a recirculatory model. This model helped to elucidate the gradual changes that occur in remimazolam distributional kinetics leading to altered PK in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (i.e. those with ChildePugh score !9) and severe hepatic impairment but not with renal impairment.</p>
        <p>The effect of hepatic impairment on remimazolam clearance was quantified with a 38.1% higher exposure in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. A simulation of plasma PK after a 10 mg remimazolam bolus revealed roughly similar arterial and venous C max values across hepatic impairment groups. Accordingly, incidence and duration of loss of consciousness were the same in both hepatically impaired and healthy subjects; however, recovery was prolonged by decreased liver function. These findings are in line with the known presence of CES-1A in the liver and confirm the liver as the main site of metabolism for remimazolam. Consistent with hepatic clearance of remimazolam, no significant differences in concentrationetime profile and PK were observed between end-stage renal disease and healthy subjects, measured after a single dose of remimazolam 1.5 mg i.v. Remimazolam showed no accumulation in renally impaired subjects, and was metabolised at the same rate as matched healthy subjects. Elimination of the inactive metabolite CNS7054 was reduced in end-stage renal disease subjects, consistent with its renal clearance. However, as CNS7054 is pharmacologically inactive, this has no clinical relevance.</p>
        <p>Our results showed that impairment of renal function to the degree of end-stage renal disease does not affect the PK of remimazolam at the dose tested, and therefore remimazolam can be used without dose adjustment in any stage of renal impairment for patients not requiring dialysis. Similarly, no dose adjustment is needed for subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Because recovery times in severely impaired subjects were prolonged, such patients may benefit from more cautious dosing during maintenance. This is in contrast to midazolam, another short-acting benzodiazepine that is known to accumulate with hepatic impairment, 19 along with its active metabolite a-hydroxy-midazolam glucuronide, which is known to accumulate with renal impairment. 20 Dose adjustments are thus recommended for subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. 21 For propofol, another short-acting anaesthetic, sensitivity to its depressant effects is reduced in patients with renal impairment and a higher induction dose might be necessary. 22 In contrast, sensitivity to the sedative and cardiorespiratory depressant effects of propofol is increased in subjects with hepatic impairment; hence the dose should be reduced. 23 There are several important limitations to be considered when interpreting these results. The number of subjects in these two trials was relatively small, particularly in the group of severely hepatic impaired subjects (n¼3). The two trials were designed independently from each other with the consequence that dosing was different. Blood sampling for PK was venous in the renal impairment trial and arterial in the hepatic trial. The PK model was specifically built to cope with the different sampling sites. The ChildePugh scale was used for categorising the degree of hepatic impairment. It is the most widely used method for this purpose, but it has several limitations; it was not developed to predict the liver's capacity to eliminate drugs, it is to some extent based on subjective assessments and it does not account for renal function. 24,25 In summary, remimazolam has predictable pharmacokinetic properties within the studied dose range, and does not require dose adjustments in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment.</p>
