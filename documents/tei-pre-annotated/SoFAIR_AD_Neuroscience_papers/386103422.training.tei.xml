        <p>Medical image segmentation has played an important role in the field of medical image analysis and attracted much attention from researchers in image processing [1]. Compared with the classical segmentation methods [2], algorithms based on Deep Learning have provided state-of-art performance and have become very popular [3]. During recent years, with the development of hardware and GPUs, several deep learning models have been proposed, such as AlexNet [4], VGG [5], 
            <rs type="software">DeepLab</rs> [6], 
            <rs type="software">GoogLeNet</rs> [7], Residual network [8] and DenseNet [9]. These network models have achieved good performance in the field of computer vision.

        <p>With respect to semantic medical image segmentation, the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) [10] provide superior performance when compared with other deep learning models. Among the various FCN architectures, the U-net [11] model is one of the most popular fully convolutional network models and it is widely used in the medical image processing field. The U-net model is a pixel-to-pixel, end-to-end fully convolutional network with skip layers between analysis path and synthesis path [11]. The U-Net needs less training resources and can reserve more important feature information. However, the standard U-Net architecture contains only a few layers and therefore it is not currently deep enough to gain 3 improved performance over other existing networks. To solve the problem, adding more layers directly to the network can enlarge the parameter space and make the network deeper, which may lead to gradient vanishing and redundant computation during training [12]. Gradient vanishing means if the network contains too many hidden layers, the learning rate will decrease with forward propagation, which may decrease the overall network learning. Therefore, the novel contribution of this paper is to make the U-Net deeper and wider without redundant computation and gradient vanishing to improve medical image segmentation.With respect to semantic medical image segmentation, the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) [10] provide superior performance when compared with other deep learning models.

        <p>In order to solve the aforementioned problems, two steps are considered: firstly, reduce redundant computation when making the network wider; secondly, avoid gradient vanishing while making the network deeper. With respect to reducing redundant computation, existing research indicates that sparse matrices can be clustered into dense sub-matrices to improve calculation and performance [13]. Network models like AlexNet or VGG demonstrate good experimental performance but they are computationally expensive. Compared with the models above, the GoogLeNet architecture proposed the concept of an "Inception module" to build a sparse, high performance computing network architecture [7]. The main advantage of this module is improving the utilization rate of computing resources by increasing the depth and width of network with the inception module while keeping the computational budget constant [14].In order to solve the aforementioned problems, two steps are considered: firstly, reduce redundant computation when making the network wider; secondly, avoid gradient vanishing while making the network deeper.

        <p>In the second step, recent research shows that the neural network does not have to be a progressive architecture and remains converging even though some layers are dropped randomly [15]. Inspired by this idea, a deep network model called DenseNet was proposed as a kind of convolutional neural network with dense connections. The DenseNet architecture has various advantages: parameter simplicity, vanishing-gradient reducing and feature reuse [16]. These characteristics make the networks a very good fit for semantic segmentation as they naturally induce skip connections and multi-scale supervision.In the second step, recent research shows that the neural network does not have to be a progressive architecture and remains converging even though some layers are dropped randomly [15].

        <p>A modified residual inception module is proposed to be used in both the analysis path and the synthesis path. The main purpose is to aggregate feature maps from different branches of kernels of different sizes, which can make the network wider and capable of learning more features [21]. Moreover, the residual connections make the learning easier since a residual inception block learns a function with reference to the input feature maps, instead of learning an unreferenced function [22]. Fig. 2 shows the proposed modified Inception-Res block. Different from the original Inception-Res architecture, each convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization (BN) layer except for bottleneck layers. Batch normalization layer can avoid gradient vanishing while retaining convolutional layers. size convolution kernel represents the bottleneck layer [23]. Thus, the output of the module from 1 × 1 the analysis path is as follows:A modified residual inception module is proposed to be used in both the analysis path and the synthesis path.

        <p>In the Dense-Inception block, the inception module proposed above is inserted into the dense connection block. By setting the padding as "Same" mode in the convolutional layer, the outputs of the inception module will remain the same size of feature map as the inputs. Thus, the inception module can be regarded as a much wider convolutional layer since it is an aggregate of different kernel sizes with pooling layers [22]. The main purpose is to fit the inception module into the dense connection architecture and therefore make the network simultaneously deeper and wider without gradient vanishing or redundant computation. The inception module with residual connection in the dense connection block is different from the standard residual inception module as the batch normalization layer is also used after each convolutional layer. The dense connection's main purpose is to make the network deeper by concatenating former convolution outputs but narrower with the small hyper-parameter of growth rate. Therefore, in order to fit the residual inception module in the dense connection block, the dense connection module is modified to improve the performance in the dense connection block. In this way, the Dense-Inception blocks are set in the middle of the network model, where the size of the feature map is small, and a large kernel can be replaced by two smaller kernels to reduce computational cost [24].

        <p>The datasets contain three different segmentation tasks, including lung segmentation in CT datasets, blood vessel segmentation and MRI brain tumor segmentation task. The lung segmentation dataset is from the "Finding and Measuring Lungs in CT Data" competition in the Kaggle Data Science Bowl in 2017. It is a collection of CT images, manually segmented lung and measurements in 2/3D. In the experiments only 2D images will be used and measured. The blood vessel segmentation task contains three different datasets including the DRIVE [26], 
            <rs type="software">STARE</rs> [27] and CHASH_DB1 [28]. In order to enhance the generality of model, these three datasets are randomly merged to create a new dataset which will be used in the proposed model. The MRI brain tumor segmentation dataset was acquired on a 3T scanner at the UMC Utrecht and contain 88 subjects including patients with diabetes, dementia, Alzheimer and matched controls [20]. To fit the dataset into the network each subject was sliced into 2D images based on axial direction. Example image data from these three datasets are shown in Fig. 6. In this figure, the first row is from lungs dataset, the last row is from brain dataset, and the remaining rows are from the retina dataset. The left column shows the original images, the right column shows the ground truth.

            <rs type="software">ResU-</rs>Net's results; And in terms of Jaccard similarity, AC, SE, SP, F1-score and AUC coefficient, the results from 
            <rs type="software">DIU-Net</rs> are all higher than second segmentation performance as follows: 0.9824%, 0.24%, 1.87%, 0.01%, 0.60% and 0.84%.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, with the help of dense connections and inception layers, DIU-Net can be deeper and more effective than the original networks. In order to make the experiment more convincing, the experiments of SegNet, FCN-8s, U-Net and ResU-Net used the same initial method, optimization algorithm, loss function and other initial parameters with 
            <rs type="software">DIU-Net</rs>. The 
            <rs type="software">DIU-</rs>Net with three Dense-Inception modules has better segmentation performance than with just one Dense-Inception block. The results show that the module can effectively deepen the depth of the network without introducing gradient disappearance, so that the network can learn more image features.

        <p>The original images to be used for blood vessel segmentation are RGB images, and they can provide the clearest features of blood vessel under the green channel. Thus, preprocessing via normalization is necessary before conducting the segmentation experiment. The whole dataset contains only 136 samples of RGB images including labels. Among the samples, 85% of the data will be used for training and validating, and the remaining 15% data will be used for testing. In order to get a reliable and stable model, In terms of quantitative analysis, Table 3 shows the detail of the evaluation results. As the blood vessel data contains three different kinds of datasets including the DRIVE, STARE and CHASH_DB1, the results of traditional methods are calculated by averaging. From Table 3 it can be concluded that the DIU-Net model shows better performance in terms of the DICE coefficient, Jaccard similarity, accuracy, F1-score and the sensitivity. In particular, the DICE coefficient is 0.15% higher than the results of ResU-Net. In terms of Jaccard similarity, AC, SE, SP, F1-score and AUC coefficient, the results from DIU-Net are all higher than second segmentation performance as follows: 0.31%, 0.15%, 2.84%, 0.09%, 2.11% and 0.60%. Compared with the traditional methods [33,35], the DIU-Net also achieves better performance. Therefore, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for medical image segmentation tasks. In particular, the blood vessel segmentation task is more complicated than the lung segmentation task, and the 
            <rs type="software">DIU-</rs>Net with deeper architecture performs better in this task than other networks. The Dense-Inception blocks make the network much deeper and wider in order to gain increased performance.

        <p>The provided MRI scans brain tumor segmentation dataset consists of 88 subjects, and each subject was sliced into 2D images based on axial direction. After deleting the data without label pixels there are 4937 images and the same number of labels in total. In this experiment, 90% of the data will be used for training and validating, and the remaining data will be used for testing. In order to get a reliable and stable model, 5-fold cross-validation will be used in this experiment. The first column shows the original image, the second column shows the ground truth, and the remaining columns show the outputs as follows: SegNet, FCN-8s, U-Net, ResU-Net, DIU-Net-1 and DIU-Net.

        <p>The limitation of the proposed DIU-Net model is that in the Dense-Inception block increasing the growth rate may lead to too many parameters, making the model more difficult and slower to train. Another issue is that the test datasets did not include ultrasound images, which contain more speckle noise. Therefore, in the future we will aim to simplify the network structure whilst maintaining its accuracy and effectiveness. And we will also test the proposed model on ultrasound datasets and modify it to make the model more effective on various kinds of medical problems.The limitation of the proposed DIU-Net model is that in the Dense-Inception block increasing the growth rate may lead to too many parameters, making the model more difficult and slower to train.
