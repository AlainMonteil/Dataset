        <p>Background Global and regional prevalence estimates for blindness and vision impairment are important for the development of public health policies. We aimed to provide global estimates, trends, and projections of global blindness and vision impairment.Background Global and regional prevalence estimates for blindness and vision impairment are important for the development of public health policies. We aimed to provide global estimates, trends, and projections of global blindness and vision impairment.</p>
        <p>We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based datasets relevant to global vision impairment and blindness that were published between 1980 and 2015. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate the prevalence (by age, country, and sex), in 2015, of mild visual impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 to 6/18 inclusive), moderate to severe visual impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive), blindness (presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60), and functional presbyopia (defined as presenting near vision worse than N6 or N8 at 40 cm when best-corrected distance visual acuity was better than 6/12).We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based datasets relevant to global vision impairment and blindness that were published between 1980 and 2015.

        <p>Globally, of the 7•33 billion people alive in 2015, an estimated 36•0 million (80% uncertainty interval [UI] 12•9-65•4) were blind (crude prevalence 0•48%; 80% UI 0•17-0•87; 56% female), 216•6 million (80% UI 98•5-359•1) people had moderate to severe visual impairment (2•95%, 80% UI 1•34-4•89; 55% female), and 188•5 million (80% UI 64•5-350•2) had mild visual impairment (2•57%, 80% UI 0•88-4•77; 54% female). Functional presbyopia affected an estimated 1094•7 million (80% UI 581•1-1686•5) people aged 35 years and older, with 666•7 million (80% UI 364•9-997•6) being aged 50 years or older. The estimated number of blind people increased by 17•6%, from 30•6 million (80% UI 9•9-57•3) in 1990 to 36•0 million (80% UI 12•9-65•4) in 2015. This change was attributable to three factors, namely an increase because of population growth (38•4%), population ageing after accounting for population growth (34•6%), and reduction in age-specific prevalence (-36•7%). The number of people with moderate and severe visual impairment also increased, from 159•9 million (80% UI 68•3-270•0) in 1990 to 216•6 million (80% UI 98•5-359•1) in 2015.Globally, of the 7•33 billion people alive in 2015, an estimated 36•0 million (80% uncertainty interval [UI] 12•9-65•4) were blind (crude prevalence 0•48%; 80% UI 0•17-0•87; 56% female), 216•6 million (80% UI 98•5-359•1) people had moderate to severe visual impairment (2•95%, 80% UI 1•34-4•89; 55% female), and 188•5 million (80% UI 64•5-350•2) had mild visual impairment (2•57%, 80% UI 0•88-4•77; 54% female).

        <p>Interpretation There is an ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and visual impairment, yet the growth and ageing of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in number of people affected. These observations, plus a very large contribution from uncorrected presbyopia, highlight the need to scale up vision impairment alleviation efforts at all levels.Interpretation There is an ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and visual impairment, yet the growth and ageing of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in number of people affected.

        <p>Universal Eye Health: a Global Action Plan 2014-2019 was adopted by WHO member states at the World Health Assembly in 2013. 1 Its goals are to reduce vision impairment as a global public health problem and to secure access to rehabilitation for people with vision impairment. The initiative has the global target of reducing the prevalence of avoidable vision impairment by 25% from 2010 to 2019. One of the key objectives of the Global Action Plan is to generate evidence on the magnitude of vision impairment, which is required to evaluate the success of this and similar initiatives.Universal Eye Health: a Global Action Plan 2014-2019 was adopted by WHO member states at the World Health Assembly in 2013. 1 Its goals are to reduce vision impairment as a global public health problem and to secure access to rehabilitation for people with vision impairment.

        <p>Previously, we reported the results of a systematic review of published literature and some unpublished data from population-based studies that reported the prevalence of blindness and vision impairment from 1980, using a continuously updated database of population-based studies (the Global Vision Database). Globally, we estimated that 32•4 million people were blind in 2010, and that 191 million people had moderate and severe vision impairment. Additionally, the agestandardised prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment decreased between 1990 and 2010. 2 Country-specific data were made available online, searchable by level of vision impairment, age, and sex.Previously, we reported the results of a systematic review of published literature and some unpublished data from population-based studies that reported the prevalence of blindness and vision impairment from 1980, using a continuously updated database of population-based studies (the Global Vision Database).

        <p>Vision impairment and age-related eye diseases affect economic and educational opportunities, 3 reduce quality of life, 4 and increase the risk of death. 5,6 Previously, we reported principally on blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment, with minimal detail beyond a global estimate for mild vision impairment because data were sparse for this vision impairment category, in which a person has a presenting (with usual optical correction) visual acuity less than 6/12 but 6/18 or better in the better eye. 7 This degree of vision impairment, despite being classified as mild, has a substantial effect on quality of life. For example, in many countries, an individual with this level of vision would be barred from driving. 8 Uncorrected presbyopia is the most common cause of vision impairment, 9 hence WHO has recommended measurement of near vision in population-based surveys (eg, the Consultation on development of standards for characterization of vision loss and visual functioning in 2003). In some contexts, impairment of near vision is at least as detrimental to quality of life as impairment of distance vision, regardless of the environment, lifestyle, or sociodemographic status of the affected individuals. 10 Improvements to the Global Vision Database that broadened its capabilities enabled us to provide global estimates of the 2015 global burden of vision impairment, including functional presbyopia; to report trends in vision impairment from 1990 to 2015 by country, sex, and age; and to make projections to 2020 and 2050 regarding the number of people with vision impairment.Vision impairment and age-related eye diseases affect economic and educational opportunities, 3 reduce quality of life, 4 and increase the risk of death. 5,6 Previously, we reported principally on blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment, with minimal detail beyond a global estimate for mild vision impairment because data were sparse for this vision impairment category, in which a person has a presenting (with usual optical correction) visual acuity less than 6/12 but 6/18 or better in the better eye. 7 This degree of vision impairment, despite being classified as mild, has a substantial effect on quality of life.

        <p>Using data from the Global Vision Database, we estimated trends in prevalence of vision impairment and their uncertainties, by sex, for 188 countries in the 21 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, from 1990 to 2015 (appendix 1). Using definitions and an analytical framework similar to that of our previous publication 2 (appendix 1), we used statistical models to estimate the prevalence of two of the core categories of vision impairment: blindness (presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60) and a combined grouping called moderate and severe vision impairment (presenting visual acuity worse than 6/18 to 3/60 inclusive; table 1). 2 We did our analysis in seven steps: data identification and extraction; conversion of vision impairment data to two core levels (blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment); estimation of age-specific vision impairment prevalence when data were not reported by age; selection and use of a statistical model to estimate the prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment by country, age, sex, and year; estimation of severe, moderate, and mild vision impairment based on crosswalk from our estimates of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment; estimation of functional presbyopia prevalence; and forecasting of prevalence of blindness and vision impairment to 2020 and 2050.Using data from the Global Vision Database, we estimated trends in prevalence of vision impairment and their uncertainties, by sex, for 188 countries in the 21 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, from 1990 to 2015 (appendix 1).

        <p>Evidence before this study The first systematic review of published literature (1980-2012) involved extraction of data on both presenting and best-corrected visual acuity from only population-based studies that reported prevalence of vision impairment and a definition of vision impairment for which we could develop a method for inclusion. These data formed the Global Vision Database from which estimates for global prevalence of vision impairment and blindness were calculated for 2010. This was the most comprehensive global meta-analysis of its kind, with important advances on previous WHO reports that had not investigated sex differences or age distributions in blindness and vision impairment. The study also permitted, for the first time, a temporal analysis from 1990 to 2010 that showed a decline in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and vision impairment, but an increase in crude prevalence (due to population growth and ageing).Evidence before this study The first systematic review of published literature (1980-2012) involved extraction of data on both presenting and best-corrected visual acuity from only population-based studies that reported prevalence of vision impairment and a definition of vision impairment for which we could develop a method for inclusion.

        <p>This study updates the global, regional, and country-level blindness and vision impairment prevalence estimates to 2015, incorporating important developments since 2010, namely more data sources (61 new studies from 35 different countries) including more precise data (individual-level data for many studies), improved statistical analysis, the inclusion of estimates of functional presbyopia, and projections of blindness and vision impairment burden to 2020 and 2050.This study updates the global, regional, and country-level blindness and vision impairment prevalence estimates to 2015, incorporating important developments since 2010, namely more data sources (61 new studies from 35 different countries) including more precise data (individual-level data for many studies), improved statistical analysis, the inclusion of estimates of functional presbyopia, and projections of blindness and vision impairment burden to 2020 and 2050.</p>
        <p>Our study has shown that in 2015, an estimated 36 million people were blind, 217 million were moderately or severely vision impaired, and 188 million had mild vision impairment. 1•09 billion people aged 35 years or older are affected by near-vision impairment due to uncorrected presbyopia. The interval improvement (in terms of a reduction in prevalence of distance vision impairment) since 1990 and 2010, after accounting for population growth and ageing, suggests that investments made in the alleviation of vision impairment during this period have reaped considerable dividends. Such dividends would include improvements in quality of life, and large economic benefits as people work rather than living with unnecessary disability. Yet the growth and change in age structure of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in the number of people with blindness and vision impairment, which appears to be accelerating. This finding highlights the need to scale up our current efforts at global, regional, and country level.Our study has shown that in 2015, an estimated 36 million people were blind, 217 million were moderately or severely vision impaired, and 188 million had mild vision impairment. 1•09 billion people aged 35 years or older are affected by near-vision impairment due to uncorrected presbyopia.

        <p>Briefly, studies that were included in the Global Vision Database met the following requirement criteria. Reported prevalence of blindness, visual impairment, or both, was measured from random sample cross-sectional surveys of representative populations of any age of a country or area of a country. Studies using hospital or clinic case series, blindness registries, and interview studies with selfreported vision status were not included. Definitions of visual impairment or blindness were clearly stated, used thresholds of visual acuity in the better eye that matched or could be later modelled to match the definitions given in appendix 1. Best-corrected or presenting visual acuity was stated. Procedures used for measurement of visual acuity were clearly stated. We extracted data on both presenting and best-corrected visual acuity. Appendix 1 includes a full list of data sources for distance blindness, vision impairment, and presbyopia.Briefly, studies that were included in the Global Vision Database met the following requirement criteria.

        <p>Similar to the strategy in our previous systematic review, 2 we standardised all prevalence data to the definitions of vision impairment selected for this study (appendix 1). We used four regressions to convert two commonly used definitions of blindness (visual acuity &lt;6/60 and visual acuity ≤6/60) to our definition of blindness, and to convert two commonly reported definitions of vision impairment (visual acuity &lt;6/18 and visual acuity &lt;6/12) to our definition of moderate and severe vision impairment (appendix 1).Similar to the strategy in our previous systematic review, 2 we standardised all prevalence data to the definitions of vision impairment selected for this study (appendix 1).

        <p>Our statistical model is based on the age-specific prevalence of vision impairment for 5-year age intervals (eg, 20-24-yearolds). In cases when studies reported the prevalence of vision impairment for a wider age group-such as all ages or adults older than 50 years-we converted these to 5-year age groups as follows. We fitted two universal age patterns, one for the prevalence of blindness and one for the prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment, meta-analysing from aggregated studies that reported prevalence for the narrower age groups. We then applied the fitted age patterns to the wide age group aggregated dataset, to calculate prevalence by 5-year age intervals. We ensured that the age-specific prevalence values summed to the reported wide age range prevalence when weighted by the country's population by age.

        <p>We fitted two hierarchical Bayesian logistic regressions to estimate vision impairment prevalence over time, by age group, sex, and country, with one model for the prevalence of blindness and one model for the prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment. Using fully Bayesian statistical inference, 11 our posterior estimates of vision impairment were able to flexibly borrow strength such that country-specific estimates were informed by study data from the same country, where available, and by study data from other countries in the same region or the same year. Variance parameters for the random and fixed effects in the model, which were themselves assigned prior values, enabled the model to flexibly learn the degree to which data were pooled between countries in the same region and over time.We fitted two hierarchical Bayesian logistic regressions to estimate vision impairment prevalence over time, by age group, sex, and country, with one model for the prevalence of blindness and one model for the prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment.

        <p>We used a model in which vision impairment levels in countries were modelled hierarchically to be nested into each of the 21 GBD regions, which were in turn nested in the seven GBD world super-regions (appendix 1). We modelled hierarchical linear trends over time, allowing for region-specific trends in prevalence of vision impairment in the seven world super-regions. A sex effect was likewise modelled hierarchically by seven world super-regions, thus allowing for differences in sex disparities by region. We modelled age as a three-piece linear spline with knots at age 40 years and age 70 years.We used a model in which vision impairment levels in countries were modelled hierarchically to be nested into each of the 21 GBD regions, which were in turn nested in the seven GBD world super-regions (appendix 1).

        <p>To account for potential variability resulting from nonhomogeneous study designs and from some studies being only subnationally or locally representative, we included study-specific error terms, which we interacted with an indicator of whether the study was national or not. This approach permitted nationally representative studies to have a greater influence on estimates. We also included a fixed effect indicator for urban versus rural studies. We included a fixed effect indicator for whether the study measured prevalence on the basis of bestcorrected or presenting distance visual acuity, and we allowed this difference to vary in the south Asia region, for reasons we have previously described.To account for potential variability resulting from nonhomogeneous study designs and from some studies being only subnationally or locally representative, we included study-specific error terms, which we interacted with an indicator of whether the study was national or not.

        <p>To help with issues of data sparsity, we included two time-varying covariates: mean years of adult education by age group 12 and an index of access to health care. 13 Our model was developed on the basis of previous work and on the leave-one-out measure of model fit similar to cross-validation. 14,15 We fitted our blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment models using Bayesian inference, sampling from the posterior distribution over the parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, as implemented in the

        <p>We fitted logistic regressions to convert the prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment to mild, moderate, and severe vision impairment (appendix 1), and applied the logistic regressions to each sampled prediction drawn from the Bayesian posterior, thus obtaining a set of samples of mild, moderate, and severe vision impairment by country-year-age-sex group. To obtain global and regional estimates, we calculated the means and the tenth and 90th percentiles of the posterior uncertainty intervals for each country prediction, age, and sex, then we combined these, weighting each country prediction by its population in the relevant age-sex category. We also reported age-standardised estimates using the WHO reference population, 17 and the raw numbers of people with vision impairment by category. We calculated trends of age-standardised vision impairment by world region, with UIs, by calculating the difference between the 1990 and 2015 age-standardised prevalence. The statistical code is available on request from the corresponding author. We investigated the attribution of change in age-standardised vision impairment to three factors, namely percentage change because of population growth, population ageing after accounting for population growth, and change in age-specific prevalence.We fitted logistic regressions to convert the prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment to mild, moderate, and severe vision impairment (appendix 1), and applied the logistic regressions to each sampled prediction drawn from the Bayesian posterior, thus obtaining a set of samples of mild, moderate, and severe vision impairment by country-year-age-sex group.

        <p>To estimate the prevalence of near vision impairment due to uncorrected presbyopia (functional presbyopia), we included studies in which presbyopia was defined as presenting near vision worse than N6 or N8 at 40 cm, regardless of distance refractive status. For broad estimates of vision impairment, including both distance and near presenting impairment, we only included data from people whose best-corrected visual acuity was 6/12 (20/40) or better, to avoid double counting those with both distance and near vision impairment associated with non-refractive causes. For most of the studies, the prevalence of functional presbyopia was reported, as well as data regarding near spectacle correction, the latter of which we excluded. For other studies in which this approach was not possible, we used presenting near vision data if reported. For a multisite study that reported presenting visual acuity for which we had access to microdata, 18,19 we included all participants with presenting visual acuity worse than 6/12 at near vision and subtracted the number of people with best-corrected visual acuity worse than 6/12. All included studies only included participants older than 35 years.To estimate the prevalence of near vision impairment due to uncorrected presbyopia (functional presbyopia), we included studies in which presbyopia was defined as presenting near vision worse than N6 or N8 at 40 cm, regardless of distance refractive status. For broad estimates of vision impairment, including both distance and near presenting impairment, we only included data from people whose best-corrected visual acuity was 6/12 (20/40) or better, to avoid double counting those with both distance and near vision impairment associated with non-refractive causes. For most of the studies, the prevalence of functional presbyopia was reported, as well as data regarding near spectacle correction, the latter of which we excluded. For other studies in which this approach was not possible, we used presenting near vision data if reported.

        <p>We developed a similar model to the main model used for blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment. We used a hierarchical generalised linear modelling framework with a negative binomial observation model and logistic link function. Because of data sparsity, we did not include country-level covariates or indicators. The model included an intercept term and random offsets for ten age categories, 21 GBD regions, seven world superregions, and each study, in which each set of random offsets was assigned a common Bayesian prior to enable partial pooling. 20 The age categories were given by 5-year age bands, with an indicator variable for each age group starting with 35-39 years, and then continuing by 5-year age bands until a final age band of older than 80 years. Observations that covered wider age bands were incorporated by population-weighted averaging. For example, for a study reporting prevalence for ages 35-44 years, the model's predicted estimates for 35-39 years and 40-44 years were averaged on the basis of the appropriate country-year population distribution, and this average was then linked to the observed prevalence.We developed a similar model to the main model used for blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment.

        <p>We applied our model to forecast prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment. These forecasts projected possible scenarios rather than as fully probabilistic forecasts, so we have not reported UIs. Our model relies on health status and education as covariates. Since it is impossible to predict how these will evolve decades into the future, we extrapolated these covariates to the year 2020 (appendix 1) and then held them constant to 2050. Since our model gives estimates of crude prevalence for country-years, we relied on the UN Population Division's forecasts to 2050 to derive crude numbers affected and age-standardised prevalence. 21 Thus, our estimates are also contingent on the assumptions regarding future fertility and mortality that underpin the UN Population Division's estimates.We applied our model to forecast prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment.

        <p>In 2015, the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and moderate and severe vision impairment and mild vision impairment among older adults was far higher in some developing regions than in high-income regions (figure 2; appendix 1).

        <p>The interval improvement (in terms of a reduction in age-standardised prevalence of distance vision impairment) since 1990 and since 2010, after accounting for population growth and ageing, suggests that modest investments that were made in the alleviation of impairment during this period have reaped considerable dividends. Such dividends include improvements in quality of life and large economic benefits, because people work rather than living with or caring for those living with unnecessary vision impairment. 22,23 Although this study does not directly assess the causes of vision impairment, the large disparities between regionsas well as results from previous reports that directly addressed the question 24 -suggest that most cases of vision impairment in lesser-developed countries could be prevented or reversed. Although additional alleviation efforts will be needed everywhere, the regions with the largest prevalence and absolute burden of vision impairment should receive targeted attention. Given that a large proportion of blindness or vision impairment will require individual-level care by trained practitioners, areas such as those in sub-Saharan Africa with high agestandardised prevalence of vision impairment and younger population age structures represent particularly important places in which to scale up training, in preparation for the predicted demographic expansion in older age groups.The interval improvement (in terms of a reduction in age-standardised prevalence of distance vision impairment) since 1990 and since 2010, after accounting for population growth and ageing, suggests that modest investments that were made in the alleviation of impairment during this period have reaped considerable dividends.

        <p>The growth and change in age structure of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in the number of people with blindness and vision impairment, which appears to be accelerating. Concurrently, the observed decline in crude prevalence appears to be becoming less marked, particularly with regard to severe, moderate, and mild vision impairment. Although there are limitations to the modelling projections, the projected increase in prevalence and the global numbers affected by blindness and vision impairment, for example the numbers of blind people increasing to 38•5 million by 2020 and 115 million by 2050, indicates the scale of the challenge. The observed reductions in age-standardised prevalence of visual impairment in areas that received modest investments in blindness alleviation suggest that further investment is likely to mitigate these trends.The growth and change in age structure of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in the number of people with blindness and vision impairment, which appears to be accelerating.

        <p>The finding that women bear the majority of blindness and vision impairment in population-based studies has been widely reported. A review of inequity in vision loss 25 concluded that insufficient data for analysis of inequality remains a problem in eye care and highlights the need for equity-relevant goals, targets, and indicators for eye healthcare programmes. There are many other reasons for health inequality between population groups, between and within countries, which could include unfair distribution of power and resources and global governance dysfunction, these factors being judged as root causes in recent reports by the Commissions on Social Determinants of Health and the recent Global Governance for Health. 26,27 Doubtless, some of these root causes would be responsible for the considerable variation in crude and age-standardised prevalence of blindness and vision impairment that we observed between countries, and the very high prevalence of older adult blindness in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.The finding that women bear the majority of blindness and vision impairment in population-based studies has been widely reported.

        <p>Since 2010, we have added 61 new studies reporting distance vision impairment to the Global Vision Database, the dataset that underpins these analyses. Several principal investigators have contributed more disaggregated data than was available in their previous publications, which have been added to the Global Vision Database. Additionally, the expansion of Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness population-based eye surveys and the recently created online repository for these data have been a valuable contribution and resource for the Global Vision Database. Most studies that were newly added originated from east Asia, south Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, and east sub-Saharan Africa, whereas only a few new studies came from high-income North America, Latin America, Europe, and Australasia. In view of all available data, gaps are still present for central and southern Sub-Saharan Africa, eastern and central Europe, central Asia, and the Caribbean (figure 1).Since 2010, we have added 61 new studies reporting distance vision impairment to the Global Vision Database, the dataset that underpins these analyses.

        <p>Limitations of our study have to be taken into account. First, the availability of data sources varied between the For more on the RAAB online repository see http://www.raabdata.info world regions, with major gaps as described previously. Second, the studies underlying our meta-analysis have varied definitions of blindness and vision impairment. Although we statistically corrected for differences between the studies, this difference increased the uncertainty of the estimates. We appeal for a worldwide reporting standardisation of definitions of blindness and vision impairment. 28 For instance, under-corrected presbyopia, until recently, has mostly been neglected, even in major population-based studies in ophthalmology, with the result that precision of estimates is weaker. Specifically, in terms of studies involving uncorrected presbyopia, there are limitations that involve differences between studies in which some measure objective and others functional presbyopia, with differences in test distance and font size. Fourth, many studies were not done on a national level. Although we took into account the level of representativeness of the data in the statistical model, for many countries only regionally assessed data on blindness and vision impairment were available. Although the so-called national level is arbitrary, it is a natural level for ascertainment of vision impairment burden since policy is typically made at a national level. Fifth, most underlying population-based studies included only participants who could access the examination centre whereas institutionalised (often elderly) individuals usually did not fully participate in the studies. This dynamic could have biased blindness and vision impairment estimates downward, since many eye diseases are age-related. 29,30 Sixth, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of the forecast of blindness and vision impairment. For example, it is assumed that the UN population projections for the future 21 are correct and that the covariates that we used in our model for access to health care 13 and literacy, 12 which have not been modelled into the future, will remain unchanged after 2015. Clearly, the level of provision of services will not remain the same, especially in areas such as cataract surgery and spectacles correction, but it is difficult to forecast what these changes will be.Limitations of our study have to be taken into account. First, the availability of data sources varied between the For more on the RAAB online repository see http://www.raabdata.info world regions, with major gaps as described previously. Second, the studies underlying our meta-analysis have varied definitions of blindness and vision impairment. Although we statistically corrected for differences between the studies, this difference increased the uncertainty of the estimates. We appeal for a worldwide reporting standardisation of definitions of blindness and vision impairment. 28 For instance, under-corrected presbyopia, until recently, has mostly been neglected, even in major population-based studies in ophthalmology, with the result that precision of estimates is weaker. Specifically, in terms of studies involving uncorrected presbyopia, there are limitations that involve differences between studies in which some measure objective and others functional presbyopia, with differences in test distance and font size. Fourth, many studies were not done on a national level. Although we took into account the level of representativeness of the data in the statistical model, for many countries only regionally assessed data on blindness and vision impairment were available. Although the so-called national level is arbitrary, it is a natural level for ascertainment of vision impairment burden since policy is typically made at a national level. Fifth, most underlying population-based studies included only participants who could access the examination centre whereas institutionalised (often elderly) individuals usually did not fully participate in the studies. This dynamic could have biased blindness and vision impairment estimates downward, since many eye diseases are age-related. 29,30 Sixth, caution must be exercised in the interpretation of the forecast of blindness and vision impairment.

        <p>By contrast with the previous modelling approach we took for 2010 estimates, 2 we have taken a fully Bayesian inference approach to modelling and posterior inference in this analysis. We used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit our model, thus obtaining full posterior distributions for all parameters and quantities of interest (eg, age-standardised prevalence in a given country-year and change in prevalence from 1990 to 2015). We summarised these distributions by reporting 80% posterior uncertainty intervals surrounding the mean, rather than bootstrapped confidence intervals, as previously reported. 2 In the Bayesian framework, these uncertainty intervals reflect our probabilistic belief (posterior credibility) in our posterior mean predictions. Our models also changed slightly from the previous publication because we followed the 2015 GBD's slightly revised regional groupings.By contrast with the previous modelling approach we took for 2010 estimates, 2 we have taken a fully Bayesian inference approach to modelling and posterior inference in this analysis.

        <p>Vision interventions provide some of the largest returns on investment 31 and are some of the most feasibly implemented interventions in less developed areas because of limited needs for infrastructure, lower costs, and relatively high potential for cost recovery in certain subdomains (eg, cataract surgery), compared with other health interventions. Although this report substantiates the ongoing reduction in the age-standardised prevalence of blindness and vision impairment noted in 2010, the growth and ageing of the world's population is causing a substantial increase in the number of people with blindness and vision impairment, which appears to be accelerating. These observations highlight the need to respond to WHO's Global Action Plan by scale-up of our current efforts at global, regional, and country levels, to eliminate the burden of unnecessary blindness and vision impairment.Vision interventions provide some of the largest returns on investment 31 and are some of the most feasibly implemented interventions in less developed areas because of limited needs for infrastructure, lower costs, and relatively high potential for cost recovery in certain subdomains (eg, cataract surgery), compared with other health interventions.
