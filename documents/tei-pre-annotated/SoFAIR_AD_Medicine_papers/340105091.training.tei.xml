        <p>COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Large age and gender differences in case severity and mortality have been observed in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 1 ; however, these differences are currently unexplained. SARS-CoV-2 enters epithelial cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor 2 . Some evidence suggests that gene expression and subsequent receptor levels are elevated in the airway and oral epithelium of current smokers 3,4 , thus putting smokers at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Other studies, however, suggest that nicotine downregulates the ACE-2 receptor 5 . These uncertainties notwithstanding, both former and current smoking is known to increase the risk of respiratory viral 6,7 and bacterial 8,9 infections and is associated with worse outcomes once infected. Cigarette smoke reduces the respiratory immune defence through peri-bronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis, impaired mucociliary clearance and disruption of the respiratory epithelium 10 . There is also reason to believe that behavioural factors (e.g. regular hand-to-mouth movements) involved in smoking may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in current smokers. However, early data from the COVID-19 pandemic have not provided clear evidence for a negative impact of current or former smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease outcomes, such as hospitalisation or mortality 11 . It has also been hypothesised that nicotine might protect against a hyper-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may lead to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 disease 12 .COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

        <p>There are several reviews that fall within the scope of smoking and COVID-19 11,[13][14][15][16][17][18] . We aimed to produce a rapid synthesis of available evidence pertaining to the rates of infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 stratified by smoking status. Given the increasing availability of data on this topic, this is a living review with regular updates. As evidence accumulates, the review will be expanded to include studies reporting COVID-19 outcomes by alternative nicotine use (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes).There are several reviews that fall within the scope of smoking and COVID-19 11,[13][14][15][16][17][18] .

        <p>A narrative synthesis was conducted. Data from 'good' and 'fair' quality studies were pooled in R v.3.6.3 22 . In a living review where new data are regularly added to the analyses, it may be more appropriate to use a Bayesian (as opposed to frequentist) approach where prior knowledge is used in combination with new data to estimate a posterior risk distribution. A Bayesian approach mitigates against the issue of performing multiple statistical tests, which can inflate family-wise error. A series of random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses were performed with the 
            <rs type="software">brms</rs> 23 package to estimate the relative risk for each comparison with accompanying 95% credible intervals (CrIs). We first defined prior distributions for the true pooled effect size (µ) and the between-study heterogeneity (τ), with µ specified as a normal distribution with a mean equal to the derived point estimate from each comparison of interest in the immediately preceding version of this living review 24 , and τ specified as a half-Cauchy distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The half-Cauchy distribution was selected to reflect prior knowledge that high levels of between-study heterogeneity are more likely than lower levels. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (20,000 burn-ins followed by 80,000 iterations) were then used to generate a risk distribution for each study, in addition to a pooled effect for the posterior risk distribution. We report forest plots with the pooled effect for the posterior risk distribution displayed as the median relative risk with an accompanying 95% CrIs. We used the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) to estimate the probability of there being a 10% reduction or 10% increase in relative risk (RR) (i.e. RR . or RR . ). Due to a lack of indication as to what constitutes a clinically or epidemiologically meaningful effect (e.g. with regards to onward disease transmission or requirements for intensive care beds), we deemed a 10% change in risk as small but important.
        </p>
        <p>Where data were inconclusive (as indicated by CrIs crossing RR = 1.0), to disambiguate whether data favoured no effect or there being a small but important association, we estimated whether there was probability of RR . or RR . . Two sensitivity analyses were performed. First, a minimally informative prior for µ was specified as a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 and τ as described above. Second, an informative prior as described above for µ was used with τ specified as a half-Cauchy distribution with a mean of 0.3 and standard deviation of 1 to reflect greater between-study heterogeneity.Where data were inconclusive (as indicated by CrIs crossing RR = 1.0), to disambiguate whether data favoured no effect or there being a small but important association, we estimated whether there was probability of RR . or RR . .

        <p>1) Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous with different subgroups at heightened risk of infection at different stages of the pandemic. This will likely introduce bias in studies assessing the rate of infection by smoking status conducted early on.1) Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous with different subgroups at heightened risk of infection at different stages of the pandemic. This will likely introduce bias in studies assessing the rate of infection by smoking status conducted early on.</p>
        <p>2) Current and former smokers may be more likely to meet local criteria for community testing due to increased prevalence of symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cough, increased sputum production or altered sense of smell or taste 35 . Evidence from a small number of studies indicates that current smokers may be more likely to present for testing, hence increasing the denominator in comparisons with never smokers and potentially inflating the rate of negative tests in current smokers. Infection positivity rates estimated among random samples will be more informative than currently available data. We identified one population study conducted in Hungary reporting on seroprevalence and smoking status 36 ; however, the response rate was fairly low at 58.8% and the current smoking rate was 10 percentage points below national prevalence estimates, thus questioning the representativeness of the final sample. Smoking status is being collected in at least two large representative infection and antibody surveys in the UK 37,38 .2) Current and former smokers may be more likely to meet local criteria for community testing due to increased prevalence of symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cough, increased sputum production or altered sense of smell or taste 35 .

        <p>3) Testing for acute infection requires swabbing of the mucosal epithelium, which may be disrupted in current smokers, potentially altering the sensitivity of assays 39 . 7) Smokers with COVID-19 may be less likely to receive a SARS-CoV-2 test or present to hospital due to lack of access to healthcare and may be more likely to die in the community from sudden complications (i.e. self-selection bias) and thus not be recorded.3) Testing for acute infection requires swabbing of the mucosal epithelium, which may be disrupted in current smokers, potentially altering the sensitivity of assays 39 . 7) Smokers with COVID-19 may be less likely to receive a SARS-CoV-2 test or present to hospital due to lack of access to healthcare and may be more likely to die in the community from sudden complications (i.e. self-selection bias) and thus not be recorded.</p>
        <p>8) If there is a protective effect of nicotine on COVID-19 disease outcomes, abrupt nicotine withdrawal upon hospitalisation may lead to worse outcomes 12 . 9) During periods of heightened demand of limited healthcare resources, current and former smokers with extensive comorbidities may have reduced priority for intensive care admission, thus leading to higher in-hospital mortality.8) If there is a protective effect of nicotine on COVID-19 disease outcomes, abrupt nicotine withdrawal upon hospitalisation may lead to worse outcomes 12 . 9) During periods of heightened demand of limited healthcare resources, current and former smokers with extensive comorbidities may have reduced priority for intensive care admission, thus leading to higher in-hospital mortality.</p>
        <p>10) Given lack of knowledge of the disease progression and long-term outcomes of COVID-19, it is unclear whether studies conducted thus far in the pandemic have monitored patients for a sufficient time period to report complete survival outcomes or whether they are subject to early censoring.10) Given lack of knowledge of the disease progression and long-term outcomes of COVID-19, it is unclear whether studies conducted thus far in the pandemic have monitored patients for a sufficient time period to report complete survival outcomes or whether they are subject to early censoring.</p>
        <p>11) Reasons for hospitalisation vary by country and time in the pandemic. For example, early cases may have been hospitalised for isolation and quarantine reasons and not due to medical necessity. It is plausible this may have skewed early data towards less severe cases. In addition, the observed association between former smoking and greater disease severity may be explained by collider bias 43 , where conditioning on a collider (e.g. testing or hospitalisation) by design or analysis may introduce a spurious association between current or former smoking (a potential cause of testing or hospitalisation) and SARS-CoV-2 infection/adverse outcomes from COVID-19 (potentially exacerbated by smoking) 44 .11) Reasons for hospitalisation vary by country and time in the pandemic.

        <p>This living rapid evidence review was limited by having a single reviewer extracting data with a second independently verifying the data extracted to minimise errors, restricting the search to one electronic database and one pre-print server and by not including at least three large population surveys due to their reliance on self-reported suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (which means they do not meet our eligibility criteria) 35,45,46 . We also did not include a large, UK-based, representative seroprevalence study 47 in our meta-analyses as the odds of testing positive in former smokers was not reported. However, the odds of infection for current smokers (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.58-0.71) was in concordance with the pooled estimate in our meta-analysis. Population surveysparticularly with linked data on confirmed infection or antibodies -will be included in future review versions to help mitigate some of the limitations of healthcare based observational studies. The comparisons of current and former smoking prevalence in the included studies with national prevalence estimates did not adjust observed prevalence for the demographic profile of those tested/admitted to hospital. Other reviews focused on this comparison have applied adjustments for sex and age, and continue to find lower than expected prevalence -notwithstanding the issues complicating interpretation described above 17 .This living rapid evidence review was limited by having a single reviewer extracting data with a second independently verifying the data extracted to minimise errors, restricting the search to one electronic database and one pre-print server and by not including at least three large population surveys due to their reliance on self-reported suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (which means they do not meet our eligibility criteria) 35,45,46 .

        <p>Further scientific research is needed to resolve the mixed findings summarised in our review.

        <p>Such trials should focus on medicinal nicotine (as smoked tobacco is a dirty delivery mechanism that could mask beneficial effects) and potentially differentiate between different modes of delivery (i.e. inhaled vs. ingested) since this can affect pharmacokinetics 48 and potential therapeutic effects. A second research priority would be a large, representative (randomly sampled) population survey with a validated assessment of smoking status which distinguishes between recent and long-term ex-smokers -ideally biochemically verified -and assesses seroprevalence and links to health records.Such trials should focus on medicinal nicotine (as smoked tobacco is a dirty delivery mechanism that could mask beneficial effects) and potentially differentiate between different modes of delivery (i.e. inhaled vs. ingested) since this can affect pharmacokinetics 48 and potential therapeutic effects.
