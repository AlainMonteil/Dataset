        <p>DHD is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder that affects around 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide 1 . ADHD is often persistent and markedly impairing, with increased risk of harmful outcomes, such as injuries 2 , traffic accidents 3 , increased healthcare utilization 4,5 , substance abuse 6 , criminality 7 , unemployment 8 , divorce 4 , suicide 9 , AIDS risk behaviors 8 and premature mortality 10 . Epidemiologic and clinical studies implicate genetic and environmental risk factors that affect the structure and functional capacity of brain networks involved in behavior and cognition 1 in the etiology of ADHD.DHD is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder that affects around 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide 1 .

        <p>Consensus estimates from more than 30 twin studies indicate that the heritability of ADHD is 70-80% throughout the lifespan 11,12 and that environmental risks are those not shared by siblings 13 . Twin studies also suggest that diagnosed ADHD represents the extreme tail of one or more heritable quantitative traits 14 . Additionally, family and twin studies report genetic overlap between ADHD and other conditions, including antisocial personality disorder/behaviors 15 , cognitive impairment 16 , autism spectrum disorder 17,18 , schizophrenia 19 , bipolar disorder 20 , and major depressive disorder 21 .Consensus estimates from more than 30 twin studies indicate that the heritability of ADHD is 70-80% throughout the lifespan 11,12 and that environmental risks are those not shared by siblings 13 .

        <p>Thus far, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify common DNA variants that increase the risk of ADHD have not been successful 22 . Nevertheless, genome-wide SNP heritability estimates range from 0.10-0.28 (ref. 23,24 ), supporting the notion that common variants comprise a significant fraction of the risk underlying ADHD 25 and that with increasing sample size, and thus, increasing statistical power, genome-wide significant loci will emerge.Thus far, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify common DNA variants that increase the risk of ADHD have not been successful 22 .

        <p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the common variant risk, also referred to as the SNP heritability, of ADHD is also associated with depression 25 , conduct problems 26 , schizophrenia 27 , continuous measures of ADHD symptoms 28,29 and other neurodevelopmental traits 29 in the population.

        <p>Here, we present a genome-wide meta-analysis identifying the first genome-wide significant loci for ADHD using a combined sample of 55,374 individuals from an international collaboration. We also strengthen the case that the clinical diagnosis of ADHD is the extreme expression of one or more heritable quantitative traits, at least as it pertains to common variant genetic risk, by integrating our results with previous GWASs of ADHD-related behavior in the general population.Here, we present a genome-wide meta-analysis identifying the first genome-wide significant loci for ADHD using a combined sample of 55,374 individuals from an international collaboration.

        <p>Genome-wide significantly associated ADHD risk loci. Genotype array data for 20,183 individuals with ADHD and 35,191 controls were collected from 12 cohorts (Supplementary Table 1). These samples included a population-based cohort of 14,584 individuals with ADHD and 22,492 controls from Denmark collected by the Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrative Psychiatric Research (iPSYCH; Supplementary Fig. 1), and 11 European, North American and Chinese cohorts aggregated by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). Individuals with ADHD in iPSYCH were identified from the national Psychiatric Central Research Register and diagnosed by psychiatrists at a psychiatric hospital according to ICD10 (F90.0) and then genotyped using Illumina PsychChip. Designs for the PGC cohorts have been described previously 22,24,25,31,32 (detailed cohort descriptions in Supplementary Note).

        <p>Prior to analysis, stringent quality control procedures were performed on the genotyped markers and individuals in each cohort using a standardized pipeline 33 (Methods).

        <p>GWAS was conducted in each cohort using logistic regression with the imputed additive genotype dosages. Principal components were included as covariates to correct for population stratification 35 (Supplementary Note), and variants with imputation INFO score &lt; 0.8 or minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt; 0.01 were excluded. The GWASs were then meta-analyzed using an inverse-variance weighted fixed effects model 36 . The single Chinese cohort included had insufficient sample size for well-powered transethnic modeling (Supplementary Fig. 2). Association results were considered only for variants with an effective sample size &gt; 70% of the full metaanalysis, leaving 8,047,421 variants in the final meta-analysis. A meta-analysis restricted to individuals of European ancestry (19,099 with ADHD, 34,194 controls) was also performed to facilitate secondary analyses (Supplementary Note). In total, 304 genetic variants in 12 loci surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 Ã— 10 -8 ; Fig. 1, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Results for the European ancestry meta-analysis were substantively similar (Supplementary Fig. 4). No marker demonstrated significant heterogeneity between studies (Supplementary Figs. 5 and6), and no heterogeneity was observed between the Chinese and European ancestry cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 2). Conditional analysis within each locus did not identify any independent secondary signals meeting genomewide significance (Methods; Supplementary Table 2).GWAS was conducted in each cohort using logistic regression with the imputed additive genotype dosages.

        <p>No genome-wide significant heterogeneity was observed in the ADHD GWAS meta-analysis (Supplementary Note). A genetic correlation analysis (Methods) provided further evidence that effects were consistent across cohort study designs. The estimated genetic correlation between the European ancestry PGC samples and the iPSYCH sample from linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression 37 was not significantly less than 1 (r g = 1.17, standard error (SE) = 0.20). The correlation between European ancestry PGC case/control and trio cohorts estimated with bivariate GREML was similarly close to 1 (r g = 1.02, SE = 0.32; Supplementary Table 3).No genome-wide significant heterogeneity was observed in the ADHD GWAS meta-analysis (Supplementary Note).

        <p>Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) 38 were also consistent across target samples. PRSs computed in each PGC study using iPSYCH as the training sample were consistently higher in ADHD compared with controls or pseudocontrols (Supplementary Fig. 7). Increasing deciles of PRS in the PGC were associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) for ADHD (Fig. 2). A similar pattern was seen in five-fold cross-validation in the iPSYCH cohort, with PRS for each subset computed from the other four iPSYCH subsets and the PGC samples used as training samples (Methods; Fig. 2). Across iPSYCH subsets, the mean of the maximum variance explained by the estimated PRS (Nagelkerke's R 2 ) was 5.5% (SE = 0.0012) (Supplementary Fig. 8). The difference in standardized PRS between cases and controls was stable across iPSYCH subsets (OR = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.53-1.60; Supplementary Fig. 9) and across waves and PGC cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 10). These results further support the notion of highly polygenic architecture of ADHD and demonstrate that ADHD risk is significantly associated with PRS in a dosedependent manner.Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) 38 were also consistent across target samples.

        <p>Polygenic architecture of ADHD. To assess the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by common variants, we applied LD score regression 37 to results from the European ancestry meta-analysis (Methods). Assuming a population prevalence of 5% for ADHD 39 , we estimated the liability-scale SNP heritability as h 2 SNP = 0.216 (SE = 0.014, P = 8.18 Ã— 10 -54 ; Supplementary Table 4). These estimated polygenic effects account for 88% (SE = 0.0335) of observed genome-wide inflation of the test statistics in the meta-analysis (Î» = 1.200; quantile-quantile plots in Supplementary Fig. 11); the remaining inflation, which may reflect confounding factors, such as cryptic relatedness and population stratification, is significant but modest (intercept = 1.0362, SE = 0.0099, P = 2.27 Ã— 10 -4 ).Polygenic architecture of ADHD.

        <p>To further characterize the patterns of heritability from the genome-wide association data, we partitioned SNP heritability by functional annotations, as described in Finucane et al. 40 , using partitioned LD score regression (Methods). The analysis found significant enrichment in the heritability from SNPs located in conserved regions (P = 8.49 Ã— 10 -10 ; Supplementary Fig. 12), supporting their biological importance. Enrichment of the SNP heritability in cell-type-specific regulatory elements was evaluated using the cell-type-specific group annotations described in Finucane et al. 40 . We observed a significant enrichment of the average per SNP heritability for variants located in central nervous system-specific regulatory elements (enrichment = 2.44, SE = 0.35, P = 5.81 Ã— 10 -5 ; Supplementary Figs. 13 and14).To further characterize the patterns of heritability from the genome-wide association data, we partitioned SNP heritability by functional annotations, as described in Finucane et al. 40 , using partitioned LD score regression (Methods).

        <p>For the positive genetic correlation with major depressive disorder (r g = 0.42, P = 7.38 Ã— 10 -38 ), we also observed a positive correlation with depressive symptoms (r g = 0.45, P = 7.00 Ã— 10 -19 ), neuroticism (r g = 0.26, P = 1.02 Ã— 10 -8 ) and a negative correlation with subjective well-being (r g = -0.28, P = 3.73 Ã— 10 -9 ).

For the 12 genome-wide significant loci, Bayesian credible sets were defined to identify the set of variants at each locus most likely to include a variant with causal effect (Methods, Supplementary Data 2 and Supplementary Table 6). Biological annotations of the variants in the credible set were then considered to identify functional or regulatory variants, common chromatin marks, and variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs) or in regions with gene interactions observed in Hi-C data (Methods; Supplementary Data 3).

        <p>Here, we highlight genes that are identified in the regions of association (also Supplementary Table 7). The loci on chromosomes 2, 7 and 10 each have credible sets localized to a single gene with limited additional annotations. In the chromosome 7 locus, FOXP2 encodes a forkhead/winged-helix transcription factor and is known to play an important role in synapse formation and neural mechanisms mediating the development of speech and learning [63][64][65] . Comorbidity of ADHD with specific developmental disorders of language and learning is common (7-11%) 66,67 , and poor language skills have been associated with higher inattention or hyperactivity symptoms in primary school 68 . On chromosome 10, the ADHD association is intronic, located in SORCS3, which encodes a brainexpressed transmembrane receptor that is important for neuronal development and plasticity 69 and has previously been associated with depression 43,70 .Here, we highlight genes that are identified in the regions of association (also Supplementary Table 7).

        <p>Genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 12 and 15 have more biological annotations supporting the colocalized genes. The credible set on chromosome 12 spans DUSP6 and includes an annotated missense variant in the first exon and an insertion near the transcription start site, though neither is the lead variant in the locus (Supplementary Data 4). DUSP6 encodes a dual specificity phosphatase 71 and may play a role in regulating neurotransmitter homeostasis by affecting dopamine levels in the synapses 72,73 . Regulation of dopamine levels is likely to be relevant to ADHD, as widely used ADHD medications have dopaminergic targets 74,75 that increase the availability of synaptic dopamine. The chromosome 15 locus is located in SEMA6D, and the majority of variants in the credible set are strongly associated with expression of SEMA6D in fibroblasts 76 . SEMA6D is active in the brain during embryonic development and may play a role in neuronal wiring 77 .

        <p>Credible set annotations at the remaining loci are more diverse (Supplementary Data 3). The most strongly associated locus on chromosome 1 (index variant rs112984125) covers a gene-rich 250-kb region of strong LD. The index variant is intronic to ST3GAL3, and most SNPs in the credible set are strongly associated with expression of ST3GAL3 in whole blood 79 (Supplementary Data 3). Missense mutations in ST3GAL3 have been shown to cause autosomal recessive intellectual disability 80 . Hi-C and eQTL annotations suggest multiple alternative genes, however, including PTPRF (Supplementary Data 4).

        <p>On chromosome 5, the credible set includes links to LINC00461 and TMEM161B (Supplementary Data 3). The function of LINC00461 is unclear, but the RNA has highly localized expression in the brain 81 , and the genome-wide significant locus overlaps with variants in LINC00461 associated with educational attainment 78 . Alternatively, a genome-wide significant SNP in this locus (rs304132) is located in MEF2C-AS1, of strong interest given previous associations between MEF2C and severe intellectual disability [82][83][84] , cerebral malformation 83 , depression 70 , schizophrenia 33 and Alzheimer's disease 85 , but the corresponding variant is not supported by the credible set analysis. Credible set annotations for other significant loci are similarly cryptic.On chromosome 5, the credible set includes links to LINC00461 and TMEM161B (Supplementary Data 3). The function of LINC00461 is unclear, but the RNA has highly localized expression in the brain 81 , and the genome-wide significant locus overlaps with variants in LINC00461 associated with educational attainment 78 .

        <p>Competitive gene-based tests were performed for FOXP2 target genes, highly constrained genes and for all Gene Ontology terms 86 from MsigDB 6.0 (ref. 87 ) using MAGMA 88 (Methods). Association results for individual genes are consistent with the genome-wide significant loci for the GWAS (Supplementary Table 8); however, four new genes passed the threshold for exomewide significant association (Supplementary Fig. 15a-d). Three independent sets of FOXP2 downstream target genes 89,90 were tested (Methods), none of which demonstrated significant association to ADHD (Supplementary Table 9). The lack of association might be caused by unknown functions of FOXP2 driving ADHD risk, insufficient power to detect relevant downstream genes or because only a small subset of biological functions regulated by FOXP2 are relevant to ADHD pathogenesis. 5). In total, 219 traits were tested, and only traits significant after Bonferroni correction are presented. Results are omitted for significant correlations with two previous GWAS of years of schooling and two GWAS whose the discovery sample was not restricted to European ancestry. Genetic correlation is presented as a dot and error bars indicate 95% confidence limits.Competitive gene-based tests were performed for FOXP2 target genes, highly constrained genes and for all Gene Ontology terms 86 from MsigDB 6.0 (ref. 87 ) using MAGMA 88 (Methods).

        <p>Replication of GWAS loci. For replication, we evaluated the comparison of the GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD with three other independent ADHD-related GWASs: replication of top loci in an Icelandic cohort with ADHD status derived from medical records of ICD codes and medication history by deCODE (5,085 with ADHD, 131,122 controls), a GWAS of self-reported ADHD status among 23andMe research participants (5,857 with ADHD, 70,393 controls) and a meta-analysis of GWAS of childhood rating scales of ADHD symptoms performed by the EAGLE consortium (17,666 children &lt; 13 years of age) 30 and QIMR 92 (2,798 adolescents), referred to as EAGLE/QIMR hereafter.

        <p>Top loci from the ADHD GWAS showed moderate concordance across the three replication studies. Sign concordance between each of the three replication cohorts and the ADHD GWAS was significantly greater than what would be expected by chance (range 72-82% concordant; P &lt; 0.0167 = 0.05/3 replication cohorts; Supplementary Table 12) for nominally associated loci from the ADHD GWAS (P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -6 ), with the highest concordance observed in EAGLE/QIMR. The deCODE and 23andMe results also permit direct comparisons of the magnitude of effect sizes for the top loci in the ADHD GWAS (Supplementary Table 13). Regressing effect size estimates from each replication cohort on estimates from the ADHD GWAS adjusted for winner's curse yields significantly positive slopes (deCODE slope = 0.664, P = 1.2 Ã— 10 -4 ; 23andMe slope = 0.417, P = 1.11 Ã— 10 -3 ), although these slopes are less than one, suggesting imperfect replication. Among the genomewide significant loci, rs9677504 (SPAG16 locus) in deCODE and rs112984125 (ST3GAL3/PTPRF locus) and rs212178 (LINC01572 locus) in 23andMe are notable outliers with weak replication results (Methods; Supplementary Figs. 16 and17).Top loci from the ADHD GWAS showed moderate concordance across the three replication studies.

        <p>The genome-wide data available from 23andMe and EAGLE/ QIMR showed similar trends for replication. The genetic correlation between EAGLE/QIMR and the ADHD GWAS was extremely strong (r g = 0.970, SE = 0.207, P = 2.66 Ã— 10 -6 ) and not significantly different from 1 (one-sided P = 0.442). Genetic correlation with the 23andMe results was weaker but still strongly positive (r g = 0.653, SE = 0.114, P = 1.11 Ã— 10 -8 ), although also significantly less than 1 (one-sided P = 1.17 Ã— 10 -3 ). To explore this lower correlation, we evaluated the genetic correlation between 23andMe and traits from LD Hub (see URLs) 42 to potentially identify differences in the profile of genetic correlations compared with the ADHD GWAS (Methods). This comparison identified striking differences (Supplementary Table 14), most notably that the 23andMe GWAS shows little to no genetic correlation with college completion (r g = 0.056, compared with r g = -0.54 for the primary ADHD GWAS; approximate P = 1.1 Ã— 10 -9 for difference) and other education-related phenotypes. Genetic correlations with obesity-related phenotypes were similarly smaller for the 23andMe cohort. The domains in which 23andMe exhibited a trend toward stronger genetic correlations were schizophrenia (r g = 0.27 vs. r g = 0.12 in ADHD, P = 0.053) and bipolar disorder (r g = 0.029 vs. r g = 0.095 in ADHD, P = 0.09), although these trends are not significant with the approximated test of the difference in genetic correlation.The genome-wide data available from 23andMe and EAGLE/ QIMR showed similar trends for replication.

        <p>Finally, we meta-analyzed the ADHD GWAS with each replication cohort. For EAGLE/QIMR, we developed a novel model to meta-analyze the GWAS of the continuous measure of ADHD with the clinical diagnosis in the ADHD GWAS. In brief, we perform a z-score based meta-analysis using a weighting scheme derived from the SNP heritability and effective sample size for each phenotype that fully accounts for the differences in measurement scale (detailed description in Supplementary Note and Supplementary Figs. 18-20). This calibration based on the genome-wide estimate of heritability prevents joint meta-analysis of all replication cohorts because genome-wide data is not available for the deCODE study.Finally, we meta-analyzed the ADHD GWAS with each replication cohort.

Of the 12 significant loci from the primary ADHD GWAS, four were significant in all three of these replication meta-analyses: index variants rs11420276 (ST3GAL3/PTPRF), rs5886709 (FOXP2), rs11591402 (SORCS3), and rs1427829 (intergenic). The remaining loci were all significant in at least one of the replication meta-analyses.

        <p>Meta-analysis with the 23andMe cohort also found genome-wide significant heterogeneity at the lead chromosome 1 locus from the ADHD GWAS meta-analysis (rs12410155: I 2 = 97.2, P = 2.29 Ã— 10 -9 ; Supplementary Figs. 23 and24). This heterogeneity is consistent with the moderate sign concordance, effect size replication and genetic correlation of the 23andMe cohort with the ADHD GWAS. Notably, the lead chromosome 1 locus in the ADHD GWAS overlaps a reported association with educational attainment 78 , suggesting that this heterogeneity is consistent with the much weaker genetic correlation between the 23andMe results and published GWAS of education-related outcomes.

        <p>Our GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD identified the first genomewide significant risk loci and indicates an important role for common variants in the polygenic architecture of ADHD. Several of the loci are located in or near genes that implicate neurodevelopmental processes that are likely to be relevant to ADHD, including FOXP2, SORCS3 and DUSP6. Future work might focus on refining the source of the strong association in each locus, especially the lead locus on chromosome 1, which is complicated by broad LD and substantial heterogeneity between the main metaanalysis of ADHD and the analysis of self-reported ADHD status in 23andMe.Our GWAS meta-analysis of ADHD identified the first genomewide significant risk loci and indicates an important role for common variants in the polygenic architecture of ADHD.

        <p>The 12 significant loci are compelling, but only capture a tiny fraction of common variant risk for ADHD. The ORs for the risk increasing allele at the index SNPs in the 12 significant loci are modest, ranging from 1.077 to 1.198 (Table 1). This is within the range of effect sizes for common genetic variants that has been observed for other highly polygenic psychiatric disorders, for example, schizophrenia 33 . A considerably larger proportion of the heritability of ADHD can be explained by all common variants (h 2 SNP = 0.22, SE = 0.01). This is consistent with previous estimates of h 2 SNP for ADHD in smaller studies (h 2 SNP : 0.1-0.28) 23,24 and also comparable to SNP heritability estimates for schizophrenia (h 2 SNP 0.23-0.26) 23,24 . As would be hypothesized for a psychiatric disorder, these effects are enriched in conserved regions and regions containing enhancers and promoters of expression in central nervous system tissues, consistent with previous observations in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 40 .

        <p>Along with polygenicity, selection and evolutionary pressures might be an important feature of the architecture of ADHD genetics. We observe that ADHD risk variants are strongly enriched in genomic regions conserved in mammals 94 , and constrained genes likely to be intolerant to loss-of-function mutations 91 are associated with ADHD. We also find that common variant risk for ADHD is genetically correlated with having children younger and having more children, in line with epidemiological findings of increased risky sexual behavior [95][96][97] and increased risk of ADHD for children born to young parents [98][99][100] . Given the phenotypic 101,102 and genetic 103 correlation of ADHD with reduced educational attainment, positive selective pressure on the genetics of ADHD would be consistent with recently published work suggesting that variants associated with educational attainment are under negative selection in Iceland 104 . Future studies of fecundity and the role of rare and de novo variants in ADHD might provide more insight on selective pressures in ADHD-associated loci.Along with polygenicity, selection and evolutionary pressures might be an important feature of the architecture of ADHD genetics.

        <p>The observed genetic correlations with educational outcomes and other phenotypes suggest a strong genetic component to the epidemiological correlates of ADHD. The significant positive genetic correlation of ADHD with major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms supports previous findings that suggest a positive genetic overlap between those phenotypes 24,42 , as well as the broader genetic overlap of psychiatric disorders 23,24 . Positive genetic correlations between ADHD and health risk behaviors such as smoking and obesity are consistent with the observed increase in those behaviors among individuals with ADHD [105][106][107][108] and are indicative of a shared genetic basis for these traits. We also observed a positive genetic correlation of ADHD with insomnia, consistent with reports of sleep disturbances in ADHD 109 , but this relationship does not appear to generalize to other sleep-related phenotypes.The observed genetic correlations with educational outcomes and other phenotypes suggest a strong genetic component to the epidemiological correlates of ADHD.

The pattern of replication for the top loci in the deCODE study is stronger but still mixed. These differences may reflect dissimilarities in phenotyping (for example self-report vs. medical records), exclusion of individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders (deCODE), study population (for example, higher average education and socioeconomic status among 23andMe research participants possibly underrepresenting the proportion of individuals with ADHD with poor educational outcomes in the general population) or other study factors that should be a focus of future work.These genetic correlations might not generalize to all settings.

        <p>On the other hand, the replication results from EAGLE 30 /QIMR 92 are much stronger and support the hypothesis that ADHD is the extreme expression of one or more heritable quantitative traits 110 . We observe strong concordance between the GWAS of ADHD and the previous GWASs of ADHD-related traits in the population, both in terms of genome-wide genetic correlation and concordance at individual loci. Polygenic risk for ADHD has previously been associated with inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive trait variation below clinical thresholds in the population 29 . Shared genetic risk with health risk behaviors may similarly be hypothesized to reflect an impaired ability to self-regulate and inhibit impulsive behavior 111,112 . The observed negative correlation between ADHD and anorexia nervosa might also be related to these behavioral factors.On the other hand, the replication results from EAGLE 30 /QIMR 92 are much stronger and support the hypothesis that ADHD is the extreme expression of one or more heritable quantitative traits 110 .

        <p>In summary, we report 12 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with ADHD in a GWAS meta-analysis of 55,374 individuals from 12 study cohorts. The GWAS meta-analysis implicates FOXP2 and other biologically informative genes as well as constrained regions of the genome as important contributors to the etiology of ADHD. The results also highlight strong overlap with the genetics of ADHD-related traits and health risk behaviors in the population, encouraging a dimensional view of ADHD as the extreme end of a continuum of symptoms.In summary, we report 12 independent genome-wide significant loci associated with ADHD in a GWAS meta-analysis of 55,374 individuals from 12 study cohorts.

        <p>Partitioning of the heritability. SNP heritability was partitioned by functional category and tissue association using LD score regression 40 . Partitioning was performed for 53 overlapping functional categories, as well as 220 cell-typespecific annotations grouped into 10 cell-type groups, as described in Finucane et al. 40 .

        <p>Additionally, we expanded the cell-type specific heritability analysis by including an annotation based on information about H3K4Me1 imputed gapped peaks excluding the broad MHC-region (chr6:25-35MB), generated by the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium 121,122 (Supplementary Note). The analyses were restricted to the European GWAS meta-analysis results to ensure matching of population LD structure.

For each cell-type group and each H3K4Me1 cell-type annotations, the contribution to SNP heritability was tested conditional on the baseline model containing the 53 functional categories.Additionally, we expanded the cell-type specific heritability analysis by including an annotation based on information about H3K4Me1 imputed gapped peaks excluding the broad MHC-region (chr6:25-35MB), generated by the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium 121,122 (Supplementary Note).

        <p>The genetic correlations of ADHD with other phenotypes were evaluated using LD score regression 42 . For a given pair of traits, LD score regression estimates the expected population correlation between the best possible linear SNP-based predictor for each trait, restricting to common SNPs. Such correlation of genetic risk may reflect a combination of colocalization, pleiotropy, shared biological mechanisms, and causal relationships between traits. Correlations were tested for 211 phenotypes with publically available GWAS summary statistics using LD Hub 41 (Supplementary Note; URLs). Additionally, we analyzed on our local computer cluster the genetic correlation of ADHD with eight phenotypes: human intelligence 103 , four phenotypes related to education and cognition analyzed in samples from the UK Biobank 49 (college/university degree, verbal-numerical reasoning, memory and reaction time), insomnia 60 , anorexia nervosa 44 , and major depressive disorder 43 . The genetic correlation with major depressive disorder was tested using GWAS results from an updated analysis of 130,664 cases with major depressive disorder and 330,470 controls from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. As in the previous LD score regression analyses, this estimation was based on summary statistics from the European GWAS meta-analysis, and significant correlations reported are for traits analyzed using individuals with European ancestry. Credible set analysis. We defined a credible set of variants in each locus using the method described by Maller et al. 123 . (Supplementary Note), implemented by a freely available 
            <rs type="software">R</rs>
            <rs type="software">script</rs> (URLs). Under the assumption that (a) there is one causal variant in each locus, and (b) the causal variant is observed in the genotype data, the credible set can be considered to have a 99% probability of containing the causal variant. For each the 12 genome-wide significant loci, variants within 1 MB and in LD with correlation r 2 &gt; 0.4 to the index variant were considered for inclusion in the credible set analysis. The credible set analysis was done using the European GWAS meta-analysis to ensure consistent LD structure in the analyzed cohorts.
        </p>
        <p>Biological annotation of variants in credible set. The variants in the credible set for each locus were annotated based on external reference data in order to evaluate potential functional consequences. In particular, we identify: (a) gene and regulatory consequences annotated by Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) using 
            <rs type="software">Ensembl</rs> with genome build GRCh37 124 . We exclude upstream and downstream consequences, and consequences for transcripts that lack a HGNC gene symbol (for example vega genes). (b) Variants within 2 kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of at least one gene isoform based on Gencode v19 125 . (c) Variants annotated as interacting with a given gene in Hi-C data from samples of developing human cerebral cortex during neurogenesis and migration 126 . Annotations are considered for both the germinal zone (GZ), primarily consisting of actively dividing neural progenitors, and the cortical and subcortical plate (CP), primarily consisting of post-mitotic neurons. (d) Variants identified as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) based on gene expression in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) 127 project database or BIOS 79 . Expression quantitative trait loci were annotated using FUMA (see URLs). We restricted to eQTL associations with NATuRE GENETICS | www.nature.com/naturegenetics Articles NATure GeNeTiCS false discovery fate (FDR) &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -3 within each dataset. (e) Chromatin states of each variant based on the 15-state chromHMM analysis of epigenomics data from Roadmap 121 . The 15 states summarize to annotations of active chromatin marks (that is Active TSS, Flanking Active TSS, Flanking Transcription, Strong Transcription, Weak Transcription, Genic Enhancer, Enhancer, or Zinc Finger [ZNF] gene), repressed chromatin marks (Heterochromatin, Bivalent TSS, Flanking Bivalent TSS, Bivalent Enhancer, Repressed Polycomb, or Weak Repressed Polycomb), or quiescent. The most common chromatin state across 127 tissue/cell types was annotated using FUMA (see URLs). We also evaluated the annotated chromatin state from fetal brain.

        <p>Gene-set analyses. Gene-based association with ADHD was estimated with MAGMA 1.05 88 using the summary statistics from the European GWAS metaanalysis (N cases = 19,099, N controls = 34,194; Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1). Association was tested using the SNP-wise mean model, in which the sum of -log(SNP P-value) for SNPs located within the transcribed region (defined using NCBI 37.3 gene definitions) was used as the test statistic. MAGMA accounts for gene-size, number of SNPs in a gene and LD between markers when estimating gene-based P-values.

        <p>To replicate the results of the ADHD GWAS metaanalysis, we compared the results to those of analyses of cohorts from deCODE and 23andMe, and a meta-analysis of two independent studies conducted by EAGLE and QIMR (referred to as EAGLE/QIMR). We evaluated evidence for replication based on: (a) sign tests of concordance between the ADHD GWAS meta-analysis and each replication cohort; (b) comparison of bias-corrected effect sizes between the ADHD GWAS and the deCODE and 23andMe replication cohorts; (c) genetic correlation between the ADHD GWAS and the 23andMe and EAGLE/QIMR replication cohorts; (d) meta-analysis of the ADHD GWAS meta-analysis results with the results from each replication cohort; and (e) tests of heterogeneity between the ADHD GWAS and each replication cohort.To replicate the results of the ADHD GWAS metaanalysis, we compared the results to those of analyses of cohorts from deCODE and 23andMe, and a meta-analysis of two independent studies conducted by EAGLE and QIMR (referred to as EAGLE/QIMR).

        <p>For the sign test, we first identified the overlapping SNPs present in the ADHD GWAS and each of the three replication analyses (that is deCODE, 23andMe, and EAGLE/QIMR). For each replication cohort intersecting SNPs were then clumped for LD (r 2 &gt; 0.05 within 1 Mb) for all variants with P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -4 in the ADHD GWAS (or P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -5 for the deCODE replication) using 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data on European ancestry populations. After clumping, sign tests were performed to test the proportion of loci with a concordant direction of effect in the replication cohort (Ï€ ) using a one sample test of the proportion with Yates' continuity correction 128 against a null hypothesis of Ï€ = 0.50 (i.e., the signs are concordant between the two analyses by chance) in R 129 . This test was evaluated separately for concordance in deCODE, 23andMe, and EAGLE/QIMR for loci passing P-value thresholds of P &lt; 5 Ã— 10 -8 (i.e., genome-wide significant loci), P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -7 , P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -6 , P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -5 , and P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -4 in the ADHD GWAS metaanalysis (Supplementary Note).For the sign test, we first identified the overlapping SNPs present in the ADHD GWAS and each of the three replication analyses (that is deCODE, 23andMe, and EAGLE/QIMR).

        <p>In addition to testing concordance for the direction of effect, we also evaluated replication for the magnitude of the effect sizes. Specifically, for each of deCODE and 23andMe we regressed the effect size in the replication cohort (that is the log odds ratio) on the estimated effect size from the ADHD GWAS after adjustment for winner's curse for loci with P &lt; 1 Ã— 10 -6 .

        <p>For the regression of effect sizes we oriented all variants in the direction of the risk increasing allele estimated from the ADHD GWAS, constrained the intercept to zero, and weighted the variants proportional to the inverse of their squared standard error from the ADHD GWAS. A regression slope of one indicates "ideal" replication of all loci in the regression, whereas a slope of zero indicates no replication. Genetic correlation of the ADHD GWAS with the 23andMe and EAGLE/ QIMR results was computed using LD score regression 37 with pre-computed European ancestry LD scores following the same procedure as described above for other genetic correlation analyses. Genetic correlation could not be computed for deCODE since results were only available for top loci from the ADHD GWAS.

        <p>Finally, we meta-analyzed the ADHD GWAS with the results from each replication cohort. For deCODE and 23andMe inverse variance-weighted metaanalyses were performed. For meta-analysis with the EAGLE/QIMR GWAS of ADHD-related behaviors in childhood population samples we used a modified sample size-based weighting method. Modified sample size-based weights were derived to account for the respective heritabilities, genetic correlation, and measurement scale of the GWASs (Supplementary Note). To summarize, given z scores Z 1j and Z 2j resulting from GWAS of SNP j in a dichotomous phenotype (for example ADHD) with sample size N 1 and a continuous phenotype (for example ADHD-related traits) with sample size N 2 , respectively, we calculate The adjusted sample sizes Ã‘ 1 and Ã‘ 2 reflect differences in power between the studies due to measurement scale and relative heritability that is not captured by sample size. The calculation of Z 2 reduces the contribution of the continuous phenotype's GWAS to the meta-analysis based on imperfect genetic correlation with the dichotomous phenotype of interest (that is ADHD). The adjustments are computed based on the sample prevalence (P) and population prevalence (K) of the dichotomous phenotype, the estimated liability scale SNP heritability of the two phenotypes (h 1 2 and h 2 2 ), and the genetic correlation (r g ) between the two phenotypes, as well as the average SNP LD score (l j ) and the number of SNPs (M). Heritability and genetic correlation values to compute these weights are computed using LD score regression. This meta-analysis weighting scheme is consistent with weights alternatively derived based on modelling the joint distribution of marginal GWAS beta across traits 130 .Finally, we meta-analyzed the ADHD GWAS with the results from each replication cohort.

        <p>GWAS meta-analysis. Quality control, imputation and primary association analyses were done using the bioinformatics pipeline 
            <rs type="software">Ricopili</rs> (see URLs), developed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) 33 . In order to avoid potential study effects, the 11 PGC samples and the 23 genotyping batches within iPSYCH were each processed separately unless otherwise stated (Supplementary Note).
        </p>
        <p>Stringent quality control was applied to each cohort following standard procedures for GWAS, including filters for call rate, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and heterozygosity rates (Supplementary Note). Each cohort was then phased and imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (1KGP3) 34,113 imputation reference panel using SHAPEIT 114 and IMPUTE2 (ref. 115 ), respectively. For trio cohorts, pseudocontrols were defined from phased haplotypes prior to imputation.Stringent quality control was applied to each cohort following standard procedures for GWAS, including filters for call rate, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and heterozygosity rates (Supplementary Note).

For trio cohorts, pseudocontrols were defined from phased haplotypes prior to imputation.</p>
        <p>Cryptic relatedness and population structure were evaluated using a set of high-quality markers pruned for linkage disequilibrium (LD). Genetic relatedness was estimated using 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> v
            <rs type="version">1.9</rs> (refs 116,117 ) to identify first and second-degree relatives (Ï€Ì‚ &gt; 0.2) and one individual was excluded from each related pair. Genetic outliers were identified for exclusion based on principal component analyses using EIGENSOFT 35,118 . This was done separately for each of the PGC cohorts and on a merged set of genotypes for the iPSYCH cohort (Supplementary Note). Across studies, a total of 20,183 cases and 35,191 controls remained for analysis after quality control.
        </p>
        <p>Genome-wide association analyses for the 11 PGC samples and the 23 waves in iPSYCH were performed using a logistic regression model with the imputed marker dosages in 
            <rs type="software">PLINK</rs> v
            <rs type="version">1.9</rs> (refs 116,117 ). Principal components were included as covariates to control for population stratification 35,118 , along with relevant studyspecific covariates where applicable (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1). Subsequently the results were meta-analyzed using an inverse-variance weighted fixed effects model, implemented in 
            <rs type="software">METAL</rs> (version 
            <rs type="version">2011-</rs>03-25) 36 . Variants were filtered and included if imputation quality (INFO score) was &gt; 0.8 and minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.01. Only markers supported by an effective sample size N eff = 4/(1/N cases + 1/N controls ) 119 &gt; 70% were included. After filtering, the metaanalysis included results for 8,047,421 markers.
        </p>
        <p>Twelve independent genome-wide significant loci were identified by LD clumping and merging loci within 400 kb (Supplementary Note). In two of these loci, a second index variant persisted after LD clumping. The two putative secondary signals were evaluated by considering analysis conditional on the lead index variant in each locus. In each cohort, logistic regression was performed with the imputed genotype dosage for the lead index variant included as a covariate. All covariates from the primary GWAS (for example, principal components) were also included. The conditional association results were then combined in an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.Twelve independent genome-wide significant loci were identified by LD clumping and merging loci within 400 kb (Supplementary Note).

        <p>European ancestry PGC and iPSYCH GWAS results was calculated using LD score regression 37 . The regression was performed using pre-computed LD scores for HapMap3 SNPs calculated based on 378 individuals of European ancestry from the 1000 Genomes Project (see URLs). Only results for markers with an imputation INFO score &gt; 0.90 were included in the analysis. Additionally, a bivariate GREML analysis was conducted using GCTA 120 to estimate the genetic correlation between PGC case/control and trio study designs.European ancestry PGC and iPSYCH GWAS results was calculated using LD score regression 37 .

        <p>Polygenic risk scores for ADHD. The iPSYCH sample were split into five groups, and, subsequently, five leave-one-out association analyses were conducted, using four out of five groups and the PGC samples as training datasets 38 . PRS were estimated for each target sample using variants passing a range of association P-value thresholds in the training samples. PRS were calculated by multiplying the natural log of the odds ratio of each variant by the allele dosage (imputation probability), and whole-genome polygenic risk scores were obtained by summing values over variants for each individual.Polygenic risk scores for ADHD.

For each target group and for each P-value threshold, the proportion of variance explained (Nagelkerke's R 2 ) was estimated by comparing the regression with PRS to a reduced model with covariates only. The OR for ADHD within each PRS decile group was estimated based on the normalized score across groups (using the P-value threshold with the highest Nagelkerke's R 2 within each target group) (Fig. 3). OR was also estimated using logistic regression on the continuous scores for each target group separately, and an OR based on all samples using the normalized PRS score across all groups (Supplementary Fig. 9).

        <p>SNP heritability and intercept evaluation. LD score regression 37 was used to evaluate the relative contribution of polygenic effects and confounding factors, such as cryptic relatedness and population stratification, to deviation from the null in the genome-wide distribution of GWAS Ï‡ 2 statistics. Analysis was performed using pre-computed LD scores from European-ancestry samples in the 1000 Genomes Project (see URLs) and summary statistics for the European-ancestry ADHD GWAS to ensure matching of population LD structure. The influence of confounding factors was tested by comparing the estimated intercept of the LD score regression to one, its expected value under the null hypothesis of no confounding from for example population stratification. The ratio between this deviation and the deviation of the mean Ï‡ 2 from one (that is it's expected value under the null hypothesis of no association) was used to estimate the proportion of inflation in Ï‡ 2 attributable to confounding as opposed to true polygenic effects (ratio = (intercept-1)/(mean Ï‡ 2 -1)). SNP heritability was estimated based on the slope of the LD score regression, with heritability on the liability scale calculated assuming a 5% population prevalence of ADHD 39 .SNP heritability and intercept evaluation.
