        <p>Yet, COVID-19 pneumonia [2], despite falling in most of the circumstances under the Berlin definition of ARDS [3], is a specific disease, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia often associated with near normal respiratory system compliance (more than 50% of the 150 patients measured by the authors and further confirmed by several colleagues in Northern Italy). This remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe ARDS. These severely hypoxemic patients despite sharing a single etiology (SARS-CoV-2) may present quite differently from one another: normally breathing ("silent" hypoxemia) or remarkably dyspneic; quite responsive to nitric oxide or not; deeply hypocapnic or normo/hypercapnic; and either responsive to prone position or not. Therefore, the same disease actually presents itself with impressive non-uniformity.Yet, COVID-19 pneumonia [2], despite falling in most of the circumstances under the Berlin definition of ARDS [3], is a specific disease, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia often associated with near normal respiratory system compliance (more than 50% of the 150 patients measured by the authors and further confirmed by several colleagues in Northern Italy).

        <p>Based on detailed observation of several cases and discussions with colleagues treating these patients, we hypothesize that the different COVID-19 patterns found at presentation in the emergency department depend on the interaction between three factors: (1) the severity of the infection, the host response, physiological reserve and comorbidities; (2) the ventilatory responsiveness of the patient to hypoxemia; (3) the time elapsed between the onset of the disease and the observation in the hospital.Based on detailed observation of several cases and discussions with colleagues treating these patients, we hypothesize that the different COVID-19 patterns found at presentation in the emergency department depend on the interaction between three factors: (1) the severity of the infection, the host response, physiological reserve and comorbidities; (2) the ventilatory responsiveness of the patient to hypoxemia; (3) the time elapsed between the onset of the disease and the observation in the hospital.</p>
        <p>The interaction between these factors leads to the development of a time-related disease spectrum within two primary "phenotypes": Type L, characterized by Low elastance (i.e., high compliance), Low ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, Low lung weight and Low recruitability and Type H, characterized by High elastance, High right-toleft shunt, High lung weight and High recruitability.The interaction between these factors leads to the development of a time-related disease spectrum within two primary "phenotypes": Type L, characterized by Low elastance (i.e., high compliance), Low ventilation-to-perfusion ratio, Low lung weight and Low recruitability and Type H, characterized by High elastance, High right-toleft shunt, High lung weight and High recruitability.</p>
        <p>At the beginning, COVID-19 pneumonia presents with the following characteristics:At the beginning, COVID-19 pneumonia presents with the following characteristics:</p>
        <p>• Low elastance. The nearly normal compliance indicates that the amount of gas in the lung is nearly normal [4]. • Low ventilation-to-perfusion (VA/Q) ratio. Since the gas volume is nearly normal, hypoxemia may be best explained by the loss of regulation of perfusion and by loss of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Accordingly, at this stage, the pulmonary artery pressure should be near normal.• Low elastance.

        <p>• Low lung weight. Only ground-glass densities are present on CT scan, primarily located subpleurally and along the lung fissures. Consequently, lung weight is only moderately increased. • Low lung recruitability. The amount of non-aerated tissue is very low; consequently, the recruitability is low [5].• Low lung weight.

The amount of non-aerated tissue is very low; consequently, the recruitability is low [5].</p>
        <p>To conceptualize these phenomena, we hypothesize the following sequence of events: the viral infection leads to a modest local subpleural interstitial edema (groundglass lesions) particularly located at the interfaces between lung structures with different elastic properties, where stress and strain are concentrated [6]. Vasoplegia accounts for severe hypoxemia. The normal response to hypoxemia is to increase minute ventilation, primarily by increasing the tidal volume [7] (up to 15-20 ml/ kg), which is associated with a more negative intrathoracic inspiratory pressure. Undetermined factors other than hypoxemia markedly stimulate, in these patients, the respiratory drive. The near normal compliance, however, explains why some of the patients present without dyspnea as the patient inhales the volume he expects. This increase in minute ventilation leads to a decrease in PaCO 2 .To conceptualize these phenomena, we hypothesize the following sequence of events: the viral infection leads to a modest local subpleural interstitial edema (groundglass lesions) particularly located at the interfaces between lung structures with different elastic properties, where stress and strain are concentrated [6].

        <p>The Type L patients may remain unchanging for a period and then improve or worsen. The possible key feature which determines the evolution of the disease, other than the severity of the disease itself, is the depth of the negative intrathoracic pressure associated with the increased tidal volume in spontaneous breathing. Indeed, the combination of a negative inspiratory intrathoracic pressure and increased lung permeability due to inflammation results in interstitial lung edema. This phenomenon, initially described by Barach in [8] and Mascheroni in [9] both in an experimental setting, has been recently recognized as the leading cause of patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) [10]. Over time, the increased edema increases lung weight, superimposed pressure and dependent atelectasis. When lung edema reaches a certain magnitude, the gas volume in the lung decreases, and the tidal volumes generated for a given inspiratory pressure decrease [11]. At this stage, dyspnea develops, which in turn leads to worsening P-SILI. The transition from Type L to Type H may be due to the evolution of the COVID-19 pneumonia on one hand and the injury attributable to high-stress ventilation on the other.The Type L patients may remain unchanging for a period and then improve or worsen.

        <p>Given this conceptual model, it follows that the respiratory treatment offered to Type L and Type H patients must be different. The proposed treatment is consistent with what observed in COVID-19, even though the overwhelming number of patients seen in this pandemic may limit its wide applicability.Given this conceptual model, it follows that the respiratory treatment offered to Type L and Type H patients must be different.

        <p>1. The first step to reverse hypoxemia is through an increase in FiO 2 to which the Type L patient responds well, particularly if not yet breathless. 2. In Type L patients with dyspnea, several noninvasive options are available: high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV). At this stage, the measurement (or the estimation) of the inspiratory esophageal pressure swings is crucial [13]. In the absence of the esophageal manometry, surrogate measures of work of breathing, such as the swings of central venous pressure [14] or clinical detection of excessive inspiratory effort, should be assessed. In intubated patients, the P0.1 and P occlusion should also be determined. High PEEP, in some patients, may decrease the pleural pressure swings and stop the vicious cycle that exacerbates lung injury. However, high PEEP in patients with normal compliance may have detrimental effects on hemodynamics. In any case, noninvasive options are questionable, as they may be associated with high failure rates and delayed intubation, in a disease which typically lasts several weeks. 3. The magnitude of inspiratory pleural pressures swings may determine the transition from the Type L to the Type H phenotype. As esophageal pressure swings increase from 5 to 10 cmH 2 O-which are generally well tolerated-to above 15 cmH 2 O, the risk of lung injury increases and therefore intubation should be performed as soon as possible.1.

        <p>4. Once intubated and deeply sedated, the Type L patients, if hypercapnic, can be ventilated with volumes greater than 6 ml/kg (up to 8-9 ml/kg), as the high compliance results in tolerable strain without the risk of VILI. Prone positioning should be used only as a rescue maneuver, as the lung conditions are "too good" for the prone position effectiveness, which is based on improved stress and strain redistribution.4.
