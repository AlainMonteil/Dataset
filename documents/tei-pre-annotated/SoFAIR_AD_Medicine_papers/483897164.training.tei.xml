        <p>OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of therapeutic heparin compared with prophylactic heparin among moderately ill patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital wards. DESIGN Randomised controlled, adaptive, open label clinical trial.</p>
        <p>Therapeutic dose or prophylactic dose heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin), to be continued until hospital discharge, day 28, or death.</p>
        <p>The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit, assessed up to 28 days. The secondary outcomes included all cause death, the composite of all cause death or any mechanical ventilation, and venous thromboembolism. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. Outcomes were blindly adjudicated.</p>
        <p>The mean age of participants was 60 years; 264 (56.8%) were men and the mean body mass index was 30.3 kg/m 2 . At 28 days, the primary composite outcome had occurred in 37/228 patients (16.2%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 52/237 (21.9%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.10; P=0.12). Deaths occurred in four patients (1.8%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 18 patients (7.6%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.22, 0.07 to 0.65; P=0.006). The composite of all cause death or any mechanical ventilation occurred in 23 patients (10.1%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 38 (16.0%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.59, 0.34 to 1.02; P=0.06). Venous thromboembolism occurred in two patients (0.9%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and six (2.5%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.34, 0.07 to 1.71; P=0. 19). Major bleeding occurred in two patients (0.9%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and four (1.7%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.52, 0.09 to 2.85; P=0.69).</p>
        <p>In moderately ill patients with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels admitted to hospital wards, therapeutic heparin was not significantly associated with a reduction in the primary outcome but the odds of death at 28 days was decreased. The risk of major bleeding appeared low in this trial.</p>
        <p>ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04362085. doi: 10.1136/bmj.n2400 | BMJ 2021;375:n2400 | the bmj</p>
        <p>The most common cause of clinical deterioration of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 is hypoxaemic respiratory failure. 1 Pulmonary endothelial injury and microvascular thrombosis probably contribute to respiratory compromise, [2][3][4][5][6] which in turn might be caused by a thromboinflammatory state, also referred to as covid-19 coagulopathy. 2 3 7-9 Increased D-dimer levels in the blood, as a marker of coagulopathy, and hypoxaemia are associated with poor prognosis. 2 3 7-10 Heparin, in addition to its anticoagulant properties, has anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral effects and might improve endothelial function. 2 11-15 Early initiation of therapeutic heparin could therefore decrease the thrombo-inflammatory process and reduce the risk of critical illness or death. 2 4 16-18 Randomised trials indicated that anticoagulation using therapeutic heparin might be beneficial in moderately, 19 but not critically 20 ill patients with covid-19, suggesting that the time of initiation of therapeutic heparin is important. The Therapeutic Anticoagulation versus Standard Care as a Rapid Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (RAPID) trial was designed to determine if therapeutic heparin is superior to prophylactic heparin in moderately ill patients with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels admitted to hospital wards in decreasing the composite of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or death.</p>
        <p>The RAPID trial was an investigator initiated randomised controlled trial. For administrative reasons, the protocol in Brazil was registered separately, but prospectively harmonised (see supplementary file). An independent data and safety monitoring board oversaw the trial (see supplementary file).</p>
        <p>The RAPID trial was an investigator initiated, parallel, pragmatic, adaptive multicentre, open label randomised controlled trial conducted at 28 hospitals in six countries. Its design has been described previously and the study protocol and statistical analysis plan are provided in the supplementary file. 21 The trial evaluates the effects of therapeutic heparin compared with prophylactic heparin in moderately ill patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital.</p>
        <p>Patients were eligible if they were moderately ill and admitted to hospital wards for covid-19 with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and had increased D-dimer levels within the first five days of admission. Moderate illness was defined as admission to hospital ward level of care (ie, not to ICU), not already mechanically ventilated, and not imminently requiring mechanical ventilation or critical care. D-dimer levels were required to be above the upper limit of normal of the local hospital in the presence of an oxygen saturation ≤93% on room air, or ≥2 times the upper limit of normal irrespective of oxygen saturation. Participants were excluded if they had substantial bleeding risks, an absolute indication for or any contraindication to heparin anticoagulation based on care team judgment, were pregnant, or if they had already experienced, or would imminently experience any component of the primary outcome (all cause death, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission). Full eligibility criteria are provided in the supplementary file. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives.</p>
        <p>We used web based central randomisation with a computer generated random sequence of variable block sizes stratified by site and age (≤65 v &gt;65 years) to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio to therapeutic heparin or prophylactic heparin. Throughout the paper heparin refers to either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin-both forms of heparin are within the same drug class and exert their anticoagulant effect by amplifying the activity of the coagulation inhibitor antithrombin. They both also have similar non-anticoagulant effects. 22 Patients allocated to therapeutic heparin received therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin as used for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. 23 was administered using a weight based nomogram (bolus plus continuous infusion) with activated partial thromboplastin time or unfractionated heparin anti-Xa titration according to the centre specific protocols (that is, high dose nomogram). Patients allocated to prophylactic heparin received dose capped prophylactic subcutaneous heparin (low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin) adjusted for body mass index and creatinine clearance (see supplementary file for dosing). Prophylactic doses of heparin were thus restricted to evidence based protocols for the prevention of venous thromboembolism for medical patients admitted to hospital. 24 Study treatment was started within 24 hours after randomisation and continued until the first of hospital discharge, day 28, study withdrawal, or death (supplementary fig S1). If a participant was admitted to ICU, continuation of the allocated treatment was recommended.</p>
        <p>The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission, non-invasive (bilevel or continuous positive airway pressure) or invasive mechanical ventilation, or death up to 28 days. Secondary outcomes included all cause death; the composite of any mechanical ventilation or all cause death; ICU admission or all cause death; ventilator-free days alive; organ support-free days alive; ICU-free days alive; hospitalfree days alive; renal replacement therapy; venous thromboembolism; arterial thromboembolism; and D-dimer level from blood samples taken at two days ±24 hours post-randomisation (see the supplementary file for detailed definitions). The following components of the primary composite were not included in the protocol but were prespecified as secondary outcomes in the statistical analysis plan: invasive mechanical ventilation; composite of invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation; and ICU admission. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 25 red blood cell transfusion (≥1 unit), transfusion of haemostatic blood components or products, and heparin induced thrombocytopenia. If a patient reached any defined clinical endpoint (that is, component of primary outcome or secondary outcome), other than events that required a change to clinical care, such as thromboembolism or bleeding, the protocol suggested ongoing treatment per allocated arm but left ultimate decisions about heparin anticoagulation to the discretion of the treating doctors. An independent event adjudication committee, which was unaware of treatment assignments, adjudicated the components of the primary outcome, bleeding, thrombotic events, and cause of death. The event adjudication was not prespecified in the protocol.</p>
        <p>We estimated that 231 patients in each group would provide 90% power to detect a 15% absolute risk difference, from 50% in the control group to 35% in the experimental group, at a two sided α level of 0.048 accounting for two planned interim analyses at 25% and 75% of the originally planned sample size. 2 16 21 At 75%, we performed a conditional power analysis. The protocol prespecified that the sample size would be increased if the conditional power was between 60% and 80%. 21 As the conditional power was below 60%, the data safety and monitoring board recommended not to increase the sample size and complete recruitment as originally planned.</p>
        <p>The primary analysis of the primary composite outcome was based on the intention-to-treat principle using logistic regression; a χ 2 test of independence was conducted to obtain a two sided P value. 26 Participants who did not have a 28 day assessment but were discharged from hospital alive before day 28, were assumed to be event-free up to day 28. Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome accompanied by tests of interaction were done for age, sex, body mass index, time from onset of covid-19 symptoms, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, race or ethnicity, D-dimer level, use of systemic corticosteroids, and geographical region. Post hoc subgroup analyses were repeated for all cause death. Prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome excluded participants who did not have a 28 day assessment and included only participants from the per protocol cohort. The per protocol cohort included all eligible participants who received their intervention as randomly allocated during the first 48 hours after randomisation, and excluded participants who did not satisfy all eligibility criteria, did not receive their allocated treatment, or did not have follow-up until day 28, death, or occurrence of a primary composite outcome component. Since randomisation was stratified by age, an additional logistic regression model was fit to analyse the primary outcome controlling for age.</p>
        <p>Binary secondary outcomes were analysed using logistic regression. Ventilator-free days, organ supportfree days, ICU-free days, and hospital-free days alive were analysed using ordinal logistic regression; death up to 28 days was assigned the worst outcome (a value of -1) in these analyses. 27 We compared the post-treatment D-dimer level using linear regression adjusted for baseline. Since D-dimer assays differed across sites, D-dimer levels were expressed as multiples of the local laboratory assay upper limit of normal (D-dimer×upper limit of normal)-that is, the ratio of D-dimer values divided by the local upper limit of normal, and analysed as natural logarithm of this ratio: log(D-dimer/upper limit of normal). Analyses of secondary outcomes were considered exploratory so were not adjusted for multiple comparisons; the widths of 95% confidence intervals for secondary outcomes should not be used for inferences about treatment effects. The supplementary file provides an extended description of the statistical methods.</p>
        <p>setting the research question and in developing plans for recruitment, design, and implementation of the results of this study.</p>
        <p>From 29 May 2020 to 12 April 2021, a total of 3975 patients were screened and 465 included in the study: 228 were randomly assigned to therapeutic heparin and 237 to prophylactic heparin. Overall, 224 (98.2%) in the therapeutic heparin group and 234 (98.7%) in the prophylactic heparin group received treatment as allocated within 24 hours after randomisation, and 222 (97.4%) and 232 (97.9%), respectively, continued to receive treatment as allocated up to 48 hours after randomisation (fig 1). The final follow-up date for the 28 day primary outcome was 10 May 2021.</p>
        <p>The mean age of participants was 60 years; 264 (56.8%) were men and the mean body mass index was 30.3. Baseline D-dimer level was 2.3-fold above the upper limit of normal, and mean creatinine was 85.2 µmol/L. At baseline, six patients in the therapeutic heparin group and five in the prophylactic heparin group had D-dimer levels below the upper limit of normal. Baseline personal and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment arms (table 1, and supplementary tables S1-2). The mean duration from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7.1 days, and the mean duration from hospital admission to randomisation was 1.4 days. The mean treatment duration was 6.5 in the therapeutic heparin group and 6.3 days in the prophylactic heparin group (supplementary table S3). One patient in the therapeutic heparin group was admitted to hospital for more than 28 days post-randomisation compared with none in the prophylactic heparin group. Low molecular weight heparin was prescribed in 224 (98.2%) patients assigned to therapeutic heparin and 222 (93.7%) assigned to prophylactic heparin. Concomitant treatments (systemic corticosteroids, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were balanced between treatment arms for pre-randomisation and post-randomisation periods combined (supplementary table S4).</p>
        <p>The primary outcome occurred in 37 patients ( Differences in all cause death in favour of therapeutic heparin, however, emerged early during the first week of follow-up and continued to be apparent up to 28 days (supplementary fig S3).</p>
        <p>The mean number of ventilator-free days was 26.5 (standard deviation 5.6) in the therapeutic heparin group and 24.7 (SD 8.5) in the prophylactic heparin group (odds ratio from ordinal logistic regression 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 3.08; P=0.042). The mean number of organ support-free days was 25.8 (SD 6.2) in the therapeutic heparin group and 24.1 (SD 8.8) in the prophylactic heparin group (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 2.21; P=0.13). The mean number of ICU-free days was 26.0 (SD 6.1) in the therapeutic heparin group and 24.2 (SD 8.8) in the prophylactic heparin group (1.51, 0.94 to 2.41; P=0.087). No relevant between group difference in hospital-free days was found (table 2).</p>
        <p>Venous thromboembolism occurred in two patients (0.9%) in the therapeutic heparin group and six (2.5%) in the prophylactic heparin group (0.34, 0.07 to 1.71; P=0.19; table 2 and supplementary table S7). No fatal thromboembolic events occurred. D-dimer levels, assessed a median of 1.5 days (interquartile range 1-2 days) after randomisation in 162 patients (71.1%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 173 (73.0%) assigned to prophylactic heparin, were lower in the therapeutic heparin group (geometric mean ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.99; P=0.03).</p>
        <p>Major bleeding events occurred in two patients (0.9%) in the therapeutic heparin group and four (1.7%) in the prophylactic heparin group (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.85; P=0.69, table 2). No fatal bleeding events or cases of intracranial haemorrhage occurred (supplementary tables S8 and S9).</p>
        <p>Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary outcome and post hoc subgroup analyses of all cause death did not provide evidence for differences in treatment effect between subgroups (fig 2 and supplementary fig S6). Findings from the per protocol analyses and other sensitivity analyses, including an intention-totreat analysis of the primary outcome with time-bytreatment interaction, were similar to those from the primary analysis (supplementary tables S10-S17).</p>
        <p>In this randomised trial of moderately ill patients with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels admitted to hospital wards, therapeutic heparin was not associated with a significantly lower incidence of the primary composite of death, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission compared with prophylactic heparin. The odds of all cause death in the group allocated to therapeutic heparin was, however, significantly reduced by 78%. Between group differences were smaller and non-significant for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.</p>
        <p>The mortality reduction was more pronounced in RAPID than in a multiplatform trial of moderately ill patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, integrating the Antithrombotic Therapy to Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 (ATTACC), Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines-4 Antithrombotics Inpatient Platform Trial (ACTIV-4a), and the Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP). 19 Potential explanations include chance and a stronger contrast between treatment arms in RAPID compared with the multiplatform trial. 19 28 The multiplatform trial allowed intermediate dose heparin in the control group, and 28.3% of participants received higher than prophylactic doses. 19 In addition, 20.4% participants in the experimental group received lower than therapeutic heparin doses. 19 RAPID only allowed prophylactic heparin doses in the control group, and only 1.7% of participants received higher doses with no clear clinical indication. Similarly, only 2.6% received lower than therapeutic heparin doses in the experimental group (supplementary tables S18 and S19). It is unlikely that the difference in eligibility criteria for increased D-dimer levels between RAPID and the multiplatform trial account for the larger reduction in deaths in RAPID. The multiplatform trial did not find a treatment-by-subgroup interaction for any of the outcomes, including all cause death, when distinguishing between patients who were D-dimer positive, D-dimer negative, or had unknown D-dimer levels. 19 Both trials excluded patients at higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis, and those who were receiving mechanical ventilation at screening. 21 29 The effectiveness of anticoagulation seems to depend on the type of anticoagulant: the Anticoagulation on 10 February 2022 at Radboud University. Protected by copyright. http://www.bmj.com/ BMJ: first published as 10.1136/bmj.n2400 on 14 October 2021. Downloaded from Coronavirus (ACTION) trial used 15-20 mg of rivaroxaban in 94% of patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation, and found no benefit. 30 Rivaroxaban is unlikely to have the anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties attributed to heparin. 2 11-15 In addition, ACTION allowed intermediate doses of enoxaparin in the control group. Nevertheless, given variation in findings from published trials, prospective metaanalyses will be important to determine the effects of different types and doses of anticoagulants in different patient subgroups. 31 32 The trial was conducted during a 12 month period between May 2020 and May 2021. During this time, management strategies for covid-19 have evolved, which in turn could have influenced the effect of therapeutic heparin on clinical outcomes. However, we found no time-by-treatment interaction in a sensitivity analysis (supplementary table S15). In RAPID and the multiplatform trials, lower rates of major bleeding compared with those in cohort studies were observed, suggesting that investigators were able to exclude patients with higher risks of bleeding. 19 20 A numerical increase in bleeding risk with prophylactic heparin in this trial is most probably a chance finding; 95% confidence intervals are wide and compatible with the increased risk of bleeding associated with therapeutic heparin in the multiplatform trial by Lawler et al. 19 In fact, one of the patients in the prophylactic heparin group experienced a major bleed after hospital discharge while not receiving any form of anticoagulation. The event was reported, as it occurred within the 28 day observation period. The reason for low venous thromboembolic events in this and other trials is unclear (2.2% overall in RAPID, 1.9% in the multiplatform trial in moderately ill patients, 19 4.7% in ACTION), 30 but could reflect eligibility criteria or improvements in therapies addressing inflammatory and thrombotic processes, compared with earlier studies. 17 19 30 33 Limitations of this study Our trial has several limitations. RAPID had an adaptive design. The protocol prespecified that the sample size would be increased if the conditional power at 75% of the original sample size was between 60% and 80%. 21 The conditional power was, however, below 60%, therefore the sample size was not increased and RAPID remained underpowered for the analysis of the primary outcome. Despite encouraging early observational data from Wuhan, China, 2 we did not consider all cause death as a primary outcome, as the sample size required Given the potential for overburdening resource limited healthcare systems during the pandemic, it was not considered feasible to conduct a double blind trial. However, ICU admission and non-invasive mechanical ventilation as components of the primary composite outcome might have been too subjective and open to performance bias or random variation. Performance bias 36 could have occurred if clinicians had been influenced in their decision to admit patients to ICU or treat them with non-invasive mechanical ventilation by their knowledge of the allocated treatment; random variation could have been caused by the pandemic's variable impact on hospital resources over time and across regions. Detection bias 36 could have occurred if investigation or reporting of potential events (especially incidental deep vein thromboses) in patients receiving therapeutic heparin was less likely than events in patients receiving prophylactic heparin. The converse could have been true for bleeding events. Biased reporting is unlikely to have occurred for the components of the primary outcome as admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation are unambiguously supported by medical source documents and all cause death is objective. Also, an independent clinical events committee blindly adjudicated all relevant outcomes. As in other anticoagulation trials in patients with covid-19, 19 20 30 37 many screened patients were not deemed eligible or did not consent to participate. Our findings might therefore not be generalisable to all moderately ill patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital wards.</p>
        <p>The RAPID trial did not find a significant reduction in the primary composite outcome of death, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission with therapeutic heparin. However, therapeutic heparin was associated with a substantially decreased odds of all cause death and low risk of major bleeding. In conjunction with the recently published multiplatform trial, 19 the RAPID trial therefore suggests that therapeutic heparin is beneficial in moderately ill patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital wards.</p>
