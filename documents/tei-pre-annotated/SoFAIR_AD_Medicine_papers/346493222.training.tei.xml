        <p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents an emergent global threat which is straining worldwide healthcare capacity. As of May 27th, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has resulted in more than 340,000 deaths worldwide, with 100,000 deaths in the US alone. It is imperative to study and develop pharmacological treatments suitable for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Ascorbic acid is a crucial vitamin necessary for the correct functioning of the immune system. It plays a role in stress response and has shown promising results when administered to the critically ill. Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in numerous studies. There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions which have a sound biological rationale should be prioritized for experimental use in the current context of a global health pandemic. We present the current evidence for the use of vitamin C and quercetin both for prophylaxis in high-risk populations and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as an adjunct to promising pharmacological agents such as Remdesivir or convalescent plasma.Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents an emergent global threat which is straining worldwide healthcare capacity.

        <p>It is serendipitous (or perhaps indicative of hard work) that the Nobel prize winner Szent-Gyorgyi discovered both ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and the flavonoid quercetin (at the time labeled vitamin P) (1).

        <p>Vitamin C exerts its antiviral properties by supporting lymphocyte activity, increasing interferon-α production, modulating cytokines, reducing inflammation, improving endothelial dysfunction, and restoring mitochondrial function (4)(5)(6). There are also suggestions that vitamin C may be directly viricidal (7). These in vitro effects, as we previously discussed (2), constitute a reflection of both the supra-physiological concentrations of ascorbate and the interaction between vitamin C and metal-containing culture media-both of which are pro-oxidant, generating reactive oxygen species.Vitamin C exerts its antiviral properties by supporting lymphocyte activity, increasing interferon-α production, modulating cytokines, reducing inflammation, improving endothelial dysfunction, and restoring mitochondrial function (4)(5)(6).

        <p>Quercetin (also known as 3,3 ′ ,4 ′ 5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a widely distributed plant flavonoid, found in several vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains, where it is conjugated with residual sugars to form quercetin glycosides (8). Studies suggest that quercetin supplementation may promote antioxidant (9), antiinflammatory, antiviral (10), and immunoprotective effects (11). Quercetin has been studied in various types and models of viral infection due to its promising antiviral effects in inhibiting polymerases (12), proteases (13), reverse transcriptase (14), suppressing DNA gyrase, and binding viral capsid proteins (15,16).Quercetin (also known as 3,3 ′ ,4 ′ 5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a widely distributed plant flavonoid, found in several vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains, where it is conjugated with residual sugars to form quercetin glycosides (8).

        <p>In this review we collate the evidence of the antiviral properties of quercetin, describe its biologic action and pharmacokinetics profile, expand on our previous review of vitamin C, discuss their synergistic actions, and propose this experimental multi-drug approach for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic.In this review we collate the evidence of the antiviral properties of quercetin, describe its biologic action and pharmacokinetics profile, expand on our previous review of vitamin C, discuss their synergistic actions, and propose this experimental multi-drug approach for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>In plants, quercetin is produced from the phenylpropanoid pathway and is ultimately derived from phenylalanine. It is converted to 4-coumaroyl-CoA, via phenylalanine ammonialysate, to cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumaroyl-CoA-ligase. This is combined with malonyl-CoA in a 1:3 ratio by 7,2 ′dihydroxy-4 ′ methoxyisoflavanol synthase to form tetrahydroxy chalcone. This in turn is converted to naringenin and to eriodyctiol through flavonoid 3 ′ -hydroxylase. Finally, eriodyctiol is hydroxylated and converted to quercetin (Figure 1) using flavanol synthase (17).In plants, quercetin is produced from the phenylpropanoid pathway and is ultimately derived from phenylalanine.

        <p>Flavonoid compounds, such as quercetin, were initially studied for their biological activity in affecting capillary wall resistance (19) and continue to be investigated for their effects on vascular tension (20). Dietary supplements differ, but often contain the free form of quercetin-quercetin aglycone-under the FDA national drug code numbers 65448-3085, 65448-3005 (21). Once consumed, quercetin passes predominantly unaltered into the large intestine (22). Quercetin acts as a free radical scavenger, donating two electrons via o-quinone/quinone methide (23); both in vitro and in vivo (24,25) studies implicate quercetin as a potent antioxidant. This antioxidant activity may also be potentiated by vitamin C (26), as will be discussed below. There is also significant longstanding interest in the antiinflammatory activity of quercetin, as it has been suggested to be a key mediator in the cardiovascular protective element of the "Mediterranean" diet (27). This biological rationale is secondary to quercetin's free radical scavenging capacity, alongside diverse roles identified in in vitro and in vivo models including: inhibition of platelet aggregation (28), inhibition of lipid peroxidation (29), and its inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory mediators such as lipoxygenase (30) and phospholipase A2 (31). This anti-inflammatory effect is primarily mediated by flavonoid activity on arachidonic acid metabolism and the associated leukotriene/prostaglandin pathways. Furthermore, 3-methylquercetin, a quercetin metabolite, displays stimulatory effects on nasal epithelial cell ciliary beat frequency, both in vitro and in vivo, when administered either alone or with absorption enhancer HP-β-CD (32). Quercetin also affects the function of several lipids, protein tyrosine, and serine/threonine kinases (33,34), such as phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) (35,36).Flavonoid compounds, such as quercetin, were initially studied for their biological activity in affecting capillary wall resistance (19) and continue to be investigated for their effects on vascular tension (20).

        <p>There is a tremendous amount of literature supporting the antiviral properties of quercetin, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Quercetin inhibits several respiratory viruses in cultured cells (16,37). It inhibits the cytopathic effects provoked by many serotypes of rhinovirus, echovirus (type 7, 11, 12, and 19), coxsackievirus (A21 and B1), and poliovirus (type 1 Sabin) at a minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.03 to 0.5 µg/ml in Hela or WI-38 cells (38). Quercetin also significantly reduces plaque formation by RNA and DNA viruses [Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Polio type 1, parainfluenza type 3, and Herpes Simplex Virus-1(HSV-1)] displaying anti-infective and anti-replicative properties (39). It inhibits the replication of cytomegalovirus (CMV) inoculated HeLa cells at a half inhibitory concentration OH OH HO 0 OH (IC50) of 3.2 ± 0.8 µM and with a selectivity index (SI) of 22 (40). Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) replication in Vero cells is inhibited by quercetin at an IC50 of 35.7 µg/mL, causing a DENV-2 RNA reduction of 67%. This is attributed to quercetin's ability to either block virus entry or inhibit viral replication enzymes such as viral polymerases (41).There is a tremendous amount of literature supporting the antiviral properties of quercetin, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

        <p>In vivo studies indicate that mice inoculated with meningoencephalitis virus are protected from lethal infection by quercetin (30 or 40 mg/Kg BID, po, for 4 days) in a dose dependent manner (42). These beneficial effects are abolished if the compound is administered for &lt;3 days, once per day or via subcutaneous injection. This may suggest that the antiviral effects may be dependent on a minimum inhibitory concentration or from some form of metabolic drug conversion (42). Quercetin treatment also displayed a beneficial effect in immunocompetent mice infected with Mengo virus, where it lessened the severity of organ damage (43). Athletes supplemented with quercetin are protected from stress-induced susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infection (44)-which was not related to immunomodulation (45,46).In vivo studies indicate that mice inoculated with meningoencephalitis virus are protected from lethal infection by quercetin (30 or 40 mg/Kg BID, po, for 4 days) in a dose dependent manner (42).

        <p>Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in a diverse array of immune functions; its supplementation has demonstrated beneficial effects in different types of viral infections. Reduced levels of ascorbate have been found in patients with viral infections (47), sepsis (48), sepsis-related ARDS (49), and other critical illness (50). During infection, vitamin C is necessary for neutrophil killing (51), is concentrated within macrophages (52), is responsible of T cell maturation (53), and promotes phagocytosis and apoptosis of spent neutrophils (4). It is not surprising, therefore, that viral infections, depending on their severity, are associated with an increased metabolism and reduced circulating ascorbate.Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in a diverse array of immune functions; its supplementation has demonstrated beneficial effects in different types of viral infections.

        <p>Vitamin C has improved survival in different murine models of lethal infection. Mice infected with Venezuelan encephalitis virus and treated with vitamin C (50 mg/kg) exhibit half the mortality of controls with associated reductions in viral titers, lipid peroxidation products, and NO content (54). Mice incapable of synthetizing vitamin C (L-Gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase nulls) were infected with influenza; mice not receiving supplemental vitamin C exhibited greater lung pathology scores despite no differences in viral titers (55). In restraint-stressed mice with H1N1 viral-induced pneumonia, vitamin C reduced mortality dose-dependently (100% vs. 80% vs. 50% at 0, 125, and 250 mg/kg/day) and reduced capillary-alveolar structural damage (56). Mice inoculated with Rabies+ mouse brain cells and treated with daily 100 mg/kg IM vitamin C exhibited nearly half the mortality of controls (57).Vitamin C has improved survival in different murine models of lethal infection.

        <p>Vitamin C administration (i.v. 5 g/day twice/week) in patients with herpes zoster exhibited a lower incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (31.1% vs. 57.1%) and at study end (week 16) there was a lower pain score in the treatment group (0.64+/-0.9 vs. 1.98 +/-0.7) (59). Vitamin C administered at 1 g BID to 133 patients, reduced the risk (OR 0.25) of herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) recurrence ( 60), in accordance with previous studies indicating reduced ascorbate availability in the eye (61). It is noteworthy that a growing number of case reports of virusrelated acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS) indicate successful treatment with intravenous high doses of Vitamin C (62,63).Vitamin C administration (i.v. 5 g/day twice/week) in patients with herpes zoster exhibited a lower incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (31.1% vs. 57.1%) and at study end (week 16) there was a lower pain score in the treatment group (0.64+/-0.9 vs. 1.98 +/-0.7) (59).

        <p>Cell entry is a crucial step during viral infection and has been studied as a potential target of antiviral treatments (66)(67)(68). In an in vitro model of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza infection of MDCK cells, quercetin demonstrated reduced cytopathic effect 48 h post-infection (69). This effect was observed when quercetin was administered during viral entry (0-2 h), was maximal with quercetin pretreatment, and was dependent on quercetin's ability to bind hemagglutinin proteins (HA). Specifically, quercetin bound (dose-dependently) the HA subunit responsible for membrane fusion during virus entry and virus-mediated hemolysis (69). In vitro, quercetin pre-treatment (10 µM) inhibited Rhinovirus (RV) virulence, entry, and replication into BEAS-2B cells via multiple mechanisms: it impeded RV endocytosis though misdirecting EEA1 localization -an early endosomal marker-and inhibiting AKT phosphorylation with subsequent 3-fold viral load reduction at 24 h, lowering negative-strand RNA and modulating interferon (IFN) and IL-8 expression (70). These results were confirmed in vivo, with an estimated lower plasmatic concentration of quercetin (nM) (similarly to other studies (71-73)) during which quercetin reduced RV-RNA at 1 day post-infection, modulated KC, MIP-2, TNF-a, and MCP-2, decreased virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, and modulated IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-λ2) (70).Cell entry is a crucial step during viral infection and has been studied as a potential target of antiviral treatments (66)(67)(68).

        <p>The in vitro antiviral effects of quercetin on herpesviruses (HSV-1, 2) and adenoviruses (ADV-3,-8,-11) suggest inhibition of early stage viral replication in a dose dependent manner (for HSV-1 100% inhibition at 60 mg/L) (16,74), as well as inhibition of viral DNA and RNA polymerase (12,75,76). In human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), inoculated with polio, 3-methyl-quercetin disrupted plaque formation while quercetin itself demonstrated these effects when administered together with vitamin C (77). In fact, Vitamin C (either Dor L-ascorbate but not dehydroascorbate), prevented quercetin spontaneous degradation suggesting necessary co-administration with ascorbate to exert its antiviral effect. The beneficial effects of 3-methyl-quercetin (10 µM) were exerted primarily when the compound was administered 1-2 h post-poliovirus infection in Hela cells, inhibiting viral proteins and RNA synthesis in a dose dependent manner (78). In fact, 3-methyl-quercetin was identified as a molecule able to bind essential proteins required during the transcription from minus-strand RNA into positive polarity RNAs, thus interfering with cytoplasmic viral RNA replication (79).The in vitro antiviral effects of quercetin on herpesviruses (HSV-1, 2) and adenoviruses (ADV-3,-8,-11) suggest inhibition of early stage viral replication in a dose dependent manner (for HSV-1 100% inhibition at 60 mg/L) (16,74), as well as inhibition of viral DNA and RNA polymerase (12,75,76).

        <p>In an in vivo study, a quercetin metabolite (4 ′ ,5-diacetyl-3,Y,7-trimethyl-quercetin), administered orally BID for 4 days protected mice against lethal infection by Coxsackie virus, promoting survival in a dose-response scale: 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg increased survival by 30, 40, and 50%, respectively (38).

        <p>Quercetin has been investigated in vitro as an antiviral agent for HIV due to its ability to inhibit crucial enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) (80). Quercetin significantly reduces HIV viral replication (81) and, when added to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNc) infected with HIV and compared to HIV infected controls, quercetin reduced the levels of p24, Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) gene expression, and viral infectivity together with an inhibition of TNF-α and upregulation of IL-13 (11).Quercetin has been investigated in vitro as an antiviral agent for HIV due to its ability to inhibit crucial enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN), and protease (PR) (80).

        <p>Quercetin has also been shown to inhibit non-HIV RT activity in vitro, including avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT), Rous-associated virus-2 (RAV-2-RT), and Maloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV-RT). Quercetin displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory action: at 50 µM, 23% inhibition of both AMV-RT and RAV-2-RT, and at 10 µM inhibition of mammalian MMLV-RT of almost 60% were reached (14). HIV-RT was inhibited completely at 2 µg/ml quercetin in a partiallycompetitive mode (76). These antiviral effects of quercetin are believed to be related to the five hydroxyl groups on 3, 3 ′ , 4 ′ , 5, and 7 as the inhibitory activity is lower for baicalein, quercetagetin, or luteolin which lack these groups (75).Quercetin has also been shown to inhibit non-HIV RT activity in vitro, including avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (AMV-RT), Rous-associated virus-2 (RAV-2-RT), and Maloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV-RT).

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 serine protease catalytic activity was directly inhibited by quercetin treatment in a dose dependent manner (95% NS3 inhibition at 1.25 mg/ml); in this study quercetin blocked virus RNA production and impeded virus replication by 70% at 72 h without affecting cell viability (13).Quercetin is a potent HIV protease inhibitor in vitro, with an IC50 of 58.8 µM (83).

        <p>Quercetin treatment inhibits HCV replication (84). This effect is attributed to its ability to modulate Heat Shock Protein expression (HSPs), thus impeding the crucial binding between heat shock factor and elements (HSF-HSE) necessary for the stress-induced transcription of stress genes (85,86). Quercetin reduced HSP70 and HSP40, thereby impeding the formation of Non-Structural protein 5A complexes (NS5A-HSP70 and NS5A-HSP40) necessary for HCV genome replication apparatus through the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Despite unaltered HCV titer, the production of infectious particles was decreased, interestingly more by quercetin treatment than by HSP knockdown, displaying a dose-dependent relationship: at 0.5 µM quercetin reduced viral production by 29%, at 5 µM by 90%, and at 50 µM by nearly 100% (84).Quercetin treatment inhibits HCV replication (84).

This effect was not dependent on a sustained ASC-2P presence but was abolished if the ASC2-P was added after the virus infection, indicating an immunomodulatory effect, rather than directly antiviral.

        <p>Patients with acute Epstein-Barr infection (EBV) treated with high doses of intravenous vitamin C (7.5-50 g) displayed lower EBV-IgG (levels, while EBV VCA IgM antibody levels were negatively correlated to increasing plasma ascorbate concentration (91). Patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis HAM/TSP were all successfully treated with 35-40 mg/kg oral vitamin C for 3-5 days despite no changes in serum HTLV-1 or CSF HTLV-1 antibody titer, indicating an immunomodulative effect (92). Of these patients, 4 underwent a vitamin C on-off study which demonstrated a "positive dose response relationship with neurological symptoms." A separate prospective trial into a diverse number of therapies indicated that vitamin C improved motor disability grades in HAM/TSP in 20% of patients (93).

        <p>Vitamin C administration has been related to enhanced interferon production and was studied for its possible use for the prevention of vaccine failure. Rabies vaccination, when supplemented with 2 g oral vitamin C for each of the 3 injections provoked, at 24 h, increased serum IFN-α levels, indicating that "vitamin C is an effective stimulator of interferon production" (94). Mice on an ad libitum diet containing vitamin C increased induction of interferon (62-145%) depending on the viral titer of inoculation (95), and L-ascorbate added to stimulated mouse cell lines increases interferon synthesis (96). Low levels of vitamin C, in fact, have been related to insufficient phosphorylation of signal transducers and activation of transcription (STATs), which represent a crucial signaling process of IFNs (97). Specifically, T cells of mice deficient in vitamin C display defects in STAT3 phosphorylation (90).Vitamin C administration has been related to enhanced interferon production and was studied for its possible use for the prevention of vaccine failure.

        <p>Quercetin has been investigated for its possible antiviral effect on several members of the Coronaviridae family and, as mentioned by Ling Yi and colleagues, "quercetin offers great promise as a potential drug in the clinical treatment of SARS" (98). SARS-Coronavirus, described in 2003 (99), is a single-stranded RNA virus of ∼29,700 nucleotides, which uses ribosome sites to encode two replicase glycoproteins, PP1a and PP1b, that mediate viral replication (99,100). Once these precursor glycoproteins are synthesized, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) plays a critical role in the lytic release of its replicates (101). Quercetin-3β-galactoside binds SARS-Cov 3CL protease and inhibits its proteolytic activity with an IC50 of 42.79 ± 4.95 µM (102). This inhibitory action on 3CLpro is dependent on the hydroxyl group of quercetin which, as shown through molecular modeling and Q189A mutation, recognizes Gln189 as a crucial site on 3CLpro responsible for the binding of quercetin (102). Quercetin was also identified as a compound able to block SARS-Coronavirus entry into Vero E6 cells with a half-effective concentration (EC50) of 83.4 µM and with low cytotoxicity (CC50 3.32 mM) (98).Quercetin has been investigated for its possible antiviral effect on several members of the Coronaviridae family and, as mentioned by Ling Yi and colleagues, "quercetin offers great promise as a potential drug in the clinical treatment of SARS" (98).

        <p>Orally administered quercetin glycosides are hydroxylated by βglucosidases in the gut (107,108). Aglycone quercetin passively permeate the intestinal epithelial barrier while quercetin glycosides are absorbed via the intestinal sodium/glucose cotransporter-1 (109). The bioavailability of oral quercetin is extremely variable, achieving values from 0 to 50% (110). Quercetin can be metabolized either in the enterocytes or in the hepatocytes forming glucuronidated, sulfated, or/and methylated compounds (111). Indeed, four out of five hydroxyl groups of quercetin can be glucuronidated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, forming its major metabolites: quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide, and quercetin-3'-sulfate (112). Rat tissue distribution of orally, long-term administered quercetin (12 weeks) shows the highest concentration in the lungs while pigs display the highest concentrations in the liver and kidneys (113). In contrast, short-term administration exhibits no marked distribution, implying that the beneficial effects of quercetin in preventing lung respiratory viral infection could be maximized by long-term administration. Following 500 mg oral quercetin, maximum plasma concentration of ∼15 µg/L of aglycone quercetin (∼50 nM, T max of 3 h) and 450 µg/L of quercetin non-methylated conjugates (T max of 4 h) were found (114).

        <p>Quercetin spontaneously oxidizes to form O-semiquinone and O-quinone/quinone methide (QQ), which can bind protein thiols forming toxic compounds (118). This process of both anti-and pro-oxidant effects has been named the "quercetin paradox" (119). However, QQ can be recycled into quercetin by electron donors like NADH or ascorbate, or form together, with glutathione either 6-glutathionyl-quercetin or 8-glutathionylquercetin (GSQs) (107,120). Importantly, if ascorbate or glutathione levels are insufficient, quercetin may be shunted to QQ and exert prooxidant effects. Therefore, we stress the importance for its co-administration with vitamin C (121,122). However, even though QQ exhibits a higher affinity for glutathione than for vitamin C (121), the methylated metabolites of quercetin show a higher preference for ascorbate than for thiols, suggesting a cycling of activity which will exert anti-oxidant effects (Figure 2) (123). Furthermore, both GSQs (124) and QQ-protein thiols have been shown to be unstable and transient -lasting for minutes and hours instead of days-suggesting an overestimation of the proposed in vitro toxicity (125).Quercetin spontaneously oxidizes to form O-semiquinone and O-quinone/quinone methide (QQ), which can bind protein thiols forming toxic compounds (118).

        <p>A multi-drug approach with quercetin and vitamin C may disrupt virus entry, replication, enzyme activity and assembly, and concurrently fortify the immune response promoting early IFNs production, modulating interleukins, promoting T cell maturation, and phagocytic activity. Quercetin and ascorbic acid co-administration represents an experimental strategy for prophylaxis and treatment of several respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. The blockage of virus entry represents a key strategy and quercetin impedes viral membrane fusion for both influenza and SARS-Cov in vitro (98). Quercetin also targets viral polymerases and may disrupt replication via the inhibition of reverse transcriptase enzymes. Quercetin further inhibits SARS 3CL protease by binding to its GLN189 site (102), which is expressed similarly by SARS-COV-2 ( 105) and provides a direct mechanistic rationale for its experimental clinical use-in addition to its immunoenhancing and anti-inflammatory actions. Despite the limitations of in vitro research, it is noteworthy that the few in vivo models reviewed here indicate increased survival from lethal viral infection when treated with quercetin (42,64). Some studies suggest that oral administration and metabolic processing (methylation, conjugation, etc.) is necessary, and have identified quercetin derivates, which display variable T max , as responsible for a cooperative antiviral activity (126)(127)(128).A multi-drug approach with quercetin and vitamin C may disrupt virus entry, replication, enzyme activity and assembly, and concurrently fortify the immune response promoting early IFNs production, modulating interleukins, promoting T cell maturation, and phagocytic activity.

SARS-Cov-2 virus infection may initiate a strong inflammatory and dysregulated reaction in the lung with increased levels of IL-6 and a "cytokine-storm" (129) which has been shown to provoke either an asymptomatic, mild, or severe infections This cytokine dysregulation may be associated with neutrophil extracellular traps (130) and alterations in T cell activity (131).

        <p>There are potential limitations of their use in clinical studies. Both agents are present in varying degrees in individuals' diets and global recommendations for vitamin C intake vary extensively across the globe (135). Prophylactic interventions in general populations within the community will therefore be confounded by the quantity present in differing diets. Agents such as vitamin C also have well-characterized beneficial effects apart from the antiviral properties we have highlighted here. Supplementation with these agents may therefore promote general health and indirectly affect the capacity of individuals to combat viral infection. Although this would diminish the ability to identify the direct antiviral properties of vitamin C in clinical studies it may have ancillary benefits of promoting general health, which may be particularly pertinent if administered in communities with greater deprivation or from less economically developed countries.There are potential limitations of their use in clinical studies.
