        <p>During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK are activated, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP), caspase activation and cell death. However, even in the absence of caspase activity, cells usually die following MOMP. Such caspaseindependent cell death is accompanied by inflammation that requires mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) activation of cGAS-STING signalling. Because the mitochondrial inner membrane is thought to remain intact during apoptosis, we sought to address how matrix mtDNA could activate the cytosolic cGAS-STING signalling pathway. Using super-resolution imaging, we show that mtDNA is efficiently released from mitochondria following MOMP. In a temporal manner, we find that following MOMP, BAX/BAKmediated mitochondrial outer membrane pores gradually widen. This allows extrusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane into the cytosol whereupon it permeablises allowing mtDNA release. Our data demonstrate that mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilisation (MIMP) can occur during cell death following BAX/BAKdependent MOMP. Importantly, by enabling the cytosolic release of mtDNA, inner membrane permeabilisation underpins the immunogenic effects of caspase-independent cell death.During apoptosis, pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK are activated, causing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP), caspase activation and cell death.

        <p>To initiate cell death, intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptosis requires mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation, or MOMP (Tait &amp; Green, 2013). MOMP causes the release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins, including cytochrome c, that activate caspase proteases leading to apoptosis. Nevertheless, irrespective of caspase activity, cells typically do not survive following widespread MOMP, defining it as a point-of-no-return (Haraguchi et al, 2000;Ekert et al, 2004;Tait et al, 2010). Because of this central role in dictating cell fate, MOMP is tightly controlled, primarily via pro-and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family (Lopez &amp; Tait, 2015). Under homeostatic conditions, anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (e.g. BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1) block the pro-apoptotic actions of BAX and BAK. Following an apoptotic trigger, BAX and BAK are activated, leading to their oligomerisation in the mitochondrial outer membrane and MOMP (Wei et al, 2001;Cosentino &amp; Garcia-Saez, 2017).To initiate cell death, intrinsic or mitochondrial apoptosis requires mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation, or MOMP (Tait &amp; Green, 2013).

        <p>Mitochondrial apoptosis is considered a non-inflammatory form of cell death, allowing the host to quickly and efficiently clear away dead cell corpses without provoking an immune response (Arandjelovic &amp; Ravichandran, 2015). Recently, others and ourselves have shown that caspase activity is essential for the noninflammatory nature of mitochondrial apoptosis; if caspase activity is blocked following MOMP, cell death still occurs, but a type I interferon (IFN) response and NF-jB activation ensues (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017). This leads to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and an immune response towards the dying cell that can initiate anti-tumour immunity (Giampazolias et al, 2017). Therefore, as proposed by others, a main function of apoptotic caspase activity may be to silence inflammation during cell death (Martin et al, 2012).Mitochondrial apoptosis is considered a non-inflammatory form of cell death, allowing the host to quickly and efficiently clear away dead cell corpses without provoking an immune response (Arandjelovic &amp; Ravichandran, 2015).

        <p>The ability of MOMP to activate inflammation and a type I IFN response requires recognition of mtDNA by the cytosolic cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017). However, it is challenging to reconcile how matrix localised mtDNA can activate the cytosolic cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway since the mitochondrial inner membrane is thought to remain intact during apoptosis (von Ahsen et al, 2000;Waterhouse et al, 2001). Given this paradox, we set out to define how mtDNA could activate cGAS-STING signalling. Using a variety of high-resolution imaging techniques, we find that following the onset of MOMP, BAX/BAK-mediated pores widen to allow the extrusion of newly unstructured inner membrane. Under conditions of caspase inhibition, the extruded inner membrane permeabilises facilitating mtDNA release into the cytoplasm, allowing it to activate cGAS-STING signalling and IFN synthesis. Unexpectedly, our data demonstrate that the mitochondrial inner membrane can undergo permeabilisation during cell death. Importantly, by releasing mtDNA, mitochondrial inner membrane permeabilisation, or MIMP, enables cell death-associated inflammation.The ability of MOMP to activate inflammation and a type I IFN response requires recognition of mtDNA by the cytosolic cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017).

        <p>To visualise mtDNA dynamics during apoptosis, we used superresolution Airyscan confocal microscopy. Importantly, this provides sufficient resolution to allow the visualisation of the mitochondrial outer membrane and matrix-resident molecules (such as TFAM containing mtDNA nucleoids) as distinct entities under subdiffraction-limiting conditions. As expected, in healthy U2OS cells, dual immunostaining of the mitochondria outer membrane protein TOM20 and DNA revealed that mtDNA nucleoids are contained within mitochondria surrounded by a continuous outer membrane (Fig 1A). To engage mitochondrial apoptosis, U2OS cells were treated with the BH3-mimetic ABT-737, which inhibits BCL-xL, BCL-2 and BCL-w (Oltersdorf et al, 2005) together with actinomycin D (ActD, to inhibit transcription of labile MCL-1), in the presence or absence of pan-caspase inhibitor qVD-OPh. To assess cell viability, U2OS cells were imaged using IncuCyte live-cell imaging and SYTOX Green uptake or assessed for long-term clonogenic survival (Fig EV1A and B). Consistent with engagement of mitochondrial apoptosis, ABT-737/ActD co-treatment rapidly and synchronously induced cell death (Fig EV1A). Co-treatment with caspase inhibitor qVD-OPh prevented cell death in the short term (Fig EV1A) but failed to allow long-term clonogenic survival (Fig EV1B ), consistent with widespread MOMP being a point-ofno-return. Under identical MOMP-inducing conditions, U2OS cells were immunostained with anti-TOM20 and DNA antibodies to visualise mitochondrial outer membrane integrity and mtDNAcontaining nucleoids, respectively (Fig 1B). Alternatively, U2OS cells were immunostained with anti-TOM20 and cytochrome c antibodies to determine MOMP (Fig EV1C and D). Under these conditions, over 90% of U2OS cells underwent MOMP, as determined by loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c staining (Fig EV1C and D). Specifically following ABT-737/ActD treatment, under caspaseinhibited conditions, permeabilisation of the mitochondrial outer membrane was observed in over 80% of cells, as evidenced by discontinuous, crescent-like TOM20 immunostaining (Fig 1B and C). Strikingly, mtDNA displayed cytosolic re-localisation in cells that had undergone MOMP under caspase-inhibited conditions (Fig 1B). Under these conditions, over 80% of cells displayed mtDNA cytosolic release (Fig 1C) and, on average per cell, over 80% of mtDNA displayed cytosolic localisation (Fig 1D). A similar pattern of mtDNA cytosolic localisation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation was also observed in E1A/Ras transformed MEF specifically following ABT-737/ActD/qVD-OPh treatment (Fig 1E). Both cytosolic and mitochondrial mtDNA structures were of similar size, suggesting cytosolic re-localisation of mtDNAcontaining nucleoids. To determine whether mtDNA re-localisation was dependent on MOMP, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to delete BAX and BAK, two proteins essential for MOMP (Wei et al, 2001) either singly or together (Fig 1F). Only combined deletion of BAX and BAK in U2OS cells prevented MOMP and cell death following ABT-737/S63845 treatment (Figs 1G andEV1E). Under identical conditions, dual immunostaining of TOM20 and DNA demonstrated that combined deletion of BAX/BAK, but not of either alone, prevented cytosolic release of mtDNA following ABT-737/S63845/qVD-OPh treatment (Fig 1H andI).

        <p>We next investigated an association between mitochondrial mtDNA release and activation of a STING-dependent interferon response. For this purpose, we used SVEC 4-10 murine endothelial cells, which we have previously shown have an intact cGAS-STING signalling pathway (Giampazolias et al, 2017). To induce rapid mitochondrial apoptosis, SVEC cells were treated with ABT-737 together with the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845 (Kotschy et al, 2016), and cell death was monitored by SYTOX Green uptake and IncuCyte live-cell imaging (Fig 2A). Combined ABT-737/S63845 treatment led to rapid cell death that was inhibited by addition of qVD-OPh, consistent with engagement of mitochondrial apoptosis. Following 3 h of ABT-737/S63845 treatment in the presence of qVD-OPh, cells were immunostained with anti-TOM20 and DNA antibodies to visualise mitochondrial outer membrane integrity and mtDNA-containing nucleoids (Fig 2B). Similar to other cell types, mitochondrial release of mtDNA was detected. We next investigated whether a STING-dependent transcriptional interferon response was being activated under these conditions using qRT-PCR. Following engagement of caspase-independent cell death (CICD), various IFN response genes (Ifnb1, Irf7 andOasl1 ). This suggests that mtDNA can pass beyond the inner membrane during caspase-independent cell death (CICD). To investigate this further, we simultaneously imaged the MOM, IMM and mtDNA during cell death. U2OS cells stably expressing JF 646 -MOM were treated with ABT-737/ActD/qVD-OPh and then immunostained with anti-AIF and anti-DNA antibodies to detect the MOM, IMM and mtDNA, respectively.

        <p>The In the presence of caspase inhibitor, samples were immunostained for TOM20 and mtDNA, and identified as having undergone MOMP by loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c staining. 3D images were generated from Z-stacks of high-resolution images and quantified for mtDNA release (Fig 5A andB). In control samples, DRP-1-deleted cells displayed hyperfused mitochondria, as expected (Fig 5A). Importantly, the extent of mtDNA release in cells that had undergone MOMP failed to reveal a difference between wild-type and DRP-1-deficient cells (Fig 5A andB). To investigate a role for mitochondrial fission using an alternative method, we investigated whether mitochondria that have already undergone fission could release mtDNA upon MOMP. To this end, U2OS MCL-1 CRISPR cells were pre-incubated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) to induce extensive mitochondrial fission and then treated to undergo MOMP by addition of ABT-737 in the presence of qVD-OPh. Cells were immunostained for TOM20 and mtDNA, then analysed by Airyscan microscopy. As expected, CCCP treatment induced extensive mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig 5C). Importantly, induced mitochondrial fission had no effect on MOMP-induced mtDNA release, consistent with the lack of requirement for DRP-1. To further define MIMP, we adapted an assay to measure mitochondrial release of matrix calcein relative to MOMP by live-cell imaging (Bonora et al, 2016). We reasoned that should the inner membrane become permeable, Co 2+ would be free to enter the matrix and quench matrix-located calcein, enabling of detection of increased permeability in real time. To simultaneously visualise MOMP, we expressed Omi-mCherry which resides in the mitochondrial inner membrane space (Tait et al, 2010). U2OS cells loaded with calcein-AM and Co 2+ were treated with ABT-737/ ◀ Figure 3. mtDNA extrusion occurs through expanding outer membrane pores.The In the presence of caspase inhibitor, samples were immunostained for TOM20 and mtDNA, and identified as having undergone MOMP by loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c staining. 3D images were generated from Z-stacks of high-resolution images and quantified for mtDNA release (Fig 5A andB).

        <p>We next sought to understand how the inner membrane breaches the outer membrane, permitting mtDNA release. It is well established that during apoptosis BAX and BAK form oligomers on the mitochondrial outer membrane leading to MOMP (Cosentino &amp; Garcia-Saez, 2017). We therefore investigated the relationship between BAX activation, MOMP and MIMP through live-cell imaging. EV5C). These images frequently showed translocation of TFAM-mClover through the mitochondrial outer membrane at sites demarked by active BAX staining. We next investigated the inner membrane relative to BAX localisation and outer membrane opening. U2OS cells expressing JF 646 -MOM were treated with ABT-737/S63845 in the presence of qVD-OPh and immunostained for active BAX (6A7) and AIF to detect the inner membrane (Figs 6D and EV5D). Specifically following treatment, the inner membrane was found to be extruded via active BAX decorated pores. This was supported by 3D-Imaris-based analysis (Figs 6E and EV5E). These data support a model, whereby following MOMP the mitochondrial inner membrane can be extruded through BAX-mediated outer membrane pores. Once in the cytoplasm, the inner membrane can permeabilise, allowing mtDNA to activate cGAS-STING signalling.We next sought to understand how the inner membrane breaches the outer membrane, permitting mtDNA release.

        <p>Following apoptotic mitochondrial permeabilisation, mtDNA activates cGAS-STING-dependent interferon synthesis under caspaseinhibited conditions (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017). Here, we investigated how matrix localised mtDNA could activate cytosolic cGAS-STING signalling, given that their separate subcellular localisation. We find that under caspase-inhibited conditions, BAX/BAK-mediated MOMP allows extrusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane into the cytoplasm. Unexpectedly, the extruded inner membrane eventually permeabilises leading to cytosolic release of mtDNA where it can activate cGAS-STING signalling. By doing so, mitochondrial inner membrane The EMBO Journal permeabilisation or MIMP supports the immunogenic effects of caspase-independent cell death. Surprisingly, our data show that mitochondrial inner membrane can permeabilise subsequent to BAX/BAK-mediated MOMP. We found that over time, following MOMP (defined by release of Omi-mCherry), visible and widening pores appeared in the MOM through which the inner membrane is extruded (Figs 3C andD, and4). Interestingly, active BAX was found to localise at the edge of the widening MOM pores through which the inner membrane extrudes (Fig 6). This is reminiscent of recent studies showing that during apoptosis, BAX-rings border visible pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Grosse et al, 2016;Salvador-Gallego et al, 2016). Over time, we observed these MOM pores gradually widen enabling inner membrane extrusion. Coupling our data to recent findings demonstrating variation in BAX-ring size (Salvador-Gallego et al, 2016) as well as wide variation in BAX-mediated pore size (Dewson et al, 2012;Czabotar et al, 2013) strongly suggests that BAX-mediated pores are dynamic and grow over time. This is consistent with growing BAX pores previously detected during BAX-mediated liposomal permeabilisation (Bleicken et al, 2013).Following apoptotic mitochondrial permeabilisation, mtDNA activates cGAS-STING-dependent interferon synthesis under caspaseinhibited conditions (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017).

        <p>How the inner membrane eventually permeabilises remains unclear. Our data argue against any role for mitochondrial permeability transition or mitochondrial dynamics in the process. Inner membrane permeabilisation occurs considerably later (1 h) than MOMP, with less penetrance and in apparent stochastic manner (Fig 5E). As such, whether MIMP occurs in a regulated manner is unclear. Recently, McArthur, Kile and colleagues also described inner membrane permeabilisation during apoptosis and CICD enabling release of mtDNA (McArthur et al, 2018). The extent of MIMP they observed was significantly less than us, potentially reflecting cell-type differences in the propensity of mitochondria to undergo MIMP. Interestingly, we detected increased permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to small ions, shortly following the onset of MOMP. This increased permeability may explain the transient drop in inner membrane potential immediately following MOMP previously reported by others (Waterhouse et al, 2001). What drives this increased permeability is unknown but we reason it must be transient, since many studies have shown mitochondrial inner membrane potential can be maintained post-MOMP under caspase-inhibited conditions (Bossy-Wetzel et al, 1998;von Ahsen et al, 2000;Waterhouse et al, 2001;Huber et al, 2011). While inner membrane extrusion and MIMP can be temporally separated from mtDNA release, it is possible that the increased permeability of the inner membrane we observe following MOMP may precipitate these later events.How the inner membrane eventually permeabilises remains unclear.

        <p>Following MOMP, our ability to detect inner membrane extrusion and MIMP during cell death was dependent upon inhibition of caspase function. This contrasts with findings from McArthur, Kile and colleagues, whom could detect mtDNA release during (caspase-dependent) apoptosis (McArthur et al, 2018). Notably, induction of mitochondrial apoptosis under caspase-proficient conditions also led to an increase in IFN-b mRNA, albeit not to the same extent as under conditions of CICD (Fig 2D). We therefore think it likely that our inability to visualise MIMP during apoptosis relates to the kinetics of apoptotic cell death being much more rapid than MIMP, such that rounding and detachment of apoptotic cells made them impossible to image over a longer period (Video EV1). Even if MIMP does occur during apoptosis, its functional effects may be limited due to rapid loss of cell viability coupled to the strong inhibitory effects of caspase activity on protein translation (Clemens et al, 2000). Indeed, we and others have shown that MOMP has pro-inflammatory effects only under caspase-inhibited conditions (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017). Nevertheless, physiological engagement of MIMP, leading to mtDNA release and interferon synthesis, might be expected in cell types deficient or defective in caspase activity such as cardiomyocytes and sympathetic neurons following MOMP (Potts et al, 2005;Wright et al, 2007;Potts et al, 2005;Wright et al, 2007). Another possibility relates to our recent finding that sub-lethal stress can engage MOMP in a limited cohort of mitochondria without cell death (Ichim et al, 2015). Whether MIMP and mtDNA release occurs in these permeabilised mitochondria leading to cGAS-STING activation is currently unclear.Following MOMP, our ability to detect inner membrane extrusion and MIMP during cell death was dependent upon inhibition of caspase function.

        <p>Intense interest currently surrounds the pharmaceutical activation of cGAS-STING signalling to improve cancer immunotherapy (Ng et al, 2018). Our own work has shown that engaging MOMP under caspase-inhibited conditions-caspase-independent cell death (CICD)-can potently activate anti-tumour immunity pathway (Giampazolias et al, 2017). The inflammatory effects of CICD are dependent on recognition of mtDNA by the cytosolic cGAS-STING sensing pathway (Rongvaux et al, 2014;White et al, 2014;Giampazolias et al, 2017). Underlying this effect, here we have shown that following MOMP, the inner membrane is extruded via BAX-mediated pores prior to permeabilisation and mtDNA release. mtDNA-dependent activation of cGAS-STING has recently been implicated in variety of pathophysiological processes including infectious and inflammatory diseases (West &amp; Shadel, 2017). As such, further understanding the mechanism(s) of mtDNA mitochondrial release in different contexts may provide new avenues for therapeutic exploitation.Intense interest currently surrounds the pharmaceutical activation of cGAS-STING signalling to improve cancer immunotherapy (Ng et al, 2018).

Cells were incubated with 1 lM of calcein-AM stock solution and 10 mM CoCl 2 in HBSS supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 2 ml L-glutamine for 15 min at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cells were washed twice in HBSS, and then, 900 ll of supplemented HBSS and 10 mM CoCl 2 was added.

        <p>Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor (Roche). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Protein lysates were subjected to electrophoresis through 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/ PBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody over night at 4°C in blocking buffer. Following washing, membranes were incubated with Li-Cor secondary antibodies (IRDye 680RD donkey anti-mouse or IRDye 800CW donkey antirabbit) for 1 h at room temperature and protein levels detected using a Li-Cor Odyssey CLx (Li-Cor) and acquired using

        <p>Cell viability was assayed using an IncuCyte FLR imaging system (Sartorius). Briefly, cells were seeded overnight and drugged in the presence of 30 nM SYTOX Green (Life Technologies), a non-cellpermeable nuclear stain. Where the same cell line was compared, SYTOX Green-positivity was compared directly; where different cell lines (e.g. WT and KO MEFs) were compared, data were normalised to starting confluency. All quantification was performed using the

As expected, TFAM-mScarlet localised to the mitochondrial matrix, co-localising with mtDNA (Fig EV2A). U2OS cells expressing JF 646 -MOM and TFAM-mClover were induced to undergo MOMP AE qVD-OPh and imaged by live-cell imaging (Fig EV2B, Videos EV1-EV3). Under caspaseproficient conditions, following MOMP, the cell rapidly shrunk and detached, consistent with engagement of apoptosis (Video EV1). Under caspase-inhibited conditions, after ABT-737 treatment, TFAM-mClover was released into the cytosol, consistent with our earlier analysis of mtDNA (Fig EV2B, Videos EV2 and EV3). Finally, we investigated the kinetics of TFAM-mClover release and MOM pore widening relative to MOMP. U2OS cells expressing TFAM-mClover, Omi-mCherry and JF 646 -MOM were treated with ABT-737 in combination with the MCL1 inhibitor S63845 in the presence of qVD-OPh then subject to live-cell imaging (Fig 3B, Video EV4). Analysis of individual mitochondria demonstrated, in a sequential manner, that mitochondrial release of Omi-mCherry (denoting MOMP) occurs prior to the visual appearance and widening of MOM pores (In healthy cells, the majority of mtDNA signal was within AIF immunostained structures, in line with AIF being inner membrane localised and mtDNA residing within the matrix (Fig 4A, Video EV5). Importantly, following MOMP (ABT-737/ActD/qVD-OPh treatment), mtDNA was found to localise in the cytoplasm, outside the inner membrane (AIF immunostained structures; Fig 4A, Video EV6localisation of mClover-fused TFAM.
