        <p>The genus Prevotella includes more than 50 characterized species that occur in varied natural habitats, although most Prevotella spp. are associated with humans. In the human microbiome, Prevotella spp. are highly abundant in various body sites, where they are key players in the balance between health and disease. Host factors related to diet, lifestyle and geography are fundamental in affecting the diversity and prevalence of Prevotella species and strains in the human microbiome. These factors, along with the ecological relationship of Prevotella with other members of the microbiome, likely determine the extent of the contribution of Prevotella to human metabolism and health. Here we review the diversity, prevalence and potential connection of Prevotella spp. in the human host, highlighting how genomic methods and analysis have improved and should further help in framing their ecological role. We also provide suggestions for future research to improve understanding of the possible functions of Prevotella spp. and the effects of the Western lifestyle and diet on the host-Prevotella symbiotic relationship in the context of maintaining human health.The genus Prevotella includes more than 50 characterized species that occur in varied natural habitats, although most Prevotella spp. are associated with humans.

        <p>Prevotella is a diverse genus of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that was first described in 1990 by Shar and Collins to include some oral species with specific phenotypic traits (moderately saccharolytic capabilities and bile salt sensitivity) that were formerly placed in the genus Bacteroides. Prevotella was named after the pioneering anaerobic microbiologist A. R. Prévot 1 . The type strain for the genus is from Prevotella melaninogenica, which was isolated by Oliver and Wherry in 1921 from various human body sites and was named for the black pigmentation of its colonies 1,2 . Prevotella spp. are nonspore-forming, non-motile short rods that are saccharolytic or moderately saccharolytic 3,4 . The genus Prevotella is part of the family Prevotellaceae, which also contains the three closely related genera Paraprevotella, Alloprevotella and Hallella.Prevotella is a diverse genus of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria that was first described in 1990 by Shar and Collins to include some oral species with specific phenotypic traits (moderately saccharolytic capabilities and bile salt sensitivity) that were formerly placed in the genus Bacteroides.

        <p>Prevotella spp. have been isolated from various animal hosts and even occur free living in the environment. In comparison with other genera, which contain members with clear associations with disease or that are easily cultured, Prevotella has received less attention, maybe due to limitations in culturing these bacteria and confusion in phenotype-based taxonomic classification of isolates 5,6 . Nevertheless, the advent of cultivation-free microbial profiling showed that Prevotella spp. are common, abundant, consistent features of mammal-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) and in humans have been found to inhabit multiple body sites, including the skin, oral cavity, vagina and gastrointestinal tract. Prevotella spp. are not rare in human microbiomes, and they are members of one of the most dominant genera in the oral cavity 7 . In rural populations that follow a more pre-industrial, 'traditional' lifestyle and diet -so-called 'non-Westernized populations' -Prevotella spp. tend to dominate the gut microbiome [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] . Westernization is the consequence of industrialization over the past 200 years. While separating populations into Westernized and non-Westernized categories demarcates what is best seen as a continuum and is not without its difficulties (as discussed elsewhere [14][15][16] ), multiple reports have consistently highlighted a decreased prevalence of Prevotella spp. in Westernized populations, which is generally compensated by the domination of Bacteroides species [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] . Our understanding of the human microbiome is skewed towards Western populations, and therefore Bacteroides spp. have received more attention than Prevotella spp., although as the number of non-Westernized populations sampled expands, the diversity, prevalence, abundance and importance of Prevotella is becoming increasingly evident. This is particularly true for intestinal Prevotella spp., which have been shown to be long-standing key members of our co-evolved microbiome, supporting the hypothesis that the modern Western lifestyle is causal in the loss of Prevotella diversity and further raising the question of what are the consequences of this loss from a health perspective 16 .Prevotella spp. have been isolated from various animal hosts and even occur free living in the environment.

        <p>Despite the abundance and prevalence of Prevotella spp. associated with humans, their involvement in health and disease, their role within the microbiome and their contribution to host-microbiome crosstalk are unclear. Prevotella contains no known obligate pathogenic species, yet members have been implicated in multiple diseases, including inflammatory autoimmune diseases 17 , opportunistic infections [18][19][20][21] , bacterial vaginosis 22 and oral biofilm formation and diseases 23,24 , although direct causation of disease is uncertain. Similarly, in the intestine, there are conflicting reports regarding whether Prevotella spp. are beneficial or detrimental to health, particularly in glucose homeostasis [25][26][27] . Establishing general associations and specific causal links between Prevotella and disease is likely further confounded by the recent discovery that this genus may be more diverse than previously appreciated 4,16 . In the view of the human microbiome as an integral part of human biology, Prevotella is an exemplar case of a genus that is likely involved in intricate ecological interactions and crosstalk with the host, with indirect but potentially substantial effects on human health.Despite the abundance and prevalence of Prevotella spp. associated with humans, their involvement in health and disease, their role within the microbiome and their contribution to host-microbiome crosstalk are unclear.

        <p>In light of the open questions regarding these enigmatic bacteria, it is timely to discuss the genus Prevotella and its association and distribution on and within the human host, across ages, lifestyles and diseases. Using available genomes from cultivated strains and those recovered directly from thousands of metagenomic samples (Box 1), we explore and summarize the overall diversity and current knowledge of the genus Prevotella, as well as the role of Prevotella spp. in human health and disease.In light of the open questions regarding these enigmatic bacteria, it is timely to discuss the genus Prevotella and its association and distribution on and within the human host, across ages, lifestyles and diseases.

        <p>Since the initial isolation of Prevotella spp. from the human oral cavity and respiratory tract, they have been shown to occupy ecologically diverse habitats. Currently, 57 species of Prevotella for which isolates are publicly available (Fig. 1; TaBle 1; Supplementary Table 1) have been characterized. By far the largest number of isolates and known species are associated with human hosts, but Prevotella spp. can also be found associated with other mammalian hosts. For example, Prevotella spp. are a common and predominant feature of the gut microbiota of ruminants; in particular, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Prevotella brevis and Prevotella albensis are well-known members 28,29 . Prevotella spp. are integral in carbohydrate utilization in the rumen 30 and are a particularly common feature of the swine gut microbiome 31,32 . Genomes of other members of the Prevotellaceae have been recovered from non-human primates, dogs and mice 33,34 (Supplementary Table 1) and non-mammalian hosts, including from the fermentative crop of the tropical bird Opisthocomus hoazin (the hoatzin) and have been found free living in natural habitats, including soil 35 .Since the initial isolation of Prevotella spp. from the human oral cavity and respiratory tract, they have been shown to occupy ecologically diverse habitats.

        <p>The distinguishing feature between human and non-human isolates of Prevotella is their species-level evolutionary history, as inferred from whole-genome phylogenetics (Fig. 1; Supplementary Box 1). There is clustering of large subtrees, in which human-associated species are mostly separated from those of non-human origin (Fig. 1), and a large multispecies clade is present, which comprises P. ruminicola and P. brevis and numerous unnamed species that are specific to swine and ruminants. The genome size of the isolates differs: the largest genome (4.26 Mb) is from a member of the Prevotella copri complex, and Prevotella amnii has the smallest genome (2.37 Mb) (Fig. 1; TaBle 1). In comparison, the average genome size for Bacteroides spp. The study of human-associated Prevotella spp. has been hampered by the intrinsic difficulty in cultivating in vitro some taxa, especially anaerobic strains in the gut. By surveying the genetic content of complex microbial samples by high-throughput sequencing (that is, metagenomics 60 ), it is possible not only to identify and quantify known species but also to discover previously uncharacterized 'novel' species.The distinguishing feature between human and non-human isolates of Prevotella is their species-level evolutionary history, as inferred from whole-genome phylogenetics (Fig. 1; Supplementary Box 1).

        <p>This approach is becoming increasingly effective by metagenomic assembly, which first reconstructs relatively long fragments of the genomes (called 'contigs') 181,182 and then groups contigs into draft genomes termed 'metagenome-assembled genomes' (MAGs) by exploiting read coverage and intrinsic genetic features (such as tetranucleotide frequency distribution) across contigs 183 . After quality control of the resulting MAGs 184 , high-quality sequences can be phylogenetically and taxonomically contextualized 185 , revealing in many cases that MAGs do not belong to any previously named or catalogued species. As metagenomic assembly reaches maturity, large collections of MAGs are being built and analysed 15,49,50 . Currently, more than 200,000 MAGs have been deposited in catalogues that are based on many large human metagenomic studies; thousands of these MAGs have expanded the strain-level genetic diversity of known species, while many others define new species-level genome bins, which are interpreted as yet-to-be cultivated new candidate species. Applied to the genus Prevotella, such approaches confirmed the existence of at least four genetically and functionally distinct clades of Prevotella copri that form a species complex 4,16 , and a total of 4,886 human-associated MAGs that are assigned to the family Prevotellaceae but do not belong to any known Prevotella spp. 15 . (Fig. 3). While in vitro cultivation remains indispensable to understand the physiology of bacterial species and their possible involvement in host diseases, metagenomic assembly is emerging as a key tool to characterize previously overlooked bacterial diversity, drive targeted cultivation efforts and formulate hypotheses on the biomedical relevance of some taxa. Only named species are reported in the tree, which was built using a maximum likelihood approach applied on marker genes. b | Genome characteristics for Prevotella spp. with at least five available genomes. The average number of coding sequences (CDSs) ranges between 2,000 and 3,300. The core size (that is, the number of CDSs that are present in almost all genomes) ranges from 1,200 to 1,900 genes. The pangenome size ranges between 2,600 and 10,400 genes; however, this is partially affected by the number of available genomes (Spearman correlation between genome number and pangenome size of 0.64).

There is also a considerable spread in G+C content across the genus, ranging from 36.4% in P. amnii to 56.1% in Prevotella dentalis (TaBle 1), which is further evidence of the remarkable diversity of Prevotella. A comparison of the core genome for species for which there are multiple independent isolates reveals that Prevotella spp. have a core of ~1,200-1,900 genes (accounting for ~50-75% of the genome), which is consistent for species from different host types (Fig. 1 yet like most isolate collections, it likely suffers from sampling bias; increased isolation efforts from animal species and undersampled environments will surely expand the number of hosts and diversity of Prevotella spp.This approach is becoming increasingly effective by metagenomic assembly, which first reconstructs relatively long fragments of the genomes (called 'contigs') 181,182 and then groups contigs into draft genomes termed 'metagenome-assembled genomes' (MAGs) by exploiting read coverage and intrinsic genetic features (such as tetranucleotide frequency distribution) across contigs 183 .

        <p>The ecological importance of bacteriophages (phages) in shaping the complex host-associated microbiome has been established; nevertheless, investigation of these phage communities is still in its infancy 36 . Consequently, little is known about Prevotella-specific phages, with only a few reports describing phages associated with Prevotella spp. in ruminants 37,38 . Recently, metagenomics-based discovery has identified large 'megaphages' termed 'Lak phages, ' which are associated with Prevotella spp. in humans, non-human primates, other mammalian hosts and reptiles 39,40 . These phages use an alternative genetic code and, with a genome size of up to ~660 kb, they are the largest intestinal phages discovered to date 40 . The identification of these diverse phages raises intriguing questions about their ability to modulate Prevotella populations in the intestine and the implications of this modulation on the whole microbiome and ultimately on its influence on the host.The ecological importance of bacteriophages (phages) in shaping the complex host-associated microbiome has been established; nevertheless, investigation of these phage communities is still in its infancy 36 .

        <p>Even within a specific host, different Prevotella spp. are present in multiple different body locations. In humans, and similarly to other bacterial genera 41 , distinct Prevotella spp. have been identified and isolated from the oral cavity, respiratory tract, vagina, skin and intestine. Surveying the prevalence and abundance of the known characterized Prevotella spp. in more than 9,500 individuals from multiple integrated datasets 15 reveals that, with the exception of vaginal Prevotella spp., most species are body-site-specific (Fig. 2a,b; Supplementary Box 2). A genome-based analysis of human Prevotella isolates identified differing functional potential at different body sites, suggesting the existence of niche-specific differentiation and specialization 42 . Further stratification is also observed across lifestyles; non-Westernized populations, which follow a more traditional lifestyle and diet, tend to have a higher prevalence of several distinct Prevotella spp. [8][9][10][11][12][13] in both the gut and the oral cavity (Fig. 2c). The distribution of Prevotella spp. is also influenced by age; in the gut, both P. copri and Prevotella stercorea show an age-dependent increase in prevalence regardless of Westernization, although their relative abundance drops from adulthood to old age (more than 65 years) (Fig. 2a,b). However, some species (Prevotella bivia, Prevotella timonensis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella disiens and Prevotella corporis) seem to have the highest prevalence in the gut of elderly individuals in Westernized populations and, intriguingly, they have a correspondingly similar prevalence pattern in the vagina (Fig. 2a,b). Sex effects have also been observed, with Prevotella being more prevalent in men than women 43,44 . However, female hormone metabolism seems to be linked to the regulation of Prevotella spp. in the human body. Steroidal hormones can favour the growth of Prevotella intermedia and P. melaninogenica in the oral cavity 45,46 and affect oral microbial ecology and the occurrence of gingivitis in hormone-driven diseases 47 . It is evident that the distribution and prevalence of Prevotella spp. in the human host are driven by multiple factors, including body site, lifestyle, sex and age, and this is an area of continued research. and relative abundance (part b) of known Prevotella spp. across four main body sites (that is, the oral cavity (saliva or oral swabs), the skin (cutaneous swabs), the gut (stool samples) and the vagina (vaginal swabs)), five age categories (that is, newborn, child, school-age child, adult and senior) and two main lifestyles (that is, Westernized and non-Westernized).

        <p>While strain isolation has been, and continues to be, the predominant approach in microbiological research, culture-independent methods offer a new complementary approach in microbial discovery. For example, recovering and identifying genomes directly from mixed environmental samples (metagenomes) has begun to transform our understanding of the true microbial diversity in natural systems 4,15,16,[48][49][50][51] and gives an unprecedented opportunity to characterize the role and ecology of Prevotella by exploiting the increasingly available large metagenomic datasets. To assess Prevotella diversity in the human host, we examined 7,480 Prevotella-assigned metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from more than 9,500 human-associated metagenomes covering multiple geographic populations, lifestyles and body sites in combination with the isolate genomes from multiple sources in public repositories 15 . Fifty-six Prevotella species-level genome bins (SGBs; using a 5% nucleotide whole-genome distance threshold to define the bins) were identified with at least 20 genomes reconstructed from human sources. Of these, only 32 SGBs were populated with at least one isolate genome with assigned taxonomy (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Box 3), demonstrating that human-associated Prevotella spp. are far more diverse than appreciable from the current catalogue of Prevotella isolates. These unnamed and uncharacterized Prevotella SGBs are not all rare metagenomic occurrences, as in some cases hundreds of genomes were recovered from independent metagenomic samples (Fig. 3a,b). Of note, nine uncharacterized SGBs are at the boundary of the Prevotella genus (Fig. 3a; subtree at the root) and contain only two isolate genomes, labelled as 'Prevotellaceae bacterium' .While strain isolation has been, and continues to be, the predominant approach in microbiological research, culture-independent methods offer a new complementary approach in microbial discovery.

Of note, nine uncharacterized SGBs are at the boundary of the Prevotella genus (Fig. 3a; subtree at the root) and contain only two isolate genomes, labelled as 'Prevotellaceae bacterium' .</p>
        <p>The oral cavity is the body site that hosts by far the largest diversity of known human Prevotella spp. (Fig. 2; Fig. 3). While the human gut may still harbour many undiscovered Prevotella spp. that are particularly recalcitrant to cultivation (Fig. 3b), the oral Prevotella taxa were studied long before the advent of cultivation-free surveys 52 owing to their less complex cultivation conditions and their potential (sometimes confirmed) role in oral diseases 53 and systemic infections 54 . According to the first comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequencing investigation, the total abundance of the genus Prevotella in the oral cavity of healthy individuals exceeds, on average, 10% of the whole microbiome of the saliva (13.0%), tongue (10.3%), tonsils (11.4%) and throat (11.6%) 7 . Recent microbiome studies confirmed even higher average abundances in the saliva (from 12% to 17%) in multiple socio-economic and age categories 55,56 , making Prevotella the most abundant oral genus after Streptococcus. Slightly lower Prevotella abundance is estimated in oral locations that have more divergent structural and biochemical conditions, such as the dental plaque, the gingiva and the buccal mucosa 7 . Our analysis (Fig. 2) gives an overall Prevotella prevalence of 85% in Westernized populations when all oral sites are combined and 100% in non-Westernized populations, with an average abundance of 7.4% and 11.5% respectively. Our oral metagenomic data for non-Westernized populations are based on a single cohort from Fiji 57 , but reanalysis of another dataset of Filipino individuals 58 confirmed the intriguing observation of higher prevalence and abundance of Prevotella in the oral cavity of individuals from non-Westernized populations. Interestingly, the levels of P. intermedia in the saliva microbiome decrease when a Mediterranean diet nutritional intervention is initiated in individuals with obesity 59 , suggesting a dependence of oral Prevotella on lifestyle factors that may include those connected with the Westernization process.The oral cavity is the body site that hosts by far the largest diversity of known human Prevotella spp. (Fig. 2; Fig. 3).

        <p>Genus-level quantification clearly conceals extensive species-level and interindividual diversity that is now readily detectable by shotgun metagenomics 60 . Available metagenomic analyses [61][62][63][64][65] point to the presence of at least 15 known Prevotella spp. in the oral cavity (and a couple of taxa that are still to be characterized; Fig. 3); however, the oral microbiome in individuals is usually dominated by P. melaninogenica and, to a slightly lesser extent, Prevotella histicola and P. intermedia in adult non-Westernized populations (Fig. 2). Recent analyses for other oral genera in the context of the healthy oral microbiome, such as Neisseria 41 , Streptococcus 66 and other genera 67,68 , revealed extensive strain-level variation hidden at the species level, and that strains within a species are individual-specific except for related individuals such as mother-infant couples in which direct transmission can occur 63,69,70 . Currently, such strain-level analyses are not available for oral Prevotella spp., and while the extent of within-species genetic and genomic variability is species-specific, it is likely that similar strain-level variation and individual specificity will also be observed for Prevotella spp.Genus-level quantification clearly conceals extensive species-level and interindividual diversity that is now readily detectable by shotgun metagenomics 60 .

        <p>As for other members of the oral microbiome, oral Prevotella spp. have the potential to colonize the lower gastrointestinal tract. Indeed, a systematic metagenomic investigation of oral to gut microbial transmission 71 found that all oral Prevotella spp. can occasionally be found in the stool microbiome (Fig. 2b) and, in most cases, the oral and gut strains were the same within a host, suggesting a direct oral-faecal route in healthy individuals. Interestingly, high enrichment of oral species in the gut has been observed in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer 72,73 , although only P. intermedia and, to a lesser extent, Prevotella nigrescens are biomarkers of this cancer.

        <p>In the oral cavity, Prevotella is also involved in the complex process of biofilm formation, which is potentially connected with poor oral hygiene 24 and involved in the cause of oral diseases, such as prevalent gingivitis and periodontitis 23 . In particular, P. nigrescens and P. intermedia are associated with the plaque microbiome in periodontitis, an association that was already established in the presequencing era 75 , and these two species may promote tissue inflammation by driving T helper 17 cell (T H 17 cell)-mediated immune responses 23,76 . Intriguingly, complementary fluorescence in situ hybridization-based investigations of dental plaque 77,78 identified Prevotella spp. as one of the early colonizers that are necessary for stable biofilm formation. Several Prevotella spp., including Prevotella loescheii, www.nature.com/nrmicro R e v i e w s 0123456789();: P. intermedia and Prevotella denticola, may have a role in the early and middle stages of biofilm formation by promoting cell-cell adhesion and creating the physical and biochemical conditions that favour later colonizers 79,80 . The microbial consortia in oral biofilms can be very diverse; for example, in biofilm models in the absence of Streptococcus species, the abundance of P. intermedia increases and filamented chains that resemble those of streptococci are formed 81 . Prevotella spp. can also synergistically support Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a species that is strongly associated with aggressive periodontitis 82 , by molecular interspecies regulation 83 .In the oral cavity, Prevotella is also involved in the complex process of biofilm formation, which is potentially connected with poor oral hygiene 24 and involved in the cause of oral diseases, such as prevalent gingivitis and periodontitis 23 .

        <p>Although an area of continuous research for many years, the complexity of oral biofilm formation and the intricate interactions of the biofilm community with host tissues and immunity remain only partially understood. Furthermore, the hypothetical role of low-abundance taxa and of synergistic bacterial interactions 84 further underlines the relevance of biofilm formation as a model for microbial ecology and as a potential therapeutic target. Prevotella is likely one of the most relevant genera in this context, as physical proximity analysis revealed that, together with Actinomyces, this genus had the highest intergenus interactions 77 . Isolate sequences were integrated with metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) retrieved from more than 10,000 metagenomes and more than 50 human populations. For each species, 15 randomly selected genomes are reported along with the information on the host type (that is, human or mixed sources), the public availability of isolate sequences and the number of retrieved genomes.

        <p>Vaginal Prevotella spp. The human vaginal microbiome has been comprehensively surveyed, and Prevotella stands out as one of the dominant genera 88 . The most prevalent vaginal species are P. bivia, P. timonensis, P. buccalis, P. disiens and P. corporis. Interestingly, these species belong to separate phylogenetic clusters and none occurs uniquely in the urogenital tract, as they are also found in the oral and/or gut microbiome (Fig. 2). However, it is possible that for these species, genomic adaptation to the different body sites may occur at the subspecies level and is therefore undetectable at the species level. Prevotella spp. have a recognized role in bacterial vaginosis, which occurs when the protective guilds of the normally dominant Lactobacillus species are lost and strictly anaerobic microorganisms become established 22 . Prevotella spp. are the most heritable vaginal bacteria and are also associated with increased body mass index 22,89 . P. bivia is an important source of ammonia, lipopolysaccharide and sialidase activity in vaginal mucus and is linked to epithelial cytokine production, which occurs in infected uterine and placental tissues and amniotic fluid during pregnancy complications [90][91][92] . P. bivia often co-occurs with Gardnerella vaginalis, and this is recognized as a clear example of how microbial species can interact synergistically in certain environments. These two bacteria are co-abundant in the vagina and both are increased in abundance in cases of bacterial vaginosis 93 , although neither induces a robust inflammatory response 94 . Their co-inoculation has no major effect on their growth in mouse models of bacterial vaginosis, although co-colonization seemed to increase the chances of P. bivia ascension to the uterus 90 , which is relevant for the recognized association of Prevotella spp. with increased risk of preterm birth [95][96][97] . Interestingly, a network of other Prevotella spp., including P. amnii, P. buccalis and P. timonensis, can co-occur in other infections, such as those caused by Chlamydia trachomatis 98 , and have a role in bacterial vaginosis and increased predisposition to viral infections such as HIV infection 99,100 .

        <p>In the absence of further data to clarify the role of Prevotella spp. and strains in the development of bacterial vaginosis and related diseases, Prevotella simply appears as an inhabitant of the female urogenital tract that opportunistically increases in abundance when the abundance of protective vaginal lactobacilli is reduced.In the absence of further data to clarify the role of Prevotella spp. and strains in the development of bacterial vaginosis and related diseases, Prevotella simply appears as an inhabitant of the female urogenital tract that opportunistically increases in abundance when the abundance of protective vaginal lactobacilli is reduced.</p>
        <p>The human gut is home to many microbial species, belonging predominantly to the phylum Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes 61,103 . Of the Bacteroidetes, two genera tend to dominate, Bacteroides and Prevotella, while the dominant Firmicutes genera include Ruminococcus, Blautia, Eubacterium and Faecalibacterium. The observation that these groups of taxa drive a subject-specific microbiome type led to the concept of human gut enterotypes 104 . Since its introduction almost 10 years ago, this concept has fed further studies and fuelled debate within the field 105 , which resulted in a revisited formulation of the enterotypes as non-discrete microbiome types 106 . It is clear that Prevotella spp. (particularly members of the P. copri complex) seem to be a discrete and well-defined feature of the gut microbiome, and their relative abundance is inversely correlated with that of the Bacteroides; that is, the presence of one seems to result in exclusion of the other 61,104,107 . Nevertheless, quantitative profiling based on absolute abundance suggests that this inverse correlation may simply be an artefact of microbiome profiling approaches based on relative abundance 108 . In the human gut, the average prevalence of Prevotella spp. ranges from 20% to 100% depending on the population surveyed 109 . Of the characterized Prevotella spp., P. stercorea and the P. copri complex are the two most common. Of note, despite both species being present in the gut, they are more phylogenetically distant from each other compared with other Prevotella spp. that occupy other body sites (Figs 1,2).

        <p>Of the human intestinal Prevotella spp., the most recognized and relevant member is P. copri. Although P. copri is not universally present, when identified it tends to be highly abundant 15 . P. copri has increasingly come under the spotlight owing to conflicting reports about whether its effect on human health is positive or detrimental [25][26][27] . Detrimental effects include inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis 17,110,111 , increased mucosal and systemic immune activation in patients with HIV infection 112 or ankylosing spondylitis 113 , and exacerbating Listeria monocytogenes intestinal infection 114 . The association of Prevotella and P. copri with rheumatoid arthritis 115 was reported on the basis of their abundance in the faecal microbiome 17,116,117 and presence in the synovial fluid 110,118 (Supplementary Table 2). An increased Prevotella abundance has been associated not only with patients with symptomatic rheumatoid arthritis but also with individuals at high risk of developing the disease, including those with rheumatoid arthritis-predisposing genotypes 111,119 . In preclinical models, faecal transplantation from patients with early-stage rheumatoid arthritis who have increased abundance of P. copri induced a proinflammatory T H 17 cell response and rheumatoid arthritis phenotype in mice prone to rheumatoid arthritis 120 .

        <p>Two studies in 2019 expanded the concept of P. copri genetic and functional diversity, combining a large-scale meta-analysis of publicly available metagenomes (more than 6,800) with a targeted isolation and sequencing of human P. copri isolates 4,16 . These studies revealed that, in contrast to what had been previously assumed, P. copri is not monotypic (that is, it is not a single species-level lineage) but is a complex comprising four genetically distinct clades designated A-D 16 (Fig. 1). The average nucleotide identity (13-21.4%) shared between clades is greater than would be expected within a single species lineage (less than 5-6%) [124][125][126] . Prevotella spp. have long been associated with non-Westernized populations, where they tend to be the dominant bacteria in the gut [8][9][10][11][12][13] . Analysis of the prevalence of the P. copri complex in these populations confirmed that it is very common (95.4% in non-Westernized populations versus 29.6% in Westernized populations) 16 and is a long-standing constituent of the human microbiome, having been identified in ancient faecal and intestinal contents (Box 2), but is rapidly being lost, most likely owing to the process of Westernization. Another revelation was the presence of multiple cohabiting P. copri clades within an individual. The presence of multiple P. copri clades was more likely than the presence of a single clade in non-Westernized individuals (more than two clades present in 93.5% of non-Westernized individuals versus 32.1% in Westernized individuals) 16 . This result suggests that the members of the P. copri complex are niche separated and potentially complementary, as the same result has also been obtained in mice studies 127 .Two studies in 2019 expanded the concept of P. copri genetic and functional diversity, combining a large-scale meta-analysis of publicly available metagenomes (more than 6,800) with a targeted isolation and sequencing of human P. copri isolates 4,16 .

        <p>Gut Prevotella, diet and health. Intestinal Prevotella spp. and the P. copri complex in particular are commonly associated with non-Western diets and nutritional patterns rich in carbohydrates, resistant starch and fibre 8,[128][129][130][131][132] . In Western-style diets, members of the class Clostridia (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) often contribute as degraders of dietary fibre 133 , although nutritional interventions with fibre-rich foods usually result in an increase in Prevotella abundance 131,[134][135][136][137] . In addition, a loss of members of the order Bacteroidales (including Prevotella) was observed in humanized mice fed a diet with low amounts of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates from dietary fibre 138 . The first attempts to develop a microbiome-oriented personalized nutrition demonstrated that stratifying individuals on the basis of microbiome composition may be a way to maximize clinical responses to dietary treatments. Indeed, having a Prevotella-rich gut microbiome potentiates weight loss [139][140][141][142] , decreases cholesterol levels 143 and limits the bifidogenic effect 144 in individuals consuming a fibre-rich diet. Improved glucose metabolism from fibre consumption has also been attributed to a higher Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio and succinate metabolism 145,146 . A study examining the association between gut bacteria and postprandial responses in more than 1,000 individuals identified P. copri as potentially beneficial in glucose homeostasis and host metabolism 147 . By contrast, another study found that P. copri was associated with insulin resistance 148 , and lower baseline levels of P. copri were linked to a reduction in insulin resistance in overweight individuals following a Mediterranean diet intervention 149 .Gut Prevotella, diet and health. Intestinal Prevotella spp. and the P. copri complex in particular are commonly associated with non-Western diets and nutritional patterns rich in carbohydrates, resistant starch and fibre 8,[128][129][130][131][132] . In Western-style diets, members of the class Clostridia (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) often contribute as degraders of dietary fibre 133 , although nutritional interventions with fibre-rich foods usually result in an increase in Prevotella abundance 131,[134][135][136][137] . In addition, a loss of members of the order Bacteroidales (including Prevotella) was observed in humanized mice fed a diet with low amounts of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates from dietary fibre 138 .

        <p>These effects might be explained by the potential of Prevotella spp. to degrade the complex polysaccharides in individuals with a mixed, high-fibre diet. This is relevant to human metabolism because the human genome encodes enzymes for the degradation of only a limited number of carbohydrates, including sucrose, lactose and starch 150 . Consequently, the ability of gut microorganisms to ferment polysaccharides is crucial in human nutrition. Prevotella spp. are proficient producers of the short-chain fatty acid propionate from arabinoxylans and fructo-oligosaccharides in vitro 151 , and the efficiency of specific strains in degrading these polysaccharides is linked with dominance patterns of Prevotella in mice 127 .

        <p>The human microbiome is the result of a continuous interplay and co-evolution of microbial communities with the human host. Understandably, our knowledge of the microbiome relating to human health has been gleaned almost exclusively from biological samples collected from modern contemporary populations; more specifically, populations that have undergone Westernization, a process driven by industrialization and culminating in dietary and lifestyle changes. Recently, comparison of the microbiome of Westernized populations with that of contemporary non-Westernized populations (that is, those that follow a more traditional lifestyle and diet) revealed stark differences 8-15 . This raises interesting questions: how similar is the microbiome in Westernized populations to the long established, co-evolved 'ancestral' human microbiome, and are non-Westernized populations a better representation of this ancestral microbiome? Ancient samples have started to give a historical snapshot of the microorganisms that were present in our ancestors and how they have evolved, with the help of accurate dating of samples using molecular clocks 186 . These studies have focused primarily on the evolution of human pathogens and were made possible from samples where microbial DNA has been preserved, such as dental calculus or pulp and other skeletal remains. Examples include the unravelling of the evolutionary and adaptive trajectories of Yersinia pestis, the cause of the Black Death 187 , and Mycobacterium tuberculosis 188 (reviewed elsewhere 189 ). Although small in number, ancient microbiomes from stool or intestinal samples have become available, including those from coprolites (fossilized faeces) and the Iceman (Ötzi) 16 , a natural ice mummy 190 . These studies have provided an initial awareness of how the ancestral human microbiome compares with that of contemporary populations. For example, analysis of the Iceman offered an insight into the historical global spread and evolutionary history of the stomach parasite Helicobacter pylori 191 . Ancient samples also revealed that the divergence of Prevotella copri into four distinct clades may possibly predate modern humans, and P. copri was almost certainly a core species in the microbiome of populations before the waves of human migration out of Africa 16 . As a consequence, the decreased prevalence of P. copri in the microbiome of Westernized populations compared with non-Westernized populations suggests that the non-Westernized microbiome is more representative of the co-evolved microbiome. However, to definitively answer this question, efforts are needed to increase the number of ancient samples from different human populations. Nevertheless, the increasing evidence that Westernized microbiomes are not accurate representations of our ancestral microbiome raises the question of whether this perturbation is ultimately detrimental to overall health, and warrants further investigation.The human microbiome is the result of a continuous interplay and co-evolution of microbial communities with the human host.

A highly specialized enzymatic potential, with remarkable strain-level variation, has been demonstrated in vitro and is responsible for complex polysaccharide degradation by different strains of the P. copri complex 4 . The diversity and mechanism of complex polysaccharide digestion is driven by the starch utilization system (Sus) comprising different transmembrane proteins (such as SusC) that transport polysaccharides into the periplasm. The genes encoding these transport proteins are usually located in polysaccharide utilization loci (together with degradation enzyme genes) and are selectively overexpressed on exposure of P. copri strains to different plant polysaccharides, with such exposure influencing growth capability 4 . Consequently, it might be plausible that the higher the P. copri diversity in the gut, the greater the number of types of complex polysaccharides that can be potentially utilized. Indeed, strain-level variation in P. copri genomes seems to be dependent on different dietary habits 123,154 , and such diversity may simply be driven by selective exposure of individuals to different types and amounts of plant polysaccharides.

        <p>Overall, the literature supporting a key role for Prevotella, and especially the P. copri complex, in driving individual clinical and metabolic responses to diet variation and to health status is substantial. However, the mechanisms of microbial contributions to these responses are far from clear, and this uncertainty is likely the cause of debate about whether Prevotella and P. copri are beneficial or detrimental in human health 26,27,155 . Factors that prevent clarity on the role of Prevotella spp. in gut health include the species-level and strain-level variability of gut Prevotella, in particular how many clades of the P. copri complex are present, which can hugely affect the response to different diets; and the variability of the dietary patterns studied, which all have a different supply of fibre and/or fibre-rich foods. The Prevotella arsenal of enzymes for digestion of polysaccharides represents an invaluable resource for optimal digestion dynamics and gut homeostasis. Thus, the current most likely interpretation is that the higher the diversity of Prevotella spp. (and other fibre degraders), the more advantageous the fermenting ability of the microbiome will be for the benefit of the human gut.Overall, the literature supporting a key role for Prevotella, and especially the P. copri complex, in driving individual clinical and metabolic responses to diet variation and to health status is substantial.

        <p>Prevotella spp. as potential pathogens Prevotella spp. have been implicated in local and systemic infections, so to determine the extent of their involvement, we analysed the available literature by using a systematic approach (see Supplementary Box 4). Studies linking Prevotella spp. with human infections are mostly observational (43%), but there are also case reports and retrospective and prospective studies (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Fig. 2a). Prevotella spp. are most commonly associated with infections in the oral cavity, with periodontal infections (n = 31) and endodontic infections (n = 35) being the most frequently reported. Of the non-oral infections, musculoskeletal, head and neck, lower respiratory tract and skin infections have been reported (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Interestingly, oral infections may cause secondary systemic or organ-related infections 156 . For example, cases of Prevotella-related bacteraemia after dental extraction 157 or periodontal probing 158 have been documented, as well as a case of liver pyogenic abscess related to dental disease 159 . Furthermore, a relationship between oral infections and cardiac diseases has also been proposed 160 . In other cases, Prevotella-related infections have occurred as a result of major diseases, such as heart failure 161 , in individuals with a compromised immune system 162 or as a complication of surgery [162][163][164][165][166] .Prevotella spp. as potential pathogens Prevotella spp. have been implicated in local and systemic infections, so to determine the extent of their involvement, we analysed the available literature by using a systematic approach (see Supplementary Box 4).

        <p>P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. nigrescens and P. melaninogenica are the species most frequently associated with infections in humans (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 2d). However, the methods that are routinely used to identify Prevotella taxa have ranged from standard clinical microbiology methods to low-throughput or highthroughput molecular approaches, and species-level identification was reliably achieved in only a fraction of these clinical cases. Bacterial isolation and cultivation were the most prevalent methods (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 2c), especially in clinical case reports. Particular attention must be paid to the 'causation' link in clinical cases, as the mere presence of Prevotella spp. does not indicate causality, whereas isolation of Prevotella spp. from blood or from infection fluids provides some evidence that they are the cause of infection, especially if the infection involves a single bacterial species. However, for oral infections, Prevotella can be present in the infection site as a consequence of its presence in the (healthy) oral microbiome. A causative role for Prevotella spp. in infections has rarely been confirmed by reproducing the human disease phenotype in animal models. In a bacterial vaginosis mouse model, co-inoculation of P. bivia with Gardnerella vaginalis reproduced some features of human bacterial vaginosis, including uterus ascension, epithelial exfoliation and sialidase activity 90 . Overall, only a small percentage of studies have addressed the causative role of Prevotella spp. (Fig. 4b), and for only a few infections (for example, genitourinary infections) or in autoimmunity (for example, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis) has the pathogenic potential of Prevotella strains been further questioned. Furthermore, in most cases (60%; Supplementary Fig. 2b) Prevotella spp. tend to co-infect humans with other microorganisms 167,168 , suggesting that, while not obligate pathogens, Prevotella spp. may be opportunistic pathogens, alone or synergistically with other microorganisms, when the ecological conditions allow.P. intermedia, P. bivia, P. nigrescens and P. melaninogenica are the species most frequently associated with infections in humans (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 2d).

        <p>Prevotella is the second most abundant genus in the human oral cavity, and when present, it is frequently the most abundant in the gut microbiome. Therefore, it is surprising how little is known about this genus and it is puzzling why other oral and intestinal genera have received much more attention. This discrepancy can be explained only partially by the substantially non-pathogenic nature of Prevotella spp. and the difficulty in cultivating intestinal Prevotella taxa. However, two main aspects are stimulating the study of this genus: the increased availability of (untargeted) metagenomic datasets (Box 1) of the human microbiome that can reveal the hidden Prevotella diversity across worldwide populations, and the recognition that intestinal Prevotella spp. are key players in host-microbiome interactions, especially in relation to nutrition and metabolism.Prevotella is the second most abundant genus in the human oral cavity, and when present, it is frequently the most abundant in the gut microbiome.

        <p>A number of important questions and research directions could have a considerable impact on the current understanding of Prevotella genomics and ecology. First, there is now overwhelming evidence that the abundance of Prevotella spp. in oral and intestinal microbiomes is higher in non-Westernized populations than in Westernized populations [8][9][10][11][12][13]15,57,58 . Analysis of ancient microbiome samples supports the theory, at least for the P. copri complex, that the loss of Prevotella diversity is associated with, and is likely driven by, the process of Westernization and is not just a common feature of modern non-industrialized communities 16 . Other gut bacteria may be subject to the same forces, but the link with a Western lifestyle is stronger for Prevotella on the basis of the observed differential prevalence and within-subject genus-level diversity. Because Prevotella spp. in the intestine also tend to be highly abundant, some of the differences observed for other bacterial species across populations with different lifestyles could partially be 2 includes all the data extracted from the articles included in this work). The thickness of the edges is proportional to the number of articles reporting the involvement of Prevotella spp. in diseases. While some species were specifically associated with one disease group, a few were shared among the three categories. Cases for which species identification was not available are labelled as 'Prevotella spp.'. The number of the four most abundant Prevotella spp. associated with each detailed disease is shown in Supplementary Fig. 4d. b | Proposed role of Prevotella spp. in human diseases. The percentage of studies for each disease (with at least four studies linking them with Prevotella spp.) are categorized on the basis of the identification method, namely 'isolation' (standard microbiology approaches of isolation and cultivation without mechanistic or causative investigation), 'association' (low-input or high-input molecular approaches, such as species-specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing that surveys the presence of bacteria in a sample) and 'causation' (studies in which the causative role of Prevotella spp. in the infection was demonstrated in animal models). Most of the studies providing evidence of a link between Prevotella and disease are isolation-based or merely associative. Diseases are ordered on the basis of a descending 'isolation' order, and the total number of studies considered per disease is indicated.

Further investigation to understand the genetic and ecological features driving the distinct host-Prevotella equilibrium is thus urgently needed. Unravelling such features will be particularly crucial in combination with a good study design when assessing which of the multiple lifestyle aspects (including diet, availability of antimicrobial drugs and hygiene practices) that differentiate Westernized and non-Westernized populations are most clearly related to differences in Prevotella prevalence and diversity. Ultimately, the major outstanding question is whether the decreased Prevotella prevalence and diversity observed at the population level in modern industrialized society is a reversible process and whether reversing this trend is indeed desirable from a health perspective. If it is desirable, then studies will be necessary to understand whether individual dietary-induced and lifestyle-induced microbiome alterations are sufficient to restore gut homeostasis or whether direct supplementation of Prevotella diversity would be required.NATure revieWs | Microbiology R e v i e w s 0123456789();: a statistical artefact owing to the use of microbiome profiling methods based on relative abundance as well as a consequence of Prevotella-induced ecological effects.

        <p>Second, it is crucial that future research be directed at unravelling the biomedical relevance of Prevotella spp. Indeed, while their pathogenic potential has proved to be limited and mostly connected with opportunistic infections, the role of Prevotella spp. in the onset and development of immune-mediated diseases remains unclear. Initial reports of a link with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 17 were only partially confirmed by follow-up studies 110,111,116 . The complexity of Prevotella spp. interactions with mucosal immunity 23,178 could explain the involvement of this genus in both autoimmunity and increased protection against pathobionts, and strain-level differences are likely responsible for the variability in immunological phenotypes between individuals, especially in light of the expanded genomic diversity of the P. copri complex 16 . Therefore, studies involving larger cohorts, with longitudinal sampling and accounting for host population differences, immunological aspects and strain-level Prevotella diversity, are needed to clarify this link, which could have a broad translational impact.Second, it is crucial that future research be directed at unravelling the biomedical relevance of Prevotella spp. Indeed, while their pathogenic potential has proved to be limited and mostly connected with opportunistic infections, the role of Prevotella spp. in the onset and development of immune-mediated diseases remains unclear.

        <p>Third, the relationship between intestinal Prevotella spp. and nutrition should receive more research focus. Multiple convincing studies have demonstrated an association between Prevotella spp. and dietary patterns and cardiometabolic health, but such studies often report conflicting results 128,130,[139][140][141][142][143]145,146,148,149 . Again, subspecies and strain diversity may obscure the consistency of experimental outcomes, which argues for improved study designs and larger clinical and preclinical cohorts. Because of the potential to manipulate the gut microbiome, a clear understanding of the role of Prevotella in human metabolism and nutrition might have tremendous clinical applications, such as the development of advanced probiotics and prebiotics, similar to those that are starting to be implemented for other bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila 179 . For this application, efforts to isolate Prevotella strains will be pivotal in the coming years. The possibility to characterize strains, particularly from individuals with different diets and lifestyles, and observe their behaviour in vitro or in animal models will be of utmost importance to clarify the role of Prevotella spp. in health and how effective lifestyle features are in selecting strains with defined attributes.Third, the relationship between intestinal Prevotella spp. and nutrition should receive more research focus. Multiple convincing studies have demonstrated an association between Prevotella spp. and dietary patterns and cardiometabolic health, but such studies often report conflicting results 128,130,[139][140][141][142][143]145,146,148,149 . Again, subspecies and strain diversity may obscure the consistency of experimental outcomes, which argues for improved study designs and larger clinical and preclinical cohorts.

        <p>Intriguingly, these three open questions could be interconnected in one hypothetical scenario. Considering the clear dietary implications of the Westernization process, the link between Prevotella and diet might be driving its decreasing presence in Westernized populations with their fat-rich and fibre-poor diet. Such a changing equilibrium potentially affects the host-Prevotella symbiotic relationship that was established over hundreds of thousands of years of co-evolution, leading in turn to impaired hostmicroorganism interactions that could make the host more prone to disease. This scenario remains for now an unproven hypothesis, but Prevotella seems to be the most promising genus to test this hypothesis.Intriguingly, these three open questions could be interconnected in one hypothetical scenario.
