        <p>A systematic quantitative analysis of temporal changes in host and viral proteins throughout the course of a productive infection could provide dynamic insights into virus-host interaction. We developed a proteomic technique called ''quantitative temporal viromics'' (QTV), which employs multiplexed tandem-mass-tag-based mass spectrometry. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is not only an important pathogen but a paradigm of viral immune evasion. QTV detailed how HCMV orchestrates the expression of &gt;8,000 cellular proteins, including 1,200 cell-surface proteins to manipulate signaling pathways and counterintrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune defenses. QTV predicted natural killer and T cell ligands, as well as 29 viral proteins present at the cell surface, potential therapeutic targets. Temporal profiles of &gt;80% of HCMV canonical genes and 14 noncanonical HCMV open reading frames were defined. QTV is a powerful method that can yield important insights into viral infection and is applicable to any virus with a robust in vitro model.A systematic quantitative analysis of temporal changes in host and viral proteins throughout the course of a productive infection could provide dynamic insights into virus-host interaction.

        <p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that persistently infects the majority of the world's population (Mocarski et al., 2013). Following primary infection, HCMV persists for the lifetime of the host under the control of a healthy immune system (Nichols et al., 2002). Reactivation from viral latency to productive infection in immunocompromised individuals, and acquisition of primary infection in utero or during transplantation can lead to serious disease (Mocarski et al., 2013). With the possibility of CMV being used as a vaccine vector (Hansen et al., 2013), a complete understanding of its ability to modulate host immunity is paramount.Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that persistently infects the majority of the world's population (Mocarski et al., 2013).

        <p>During productive infection, HCMV gene expression is conventionally divided into immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) phases. The IE2 gene is primarily responsible for activating transcription of early-phase genes. By definition, early genes encode functions necessary to initiate viral DNA replication. Early-late genes (E-L) are initially transcribed at low levels and upregulated after the onset of viral DNA replication, whereas true-late genes are expressed exclusively after DNA replication and include proteins required for the assembly and morphogenesis of HCMV virions (Mocarski et al., 2013).During productive infection, HCMV gene expression is conventionally divided into immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L) phases.

        <p>HCMV is a paradigm for viral immune evasion that perturbs the interferon (IFN) response (Powers et al., 2008), suppresses antigen presentation through the efficient downregulation of MHC class I (van der Wal et al., 2002), and has eight or more genes that act to suppress natural killer (NK) cell function (Wilkinson et al., 2008). Nevertheless, our understanding of how HCMV evades and modulates intrinsic immune sensors and effectors during infection remains superficial. It is not known which viral proteins are present at the cell surface, or how viral and host proteins are regulated during infection. Prior analysis of the temporal expression of HCMV genes has relied either on semiquantitative immunoblots of single viral proteins, or microarrays, which cannot capture posttranscriptional change (Ma et al., 2012). Although 604 noncanonical HCMV open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified by ribosomal footprinting (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012), it is not yet clear how many of these ORFs encode functional polypeptides. Answering such questions has the potential to reveal mechanisms of immune evasion, cell-surface drug targets, and an improved understanding of HCMV biology.HCMV is a paradigm for viral immune evasion that perturbs the interferon (IFN) response (Powers et al., 2008), suppresses antigen presentation through the efficient downregulation of MHC class I (van der Wal et al., 2002), and has eight or more genes that act to suppress natural killer (NK) cell function (Wilkinson et al., 2008).

        <p>In this paper, we describe a proteomic approach to study viral infection (quantitative temporal viromics, QTV), based on precise temporal quantitation of plasma membrane (PM) and intracellular proteins. We combined plasma membrane profiling, our recently described method for isolation of highly purified PM proteins for proteomic analysis (Weekes et al., 2012), with study of whole-cell lysates (WCL). We quantified proteins from up to ten samples using isobaric chemical tags (tandem mass tags, TMT) (McAlister et al., 2012) and MS3 mass spectrometry. This utilizes two consecutive peptide fragmentation steps to liberate TMT reporters, minimizing interference from coisolated ions and enabling uniquely precise quantitative measurement of protein abundances at a near-global proteomic scale (Ting et al., 2011). We quantified &gt;8,000 proteins including 1,184 cell-surface proteins and 81% of all canonical HCMV proteins over eight time points during productive infection, providing a near-complete temporal view of the host proteome and HCMV virome. Quantitative temporal viromics provides a framework for the study of any virus, enabling in-depth analysis of key aspects of viral pathogenesis.In this paper, we describe a proteomic approach to study viral infection (quantitative temporal viromics, QTV), based on precise temporal quantitation of plasma membrane (PM) and intracellular proteins.

        <p>We infected primary human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFFs) with HCMV strain Merlin and initially used 8-plex TMT to quantify changes in PM protein expression. We assessed in biological duplicate three of the reference time points in productive HCMV infection and mock infection (experiment ''PM1'', Figure 1A). We quantified 927 PM proteins (Figure S1A available online). Surprisingly, 56% of proteins changed &gt;2-fold and 33% &gt;3-fold by 72 hr of infection. Replicates clustered tightly (Figure 1B).

        <p>We previously demonstrated that HCMV protein UL138 degrades the cell-surface ABC transporter Multidrug Resistanceassociated Protein-1 (ABCC1) in both productive and latent infections and showed that the ABCC1-specific cytotoxic substrate Vincristine could be used therapeutically to eliminate cells latently infected with HCMV (Weekes et al., 2013). To validate findings in this present study of productive infection, we examined all quantified ABC transporters and found selective downregulation of ABCC1 as well as ABCC3 (Figure 1C). The ABCC3 drug transporter might represent an additional therapeutic target.We previously demonstrated that HCMV protein UL138 degrades the cell-surface ABC transporter Multidrug Resistanceassociated Protein-1 (ABCC1) in both productive and latent infections and showed that the ABCC1-specific cytotoxic substrate Vincristine could be used therapeutically to eliminate cells latently infected with HCMV (Weekes et al., 2013).

        <p>We further validated our results by comparison to all PM proteins that exhibit reported changes during productive HCMV infection in fibroblasts. We observed expected changes in 21/ 22 cellular proteins (Table S1A; Figure S1B) and detected six of six previously reported HCMV proteins at the PM. Five of these are virion envelope glycoproteins expressed late in infection (Figure 1D).We further validated our results by comparison to all PM proteins that exhibit reported changes during productive HCMV infection in fibroblasts.

        <p>Temporal analysis of whole-cell lysates (WCLs) of HCMVinfected HFFFs enables the study of changes in expression of all proteins during infection and a comparison of the total abundance of a given protein to its expression at the PM. By analyzing WCL of HFFF infected simultaneously with PM samples, we again saw a high degree of reproducibility among biological replicates (experiment WCL1, Figures 1E andS1C) and confirmed changes in 31/35 previously reported proteins (Table S1B). We further validated our findings by comparison to a high-throughput western blot analysis of cells infected with Toledo strain of HCMV (Stanton et al., 2007) and saw a strong association between protein changes in both experiments (p &lt; 0.0001, Fisher's exact test, Table S1C).Temporal analysis of whole-cell lysates (WCLs) of HCMVinfected HFFFs enables the study of changes in expression of all proteins during infection and a comparison of the total abundance of a given protein to its expression at the PM.

        <p>To gain a more detailed view of changes in the host cell proteome and HCMV virome over the course of a productive infection, and to focus on events early in infection such as the IFN response, we used 10-plex TMT (McAlister et al., 2012). We analyzed productively infected HFFFs at seven time points, plus a duplicate mock infection (Figure S1D). For the tenth sample, we analyzed 12 hr infection with irradiated virus, in which viral DNA is inactivated, allowing for infection but preventing viral gene expression (Sullivan et al., 1971). Comparison of early productive infection and infection with irradiated virus allowed us to dissect the contribution of the virion to changes in the cellular proteome.To gain a more detailed view of changes in the host cell proteome and HCMV virome over the course of a productive infection, and to focus on events early in infection such as the IFN response, we used 10-plex TMT (McAlister et al., 2012).

        <p>We quantified 1,184 PM proteins (experiment PM2, Figure S1E) and 7,491 cellular proteins (experiment WCL2, Figure 2A). Protein temporal profiles correlated well between repeat time courses (Figures 1F and S1F).

        <p>Antiviral IFN effects are conferred by interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) products that target different stages of virus replication and include known herpesvirus restriction factors Viperin and IFI16 (Gariano et al., 2012). HCMV infection triggers expression of ISG, which the virus counters by impairing the IFN signaling pathway, degrading the double-stranded RNA sensor RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and ''repurposing'' ISGs such as Tetherin to enhance rather than restrict viral replication (reviewed in Amsler et al., 2013). The temporal effects of these strategies on ISG protein expression are poorly understood as are the HCMV proteins responsible, although the immediate early proteins IE1 and IE2 and the apoptosis inhibitory protein vMIA have been implicated (Amsler et al., 2013).Antiviral IFN effects are conferred by interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) products that target different stages of virus replication and include known herpesvirus restriction factors Viperin and IFI16 (Gariano et al., 2012).

        <p>One cluster of 40 proteins from experiment WCL2 (cluster A) exhibited striking upregulation at 6 and 12 hr after infection, followed by rapid return to near-basal levels (Figures 2A and2B). Fourteen were viral proteins, and 26/40 were human, of which 85% are already known to be interferon responsive. Seventythree percent of these proteins are additionally known to have antiviral function (Table S3A).One cluster of 40 proteins from experiment WCL2 (cluster A) exhibited striking upregulation at 6 and 12 hr after infection, followed by rapid return to near-basal levels (Figures 2A and2B).

        <p>We therefore performed a comprehensive search of all other known interferon-induced antiviral genes, to determine which might be similarly or otherwise modulated during HCMV infection (Duggal and Emerman, 2012;Schoggins et al., 2011). Our results were consistent with the reported degradation of RIG-I and of the nuclear HCMV restriction factor Sp100 during infection (Figures 2A andS2A, respectively) (Kim et al., 2011a;Scott, 2009). Many of the tripartite motif-containing proteins (TRIMs) are interferon induced. TRIM5a can restrict HIV, although no viral factor is yet known to antagonize its expression (Rahm and Telenti, 2012). We quantified 21 TRIMs, of which TRIM 5, 16, 22, and 38 were downregulated during infection (Figure S2B). SAM Domain and HD Domain 1 (SAMHD1), zinc finger CCCH-type, antiviral 1 (ZAP/ZC3HAV1), and the novel anti-HIV factor Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) behaved similarly to members of cluster A (Figure S2A). It remains to be determined whether any of these antiviral proteins can restrict HCMV, and if reduction in their expression simply reflects diminished IFN signaling and response, or selective targeting by virus.We therefore performed a comprehensive search of all other known interferon-induced antiviral genes, to determine which might be similarly or otherwise modulated during HCMV infection (Duggal and Emerman, 2012;Schoggins et al., 2011).

        <p>The relative contribution to ISG expression of active HCMV transcription (sensed, for example, by RIG-I) and viral binding to pattern recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptor 2) is poorly understood (Paludan et al., 2011). We identified a group of 84 proteins significantly upregulated during productive infection, of which only 20% were &gt;2-fold upregulated by irradiated virus (Figure 2C; Table S3B). The 84 proteins include 25/26 human proteins from cluster A, and 39% are known to be upregulated by IFN. Transcriptionally active HCMV may thus play an important role in ISG induction.The relative contribution to ISG expression of active HCMV transcription (sensed, for example, by RIG-I) and viral binding to pattern recognition receptors (such as Toll-like receptor 2) is poorly understood (Paludan et al., 2011).

        <p>The activity of a signaling pathway can be modulated either by posttranslational modification, or regulation of expression of a pathway member. Changes in protein expression can be quantified by QTV. We have shown that after an initial activation, the expression of ISG is rapidly reduced during HCMV infection, but how is this achieved? We quantified 13/15 key members of IFN induction and signaling pathways (Figure 3A, reviewed in Amsler et al., 2013). We confirmed known effects of HCMV infection on Jak1, STAT2, and IRF9 (Le et al., 2008) and demonstrated that, apart from STAT1, expression of the final effectors in both interferon induction and response pathways were all progres-sively diminished during infection (Figure 3A). An effect of HCMV infection on IRF3 has not previously been reported.The activity of a signaling pathway can be modulated either by posttranslational modification, or regulation of expression of a pathway member.

For each protein, signal:noise from the 12 hr irradiated virus or productive infection samples, and both mock samples was normalized to 1. The order of samples mock 1 and mock 2 was randomized into mock (a) and mock (b). The difference in normalized signal:noise was then calculated as indicated, and histograms were plotted. Where &lt;0.05% of proteins were upregulated by infection with irradiated virus, 2% of proteins were upregulated by infection with live virus. These included 69 viral proteins and 84 human proteins, of which 39% are known ISGs.

        <p>profiles. We clustered all 7,491 proteins from experiment WCL2 and 1,184 proteins from PM2 into three classes (corresponding to upregulation, downregulation, and no change) to identify novel pathways dysregulated during HCMV infection (Figure 3B). We then applied 
            <rs type="software">DAVID</rs> software (Huang et al., 2009) to determine which KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways were enriched in each class (Figures 3C andS3A). We made the discovery that multiple members of the TLR signaling pathway were downregulated (Figures S3A and S3B; Table S4A), suggesting that HCMV might employ a number of strategies to avoid this intrinsic immune mechanism. Fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated during infection (Figure 3C; Table S4A), corresponding to published literature (Koyuncu et al., 2013). A lack of gap junction intercellular communication is common in cancer, and is thought to enable escape of homeostatic control. Gap junction alpha-1 protein (GJA1) modulates the expression of many genes involved in cell-cycle control and tumorigenesis and is degraded by HCMV IE1 and IE2 (Khan et al., 2014;Stanton et al., 2007). We confirmed GJA1 S4.

        <p>The KEGG pathways ''colorectal cancer'' and ''pathways in cancer'' were enriched in the downregulated PM cluster and included Frizzled receptors FZD1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and signaling protein WNT5a, all key members of the wnt pathway. We additionally discovered downregulation of the canonical wnt pathway coreceptors LRP5 and 6, and of noncanonical receptors ROR1, ROR2, RYK, and PTK7. Overall, 11/13 quantified wnt receptors were downmodulated (Figure S3D). Diminished transcription of wnt target genes and increased degradation of the key wnt mediator b-catenin have been reported in HCMV infection; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear (Angelova et al., 2012). Our discovery of downregulation of the majority of all wnt receptors suggests that diminished basal signaling from the cell surface may lead to increased proteasomal b-catenin degradation. Multiple effects on different cell-surface receptors suggest that the modulation of this signaling pathway may be of paramount importance to HCMV.The KEGG pathways ''colorectal cancer'' and ''pathways in cancer'' were enriched in the downregulated PM cluster and included Frizzled receptors FZD1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 and signaling protein WNT5a, all key members of the wnt pathway.

        <p>In order to expand our search, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on the average k-means profiles for up-and downregulated WCL clusters (Figure 3B) (Subramanian et al., 2005). GSEA can increase the power to detect enrichment because it scores pathways based on similarity of protein members to a prototypic profile, as opposed to determining enrichment within a large group of proteins with broadly similar profiles. Multiple mitochondrial metabolic and biosynthetic pathways were significantly upregulated and confirmed the changes we observed in fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Transcription and export of mRNA was upregulated. Downregulated pathways included Robo receptor signaling, important in cell proliferation and motility, and ERBB and VEGFR signaling (Table S4B).In order to expand our search, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based on the average k-means profiles for up-and downregulated WCL clusters (Figure 3B) (Subramanian et al., 2005).

        <p>We mined our data for all known NK cell ligands (Vivier et al., 2008) and discovered previously unrecognized modulation of six ligands during HCMV infection. E-cadherin (CDH1), the ligand for the inhibitory NK receptor KLRG-1 (killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1), was dramatically upregulated during infection. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and B7-H6, ligands for activating NK receptors a4b1 integrin and NKp30, were downregulated (Figure 4A). Interestingly, other known ligands including collagen I (COL1A1 and COL1A2), collagen III (COL3A1), cell adhesion molecule-1 (CADM1), and poliovirus receptor-related 1 (PVRL1) were expressed in a manner that would be expected for an appropriate response to intracellular infection (Figure 4A; Table S2).We mined our data for all known NK cell ligands (Vivier et al., 2008) and discovered previously unrecognized modulation of six ligands during HCMV infection.

        <p>We performed a similar screen for all known ab T cell costimulatory molecules, and gd T cell ligands (Bonneville et al., 2010;Hubo et al., 2013). The T cell costimulators ICOSLG (inducible T cell costimulator ligand) and PD-L2 were downregulated during infection, as was butyrophilin subfamily 3 member A1 (BTN3A1), recently shown to present phosphoantigens to Vg9Vd2 + T cells (Vavassori et al., 2013). V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA, C10Orf54), a novel B7 family inhibitory ligand (Ceeraz et al., 2013) was upregulated late in infection (Figure 4B).We performed a similar screen for all known ab T cell costimulatory molecules, and gd T cell ligands (Bonneville et al., 2010;Hubo et al., 2013).

        <p>NK and T cell ligands belong to a few key protein families, including cadherins, C-type lectins, immunoglobulin, TNF receptor, and major histocompatibility-complex-related molecules (Vivier et al., 2008). In order to discover immunomodulating proteins, we added InterPro functional domain annotations to data from experiments PM1 and PM2 (Hunter et al., 2012) and reasoned that modulation of a ligand during HCMV infection may indicate biological importance. Seventy-four proteins had a relevant InterPro annotation and at least a 4-fold change compared to mock infection (Table S5A; Data S1). Eight downregulated proteins were protocadherins. Examining all quantified proteins in this family, we found that six of six g-protocadherins were particularly potently downregulated (Figure 4C). The protocadherins may therefore represent a major set of immunomodulators.NK and T cell ligands belong to a few key protein families, including cadherins, C-type lectins, immunoglobulin, TNF receptor, and major histocompatibility-complex-related molecules (Vivier et al., 2008).

        <p>We confirmed temporal profiles of protocadherins PCDHgC3 and FAT1 in addition to eight other cell-surface proteins by flow cytometry and immunoblot (Figures 4D andS4A, S4C, andS4E). To provide proof-of-principle validation of our functional predictions, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of the C-type lectin CLEC1A (Table S5A), which is downregulated 7-fold by HCMV and is a potential NK ligand by homology to CLEC2D.

        <p>There is increasing evidence for a substantial role of plexinsemaphorin signaling in the immune system (Takamatsu and Kumanogoh, 2012). For example, secreted class III semapohrins bind plexins A and D1 to regulate migration of dendritic cells to secondary lymphoid organs. Plexin B2 interacts with membrane-bound semaphorin 4D to promote epidermal gd T cell activation (Witherden et al., 2012). HCMV infection substantially downregulated five of the nine plexins: A1, A3, B1, B2, and D1. Intriguingly, neuropilin 2, a plexin coreceptor was also rapidly downregulated. Semaphorin 4D was dramatically upregulated and 4C downregulated, suggesting that viral interaction with these ligands is complex (Table S5A; Data S1).There is increasing evidence for a substantial role of plexinsemaphorin signaling in the immune system (Takamatsu and Kumanogoh, 2012).

            <rs type="software">DAVID</rs> software (Huang et al., 2009). The Interpro categories ''protocadherin gamma'' and ''immunoglobulin-like fold'' were significantly enriched in addition to Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes ''regulation of leukocyte activation'' and ''positive regulation of cell motion,'' suggesting a negative effect of HCMV on cell motility.

We observed striking downregulation of ephrins B1 and B2 as well as all three of their quantified B-class ephrin receptors (Data S1). Downstream effects of forward or reverse ephrin signaling include changes in cell adhesion, shape, and motility, and there is evidence for a role of ephrin B2 in murine T cell costimulation (Nikolov et al., 2013), suggesting that downregulation of this pathway may represent another mechanism of immune evasion.Within the category ''regulation of leukocyte activation,'' ephrin B1 was downregulated, and we therefore examined all ephrins and their receptors.

        <p>Most prior studies of the temporal expression of canonical HCMV proteins have employed immunoblots at only one or a few time points. Comparison between different reports has been complicated by lack of specific antibodies and study-tostudy variation in the HCMV strain used, with laboratory-adapted strains AD169 and Towne (which lack a large number of ORFs as a result of extensive passage in vitro) often used in preference to isolates containing a complete genome (Ma et al., 2012). We were able to quantify the temporal expression of the majority (139/171) of the canonical HCMV proteins as well as 14 noncanonical ORFs; most of these proteins were quantified in a single experiment (Figure 5, plots for all quantified viral proteins in Data S1).Most prior studies of the temporal expression of canonical HCMV proteins have employed immunoblots at only one or a few time points.

        <p>IE/E/E-L/L cascades are functionally defined by the use of metabolic inhibitors. IE transcripts accumulate in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor such as cycloheximide.

        <p>A complementary method of classification would be to group viral proteins according to their temporal profiles. Use of the k-means method with four classes suggested that HCMV protein profiles grouped similarly to the recognized functional cascades IE/E/E-L/L (Figure 5A). We performed k-means clustering with 2 to 14 classes and assessed the summed distance of each protein from its cluster centroid. Although this summed distance necessarily becomes smaller as more clusters are added, the rate of decline decreases with each added group, eventually settling at a fairly constant rate of decline that reflects overfitting; clusters added prior to this point reflect underlying structure in the temporal protein data, whereas clusters subsequently added through overfitting are not informative. The point of inflexion fell between five and seven classes, suggesting that there are at least five distinct temporal protein (Tp) profiles of viral protein expression (Figures 5A-5D). We term these classes Tp1, Tp2, Tp3, Tp4, and Tp5. There was generally good correspondence between classical functional and protein temporal classes, for example, the known L proteins UL99, UL94, UL75, UL115, and UL32 all classified as Tp5 (Omoto and Mocarski, 2014). A cluster of 13 proteins that we call Tp4 exhibited a distinct profile to Tp3 and Tp5, with maximal expression at 48 hr and low expression at other time points (Figures 5C and5D). Members of this cluster predominantly originated from two regions of the viral genome (Table S6A).A complementary method of classification would be to group viral proteins according to their temporal profiles.

        <p>To directly compare classical functional and protein temporal classes, we performed WCL analysis in the presence or absence of the viral DNA replication inhibitor PFA (experiment WCL3,Figures 5C and 5D;Table S2; plots for all quantified viral proteins in Data S1). Expression of 48/55 Tp5-class proteins was completely or almost completely inhibited by PFA. Tp3 and Tp4 proteins were generally partially inhibited, with little effect on Tp1 or Tp2.

        <p>We were unable to confidently resolve the profile of UL122 (IE2). UL122 and UL123 are expressed by alternative splicing of a single major immediate-early transcript. Exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 encode UL123 and exons 1, 2, 3, and 5 encode UL122; however, additional transcripts have also been detected from the region of exon 5 (Stenberg et al., 1989;Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012). We examined each peptide quantified from every exon (Figure S5A). The profiles of all peptides from exon 4 peaked at 18-24 hr, corresponding to the predicted expression of UL123 protein. The profiles of ten exon 5 peptides corresponding to the late-expressed internal ORF, ORFL265C.iORF1 (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012) peaked at 96 hr. A single peptide N-terminal to this ORF that is likely to originate from UL122 had a distinct profile with expression from 6 hr that peaked at 48 hr, similar to UL122 mRNA (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012). This suggests the existence of at least two proteins arising wholly or in part from exon 5 and corresponds to the detection of an abundant late 40 kDa protein, previously detected from the same internal exon 5 ORF of AD169 strain (Stenberg et al., 1989). It is likely that ORFL265C.iORF1 protein is more abundant than UL122, effectively masking the earlier signal from most UL122 exon 5 peptides.

        <p>We detected a total of 67 viral proteins in experiments PM1 and PM2. Plasma membrane profiling provides a very substantial enrichment for PM glycoproteins (up to 90% of proteins from unfractionated samples, and approximately 60% of proteins from fractionated samples have indicative Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure S1A) (Weekes et al., 2012). Subcellular localization of viral proteins is, however, poorly annotated, making it difficult to determine which might be non-PM contaminants, such as abundant viral tegument and nuclear proteins. We therefore developed a filtering strategy: for every GO-annotated human protein quantified in experiment PM1 or PM2 (Figure S1A), we calculated the ratio of peptides (experiments PM1 + PM2)/(experiments WCL1+WCL2). Ninety-two percent of proteins that were GO-defined non-PM had a ratio of &lt;1.4; 88% of human proteins scoring above 1.4 were annotated as PM proteins, demonstrating the predictive value of this metric (Figure 6A).

        <p>In general, we observed a striking correlation between the PM2 and WCL2 temporal profiles of all 29 high-confidence proteins. For the subset of known virion envelope glycoproteins (Varnum et al., 2004), protein expression at the PM was significantly later than in WCL, confirmed by analysis of the same proteins from experiments PM1 and WCL1 (Figures 6B andS6). This may reflect assembly of the HCMV virion within the viral cyto-plasmic assembly compartment prior to viral egress (Alwine, 2012) and demonstrates that QTV can additionally provide insights into aspects of the viral life cycle. PM appearance of UL119 was similarly delayed, suggesting that this known virion glycoprotein may be a component of the virion envelope. The sensitivity of MS3 TMT-based mass spectrometry is suggested by our apparent quantitation of binding or fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane; there was a small early peak in PM presence of most virion envelope glycoproteins at 6 hr of infection that disappeared by 12 hr (Figure 6B).In general, we observed a striking correlation between the PM2 and WCL2 temporal profiles of all 29 high-confidence proteins.

        <p>We have previously shown that HCMV UL141 retains the poliovirus receptor (PVR) in the endoplasmic reticulum, inhibiting cell-surface expression and preventing interaction with activating NK receptor DNAM-1. Intracellular PVR accumulates during HCMV infection. In contrast, a second DNAM-1 ligand poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2) is targeted for proteasomal degradation by UL141 acting with other HCMV gene(s) (Prod 'homme et al., 2010;Tomasec et al., 2005). QTV confirmed these results; we observed rapid depletion of PVR from the plasma membrane, in contrast to its accumulation within WCL. PVRL2 was lost from both PM and WCLs (Figure 7).

        <p>The activating receptor NKG2D is expressed on a variety of immune effector cells and recognizes major histocompatibility complex class I-related ligands MICA, MICB, and ULBP1-3. HCMV infection strongly induces transcription of MICB, ULBP1, and ULBP2 mRNA but prevents their surface expression by intracellular sequestration with HCMV UL16 (Dunn et al., 2003a).

Simultaneous study of protein expression at the cell surface and in whole-cell lysates has revealed insights into many aspects of the viral life cycle. To be able to persist in an infected individual lifelong, herpesviruses have developed a wealth of strategies to modulate innate and adaptive immunity. One benefit is that we can use HCMV infection to discover proteins important in host defense, as viral modulation of protein expression generally reflects biological imperative. We often observed modulation of multiple members of the same protein family, increasing the likelihood of biological relevance; for example, six of six g-protocadherins that are downregulated during infection may be novel NK ligands in addition to protocadherin FAT1. The correspondence in temporal profiles of proteins in cluster A (Figure 2A) enables prediction of IFN-stimulated genes, which might additionally have antiviral function. Multiple signaling pathways were modulated by HCMV, which has the potential to inform not only viral interaction networks by predicting effects on pathway target genes but improves our knowledge of the metabolic changes necessary to effect viral replication (Koyuncu et al., 2013). GSEA provides a particularly useful overview of many of the pathways and receptors changing significantly in our data.In this study, we provide a comprehensive resource describing temporal changes in viral and host proteomes during infection with HCMV.

        <p>The temporal quantitation of &gt;80% of canonical HCMV proteins in one experiment provides a significant technical advance. Our knowledge of HCMV protein profiles has so far relied on a literature complicated by the use of multiple different laboratory-adapted viral strains, different cell types, and variable infection conditions (Ma et al., 2012). Many have not previously been quantified. We provide a temporal system of classification of HCMV protein expression using the prototype clinical strain Merlin, which is complementary to and consistent with the functionally derived classical IE/E/E-L/L nomenclature. For example, expression of 87% of proteins we define as Tp5 was prevented by the viral DNA replication inhibitor PFA. These data suggest that the classical ''true late'' category of transcripts could be substantially expanded. Furthermore, all capsid proteins we quantified (Mocarski et al., 2013) belonged to class Tp5, whereas viral tegument proteins were more diverse: of 27 quantified, three were Tp1, 2 Tp2, 8 Tp3, and 14 Tp5, suggesting that these proteins may additionally have nonstructural roles such as regulation of gene expression and immune evasion. It remains to be seen whether Tp4 proteins have a distinct function that requires peak expression at 48 hr of infection, for example, preparation of the cell for virus release via inhibition of neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity (RL11 family), or promoting viral egress and cell-cell spread (Table S5A). Particular advantages to our temporal measurements include the ability to correlate viral and cellular protein expression, narrowing the field of viral proteins possiblyThe temporal quantitation of &gt;80% of canonical HCMV proteins in one experiment provides a significant technical advance.

        <p>In their recent ribosomal profiling (RP) analysis of HCMV, Stern-Ginossar et al. ( 2012) identified 147/171 canonical genes. We quantified 139/171 proteins (Table S2), notably including 15 genes not detected by RP. Proteins UL1 and UL6 were quantified at the PM but not in WCL samples suggesting that overall abundance of both mRNA and protein might be low. It is unclear why RP failed to detect the 13 remaining proteins, which in several cases we quantified by abundant peptides. It is likely that the sensitivity of QTV for low-abundant proteins will be further increased with the next generation of Orbitrap mass spectrometers, enabling an even more comprehensive coverage of both HCMV and human proteomes. For example, analysis of experiment WCL3 using the new Orbitrap Fusion enabled quantitation of five noncanonical ORFs we previously did not detect. Even with this sensitive instrument, it is still possible that we were unable to detect very low-abundant proteins, which may explain why some studies have detected viral transcripts earlier in infection that our protein measurements suggest. An increase in proteome coverage will also improve our ability to distinguish protein isoforms, which complicated our quantitation of UL122.In their recent ribosomal profiling (RP) analysis of HCMV, Stern-Ginossar et al.

        <p>With an increasing frequency of transplantation and emergence of drug resistance, novel strategies are required to treat HCMV infection. QTV provides evidence for up to 29 cell-surface viral glycoproteins that can now be assessed as targets for therapeutic monoclonal or bispecific antibodies, to stimulate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or deliver a cytotoxin. Strongly upregulated PM proteins may constitute alternative antibody targets. By directing treatment toward proteins expressed early in infection, it may be possible to eliminate infected cells prior to the release of infectious virus. The efficacy and safety of such an approach is suggested by small-scale treatment of patients with severe drug-resistant HCMV disease using pooled immunoglobulin selected for high antibody titers to HCMV (Alexander et al., 2010). QTV has demonstrated great utility in being able to identify and quantify the regulation of virus and host proteins on the cell surface without requirement for specific antibodies. Clearly, the cell-surface viral proteins we describe require validation using an independent approach once reagents are available.With an increasing frequency of transplantation and emergence of drug resistance, novel strategies are required to treat HCMV infection.

        <p>Protein Isolation and Peptide Labeling with Tandem Mass Tags Plasma membrane profiling was performed as described previously (Weekes et al., 2012). One hundred percent of each peptide sample was labeled with TMT reagent, and six fractions were generated from combined peptide samples by tip-based strong cation exchange. For whole-proteome analysis, cells were lysed and protein was reduced and then alkylated. Protein was digested with LysC (experiment 1) or LysC and then Trypsin (experiments 2 and 3). Peptides were labeled with TMT reagent, and 12 fractions were generated by high-pH reverse-phase HPLC.Protein Isolation and Peptide Labeling with Tandem Mass Tags Plasma membrane profiling was performed as described previously (Weekes et al., 2012).

        <p>A combined database was searched, consisting of (1) human Uniprot, (2) Merlin strain HCMV Uniprot, and (3) all additional noncanonical HCMV ORFs (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012). Peptide-spectral matches were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) using linear discriminant analysis in conjunction with the target-decoy method (Huttlin et al., 2010). The resulting data set was further collapsed to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. Protein assembly was guided by principles of parsimony. Where all PSM from a given HCMV protein could be explained either by a canonical gene or noncanonical ORF, the canonical gene was picked in preference. Proteins were quantified by summing TMT reporter ion counts across all matching PSM after filtering based on isolation specificity (Pease et al., 2013). Reverse and contaminant proteins were removed, and protein quantitation values were exported for normalization and further analysis in
