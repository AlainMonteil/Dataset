        <p>Background. Few pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 have been reported and we know little about the epidemiology in children, although more is known about other coronaviruses. We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in order to inform clinical and public health measures.Background.

We aimed to understand the infection rate, clinical presentation, clinical outcomes, and transmission dynamics for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in order to inform clinical and public health measures.</p>
        <p>Methods. We undertook a rapid systematic review and narrative synthesis of all literature relating to SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric populations. The search terms also included SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We searched 3 databases and the COVID-19 resource centers of 11 major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese-language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted.Methods.

We searched 3 databases and the COVID-19 resource centers of 11 major journals and publishers. English abstracts of Chinese-language papers were included. Data were extracted and narrative syntheses conducted.</p>
        <p>Results. Twenty-four studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review. Children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of cases in large epidemiological studies. Limited data on attack rate indicate that children are just as susceptible to infection. Data on clinical outcomes are scarce but include several reports of asymptomatic infection and a milder course of disease in young children, although radiological abnormalities are noted. Severe cases are not reported in detail and there are few data relating to transmission.Results. Twenty-four studies relating to COVID-19 were included in the review.

        <p>Conclusions. Children appear to have a low observed case rate of COVID-19 but may have rates similar to adults of infection with SARS-CoV-2. This discrepancy may be because children are asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention and be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19.Conclusions.

        <p>In December 2019, reports emerged of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China, culminating in the identification of a novel coronavirus on 12 January 2020, denoted as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1]. The virus spread rapidly around the world and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 [2], with many countries adopting unprecedented public health measures to curb its spread.In December 2019, reports emerged of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China, culminating in the identification of a novel coronavirus on 12 January 2020, denoted as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1].

        <p>Coronaviruses are large, lipid-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses found in avian and mammalian species. Human coronaviruses commonly cause mild upper respiratory tract infections, accounting for approximately 30% of common colds, although instances of severe disease are described in the elderly, children, and immunocompromised hosts [3]. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, there are 2 other notable exceptions: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). An epidemic of SARS-CoV in 2003 affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths [4]. MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 and is now endemic at low levels in the Persian Gulf region, with notable nosocomial outbreaks but otherwise limited human-human transmission [5]. As of 19 November 2019, WHO has reported 2494 cases and 858 deaths [5]. The respective R 0 values for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (outside nosocomial outbreaks) are 3 [4], &lt;1 [6], and 2-3 [7].Coronaviruses are large, lipid-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses found in avian and mammalian species.

        <p>Social-distancing policies have been widely adopted in many countries to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2, at great economic and social cost. Social-distancing policies that apply to children, such as school closures, may have an important role in mitigating the spread of pandemics; for many infectious diseases, such as influenza, children are known to drive transmission in households and communities. However, early reports of SARS-CoV-2 [1], as well as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, suggest that children are less likely to be infected and to develop serious disease compared with adults.Social-distancing policies have been widely adopted in many countries to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2, at great economic and social cost.

        <p>Inclusion criteria were any study or article that included information about infection risk, transmission, or severity in children (aged &lt;18 years) for SARS-CoV-2. All types of studies and countries of origin were eligible for inclusion. Our broader search also identified papers relating to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, to allow for informative comparison, although this was not the focus of the review. We excluded articles that exclusively reported data on adults or other respiratory viruses, that did not relate to the clinical or epidemiological aspects of interest, and that were not written in the English language. Eight reviewers extracted data on infection risk, transmission, and clinical presentation and outcomes into a cloud-based spreadsheet (Google Sheets). We also recorded the case definition, the type of study or report, and important limitations, although quality was not formally assessed, and findings were synthesized narratively. As this was a rapid review, each paper was reviewed by one reviewer.Inclusion criteria were any study or article that included information about infection risk, transmission, or severity in children (aged &lt;18 years) for SARS-CoV-2.

        <p>Children are affected by COVID-19, but extant data (largely case series from China) suggest they are less likely to be affected than adults. A national analysis of the first 72 314 cases in China was reported up to 11 February 2020. Cases included 61.8% laboratory-confirmed, 22.4% suspected, 14.6% clinically diagnosed, and 1.2% asymptomatic cases. They reported 419 cases (0.9% of all cases) in children 0-9 years old and 549 (1.2%) in children aged 10-19 years old. A case series of all 1212 confirmed cases in Henan province, China, from 24 January 2020 to 14 February 2020, reported a similarly low proportion of affected children [8]. Among cases with data on age (n = 1156), 24 (2.1%) cases were in children aged 0-10 years old and 31 cases (2.7%) in children aged 11-20 years old. The youngest patient identified was 28 days old, with several cases reported in neonates [9]. The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 [7] concludes that "we cannot determine the extent of infection among children, what role children play in transmission, whether children are less susceptible or whether they simply present differently.

        <p>In an early epidemiological analysis of 507 COVID-19 cases, mainly from China, 13 (2.6%) were younger than 15 years, and the relative risk of COVID-19 in children was less than 0.5 compared with the population average [10]. In contrast, a follow-up study of 1286 close contacts of 391 confirmed cases reported in Shenzhen province, China, reported an infection rate (7.4%) in children under 10 years of age (n = 148) and aged 11-19 years (7.1%) (n = 84) similar to the population average (7.9%). The close-contact cases among children were less likely to be severe and less likely to present with fever compared with adults, demonstrating how milder clinical presentation may lead to undercounting of cases [11].In an early epidemiological analysis of 507 COVID-19 cases, mainly from China, 13 (2.6%) were younger than 15 years, and the relative risk of COVID-19 in children was less than 0.5 compared with the population average [10].

        <p>The Joint Mission consisted of 25 national and international experts over a 9-day period and included workshops and visits to regions around China. Likelihood of infection: A low attack rate in children was presented (2.4% of all cases). In the absence of serological studies, it is not possible to determine the extent of infection among children. Transmission: Asymptomatic transmission exists (but example given was adult giving it to their child and to their parent). Family clusters were the major body of patients, with transmission along 3 generations within some families (although direction of transmission not specified). report [14] of a familial cluster in China, an asymptomatic 10-yearold boy was screened as part of the family cluster and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed radiological ground-glass lung opacities. In Singapore, a well 6-month-old infant with COVID-19 and high viral load was detected as part of a cluster and was also asymptomatic throughout admission [16]. Asymptomatic cases are also reported in the English abstract of a Chinese paper, which reports clinical data and CT chest images of 15 children (aged 4-14 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Five children were febrile and 10 asymptomatic on first visit. The abstract reports radiological changes that are difficult to interpret: "For their first chest CT images, six patients had no lesions, while nine patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and two cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found" [17].The Joint Mission consisted of 25 national and international experts over a 9-day period and included workshops and visits to regions around China.

        <p>While most symptomatic cases in children are described as mild, severe cases of the disease have been reported. The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 stated that 2.5% of the cases among those under 19 years old were severe and 0.2% were critical [7]. Among the 105 children admitted to Wuhan's Children's Hospital, the sole hospital for treating COVID-19 in children in Wuhan, 8 (7.6%) were reported to have severe disease [18]. Among the large analysis of 72 314 cases from China, there were no deaths reported among the 416 reported cases in children aged 1-9 years and a single death among the 549 cases in children aged 10-19 years.

        <p>There is a suggestion that children with underlying conditions are at greater risk of infection or more severe disease, although the evidence is limited and mixed. Among 31 pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 (12 asymptomatic and 19 described as mild) outside Wuhan, only 2 were reported to have underlying conditions (1 had asthma, 1 had a duplicate kidney) [20]. Among a series of 20 pediatric patients treated at Wuhan Children's Hospital, 7 were reported as having underlying conditions, although these were not specified [21]. There were no data on underlying conditions from the larger cases series of children from Wuhan Children's Hospital (n = 105) [18]. While underlying conditions were noted to be an important risk factor in the overall population (particularly respiratory and cardiovascular disease), no pediatric-specific data on underlying conditions were presented in the major analyses of Chinese data [7,19].There is a suggestion that children with underlying conditions are at greater risk of infection or more severe disease, although the evidence is limited and mixed.

        <p>There is limited evidence relating to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children. Many of the childhood cases are from familial clusters, with the children tending to be identified through contact tracing of adult cases [6,9,21,22]. While people interviewed by the WHO-China Joint Mission could not recall episodes of a child infecting an adult (or another child) [7], there has subsequently been 1 clinical report of probable transmission from a 3-month-old infant to her parents. Both parents developed symptomatic COVID-19 days after they looked after the sick infant without personal protective measures [12].There is limited evidence relating to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children.

        <p>In this study we have reviewed the early data on the likelihood of infection, clinical presentation and outcomes, and transmission of COVID-19 in children. The majority of data were from China and may be subject to ascertainment bias, either due to a higher-than-known proportion of milder cases in both adults and children or due to selective ascertainment and testing bias towards adults with acute respiratory symptoms and limitations in diagnostic capacity. A number of the studies examined are preprints and have not been subjected to peer review. Nevertheless, we identify that children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults by observed rate of infection; while 17.8% of the population were aged 0-15 years old, only 2.1% of reported cases in a large case series from China were in the 0-19-year age group [23]. However, a preprint paper [11] reports that children under 10 who were potentially exposed to the virus were just as likely to become infected as other age groups in the population. Low observed rates of infection and similar susceptibility to infection could be explained by differences in symptomatic infection rates. Other factors may have included social-distancing methods, such as school closures. It should also be noted that the age profile of the population in China is unusual, in that few children will have siblings but will usually have 2 parents and up to 4 grandparents. Critically, serological data are missing at this stage in the pandemic, without which uncertainty about infection rates is likely to persist.In this study we have reviewed the early data on the likelihood of infection, clinical presentation and outcomes, and transmission of COVID-19 in children.

        <p>Reliable evidence about clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 in children is limited to small case series and case reports. Key emerging themes from the literature include description of generally mild symptoms [12] and several reports of asymptomatic infections [9,[14][15][16][17], with some indication from a case series of 105 children in Wuhan that there have been severe cases (7.6%) [18]. Rarely, pediatric deaths have also been reported [19]. We found no detailed studies of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children. Many of the childhood cases are from familial clusters with children identified through contact tracing of adult cases [20,21]. There is only 1 case describing likely transmission from a 3-month-old infant to her parents after they looked after the unwell infant without personal protective measures [12]. Of note is the high frequency of chest radiographic abnormality described in both mild and asymptomatic infections in children. Longitudinal data will be required to understand the duration, persistence, and functional deficit related to these findings.Reliable evidence about clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 in children is limited to small case series and case reports.

        <p>We detected only a weak signal that children with comorbidities are at increased risk or are overrepresented among pediatric COVID-19 cases. This is broadly in line with a review of 14 pediatric MERS cases, of whom 9 without underlying disease remained healthy and 3 developed mild respiratory symptoms; the remaining 2 cases had significant comorbidities, developed severe respiratory symptoms, were treated in intensive care, and subsequently died. Given that poor COVID-19 outcomes have been seen in adults with underlying conditions, a similar issue in children might be anticipated when sufficient data are available. Typically, a pediatric population may contain approximately 10% of children with 1 or more of the following: prematurity with chronic lung disease, cancer, genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis and ɑ1-antitrypsin deficiency, chronic asthma, and mucosal immune defects [24]. More evidence is therefore needed about clinical features and outcomes in children with high-risk conditions.We detected only a weak signal that children with comorbidities are at increased risk or are overrepresented among pediatric COVID-19 cases.

Typically, a pediatric population may contain approximately 10% of children with 1 or more of the following: prematurity with chronic lung disease, cancer, genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis and ɑ1-antitrypsin deficiency, chronic asthma, and mucosal immune defects [24]. More evidence is therefore needed about clinical features and outcomes in children with high-risk conditions.</p>
        <p>So far there has been only 1 documented case of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a child to an adult, although if infection rates are as high in children as in adults, as described by Bi et al [11], it would be highly implausible that children were not infecting adults in a more widespread way. The WHO-China Joint Mission was unable to shed any light on this beyond anecdotally reporting no transmission from children [7]. One study attempts to assess the impact of Hong Kong's public health measures and population behavior change on COVID-19 transmission, using routine influenza surveillance data as a proxy, assuming that influenza and COVID-19 are likely transmitted in similar ways [25]. The authors demonstrate the substantial impact that familiar public health measures (including school closure), social distancing, and behavioral change could have in slowing down COVID-19 transmission, although questions remain about whether these measures can avoid fatigue and be sustained in the long term.So far there has been only 1 documented case of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from a child to an adult, although if infection rates are as high in children as in adults, as described by Bi et al [11], it would be highly implausible that children were not infecting adults in a more widespread way.

        <p>While the evidence we reviewed related mainly to data from China, as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide data are beginning to emerge from other countries, including Italy [26], South Korea [27], Iceland [28], and the United States [29]. These reports corroborate our findings of lower observed rates of infection in children [25][26][27][28], a milder disease course [29], and asymptomatic cases having a role in transmission [28,29]. Varying public health measures and testing policies between countries should be noted in such comparisons.While the evidence we reviewed related mainly to data from China, as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide data are beginning to emerge from other countries, including Italy [26], South Korea [27], Iceland [28], and the United States [29].

        <p>It is informative to compare our findings with the literature for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, while data on SARS-CoV-2 are emerging. The majority of documented cases of SARS-CoV occurred in adults, in whom SARS was a severe respiratory disease characterized by fever and dyspnea, which could progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [30]. Pediatric infection rates in SARS-CoV were low (135 cases in patients aged &lt;18 years; 0.01%) with no deaths reported. The evidence is clear that young children (&lt;12 years of age) generally had a milder course that had resolved by day 7, and that symptoms in teenagers were more akin to those in adults [31][32][33][34][35][36][37]. Follow-up studies in 47 children with SARS-CoV who were asymptomatic detected abnormal imaging high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in 16 of 47 and abnormal lung function in 4 of 47 [11], and another study that followed up 34 affected children revealed reduced aerobic capacity at both 6 and 15 months postdiagnosis [38]. It will be important to be alert for similar long-term consequences for children infected by SARS-CoV-2.It is informative to compare our findings with the literature for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, while data on SARS-CoV-2 are emerging.

        <p>There is little high-quality evidence relating to transmission of SARS-CoV in children. Public awareness of infection was high in the community, and parents were instructed to keep their child out of school if they had fever or respiratory symptoms, and so there was no documented spread in schools [34]. One seroprevalence study for SARS-CoV in children compared those residing in a district with a point source outbreak compared with a low-risk area [39]. Seroprevalence in both areas was low (0.6% in the high-risk area, 0% in the low-risk area, with positive children having reported no SARS-compatible symptoms). This would suggest that positive serology for SARS-CoV in healthy asymptomatic children was very uncommon (0.57%), suggesting a low rate of asymptomatic infection (in possible contrast to SARS-CoV-2), and that community transmissibility of this virus was low.There is little high-quality evidence relating to transmission of SARS-CoV in children.

        <p>There are even fewer data relating to MERS-CoV in children. The majority of documented cases of MERS-CoV were in adults. There were 31 reported cases of MERS in children out of a global total of 2449 cases to June 2019 (0.01%). Notably, 13 of 31 (42%) were asymptomatic, identified through contact tracing. Of the 31 children, 2 who had underlying comorbidities died [40]. There is no evidence of transmission of MERS-CoV from children to adults.There are even fewer data relating to MERS-CoV in children.

        <p>From large datasets in China, COVID-19 has been observed in children and young people at a low rate relative to the adult population. Limited data on attack rate suggest that children under 10 are infected with SARS-CoV-2 at approximately the same rates as adults. Children may be asymptomatic or too mildly infected to draw medical attention and be tested and counted in observed cases of COVID-19. Societal measures to limit the spread of the outbreak and household configuration in China (as a legacy of the "1-child" policy) may limit generalizability to other countries or settings.From large datasets in China, COVID-19 has been observed in children and young people at a low rate relative to the adult population.

        <p>Evidence suggests that the clinical course in young children is milder than in adults, although there is a paucity of data and less is known about the course in adolescents. There are several reports of asymptomatic infection in children, which would appear to be consistent with emerging data relating to infection rates. There are, as yet, inadequate data on transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 from children to other children. More evidence is required on all aspects of COVID-19 in pediatric populations including seroprevalence studies when an assay is available and long-term follow-up of silent radiographic abnormalities.Evidence suggests that the clinical course in young children is milder than in adults, although there is a paucity of data and less is known about the course in adolescents.
