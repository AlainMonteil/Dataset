        <p>Although plenty of data exist regarding clinical manifestations, course, case fatality rate, and risk factors associated with mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), longterm respiratory and functional sequelae in survivors of COVID-19 are unknown. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the prevalence of lung function anomalies, exercise function impairment, and psychological sequelae among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 4 months after discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective cohort study at an academic hospital in Northern Italy was conducted among a consecutive series of patients aged 18 years and older (or their caregivers) who had received a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severe enough to require hospital admission from March 1 to June 29, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, bronchial swab, serological testing, or suggestive computed tomography results. EXPOSURE Severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of the study was to describe the proportion of patients with a diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (D LCO ) less than 80% of expected value. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with severe lung function impairment (defined as D LCO &lt;60% expected value); proportion of patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms (measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised total score); proportion of patients with functional impairment (assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score and 2-minute walking test); and identification of factors associated with D LCO reduction and psychological or functional sequelae. RESULTS Among 767 patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, 494 (64.4%) refused to participate, and 35 (4.6%) died during follow-up. A total of 238 patients (31.0%) (median [interquartile range] age, 61 [50-71] years; 142 [59.7%] men; median [interquartile range] comorbidities, 2 [1-3]) consented to participate to the study. Of these, 219 patients were able to complete both pulmonary function tests and D LCO measurement. D LCO was reduced to less than 80% of the estimated value in 113 patients (51.6%) and less than 60% in 34 patients (15.5%). The SPPB score was suggested limited mobility (score &lt;11) in 53 patients (22.3%). Patients with SPPB scores within reference range underwent a 2-minute walk test, which was outside reference ranges of expected performance for (continued) Key Points Question What respiratory, functional, and psychological sequalae are associated with recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? Findings In this cohort study of 238 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in an academic hospital in Northern Italy, more than half of participants had a significant reduction of diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide or measurable functional impairment and approximately one-fifth of patients had symptoms of posttraumatic stress 4 months after discharge. Meaning These findings suggest that despite virological recovery, a sizable proportion of patients with COVID-19 experienced respiratory, functional, or psychological sequelae months after hospital discharge.Although plenty of data exist regarding clinical manifestations, course, case fatality rate, and risk factors associated with mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), longterm respiratory and functional sequelae in survivors of COVID-19 are unknown.

        <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be completely asymptomatic or, conversely, can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which the clinical outcomes range from mild upper airways symptoms to a severe disease with respiratory failure and a high fatality rate. 1 As of November 2020, more than 60 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and more than 1.4 million people have died. 2 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers focused attention on clinical features and prognosis of the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3,4 As a consequence, we are now far more able to estimate prognoses and optimize clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19 compared with the beginning of the pandemic. 5 In contrast, the type and severity of respiratory or functional sequelae COVID-19 are unknown.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be completely asymptomatic or, conversely, can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which the clinical outcomes range from mild upper airways symptoms to a severe disease with respiratory failure and a high fatality rate. 1 As of November 2020, more than 60 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and more than 1.4 million people have died. 2 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers focused attention on clinical features and prognosis of the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3,4 As a consequence, we are now far more able to estimate prognoses and optimize clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19 compared with the beginning of the pandemic. 5 In contrast, the type and severity of respiratory or functional sequelae COVID-19 are unknown.</p>
        <p>While COVID-19 is a systemic disease, 6 the lungs are most commonly affected, with histopathological findings that may include diffuse alveolar epithelium destruction, capillary damage or bleeding, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar septal fibrous proliferation, and pulmonary consolidation. 7 As a consequence, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D LCO ) is commonly altered in patients who recover from COVID-19, 8 similarly to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), illnesses that are associated with an impairment of lung function lasting months to years. 9,10 Impairment in exercise capacity often parallels D LCO reduction: patients who recover from SARS pneumonia have been found to have 6-minute walking test and 36-item Short Form General Health Survey scores persistently lower than the general population. 9 Moreover, the functional impairment associated with COVID-19 may also be associated with adverse psychological outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach investigating the functional and psychological aspects associated with COVID-19 may be more effective in disclosing potential sequelae associated with COVID-19. In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate prevalence and clinical associations of functional and psychological impairment 4 months after recovery from COVID-19.While COVID-19 is a systemic disease, 6 the lungs are most commonly affected, with histopathological findings that may include diffuse alveolar epithelium destruction, capillary damage or bleeding, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar septal fibrous proliferation, and pulmonary consolidation. 7 As a consequence, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D LCO ) is commonly altered in patients who recover from COVID-19, 8 similarly to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), illnesses that are associated with an impairment of lung function lasting months to years. 9,10 Impairment in exercise capacity often parallels D LCO reduction: patients who recover from SARS pneumonia have been found to have 6-minute walking test and 36-item Short Form General Health Survey scores persistently lower than the general population. 9 Moreover, the functional impairment associated with COVID-19 may also be associated with adverse psychological outcomes.

        <p>Patients were contacted by telephone, and telephone follow-up was performed 3 to 4 months after discharge. A total of 35 patients (4.6%) died after discharge. Of the remaining patients, 494 (64.4%) 12,13 Briefly, the following safety measures were adopted: in a dedicated room, a dedicated spirometer was used to avoid cross-infection of patients not included in this program. The technician (and the pulmonologist, if needed) used full PPE (ie, face mask, N95 respirator, gown, and gloves). To avoid cross-infections between patients included in the program, a mouthpiece with an antimicrobial filter was used and changed for every patient.

        <p>We assessed the patients' physical performance with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which includes balance assessment in standing position, walking speed for 4 m, and standing up from a chair with 5 repetitions. This test allows hierarchizing patients according to their functional status with a good predictivity on the disability level in daily activities. A score greater than 10 is the expected value for healthy individuals. 14,15 However, it should be noted that SPPB may not distinguish performance level in highfunctioning patients. 16 To improve the sensitivity of functional impairment detection, patients with SPPB scores greater than 10 were tested with the 2-minute walk test to evaluate the residual aerobic capacity; the 2-minute walk test score was compared with reference data for an age-and sex-matched population.

        <p>We assessed the presence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms by administering the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), 20 a 15-item self-rated 4-point scale based on how often an event has occurred in the past 7 days (0 indicates not at all; 1, rarely; 3, sometimes; 5, often). All IES-R items are anchored to a specific stressor. Besides the IES total subjective stress score, 2 subscales were identified. One subscale measured intrusive symptoms, including intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and intrusive feelings and imagery, using 7 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 35; the other subscale measured avoidance symptoms, such as numbing of responsiveness and avoidance of feelings, situations, or ideas, using 8 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 40.We assessed the presence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms by administering the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), 20 a 15-item self-rated 4-point scale based on how often an event has occurred in the past 7 days (0 indicates not at all; 1, rarely; 3, sometimes; 5, often).

            <rs type="version">15.1</rs> (
            <rs type="creator">StataCorp</rs>). Normality was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test. The measures of centrality and dispersion chosen for continuous variables were medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs); comparisons between groups for these variables were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables, whenever dichotomous or nominal, were reported as frequencies and percentages and analyzed through the Pearson χ 2 , Cochran-Armitage test, or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a D LCO less than 80% of expected. The study was sufficiently powered to detect as statistically significant a 0.12 increase in the proportion of patients with D LCO less than 80% of expected among survivors of COVID-19 compared with that observed in a reference population 21 (Table 3) found that the perception of reduced tolerance to physical exercise was associated with younger age and ICU admission during hospitalization.

        <p>Finally, we tested patients for PTS symptoms. Results of the IES-R questionnaire were within reference ranges in 136 patients (57.1%), while in 61 patients (25.6%) had mild symptoms, 27 patients (11.3%) had moderate symptoms, and 14 patients (5.9%) had severe symptoms. Male sex was the only factor independently associated with the presence of moderate to severe PTS symptoms (eTable 5 in the Supplement; Table 4).Finally, we tested patients for PTS symptoms.

        <p>Little is known about the lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors of COVID-19. In this cohort study, we found that a significant proportion of survivors of COVID-19 experienced respiratory or functional impairment 4 months after hospital discharge, relevant psychological consequences. Indeed, at the end of follow-up, more than half of the study population still had D LCO less than 80% of expected. When a more stringent threshold of less than 60% of expected was applied, the proportion of patients with severe impairment decreased to 15%. Thus, a significantly impaired diffusion persisted in a sizable proportion of survivors of COVID-19. The lack of a pre-COVID-19 measurement prevents exact quantification of the association of COVID-19 with PFT deterioration. However, the isolated reduction of D LCO with a preservation of other PFT parameters is consistent with damage associated with COVID-19, given that D LCO reduction is the most common functional alteration reported in patients with COVID-19. 8 In line with our results, a study by Huang et al 22 reported that more than 50% of patients had D LCO less than 80% of expected 30 days after hospital discharge. However, a study by Zhao et al 23 reported only 9 of 55 patients (16.4%) had a D LCO less than 80% of expected 3 months after hospital discharge. The populations these studies described were significantly different from ours, being younger (median age, 48 years) and with a very low prevalence of smokers; accordingly, these studies included no patients with underlying pulmonary disease.Little is known about the lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors of COVID-19.

        <p>As for factors associated with reduced D LCO , female sex was a significant factor, possibly reflecting fitness level. 24 Interestingly, a history of CKD and the modality of oxygen administration during hospitalization were associated with reductions in D LCO , probably owing to a more severe acute illness. 25,26 Conversely, COPD and ICU admission emerged as factors associated with severe lung function impairment. A reduction of D LCO is associated with pulmonary fibrosis in different clinical settings, such as interstitial lung diseases and systemic sclerosis 27,28 ; whether survivors of COVID-19 with impaired D LCO are at increased risk of progressive lung fibrosis will require a longer follow-up. Indeed, fibrotic evolution has been described after SARS pneumonia. 29 Some degree of motor impairment was observed in 53.8% of our study population. Different factors might be invoked to explain this observation, including lung damage, circulatory limitation, muscle weakness, critical illness neuropathy, and myopathy. Our data suggest an association of pulmonary function impairment; indeed, D LCO and a history of COPD were independently associated with impaired physical function.As for factors associated with reduced D LCO , female sex was a significant factor, possibly reflecting fitness level. 24 Interestingly, a history of CKD and the modality of oxygen administration during hospitalization were associated with reductions in D LCO , probably owing to a more severe acute illness. 25,26 Conversely, COPD and ICU admission emerged as factors associated with severe lung function impairment.

        <p>Interestingly, many people perceived that COVID-19 had a detrimental impact on their physical performances, and ICU admission being associated with this perception may be associated with deconditioning. Remarkably, age was not associated with reduced D LCO or impaired motor function.Interestingly, many people perceived that COVID-19 had a detrimental impact on their physical performances, and ICU admission being associated with this perception may be associated with deconditioning.

        <p>In COVID-19, the case fatality rate increases with age 30 ; therefore, it would be reasonable to expect a higher burden of residual impairment in older patients.

Our data are in contrast with this hypothesis.</p>
        <p>We speculate that older people may have a higher baseline comorbidity burden, which was detrimentally associated with their survival probability during acute illness, but in survivors, the residual damage was not worse than in younger people. Essentially, this finding confirms that older individuals who survive COVID-19 may not be less able than their younger counterparts to revert to How long this loss will persist is unknown. Interestingly, one-third of patients reporting arthralgia and myalgia during the acute phase still experienced these symptoms at 4 months. Our findings are in line with 2 cohort studies. 33,37 However, the proportion of patients who were symptomatic in our study was lower than those reported in the studies by Carfi et al 33 and Carvalho-Schneidfer et al, 37 suggesting a progressive improvement over time. Overall, these findings suggest that many patients experience a slow recovery after the acute phase of COVID-19.We speculate that older people may have a higher baseline comorbidity burden, which was detrimentally associated with their survival probability during acute illness, but in survivors, the residual damage was not worse than in younger people.

        <p>This study has several limitations. A key limitation of our study is patient selection: we contacted only patients who had a severe enough COVID-19 to be admitted to a hospital. Moreover, many discharged patients declined study participation for reasons that may have included perceived full recovery in some or the inability or unwillingness to attend extra visits. This might have generated a selection bias, considering that the real proportion of patients still experiencing functional or psychological sequelae might have been lower if all had participated. Our psychological evaluation was limited to PTS symptoms, which does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions about the full psychological impact of COVID-19, which may include many other aspects, such as sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, we reported an unexpectedly high residual mortality in the first few months after hospital discharge. This is a novel, worrisome finding that warrants further examination.This study has several limitations.

JAMA Network Open. 2021;4(1):e2036142. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.36142 (Reprinted) January 27, 2021 5/12 Downloaded From: https://jamanetwork.com/ Universita del Piemonte Orientale by Pier Paolo Sainaghi on 06/09/2023 Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most commonly reported symptoms during the acute phase but largely remitted in the following months. However, 13 patients (5.5%) still reported dyspnea at 4 months after discharge (Table 1). At 4 months, 12 patients (5.0%) still experienced ageusia and 11 patients (4.6%) still experienced anosmia. Additionally, 14 patients (5.9%) reported still experiencing arthralgia at follow-up, and 14 patients (5.9%) reported still experiencing myalgia. PFTs A total of 14 patients were not able to complete PFTs. Among the remaining 224 patients, the median (IQR) FEV 1 was 101% (91.5%-112%) of expected and the median (IQR) FVC was 98.5% (90%-109%) of expected. Five more patients were not able to complete the assessment of the D LCO , which was therefore measured in 219 patients. The median (IQR) D LCO was 79% (69%-89%) of expected. D LCO was less than 80% of expected in 113 patients (51.6%); more severe impairment (ie, D LCO &lt;60% of expected) was observed in 34 patients (15.5%). The results of the univariate analysis of factors associated with impaired D LCO are reported in eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement. In logistic regression analysis, risk factors associated with D LCO less than 80% of expected at follow-up included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.33 [95% CI, 2.25-8.33]; P &lt; .001), CKD (OR, 10.12 [95% CI, 2.00-51.05]; P = .005), and the modality of oxygen delivery during hospital stay (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.08-2.61]; P = .02). Risk factors associated with D LCO less than 60% at follow-up were female sex (OR, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.11-6.55]; P = .03), COPD (OR, 5.52 [95% CI, 1.32-23.08]; P = .02), and ICU admission during hospital stay (OR, 5.76 [95% CI, 1.37-24.25]; P = .02) (Table 2). LCO was associated with decreased risk of physical impairment (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]; P &lt; .001). When directly questioned, 50 patients (21.0%) reported that their tolerance to exercise had worsened after COVID-19. Univariate analysis (eTable 4 in the Supplement) and logistic regressionwere men.
