        <p>Purpose: Gallium-68 (Ga-68)-labeled tracers for imaging expression of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) such as the [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC have already demonstrated high potential for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer. However, compared to Ga-68, a labeling with fluorine-18 (F-18) would offer advantages with respect to availability, production amount, and image resolution. [ 18 F]DCFPyL is a promising F-18-labeled candidate for PSMApositron emission tomography (PET) imaging that has been recently introduced. In the current study, we aimed to compare [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and [ 18 F]DCFPyL for clinical use in biochemically relapsed prostate cancer. Procedures: In 14 selected patients with PSA relapse of prostate cancer, [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) was performed in addition to [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT. A systematic comparison was carried out between results obtained with both tracers with regard to the number of detected PSMA-positive lesions, the standardized uptake value (SUV) max and the lesion to background ratios. Results: All suspicious lesions identified by [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC were also detected with [ 18 F]DCFPyL. In three patients, additional lesions were observed using [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/CT. The mean SUV max in the concordant [ 18 F]DCFPyL PSMA-positive lesions was significantly higher as compared to [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (14.5 vs. 12.2, p=0.028, n=15). The mean tumor to background ratios (n= 15) were significantly higher for [ 18 F]DCFPyL compared to [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC using kidney, spleen, or parotid as reference organs (p=0.006, p=0.002, p=0.008), but no significant differences were found using the liver (p=0.167) or the mediastinum (p=0.363) as reference organs. Conclusion: [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/CT provided a high image quality and visualized small prostate lesions with excellent sensitivity. [ 18 F]DCFPyL represents a highly promising alternative to [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC for PSMA-PET/CT imaging in relapsed prostate cancer.Purpose: Gallium-68 (Ga-68)-labeled tracers for imaging expression of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) such as the [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC have already demonstrated high potential for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer.

        <p>T he prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed on the cell surface of prostate cancer (PC) cells [1]. Recent studies with gallium-68 (Ga-68)labeled Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx) ([ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) have shown the potential of this radioligand to detect relapses and metastases of PC with improved contrast when compared to [ 18 F]fluoromethylcholine positron emission tomography (PET)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) [2][3][4][5]. Additionally, iodine-124, iodine-131, and lutetium-177-labeled PSMA ligands have been reported for dosimetric and therapeutic use [6,7]. Several PSMA inhibitors were developed which compromise different pharmacophoric structures to interact with the binding pocket for N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate. PSMA-binding ligands are bound to the extracellular domain of PSMA. However, the transmembranous location of the binding domain and its enzyme activity enable the subsequent internalization of these ligands. The prostate-specific membrane antigen is also expressed in the tumor-associated neovasculature of gastric and colorectal cancer [8,9]. Thus, these PSMAselective ligands may be of interest for imaging other tumor types in the future.T he prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed on the cell surface of prostate cancer (PC) cells [1].

        <p>In comparison to currently broadly applied Ga-68labeled PSMA ligands, fluorine-18 (F-18)-labeled compounds would offer some important advantages. This includes not only an increase of the number of examinations owing to the higher production capacity but also an excellent image quality. The latter will be a result of optimized tracer doses leading to high imaging statistics and the decay properties of F-18 itself. F-18 exhibits a low positron emission energy of 0.6 MeV. Therefore, the distance to decelerate the positron in human tissue is much shorter in comparison to Ga-68 (β + -energy=2.3 MeV) resulting in a much higher image resolution. Recently, Chen and colleagues [10] have published first data on [ 18 F]DCFPyL (2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-[ 18 F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)-pentanedioic acid), a new PSMA-selective ligand with a high binding affinity for PSMA. It was suggested that this compound may represent a highly promising candidate for PET imaging of PSMA-overexpressing tissues [10].In comparison to currently broadly applied Ga-68labeled PSMA ligands, fluorine-18 (F-18)-labeled compounds would offer some important advantages.

        <p>In this study, 14 selected patients were included who underwent both [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT and [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/ CT with the aim to determine if one of the two tracers exhibits better detection of recurrent prostate cancer and/or metastases. The patients had biochemical relapse of prostate cancer after initial curative treatment, either radical prostatectomy or radiation-based therapy. All patients showed rising PSA level and suspected progressive disease following prior treatment of prostate cancer. In 11 patients, the PSA level had increased to more than 1 ng/ml. All patients underwent the examination as part of their clinical workup. Patients were selected for the dual-scan procedure assuming that a thorough diagnostic assessment would have a significant influence on their individual subsequent therapeutic measures, i.e., local versus systemic therapy, indication for or exclusion from surgical treatment or external beam radiation therapy. This included, e.g., suspected false-negative or equivocal PET/CT results, detection of a solitary metastasis, or oligometastatic status potentially accessible for local therapy.In this study, 14 selected patients were included who underwent both [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT and [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/ CT with the aim to determine if one of the two tracers exhibits better detection of recurrent prostate cancer and/or metastases.

Indeed, both the RT-labeled fraction and the 95 °C-labeled fraction bound PSMA with identical affinities (IC 50 values 27.4±1.3 and 24.8±1.2 nm, respectively) [13]. The synthesis of [ 18 F]DCFPyL was performed under GMP conditions as previously reported by Chen et al. [10].

In 3 patients, at least one additional PSMA-positive lesion was detected with [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/CT as compared to the [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA scan. Thus, all patients were classified accordingly with both tracers regarding the general presence of a PSMA-positive suspicious finding (yes/no). Eleven patients (79 %) would also have been classified consistently with both tracers regarding number and location of their lesions, and in 3 (21 %) of patients, additional lesions were detected with [ 18 F]DCFPyL.

The mean background SUV mean values for [ 18 F]DCFPyL and [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in all 14 patients examined were 6.2 and 5.1 in the liver (p=0.049), 4.9 and 7.2 in the spleen (p=0.005), 19.6 and 31.7 in the kidney (p=0.001), 1.3 and 1.2 in the mediastinum (p=0.056, n.s.), and 10.9 and 12.9 in the parotid (n=0.121, n.s.), respectively.The mean SUV max in the concordant PSMA-positive lesions was 14.5 for [ 18 F]DCFPyL and 12.2 for [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (p=0.028, n=15 metastases).

        <p>To compare the tumor/background contrast between the two tracers, we calculated SUV values in suspicious lesions/ background in seven patients with maximum three lesions, detectable with both PET procedures. This resulted in a comparison of altogether 15 tumor/background ratios. Most of the suspected lymph node/bone metastases showed a higher SUV ratio for [ 18 F]DCFPyL using the kidney (Fig. 5a) or the spleen as a reference region, but no significant difference was found when using for the liver (Fig. 5b) or the mediastinum as reference organ. In detail, the mean tumor to background ratios between the SUV max in the PSMA-avid lesions with [ 18 F]DCFPyL and [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC were 2.9 and 2.3 as compared with the SUV mean in the liver (p=0.167, n.s.), 4.3 and 2.1 as compared with the SUV mean in the spleen (p=0.002), 1.0 and 0.4 as compared with the SUV mean in the kidney (p= 0.006), 10.7 and 9.7 as compared with the SUV mean in the mediastinum (p=0.363, n.s.), and 1.4 and 0.9 as compared with the SUV mean in the parotid (p=0.008), respectively.To compare the tumor/background contrast between the two tracers, we calculated SUV values in suspicious lesions/ background in seven patients with maximum three lesions, detectable with both PET procedures.

        <p>In the majority of cases, [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/CT resulted in accumulating evidence, supporting further treatment decisions consistently. Both imaging series accordingly supported decisions towards core biopsy of the irradiated prostate in three patients, to local therapy options (lymph node dissection or radiotherapy) in four patients with one to two PSMA-positive lymph nodes and to systematic therapy in three patients. In four patients, neither imaging test detected a lesion explaining the rise in PSA levels. [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/CT resulted in the detection of additional vertebral bone metastases in two patients (patient 2 and 12) in an oligometastatic state (patient 2 showed bone metastases also in [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT but to a lesser extent). This finding did not have immediate therapeutical consequences because both patients were asymptomatic at the time of their PET/CT examination. However, more accurate knowledge on the extent of bone metastases bears the potential to perform better targeted radiotherapy in the future (i.e., if the patients become symptomatic from their bone metastases). The detection of many PSMA-positive supradiaphragmatic lymph nodes with [ 18 F]DCFPyL in addition to retroperitoneal lymph node metastases also detected with [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC supported the decision to omit local radiotherapy of the retroperitoneal lymphatic pathways (patient 12). In one patient, a second PSMA-avid lymph node in the upper pelvis was detected with [ 18 F]DCFPyL in addition to another pelvic lymph node (detected with both tracers). In this patient, systematic bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection was performed and not influenced by the [ 18 F]DCFPyL findings. Unfortunately, only the larger metastasis (positive with both tracers) was detected intraoperatively and the patient remained PSA positive after surgery (patient 7).In the majority of cases, [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC and [ 18 F]DCFPyL PET/CT resulted in accumulating evidence, supporting further treatment decisions consistently.

        <p>Y Using [ 18 F]DCFPyL, additional suspicious lesions plausible for further metastases were detected in 3/14 patients. This indicates a high sensitivity of this tracer. One explanation for the higher detection rate using [ 18 F]DCFPyL can be found in the higher injected dose, which allowed later acquisition times, potentially leading to better signal to noise ratios due to reduction of nonspecific signal. Lower background activity has been observed for the [ 18 F]DCFPyL in some organs such as the kidney. Independently from injected dose, faster clearance of the tracer from non-target tissue and higher affinity, may potentially have contributed to the detection of additional skeletal metastases observed for [ 18 F]DCFPyL as compared to [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC.Y Using [ 18 F]DCFPyL, additional suspicious lesions plausible for further metastases were detected in 3/14 patients.

        <p>It is important to notice that the higher detection rate for PSMA-avid lymph nodes by [ 18 F]DCFPyL was not attributed to retroperitoneal PSMA foci, where the differentiation against celiac ganglia (i.e., false-positive findings) might be a question [15].It is important to notice that the higher detection rate for PSMA-avid lymph nodes by [ 18 F]DCFPyL was not attributed to retroperitoneal PSMA foci, where the differentiation against celiac ganglia (i.e., false-positive findings) might be a question [15].</p>
        <p>Radiolabeling with Ga-68 is an excellent alternative for imaging centers with expertise in handling the commercially available 68 Ge/ 68 Ga radionuclide generator but without own (cost-intense) cyclotron. However, a single preparation (0.3-0.6 GBq Ga-68) may only allow scanning up to two to four patients and the output depends on the half-life of the generator. As now established at our center, a single radiolabeling procedure of [ 18 F]DCFPyL resulted in a batch containing 6 to 7 GBq of [ 18 F]DCFPyL. This rendered it possible to examine six patients after a single preparation with an optimal dose, which represents an advantage for centers with an own cyclotron and a production of F-18 in the daily management. Furthermore, due to the longer halflife of F-18 (110 vs. 68 min for Ga-68), it may also allow transportation to remote sites from commercial vendors.Radiolabeling with Ga-68 is an excellent alternative for imaging centers with expertise in handling the commercially available 68 Ge/ 68 Ga radionuclide generator but without own (cost-intense) cyclotron.

        <p>A limitation of the current study is the lack of a consistent histological validation of [ 18 F]DCFPyL findings. In principle, it cannot be excluded that additional lesions detected with [ 18 F]DCFPyL may represent false-positive findings. However, particularly small PSMA-positive findings cannot be easily confirmed histologically and it is impossible to assess all lesions in patients with multiple metastases. Generally, good correspondence between [ 18 F]DCFPyL and [ 68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC findings was observed, several lesions were confirmed histopathologically, and the additional bone lesions detected with [ 18 F]DCFPyL were verified retrospectively by CT findings suspicious for bone metastases. Thus, we believe that the high sensitivity of [ 18 F]DCFPyL, as indicated in the current study, appears plausible. Nevertheless, the findings of the current study are to be considered preliminary and the clinical performance of [ 18 F]DCFPyL will have to be further analyzed in the future.A limitation of the current study is the lack of a consistent histological validation of [ 18 F]DCFPyL findings.

        <p>Independently from the radiolabeling with [ 18 F] or [ 68 Ga], previous cancer therapies and low PSMA expression caused by tumor heterogeneity [16,17] might be responsible for false-negative PET/CT results in some patients.
