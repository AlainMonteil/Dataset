        <p>The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species. Here, we utilized a unique dataset of 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals, to study cross-species conservation of ACE2 and its likelihood to function as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We designed a five-category ranking score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between receptor and virus, classifying all species from very high to very low . Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories, and only catarrhine primates in the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 binding, and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (&lt;0.1%) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we observed evidence of positive selection in ACE2 in multiple species, including bats. Utilized appropriately, our results may lead to the identification of intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2, justify the selection of animal models of COVID-19, and assist the conservation of animals both in native habitats and in human care.The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19).

        <p>The 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 virus) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), a major pandemic that threatens millions of lives and the global economy (1) . Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus sequences has shown that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, followed by transmission to an intermediate host, and that both viruses may have an extended host range that includes primates and other mammals (1)(2)(3) . However, the immediate source population/species for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses has not yet been identified. Several mammalian species host coronaviruses, and these infections are frequently associated with severe clinical diseases, such as respiratory and enteric disease in pigs and cattle (4,5) .The 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 virus) is the cause of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), a major pandemic that threatens millions of lives and the global economy (1) .

        <p>Molecular phylogenetics revealed that at least one human coronavirus (HCov-OC43), may have originated in cattle or swine (6) , and that this virus was associated with a human pandemic that emerged in the late 19 th century (7) . Recent data indicate that coronaviruses can move from bats to other wildlife species and humans (8) and from humans to tigers (9) and pigs (10) . Therefore, understanding the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses is essential for improving our ability to predict and control future pandemics. It is also crucial for protecting populations of wildlife species in native habitats and under human care, particularly non-human primates, who may also be susceptible to COVID-19 (11) .Molecular phylogenetics revealed that at least one human coronavirus (HCov-OC43), may have originated in cattle or swine (6) , and that this virus was associated with a human pandemic that emerged in the late 19 th century (7) .

        <p>The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a functional receptor for the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (12,13) . Under normal physiological conditions, ACE2 is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin 1-9, a peptide of unknown function, and angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictor that is important in the regulation of blood pressure (14) . ACE2 also converts angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, a vasodilator that affects the cardiovascular system (14) and may regulate other components of the renin-angiotensin system (15) .The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a functional receptor for the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (12,13) .

        <p>The host range of SARS-CoV-2 may be extremely broad due to the conservation of ACE2 in mammals (2,13) and its expression on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes (10) . While coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a primary receptor, coronaviruses may use other proteases as receptors, such as CD26 (DPP4) for MERS-CoV (16) , thus limiting or extending their host range.The host range of SARS-CoV-2 may be extremely broad due to the conservation of ACE2 in mammals (2,13) and its expression on ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes (10) .

        <p>Sequence variation in ACE2 affects the protein's functions. ACE2 is polymorphic in humans, with many synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations identified, although most are rare at the population level (17) and few are believed to affect cellular susceptibility to human coronavirus infections (18) . Site-directed mutagenesis and co-precipitation of SARS-CoV constructs have revealed critical residues on the ACE2 tertiary structure that are essential for binding to the virus receptor binding domain (RBD) (19) . These findings have been strongly supported by co-crystallization and the structural determination of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins with human ACE2 (13,20,21) , as well as binding-affinity with heterologous ACE2 (19) . The RBD of human coronaviruses may mutate to change the binding affinity of S for ACE2, and thus lead to adaptation in humans or other hosts. The best studied example is the palm civet, believed to have been the intermediate host between bats and humans for SARS-CoV (2) .Sequence variation in ACE2 affects the protein's functions.

        <p>Here, we made use of sequenced genomes of 410 vertebrates and protein structural analysis, to identify ACE2 homologs in all vertebrate classes (fishes, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals) that have the potential to serve as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the evolution of ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S binding sites. Our results reinforce earlier findings on the natural host range of SARS-CoV-2, and predict a broader group of species that may serve as a reservoir or intermediate host for this virus. Importantly, many threatened and endangered species were found to be at potential risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that as the pandemic spreads, humans could inadvertently introduce a potentially devastating new threat to these already vulnerable populations, especially for great apes and other primates.Here, we made use of sequenced genomes of 410 vertebrates and protein structural analysis, to identify ACE2 homologs in all vertebrate classes (fishes, amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals) that have the potential to serve as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and to understand the evolution of ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S binding sites.

        <p>Comparison of vertebrate ACE2 sequences and their predicted ability to bind SARS-CoV-2 . We identified 410 unique vertebrate species with ACE2 orthologs (Dataset S1) that included representatives of all vertebrate taxonomic classes. Among these were 252 mammals, 72 birds, 65 fishes, 17 reptiles and 4 amphibians. Twenty-five amino acids corresponding to known SARS-CoV-2 S-binding residues (11,13,21) were examined for their similarity to the residues in human ACE2 (Fig. 1, Dataset S1). On the basis of known interactions between specific residues on ACE2 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S, a set of rules was developed for predicting the likelihood of S binding to ACE2 from each species (see Materials and Methods). Five score categories were predicted: very high , high , medium , low and very low . Results for all species and all SARS-CoV-2 S binding scores are shown in Dataset S1, and results for mammalian species are also shown in Fig. 1. The very high classification had at least 23/25 ACE2 residues identical to their human homolog and other constraints on substitutions at SARS-CoV-2 S binding hot spots (see Materials and Methods). The 18 species predicted as very high were all Old World primates and apes completely identical to human across the 25 ACE2 binding residues. The ACE2 proteins of 28 species were classified as having a high likelihood of binding the S RBD. Among them are twelve cetaceans, seven rodents, three cervids (deer), three lemuriform primates, two representatives of the order Pilosa (Giant anteater and Southern tamandua), and one Old World primate (Angola colobus, Fig. 1).Comparison of vertebrate ACE2 sequences and their predicted ability to bind SARS-CoV-2 .

        <p>Fifty-seven species scored as medium for the ability of their ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV-2 S. Like the high score, this category has at least 20/25 residues identical to human ACE2 but more relaxed constraints for critical binding residues. All species with medium score are mammals distributed across six orders. Among Carnivora, 9/43 scored medium , 9/43 scored low , and 25/43 scored very low (Fig. 1). The carnivores scoring medium were only felids, including the domestic cat and Siberian tiger. Among the 13 Primates scoring medium there were 10 New World primates and three lemurs. Of 45 Rodentia species, 11 scored medium . Twenty-one Artiodactyls scored medium , including several important wild and domesticated ruminants, such as domesticated cattle, bison, sheep, goat, water buffalo, Masai giraffe, and Tibetan antelope.

        <p>All chiropterans (bats) scored low (N=8) or very low (N=29) (Fig. 1), including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus sinicus ), from which a coronavirus very similar to SARS-CoV-2 was identified (1) Structural analysis of the ACE2/ SARS-CoV-2 S binding interface . We complemented the sequence-identity based scoring scheme with a qualitative approach that combined structural homology modeling and best fit rotamer positioning. We examined the 25 ACE2 binding residues in a subset of 28 representative species (Fig. S1) and 17 sites were variable and not glycosylation sites. First, we assessed the similarity of every contact at the binding interface between two recently solved crystal structures for the human ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S RBD complex in humans, 6M0J and 6WV1 (13,21) . Both structures were in agreement except for the position of S19, which was excluded from subsequent analysis (24) . We then generated homology models, and aligned them to the human ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S RBD 6M0J structure. This showed a high degree of similarity along the C⍺ backbone (25) for each of the 28 species.All chiropterans (bats) scored low (N=8) or very low (N=29) (Fig. 1), including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus sinicus ), from which a coronavirus very similar to SARS-CoV-2 was identified (1) Structural analysis of the ACE2/ SARS-CoV-2 S binding interface .

        <p>Structural analysis of variation in human ACE2 . We applied the same approach used to compare species, sequence identity and protein structural analysis, to examine the variation in ACE binding residues within humans, some of which have been proposed to alter binding affinity (18,(27)(28)(29)(30) . We integrated data from six different sources: dbSNP (31) , 1KGP (32) , Topmed (33) , UK10K (34) and CHINAMAP (28) , and identified a total of 11 variants in ten of the 25 ACE2 binding residues (Dataset S2). All variants found are rare, with allele frequency less than 0.01 in any populations, and less than 0.0007 over all populations. Three of the 11 variants were synonymous changes, seven were conservative missense variants, and one, S19P, was a semi-conservative substitution. S19P has the highest allele frequency of the 11 variants, with a global frequency of 0.0003 (17) . We evaluated, by structural homology, six missense variants. Four were neutral and two weakening (E35K, frequency=0.000016; E35D, frequency=0.000279799). S19P was not included in our structural homology assessment, but a recent study predicted it would increase binding affinity (26) . Thus, with an estimated summed frequency of 0.001, genetic variation in the ACE2 S-binding interface is overall rare, and it is unclear whether the variation that does exist increases or decreases susceptibility to infection.Structural analysis of variation in human ACE2 .

        <p>Evolution of ACE2 across mammals . We next investigated the evolution of ACE2 variation in vertebrates, including how patterns of positive selection compare between bats, a mammalian lineage known to harbor a diversity of coronaviruses (35) , and other mammalian clades. We first inferred the phylogeny of ACE2 using our 410-vertebrate alignment and IQTREE, using the best-fit model of sequence evolution (JTT+F+R7) and rooting the topology on fishes (Dataset S3; Fig. S3). We then assayed sequence conservation with PhyloP (36) . The majority of ACE2 codons are significantly conserved across vertebrates and across mammals, likely reflecting its critical function in the renin-angiotensin system (37) (Dataset S4.1), with ten residues in the ACE2 binding domain exceptionally conserved in Chiroptera and/or Rodentia (Dataset S4.2).Evolution of ACE2 across mammals .

        <p>PhyloP identified lineage-specific acceleration in Chiroptera, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla and Cetaceans relative to mammals (Dataset S4.13-17, Fig. S7). Bats have a particularly high level of accelerated evolution (18 codons; p&lt;0.05). Of these accelerated residues, T27 and M82 are known to be important for binding SARS-CoV-2, with some bat subgroups having amino acids predicted to lead to less favorable binding of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S1, Fig. S8). Surprisingly, a residue that is conserved overall in our 410 species alignment and in the mammalian subset, Q728, is perfectly conserved in all 37 species of bats except for fruit bats (Pteropodidae), which have a substitution from Q to E. These results support the theory that ACE2 is under lineage-specific selective pressures in bats relative to other mammals.PhyloP identified lineage-specific acceleration in Chiroptera, Carnivora, Rodentia, Artiodactyla and Cetaceans relative to mammals (Dataset S4.13-17, Fig. S7).

        <p>Phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in a bat species (1) . However, whether SARS-CoV-2 or the progenitor of this virus was transmitted directly to humans or through an intermediary host is not yet resolved. To determine if amino acid substitution analysis and structural information could be used to identify candidate intermediate host species, we undertook a deep comparative genomic, evolutionary and structural analysis of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor in humans. To accomplish this we drew on the rapidly growing dataset of annotated vertebrate genomes as well as predicted protein sequences from recently acquired whole genome sequences produced by the Genomes 10K-affiliated Bat1K Consortium, Zoonomia, and Vertebrate Genomes Project, and other sources (39,40) . We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of ACE2 orthologs from 410 vertebrate species and made predictions of their likelihood to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S using a score that was based on amino acid substitutions at 25 consensus human ACE2 binding residues (13,21) . We supported these predictions with comprehensive homology modeling of the ACE2 binding site.Phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in a bat species (1) .

        <p>Evolution of ACE2 . Variation of ACE2 in the human population is rare (17) . We examined a large set of ACE2 variants for their potential differences in binding to SARS-CoV-2 S and their relationship to selected and accelerated sites. We found rare variants that would result in missense mutations in 7 out of the 25 binding residues (Dataset S2) . Some of those (e.g. E35K with an AF of 0.00001636) could reduce the virus binding affinity, thus potentially lowering the susceptibility to the virus in a very small fraction of the population. The analysis suggests that some variants (e.g. D38E) might not affect the binding while others (e.g. S19P) have uncertain effects. Further studies are needed to confirm and correctly address recent discoveries (18,27,28) and the data presented here, investigating the possible effect of these rare variants in specific populations.Evolution of ACE2 .

        <p>Bats and other species of interest . Chiroptera (bats) represent a clade of mammals that are of high interest in COVID-19 research because several bat species are known to harbor coronaviruses, including those most closely related to the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (1) . We analyzed ACE2 from 37 bat species of which 8 and 29 scored low and very low , respectively. These results were unexpected because the three Rhinolophus spp. including the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat are major suspects in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, or a closely related virus, to humans (1) . Globally, bats have been shown to harbour the highest diversity of betacoronaviruses in mammals tested (35) and show little pathology carrying these viruses (57) . We found evidence for accelerated evolution at six RBD binding domain residues within the bat lineage, which is more than in any other lineage tested. Bats also had far more sites showing evidence of positive selection, including four binding domain residues, compared to other mammalian orders. This suggests that the diversity observed in bat ACE2 sequences may be driven by selective pressure from coronaviruses. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to use the ACE2 receptor in bats, which challenges a recent study showing that SARS-CoV-2 can infect HeLa cells expressing Rhinolophus sinicus ACE2 (1) . If bats can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus likely uses a different receptor. For example, the MERS-CoV, a betacoronavirus, uses CD26/DPP4 (16) while the porcine transmissible enteritis virus, an alphacoronavirus uses aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) (58) . As detailed above, further in vitro and in vivo infectivity studies are required to fully understand the mode of transmission of susceptibility of bats to SARS-CoV-2.Bats and other species of interest .

However, the masked palm civet ( Paguma larvata ), a member of the Viverridae family that is related to but distinct from Felidae, scored as very low . These results are inconsistent with transfection studies using civet ACE2 receptors expressed in HeLa cells (1) , although these experiments have limitations as discussed above. While carnivores closely related to dogs (dingos, wolves and foxes) all scored low , experimental data supporting infection in dogs were inconsistent (47,50,59) so no conclusions can be drawn.Carnivores .

        <p>Pangolins . Considerable controversy surrounds reports that pangolins can serve as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. Pangolins were proposed as a possible intermediate host (22) (60) . This represents only a small fraction of the threatened species potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. For example, all 20 catarrhine primate species in our analysis, representing three families (Cercopithecidae, Hylobatidae, and Hominidae) scored very high , suggesting that all 185 species of catarrhine primates, most of which are classified Threatened (62), are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, all three species of deer, representatives of a family of ~92 species (Cervidae), scored as high risk, as did species representing Cetacea (baleen and toothed whales), and both groups contain a number of threatened species. Toothed whales have potential for viral outbreaks and have lost function of a gene key to the antiviral response in other mammalian lineages (61) . If they are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 , human-to-animal transmission could pose a risk through sewage outfall (62) and contaminated refuse from cities, commercial vessels and cruise liners (63) .

Presently, there is a tremendous need for animal models for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis, as the only species currently known to be infected and show similar symptoms of COVID-19 is rhesus macaque. Non-human primate models have proven to be highly valuable for other infectious diseases, but are expensive to maintain and numbers of experimental animals are limited.

        <p>Conclusions . We predict that species scored as very high and high for SARS-CoV-2 S binding to ACE2 will have a high probability of becoming infected by the virus. We also predict that many species having a medium score have some risk of infection, and species scored as very low and low are unlikely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 via the ACE2 receptor. Importantly, our predictions are based solely on in silico analyses and must be confirmed by direct experimental data. Until such time, other than for species in which SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated to occur using ACE2, we urge caution not to over-interpret the predictions made in the present study. This is especially important with regards to species, endangered or otherwise, in human care. While species ranked high or medium may be susceptible to infection based on the features of their ACE2 residues, pathological outcomes may be very different among species depending on other mechanisms that could affect virus replication and spread to target cells, tissues, and organs within the host. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that infection in any species occurs via another cellular receptor, as has been shown for other betacoronaviruses. Nonetheless, our predictions provide a useful starting point for selection of appropriate animal models for COVID-19 research and for identification of species that may be at risk for human-to-animal or animal-to-animal transmissions by SARS-CoV-2. The approach we used for ACE2 can be extended to other cellular proteins known to be involved in coronavirus infection and immunity to better understand infection, transmission, inflammatory responses and disease progression.Conclusions .

        <p>Phylogenetic reconstruction of the vertebrate ACE2 species tree . The multiple sequence alignment of 410 ACE2 orthologous protein sequences from mammals, birds, fishes, reptiles and amphibians was used to generate a gene tree using the maximum likelihood method of reconstruction, as implemented in 
            <rs type="software">IQTREE</rs> (80) . The best fit model of sequence evolution was determined using 
            <rs type="software">ModelFinder</rs> (81) and used to generate the species phylogeny. A total of 1000 bootstrap replicates were used to determine node support using 
            <rs type="software">UFBoot</rs> (82) .

        <p>Identifying sites undergoing positive selection . Signatures of site-specific positive selection in the ACE2 receptor were explored using 
            <rs type="software">CODEML</rs>, part of the 
            <rs type="software">Phylogenetic Analysis using Maximum</rs> Likelihood 
            <rs type="software">(PAML</rs>, (83) ) suite of software. Given 
            <rs type="software">CODEML</rs>'s computational complexity, a smaller subset of mammalian taxa (N=64, Dataset S1), which included species from all prediction categories mentioned above, was used for selection analyses. To calculate likelihood-derived dN/dS rates (⍵), 
            <rs type="software">CODEML</rs> utilises both a species tree and a codon alignment. The species tree for all 64 taxa was calculated using 
            <rs type="software">IQTREE</rs> (80) and the inferred best-fit model of sequence evolution (JTT+F+R4). This gene topology was generally in agreement with the 410 taxa tree, however bats were now sister taxa to Perissodactyla. Therefore all selection analyses were run using both the inferred gene tree, and a modified tree with the position of bats manually modified to reflect the 410 taxa topology. All species trees used were unrooted. A codon alignment of the 64 mammals was generated using 
            <rs type="software">pal2nal</rs> (84) with protein alignments generated with 
            <rs type="software">Clustal Omega</rs> (73) and their respective CDS sequences. alignments were generated as above, with the viral species tree inferred using full genome alignments of all strains generated with 
            <rs type="software">Clustal Omega</rs> (73) . Site-test models were applied using 
            <rs type="software">CODEML</rs>, and significant BEB sites identified.

        <p>Analysis for departure from neutral evolutionary rate in ACE2 with PHAST . Neutral models were trained on the specified species sets (Dataset S4) using the REV nucleotide substitution model implemented in 
            <rs type="software">phyloFit</rs> using an expectation maximization algorithm for parameter optimization. The neutral model fit was based on third codon positions to approximate the neutral evolution rate specific to the ACE2 gene, using a 410-species phylogenetic tree generated by 
            <rs type="software">IQTREE</rs> as described above and rooted on fishes. The program 
            <rs type="software">phyloP</rs> was then used to identify codons undergoing accelerated or conserved evolution relative to the neutral model using --features to specify codons, --method LRT --mode CONACC, and --subtree for lineage-specific tests, with p-values thus assigned per codon based on a likelihood ratio test. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (36) and sites with a corrected p-value less than 0.05 were considered significant. 
            <rs type="software">PhyloFit</rs> and 
            <rs type="software">phyloP</rs> are both part of the 
            <rs type="software">PHAST</rs> package v
            <rs type="version">1.4</rs> (85,86) .
