        <p>BACKGROUND: With advances in antiretroviral therapy, most deaths in people with HIV are now attributable to noncommunicable illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease. We determine the association between HIV and cardiovascular disease, and estimate the national, regional, and global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV.BACKGROUND: With advances in antiretroviral therapy, most deaths in people with HIV are now attributable to noncommunicable illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease. We determine the association between HIV and cardiovascular disease, and estimate the national, regional, and global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV.</p>
        <p>We conducted a systematic review across 5 databases from inception to August 2016 for longitudinal studies of cardiovascular disease in HIV infection. A random-effects meta-analysis across 80 studies was used to derive the pooled rate and risk of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV. We then estimated the temporal changes in the population-attributable fraction and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from HIV-associated cardiovascular disease from 1990 to 2015 at a regional and global level. National cardiovascular DALYs associated with HIV for 2015 were derived for 154 of the 193 United Nations member states. The main outcome measure was the pooled estimate of the rate and risk of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV and the national, regional, and global estimates of DALYs from cardiovascular disease associated with HIV.We conducted a systematic review across 5 databases from inception to August 2016 for longitudinal studies of cardiovascular disease in HIV infection.

        <p>In 793 635 people living with HIV and a total follow-up of 3.5 million person-years, the crude rate of cardiovascular disease was 61.8 (95% CI, 45.8-83.4) per 10 000 person-years. In comparison with individuals without HIV, the risk ratio for cardiovascular disease was 2.16 (95% CI, 1.68-2.77).

        <p>We anticipated heterogeneity between studies when estimating both the crude incidence rates and the risk ratio because of different study designs, methods of analysis and varying adjustment, and geographical and population differences. We therefore used a random-effects model with the maximum likelihood estimator to account for both withinand between-study heterogeneity. 25 Heterogeneity, when estimating the pooled estimate of the risk ratio, was examined using the standard I 2 test. Publication or small-study bias was assessed using the regression test, and the trimand-fill method was used for correcting funnel plot asymmetry. Risk of bias was assessed at a study level according to the level of adjustment undertaken (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Studies at low risk of bias were defined if adjustment of age, sex, and at least 1 other covariate was undertaken. Moderate risk was defined as adjustment of at least age or sex, and studies were classified as high-risk if no adjustment was undertaken.

This comprised 793 635 people with HIV and a total follow-up of 3.5 million person-years. The crude incidence rate for cardiovascular disease per 10 000 person-years was 61.8 (95% CI, 45.8-83.4).

        <p>A further 17 estimates from 16 studies were identified to estimate the pooled risk ratio of incident cardiovascular disease in individuals with HIV infection (Table, Figure 2B). Studies originated mainly from Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific region with few studies from low-and middle-income nations (Table ) and primarily involving black and white participants (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement). The majority of studies used physician diagnosis or the International Classification of Diseases coding system to define cardiovascular disease. The pooled risk ratio was 2.16 (95% CI, 1.68-2.77) (Figure 2B). The risk ratio when stratified by type of event was 2.36 (95% CI, 1.50-3.70) for any cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction and stroke), 1.79 (95% CI, 1.54-2.08) for myocardial infarction, and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.43-4.61) for stroke.

        <p>In this systematic review, meta-analysis, and burden assessment, we evaluated the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, and estimated the national, regional, and global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV infection. We make a number of important and novel observations. First, the crude rate for incident cardiovascular disease was 60 per 10 000 person years and is comparable to other high-risk cardiovascular groups, such as diabetes mellitus. 42 Second, the risk of incident cardiovascular disease was 2-fold higher in people living with HIV. Third, the number of DALYs attributable to HIV-associated cardiovascular disease has increased 3-fold over the past 2 decades, but has now plateaued. Finally, there were major regional variations in both the attributable fraction and the rates of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV, with much of the burden seen in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Asia and the Pacific.In this systematic review, meta-analysis, and burden assessment, we evaluated the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, and estimated the national, regional, and global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV infection.

        <p>Many factors may have affected the estimates that we have derived and are based on several assumptions that merit discussion. First, the pooled risk ratios used to calculate the population-attributable fraction and the subsequent cardiovascular burden were primarily obtained from developed nations but were applied to all regions. This approach is ubiquitous in these types of analyses 43,44 and highlights the paucity of data from these regions. In a recent analysis evaluating the global burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to hypertension and obesity, &lt;10% of cohorts originated from low-and middle-income nations. 44,45 Second, the incidence rate does not consider competing risk from noncardiovascular mortality. This would further underestimate the rate of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV, especially in earlier studies when antiretroviral therapy was not widely available. Third, although many of the individual studies evaluating the risk ratio of cardiovascular disease adjusted for important traditional risk factors, there remains the risk of residual confounding.

Fourth, the pooled relative risk estimates used to calculate the ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE population-attributable fraction for DALY for ischemic heart and cerebrovascular disease was obtained solely from studies including acute myocardial infarction or stroke and so did not specifically include estimates for angina pectoris or other chronic manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. However, relative to the overall cardiovascular DALY attributable to ischemic heart disease, the burden from angina is minimal. 10 Therefore, the impact of this limitation on the overall burden estimate is likely to be small. Fifth, the majority of studies evaluating the risk of cardiovascular disease in people living with HIV have recruited participants before 2010, with a large number conducted in the previous century. The epidemiology of HIV diagnosis and care has changed significantly over the past 2 decades, with better provision of antiretroviral therapy and improved survival, resulting in an increased prevalence of HIV. 46 Sixth, when calculating the burden at a global and regional level, we have made the assumption that the prevalence of HIV infection in the younger age group (15-49 years old) is consistent across the entire age range. There is a paucity of data in the prevalence of HIV in the older population, especially in high-prevalence regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. 47 However, analysis of the populations in these regions shows that the prevalence in the older population remains similar to that of the 15-to 49-year group. 47 Finally, we noticed substantial heterogeneity for our overall pooled risk ratios. The source for this degree of heterogeneity is likely to be multifactorial and reflect differences in population demographics, sample size and small-study effect, patient characteristics, selection or publication bias, and case ascertainment bias because the majority of data were based on national statistics. Many studies have evaluated the association between HIV infection and the risk of atherosclerotic disease including the potential role of antiretroviral therapy. 17,[48][49][50] This is the first study to review and metaanalyze systematically the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, and to estimate the burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV. The mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. 17 Possible mechanisms include endothelial dysfunction 51 and increased systemic 13 and coronary arterial inflammation 14 associated with elevated inflammatory markers. 13 Furthermore, patients with HIV have more traditional metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease 17 including dyslipidemia, 15 insulin resistance and abnormal glucose homeostasis, 16 and abnormalities in body fat composition.

The prevalence of HIV varies by region with the greatest proportions seen in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia Pacific region. Cardiovascular disease now accounts for &gt;10% of all morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa with rates that are comparable to high-income regions. Consequently, the sub-Saharan region accounted for half of all DALYs from cardiovascular disease attributable to HIV. The population-attributable fraction of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease in the UNAIDS high-priority countries was up to 25% and similar to traditional lifestyle, metabolic, and environmental risk factors. 23,24 The combined burden of HIV and cardiovascular disease in the UNAIDS high-priority countries is of growing concern and has important implications with respect to regional health policies, guidelines, and resource allocation. Risk stratification and identification of patients at intermediate or high risk of future cardiovascular disease are already challenging in resource-limited nations. 55 Furthermore, traditional risk scores perform poorly because they consistently underestimate risk in HIV-infected populations. 35,56,57 Whether patients living with HIV should be considered high risk and started on primary prevention, such as statin therapy, remains unclear. A recent randomized controlled trial of rosuvastatin in patients with HIV demonstrated a reduction in carotid artery intimamedia thickness despite these individuals having low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at baseline. 58 Although the latest international guidelines have expanded the use of lipid-lowering therapy ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE in the general population, over two-thirds of people living with HIV with evidence of high-risk morphology coronary atherosclerotic plaque would not have been recommended for statin therapy. 59 The REPRIEVE study (Randomised Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) is now underway to evaluate the efficacy of statin therapy in people living with HIV who are deemed low-risk based on traditional risk scores. 60,61especially in the low-and middle-income nations, and is likely to be a product of both temporal increases in the prevalence of HIV and the morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.
