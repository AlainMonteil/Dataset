        <p>Background Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and affects people regardless of country, age group, or sex. Using the most recent evidentiary and analytical framework from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), we produced location-specific, age-specific, and sex-specific estimates of diabetes prevalence and burden from 1990 to 2021, the proportion of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in 2021, the proportion of the type 2 diabetes burden attributable to selected risk factors, and projections of diabetes prevalence through 2050.</p>
        <p>Estimates of diabetes prevalence and burden were computed in 204 countries and territories, across 25 age groups, for males and females separately and combined; these estimates comprised lost years of healthy life, measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; defined as the sum of years of life lost [YLLs] and years lived with disability [YLDs]). We used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach to estimate deaths due to diabetes, incorporating 25 666 location-years of data from vital registration and verbal autopsy reports in separate total (including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) and type-specific models. Other forms of diabetes, including gestational and monogenic diabetes, were not explicitly modelled. Total and type 1 diabetes prevalence was estimated by use of a Bayesian meta-regression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to analyse 1527 location-years of data from the scientific literature, survey microdata, and insurance claims; type 2 diabetes estimates were computed by subtracting type 1 diabetes from total estimates. Mortality and prevalence estimates, along with standard life expectancy and disability weights, were used to calculate YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs. When appropriate, we extrapolated estimates to a hypothetical population with a standardised age structure to allow comparison in populations with different age structures. We used the comparative risk assessment framework to estimate the risk-attributable type 2 diabetes burden for 16 risk factors falling under risk categories including environmental and occupational factors, tobacco use, high alcohol use, high body-mass index (BMI), dietary factors, and low physical activity. Using a regression framework, we forecast type 1 and type 2 diabetes prevalence through 2050 with Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and high BMI as predictors, respectively. Findings In 2021, there were 529 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 500-564) people living with diabetes worldwide, and the global age-standardised total diabetes prevalence was 6•1% (5•8-6•5). At the super-region level, the highest age-standardised rates were observed in north Africa and the Middle East (9•3% [8•7-9•9]) and, at the regional level, in Oceania (12•3% [11•5-13•0]). Nationally, Qatar had the world's highest age-specific prevalence of diabetes, at 76•1% (73•1-79•5) in individuals aged 75-79 years. Total diabetes prevalence-especially among older adults-primarily reflects type 2 diabetes, which in 2021 accounted for 96•0% (95•1-96•8) of diabetes cases and 95•4% (94•9-95•9) of diabetes DALYs worldwide. In 2021, 52•2% (25•5-71•8) of global type 2 diabetes DALYs were attributable to high BMI. The contribution of high BMI to type 2 diabetes DALYs rose by 24•3% (18•5-30•4) worldwide between 1990 and 2021. By 2050, more than 1•31 billion (1•22-1•39) people are projected to have diabetes, with expected age-standardised total diabetes prevalence rates greater than 10% in two super-regions: 16•8% (16•1-17•6) in north Africa and the Middle East and 11•3% (10•8-11•9) in Latin America and Caribbean. By 2050, 89 (43•6%) of 204 countries and territories will have an age-standardised rate greater than 10%.</p>
        <p>Interpretation Diabetes remains a substantial public health issue. Type 2 diabetes, which makes up the bulk of diabetes cases, is largely preventable and, in some cases, potentially reversible if identified and managed early in the disease course. However, all evidence indicates that diabetes prevalence is increasing worldwide, primarily due to a rise in obesity caused by multiple factors. Preventing and controlling type 2 diabetes remains an ongoing challenge. It is essential to better understand disparities in risk factor profiles and diabetes burden across populations, to inform strategies to successfully control diabetes risk factors within the context of multiple and complex drivers.</p>

        <p>Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease characterised by elevated blood glucose concentrations related to the effects of abnormal β-cell biology on insulin action. [1][2][3][4][5] According to estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, diabetes was the eighth leading cause of death and disability combined in the world, with nearly 460 million people across every country and age group living with the disease in 2019. 6 Diabetes represents a substantial burden to health-care systems, 2,[7][8][9] with estimates by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) indicating that 537 million people worldwide had diabetes in 2021, resulting in health expenditures of US$966 billion globally, forecast to reach more than $1054 billion by 2045. 4,10 The 2016 NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) Study projected that the probability of meeting global targets to halt the rising diabetes prevalence by 2025 was lower than 1% for women and even lower for men. 11 Diabetes is also a major risk factor for ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 12 which were estimated by GBD 2019 to be the first and second leading causes, respectively, of the global disease burden. 6 Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common forms of the disease and are diagnosed through well established criteria. 1,2,4 Type 1 diabetes often develops during childhood, while type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic component and a robust association with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. 10,13 Although prevention and management approaches differ between diabetes types, there are well established strategies to reduce the disease burden, including limiting risk factors for type 2 diabetes, 2 increasing access to treatment such as insulin, 14 and enhancing the health-system infrastructure. 2,14,15 However, social determinants of health have led to considerable disparities across populations in risk factor profiles,</p>
        <p>Evidence before this study The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) generates publicly available estimates of total (inclusive of type 1 and type 2) diabetes deaths, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disabilityadjusted life-years (DALYs) at the global, super-region, region, and country and territory levels. Since GBD 2017, type-specific estimates have also been produced. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) generates worldwide estimates of diabetes deaths and prevalence for type 1 diabetes in people aged 19 years or younger and for total diabetes in those aged 20-79 years, with the most recent estimates produced in 2021, and has projected the future prevalence of total diabetes through 2045. The NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) published global estimates in 2016 that focused on total diabetes prevalence in individuals aged 18 years and older and projected the probability that diabetes would not continue to increase by 2025. In the present study, we estimated non-fatal outcomes due to diabetes by conducting systematic reviews in PubMed from Jan 1, 1990, to Oct 16, 2018 (see appendix section 4.1.1), carrying out opportunistic searches from Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2021, and incorporating data shared by country collaborators and WHO in addition to insurance claims data. To estimate diabetes risk relative to risk factor exposure, separate systematic reviews were done for each risk factor by accessing various databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) with endpoints ranging from 2019 to 2022 (see appendix sections 5.1.1-5.1. 6).</p>
        <p>Global estimates are essential to policy makers, health-care professionals, health researchers, and individuals with diabetes, but only GBD data and methods are exhaustive across diabetes type, age, and sex, for 204 countries and territories; explicitly quantify the proportion of the diabetes burden attributable to specific risk factors; predict diabetes prevalence to 2050; and are designed to capture both undiagnosed and diagnosed cases. Various research groups have made use of publicly available GBD data to report on the diabetes burden and risk factors and produce short-term forecasts. Our study, as part of the larger GBD analytical enterprise, leverages the newest available data and methods. We apply and detail the updated GBD analytical and evidentiary framework to generate comprehensive, type-specific estimates of diabetes burden for all regions of the world, across the human lifespan, for males and females separately and combined. We also quantify the proportion of type 2 diabetes attributable to 16 selected risk factors concurrently to highlight the main drivers of diabetes. The continued global spread of diabetes presents a massive public health challenge. The location-specific and populationspecific data we present on the likely trajectory of diabetes in the coming decades are crucial to inform policy makers and public health professionals as they prepare to address the impending threat to the communities they serve.</p>
        <p>Policy makers and public health officials worldwide are increasingly concerned by soaring diabetes prevalence rates and their implications for health-care systems and societies. At the current pace, we project that more than 1•31 billion people will be living with diabetes by 2050, most of whom will have type 2 diabetes. Addressing escalating challenges to diabetes prevention and barriers to managing the disease and its complications will become a requisite component of health-care provision worldwide. There is an urgent need to tackle adverse trends in the prevalence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes, particularly obesity. Without new and far-reaching approaches targeting not only risk factors but also the social and logistical barriers that limit access to treatment and medical attention, diabetes will continue to exert increasingly negative effects on the quality of life of individuals, health of populations, and the strength of global economies for decades to come.</p>
        <p>For estimates from GBD 2019 see https://vizhub.healthdata. org/gbd-compare access to screening and treatment, and available health services. [16][17][18][19] Hence, the burden of diabetes-related deaths and disability, as well as their drivers, varies widely. 14,[20][21][22][23][24][25][26] The Lancet Commission on diabetes published in 2020 highlights the unequal burden of the disease on people in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), reporting that 80% of diabetes cases occur in LMICs. 2 The Lancet Commission noted that, in addition to underfunded and ill-prepared health-care systems, LMICs are beset by socioeconomic challenges such as poor nutrition, poverty, and physical inactivity, and emphasised the pressing need for accurate, focused data to guide the development of effective programmes targeting these factors. It was further argued as imperative to accurately identify and characterise the populations at highest risk-defined by their demographic features and exposure to key risk factors-in addition to forecasting how the diabetes burden is expected to increase along these dimensions in the future.</p>
        <p>In response to this need and in support of recent calls to action sounded by the global community, as embodied in initiatives such as the 2020 Lancet Commission on diabetes and the 2021 WHO Global Diabetes Compact, our work applies and explicates the newly updated methodological framework of GBD to generate estimates of total diabetes and type-specific (type 1 and type 2) diabetes prevalence and burden from 1990 to 2021. This approach allows us to break down these estimates with a high degree of granularity by location, age, and sex, and to present a more holistic picture of the landscape of diabetes-including drivers of the disease and how they have changed over time, as well as forecasting global and location-specific diabetes prevalence through 2050.</p>
        <p>This manuscript was produced as part of the GBD Collaborator Network and in accordance with the GBD Protocol. 27</p>
        <p>To obtain the data used in models, GBD conducts systematic reviews and opportunistic searches, and utilises data shared by country collaborators and WHO. Data seeking is iterative and continuously in process in order to identify new sources. Information on data seeking efforts conducted for GBD iterations through GBD 2019 has been published previously 6,28,29 and is provided in the appendix (section 4.1.1). For this study, we identified 27 193 data sources to which we applied the methodological and evidentiary framework provided by GBD. The present analysis does not reflect the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diabetes prevalence and burden since these data were not available at the time of the analysis.</p>
        <p>We report primarily on diabetes prevalence and burden because these metrics are particularly salient for characterising type 2 diabetes and capturing aspects of the rapid global rise of diabetes; however, we also provide mortality estimates in the appendix (table S24). Moreover, mortality data were included in the calculation of our principal metrics: prevalence (via cause-specific mortality rates used in the compartmental disease modelling process) and years of life lost (YLLs; via measures of expected age of mortality), and, by extension, disabilityadjusted life-years (DALYs), which are the sum of YLLs and years lived with disability (YLDs).</p>
        <p>We report many estimates generated as agestandardised results (ie, extrapolated to a hypothetical population with a standardised age structure) to allow comparison of estimates made in populations with different age structures. The standard population was calculated with the non-weighted mean of the agespecific population proportional distributions for all national locations with populations greater than 5 million in 2019 from GBD 2019.</p>
        <p>This study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) statement (appendix table S1). 30</p>
        <p>There were 25 666 location-years of death data included in the fatal model (appendix section 3.1). We used vital registration data and verbal autopsy 6 data coded as diabetes since 1980 (appendix section 3.2.1). Codes for causes that either did not lead to death or were intermediate causes, but for which diabetes could have been the underlying cause-referred to as garbage codes 31 -were eligible for inclusion in the diabetes model 6 (appendix section 3.2.1). Approximately 11•1% of deaths coded to diabetes were reassigned from garbage codes.</p>
        <p>More than 50% of deaths coded to diabetes did not specify a type. We developed a log-linear regression model to predict the type-specific proportion of deaths among those coded to unspecified diabetes. The model was informed by data that specified the diabetes type and, for a given country, included two parameters: first, country-years in which more than 50% of deaths due to diabetes were coded as being due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes; and second, for country-years with type-specific coding, those in which 70% or more of type-specific deaths for people older than 25 years were coded as type 2 diabetes. We included prevalence of obesity as a covariate and redistributed deaths accordingly to type 1 or type 2 diabetes. More details are provided in the appendix (section 3.2.3).</p>
        <p>We ran separate mortality models for type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and total diabetes. We assumed that all deaths due to diabetes in people younger than 15 years were from type 1 diabetes. We used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), 6 a highly automated analytical tool that selects an ensemble of mixed-effects or spatiotemporal Gaussian regression models of mortality rates or cause fractions with varying combinations of predictive covariates. Ensembles were For more on the WHO Global Diabetes Compact see https:// www.who.int/initiatives/the-who-global-diabetes-compact See Online for appendix selected on the basis of out-of-sample predictive validity testing. We included 19 covariates, six associated with type 1 diabetes and 13 associated with type 2 diabetes, which were selected on the basis of known or postulated relationships with development or management of diabetes (appendix section 3.3).</p>
        <p>The reference case definition for diabetes was a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater, or a person using insulin or diabetes medication. We included any populationrepresentative source that provided individual-level data or reported the prevalence or incidence of diabetes defined by the source's glucose threshold from tests of FPG, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ), oral glucose tolerance (OGTT), or post-prandial glucose (PPG), or any population-repre sentative source that reported mean FPG and uncertainty around the estimate. 32 We also used insurance claims data from the USA and Taiwan (province of China), since these were locations for which we had access to insurance claims. We included studies reporting the incidence of type 1 diabetes. We incorporated data found through systematic reviews conducted from Jan 1, 1990, to Oct 16, 2018 (appendix section 4.1.1), 6,28,29 and carried out opportunistic literature searches from Jan 1, 1990, to Dec 31, 2021. Between 2020 and 2021, we reviewed all data provided by GBD collaborators through the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and prospectively sought individual-level data from the WHO STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) surveys (appendix section 4.1.1). There were 1527 location-years of data from 172 countries (84•3% of the 204 countries and territories included in GBD) used in the diabetes modelling process (appendix section 4.1.1).</p>
        <p>Where possible, we used individual-level data from surveys that collected glucose measurements to calculate age-sex-year-location-specific prevalence estimates and used the information included in the survey metadata to inform how the sampling strategy, sampling frame, and sampling weights were incorporated into the estimates and uncertainty.</p>
        <p>We used the meta-regression Bayesian, regularised, trimmed (MR-BRT) 33 tool to generate coefficients that were used to adjust estimates from studies that did not define diabetes with the reference definition (appendix section 4.2.2). For data from people aged younger than 15 years, we assumed that all diabetes cases were type 1 diabetes and that all patients had sought hospital care due to their insulin dependence. We also converted population-level mean FPG estimates to diabetes prevalence estimates (appendix section 4.2.2).</p>
        <p>We ran separate non-fatal models for type 1 diabetes and total diabetes. We used a hierarchical Bayesian metaregression modelling tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, 6 to estimate prevalence due to diabetes from 1990 to 2021. Differential equations in DisMod-MR 2.1 produce a consistent set of estimates based on data on prevalence, incidence, and cause-specific mortality rates generated from the fatal modelling process. In the type 1 diabetes model, we included three predictive covariates: proportion of livebirths in women aged 35 years and older and maternal education (years per capita) as predictors of type 1 diabetes incidence; and the Healthcare Access and Quality Index (HAQ Index) 34 as a predictor of type 1 diabetes excess mortality rate. We assumed there was no remission (ie, no cure). In the total diabetes model, we included two predictive covariates-prevalence of obesity and year as predictors of diabetes prevalence-and assumed that annual remission could be no more than 1% (appendix sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2). Because most data sources in adults reported prevalence of total diabetes or did not use a robust strategy to exclude people with type 1 diabetes, we were not confident in the accuracy of the data available that were labelled as type 2 diabetes. As an alternative, we subtracted the year-age-sex-location-specific estimates of type 1 diabetes from total diabetes to produce estimates of type 2 diabetes (appendix section 4.3.3).</p>
        <p>The methods for calculating YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs have been described elsewhere, 6 but in brief, YLLs were the product of the number of deaths and standard life expectancy at each age of death, 35 and YLDs were the product of the prevalence of each sequela and its corresponding disability weight. 36 We included estimates for four diabetic sequelae for each type of diabetes: neuropathy, diabetic foot, lower limb amputation, and vision loss due to retinopathy. Each sequela had separate disability weights that were used to calculate YLDs (appendix sections 4.2.4, 4.3.4, and 4.4). YLDs were corrected for comorbidities with all other causes of ill health, assuming independence and a multiplicative function. DALYs were the sum of YLLs and YLDs.</p>
        <p>We modelled 16 detailed risk factors for diabetes: ambient particulate matter pollution, household air pollution from solid fuels, smoking, second-hand smoke, high alcohol use, high body-mass index (BMI), diet low in fruits, diet low in vegetables, diet low in whole grains, diet high in red meat, diet high in processed meat, diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages, diet low in fibre, low physical activity, high air temperature, and low air temperature (appendix section 5.1). These risk factors fall into six categories: environmental or occupational, tobacco use, high alcohol use, high BMI, dietary risks, and low physical activity. All risk factors have been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes, but high air temperature and low air temperature are the only risk factors associated with type 1 diabetes. 28 To quantify the relationship between each risk factor and diabetes, we carried out meta-analyses following the comparative risk assessment approach, a framework used by GBD since 2002 that is predicated on a causal web of hierarchically organised, potentially overlapping health risks. 29,37 For each risk factor analysed here, we estimated the relative risk of diabetes as a function of risk exposure, using the following methods, which have been extensively detailed elsewhere. 33,38 In brief, we did a literature review of studies that estimated diabetes risk relative to risk factor exposure and extracted data to input into a set of flexible meta-regression procedures using regularised splines to estimate risk functions, as an alternative to imposing a log-linear risk-outcome relationship. Accuracy was further improved by using a robust likelihood-based approach-least-trimmed squares-to detect and trim 10% of the outlying data, testing and adjusting for bias related to study design, and integrating over exposure ranges to account for inconsistency in exposure levels between data sources.</p>
        <p>Following methods established previously, 28 we used DisMod-MR 2.1 or spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to estimate exposure distributions for each risk factor by age, sex, year, and location, and further determined the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), the counterfactual level of exposure that would minimise the risk of diabetes, on the basis of epidemiological evidence. Exposure, relative risk estimates, and TMRELs were used to calculate population attributable fractions (PAFs) for each risk factor by location, age, sex, and year. PAFs quantify the proportional reduction in diabetes that would occur if exposure to the given risk factor was reduced to the TMREL. PAFs were multiplied by metrics of disease burden-in this instance, DALYs-to estimate the risk-attributable burden.</p>
        <p>We used forecasted Socio-demographic Index (SDI) 39 as a predictor in a regression model to estimate the prevalence of type 1 diabetes and forecasted BMI as the predictor for estimating the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. These metrics were forecast through 2050, by age, sex, year, and location. 40 For each location (l), age (a), sex (s), and year (y), we logit-transformed the GBD 2019 diabetes prevalence estimates logit(Y l,a,s,y ) and used a fixed coefficient (β 1 ) on SDI only for type 1 diabetes (equation 1) and BMI for type 2 diabetes (equation 2) over time, and a random intercept (α).</p>
        <p>We computed the difference between the GBD estimates in rate space and the forecasted estimates for 2021 and shifted the forecasting trend through 2050 to align with that of GBD. To calculate the number of cases, we used the forecasted population multiplied by the corresponding predicted prevalence. Population forecasts are described by Vollset and colleagues. 40</p>
        <p>At each modelling step described above, parameter uncertainty was incorporated by randomly drawing 100 samples from each age-sex-location-year-specific parameter distribution and propagating this uncertainty forward through each subsequent step of the analysis. Likewise, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates were calculated by generating 100 random draws from the estimate distribution and taking the 2•5th and 97•5th percentile values across the 100 draws.</p>
        <p>All count data reported are presented to three significant figures, while rates and percentages are presented to one decimal place.</p>
        <p>Diabetes estimates were generated for 204 countries and territories that are grouped on the basis of epidemiological patterns into seven super-regions, with these superregions further grouped into 21 regions based on geographical and epidemiological similarity (see appendix section 7, table S18, for the full GBD location hierarchy).</p>
        <p>All codes used for these analyses are publicly available online. Analyses were carried out with 
            <rs type="software">R</rs> (version

        <p>The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the writing of the report.</p>
        <p>In 2021, there were 529 million (95% UI 500-564) people of all ages, worldwide, living with diabetes, yielding a global age-standardised prevalence of 6•1% (5•8-6•5; figure 1). To facilitate comparison, we re-stratified our results into age groups reported by IDF and NCD-RisC. 4,11 1).</p>
        <p>The global age-standardised total diabetes prevalence was higher in males than in females (6•5% [95% UI 6•2-7•0] vs 5•8% [5•4-6•1]), with a male-to-female sex ratio of 1•14 (1•13-1•15). The ratio varied geographically, from 1•26 (1•24-1•28) in the high-income super-region to 0•96 (0•94-0•97) in the Latin America and Caribbean super-region. At the regional level, the age-standardised diabetes prevalence in males was 1•40 (1•30-1•48) times higher than in females in central sub-Saharan Africa, but prevalence among females was more than 10% higher than in males in central Latin America, southern sub-Saharan Africa, and the Caribbean. In 64 (31•4%) countries and territories, age-standardised diabetes prevalence was lower in males than in females, and in six countries-Azerbaijan, Haiti, Laos, Mauritania, Zimbabwe, and Belize-prevalence in males was more than 20% lower than in females. Of the 140 (68•6%) countries and territories where diabetes was more prevalent in males than in females, in three countries-Angola, Uganda, and Gabon-the male prevalence was more than 50% higher than the female prevalence (appendix figure S24). [10•8-11•9]). The age-standardised diabetes prevalence rate is projected to exceed 10% in 89 (43•6%) countries and territories and to surpass 20% in 24 (11•8%) countries and territories. Every country and territory in three regions-Oceania, north Africa and the Middle East, and central Latin America-is projected to have a diabetes prevalence rate exceeding 10% by 2050. In 13 of 18 countries and territories in Oceania, ten of 21 countries in north Africa and the Middle East, and one country in the Caribbean, the diabetes prevalence will be greater than 20% by 2050. There are no countries and territories where diabetes prevalence rates are expected to decrease (appendix table S23).</p>
        <p>The projected increase in total diabetes prevalence is expected to be driven by type 2 diabetes. The agestandardised global prevalence of type 2 diabetes is projected to rise by 61</p>
        <p>The international community has become increasingly aware that diabetes is a monumental global health threat posing increasing challenges to public health and healthcare systems worldwide. WHO has identified diabetes as one of three target diseases in its WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs, 41 and the WHO Global Diabetes Compact was established in 2021 to improve access to health care for, and work closely with, those living with diabetes. The UN uses diabetes treatment as an indicator of countries' health-care systems when assessing universal health coverage objectives 42 and has established a target of reducing rates of premature death due to diabetes and other non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030, as detailed in Goal 3 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 43 To drive improvements in diabetes prevention and care, the Lancet Commission on diabetes 2 called for an increased reliance on high-quality data, with a focus on LMICs, to allow policy makers to better understand risks and define needs.</p>
        <p>To contribute to this undertaking, as part of GBD we generated estimates of diabetes prevalence and burden, stratified by geographical and demographic factors; examined the contribution of leading risk factors; and forecast location-specific diabetes prevalence in 2050. There were an estimated 529 million people living with diabetes in 2021, a number we project will more than double to about 1•31 billion by 2050. The global agestandardised diabetes prevalence rate in 2021 was 6•1%, with highs of 9•3% in the north Africa and Middle East super-region and 12•3% in the Oceania region. Diabetes was especially prevalent in people aged 65 years and older in every location, but in some locations the prevalence rates were high even in younger adults, exceeding 10% among those aged 30-34 years in ten countries, all in Oceania.</p>
        <p>Because diabetes prevalence rates are driven almost entirely by type 2 diabetes, which accounted for more than 96% of diabetes cases worldwide in 2021, much of the following discussion will focus on type 2 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Our estimates showed high BMI to be the primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes, contributing more than 50% of global DALYs in 2021. The association between high BMI and type 2 diabetes has intensified in recent decades, with the proportion of global type 2 diabetes DALYs attributable to high BMI growing by nearly 25% between 1990 and 2021. By 2050, we project a global increase in age-standardised type 2 diabetes prevalence of more than 60%, with increases of more than 70% in six regions: north Africa and the Middle East, east Asia, central sub-Saharan Africa, southern sub-Saharan Africa, central Latin America, and Australasia.</p>
        <p>Major behavioural shifts and changes in food systems contributing to high BMI include greater availability of shelf-stable and high-calorie products; limited financial and proximal access to healthy food options; increased consumption of ultra-processed foods 44 and fat, sugar, and animal products; and reductions in physical activity related to global work and transportation trends. 45 Particularly in low-income and middle-income populations, the shift away from a traditional diet to an industrialised one has been abrupt and is associated with considerable increases in nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. 46 In some instances, high type 2 diabetes prevalence rates might also be partly associated with a population-specific genetic disposition to developing diabetes. 47 A high diabetes burden in LMICs is also related to economic and sociopolitical challenges, including limited health spending on diabetes 10 and inadequate or incomplete coverage for pharmacological treatment. Fewer than one in ten people with diabetes in LMICs receive coverage for comprehensive diabetes treatment; Oceania, for example, has the lowest medication coverage in the world despite its very high prevalence rates. 16 The regional variation in sex differences in agestandardised diabetes prevalence rates revealed by our estimates is probably also related to variation in patterns in and the impact of obesity on type 2 diabetes, socioeconomic factors, and biological and hormonal differences. 48 Evidence suggests that males might develop type 2 diabetes at lower BMI thresholds and might be more insulin resistant than females. 49 Moreover, in a study of diabetes treatment coverage in LMICs, females had better treatment coverage than males. 16 Conversely, obesity tends to be more common in females, 48 and diabetes treatments rarely account for reported differences in the risk of developing diabetes at different ages between males and females, which are likely to be due to the impact of a combination of genetic, hormonal, and psychosocial dimensions. 50 Although obesity is theoretically reversible 28,51,52 and addressing it could provide the biggest opportunity to limit the advance of diabetes, current trends suggest that obesity rates are likely to continue to climb. 45 Various interventions and policies to address obesity have been developed and studied, [53][54][55][56] but no programme to date has shown long-term, sustained, population-level reductions in obesity. 57 This is probably because no strategy has attempted to deal with the multiple factors that potentially contribute to obesity. Creating change that relies on behavioural and structural shifts in interconnected, complex, and dynamic systems requires a multifaceted, long-term approach with contributions from policy makers, regulators, educators, public health officials, and the medical community. 58 This is clearly not a simple challenge.</p>
        <p>In 2022, the WHO Global Diabetes Compact outlined five diabetes targets to reach by 2030, 59 focused on addressing metabolic risks, access to medication, and diagnosis. Although 77 countries, representing every region and socioeconomic level, have created recommendations, guidelines, and targets to monitor and control diabetes in their populations, [60][61][62] preparedness varies considerably between countries. A survey of 160 WHO member states revealed that approximately 60% have conducted national surveys of blood glucose concentrations, 50% have a diabetes registry, and 80% have an action plan in place. 63 Ultimately, effective testing, diagnosis, treatment, and diabetes control are lacking, particularly in LMICs. 17 As our forecasts suggest that nearly 50% of the increases in diabetes prevalence will be due to changing demographic profiles, countries will need to invest in health systems to handle the surge in expected patients.</p>
        <p>The outlook for a healthy future is further marred by the lack of sustained progress in strategies designed to remediate diabetes. 64 Interventions that have yielded successful results for more than 2 years in people with type 2 diabetes involve bodyweight loss through aggressive control of calorie intake and physical activity or bariatric surgery. [65][66][67][68] Both options involve close oversight and are unlikely to be scalable at a population level globally. Pharmacological agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 agonists have shown some promising results in weight reduction and cardiovascular protection in individuals with type 2 diabetes, 69,70 but the viability of these interventions at the population level remains unclear. Moreover, disparities in medication coverage remain widespread. 2,16 Early diagnosis, patient education, and regular visits to health-care providers can offer clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers opportunities for potentially effective early intervention through pharmacological approaches and other strategies such as lifestyle changes. 71,72 Evidence from studies done in China, Finland, and the USA suggests that these interventions can prevent or at least delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. [73][74][75] Few countries have health-care systems, however, that are positioned to take a proactive approach or possess the infrastructure to prioritise early interventions. Developing and implemen ting strategies that will have long-lasting impacts at the population level remains a persistent challenge.</p>
        <p>Although this study does not explicitly report the impact of diabetes on diseases such as chronic kidney disease, ischaemic heart disease, and cancer, since these relationships are captured in the GBD risk factor framework via high fasting plasma glucose, the impact of diabetes extends beyond the results presented here. Strategies and policies aimed at mitigating the diabetes burden should also consider the additional nuance that diabetes can lead to irreversible microvascular damage and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality due to other infectious and non-communicable diseases. 28,51,52 Furthermore, efforts that succeed in halting the rise in diabetes could mitigate or delay associated health complications if implemented early. [76][77][78][79][80] These are important considerations given that in many places in the world, increases in disability due to diabetes have outpaced diabetes mortality. 81,82 In addition to the estimates presented here, previous studies have reported global diabetes estimates from earlier rounds of GBD, and two other organisations, the IDF and NCD-RisC, have also generated global and multi-country estimates of diabetes for specific age groups. 4,11 Differences between estimates produced by GBD and IDF or NCD-RisC are likely to be due to differences in methods, case inclusion criteria, and data sources used. For example, our GBD analysis deliberately excluded sources that rely on self-reported diabetes data because we assumed that reporting bias would change over time and across location (eg, due to variability in diagnostic and screening efficacy), thus making bias adjustment challenging. Although we omitted these data sources, which were included in the IDF and NCD-RisC models, we were still able to incorporate data expressly gathered in 172 countries, exceeding the 144 locations with data in the IDF analysis and 146 locations with data in the NCD-RisC analysis. Moreover, our modelling approach-which used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, MR-BRT, 28,33 to develop coefficients to adjust nonreference case definitions, as well as DisMod-MR, which allows us to estimate prevalence by taking into account diabetes mortality-is unique to GBD. Other differences include our estimates for locations not reported by IDF (Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau) or NCD-RisC (Guam, Monaco, Northern Mariana Islands, San Marino, South Sudan, and Virgin Islands; appendix table S19). Our estimates covered the entire age spectrum, whereas IDF only reported total diabetes estimates for people aged 20-79 years and type 1 diabetes estimates for those younger than 19 years, and NCD-RisC reported estimates of total diabetes for individuals aged 18 years and older. Finally, we projected type-specific and total diabetes through 2050 for every age group, while IDF and NCD-RisC did not make projections as far out and did not generate forecasts for the entire population.</p>
        <p>Despite methodological and reporting differences, our estimates of particularly high total diabetes prevalence rates in the north Africa and the Middle East superregion are supported by similar estimates reported in the 2021 IDF Atlas. 4 Similar to many other regions, north Africa and the Middle East has experienced a rise in obesity due to rapid urbanisation and a concomitant rise in sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating patterns. 46,83 Our study has several strengths. The robust locationspecific, age-specific, and sex-specific diabetes estimates produced by our analysis are largely due to our ability to leverage the rigorous evidentiary and methodological framework provided by the larger GBD enterprise. GBD integrates all available data, critically examines and standardises differences in methods, and draws upon the expertise of a network comprising more than 9000 researchers located in more than 160 countries to generate estimates of mortality and morbidity associated with 370 diseases and injuries worldwide. The GBD approach entails routinely updating systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed literature and seeking input from the global collaborator network to exhaustively identify studies that meet our inclusion criteria. We regularly present our results to and solicit feedback from incountry and topic experts to address data and methodological questions and concerns. Moreover, in keeping with established GBD methods, we report estimates of YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs that provide useful details about health loss associated with diabetes, in addition to estimating disease prevalence.</p>
        <p>There are also limitations to our analysis. As discussed above, we deliberately excluded studies that identify people with diabetes by self-report status that is not validated by blood glucose tests; despite this, we were able to include data from 172 countries and territories, covering more than 80% of countries and territories reported in GBD and representing each of the 21 GBD regions. Additionally, our estimates and forecasts do not reflect a potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diabetes prevalence and burden in 2020 and 2021. At the time of this analysis, these data were not available; the figures reported here are estimates of diabetes burden during a non-pandemic period. Data on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will be integrated into our models as they become available, allowing us to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the diabetes burden between 2020 and 2023, as well as on longer time trends.</p>
        <p>Other limitations of our study include, first, that ICD coding practices documenting the underlying cause of death can vary. Studies that estimated the concordance between death certificates and patient records found disagreements with the reported underlying cause of death. These results vary by location and time but suggest that diabetes as a cause of death might be over-coded or under-coded depending on the location. [84][85][86] Second, many deaths that are coded as being caused by diabetes do not specify the diabetes type. We sought to reallocate these deaths to either type 1 or type 2 diabetes using previously available information about type-specific distribution and deaths. However, this process relied on data from highincome and high-middle-income locations that might not have been valid for dissimilar locations. Third, although clinical diagnostic criteria for diabetes require more than one abnormal glucose concentration in the absence of symptoms, 1 very few population-based epidemiological studies require these diagnostic criteria. Relying on a single glucose test could overestimate diabetes prevalence; however, the magnitude of error depends on the distribution of blood sugar concentrations as the reliability of a single glucose test increases with higher blood sugar values. 87 Fourth, approximately half the data sources included in our analysis did not contain information on the method of blood collection, which can affect reported glucose concentrations by up to 20%. [88][89][90] We plan to address this issue in upcoming GBD cycles.</p>
        <p>Fifth, our analysis did not estimate gestational diabetes explicitly since this diagnosis is captured in another GBD disease category, "Other maternal disorders", nor did our study include rarer forms of diabetes such as monogenic diabetes, 1 due to the paucity of relevant data. Sixth, GBD currently assumes that all individuals younger than 15 years have type 1 diabetes. Although there is growing evidence of type 2 diabetes occurring in younger individuals in many parts of the world, 91,92 we do not have population-based studies that distinguish type 1 diabetes from type 2 diabetes among people younger than 15 years across time, age, and location. We are monitoring the literature to determine the viability of addressing this concern. Seventh, GBD generates risk factor analyses for modifiable risk-outcome pairs. Each risk factor is identified by a review of the literature, and we regularly revisit the possibility of adding additional risk factors. The risk-outcome association is quantified through a rules-based assessment of existing evidence. Although our forecasts do not incorporate all known risk factors, here we capture the principal driver of type 2 diabetes, high BMI. In future rounds of GBD, we will revisit this strategy and consider adding additional risk factor covariates, such as low physical activity and smoking, to the model. Under the GBD's comparative risk assessment framework, we do not currently capture risk factors that have been reported in the literature for type 1 diabetes. 93,94 However, we believe that SDI is a good proxy for better access to care leading to a lower case fatality rate, and to increases in type 1 diabetes prevalence. Moreover, as with other autoimmune diseases, we found a positive correlation between economic development and the incidence of type 1 diabetes. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that additional research focused on risk factors for type 1 diabetes is needed. Finally, due to limitations inherent in the available literature and the comparative risk factor framework, we were unable to account for cohort effects apart from those pertaining to tobacco exposure.</p>
        <p>The granular location-specific, age-specific, and sexspecific epidemiological diabetes data provided in the present analysis, along with our type-specific evaluation of diabetes risk factors and projections of diabetes prevalence in 2050-including which regions and countries or territories are likely to be most affected-are essential to policy makers, who must plan for an expansion of health-service capacity to manage diabetes cases and to maximise evidence-based prevention strategies. Our estimates should also serve as a rallying call to galvanise increased research funding to identify and develop more effective measures to prevent diabetes that are economically and behaviourally sustainable at a population level across the world.</p>
        <p>Despite a well described understanding of the main drivers of diabetes, general consensus on what needs to change to reduce the diabetes burden, and widespread buy-in from international and national health organisations, diabetes prevalence continues to increase in every country and territory, age group, and in both males and females. Diabetes was already a substantial concern in 2021 and is set to become an even greater public health issue over the coming three decades, with no effective mitigation strategy currently in place. We need to urgently identify solutions that will limit population increases in risk factors for diabetes, otherwise the advance of the disease is likely to continue unabated. At the same time, we must enhance and expand access to better diabetes care to limit the complications associated with the disease. Differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes with respect to risk factor profiles and underlying pathophysiology highlight the necessity to report type-specific diabetes both separately and together, given that hyperglycaemia leads to similar complications for both types. Although type 2 diabetes can in some cases be prevented and management of hyperglycaemia has the potential to improve outcomes, the disease continues to be a major public health problem due to high rates of obesity that place an increasing burden on individuals and healthcare systems alike.</p>
