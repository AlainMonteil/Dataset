The World Health Organization's Health Promoting Schools (HPS) framework is a holistic approach to promoting health and educational attainment in school. The effectiveness of this approach has not yet been rigorously reviewed.</p>
        <p>Methods: We searched 20 health, education and social science databases, and trials registries and relevant websites in 2011 and 2013. We included cluster randomised controlled trials. Participants were children and young people aged four to 18 years attending schools/colleges. HPS interventions had to include the following three elements: input into the curriculum; changes to the school's ethos or environment; and engagement with families and/or local communities. Two reviewers identified relevant trials, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We grouped studies according to the health topic(s) targeted. Where data permitted, we performed random-effects meta-analyses.Methods: We searched 20 health, education and social science databases, and trials registries and relevant websites in 2011 and 2013.

        <p>Results: We identified 67 eligible trials tackling a range of health issues. Few studies included any academic/ attendance outcomes. We found positive average intervention effects for: body mass index (BMI), physical activity, physical fitness, fruit and vegetable intake, tobacco use, and being bullied. Intervention effects were generally small. On average across studies, we found little evidence of effectiveness for zBMI (BMI, standardized for age and gender), and no evidence for fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, mental health, violence and bullying others. It was not possible to meta-analyse data on other health outcomes due to lack of data. Methodological limitations were identified including reliance on self-reported data, lack of long-term follow-up, and high attrition rates.Results: We identified 67 eligible trials tackling a range of health issues.

        <p>Childhood and adolescence are profoundly important for public health. These years are key periods of biological and social change, laying the foundations for future adult health and economic well-being. The influence of childhood experiences on health later in life is well documented [1][2][3][4][5][6], with attitudes and behaviours acquired then 'tracking' into adulthood [7][8][9]. Establishing positive early childhood experiences in health and education has been highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO) as key to reducing global health inequities [10]. As noted by Sawyer [11:1631] in a special issue of The Lancet on adolescent health, 'many opportunities for prevention of noncommunicable diseases, mental disorders, and injuries in adults arise from a focus on risk processes that begin in or before adolescence'. Promoting health during this early period of life is key to many public health agendas [11].Childhood and adolescence are profoundly important for public health.

        <p>Given the significance of this period of the life course, schools are an important setting for health promotion, offering a comprehensive, sustained and efficient means of reaching this population. Because almost all children obtain some years of schooling, health promotion in schools can help reduce health inequities. Having a healthy, happy student body is also important for learning: healthy children achieve better educational outcomes which, in turn, are associated with improved health later in life [12].Given the significance of this period of the life course, schools are an important setting for health promotion, offering a comprehensive, sustained and efficient means of reaching this population.

        <p>This approach has proved popular and has been implemented in numerous countries worldwide in the absence of clear evidence of its effectiveness or potential harms. A systematic review [13] conducted in 1999 suggested there were 'limited but promising' data that this approach could benefit student health. However, the conclusions of the review were limited by the small number of studies available, methodological weaknesses in the trials, and inclusion of non-randomised studies.This approach has proved popular and has been implemented in numerous countries worldwide in the absence of clear evidence of its effectiveness or potential harms.

        <p>The quality of evidence was variable, both between studies and across the different domains of potential bias [14]. Poor reporting hampered our ability to assess risk of bias, particularly regarding random sequence generation, where the majority of studies were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias. Because in most studies all clusters were randomly allocated simultaneously, we deemed these at low risk of allocation concealment bias. It was difficult to blind participants to the fact they were participating in an intervention. As the majority of outcomes were measured by self-report, these were deemed to be at high risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of blinding. Where objective measures were reported (e.g. BMI), eight studies reported assessors were blind to group allocation. We assessed 34 studies as being at high risk of attrition bias. Lack of published protocols hampered our ability to assess risk of selective reporting of outcome data. Twentynine studies were rated as at high risk of other bias, largely relating to the external validity of the trials.The quality of evidence was variable, both between studies and across the different domains of potential bias [14].

        <p>On average, Physical Activity interventions were able to reduce BMI in intervention students by 0.38 kg/m 2 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.73), relative to control schools (Table 4). Although heterogeneity was large (I 2 = 86%) all three studies gave evidence in favour of the intervention. Nine studies targeted Physical Activity + Nutrition and also showed an average reduction in BMI of 0.11 kg/m 2 but with a wide confidence interval crossing the null (95% CI -0.24 to 0.02). The single nutrition intervention [22] measuring BMI did not show any impact.On average, Physical Activity interventions were able to reduce BMI in intervention students by 0.38 kg/m 2 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.73), relative to control schools (Table 4).

        <p>On average, there was evidence that Physical Activity + Nutrition interventions produced a small increase in physical activity in students relative to controls (SMD = 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.26) but again, heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 66%) (Table 4). The two Physical Activity interventions showed differing results with one favouring the intervention [33] and the other showing no effect [32]. No effect was seen for the single Nutrition-only intervention [22]. For physical fitness, there was evidence that Physical Activity + Nutrition interventions were effective at increasing fitness levels in students (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI 0.04, 0.20). The two Physical Activity interventions [31,32] also showed a positive estimated effect but with a large amount of heterogeneity (I 2 = 95%) and a wide confidence interval crossing the null (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI -0.20, 0.90).On average, there was evidence that Physical Activity + Nutrition interventions produced a small increase in physical activity in students relative to controls (SMD = 0.14, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.26) but again, heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 66%) (Table 4).

The alcohol intervention [58], which also looked at the impact on tobacco use, also showed a positive intervention effect (OR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.9).

        <p>Anti-bullying interventions showed an average reduction of 17% for reports of being bullied (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96, I 2 = 61%) relative to controls, although there was considerable heterogeneity (Table 4). For bullying others, the confidence interval for the pooled effect crossed the null (OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04, I 2 = 67%), but the two largest studies [76,77] investigating the same intervention showed strong evidence of an effect. The Emotional well-being intervention [68] failed to show impact on both being bullied or bullying others. No effect was seen for being bullied for the single Multiple Risk Behaviour intervention [63] reporting this outcome. However, another Multiple Risk Behaviour intervention [62] reported the effect of their intervention on bullying others and found evidence of a large reduction (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.71).Anti-bullying interventions showed an average reduction of 17% for reports of being bullied (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96, I 2 = 61%) relative to controls, although there was considerable heterogeneity (Table 4).

        <p>We were unable to meta-analyse results from studies for the following topics due to paucity of data: sexual health, hand-hygiene, accident prevention, eating disorders, sun safety and oral health.

        <p>Our analyses showed modest positive intervention effects on average in reducing BMI, smoking and incidence of being bullied, and increasing physical activity, fitness, and fruit and vegetable intake. We found little or no evidence of effect for HPS interventions assessing zBMI, fat intake, alcohol use, drug use, violence, depression or bullying others. Paucity of data meant we were unable to meta-analyse data for outcomes relating to sexual health, hand-washing, oral health, accident prevention or eating disorders.Our analyses showed modest positive intervention effects on average in reducing BMI, smoking and incidence of being bullied, and increasing physical activity, fitness, and fruit and vegetable intake.

        <p>HPS interventions focusing on physical activity alone found an average reduction in BMI of 0.38 kg/m 2 but no effect was found for Physical Activity + Nutrition interventions. We found little evidence of effect for zBMI, other than in the single Physical Activity intervention [31]. Physical Activity + Nutrition interventions were, on average, able to produce increases in physical activity and fitness, equivalent to an additional three minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity per day and a 0.25 level increase in the shuttle run fitness test. Those interventions focused solely on nutrition increased fruit and vegetable intake by an average of 30 g/day or roughly half a portion. These effect sizes are small but are comparable to findings from other school based interventions [86][87][88]. Small effects scaled up to population level can produce public health benefits [89], although at present these potential gains appear modest. Stronger evidence is available for HPS effects on smoking and bullying. Students receiving HPS interventions were, on average, 23% less likely to smoke and 17% less likely to be bullied.HPS interventions focusing on physical activity alone found an average reduction in BMI of 0.38 kg/m 2 but no effect was found for Physical Activity + Nutrition interventions.

        <p>We found little or no evidence of effect for alcohol use, drug use, violence, depression and bullying others but this should not be confused with 'evidence of no effect'. For the majority of outcomes, data were available from few studies. Although the confidence intervals for the pooled effect cross the null, for all but one outcome (depression), summary estimates from meta-analyses consistently favour the HPS intervention. Thus, while we cannot at this stage conclude that the HPS approach is effective for these outcomes, there is sufficient evidence of promise to warrant further trials in these areas. Indeed, interventions focusing specifically on school environments have shown promising effects in reducing alcohol use and violence in students [90]. That some individual trials showed evidence of effect for several of these outcomes also suggests the need for exploration into which intervention components might be effective.We found little or no evidence of effect for alcohol use, drug use, violence, depression and bullying others but this should not be confused with 'evidence of no effect'.

        <p>The use of cluster RCTs to evaluate complex interventions such as the HPS framework is much debated. Some have argued that RCTs are an inappropriate method to evaluate complex public health programmes, based on an assumption that RCTs require highly standardised intervention components and methods of delivery that preclude the possibility of local adaptation [91,92]. This assumption is unfounded [93,94]. Well-designed cluster RCTS can capture complexity and allow for local adaptation; the critical issue is 'what' is standardised (the intervention components or the steps in the change process) [94]. This review of 67 cluster RCTs represents an important contribution to the body of evidence on the effectiveness of the HPS approach. Focusing on the most robust evidence available and using a conservative approach to assess effectiveness, we have found evidence in favour of the HPS framework for a number of important outcomes. To contextualise these findings, it is important this review be read alongside other evaluations of the HPS framework employing different evaluation study designs [95,96] which offer insight into the process and practicalities of implementation.The use of cluster RCTs to evaluate complex interventions such as the HPS framework is much debated.

        <p>Our meta-analyses provide the best summary to-date of the likely average effect of HPS interventions. However this review presented methodological challenges. Unlike clinical trials which often involve standardised interventions, homogenous populations and well-established outcome measures, public health interventions display more heterogeneity, particularly in the case of non-prescriptive interventions such as the HPS framework that allows considerable flexibility in intervention components.Our meta-analyses provide the best summary to-date of the likely average effect of HPS interventions.

        <p>Our meta-analyses have limitations. First, where standard deviations (SD) for study populations were not reported, we imputed a SD from another similar study to calculate a standardised mean difference (SMD). Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of this decision on our analyses [14]. Second, to calculate SMDs we used the overall ('total') SD across all individuals in a study rather than the 'within-cluster' SD, as studies rarely reported the latter. However, because ICCs were found to be small, this is unlikely to have substantially affected our results. Finally, in a minority of studies we used ICCs from similar studies to adjust for clustering, conservatively choosing the largest available ICC.Our meta-analyses have limitations.

        <p>A further limitation of the review is that we are unable to compare the effectiveness of the HPS approach to simpler, less holistic interventions because most studies compared HPS interventions against no intervention or the school's usual practice. While HPS effect sizes are broadly similar to results from other school-based systematic reviews [86][87][88]97,98], the latter often include different types of interventions ranging from 'curriculum only' interventions to more comprehensive programmes making meaningful comparisons difficult. Future studies should consider use of factorial designs to identify the relative importance of the three HPS domains and the way in which they interact.A further limitation of the review is that we are unable to compare the effectiveness of the HPS approach to simpler, less holistic interventions because most studies compared HPS interventions against no intervention or the school's usual practice.

        <p>Whilst our review has found evidence in favour of the HPS approach for a number of outcomes, it has also identified gaps in our knowledge base. We lack sufficient data at present to determine the effect of this approach for a number of health outcomes, particularly mental health and sexual health. We also identified an imbalance between which health topics were focused on at different ages. Physical activity and/or nutrition interventions tended to focus on younger children (&lt;12 years) while substance use, violence, sexual health and mental health interventions usually targeted older students (12-14 yearolds). This imbalance is unjustified. Obesity does not just affect younger children [99]; we need to develop effective obesity-prevention interventions for older children too. Equally, two of the most effective Multiple Risk Behaviour interventions [59,62] focusing on substance use and violence were conducted in elementary-school children, suggesting that intervening early may help prevent risk-taking in teenage years. We also identified the family/community domain to be the weakest aspect of the implementation of the HPS framework with most studies employing very minimal efforts to engage families (e.g. newsletter articles or flyers).Whilst our review has found evidence in favour of the HPS approach for a number of outcomes, it has also identified gaps in our knowledge base.

        <p>The majority of studies did not provide data on longterm follow-up or economic costs so the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of this approach is largely unknown. Studies were also often underpowered and relied heavily on self-reported data. It is disappointing to note that many of these methodological issues were identified in a previous review of the HPS framework and little improvement has been made in the past fifteen years [13]. Additionally, the current evidence base is predominantly based on studies from high-income contexts, mostly from North America. Only eight studies were conducted outside of high-income countries, and only one took place within a low-income country [67].The majority of studies did not provide data on longterm follow-up or economic costs so the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of this approach is largely unknown.

        <p>The lack of evidence from poorer parts of the world is worrying. Given the well-established links between poor nutrition and infectious disease on children's cognitive development [100,101], the HPS framework should have much to offer in such contexts. Conversely, the tripling of obesity levels in just twenty years in low-and middle-income countries [102] demands cross-sectoral action, which the HPS framework might help address. Also, aggressive marketing of tobacco in the developing world has led to an increase in smoking, and any substantial increase in adolescent smoking in these contexts will have devastating consequences for future adult health [11:1636]. There are over three billion 0-24 year-olds alive today, almost 90% of whom live in low-and middle-income countries [103]. Investing in child and adolescent health in such contexts is crucial for improving population health and, consequently, national economic development.The lack of evidence from poorer parts of the world is worrying.

        <p>Finally, our review highlights the lack of evidence regarding the educational impact of the HPS framework. Only four studies measured academic attainment or student attendance. This is disappointing for two reasons. First, it suggests researchers may have failed to grasp that improving educational outcomes is, in itself, a public health priority. Second, interventions are more likely to be successful and scaled up if educationalists are convinced it will contribute to the core mission of schools: to educate students. The WHO recently highlighted the lack of attention paid to the impact of child health on educational outcomes in high-income countries [12]. Future HPS evaluations should seek to address this gap.Finally, our review highlights the lack of evidence regarding the educational impact of the HPS framework.

        <p>Child and adolescent health matter. Investment in these formative years can prevent suffering, reduce inequity, create healthy and productive adults and deliver social and economic dividends to nations. Schools are an obvious place to facilitate this investment given the inextricable links between health and education [104].
