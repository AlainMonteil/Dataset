        <p>The methods and results of systematic reviews should be reported in sufficient detail to allow users to assess the trustworthiness and applicability of the review findings. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was developed to facilitate transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews and has been updated (to PRISMA 2020) to reflect recent advances in systematic review methodology and terminology. Here, we present the explanation and elaboration paper for PRISMA 2020, where we explain why reporting of each item is recommended, present bullet points that detail the reporting recommendations, and present examples from published reviews. We hope that changes to the content and structure of PRISMA 2020 will facilitate uptake of the guideline and lead to more transparent, complete, and accurate reporting of systematic reviews.The methods and results of systematic reviews should be reported in sufficient detail to allow users to assess the trustworthiness and applicability of the review findings.

        <p>Systematic reviews are essential for healthcare providers, policy makers, and other decision makers, who would otherwise be confronted by an overwhelming volume of research on which to base their decisions. To allow decision makers to assess the trustworthiness and applicability of review findings, reports of systematic reviews should be transparent and complete. Furthermore, such reporting should allow others to replicate or update reviews. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement published in 2009 (hereafter referred to as PRISMA 2009) [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] was designed to help authors prepare transparent accounts of their reviews, and its recommendations have been widely endorsed and adopted. 13 We have updated the PRISMA 2009 statement (to PRISMA 2020) to ensure currency and relevance and to reflect advances in systematic review methodology and terminology.Systematic reviews are essential for healthcare providers, policy makers, and other decision makers, who would otherwise be confronted by an overwhelming volume of research on which to base their decisions.

        <p>The PRISMA 2020 statement has been designed primarily for systematic reviews of studies that evaluate the effects of health interventions, irrespective of the design of the included studies. However, the checklist items are applicable to reports of systematic reviews evaluating other non-health-related interventions (for example, social or educational interventions), and many items are applicable to systematic reviews with objectives other than evaluating interventions (such as evaluating aetiology, prevalence, or prognosis). PRISMA 2020 is intended for use in systematic reviews that include synthesis (such as pairwise metaanalysis or other statistical synthesis methods) or do not include synthesis (for example, because only one eligible study is identified). The PRISMA 2020 items are relevant for mixed-methods systematic reviews (which include quantitative and qualitative studies), but reporting guidelines addressing the presentation and synthesis of qualitative data should also be consulted. 14 15 PRISMA 2020 can be used for original systematic reviews, updated systematic reviews, or continually updated ("living") systematic reviews. However, for updated and living systematic reviews, there may be some additional considerations that need to be addressed. Extensions to the PRISMA 2009 statement have been developed to guide reporting of network meta-analyses, 16 meta-analyses of individual participant data, 17 systematic reviews of harms, 18 systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, 19 and scoping reviews 20 ; for these types of reviews we recommend authors report their review PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration PRISMA 2020 is published as a suite of three papers: a statement paper (consisting of the 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagram 23 ); a development paper (which outlines the steps taken to update the PRISMA 2009 statement and provides rationale for modifications to the original items 24 ); and this paper, the updated explanation and elaboration for PRISMA 2020. In this paper, for each item, we explain why reporting of the item is recommended and present bullet points that detail the reporting recommendations. This structure is new to PRISMA 2020 and has been adopted to facilitate implementation of the guidance. 25 26 Authors familiar with PRISMA 2020 may opt to use the standalone statement paper 23 ; however, for those who are new to or unfamiliar with PRISMA 2020, we encourage use of this explanation and elaboration document.

        <p>We use standardised language in the explanation and elaboration to indicate whether the reporting recommendations for each item (which we refer to as "elements" throughout) are essential or additional. Essential elements should be reported in the main report or as supplementary material for all systematic reviews (except for those preceded by "If…," which should only be reported where applicable). These have been selected as essential because we consider their reporting important for users to assess the trustworthiness and applicability of a review's findings, or their reporting would aid in reproducing the findings. Additional elements are those which are not essential but provide supplementary information that may enhance the completeness and usability of systematic review reports. The essential and additional elements are framed in terms of reporting the "presence" of a method or result (such as reporting if individuals were contacted to identify studies) rather than reporting on their absence. In some instances, however, reporting the absence of a method may be helpful (for example, "We did not contact individuals to identify studies"). We leave these decisions to the judgment of authors. Finally, although PRISMA 2020 provides a template for where information might be located, the suggested location should not be seen as prescriptive; the guiding principle is to ensure the information is reported.We use standardised language in the explanation and elaboration to indicate whether the reporting recommendations for each item (which we refer to as "elements" throughout) are essential or additional.

        <p>Journals and publishers might impose word and section limits, and limits on the number of tables and figures allowed in the main report. In such cases, if the relevant information for some items already appears in a publicly accessible review protocol, referring to the protocol may suffice. Alternatively, placing detailed descriptions of the methods used or additional results (such as for less critical outcomes) in supplementary files is recommended. Ideally, supplementary files should be deposited to a general-purpose or institutional open-access repository that provides free and permanent access to the material (such as Open Science Framework, Dryad, figshare). A reference or link to the additional information should be included in the main report.Journals and publishers might impose word and section limits, and limits on the number of tables and figures allowed in the main report.

        <p>Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019. All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions for CMDs in LMICs which measured intimate partner violence were included, without language or date restrictions. We approached study authors to obtain unpublished aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as differences between standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, comparing women who did and who did not report intimate partner violence via random-effects meta-analyses.Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, CINAHL, LILACS, ScieELO, Cochrane, PubMed databases, trials registries, 3ie, Google Scholar, and forward and backward citations for studies published between database inception and Aug 16, 2019.

We approached study authors to obtain unpublished aggregate subgroup data for women who did and did not report intimate partner violence. We did separate random-effects meta-analyses for anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and psychological distress outcomes.

        <p>• Assessment of each record by one reviewer-Single screening is an efficient use of time and resources, but there is a higher risk of missing relevant studies [49][50][51] • Assessment of records by more than one reviewer-Double screening can vary from duplicate checking of all records (by two or more reviewers independently) to a second reviewer checking a sample only (for example, a random sample of screened records, or all excluded records). This approach may be more reliable than single screening but at the expense of increased reviewer time, given the time needed to resolve discrepancies [49][50][51] • Priority screening to focus early screening effort on most relevant records-Instead of screening records in year, title, author or random order, machine learning is used to identify relevant studies earlier in the screening process than would otherwise be the case. Priority screening is an iterative process in which the machine continually reassesses unscreened records for relevance. This approach can increase review efficiency by enabling the review team to start on subsequent steps of the review while less relevant records are still being screened. Both single and multiple reviewer assessments can be combined with priority screening 52 53 • Priority screening with the automatic elimination of less relevant records-Once the most relevant records have been identified using priority screening, teams may choose to stop screening based on the assumption that the remaining records are unlikely to be relevant. However, there is a risk of erroneously excluding relevant studies because of uncertainty about when it is safe to stop screening; the balance between efficiency gains and risk tolerance will be review-specific 52 53 • Machine learning classifiers-Machine learning classifiers are statistical models that use training data to rank records according to their relevance.• Assessment of each record by one reviewer-Single screening is an efficient use of time and resources, but there is a higher risk of missing relevant studies [49][50][51] • Assessment of records by more than one reviewer-Double screening can vary from duplicate checking of all records (by two or more reviewers independently) to a second reviewer checking a sample only (for example, a random sample of screened records, or all excluded records).

        <p>They can be calibrated to achieve a given level of recall, thus enabling reviewers to implement screening rules, such as eliminating records or replacing double with single screening. Because the performance of classifiers is highly dependent on the data used to build them, classifiers should only be used to classify records for which they are designed 53 54 • Previous "known" assessments-Screening decisions for records that have already been manually checked can be reused to exclude the same records from being reassessed, provided the eligibility criteria are the same. For example, groups that maintain registers of controlled trials to facilitate systematic reviews can avoid continually rescreening the same records by matching and then including/excluding those records from further consideration. • Crowdsourcing-Crowdsourcing involves recruiting (usually via the internet) a large group of individuals to contribute to a task or project, such as screening records. If crowdsourcing is integrated with other study selection approaches, the specific platforms used should have well established and documented agreement algorithms, and data on crowd accuracy and reliability 55 56 Example of item 8 of PRISMA 2020 checklist "Three researchers (AP, HB-R, FG) independently reviewed titles and abstracts of the first 100 records and discussed inconsistencies until consensus was obtained. Then, in pairs, the researchers independently screened titles and abstracts of all articles retrieved.

Multiple results compatible with an outcome domain in a study might also arise when study investigators report results based on multiple analysis populations (such as all participants randomised, all participants receiving a specific amount of treatment), methods for handling missing data (such as multiple imputation, last-observation-carried-forward), or methods for handling confounding (such as adjustment for different covariates). 6769 Reviewers might seek all results that were compatible with each outcome definition from each study or use a process to select a subset of the results. 65 69 Examples of processes to select results include selecting the outcome definition that (a) was most common across studies, (b) the review authors considered "best" according to a prespecified hierarchy (for example, which prioritises measures included in a core outcome measurement set), or (c) the study investigators considered most important (such as the study's primary outcome).

Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and, if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process Explanation: Users of reviews need to know the risk of bias in the included studies to appropriately interpret the evidence. Numerous tools have been developed to assess study limitations for various designs. 76 However, many tools have been criticised because of their content (which may extend beyond assessing study limitations that have the potential to bias findings) and the way in which the items are combined (such as scales where items are combined to yield a numerical score) (see box 4). 72 Reporting details of the selected tool enables readers to assess whether the tool focuses solely on items that have the potential to bias findings. Reporting details of how studies were assessed (such as by one or two authors) allows readers to assess the potential for errors in the assessments. 58 Reporting how risk of bias assessments were incorporated into the analysis is addressed in Items #13e and #13f. Where multiple cognition outcomes were reported, we selected one outcome for inclusion in analyses and for reporting the main outcomes (e.g. for GRADEing), choosing the result that provided the most complete information for analysis. Where multiple results remained, we listed all available outcomes (without results) and asked our content expert to independently rank these based on relevance to the review question, and the validity and reliability of the measures used.

Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and, if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process Explanation: Users of reviews need to know the risk of bias in the included studies to appropriately interpret the evidence. Numerous tools have been developed to assess study limitations for various designs. 76 However, many tools have been criticised because of their content (which may extend beyond assessing study limitations that have the potential to bias findings) and the way in which the items are combined (such as scales where items are combined to yield a numerical score) (see box 4). 72 Reporting details of the selected tool enables readers to assess whether the tool focuses solely on items that have the potential to bias findings. Reporting details of how studies were assessed (such as by one or two authors) allows readers to assess the potential for errors in the assessments. 58 Reporting how risk of bias assessments were incorporated into the analysis is addressed in Items #13e and #13f. Where multiple cognition outcomes were reported, we selected one outcome for inclusion in analyses and for reporting the main outcomes (e.g. for GRADEing), choosing the result that provided the most complete information for analysis. Where multiple results remained, we listed all available outcomes (without results) and asked our content expert to independently rank these based on relevance to the review question, and the validity and reliability of the measures used.

        <p>Item 12. Specify for each outcome the effect measure(s) (such as risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of results Explanation: To interpret a synthesised or study result, users need to know what effect measure was used. Effect measures refer to statistical constructs that compare outcome data between two groups. For instance, a risk ratio is an example of an effect measure that might be used for dichotomous outcomes. 89 The chosen effect measure has implications for interpretation of the findings and might affect the meta-analysis results (such as heterogeneity 90 ). Authors might use one effect measure to synthesise results and then re-express the synthesised results using another effect measure. For example, for metaanalyses of standardised mean differences, authors might re-express the combined results in units of a well known measurement scale, and for meta-analyses of risk ratios or odds ratios, authors might re-express results in absolute terms (such as risk difference). 91 Furthermore, authors need to interpret effect estimates in relation to whether the effect is of importance to decision makers. For a particular outcome and effect measure, this requires specification of thresholds (or ranges) used to interpret the size of effect (such as Example of item 10b of PRISMA 2020 checklist "We collected data on: • the report: author, year, and source of publication; • the study: sample characteristics, social demography, and definition and criteria used for depression; • the participants: stroke sequence (first ever vs recurrent), social situation, time elapsed since stroke onset, history of psychiatric illness, current neurological status, current treatment for depression, and history of coronary artery disease; • the research design and features: sampling mechanism, treatment assignment mechanism, adherence, non-response, and length of follow up; • the intervention: type, duration, dose, timing, and mode of delivery." 177 Box 4: Assessment of risk of bias in studies and bias due to missing resultsItem 12.

        <p>The terms "quality assessment" and "critical appraisal" are often used to describe the process of evaluating the methodological conduct or reporting of studies. 76 In PRISMA 2020, we distinguish "quality" from "risk of bias" and have focused the relevant items and elaborations on the latter. Risk of bias refers to the potential for study findings to systematically deviate from the truth due to methodological flaws in the design, conduct or analysis. 72 Quality is not well defined, but has been shown to encompass constructs beyond those that may bias the findings, including, for example, imprecision, reporting completeness, ethics, and applicability. [77][78][79] In systematic reviews, focus should be given to the design, conduct, and analysis features that may lead to important bias in the findings.The terms "quality assessment" and "critical appraisal" are often used to describe the process of evaluating the methodological conduct or reporting of studies. 76 In PRISMA 2020, we distinguish "quality" from "risk of bias" and have focused the relevant items and elaborations on the latter.

        <p>In PRISMA 2020, two aspects of risk of bias are considered. The first aspect is risk of bias in the results of the individual studies included in a systematic review. Empirical evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that several features of study design are associated with larger intervention effect estimates in studies; these features include inadequate generation and concealment of a random sequence to assign participants to groups, substantial loss to follow-up of participants, and unblinded outcome assessment. 80 The second aspect is risk of bias in the result of a synthesis (such as meta-analysis) due to missing studies or results within studies. Missing studies/ results may introduce bias when the decision to publish a study/result is influenced by the observed P value or magnitude or direction of the effect. 81 For example, studies with statistically non-significant results may not have been submitted for publication (publication bias), or particular results that were statistically non-significant may have been omitted from study reports (selective non-reporting bias). 82 83 Tools for assessing risk of bias Many tools have been developed to assess the risk of bias in studies 76 78 79 or bias due to missing results. 84 Existing tools typically take the form of composite scales and domain-based tools. 78 85 Composite scales include multiple items which each have a numeric score attached, from which an overall summary score might be calculated. Domain-based tools require users to judge risk of bias within specific domains, and to record the information on which each judgment was based. 72 86 87 Specifying the components/domains in the tool used in the review can help readers determine whether the tool focuses on risk of bias only or addresses other "quality" constructs. Presenting assessments for each component/ domain in the tool is preferable to reporting a single "quality score" because it enables users to understand the specific components/domains that are at risk of bias in each study.In PRISMA 2020, two aspects of risk of bias are considered.

        <p>Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to synthesise results when study effect estimates and their variances are available, yielding a quantitative summary of results. 103 The method facilitates interpretation that would otherwise be difficult to achieve if, for example, a narrative summary of each result was presented, particularly as the number of studies increases. Furthermore, meta-analysis increases the chance of detecting a clinically important effect as statistically significant, if it exists, and increases the precision of the estimated effect. 104Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to synthesise results when study effect estimates and their variances are available, yielding a quantitative summary of results. 103 The method facilitates interpretation that would otherwise be difficult to achieve if, for example, a narrative summary of each result was presented, particularly as the number of studies increases.

        <p>The summary estimate is a weighted average of the study effect estimates, where the study weights are determined primarily by the meta-analysis model. The two most common meta-analysis models are the "fixed-effect" and "random-effects" models. 103 The assumption underlying the fixed-effect model is that there is one true (common) intervention effect and that the observed differences in results across studies reflect random variation only. This model is sometimes referred to as the "common-effects" or "equal-effects" model. 103 A fixed-effect model can also be interpreted under a different assumption, that the true intervention effects are different and unrelated. This model is referred to as the "fixed-effects" model. 105 The random-effects model assumes that there is not one true intervention effect but, rather, a distribution of true intervention effects and that the observed differences in results across studies reflect real differences in the effects of an intervention. 104 The random-effects and fixed-effects models are similar in that they assume the true intervention effects are different, but they differ in that the random-effects model assumes the effects are related through a distribution, whereas the fixed-effects model does not make this assumption.The summary estimate is a weighted average of the study effect estimates, where the study weights are determined primarily by the meta-analysis model.

        <p>Many considerations may influence an author's choice of meta-analysis model. For example, their choice may be based on the clinical and methodological diversity of the included studies and the expectation that the underlying intervention effects will differ (potentially leading to selection of a random-effects model) or concern about small-study effects (the tendency for smaller studies to show different effects to larger ones, 106 potentially leading to fitting of both a random-effects and fixed-effect model). Sometimes authors select a model based on the heterogeneity statistics observed (for example, switch from a fixed-effect to a random-effects model if the I 2 statistic was &gt;50%). 107 However, this practice is strongly discouraged.Many considerations may influence an author's choice of meta-analysis model.

        <p>Sensitivity analyses differ from subgroup analyses. Sensitivity analyses consist of making informal comparisons between different ways of estimating the same effect, whereas subgroup analyses consist of formally undertaking a statistical comparison across the subgroups. 103 Extensions to meta-analysis that model or account for dependency In most meta-analyses, effect estimates from independent studies are combined. Standard meta-analysis methods are appropriate for this situation, since an underlying assumption is that the effect estimates are independent. However, standard meta-analysis methods are not appropriate when the effect estimates are correlated. Correlated effect estimates arise when multiple effect estimates from a single study are calculated using some or all of the same participants and are included in the same meta-analysis. For example, where multiple effect estimates from a multi-arm trial are included in the same meta-analysis, or effect estimates for multiple outcomes from the same study are included. For this situation, a range of methods are available that appropriately model or account for the dependency of the effect estimates. These methods include multivariate metaanalysis, 110 multilevel models, 111 or robust variance estimation. 112Sensitivity analyses differ from subgroup analyses.

        <p>Explanation: If authors performed sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of the synthesised results to decisions made during the review process (see box 5), they should provide sufficient details so that readers are able to assess the appropriateness of the analyses and could reproduce the reported results (with access to the data). Ideally, sensitivity analyses should be pre-specified in the protocol, but unexpected issues may emerge during the review process that necessitate their use. The validity of a synthesis may be threatened when the available results differ systematically from the missing results. This is known as "bias due to missing results" and arises from "reporting biases" such as selective non-publication and selective non-reporting of results (see box 4). 81 Direct methods for assessing the risk of bias due to missing results include comparing outcomes and analyses pre-specified in study registers, protocols, and statistical analysis plans with results that were available in study reports. Statistical and graphical methods exist to assess whether the observed data suggest potential for missing results (such as contour enhanced funnel plots, Egger's test) and how robust the synthesis is to different assumptions about the nature of potentially missing results (such as selection models). 84 122-124 Tools (such as checklists, scales, or domain-based tools) that prompt users to consider some or all of these approaches are available. 81 84 Therefore, reporting methods (tools, graphical, statistical, or other) used to assess risk of bias due to missing results is recommended so that readers are able to assess how appropriate the methods were. The process by which assessments were conducted should also be reported to enable readers to assess the potential for errors and facilitate replicability.Explanation: If authors performed sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of the synthesised results to decisions made during the review process (see box 5), they should provide sufficient details so that readers are able to assess the appropriateness of the analyses and could reproduce the reported results (with access to the data).

        <p>Example 1: meta-analysis "As the effects of functional appliance treatment were deemed to be highly variable according to patient age, sex, individual maturation of the maxillofacial structures, and appliance characteristics, a random-effects model was chosen to calculate the average distribution of treatment effects that can be expected. A restricted maximum likelihood random-effects variance estimator was used instead of the older DerSimonian-Laird one, following recent guidance. Random-effects 95% prediction intervals were to be calculated for meta-analyses with at least three studies to aid in their interpretation by quantifying expected treatment effects in a future clinical setting. The extent and impact of between-study heterogeneity were assessed by inspecting the forest plots and by calculating the tau-squared and the I-squared statistics, respectively. The 95% CIs (uncertainty intervals) around tau-squared and the I-squared were calculated to judge our confidence about these metrics. We arbitrarily adopted the I-squared thresholds of &gt;75% to be considered as signs of considerable heterogeneity, but we also judged the evidence for this heterogeneity (through the uncertainty intervals) and the localization on the forest plot…All analyses were run in

In order to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects associated with reminders without resorting to numerous assumptions or conveying a misleading degree of confidence in the results, we used the median improvement in dichotomous process adherence measures across studies…With each study represented by a single median outcome, we calculated the median effect size and interquartile range across all included studies for that comparison." 184 Example of item 13e of PRISMA 2020 checklist "Given a sufficient number of trials, we used unadjusted and adjusted mixed-effects meta-regression analyses to assess whether variation among studies in smoking cessation effect size was moderated by tailoring of the intervention for disadvantaged groups. The resulting regression coefficient indicates how the outcome variable (log risk ratio (RR) for smoking cessation) changes when interventions take a socioeconomic-position-tailored versus non-socioeconomic-tailored approach. A statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) coefficient indicates that there is a linear association between the effect estimate for smoking cessation and the explanatory variable.

These covariates were included a priori as potential confounders given that programmes tailored to socioeconomic position might include more intervention sessions or components or be delivered by different professionals with varying experience.

        <p>Item 20a. For each synthesis, briefly summarise the characteristics and risk of bias among contributing studies Explanation: Many systematic review reports include narrative summaries of the characteristics and risk of bias across all included studies. 36 However, such general summaries are not useful when the studies contributing to each synthesis vary, and particularly when there are many studies. For example, one metaanalysis might include three studies of participants aged 30 years on average, whereas another metaanalysis might include 10 studies of participants aged 60 years on average; in this case, knowing the mean age per synthesis is more meaningful than the overall mean age across all 13 studies. Providing a brief summary of the characteristics and risk of bias among studies contributing to each synthesis (metaanalysis or other) should help readers understand the applicability and risk of bias in the synthesised result. Furthermore, a summary at the level of the synthesis is more usable since it obviates the need for readers to refer to multiple sections of the review in order to interpret results. 92 Essential elements Item 20b.

Reviews not meeting the criteria for inclusion in PROSPERO could be registered elsewhere; for example, in the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository. Both PROSPERO and OSF allow for registration without cost.</p>
        <p>A review protocol is distinct from a register entry for a review. A review protocol outlines in detail the pre-planned objectives and methods intended to be used to conduct the review, helping to anticipate/avoid potential problems before embarking on a review and providing a methodical approach to prevent arbitrary decision making during the review process. 22 Systematic reviewers are encouraged to report their protocols in accordance with the PRISMA guidance for protocols (PRISMA-P). 21 PRISMA-P consists of a checklist 21 accompanied by a detailed guidance document providing researchers with a step-by-step approach for documenting a systematic review protocol. 22 A review protocol should be a public document in order to facilitate future purposeful replications or updates of the review and to help future users evaluate whether selective reporting and potential bias were present in the review process. 22 Review protocols can be made public through one of several routes. One option is to upload a PDF of the protocol to the corresponding PROSPERO registration record so they are linked in perpetuity. Another option is to make a protocol a document with its own unique identifier (that is, a DOI) so it can be cited across various documents including the PROSPERO registration record and in the full text of the completed review. To achieve this, reviewers may opt to publish a protocol in a journal that is open access or provides free access to content (such as Systematic Reviews, BMJ Open) or a journal using the Registered Reports publishing framework (https://cos.io/rr/), where it will benefit from external feedback before publication, or deposit a protocol in a general purpose or institutional open access repository (such as Open Science Framework Registries, Zenodo).A review protocol is distinct from a register entry for a review.

        <p>Item 25. Describe sources of financial or nonfinancial support for the review, and the role of the funders or sponsors in the review Explanation: As with any research report, authors should be transparent about the sources of support received to conduct the review. For example, funders may provide salary to researchers to undertake the review, the services of an information specialist to conduct searches, or access to commercial databases that would otherwise not have been available. Authors may have also obtained support from a translation service to translate articles or in-kind use of software to manage or analyse the study data. In some reviews, the funder or sponsor (that is, the individual or organisation assuming responsibility for the initiation and management of the review) may have contributed to defining the review question, determining eligibility of studies, collecting data, analysing data, interpreting results, or approving the final review report. There is potential for bias in the review findings arising from such involvement, particularly when the funder or sponsor has an interest in obtaining a particular result. 157 Essential elementsItem 25.
