        <p>Background Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threatening modern health care. However, estimating their incidence, complications, and attributable mortality is challenging. We aimed to estimate the burden of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health concern in countries of the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015, measured in number of cases, attributable deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).Background Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threatening modern health care.

        <p>We estimated the incidence of infections with 16 antibiotic resistance-bacterium combinations from European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2015 data that was country-corrected for population coverage. We multiplied the number of bloodstream infections (BSIs) by a conversion factor derived from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections in European acute care hospitals in 2011-12 to estimate the number of non-BSIs. We developed disease outcome models for five types of infection on the basis of systematic reviews of the literature.We estimated the incidence of infections with 16 antibiotic resistance-bacterium combinations from European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) 2015 data that was country-corrected for population coverage.

        <p>Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a threat to modern health care and have triggered the development of coordinated and comprehensive national, European, and global actions plans. 1,2 As outlined in these action plans, monitoring and evaluating interventions requires robust information on the incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their effect on the health of populations; however, such information is scarce. 3 This information would also be useful to set priorities, across and within countries, and model future scenarios. 4 Data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) are relevant when monitoring trends in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA), but do not give the full epidemiological picture, in particular for monitoring the effect of the European action plan.Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a threat to modern health care and have triggered the development of coordinated and comprehensive national, European, and global actions plans. 1,2 As outlined in these action plans, monitoring and evaluating interventions requires robust information on the incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their effect on the health of populations; however, such information is scarce. 3 This information would also be useful to set priorities, across and within countries, and model future scenarios. 4 Data from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) are relevant when monitoring trends in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA), but do not give the full epidemiological picture, in particular for monitoring the effect of the European action plan.</p>
        <p>There are several challenges when estimating the burden of disease associated with infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. For example, sampling and micro biological procedures for testing of the isolates, data collection processes, and the structures of surveillance systems might vary between and within countries. Furthermore, knowledge of the clinical and public health consequences of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans is still scarce. In particular, scientific debate is ongoing on the appropriate epidemiological study design and statistical inference methods to measure reliable estimates of untoward clinical outcomes attri butable to infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 3,4 Previous studies estimating the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria were restricted by the number of included bacteria or type of infections. 5 In this study, we aimed to estimate the burden of infections due to selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health importance in the EU and EEA in 2015, based on a country-specific evaluation of available surveillance data and on scientific evidence on attributable clinical outcomes (deaths, length of stay, risk of developing sequelae and their duration, attributable to the infections [yes or no]). We measured burden as the number of cases of all types of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the number of deaths attributable to these infections and, for the first time, the resulting number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).There are several challenges when estimating the burden of disease associated with infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

        <p>The study focused on the eight bacterial species frequently isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (invasive isolates) in the EU and EEA in 2015 and reported to the EARS-Net. Other criteria considered were inclusion in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial use (2011-12) and inclusion in the list of EU antibiotic resistance policy indicators in the ECDC, European Food Safety Authority, and European Medicines Agency Joint Scientific Opinion, and consideration of emerging threats (eg, colistin resistance). 6 The included antibiotic resistance-bacterium combinations were colistinresistant, carbapenem-resistant, or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter spp; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant, or third-generation cephalosporinresistant Escherichia coli; colistin-resistant, carbapenemresistant, or third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae; colistin-resistant, carbapenemresistant, or multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and penicillin-resistant and macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Full details are provided in the appendix (p 197). We included all five types of infection: bloodstream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, surgical site infections, and other infections.The study focused on the eight bacterial species frequently isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (invasive isolates) in the EU and EEA in 2015 and reported to the EARS-Net.

        <p>Evidence before this study Estimates of the incidence, attributable mortality, attributable length of stay, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of all infection types with antibiotic-resistant bacteria are scarce. We searched PubMed for articles published between inception and Aug 1, 2018, using the terms "burden" and "antimicrobial resistance", with no language restrictions. We found 25 relevant peer-reviewed publications. Previous studies estimating the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria were either restricted in their geographical scope, number of infections, or types of infections. Reports were published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in 2009, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2013, and the UK Review on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2014, but these were not peer-reviewed. Challenges when estimating the incidence of diseases include poor availability of data, heterogeneous sampling and microbiological procedures for testing of the isolates, data collection processes, and differences on how surveillance systems are structured. Moreover, quantifying the risk of death or other clinical outcomes following an infection with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which generally occurs in patients affected by other diseases, is challenging and its attribution is debateable. To our knowledge, data on the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed by a composite health measure to compare with the effect of other diseases, have not been published to date.Evidence before this study Estimates of the incidence, attributable mortality, attributable length of stay, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of all infection types with antibiotic-resistant bacteria are scarce.

        <p>EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries report data to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) on bloodstream infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a coherent and standardised manner. On the basis of EARS-Net data, we developed a step-wise approach, involving other data sources (such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control point prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial use in European acute care hospitals in 2011-12), to determine the country-specific incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria of public health importance in 2015. We did systematic reviews of the literature, including a standardised approach to the selection and extraction of the evidence, to inform the attributable mortality and attributable length of stay of each antibiotic resistance-bacterium combination. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations on 2400 disease models provided estimates of DALYs, which could be placed within the general context of the burden of other diseases.EU and European Economic Area (EEA) countries report data to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) on bloodstream infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a coherent and standardised manner.

        <p>The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA was similar to the cumulative burden of influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV, was notably diverse across countries, and has increased between 2007 and 2015. Strategies to prevent and control antibiotic-resistant bacteria require coordination at EU and EEA and global levels, and interventions that are tailored to national and local challenges. Our finding that most of the estimated burden was in hospitals and other health-care settings suggests the urgent need to address antimicrobial resistance as a patient safety issue and the need for alternative treatment options for patients with such infections who have comorbidities or are otherwise vulnerable (eg, because of their poor immune system or age).The estimated burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA was similar to the cumulative burden of influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV, was notably diverse across countries, and has increased between 2007 and 2015.

        <p>First, using data reported to EARS-Net, we extracted the age-specific and sex-specific annual number of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in 2015 in each EU and EEA country.

        <p>The same method used for the present study was also applied to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System data for 2007. Information on 2007 self-reported country coverage was retrieved from the authors of the ECDC-EMEA 2009 report 12 on the burden of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA. For comparison, the 2015 results were adjusted to include the same antibiotic resistance-bacterium combinations and countries, and by standardising the populations according to the Eurostat revised standard population. 13The same method used for the present study was also applied to the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System data for 2007.

        <p>We inserted the final designs of the outcome trees into a custom version of the BCoDE modelling toolkit. 14 For each antibiotic-resistant bacterium, five models (one for each type of infection) were made, resulting in 80 disease models that repeated for each EU and EEA country, totalling 2400 models.

        <p>From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we estimated that 671 689 (95% UI 583 148-763 966) cases of infections with selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurred in 2015 in the EU and EEA (table 1). These infections accounted for 33 110 (28 480-38 430) attributable deaths and 874 541 (768 837-989 068) DALYs. These estimates corresponded to an incidence of 131 (113-149) infections per 100 000 population and an attributable mortality of 6•44 (5•54-7•48) deaths per 100 000 population, causing 170 (150-192) DALYs per 100 000 population. YLLs accounted for 85•3% (145 of 170) and BSIs for 71•7% (122 of 170) of total DALYs, suggesting that the attributable mortality estimates affect the final results the most, in particular for BSIs. 67•9% (115 of 170) of the total DALYs per 100 000 were caused by infections with four antibiotic-resistant bacteria with the largest effect on health in our study: third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, MRSA, carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa, and third-generation Figure 1 shows the association between the number of cases, the number of attributable deaths, and the DALYs for each antibiotic resistance combination. The ranking of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria might differ depending on which indicator is used for measuring their health burden. Despite its relatively low incidence, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae had a high burden of disease because of its high attributable mortality, whereas vancomycin-resistant E faecalis and E faecium (which had a similar incidence to carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae) was associated with a low burden of disease.From EARS-Net data collected between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2015, we estimated that 671 689 (95% UI 583 148-763 966) cases of infections with selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria occurred in 2015 in the EU and EEA (table 1).

        <p>Italy and Greece had a substantially higher estimated burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria than other EU and EEA countries, with carbapenem-resistant or colistinresistant bacteria causing a larger proportion of the total burden in Greece than it did in Italy (figure 3). In 2015, in addition to a substantial burden due to infections with carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant bacteria, Portugal and Malta had a substantial burden due to MRSA infections. In Ireland, vancomycin-resistant E faecalis and E faecium caused a higher proportion of the total burden than in other countries. In Spain and Slovenia, a higher proportion of their burden estimates were due to antibiotic-resistant S pneumoniae infections than in other countries.Italy and Greece had a substantially higher estimated burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria than other EU and EEA countries, with carbapenem-resistant or colistinresistant bacteria causing a larger proportion of the total burden in Greece than it did in Italy (figure 3).

        <p>The burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria was focused in the southern and eastern part of the EU and EEA (figure 4). In Croatia, Bulgaria, and Hungary more than 40% of the burden was due to infections with carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant bacteria, but the total burden in these countries was similar to the EU and EEA average. More detailed information on results per country is shown in the appendix (pp 222-55 Although the EU and EEA population-weighted proportion of MRSA among S aureus isolates reported to EARS-Net decreased from 26•6% in 2007 (Diaz Högberg L, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, personal communication) to 16•8% in 2015, our study found that the estimated incidence of MRSA infections increased by 1•28 times (95% UI 1•11-1•47). The estimated age-specific incidence of MRSA in 2007 and 2015 showed that incidence mainly increased in infants and in people aged 55 years or older; appendix p 217).

        <p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the burden of all types of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed in DALYs. We aimed to provide reliable data for population health indicators, through a comprehensive and evidence-based approach, for planning, prioritisation, and to inform policy for control and prevention of this increasing public health threat. Moreover, DALYs allow for comparisons with the burden of other diseases and our incidence-based approach helps to assess the effect of future and control interventions. 16 Our findings show that all age groups are affected by infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, although their burden is significantly higher among infants than in any other age group. Among adults, the burden increases with age, suggesting that the ageing EU and EEA population could result in an increasing burden. In adults and young adults, a higher proportion of the burden was caused by infections with carbapenem-resistant and colistin-resistant bacteria. This finding might be due to a lower risk of complications after an infection in this age group in general, except for patients who are often admitted to hospital and have difficult-to-treat infections because of carbapenem or colistin resistance.To our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate the burden of all types of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria expressed in DALYs.

        <p>Our finding of 170 DALYs per 100 000 population is similar to the combined burden of three major infectious diseases (influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV), which was 183 DALYs per 100 000 population. 17 We estimated that about 75% of the total burden of infections with antibioticresistant bacteria in EU and EEA countries (ie, 127 DALYs per 100 000 population) were associated with health care.Our finding of 170 DALYs per 100 000 population is similar to the combined burden of three major infectious diseases (influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV), which was 183 DALYs per 100 000 population. 17 We estimated that about 75% of the total burden of infections with antibioticresistant bacteria in EU and EEA countries (ie, 127 DALYs per 100 000 population) were associated with health care.</p>

        <p>In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the first estimates of the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the USA, based on 2011 national surveillance data. 18 Our study estimated a 2•6 times higher incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (131 cases per 100 000 population), although attributable mortality was only 1•22 times higher in our study. This increase is due to our conservative approach when defining case fatality of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The structures and resources that are available for the prevention and control of infections with antibioticresistant bacteria might have also caused differences, particularly in health care.In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the first estimates of the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the USA, based on 2011 national surveillance data. 18 Our study estimated a 2•6 times higher incidence of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (131 cases per 100 000 population), although attributable mortality was only 1•22 times higher in our study.

        <p>In 2016, a study 19 estimated the morbidity and mortality associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in France based on 2012 EARS-Net data. We used a similar methodology and found a similar incidence for France. Nevertheless, we estimated fewer MRSA infections, which can partly be explained by the decreasing trends in MRSA infections in France between 2012 and 2015, and much carbapenem-resistant P aeruginosa infections (fewer than 50% of the number in the French study). We also estimated half the number of attributable deaths as in the French study, because of the reduced case fatality proportion stemming from our literature review.In 2016, a study 19 estimated the morbidity and mortality associated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in France based on 2012 EARS-Net data.

        <p>Between 2007 and 2015, the burden increased for all antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

        <p>We were initially surprised to find that the incidence of MRSA infections increased between 2007 and 2015, given that the proportion of MRSA over meticillin-susceptible S aureus had decreased. This increase could be because of 20 and this population has grown since 2007; the improvement of neonatal services, leading to an increased survival of at-risk infants, might have also contributed to further increasing the size of the population at risk for MRSA infection. Studies in Sweden, 21 Finland, 22 and Norway, 23 have also found that incidence of MRSA did not decrease in these countries.We were initially surprised to find that the incidence of MRSA infections increased between 2007 and 2015, given that the proportion of MRSA over meticillin-susceptible S aureus had decreased.

        <p>Italy and Greece have the greatest burden of infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria or a combined 21•3% (171 899 of 874 541) of the EU and EEA total DALYs per 100 000 population and 36•2% (319 019 of 874 541) of EU and EEA DALYs per 100 000 population due to carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant bacteria. Even if one considers its large and ageing population, it is notable that a third of the deaths due to infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA were in Italy. Italy has published its National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-20, 24 which includes targets for the reduction of antibiotic use and the control of healthcare-associated infections. Greece published its National Action Plan (known as Procrustes) in 2010, which outlined the best practices for monitoring and preventing infections due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. 25 Given that, in 2015, most of the burden in Greece was due to infections with carbapenem-resistant or colistinresistant bacteria (overall case fatality proportion of 8•80), there is an urgent need to expand the measures to contain carbapenem-resistant bacteria in this country.Italy and Greece have the greatest burden of infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria or a combined 21•3% (171 899 of 874 541) of the EU and EEA total DALYs per 100 000 population and 36•2% (319 019 of 874 541) of EU and EEA DALYs per 100 000 population due to carbapenem-resistant or colistin-resistant bacteria.

        <p>Considering that, in our study, a large proportion of the burden was due to health-care-associated bloodstream, respiratory tract, or surgical site infections, and that more than half of health-care-associated infections are considered preventable, 28 reducing the burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA through enhanced infection prevention and control measures could be an achievable goal. ECDC recently published guidance on infection prevention and control measures and tools for the prevention of the spread of carbapenemresistant Enterobacteriaceae in hospitals or other health-care settings. 29 Stewardship interventions can be successful at safely reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics in hospitals. 30 A substantial proportion of the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA in 2015 was estimated to have been due to community-associated infections. This finding suggests that antimicrobial stewardship targeting prescribers and infection prevention and control interventions in primary care would also be necessary to reduce the burden of these infections in the EU and EEA.Considering that, in our study, a large proportion of the burden was due to health-care-associated bloodstream, respiratory tract, or surgical site infections, and that more than half of health-care-associated infections are considered preventable, 28 reducing the burden of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA through enhanced infection prevention and control measures could be an achievable goal.

        <p>Our study has several limitations. The disease models were based on the data retrieved from systematic literature reviews, which varied in availability, quality, and representativeness of evidence. We did not grade the strength of evidence supporting each parameter estimate on the basis of the statistical analysis methods used in the clinical outcome studies. Moreover, death from an infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is the result of many factors that are related to the pathogen, patient, and therapy, in particular regarding the delay in the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy. 4 We did not adjust our models for age-specific risks, co-infections, appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, or for type of care, assuming common transition probabilities for all subgroups. However, to cover uncertainties related to the different patient case-mix, we considered studies focusing on specific populations for inclusion in the parameters of the disease models (appendix pp 168-90), and included when pertinent.Our study has several limitations.

ECDC is currently working with countries in the evaluation of all factors affecting the EARS-Net country coverage. We also list limitations related to the factors used for converting the number of BSIs to other types of infection (appendix p 203), including the different time span of the ECDC point prevalence survey (2011-12) and EARS-Net, application of data from the point prevalence survey to community-associated infections, dependence of healthcare-associated infections on the day of measurement, and estimation of non-BSIs (might have been affected by the case-mix of patients and could differ between hospitals). Finally, we defined multidrug-resistant isolates (appendix p 196) on the basis of antibiotic groups frequently used for empirical treatment of BSI as included in EARS-Net.

        <p>The estimated burden of infections with antibioticresistant bacteria in the EU and EEA is substantial compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has increased since 2007. Strategies to prevent and control antibiotic-resistant bacteria require coordination at EU and EEA and global level. However, our study showed that the contribution of various antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the overall burden varies greatly between countries, thus highlighting the need for prevention and control strategies that are tailored to the needs of each country in the EU and EEA. Our study also showed that most of the burden of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU and EEA was health care associated, thus emphasising the need to urgently address antimicrobial resistance as a patient safety issue and the need for alternative treatment options for patients with such infections who have comorbidities or are otherwise vulnerable (eg, because of their poor immune system or age).The estimated burden of infections with antibioticresistant bacteria in the EU and EEA is substantial compared with that of other infectious diseases, and has increased since 2007.
