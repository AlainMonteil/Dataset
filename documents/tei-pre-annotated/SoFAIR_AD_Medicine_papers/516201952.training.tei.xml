        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 2021 1 and has multiple mutations in its spike protein 2 . Here we show that the spike protein of Omicron has a higher affinity for ACE2 compared with Delta, and a marked change in its antigenicity increases Omicron's evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralizing antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralization. Importantly, the antiviral drugs remdesivir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. Replication was similar for Omicron and Delta virus isolates in human nasal epithelial cultures. However, in lung cells and gut cells, Omicron demonstrated lower replication. Omicron spike protein was less efficiently cleaved compared with Delta. The differences in replication were mapped to the entry efficiency of the virus on the basis of spike-pseudotyped virus assays. The defect in entry of Omicron pseudotyped virus to specific cell types effectively correlated with higher cellular RNA expression of TMPRSS2, and deletion of TMPRSS2 affected Delta entry to a greater extent than Omicron. Furthermore, drug inhibitors targeting specific entry pathways 3 demonstrated that the Omicron spike inefficiently uses the cellular protease TMPRSS2, which promotes cell entry through plasma membrane fusion, with greater dependency on cell entry through the endocytic pathway. Consistent with suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage and inability to use TMPRSS2, syncytium formation by the Omicron spike was substantially impaired compared with the Delta spike. The less efficient spike cleavage of Omicron at S1/S2 is associated with a shift in cellular tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells, with implications for altered pathogenesis.The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in 2021 1 and has multiple mutations in its spike protein 2 .

        <p>The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first detected in South Africa 1 , carries over 30 mutations in its spike protein and has now spread internationally at a fast pace. More than 20 substitutions exist in the N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain (RBD). The Omicron variant also contains six unique mutations in S2 (N764K, D796Y, N856K, Q954H, N969K and L981F) that were not previously detected in other variants of concern (VOCs). The spike proteins of the Alpha and Delta variants were previously shown to confer more efficient cell-cell fusion kinetics compared with Wuhan-Hu-1 (refs. 4,5 ) due to mutations in the furin-cleavage site region that increase S1/S2 cleavage. Furthermore, Alpha and Delta showed more efficient syncytia formation, which was previously found to be associated with pathogenesis 6 . Omicron has three mutations in the region of the furin-cleavage site (P681H, H655Y and N679K) and was initially predicted to be highly infectious 7 and pathogenic. Indeed, Omicron has been associated with very rapid increases in case numbers and recent data demonstrate considerable reinfection and vaccine responses 2,8 . However, paradoxically, recent findings suggest reduced severity in Omicron infections compared to Delta 9 .The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first detected in South Africa 1 , carries over 30 mutations in its spike protein and has now spread internationally at a fast pace.

        <p>Here we examine the biological properties of Omicron, and focus on spike-mediated evasion of neutralizing antibodies, increased ACE2 binding affinity, a shift in tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells and compromised ability to generate syncytia.Here we examine the biological properties of Omicron, and focus on spike-mediated evasion of neutralizing antibodies, increased ACE2 binding affinity, a shift in tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells and compromised ability to generate syncytia.</p>
        <p>The Omicron variant has 15 amino acid mutations in the RBD (Supplementary Figs. 1 and2). To understand the impact of these substitutions on receptor engagement, we determined the kinetics and affinity of monomeric human ACE2 binding to immobilized Omicron, Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta RBDs using biolayer interferometry. We observed that the Omicron RBD has approximately threefold enhanced binding affinity for ACE2 relative to the Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta RBDs (Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), consistent with previous findings [10][11][12][13] . As previously observed for the Alpha RBD, which contains only the N501Y mutation 14 , the modulation of binding is mediated by changes in ACE2 dissociation rates. Although the K417N mutation is known to decrease ACE2 engagement 14,15 , a recently determined crystal structure of ACE2-bound Omicron RBD revealed that Q493R and Q498R introduce additional electrostatic interactions with ACE2 residues Glu35 and Asp38, respectively 15 , whereas S477N enables hydrogen-bonding with ACE2 Ser19 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Collectively, these mutations strengthen ACE2 binding, relative to the ancestral isolate. We extended this binding analysis to a cell-based model using cells that were transfected with full-length spike, followed by ACE2 antibody titration; we observed significantly higher ACE2 binding for Omicron spike compared with the spike proteins of the Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta variants (Supplementary Fig. 2). This enhanced binding could be a factor in the enhanced transmissibility of Omicron relative to previous variants.The Omicron variant has 15 amino acid mutations in the RBD (Supplementary Figs. 1 and2).

        <p>Omicron was predicted to have broad resistance to neutralizing antibodies based on mutations in the class I-IV antigenic regions in its RBD 16 . Current standard of care antiviral treatment for moderate to severe COVID-19 includes the use of the monoclonal antibody combination REGN10933 (casivirimab) and REGN10897 (imdevimab). The K417N, E484A, S477N and Q493R mutations preclude REGN10933 binding, whereas G446S clashes with REGN10987, consistent with the decreased binding to the Omicron RBD and S trimer and the loss of neutralization previously descibed 11,15 . We next tested serial dilutions of component monoclonal antibodies, both individually and in combination, against Delta and Omicron live viruses in tissue culture (Fig. 1a). Although the Delta variant was effectively neutralized by casirivimab, imdevimab was only partially effective, consistent with previous data 4 . In combination, these monoclonal antibodies were highly potent against Delta. However, there was a complete loss of neutralizing activity against Omicron by these monoclonal antibodies alone or in combination (Fig. 1a). Given these results, we next tested the direct-acting antivirals remdesivir and the active metabolite of molnupiravir against live viruses. We observed similar antiviral activity against Delta and Omicron using serial titrations of both compounds (Supplementary Fig. 3).Omicron was predicted to have broad resistance to neutralizing antibodies based on mutations in the class I-IV antigenic regions in its RBD 16 .

        <p>An important question is whether vaccine-elicited antibodies are able to neutralize Omicron. We synthesized codon-optimized spike expression plasmids for Omicron and Delta spike proteins and generated pseudotyped virus (PV) particles by co-transfecting the spike expression plasmids with a lentiviral gag-pol-expressing plasmid and a lentiviral transduction plasmid encoding the luciferase gene 17,18 . We obtained longitudinal serum samples from 40 individuals who were vaccinated with either the BNT162b2 or ChAdOx-1 vaccine and performed serum titrations before mixing sera with our reporter PV particles. The participants had a median age of around 70 years and prospective serum samples were taken as follows: one month after dose two, six months after dose two and one month after dose three (Extended Data Table 2). We observed at least tenfold loss of neutralization against Omicron after the second dose compared with Delta (Fig. 1b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4). Indeed, neutralization of Omicron was not detectable for the majority of individuals who had received two doses of ChAdOx-1. We also observed waning over time after the second dose for both vaccines (Fig. 1b,c). Both groups received a booster dose of BNT162b2 as a third dose, enabling us to compare the response to this booster dose. Considerable increases (greater than tenfold) in neutralization against both Omicron and Delta were observed for all of the variants after the third dose of vaccination, suggesting an increase in the breadth of responses as well as titre.An important question is whether vaccine-elicited antibodies are able to neutralize Omicron.

        <p>To confirm the loss of neutralizing activity against Omicron after the second dose, we next used a live virus experimental system to compare Delta and Omicron variants against sera taken four weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2, and obtained similar results to those obtained in the PV assay (Extended Data Fig. 5a). These live viruses were also used to assess the neutralization of the Omicron variant by sera derived from unvaccinated individuals who were previously infected with the early Wuhan-Hu-1 virus or the Delta variant. As expected, vaccine sera had significantly impaired activity against Omicron compared with Delta (Extended Data Fig. 5a). We also tested mRNA-1273 vaccine-elicited sera, which showed a similar reduction in neutralization to BNT162b2. However, coronavac sera showed little neutralization against Delta and 0 out of 9 participants had detectable neutralization against Omicron. Sera from Delta infections appeared to have lower cross-neutralization compared with those from the early pandemic period when Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G was dominant (Extended Data Fig. 5b).To confirm the loss of neutralizing activity against Omicron after the second dose, we next used a live virus experimental system to compare Delta and Omicron variants against sera taken four weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2, and obtained similar results to those obtained in the PV assay (Extended Data Fig. 5a).

        <p>We infected primary human nasal epithelial 3D cultures (hNECs) with an air-liquid interface (Fig. 2a,b). Infection with live SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or Delta was conducted at the apical surface with equal amounts of input virus and virus collected from the apical surface at 24 and 48 h, and virus was quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of the E gene and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ). We observed similar replication kinetics for Omicron and Delta in the hNECs (Fig. 2b). We next infected Calu-3 lung cells (which are known to express endogenous TMPRSS2) with live isolates, and observed significantly greater viral replication for Delta than Omicron (Fig. 2c), manifesting as early as 24 h after infection. We also infected Caco-2 cells, a colon cancer cell line (known to express high levels of endogenous TMPRSS2) 19 and, as for Calu-3, we found 1 log greater Delta RNA and higher infectious virus (TCID 50 ) in the supernatants compared with those observed for Omicron. Finally, we tested a cell line-HeLa, overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2-and obtained similar results to those of the Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells.We infected primary human nasal epithelial 3D cultures (hNECs) with an air-liquid interface (Fig. 2a,b).

        <p>We next sought to examine the possibility that the impaired replication in some cells may be related to differential spike incorporation and/or cleavage. For example, Delta, which is known to have higher replication, is associated with a highly cleaved spike protein 4 . We tested purified virions from two independent Omicron isolate infections. We observed broadly similar amounts of Omicron and Delta spike incorporation into virions generated in VeroE6 ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells (Fig. 2f). However, there was reduced cleavage in whole Omicron virions compared with Delta as evidenced by the ratio of full-length spike to S1 and S2; the Omicron spike was inefficiently cleaved in virions compared with Article Delta (Fig. 2f). However, more substantially reduced Omicron spike cleavage compared with Delta was observed in cell lysates (Fig. 2g).We next sought to examine the possibility that the impaired replication in some cells may be related to differential spike incorporation and/or cleavage.

        <p>Given the lower intracellular S1/S2 cleavage for Omicron versus Delta spike proteins, confocal microscopy was used to examine whether cleavage efficiency is related to differences in subcellular localization. We analysed the distribution of Spike in cells infected with Omicron and Delta SARS-CoV-2 live virus isolates (Fig. 2h-j). No clear differences were observed between the variants in distance from the nucleus or co-localization with a Golgi marker, indicating that the subcellular localization between Delta and Omicron is similar.Given the lower intracellular S1/S2 cleavage for Omicron versus Delta spike proteins, confocal microscopy was used to examine whether cleavage efficiency is related to differences in subcellular localization.

        <p>SARS-CoV-2 spike is a major determinant of viral infectivity and mediates cell entry through interaction with ACE2 (refs. 3,10 ) and either TMPRSS2 (ref. 3 ) at the plasma membrane or cathepsins in the endosomes. The plasma membrane route of entry, and indeed transmissibility and disease severity in animal models, is critically dependent on the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) between S1 and S2 (refs. 6,7 ) and cleavage of spike before virion release from producer cells; this contrasts with the endosomal entry route, which does not require spike cleavage in producer cells 3 . Plasma membrane fusion also enables the virus to avoid restriction factors in the endosomes 7 .SARS-CoV-2 spike is a major determinant of viral infectivity and mediates cell entry through interaction with ACE2 (refs. 3,10 ) and either TMPRSS2 (ref. 3 ) at the plasma membrane or cathepsins in the endosomes.

        <p>We tested spike-mediated viral entry of the wild-type (WT) Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G, Delta and Omicron spike proteins (Fig. 3a) using the PV system. We first probed PV virions for spike protein and, after western blot analysis, noted a reduced incorporation of Omicron spike into virions compared with the incorporation of Delta spike (Extended Data Fig. 6). We also noted that the Omicron spike was less cleaved than the Delta spike, as observed with the live virus (Extended Data Fig. 6). Notably, cleavage of Omicron spike in cells was also lower compared with Delta and WT spike, again similar to that in the live virus.We tested spike-mediated viral entry of the wild-type (WT) Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G, Delta and Omicron spike proteins (Fig. 3a) using the PV system.

        <p>Using normalized amounts of Delta and Omicron spike PV, we infected primary 3D lower-airway organoids and gallbladder organoids 20,21 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6), in addition to Calu-3 lung cells. Mirroring the lower replication of Omicron relative to Delta in live virus assays, we observed impaired entry efficiency for Omicron spike in both organoid systems and the Calu-3 cells in comparison to Delta and WT Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G. By contrast, in H1299 lung cancer epithelial cells, HeLa-ACE2 cells (overexpressing ACE2), and HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 and deleted for TMPRSS2 (293T-A2ΔT2), we did not observe large differences in the entry efficiency of Delta and Omicron (Fig. 3a).Using normalized amounts of Delta and Omicron spike PV, we infected primary 3D lower-airway organoids and gallbladder organoids 20,21 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6), in addition to Calu-3 lung cells.

        <p>To further examine our PV entry and infection findings, we studied the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across our target cells using qPCR analysis of RNA extracts from cell lysates (Fig. 3b). We found greater levels of TMPRSS2 mRNA in cells in which Omicron PV entry was impaired relative to Delta-for example, Calu-3 cells and organoids had higher levels of TMPRSS2 mRNA compared with H1299, HeLa-ACE2 and 293T-A2ΔT2 cells. ACE2 levels were variable as expected, and did not appear to be correlated with differences in infection between Omicron 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 and Delta PV.

        <p>To experimentally demonstrate differential usage of TMPRSS2 as a cofactor for virus entry by Omicron, we directly compared the efficiency of viral entry between 293T-A2ΔT2 and 293T-A2T2 cells. Enhanced infectivity was observed for both the WT and Delta when TMPRSS2 was overexpressed, suggesting that TMPRSS2 is also required for their optimal virus entry. By contrast, no difference was observed Infectivity (RLU/RT activity) for Omicron PV, indicating that Omicron is inefficient in using TMPRSS2 for its entry (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that the modest degree of TMPRSS2-dependent enhancement (3.4×) for Delta and a complete lack of enhancement for Omicron over a single infection round might relate to the overexpression of ACE2 in this system. To examine this possibility, we tested standard HEK293T cells expressing low endogenous levels of ACE2 and those transduced to overexpress TMPRSS2 (293T-T2). Indeed, we observed a much greater increase in infection for Delta (34×) under TMPRSS2 overexpression conditions and a smaller increase (6×) for Omicron in the presence of overexpressed TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3d). Together, these data support a reduced contribution of TMPRSS2 cofactor usage by Omicron spike, with modulation of the effect size by ACE2 expression levels. Given previous data on the relationship between S1/ S2 cleavage in producer cells and TMPRSS2 dependence 22,23 , the most likely explanation for altered TMPRSS2 usage is the suboptimal S1/S2 cleavage in Omicron leading to inefficient S2′ processing and fusion peptide exposure.To experimentally demonstrate differential usage of TMPRSS2 as a cofactor for virus entry by Omicron, we directly compared the efficiency of viral entry between 293T-A2ΔT2 and 293T-A2T2 cells.

        <p>A change in the use of TMPRSS2 for entry would be predicted to alter the entry pathway of the virus (Fig. 3e). To test the hypothesis that the entry route preference by Omicron spike is changed, we used inhibitors of proteases specific to either the endocytic pathway (E64d blockade of cathepsins) or the plasma membrane pathway (camostat blockade of TMPRSS2). We reasoned that, if Omicron has become more dependent on the endocytic cell entry route, it should be more sensitive to cathepsin inhibition. We infected A549 cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (A549-A2T2) cells in the presence of serial dilutions of E64d or camostat. Indeed, E64d had a greater effect on cell entry by Omicron PVs versus Delta PVs and, conversely, camostat had a greater effect on the entry of Delta PVs (Fig. 3f). We next performed this experiment with live virus isolates, using an indicator lung cell line (A549-A2T2) with a similar, albeit less marked, result as shown for PV (Fig. 3g). These drug data in both live virus and PV systems further support the shift in tropism away from TMPRSS2-expressing cells.A change in the use of TMPRSS2 for entry would be predicted to alter the entry pathway of the virus (Fig. 3e).

        <p>Having established that TMPRSS2 modulates entry mediated by Delta to a greater extent than for Omicron BA.1 spike, we sought to understand the distribution of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human respiratory cells. We used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from five locations in the human lungs 24 . The comparison revealed higher expression of TMPRSS2 in alveolar AT1 and AT2 pneumocytes and, in general, lower expression in the trachea (upper airway; Extended Data Fig. 7). ACE2 expression was generally lower overall, but appeared to be higher in AT1 and AT2 cells compared with in other cell types, and also in club cells 25 . We experimentally extended these findings by performing qPCR analysis of human lung tissue samples 26 , showing higher mRNA expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung parenchyma (alveolar) tissue compared with in the upper-airway bronchial tissues and a trend towards ACE2 being higher in the upper-airway tissue (Fig. 3h).Having established that TMPRSS2 modulates entry mediated by Delta to a greater extent than for Omicron BA.1 spike, we sought to understand the distribution of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression in human respiratory cells.

        <p>Given the requirement of TMPRSS2 for optimal cell-cell fusion, we hypothesized that Omicron may be impaired in mediating this process. We used a split GFP system 34 to monitor cell-cell fusion in real time (Fig. 4a). As a control to show that spike cleavage is needed for fusion in our assay system, we titrated CMK (a furin inhibitor) into donor cell medium before transfection with spike-expressing plasmids, observing dose-dependent inhibition of fusion (Extended Data Fig. 8). As a further control to demonstrate the need for ACE2 engagement by expressed spike, we tested the ability of convalescent serum containing neutralizing antibodies to block cell-cell fusion.

We proceeded to transfect spike-bearing plasmids into HEK293T cells expressing GFP1-10 and Vero E6 cells stably expressing GFP11, such that the GFP signal could be detected after cellcell fusion and measured over time. (Fig. 4c,d). We observed increased fusion for Delta spike compared with D614G Wuhan-Hu-1 spike (Fig. 4d).

        <p>We predicted that poor fusion would impair cell-cell spread of Omicron, and analysed infection focus size using live virus infection of H1299 cells, in which we have shown similar entry efficiency for Omicron and Delta spike PV (Fig. 3). Infection foci in spreading virus infections occur because of localized (cell-to-cell) infection, probably facilitated by syncytium formation. The infection was followed by overlay of semi-solid medium (carboxymethylcellulose) to inhibit cell-free infection, thereby favouring cell-cell infection. Infected cells were stained with an anti-S antibodies, and local spread was characterized by the staining of foci visible to the naked eye (Fig. 4e). Omicron infection resulted in slightly higher numbers of foci (Fig. 4e-g), but each infection focus was substantially smaller in size relative to those formed by Delta infection (Fig. 4e). For a more detailed view of the foci, we imaged at a higher magnification using a microscope objective, and used cells that were imaged 2 h after infection with ancestral virus-when relatively little viral transmission is expected to be completed-as an approximate measure of the size of a single cell (Extended Data Fig. 8). We compared this to cells that were infected for 18 h by Omicron or Delta isolates. The size of foci at 2 h after infection with ancestral virus was 1.2 × 10 3 µm 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-1.5 × 10 3 ). The size of Omicron foci was 1.5 × 10 3 µm 2 (95% CI = 1.4-1.5 × 10 3 ) and, by contrast, the size of Delta foci was 3.4 × 10 3 µm 2 (95% CI = 3.1-3.7 × 10 3 ), 2.3-fold higher than Omicron (Extended Data Fig. 8). Together, these results show that localized cell-cell infection of Omicron is reduced relative to Delta, consistent with attenuated cell-cell fusion.We predicted that poor fusion would impair cell-cell spread of Omicron, and analysed infection focus size using live virus infection of H1299 cells, in which we have shown similar entry efficiency for Omicron and Delta spike PV (Fig. 3).

        <p>Here we examined the biological properties of Omicron from the perspectives of spike-mediated immune evasion, ACE2-binding interactions and cellular entry pathways that likely dictate tissue tropism. First, we have shown that the Omicron spike confers substantial evasion of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies that is greater for ChAdOx-1 versus BNT162b2 vaccine sera. In longitudinally sampled participants, second-dose waning was mitigated by a third dose of an mRNA vaccination that also increased and broadened neutralization of Omicron in the short term. This observation is critical for informing third-dose vaccination efforts worldwide. Notably, ChAdOx-1 is widely used in low-income settings in which third doses of mRNA vaccines are not widely available, and Omicron may contribute to higher infection rates in such settings unless third doses can be implemented. Of further concern for low-income countries was the absence of any neutralizing activity to Omicron in sera after two doses of coronavac in all nine participants, in addition to poor Delta neutralization.Here we examined the biological properties of Omicron from the perspectives of spike-mediated immune evasion, ACE2-binding interactions and cellular entry pathways that likely dictate tissue tropism.

        <p>Despite the presence of three mutations that are individually predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the observed cleavage of spike in cells infected with live virus was lower compared with Delta and WT Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G. Similarly, live Omicron virions had a lower proportion of cleaved spike compared with Delta. Cleavage deficiency was also evident in PV particles. We previously noted that the proportion of cleaved spike was lower within cells as compared to virions 4 , suggesting that the incorporation of spike into virions produced in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment may favour cleaved spike over full-length spike, or be cleaved as virions are secreted through exocytic pathways 36 .Despite the presence of three mutations that are individually predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, the observed cleavage of spike in cells infected with live virus was lower compared with Delta and WT Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G.

        <p>Live Omicron virus showed a significant replication defect compared with Delta in cell culture systems in which TMPRSS2 was present. Omicron spike was also associated with decreased entry relative to both WT and Delta spike proteins in target lower-airway organoids, gallbladder organoids or Calu-3 lung cells expressing TMPRSS2, but displayed no difference in cells with low TMPRSS2 expression, for example H1299, HeLa-ACE2 and 293T-A2 cells. We proceeded to directly compare entry in ACE2-overexpressing cells in which TMPRSS2 was either knocked down or overexpressed, and showed that Omicron entry was not affected by variations in TMPRSS2 expression, in contrast to WT and Delta spike PV entry. Importantly, when ACE2 was not overexpressed, we observed a large increase in Delta PV entry with TMPRSS2 availability, and a much smaller increase in entry for Omicron. These data suggest that TMPRSS2 cofactor usage may be affected by ACE2 levels. The hypothesis that Omicron spike has altered its preference to the cathepsin-dependent endosomal route of entry (TMPRSS2 independent) was borne out by inhibitor experiments against cathepsin and TMPRSS2 in both PV and live virus isolates.Live Omicron virus showed a significant replication defect compared with Delta in cell culture systems in which TMPRSS2 was present.

        <p>TMPRSS2 is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family. This family comprises 17 members with diverse physiological functions. These proteins require activation and remain associated with membranes, and TMPRSS2 in particular can undergo autocatalytic activation 37 , although its role in human physiology is unclear. TMPRSS2 has been shown to be a cofactor for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS as well as SARS-CoV-2 (refs. 3,38 ). Importantly, TMPRSS2 dependence is correlated with efficient cleavage at the PBCS between S1/S2 (refs. 22,23 ), with the removal of the furin-cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 reducing TMPRSS2 dependence. By contrast, in experiments in which a furin-cleavage site was introduced into SARS-CoV-1, the virus demonstrated greater TMPRSS2 dependence.TMPRSS2 is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family.

        <p>Omicron presents an interesting parallel to SARS-CoV-1, which is not cleaved in the producer cell due to lack of the PBCS but, rather, on the target cell surface by TMPRSS2 or by cathepsins in endosomes. SARS-CoV-1 is able to infect cells though TMPRSS2 (and therefore syncytia can be induced) 29 or by endocytosis 3,23 . The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant appears to also favour endocytosis through reduced cleavage efficiency of spike impairing TMPRSS2-mediated entry. Indeed, the accumulated mutations in omicron include multiple additional basic amino acids leading to an increase in the overall charge of the S protein. This change may make S more sensitive to low-pH-induced conformational changes, and be an adaptation that facilitates the use of the low-pH endosomal entry route, and/or be an adaptation to entry in the lower pH environment in the upper airway. Furthermore, our analysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets and direct qPCR measurements on human respiratory tissue samples suggest that lung cells have higher TMPRSS2 mRNA compared with cells found in the upper airway. Indeed recent data indicate lower virus burden in deep lung tissue and reduced pathogenicity in Omicron versus Delta infections using Syrian hamster models 39 .Omicron presents an interesting parallel to SARS-CoV-1, which is not cleaved in the producer cell due to lack of the PBCS but, rather, on the target cell surface by TMPRSS2 or by cathepsins in endosomes.

        <p>As expected from suboptimal cleavage of spike in producer cells, and the known link between efficient spike cleavage and ability to use TMPRSS2 for cell entry/cell-cell fusion, we observed that the Omicron spike protein has low fusogenic potential. This phenomenon could translate to impaired cell-cell spread and, indeed, we observed smaller plaque sizes for Omicron compared with Delta in a system in which cell-free infection was limited by semi-solid medium. The smaller focus size for Omicron could be attributable to a failure to induce syncytia, without compromised entry efficiency given that a similar number of foci was observed. The semi-solid medium prevented cell-free infection and our measurement should therefore primarily reflect infection spread over a limited time period through syncytia formation. However, the smaller foci could have differing implications in vivo. First, there may be decreased virus production due to less cell death, therefore favouring Omicron over Delta. Alternatively, syncytia along with cell survival and larger infection foci may increase spread, thereby favouring Delta. The difference in outcome from syncytia is likely to be cell and tissue dependent and we caution against extrapolating these in vitro infection data to viral loads in the respiratory tract.As expected from suboptimal cleavage of spike in producer cells, and the known link between efficient spike cleavage and ability to use TMPRSS2 for cell entry/cell-cell fusion, we observed that the Omicron spike protein has low fusogenic potential.

        <p>Our data showing tropism differences for Omicron in organoid systems and human nasal epithelial cultures are limited by the fact that they are in vitro systems, albeit using primary human tissue. Note also that levels of TMPRSS2 may affect ACE2, particularly as TMPRSS2 has been implicated in ACE2 cleavage 40 and our effect sizes were affected by ACE2 expression. Finally, E64d may inhibit viral protease in addition to host cellular cathepsins, and this may have affected the strength of the observed phenotype.Our data showing tropism differences for Omicron in organoid systems and human nasal epithelial cultures are limited by the fact that they are in vitro systems, albeit using primary human tissue.

        <p>In summary, Omicron has gained immune evasion properties while compromising cell entry in TMPRSS2-expressing cells such as those in alveoli, as well as compromising syncytia formation-a combination of traits consistent with reduced pathogenicity in vivo. Crucially, experience with Omicron has demonstrated that predictions regarding replication and tropism based on sequence alone can be misleading, and a detailed molecular understanding of the phenotypic impact of complex sets of mutations is vital as variants continue to emerge.In summary, Omicron has gained immune evasion properties while compromising cell entry in TMPRSS2-expressing cells such as those in alveoli, as well as compromising syncytia formation-a combination of traits consistent with reduced pathogenicity in vivo.

        <p>Quantification of viral replication in A549-ACE2/TMPRSS2-based luminescent reporter cells was performed as previously described (ref. 55 ). In brief, A549-A2T2 reporter cells (clone E8) over-expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and SARS-CoV-2 Papain-like protease-activatable circularly permuted firefly luciferase (FFluc) were seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well plates. The next day, the cells were treated with the indicated doses of camostat or E64d for 2 h, then infected with the Delta (EPI_ ISL_1731019) or Omicron (M21021166) variant of SARS-CoV-2 at an m.o.i. of 0.01. After 24 h, the cells were lysed in Dual-Glo Luciferase Buffer (Promega) diluted 1:1 with PBS and 1% NP-40. Lysates were then transferred to opaque 96-well plates, and viral replication was quantified as the ratio of FFluc/Rluc luminescence measured using the Dual-Glo kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Percentage inhibition was calculated relative to the maximum luminescence signal for each condition, then analysed using the Sigmoidal, 4PL, X is log(concentration) function in

        <p>Spike genomes for the original Wuhan strain, and Omicron VOC were obtained from GISAID EpiCoV database accessed on 30th November 2021. A consensus Spike genome was created from all complete and high-coverage genomes, excluding all sequences with &gt;5% Ns using 
            <rs type="software">Geneious Prime</rs> v.
            <rs type="version">2022</rs>. The consensus genome was translated to poly-proteins and the spike gene was aligned to the original Wuhan strain using 
            <rs type="software">mafft</rs> (v.
            <rs type="version">7.</rs>490) 41 with the parameters --globalpair --maxiterate 1000 flags.
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively, 3D structural models of the spike homotrimer protein complex were generated using 
            <rs type="software">Alphafold</rs> (v.
            <rs type="version">2.1.1</rs>) 42 . In its validation at the 14th edition of the 
            <rs type="software">Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction</rs> (CASP14), the predictions generated were demonstrated to be comparative to experimental structures. When a close homologue structure is available to 
            <rs type="software">Alphafold</rs>, the predictions that it generates for those positions are within typical experimental error. The required databases were downloaded on 2 December 2021. The program was run with the parameters --max_template_date=2021-12-01 --model_ preset=monomer --db_preset=full_dbs --is_prokaryote_list=false. Protein structures were visualized in 
            <rs type="software">ChimeraX</rs> (v.
            <rs type="version">1.3</rs>) 43 . As predicted structures for the whole spike protein include poorly resolved chains at the terminal ends, these residues were identified by overlaying structures on Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 6ZP2, then selected and removed from PDB files using the delete atoms/bonds action. Two further monomers were overlayed on 6ZP2 to generate a homotrimer structure. Mutated residues were then coloured in red and labelled manually with respect to the Wuhan strain.

        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.529) models in Extended Data Fig. 1a were generated using the cryo-EM structure PDB 7A94 as a reference. The experimental structure has been resolved in open conformational state with one RBD in the 'up' conformation bound to ACE2. To generate the complete structure, the missing loop regions in the structure (71-75, 625-632, 677-688, 828-852 and 941-943) were modelled using the 
            <rs type="software">Modeller</rs> plug-in 2 . The hACE2 structure in the template also had six residues missing patches that were added by using PDB 1R42 as a reference 3 . The top model was selected on the basis of the zDOPE score and the least root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the reference structure. To create variant models, mutations were induced using the Dunbrack 2010 backbone-dependent rotamer library in 
            <rs type="software">Chimera</rs>
            <rs type="version">4</rs> . Further processing of steps involving minimization and peptide bond building (after deletions for B.1.617.2 and B.1.529 spike) were performed using the Gromacs. The resultant Delta and Omicron modelled complexes have 3,988 and 3,994 residues, respectively, with spike trimer consisting of three chains (14-1,146 residues). The structural superimposition of the Delta and Omicron spike model with the cryo-EM structure displayed an overall r.m.s.d. of 0.66 Å and 0.87 Å, respectively. All of the molecular images were rendered using

        <p>Assays were performed on an Octet Red (ForteBio) instrument at 30 °C with shaking at 1,000 rpm. Streptavidin (SA) biosensors were hydrated in water for 10 min before a 1 min incubation in undiluted 10× kinetics buffer. SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, Delta or Omicron RBDs were loaded at 2.5 µg ml -1 in 10× kinetics buffer for 100-150 s before baseline equilibration for 120 s in 10× kinetics buffer. Human ACE2 association with Wuhan, Delta and Omicron RBDs was assessed in 10× kinetics buffer at various concentrations in a threefold dilution series from 333.3 to 4.1 nM and carried out for 300 s before dissociation for 300 s. The data were normalized to the baseline and fitting was performed using a 1:1 binding model and the
