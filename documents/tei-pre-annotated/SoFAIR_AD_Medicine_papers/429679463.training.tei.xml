        <p>Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation &gt;94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020.Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation &gt;94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020.</p>
        <p>INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d.INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d.</p>
        <p>The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group. RESULTS Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42% hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care.The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7).

        <p>n the first 6 months of the pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide and has infected nearly 20 million people. 1,2 As of August 10, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, resulted in more than 163 000 deaths in the United States and more than 730 000 worldwide. 2 Many infected people are asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and recover without medical intervention. 3,4 However, older people and those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease are at higher risk of life-threatening illness. 5,6 Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug whose active metabolite inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, structurally conserved enzymes that play a key role in the replication of a broad range of viruses, including Coronaviridae. [7][8][9] A first randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir among patients with COVID-19 conducted in Wuhan, China, could not complete enrollment to meaningfully assess efficacy. 10 However, in a larger randomized, double-blind clinical trial, patients with severe COVID-19 treated with a 10-day course of remdesivir had a significantly shorter time to recovery than those receiving placebo (11 days vs 15 days). 11 Subsequently, a randomized, open-label trial showed that patients with severe COVID-19 with relative hypoxia or requiring oxygen support but not requiring ventilatory support had outcomes with 5-and 10-day courses of remdesivir that were not significantly different. 12 These results prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to grant Emergency Use Authorization of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19 and the European Medicines Agency to grant conditional marketing authorization to remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 in patients 12 years of age or older with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen. 13,14 Concurrent with these studies, this randomized, open-label, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of remdesivir administered for 5 or 10 days vs standard care in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19.n the first 6 months of the pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide and has infected nearly 20 million people. 1,2 As of August 10, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, resulted in more than 163 000 deaths in the United States and more than 730 000 worldwide. 2 Many infected people are asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and recover without medical intervention. 3,4 However, older people and those with comorbid hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease are at higher risk of life-threatening illness. 5,6 Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug whose active metabolite inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, structurally conserved enzymes that play a key role in the replication of a broad range of viruses, including Coronaviridae.

        <p>Patients were enrolled at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia between March 15, 2020, and April 18, 2020, and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive up to a 5-day course of remdesivir, up to a 10-day course of remdesivir, or standard care. Randomization was not stratified. The randomization list was created and validated by the interactive web response system (IWRS) vendor. A dummy randomization list was provided in 
            <rs type="creator">Microsoft</rs> Excel format to the biostatistician employed by the study sponsor for review. A separate list of sequential patient numbers within each treatment group was generated by the IWRS vendor. The randomization had a block size of 6. Based on the treatment from the randomization list, the IWRS provided the next sequential patient number to the site along with the treatment group assignment. The appropriate number of vials of open-label study drug were assigned to the patient. Sites did not have access to the randomization list and could not know the sequence of treatments. Treatment was open label because the sponsor had an insufficient number of placebocontaining vials to support this trial.

        <p>Patient assessments included physical examination, respiratory status (respiratory rate, type of oxygen supplementation, blood oxygen saturation, and radiographic findings), adverse events, and concomitant medications. On study days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 14, blood samples were obtained for measurement of blood cell counts, serum creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, and liver transaminases. Self-reported fixed race and ethnicity categories were collected as part of the demographic information to assess possible differences in disease severity or response to treatment. Site investigators assessed clinical status daily from day 1 through day 14 or hospital discharge on a 7-point ordinal scale 11,12 consisting of the following categories: 1, death; 2, hospitalized, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; 3, hospitalized, requiring noninvasive ventilation or use of high-flow oxygen devices; 4, hospitalized, requiring low-flow supplemental oxygen; 5, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (related or not to COVID-19); 6, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen or ongoing medical care; and 7, not hospitalized (eTable 1 in Supplement 3).

        <p>We calculated that 600 patients (200 in each group) would provide greater than 85% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.8 for each remdesivir group vs the standard care group using a 2-sided significance level of .05. The odds ratio of 1.8 was calculated based on proposed group sizes at the time of study conception and was not intended as a minimum clinically meaningful treatment effect, as no prior data were available on the distribution of clinical status categories over time in patients with moderate COVID-19. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates changes in clinical status across all categories toward category 7 for the remdesivir groups vs the standard care group. All patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of remdesivir, or for the standard care group, had the day 1 visit, were assessed for efficacy and adverse events. For clinical status, the ordinal score was recorded as 1 on the day of death and all subsequent days; if a patient was discharged, the ordinal score was recorded as 7 on the day of discharge alive and all subsequent days unless the patient was rehospitalized for COVID-19-related reasons; otherwise, the most recent assessment was used for missing values.

        <p>Of 612 patients who consented and were assessed for eligibility, 596 underwent randomization and 584 began the study: 193 began a 10-day course of remdesivir, 191 patients began a 5-day course of remdesivir, and 200 continued standard care (Figure 1). Of the 16 patients who were not randomized, 13 did not meet eligibility criteria and 3 withdrew consent. Twelve randomized patients did not receive treatment: 8 withdrew consent, 3 had protocol violations, and 1 was withdrawn by investigator discretion. Patients in the 3 groups were balanced in demographics and disease characteristics (Table 1). Overall, 56% of patients had cardiovascular disease, 42% had hypertension, 40% had diabetes, and 14% had asthma. Although all patients had an oxygen saturation above 94% while breathing room air at screening, 12% of patients in the 10-day remdesivir group, 16% in the 5-day remdesivir group, and 19% in the standard care group used supplemental oxygen on day 1 because of deteriorating clinical status or for breathing comfort. Patients in all groups had been hospitalized a median of 2 days (interquartile range [IQR], 1-3 days) before study day 1. The median duration of symptoms before day 1 in the standard care group was 9 days (IQR, 6-11 days) compared with 8 days (IQR, 5-11 days) for both groups receiving remdesivir. Patients randomized to the standard care group were more commonly prescribed other agents with putative activity against COVID-19 (Table 1).Of 612 patients who consented and were assessed for eligibility, 596 underwent randomization and 584 began the study: 193 began a 10-day course of remdesivir, 191 patients began a 5-day course of remdesivir, and 200 continued standard care (Figure 1). Of the 16 patients who were not randomized, 13 did not meet eligibility criteria and 3 withdrew consent. Twelve randomized patients did not receive treatment: 8 withdrew consent, 3 had protocol violations, and 1 was withdrawn by investigator discretion. Patients in the 3 groups were balanced in demographics and disease characteristics (Table 1).

        <p>may have been influenced by the assigned duration of remdesivir therapy. Rates of discharge peaked on the day after the end of dosing in both groups: on day 6 for the 5-day group and on day 11 for the 10-day group (eFigure 1 in Supplement 3). However, when outcomes at days 14 and 28 were evaluated, similar distributions of clinical status were observed between patients in the remdesivir groups, possibly pointing to differences compared with standard care. Patients were not stratified by site at enrollment, which may have led to imbalances in patient care and discharge practices. In addition, the possibility that additional days of hospitalization and remdesivir treatment for patients in the 10-day group had a negative effect on outcomes cannot be excluded, although the rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events and serious adverse events were not higher in the 10-day remdesivir group than in the 5-day remdesivir and standard care groups.may have been influenced by the assigned duration of remdesivir therapy.

        <p>There was no a priori knowledge of the trajectories of patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 disease-those with confirmed infiltrates by radiology, but with room-air oxygen saturations greater than 94% at rest. The majority of these patients were enrolled within 2 days of hospitalization, yet 15% received supplemental oxygen on day 1. This is a relevant observation for future trials as the ordinal clinical status scales used to date do not take into account oxygen saturation values or oxygen supplies and patterns of use in different health systems. 17 In the ACTT-1 and RECOVERY trials, mortality and treatment effects were strongly influenced by clinical status at randomization, confirming a spectrum of severity among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 11,17 Future trials should consider studying individual severity strata incorporating further clarification and refinements in their definitions. Factors that contribute to patients progressing to severe and critical COVID-19 remain to be elucidated. The risk of rapid disease progression described to date points to the potential benefit of earlier intervention with an effective antiviral. 6,18There was no a priori knowledge of the trajectories of patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 disease-those with confirmed infiltrates by radiology, but with room-air oxygen saturations greater than 94% at rest.

        <p>This study has several limitations. First, the original protocol was written when COVID-19 cases were largely confined to Asia and the clinical understanding of disease was limited to case series. 19,20 This led to a change in the primary end point on the first day of study enrollment as it became clear that hospital discharge rates varied greatly across regions and the ordinal scale had become standard for interventional COVID-19 studies. 11,21 Second, the study used an open-label design, which potentially led to biases in patient care and reporting of data. Third, because of the urgent circumstances in which the study was conducted, virologic outcomes such as effect of remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 viral load were not assessed. Fourth, other laboratory parameters that may have aided in identifying additional predictors of outcomes were not routinely collected. Fifth, the ordinal scale used to evaluate outcomes was not ideal for detecting differences in patients with moderate COVID-19, especially for a clinical situation in which discharge decisions may be driven by factors other than clinical improvement.This study has several limitations.
