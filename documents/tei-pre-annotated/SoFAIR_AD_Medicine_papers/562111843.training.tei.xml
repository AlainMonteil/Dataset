        <p>RESULTS A total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P &lt; .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16).RESULTS A total of 10 930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included.

        <p>The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs). For the duration of IMV therapy, investigators supplied the mean difference and associated 95% CIs in days comparing the treatment and control groups. For the 90-day outcomes, the trial investigators were asked to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs (or log hazard ratios and associated standard errors) using Cox regression. Inconsistency in associations among the trials was quantified using the I 2 statistic. P values for heterogeneity were derived using the Cochran Q statistic. Precise P values were reported; however, the prospective metaanalysis protocol specified that a threshold for statistical significance would not be used. As a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome of 28-day all-cause mortality, overall asso-ciations also were estimated using random-effects metaanalyses with a restricted maximum likelihood estimate of heterogeneity 16 and Hartung-Knapp adjustment 17,18 to account for uncertainty in the estimation of between-study variance. To obtain illustrative absolute risk estimates for patients not receiving treatment with IL-6 antagonists, a mortality risk of 25% and a progression risk of 33% to IMV or death were assumed (the approximate risks among all eligible patients allocated to usual care or placebo). Metaanalytic ORs were then applied to obtain the corresponding risk with IL-6 antagonists. Because outcome data were generally complete or nearly complete across trials, we restricted the analyses to trial participants with outcomes recorded.The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs).

        <p>Differences in associations between the subgroups were quantified by calculating ratios of ORs (or analogous statistics for other outcome types) to compare the effects in the subgroups along with corresponding P values for interaction. If the ratio of ORs was equal to 1, the estimated associations in the 2 subgroups were the same. The further the ratio of ORs was from 1, the greater was the difference between the estimated associations in the 2 subgroups. Comparisons between subgroups defined by trial characteristics were made using random-effects meta-regression and appropriately accounted for common controls 19 in trials with 3 treatment groups. Comparisons between subgroups defined by patient characteristics were done by estimating trial-specific ratios of ORs comparing associations between subgroups and then combining these in meta-analyses. 20 The ORs in patients not receiving corticosteroids were compared with patients receiving corticosteroids at randomization within the respiratory support subgroups. Subgroup-specific estimates adjusted to correspond with the ratios of ORs that were derived from the within-trial approach were also estimated.Differences in associations between the subgroups were quantified by calculating ratios of ORs (or analogous statistics for other outcome types) to compare the effects in the subgroups along with corresponding P values for interaction.

        <p>The median age across the trials was 61 years (range of medians, 52-68 years) and 3560 patients (33%) were women. Concurrent treatments at randomization varied substantially among the trials. Most patients received respiratory support at randomization. A greater proportion of patients in the sarilumab trials received IMV (31% [873/3136 patients]) compared with patients in the tocilizumab trials (15% [1211/8134 patients]) and a smaller proportion received corticosteroids (35% [890/3136 patients] vs 66% [5317/8134 patients], respectively; Table 1). The primary outcome was missing for 183 patients (1.6%). Three trials recorded no deaths by 28 days Risk of bias was assessed to be low in 22 of the trials contributing to the meta-analysis of 28-day all-cause mortality, comprising 78% of the weight in the analysis. Six trials were judged to have some concerns, mainly due to small numbers of patients being excluded from the data set because they did not receive their assigned intervention. In 1 trial judged as high risk, comprising 0.65% of the weight, the usual procedures were not in place to ensure that the allocation sequence was concealed; however, there was no reason to suspect that the concealed allocation was not implemented as intended. Risk of bias assessments were similar for progression to IMV or death. For secondary infections, results from open-label trials were judged to have some concerns over bias in determining whether such infections had occurred due to the subjective nature of the decision (eFigure 2 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).The median age across the trials was 61 years (range of medians, 52-68 years) and 3560 patients (33%) were women. Concurrent treatments at randomization varied substantially among the trials. Most patients received respiratory support at randomization. A greater proportion of patients in the sarilumab trials received IMV (31% [873/3136 patients]) compared with patients in the tocilizumab trials (15% [1211/8134 patients]) and a smaller proportion received corticosteroids (35% [890/3136 patients] vs 66% [5317/8134 patients], respectively; Table 1). The primary outcome was missing for 183 patients (1.6%). Three trials recorded no deaths by 28 days Risk of bias was assessed to be low in 22 of the trials contributing to the meta-analysis of 28-day all-cause mortality, comprising 78% of the weight in the analysis. Six trials were judged to have some concerns, mainly due to small numbers of patients being excluded from the data set because they did not receive their assigned intervention.

        <p>In this prospective meta-analysis based on 10 930 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 27 randomized clinical trials, administration of IL-6 antagonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality 28 days after randomization. Administration of IL-6 antagonists also was associated with lower progression to IMV or death, cardiovascular support or death, and KRT or death in patients not receiving support for the corresponding organ at randomization and with a greater probability of being discharged alive by 28 days. Administration of IL-6 antagonists was not associated with an increased risk of 28-day infection compared with usual care or placebo. There was no clear association between administration of IL-6 antagonists and all-cause mortality at 90 days or in the duration of IMV among patients who required IMV at randomization; however, the data were limited. Among the a priori-defined subgroups, the association of IL-6 antagonists with improved outcomes appeared more marked among patients who were receiving corticosteroids at randomization compared with those who were not. The association of IL-6 antagonists with lower 28-day all-cause mortality was more marked among patients who did not require IMV at randomization, consistent with the inverse association of progression to IMV or death among these patients. However, these differences between subgroups may have arisen due to sampling variation. Associations appeared broadly consistent across patient subgroups according to levels of cardiovascular support, C-reactive protein level, age, and sex.In this prospective meta-analysis based on 10 930 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from 27 randomized clinical trials, administration of IL-6 antagonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality 28 days after randomization.

        <p>In general, associations with improved outcomes were more marked for tocilizumab than for sarilumab, although comparisons between tocilizumab and sarilumab were indirect (made between trials). However, the trials of sarilumab were generally done earlier in the pandemic than those of tocilizumab and before corticosteroids became the standard of care. 7 The majority of patients in trials of sarilumab were not receiving corticosteroids at randomization, whereas the majority of patients in trials of tocilizumab were receiving corticosteroids at randomization. When comparisons were made within groups defined by receipt of corticosteroids at randomization, the differences between associations for these 2 IL-6 antagonists were less marked. Nearly 3 times as many patients were randomized to trials comparing tocilizumab with usual care or placebo compared with trials comparing sarilumab with usual care or placebo. For this reason, associations were estimated more precisely for tocilizumab than for sarilumab. Both drugs were IL-6 receptor antagonists, but there may be differences between tocilizumab and sarilumab in receptor binding or lung concentrations. 25 Concurrent administration of IL-6 antagonists 5 and corticosteroids, 26 which both have anti-inflammatory effects, may provide greater improvement than either type of drug given individually. 8,9 This prospective meta-analysis included an estimated 97% of patients randomized to IL-6 receptor antagonists vs usual care worldwide. Because data were shared based on standardized definitions of outcomes and subgroups agreed upon in advance, these aggregate data meta-analyses had many of the advantages of individual-patient data meta-analyses while avoiding the need to establish formal data sharing agreements. The methods used in this meta-analysis limit bias in the selection and appraisal of trials with prespecified subgroup analyses based on clinically relevant questions. For tocilizumab, the results from other trials were similar to those from the large RECOVERY trial, supporting generalizability of the findings across settings.In general, associations with improved outcomes were more marked for tocilizumab than for sarilumab, although comparisons between tocilizumab and sarilumab were indirect (made between trials).

        <p>This study has several limitations. First, some of the included trials are ongoing and have not been published in peerreviewed journals. It is possible that lack of participation or participation by some of the ongoing trials may be based on knowledge of their interim results. This limitation was addressed in the sensitivity analyses and the results were consistent with the primary analyses.This study has several limitations.

        <p>Second, there were limited data for some comparisons and questions of interest such as IL-6 antagonists vs corticosteroids and the effect of siltuximab. Third, potential differences in treatment effect by differences in the baseline risk of death (eg, that arose either from trial-specific eligibility criteria, geographic differences, or improving trends in the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic) could not be accounted for.Second, there were limited data for some comparisons and questions of interest such as IL-6 antagonists vs corticosteroids and the effect of siltuximab.
