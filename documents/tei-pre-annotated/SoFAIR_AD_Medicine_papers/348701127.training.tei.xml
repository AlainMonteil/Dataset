        <p>Inflammation, organ injury and death due to viral infection can occur as a result of direct viral cytotoxicity, collateral damage from an appropriate pathogen-driven immune response, or an aberrant response precipitated by the pathogen, causing immunopathology (1). Resilience to infectious disease is frequently thought of as best achieved through resistance (controlling pathogen load to prevent organ injury) but the emerging concept of tolerance (preventing organ injury and inflammation despite the presence of pathogen) is equally valid (2). In this context tolerance could involve restricting the production of injurious inflammatory effectors or moderating pro-and anti-inflammatory signalling downstream of pathogen sensing, to reduce immunopathology (3,4).Inflammation, organ injury and death due to viral infection can occur as a result of direct viral cytotoxicity, collateral damage from an appropriate pathogen-driven immune response, or an aberrant response precipitated by the pathogen, causing immunopathology (1).

        <p>Hyper-inflammation is a recognised component of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), and associates with organ dysfunction, disease severity and death (5)(6)(7). Fatal COVID-19 most often occurs with critical impairment of oxygenation and treatment with corticosteroids has been robustly demonstrated to reduce mortality in these circumstances (8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13). This suggests that pulmonary inflammation has a causal role in death, but it remains unknown whether this inflammation is a direct response to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or an independent immunopathologic process. Human immunology studies focusing on peripheral blood (7,14) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (15) are revealing fundamental changes during COVID-19, but these approaches risk underestimating the immune changes within actual pulmonary tissue and so immunophenotyping at a whole lung level in severe COVID-19 is essential. While COVID-19 is principally thought of as a pulmonary disease, increasing evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 also has extra-pulmonary tissue tropism (16) and dysfunction of multiple organs occurs in COVID-19 (17). The relationship between presence of virus, evidence of organ injury and the associated immune response at a tissue and cellular level remains poorly defined.Hyper-inflammation is a recognised component of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19), and associates with organ dysfunction, disease severity and death (5)(6)(7).

        <p>Post-mortem examinations were conducted in a biosafety level three (BSL3) postmortem facility on patients with pre-mortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence of lower respiratory tract disease at a median of 19•3 hours after death (interquartile range 4•6-20•2). 37 tissue sites were systematically sampled, following a standardised protocol, for histology and RNA analyses including 23 from the respiratory tract (Figure E1). Samples were fixed in formalin or treated with TRIzol, snap frozen and stored at -80C. Ethical approval was granted by the East of Scotland Research Ethics Service (16/ES/0084).

Slides were reviewed by a group of specialist histopathologists who scored inflammation semi-quantitatively (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3). For immunophenotyping, multiplexed immunofluorescence on de-paraffinised rehydrated FFPE slides was performed using combinations of primary antibodies against CD34, CD68, MRP8, CD4, CD8 and CD20, labelled with TSAconjugated fluorophores, with antibody removal between steps.

        <p>To create a detailed tissue atlas of fatal COVID-19 we sampled 37 distinct anatomical tissue sites at autopsy to identify viral RNA distribution and host immune responses (Figure E1). We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA across all sampled organs and tissue sites, most frequently in the respiratory tract but also from the gastrointestinal tract, heart and muscle, and less often from the liver, kidney and other organs (Figure 1 A,B). Despite all sampled organs having the potential to contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we observed substantial inter-patient variation in the tissue sites involved (Figure 1B). The time from illness onset to death did not correlate with the number of PCR-positive organs (Figure 1B; Figure E3). Results from multiplex PCR were confirmed to map to the SARS-CoV-2 genome by sequencing (Figure 1 C,D) significantly increasing confidence in these data compared with a PCR-only approach. Viral subgenomic messenger RNA (most commonly from the nucleocapsid gene) was also detected from PCR-positive sites, indicating active viral RNA synthesis had occurred (Figure E4).To create a detailed tissue atlas of fatal COVID-19 we sampled 37 distinct anatomical tissue sites at autopsy to identify viral RNA distribution and host immune responses (Figure E1).

        <p>As analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA confirmed presence in numerous organs, detailed tissue analysis was undertaken on every patient to determine the associated pathological consequences and immune responses. In contrast to the distribution of viral RNA, this analysis indicated that the lung and reticulo-endothelial system were the exclusive sites of an extensive inflammatory response (Figure 1A). Extra-pulmonary sites with virus present, and evidence of viral transcription, did not have substantial local inflammation.As analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA confirmed presence in numerous organs, detailed tissue analysis was undertaken on every patient to determine the associated pathological consequences and immune responses.

        <p>To better resolve this organ-specific pathogen-host interaction at a spatial and cellular level, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was evaluated on randomly selected SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tissues. Consistent with the latest reports on tissue expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (20), S protein was found predominantly within epithelia of the aero-respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, with limited presence within macrophages (CD68 + cells) and endothelial cells (CD105 + cells) of lung tissue (Figure 1 E-F). The S protein was only rarely detected in some of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative tissues tested, and not in post-mortem tissues from patients who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection (data not shown). While SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression within lung alveolar epithelial cells was patchy in nature, consistent with possible aspiration or inhalation of virus from the upper respiratory tract (21), expression at non-pulmonary sites frequently revealed several well demarcated areas of confluent SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression within adjacent cells, surrounded by cells with no detectable protein (Figure 1 E). These 'foci of infection', with numerous affected cells adjacent to unaffected cells, are suggestive of cell-to-cell spread as reported in other coronavirus and respiratory viruses (22,23).To better resolve this organ-specific pathogen-host interaction at a spatial and cellular level, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was evaluated on randomly selected SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive tissues.

        <p>Overall, we observed minimal evidence of acute inflammation in other organs (Figure 1 A). Background changes of chronic disease were common, reflecting pre-existing comorbidities. Expected organ injury commensurate with severity of systemic illness was also present (e.g. renal acute tubular necrosis in mechanically ventilated patients, Table E3). Detectable viral RNA in the kidney (n=4 detectable), liver (n=4) and gastrointestinal tract (n=7) was not associated with inflammation scores or with biochemical evidence of acute kidney injury, peak ALT measurement or enteric symptoms, respectively (Figure E5). No acute tissue abnormalities were identified in the gastrointestinal tract or endocrine organs and no cases of myocarditis were identified despite frequent detection of viral RNA within these tissues (Table E3).Overall, we observed minimal evidence of acute inflammation in other organs (Figure 1 A).

        <p>Pulmonary tissue was highly abnormal, with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD, the pathological hallmark of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; ARDS), thrombosis and bronchopneumonia frequent but variable findings (Figure 2A). Unexpectedly, the geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence within the lung was not linearly associated with pulmonary inflammatory changes within our cohort as DAD and bronchopneumonia were both observed in sections of lung with and without detectable virus. In one patient (Patient I) virus could be detected in the absence of significant pulmonary inflammation. These findings strongly suggest that virusindependent immunopathology, rather than direct viral cytotoxicity, is one of the primary mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19.Pulmonary tissue was highly abnormal, with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD, the pathological hallmark of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; ARDS), thrombosis and bronchopneumonia frequent but variable findings (Figure 2A).

        <p>Consistent with recent reports, pulmonary thrombi were present in multiple patients (8/11; small vessel only n=1, large vessel only n=2, large and small vessel n=5) (Figure 2A). A patchy but striking mononuclear cell vasculitis predominantly affecting intima of small/medium sized pulmonary arteries was also observed in 4/11 cases (Figure 2B). This pulmonary artery immune infiltrate was further characterised in two patients (A&amp;C) by multiplex immunofluorescence (Figure 2 C,D).

        <p>Increased CD8 + T cells and reduced resident lung macrophages have recently been reported using single cell transcriptomics on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells (15). However, this approach risks underestimating pathophysiological and immune changes within the non-luminal pulmonary compartment. To understand the immune response at a whole lung level multiplex immunophenotyping was undertaken on pulmonary tissue (Figure 3 A-G; Figure E7). Our analysis revealed that the greatest increase in immune cells were predominantly within parenchymal regions rather than vascular/perivascular areas (Figure 3F-G). This showed that the largest relative increases were within the mononuclear phagocyte compartment (CD68 + /MRP8 - macrophages, then CD68 + /MRP8 + monocytic cells) followed by CD8 + then CD4 + T cells. Smaller increases in CD20 + cells and MRP8 + /CD68 -cells were also observed.Increased CD8 + T cells and reduced resident lung macrophages have recently been reported using single cell transcriptomics on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells (15).

        <p>All cases showed a severe and stereotyped pattern of immunological changes regardless of viral RNA presence within the lymph node or spleen (Figure 3 H-J). Within the bone marrow, erythroid dysplasia, plasma cell excess with morphological atypia and iron storage abnormalities were identified (Figure 3H,I, Figure E8, Table E4). A marked increase in the number of plasma cells (5% or more) was seen in 5/8 bone marrow aspirates but these plasma cells had a normal phenotype on bone marrow trephines, being negative for CD56 and cyclin D1, and were polytypic with light chain immunohistochemistry (Figure E8).

        <p>The data presented in this manuscript have several implications for our understanding of severe COVID-19. Firstly, we show that fatal COVID-19 is associated with variable but widespread distribution of viral RNA and protein but with an unexpected discordant inflammatory response to local viral presence, both between and within tissues. If organ injury is primarily collateral damage to an appropriate local inflammatory response against SARS-CoV-2, it would be expected to have a temporal and spatial association with the presence of the virus. We have observed the opposite.The data presented in this manuscript have several implications for our understanding of severe COVID-19.

        <p>In some cases inflammation was present in sections of lung without detectable virus (and in patients who had not received invasive mechanical ventilation). This could relate to non-resolving inflammation after viral clearance, or inflammation in areas of lung where viral replication had never occurred; considering the sensitivity of PCR for viral detection, we contend the latter is possible. Conversely, even at the time of death, up to 42 days after illness onset, viral products (both RNA and protein) and evidence of viral RNA synthesis (subgenomic mRNA) could be detected in numerous tissues but dissociated from host inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the time from illness onset to death did not correlate with the number of PCR-positive organs. The presence of viral RNA within the kidney, intestine and liver was not associated with evidence of organ injury or inflammation. By spatially resolving viral presence we confirmed that in extra-pulmonary tissues, cells containing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein did not have an adjacent localised cellular immune response. These findings are consistent with strains of avian coronavirus which can replicate in the gut without causing macroscopic or histological changes (26). While lung tissue was frequently highly abnormal, to our surprise the geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence within the lung was not linearly associated with either the presence or nature of the lung inflammatory response. Within our cohort, we report both DAD and bronchopneumonia in sections of lung with and without detectable virus, as well as viral presence but without inflammation. Together, these observations on the immunopathology in relation to SARS-CoV-2 reveal an aberrant immune response, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, that is not clearly topologically associated with viral presence. This is clinically relevant: the evidence we present of virus-independent immunopathology being a primary mechanism underlying fatal COVID-19 supports the prioritisation of tolerance as a therapeutic strategy. This is consistent with the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in severe disease ( 13) and importantly provides a potential biological mechanistic basis for their efficacy, validating ongoing investigations of immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory drugs (27).In some cases inflammation was present in sections of lung without detectable virus (and in patients who had not received invasive mechanical ventilation).

        <p>Secondly, we expand upon the observation of increased CD8 + T cells and reduced resident lung macrophages in BALF (15), by describing a marked relative increase in immune cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and to a lesser extent CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, within the non-luminal pulmonary compartment. Macrophage abnormalities were also seen within bone marrow, with iron laden macrophages observed in all but one patient, despite the absence of typical causes of secondary iron overload (transfusion, haemolysis), and is consistent with the observation that circulating ferritin correlates with adverse outcomes (28). In human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infection, iron overload is associated with poor prognosis, with evidence that viral infection itself may enhance macrophage iron loading, further suggesting that iron overload is an aberrant macrophage response deleterious to the host in COVID-19 (29).Secondly, we expand upon the observation of increased CD8 + T cells and reduced resident lung macrophages in BALF (15), by describing a marked relative increase in immune cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage, and to a lesser extent CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, within the non-luminal pulmonary compartment.

        <p>Third, consistent with emerging literature, small and large pulmonary vessel thrombi were common in our series (30)(31)(32). Thrombi in pulmonary vessels have also been reported in fatal cases of SARS (24,33), influenza A virus infection (34,35), and ARDS more generally, but the frequency in COVID-19 appears nearly a log order higher compared to influenza and may be due to distinct endothelial injury pathways (30) but the drivers of this are unknown. Here we describe an immune cell pulmonary arteritis in nearly half of our cases, a novel pathological process in severe COVID-19 that may contribute to endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular thrombosis, and could represent a therapeutic target. Phenotyping of this pulmonary vasculitis revealed that the primary immune cells are not infiltrating T cells, in contrast to reports in fatal influenza (30), but MRP8 + mononuclear cells infiltrating into vessel walls. This COVID-19 vasculitis was not associated with local endothelial viral S protein expression although S protein was identified within a small number of CD105 + endothelial cells in other vessels within the lung. This observation validates the drive to understand the immune microenvironment at a whole lung level and is particularly interesting considering the identification of pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (15) and the recent report of C5aR1 + macrophages associated with obliterating arteritis in a COVID-19 autopsy sample, implicating mononuclear phagocyte activation and expansion as important pathologic processes in COVID-19 (36). Indeed, therapeutic targeting of the C5a axis has been proposed (37). The observation is also consistent with the finding that the myeloid growth factor GM-CSF and the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant MCP-1 are elevated in blood and associated with COVID-19 severity (38,39). Going forward, it will be important to clarify whether these macrophage abnormalities, within inflamed pulmonary vessels, lung parenchyma and reticulo-endothelial tissues, have an antiviral or tissue repair role, or whether being activated as part of the wider immune response to virus they are themselves promoting vascular and tissue injury. The implications for opposing strategies to either boost or inhibit macrophage function are obvious, and necessitate urgent further investigation.Third, consistent with emerging literature, small and large pulmonary vessel thrombi were common in our series (30)(31)(32).

        <p>Fourth, plasma cell abnormalities in the reticuloendothelial system and lung provided further evidence of an aberrant host response in fatal COVID-19. While plasma cell expansion is expected to ensure production of antibody in the context of acute infections, the levels seen in our study were extremely marked. Plasma cells exhibited morphologic atypia but displayed a reactive, polytypic phenotype. To some extent this correlates with peripheral blood findings in patients with COVID-19 where CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell depletion is characteristic but B-cell numbers are maintained, with higher B-cell numbers reported in severe cases (40,41). The plasma cells in our study were generally MUM1 + and CD38 + but CD138 (syndecan) low/negative raising the possibility that these are short-lived plasma cells or are at a transitional or arrested stage of development (42). In addition to macrophage behaviour and iron accumulation, this identifies plasma cells as a priority for future investigation of therapeutic targets. This report has several limitations. We did not recruit non-COVID-19 patients into our cohort as this work was conducted as an urgent investigation into COVID-19, rather than to describe how COVID-19 differs from any other specific pulmonary/systemic disease or infection. Indeed, any immuno-pathological changes in COVID-19 that are shared with other causes of severe pulmonary injury/inflammation may still be avenues for therapeutic intervention. Reports of histological findings in fatal influenza provide some comparison as discussed above in the context of thrombosis, but we are unaware of a similar depth of pulmonary parenchymal immunophenotyping being reported.Fourth, plasma cell abnormalities in the reticuloendothelial system and lung provided further evidence of an aberrant host response in fatal COVID-19.

        <p>The bone marrow B-cell and macrophage iron storage abnormalities reported here have not been observed in fatal influenza and may therefore be unique to 44). The patient cohort is heterogeneous, in particular with respect to age, receipt Primary antibody concentrations were optimized using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine chromogen-based staining, followed by single colour immunofluorescence with one fluorophore to assess the relative intensities of the markers. All markers were then allocated a fluorophore according to intensity to achieve a balanced intensity over all the fluorophores. The antibodies and concentrations used are shown in Table S6. Assessment of inflammatory cell infiltration into vessel walls was performed in 50 arterial profiles from two patients with approximately 900 cells phenotyped. Archived uninflamed lung tissue was obtained from background lung tissue taken at the time of lung cancer resection through NHS Lothian BioResource SR419.The bone marrow B-cell and macrophage iron storage abnormalities reported here have not been observed in fatal influenza and may therefore be unique to 44).

Directly following extraction, samples were DNase treated using TURBO™ DNase (Thermofisher) as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and quality were assessed using a Nanodrop One spectrophotometer (Thermofisher). RNA reverse transcription and PCR steps were carried out essentially as described in the protocol published by the ARTIC Network (2). Reverse transcription used SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to generate single strand cDNA using a random primer mix (NEB, a mixture of random hexamers and anchored dT primer). The ARTIC primer set multiplex (v3), made up of 98 primer pairs, was used to create tiled PCR amplicons across the SARS-CoV-2 viral cDNA. Reaction conditions were: denaturation at 98C for 30 sec followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec denaturation at 98C; 5 min annealing and extension at 65C; final hold at 4C. Agarose gel analysis (1.5% gel, 1x TBE, 1x SYBR Safe DNA stain, run for 30 min at 110 V) was performed for verification of PCR products (ARTIC primers approximately 400bp) for every sample and each multiplex pool.

        <p>The PCR products from pool 1 and pool 2 ARTIC multiplex reactions for each sample were pooled and purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Quantification of the amplicon pools before normalization was performed using a Qubit 4 fluorometer (Thermofisher). 50 ng of purified PCR product was end-prepared with Ultra II End repair/dA-tailing Module (NEB) and incubated at 20C for 5 mins then 65C for 5 mins. Nanopore native barcodes (EXP-NBD104/114) were ligated to end-prepared DNA using Ultra II Ligation Module (NEB) and incubated at 20C for 20 mins then 65C for 10 mins. Up to 24 barcoded samples were pooled and purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Sequencing adapters were ligated to the barcoded library using the Quick Ligation Module (NEB) and incubated at room temperature for 20 mins. The sequencing library was purified once more with AMPure XP beads, eluted and loaded on a FLO-MIN106D flow cell for sequencing using Oxford Nanopore MinION or GridION based platforms. Minimap2 was used to align fastq sequences to the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using the -ax map-ont parameters. Samtools was used to sort and index 
            <rs type="software">alignment</rs> files, and Picard was used to mark 
            <rs type="software">duplicates</rs>. A custom script written in perl, was used to determine viral genome coverage which was then visualised in RStudio. Genome coverage for every PCR-positive sample is shown in Fig. S4.

        <p>Negative technical (no primary antibody) and biological (SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative tissue) controls were included and tested. Isotype control showed complete negativity (Figure E9). A number of different SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies were validated in house. Biological negative and positive control tissues, utilised for the antibody validation, were archival pre-Covid-19 autopsy lung tissue and current Covid19 PCR positive tissue, respectively. Moreover, a VERO cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (and uninfected control) were utilised to further validate the antibodies. For multiplexed immunofluorescence, primary antibodies used are listed in Table S6. Multiplexed scanned (whole slide imaging) images were imported into QuPath v0.2.0 (4). Individual cells were detected by the cell detection tool in QuPath using the hoechst channel. Single measurement classifiers were utilized to sub-classify AE1/3 + , CD105 + and CD68 + cells by the intensity of FITC, Cy3 and AF750 channels, respectively. In addition, S protein measurement classifier was set to distinguish its positivity in the Cy5 channel which was corroborated with IHC and subsequent negative controls. These single measurement classifiers were then combined into a composite classifier which measured the number of cells coexpressing AE1/3 and S protein, CD105 and S protein, and CD68 and S protein. Radiographic investigations and reports from all cases were reviewed by a multi-disciplinary team comprising thoracic radiologists, respiratory clinicians and specialist thoracic pathologists. Imaging was scored by a thoracic radiologist based on the presence (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) or absence (0) of relevant features. When cross-sectional imaging had not been performed during or shortly before the acute episode, any previous imaging was reviewed to identify pre-existing features such as emphysema, bronchiectasis, fibrosis or coronary artery calcification. Plain chest radiographs were available for all patients, demonstrating bilateral, peripheral, patchy consolidation or ground glass opacification of varying severity. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed in five cases. In mechanically ventilated (MV) patients, features consistent with ARDS were apparent in addition to new cystic changes (cases A and B) and prominent basal bronchi with varicosities and traction (traction bronchiectasis), likely secondary to extensive consolidation but potentially due to the development of early fibrotic change (cases A, B, D). Pleural effusions, a less common radiologic feature of Covid-19 (5), were identified in 5/11 cases.

        <p>Patients with pre-mortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence of lower respiratory tract disease, who were considered to be approaching the end of life, were referred to the research team by their responsible clinician. After death, authorization for a hospital post-mortem and collection of tissues and data for research was requested from the decedent's nearest relative. Royal College of Pathologists guidance on COVID-19 autopsies were followed (1). All staff wore personal protective equipment including FFP3 respirators and all post-mortem examinations were conducted within a highrisk facility. Representative samples were collected systematically, following a standardized sampling and fixation protocol, from the vitreous, blood, posterior nasal mucosa, posterior base of tongue, tonsil, thyroid, trachea (upper and lower), bronchi (right and left main), sub-carinal/peri-hilar mediastinal lymph nodes, lung (all five lobes), heart (right and left ventricle), liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, adrenal, stomach, jejunum, ileum, colon (ascending and descending) and muscle (quadriceps, diaphragm and intercostal) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Bone marrow aspirate (1ml) and trephine were taken from the anterior aspect of the right ribs. Brain tissue was not sampled due to local health and safety arrangements.Patients with pre-mortem PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and evidence of lower respiratory tract disease, who were considered to be approaching the end of life, were referred to the research team by their responsible clinician.

        <p>Sample processing followed a standardised pipeline in the hospital diagnostic pathology laboratory (2). Following haematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue, additional special stains and immunohistochemistry were performed as required for clinical diagnostics. Bone marrow trephine samples were decalcified in EDTA prior to processing. Bone marrow aspirates were collected in EDTA then smear and squash preparations were prepared, fixed and stained with Wright-Giemsa and Perl's. Bone marrow cellularity was assessed at 10x power and morphological assessment was performed at 50x. A minimum of 1000 nucleated cells were counted to assess hematopoietic activity, proportions of cell lineages, morphology and iron storage. Organ histology was reviewed by a group of expert organspecific histopathologists (WAW, DAD, COCB, WAQ, AO, MS, DNP, DKW). Formal reports were written for each case and subsequently semi-quantitatively scored based on the degree of acute organ injury and inflammation (for each: none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3) and absence or presence (a or b respectively) of pre-existing chronic change. Acute lung injury scoring incorporated features of diffuse alveolar damage and bronchopneumonia. Other organs were scored for features of acute necroinflammatory injury while spleen and lymph node scores were based on the extent of aberrant morphological features.Sample processing followed a standardised pipeline in the hospital diagnostic pathology laboratory (2).

        <p>FFPE slides were de-paraffinized and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% H 2 O 2 for 30 mins. Antigen retrieval was performed in a decloaking chamber (BioCare) at 110ºC for 30 mins in EDTA (0.175mM pH 8) followed by cooling and rinsing with water then PBS. Slides were then incubated with the primary antibody at indicated concentrations (Supplementary Table 5) for 30 mins at room temperature (or overnight at 4ºC for CD68), followed by Opal polymer HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 mins, then with the chosen Opal (Akoya) fluorophore (1:100) for 10 mins. Each step was followed by washes with PBS. Microwave treatment in EDTA (0.175mM), for 15 mins once boiling, was used for antibody removal between steps and this was repeated as required for multiplex staining. Slides were then incubated in DAPI for 5 mins at room temperature, rinsed with PBS and water, then mounted with ProLong TM Diamond (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Vectra Polaris slide scanner (Akoya Biociences). A whole slide scan at x20 resolution was used to select regions of interest for multi-spectral scanning, with an average of 40 fields (931x698m) per section (40x resolution using objective 0.75NA at 2x2 binning). Single colour staining done in parallel with the experiment was used to build a specific spectral library (Supplementary Fig. 5) allowing optimum spectral un-mixing of the fluorophores and Supplementary FiguresFFPE slides were de-paraffinized and rehydrated.
