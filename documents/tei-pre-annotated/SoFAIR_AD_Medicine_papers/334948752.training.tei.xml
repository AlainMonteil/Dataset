        <p>Background There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or refusals due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues. Although immunisation coverage is reported administratively across the world, no similarly robust monitoring system exists for vaccine confidence. In this study, vaccine confidence was mapped across 149 countries between 2015 and 2019.Background There is growing evidence of vaccine delays or refusals due to a lack of trust in the importance, safety, or effectiveness of vaccines, alongside persisting access issues.

        <p>Methods In this large-scale retrospective data-driven analysis, we examined global trends in vaccine confidence using data from 290 surveys done between September, 2015, and December, 2019, across 149 countries, and including 284 381 individuals. We used a Bayesian multinomial logit Gaussian process model to produce estimates of public perceptions towards the safety, importance, and effectiveness of vaccines. Associations between vaccine uptake and a large range of putative drivers of uptake, including vaccine confidence, socioeconomic status, and sources of trust, were determined using univariate Bayesian logistic regressions. Gibbs sampling was used for Bayesian model inference, with 95% Bayesian highest posterior density intervals used to capture uncertainty.Methods In this large-scale retrospective data-driven analysis, we examined global trends in vaccine confidence using data from 290 surveys done between September, 2015, and December, 2019, across 149 countries, and including 284 381 individuals.

        <p>Findings Between November, 2015, and December, 2019, we estimate that confidence in the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines fell in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Korea. We found significant increases in respondents strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe between 2015 and 2019 in six countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Serbia. We find signs that confidence has improved between 2018 and 2019 in some EU member states, including Finland, France, Ireland, and Italy, with recent losses detected in Poland. Confidence in the importance of vaccines (rather than in their safety or effectiveness) had the strongest univariate association with vaccine uptake compared with other determinants considered. When a link was found between individuals' religious beliefs and uptake, findings indicated that minority religious groups tended to have lower probabilities of uptake.Findings Between November, 2015, and December, 2019, we estimate that confidence in the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines fell in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Korea.

        <p>Alongside persisting issues of access to health services, waning vaccine confidence has taken a toll on immu nisation programmes across the globe, [1][2][3][4] contributing to stag nating or decreasing immunisation rates and consequent surges in vaccinepreventable diseases such as measles. 5,6 In this context, WHO has named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019 alongside climate change. 7 Founded in 2010, the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP) was established to develop systematic approaches to monitoring public confidence in vaccines and to inform policy makers and stakeholders of the changing trends and determinants of vaccine confidence across the globe. Over the past decade, the VCP has compre hensively explored the landscape of confidence issues and experiences in managing confidence crises around the world. [8][9][10][11] The VCP has conducted numerous surveys, focus groups, indepth qualitative research, and large scale digital media analytics, [12][13][14] as well as convened expert roundtables and workshops to understand context specific attitudes to vaccines among the general public, 14,15 healthcare professionals and providers, 15 and pregnant women. 16 The VCP continues to research the roots, trends, and impacts of vaccine confidence issues at national and supranational levels to inform policy and trustbuilding activities and mitigate the need for crisis management in immunisation programmes.Alongside persisting issues of access to health services, waning vaccine confidence has taken a toll on immu nisation programmes across the globe, [1][2][3][4] contributing to stag nating or decreasing immunisation rates and consequent surges in vaccinepreventable diseases such as measles. 5,6 In this context, WHO has named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019 alongside climate change. 7 Founded in 2010, the Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP) was established to develop systematic approaches to monitoring public confidence in vaccines and to inform policy makers and stakeholders of the changing trends and determinants of vaccine confidence across the globe.

        <p>Among a multiplicity of factors influencing vaccine decisions, 17 key drivers of public confidence in vaccines were identified as trust in the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines, along with compatibility of vaccination with religious beliefs. 18 These findings have resulted in the development of a Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI) survey tool (first implemented in 2015 14 ) to measure individual perceptions on the safety, impor tance, effectiveness, and religious compatibility of vaccines. The VCI questionnaire has the primary focus of measuring confidence across multiple countries while being minimal, thus allowing ready integration into existing global surveys. The VCI survey is one of a diverse set of metrics and indices used to measure confidence or hesitancy such as the Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines Survey, which measures vaccine hesitancy among parents; 19 the Vaccination Confidence Scale, which measures confidence in adolescent vaccination; 20 the 5C scale (confidence, complacency, constraints, calcu lation, and collective responsibility), which iden tifies psychological barriers of vaccination behaviour; 21 and the SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, which has been deployed across multiple countries. [22][23][24][25][26] In this largescale retrospective study, we explore global trends in vaccine confidence between 2015 and 2019. We combine previously published data from nearly a quarter of a million individual survey responses with 50 000 add i tional interviews from 2019. To date, no comparable global estimates and monitoring of vaccine confidence are available, prohibiting a quantitative understanding of the relationship between vaccine coverage, socioeconomic demographics, and confidence. This ana lysis aims to provide multiyear globallevel estimates of vaccine confi dence for 149 countries worldwide, exploring trends in confidence and the global determinants of uptake including socioeconomic determinants and sources of trust.Among a multiplicity of factors influencing vaccine decisions, 17 key drivers of public confidence in vaccines were identified as trust in the importance, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines, along with compatibility of vaccination with religious beliefs. 18 These findings have resulted in the development of a Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI) survey tool (first implemented in 2015 14 ) to measure individual perceptions on the safety, impor tance, effectiveness, and religious compatibility of vaccines.

        <p>Evidence before this study We have previously done three systematic reviews identifying the key determinants of vaccine hesitancy to inform questionnaire design around vaccine confidence. Vaccine refusals and delays are contributing to an increasing number of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks (eg, measles and polio) globally. For this reason, vaccine hesitancy was named by WHO as one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019. Factors modulating vaccine confidence and, conversely, hesitancy include (but are not limited to) trust in health-care systems, providers, governance, information, and perceptions of vaccine importance, safety, and efficacy. The Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP) was founded 10 years ago to establish a systematic approach to monitoring public confidence in vaccines. In 2015, the VCP developed the Vaccine Confidence Index (VCI) survey: a tool used to monitor spatiotemporal trends in vaccine confidence at national and global levels.Evidence before this study We have previously done three systematic reviews identifying the key determinants of vaccine hesitancy to inform questionnaire design around vaccine confidence.

        <p>We used new and existing VCI surveys comprising nearly 300 000 individual responses from 149 countries around the world, allowing unprecedented insights into global timevarying trends in vaccine confidence. Datasets previously collected in collaboration with ORB International (Gallup International), the European Commission, and the Philippines Survey and Research Centre were used alongside novel data from the Sahel and worldwide data collected up to the end of 2019. We used Bayesian tools to estimate national-level vaccine confidence trends and to investigate the link in each country between vaccine uptake and socioeconomic and non-socioeconomic (eg, confidence in vaccine, trust in health system) determinants. To our knowledge, this is the largest study of global vaccine confidence to date, using a common metric to allow cross-country comparisons of vaccine sentiment globally.We used new and existing VCI surveys comprising nearly 300 000 individual responses from 149 countries around the world, allowing unprecedented insights into global timevarying trends in vaccine confidence.

        <p>This study provides novel insights into worldwide variations in vaccine confidence and presents the country-dependent factors that modulate vaccine decisions. These include perceptions of vaccine safety, efficacy, and importance; socioeconomic and demographic determinants; and individually reported levels of trust. The study findings are discussed in light of past and ongoing vaccine confidence issues in different settings. A key implication of this analysis is the importance of regular monitoring of vaccine confidence levels to detect trends and changes that suggest the need for interventions to sustain confidence and pre-empt negative impacts on vaccination uptake.This study provides novel insights into worldwide variations in vaccine confidence and presents the country-dependent factors that modulate vaccine decisions.

Responses to the three statements were answered on Likert scales ranging from "strongly dis agree" to "strongly agree". Likert responses presented to respondents differed between surveys (appendix 1 p 4); however, the outer most categories ("strongly agree" and "strongly disagree") remained consistent across surveys. Thus, to allow meaningful comparisons in trends between surveys, individual survey responses falling between "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree" were recoded into the new category "neither strongly agree nor strongly disagree", with the "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree" responses remaining unchanged. This reclas sification assumes that respondents who report the most confident ("strongly agree") and least confident ("strongly disagree") beliefs are unlikely to change their response regardless of whether they are presented with additional Likert categories such as "tend to agree", "somewhat agree", or "neither agree nor disagree" (or a combination thereof; appendix 1 p 4).For the WHO regional groupings see https://www. who.int/about/who-we-are/ regional-offices methodologies).

Indonesia also witnessed large drops in confidence over this time in all three elements: vaccine safety (absolute difference 13•8%, 9•0-18•9), importance (14•6%, 9•9-19•5), and effective ness (12•2%, 7•5-17•7; figure 2). Vaccine confidence increased between 2015 and 2019 across all three elements for France, India, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and Thailand (figure 2). Timeseries trends in vaccine confidence until the end of 2019 are shown for the EU (including the UK) and the Philippines (figure 3). Recent losses in the percentage of respondents agreeing that vaccines are safe (between 2018 and late 2019) are detected in Poland, with increases detected in Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, and the UK (figure 3A; appendix 2). Vaccine confidence plummeted between 2015 to 2018 in the Philippines (over well documented fears around the Dengvaxia vaccine in 2017 27,32,33 ); however, since the start of 2018, confidence in the importance of vaccines has made substantial gains, with less substantial increases in vaccine safety and effectiveness perceptions (figure 3B). The loss of vaccine confidence in the Philippines triggered by fears over Dengvaxia appears to also have affected uptake of routine vaccines recom mended by the national immuni sation programme (figure 3C). 27 This pattern is not limited to the Philippines: there were larger increases in the percentage of respondents perceiving vaccines to be important than safe or effective across the majority of countries in the European region for which there was an improvement in recorded importance confidence (figure 2).Reduced uptake Improved uptake of confidence in Indonesia, the Philippines, Pakistan, and South Korea, and for two elements in Afghanistan and Vietnam (figure 2).

        <p>Significant associations between uptake and vaccine confidence, sources of trust, informationseeking behav iour, and demographics and socioeconomic status are shown in figure 4, with consistent trends shown across the globe. Overall, the deter minants most consistently associated with improved uptake were high confidence in vaccines (66 countries); trusting healthcare workers more than family, friends, or other nonmedical sources for medical and health advice (43 countries); higher levels of science education (35 countries); sex, with women more likely than men to report any child having at least one vaccine in 41 countries and men more likely than women in just one country (Chad); age (younger age groups associated with increased chances of uptake in 43 countries); and high informationseeking behaviour (18 countries). Income and religion were less widely associated with uptake; however, when a link was found between religion and uptake, it is the minority religious groups (or those refusing to provide their religious belief) who were associated with lower probability of uptake (figure 4).Significant associations between uptake and vaccine confidence, sources of trust, informationseeking behav iour, and demographics and socioeconomic status are shown in figure 4, with consistent trends shown across the globe.

        <p>To our knowledge, this is the largest study of vaccine confidence, offering important insights into the global state of vaccine confidence. Vaccine confidence was esti mated and mapped for 149 countries from 2015 to 2019, revealing key spatial and temporal trends. Although confidence remained low across Europe compared with other continents, there are signs that vaccine confidence is increasing for much of Europe, including France, where vaccine confidence has been persistently low since 2015. Confidence increased overall in Poland between 2015 and 2019, but a recent loss in confidence was seen between late 2018 and late 2019, reflecting the growing impact of a highly organised local antivaccine movement. 34 Between 2015 and 2018, vaccine confidence plum meted in the Philippines and Indonesia. In 2017, the vaccine manu facturer Sanofi announced that their newly introduced dengue vaccine Dengvaxia posed a risk to individuals who had not previously been exposed to the virus, prompting outrage and panic across the population where nearly 850 000 children had been given the new vaccine the previous year. As the VCP measured a baseline confidence value in 2015, we were able to measure the change in confidence following the vaccine scare and found a significant drop in confidence in vaccine importance, safety, effectiveness. 27 The VCI survey tool has detected a rise in confidence across the country-although con fidence is not back to 2015 levels-indicating a possible recovery and highlighting the value of the tool in assessing the effectiveness of nationallevel policy.To our knowledge, this is the largest study of vaccine confidence, offering important insights into the global state of vaccine confidence.

        <p>Japan ranked among the countries with the lowest vaccine confidence in the world: this might be linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety scares that started in 2013, and following the decision by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in June, 2013, to suspend proactive recommendation of the HPV vaccine. 35 As a result of this vaccine safety scare, HPV vaccination coverage decreased from 68•4-74•0% in the 1994-98 birth cohort to 0•6% in the 2000 birth cohort. 36 The news of Japan suspending their proactive recommendation of the HPV vaccine has travelled globally through online media and social media networks, being applauded by anti vaccination groups but not by the global scientific community. 4 The way in which the HPV vaccine scare was approached by health ofcials, as well as an ongoing outbreak of rubella in Japan, 37,38 indicate continuing issues with the Japanese vaccination pro gramme that need resolving. 39 Indonesia witnessed a large drop in confidence between 2015 and 2019, partly triggered by Muslim leaders questioning the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and ultimately issuing a fatwa-a religious ruling-claiming that the vaccine was haram and contained ingredients derived from pigs and thus not acceptable for Muslims. Local healers promoting natural alternatives to vaccines also contributed to the waning confidence in vaccines. 40,41 Results from our survey can inform the need for further research, to explore why certain countries might expe rience sudden increases or decreases in confidence. We have highlighted countries with marked decreases in percentages reporting that they strongly agree that vaccines are safe and countries with significant increases in those strongly disagreeing that vaccines are safe. These countries are candidates for more nuanced followup surveys to understand the precise drivers of confidence and the link between confidence and uptake.Japan ranked among the countries with the lowest vaccine confidence in the world: this might be linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety scares that started in 2013, and following the decision by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in June, 2013, to suspend proactive recommendation of the HPV vaccine. 35 As a result of this vaccine safety scare, HPV vaccination coverage decreased from 68•4-74•0% in the 1994-98 birth cohort to 0•6% in the 2000 birth cohort. 36 The news of Japan suspending their proactive recommendation of the HPV vaccine has travelled globally through online media and social media networks, being applauded by anti vaccination groups but not by the global scientific community. 4 The way in which the HPV vaccine scare was approached by health ofcials, as well as an ongoing outbreak of rubella in Japan, 37,38 indicate continuing issues with the Japanese vaccination pro gramme that need resolving. 39 Indonesia witnessed a large drop in confidence between 2015 and 2019, partly triggered by Muslim leaders questioning the safety of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and ultimately issuing a fatwa-a religious ruling-claiming that the vaccine was haram and contained ingredients derived from pigs and thus not acceptable for Muslims.

        <p>In South Korea and Malaysia, online mobilisation against vaccines has been identified as a key barrier to vaccination. 42,43 The internet is a main source of vacci nation information in Malaysia, where misinformation has been identified as influencing vaccine reluctance. 44 In South Korea, an online community named ANAKI (Korean abbreviation of "raising children without medi cation") has been strongly advocating against childhood immunisation. 45 Future studies in both countries should further investigate this trend and propose mitigation strategies. In Georgia, unfounded vaccine safety concerns, amplified by the media, were found to profoundly affect a nationwide MMR vaccine campaign in 2008. 46 Our findings of low vaccine confidence in Georgia could suggest that concerns about vaccine safety are again on the rise.In South Korea and Malaysia, online mobilisation against vaccines has been identified as a key barrier to vaccination. 42,43 The internet is a main source of vacci nation information in Malaysia, where misinformation has been identified as influencing vaccine reluctance. 44 In South Korea, an online community named ANAKI (Korean abbreviation of "raising children without medi cation") has been strongly advocating against childhood immunisation. 45 Future studies in both countries should further investigate this trend and propose mitigation strategies.

        <p>The determinants of vaccine uptake across the globe show strong consistency, with being male or having fewer years of education associated with decreased chances of uptake. Positive informationseeking behav iours and trusting healthcare workers more than other sources such as one's social circle for medical and health advice were associated with increased chances of uptake.The determinants of vaccine uptake across the globe show strong consistency, with being male or having fewer years of education associated with decreased chances of uptake.

        <p>There are several study limitations to note. First, as not all surveys used have consistent responses, we have made a key assumption that, presented with different options between the extreme categories of "strongly agree" and "strongly disagree" (which are consistent across all surveys), respondents with the strongest sentiment will fall into one of these extreme groups regardless of additional categories. While this approach probably allows meaningful comparison across sur veys-although it needs testing for validation-it pools vacci nation beliefs among those without the strongest beliefs, masking potentially key information. Second, the WGM survey data only permit an investigation of uptake defined as whether a parent has had any of their children vaccinated against at least one childhood disease. These uptake data are therefore not defined on a vaccine or childbychild basis, precluding an investigation of determinants of vaccinespecific or childspecific uptake (which has been done recently in the literature 22,24,41 ). Moreover, we rely on parental recall being accurate, and patterns of recall error not varying substantially across countries. Finally, owing to low case counts of respon dents who have not had their children vaccinated (appendix 2) and the varying religious groups across countries, religious groups were recoded into the largest and minority groups to extract results from our regres sion analysis. In many settings, more nuanced regression findings are possible, and a compre hensive regression analysis could reveal more informative countryspecific determinants of vaccine uptake.There are several study limitations to note.
