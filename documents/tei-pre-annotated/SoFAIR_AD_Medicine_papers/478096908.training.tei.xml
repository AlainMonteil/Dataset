        <p>The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a global health concern. The mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine had a reported efficacy of 94.1% at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 due to infection with "wild-type" variants in a randomized clinical trial. Here, we assess the realworld effectiveness of this vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, specifically B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.351 (Beta), in Qatar, which is a population that comprises mainly working-age adults, using a matched test-negative, case-control study design. We show that vaccine effectiveness was negligible for two weeks after the first dose, but increased rapidly in the third and fourth weeks, immediately prior to administration of a second dose. Effectiveness against B.1.1.7 infection was 88.1% (95% CI: 83.7-91.5%) ≥14 days after the first dose but before the second dose, and was 100% (95% CI: 91.8-100.0%) ≥14 days after the second dose. Analogous effectiveness against B.1.351 infection was 61.3% after the first dose (95% CI: 56.5-65.5%) and 96.4% after the second dose (95% CI: 91.9-98.7%). Effectiveness against any severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease due to any SARS-CoV-2 infection (predominantly B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) was 81.6% (95% CI: 71.0-88.8%) and 95.7% (95% CI: 73.4-99.9%), after the first and second doses, respectively. The mRNA-1273 vaccine is highly effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and any COVID-19 hospitalization and death, even after a single dose.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to be a global health concern.

        <p>In a randomized clinical trial, the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine had a reported efficacy of 94.1% at preventing symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with "wild-type" variants 1 . The first immunization using this vaccine in Qatar was recorded on December 28, 2020, but mass vaccination did not start until late February, 2021 with the accelerated arrival of vaccine shipments. As the vaccination campaign was scaled up, the country experienced two, back-to-back severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) waves that were triggered by introduction and expansion of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha 2 ) and B.1.351 (Beta 2 ) variants 3 . This created a unique epidemiological opportunity to assess real-world effectiveness of this vaccine against infection with these variants of concern, as well as against severe forms of COVID-19 disease.In a randomized clinical trial, the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine had a reported efficacy of 94.1% at preventing symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to infection with "wild-type" variants 1 .

        <p>Our analysis demonstrates that vaccine effectiveness of mRNA-1273 was high regardless of variant, against both symptomatic infection and asymptomatic infection, and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Development of vaccine protection against B.1.1.7 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization and death rapidly accelerated in the third and fourth weeks after the first dose, immediately before the second dose, nearly reaching the values attained after the second dose. Protection against B.1.351 infection exhibited a similar pattern, but mounted at a slower rate and did not achieve its highest value of ~95% until after the second dose. While longterm protection of only one dose could not be assessed beyond four weeks after the first dose, these findings might suggest that most of the protection of this vaccine is attained using only one dose, apart possibly from its protection against B.1.351. Although for optimal protection the protocol for this vaccine requires a second dose 28 days after the first, given the sizable protection achieved after only one dose, in situations involving limited vaccine supplies, these findings may support a strategy of delaying the second dose in order to vaccinate the largest number of people in the shortest time, as supported also by evidence for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222; Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines [9][10][11] . Having said so, the optimal timing of the second dose is best determined formally through randomized clinical trials and could also depend on both the incidence level and circulating variants, which are factors that can vary from one setting to another.Our analysis demonstrates that vaccine effectiveness of mRNA-1273 was high regardless of variant, against both symptomatic infection and asymptomatic infection, and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death.

        <p>The mRNA-1273 vaccine demonstrated similar levels and patterns of protection after the first and second doses to the BNT162b2 vaccine, as estimated recently in Qatar 3,11 . However, in our study, the mRNA-1273 vaccine appears to offer greater protection against both B.1.351 and B.1.1.7. It is premature to conclude that this outcome is due to a superior vaccine-induced immune response, as other confounding variables may also have contributed to observed differences. The second dose of mRNA-1273 is administered 28 days after the first dose, one week later than for BNT162b2, which might have affected the build-up of immunity and estimated effectiveness. We also note that since the mass immunization campaigns in Qatar started with BNT162b2 in December of 2020, most older persons and those with comorbid conditions were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine before the mRNA-1273 vaccine became widely available in March to May of 2021. Those vaccinated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Table 1) tended to be slightly younger than those vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine 3 .The mRNA-1273 vaccine demonstrated similar levels and patterns of protection after the first and second doses to the BNT162b2 vaccine, as estimated recently in Qatar 3,11 .

        <p>Effectiveness in our study was assessed based on documented infections, but other infections might have occurred and gone undocumented, perhaps because of minimal and/or mild symptoms, or by virtue of being subclinical infections. However, with the high rate of PCR testing in Qatar, 64.2% of infections that were diagnosed during the study period were identified not because of clinical symptoms, but for other reasons, including random testing campaigns (surveys), contact tracing, individual requests, and routine healthcare and travel-related testing. This indicates that the vaccine was robustly effective not only against symptomatic clinical disease, but also against asymptomatic and subclinical infection. That said, there was evidence for a slight gradient in vaccine effectiveness by appearance of symptoms, that is greater protection against more symptomatic or severe infections, as observed for the BNT162b2 vaccine 3,11 .Effectiveness in our study was assessed based on documented infections, but other infections might have occurred and gone undocumented, perhaps because of minimal and/or mild symptoms, or by virtue of being subclinical infections.

        <p>This study has some limitations. Estimated effectiveness against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease had somewhat wider 95% confidence intervals, as a consequence of the relatively lower severity of COVID-19 in the young population of Qatar compared to populations where the median age is higher 4,12 , the younger cohort of those vaccinated with mRNA-1273, and that the majority of vaccinated persons had their second dose after each of the B. Severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 disease was assessed up to end of study (May 10, 2021), and it is possible that cases confirmed as PCR positive right before end of the study may have progressed to a severe outcome only after end of the study, and were thus not included in our sample. This, however, should not affect our estimates, as the study, by design, contrasts confirmed COVID-19 disease cases to PCR-negative cases. For reasons that remain unclear, among persons 7-13 days after the first dose, risk of infection with B.1.351 was higher compared to those who remained unvaccinated, an outcome observed elsewhere for both COVID-19 vaccines [13][14][15] and other vaccines 16 . This might reflect a higher underlying risk of infection, bias due to uncontrolled confounding such as differences in social behavior at or following vaccination, an immunological effect 16 , or an artifact of the estimation method, possibly because the first vaccine dose coincided often with the peak of the B.1.351 wave.This study has some limitations.

        <p>The baseline analysis did not factor matching or control for calendar time, but sensitivity analyses factoring calendar time confirmed the main findings. Data on co-morbid conditions were not available and hence could not be factored explicitly in our analysis. However, adjusting for age may have served as a proxy given that co-morbidities are associated with old age. Furthermore, with the young population structure in Qatar 4,5 , we anticipate that only a small proportion of the study population may have had serious co-morbid conditions. However, our findings might not be entirely generalizable to other settings where the elderly population constitutes a sizable proportion of the population. Effectiveness was assessed using an observational test-negative case-control study design 17,18 , rather than a randomized clinical trial, but the cohort study design also yielded similar findings, supporting the validity of this approach in assessing vaccine effectiveness. In some instances, there were zero events among cases and/or controls thus precluding estimation of effectiveness and/or associated confidence interval.The baseline analysis did not factor matching or control for calendar time, but sensitivity analyses factoring calendar time confirmed the main findings.

        <p>In conclusion, the mRNA-1273 vaccine is very effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death in the population of Qatar. Most of the protection of this vaccine accrued in the third and fourth weeks after the first dose, and before the second dose, although its effectiveness against B.1.351 increased significantly more after the second dose. These findings justify optimism that vaccineinduced immunity will prove robust against known variants of concern, thereby reducing the likelihood of a protracted pandemic for years to come. * Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using the test-negative, case-control study design 17,18 .In conclusion, the mRNA-1273 vaccine is very effective against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, and against COVID-19 hospitalization and death in the population of Qatar.

        <p>This study was conducted in the resident population of Qatar. COVID-19 laboratory testing, vaccination, clinical infection data, and related demographic details were extracted from the integrated nationwide digital-health information platform that hosts the national, federated SARS-CoV-2 databases. These databases are complete and have captured all SARS-CoV-2related data since epidemic onset. Nearly all individuals were vaccinated (free of charge) in Qatar and not elsewhere. In rare situations where an individual received the mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine outside Qatar, the individual's vaccination details were still recorded in the health system at port of entry (airport) upon return to Qatar given the national requirements and to benefit from privileges associated with vaccination such as quarantine exemption.This study was conducted in the resident population of Qatar.
