        <p>Aim: Pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, smell, and taste dysfunctions could be the presenting symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The aim was to perform a systematic review of current evidences on clinical presentation of COVID-19, focusing on upper airway symptoms in order to help otolaryngologists identifying suspected cases. Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases. Results: We included 5 retrospective clinical studies for a total of 1556 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 57.5% were male and mean age was 49.1 years. Pooled data revealed that pharyngodynia was present in 12.4% of patients, nasal congestion in 3.7%, and rhinorrhea was rare. No reports on COVID-19 and olfactory/gustative disorders matched inclusion criteria but preliminary evidences suggested they could be present. Common symptoms were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent comorbidities were hypertension (17.4%), diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%); 83% of patients had alterations on chest computed tomography that were bilateral in 89.5% of cases. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (50%). Lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common. Critical cases with complications were 9%, intensive care unit admission was required in 7.3%, invasive ventilation in 3.4%, and mortality was 2.4%. Conclusion: Otolaryngologists should know that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, olfactory, and gustative disorders could be the presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Clinical presentation together with radiological and laboratory findings could help to identify suspected cases.Aim: Pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, smell, and taste dysfunctions could be the presenting symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

        <p>A novel member of human RNA coronavirus was newly identified in Wuhan, China. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 1 officially named it as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was established that the SARS-CoV-2 belonged to the b-coronavirus 2b lineage in the phylogenetic tree. By examining the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2, it was discovered that this novel virus shared 87.99% identity sequencing with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus, and it shared approximately 80% identity nucleotide with the original SARS epidemic virus. 2 Based on the preliminary information of this novel virus, it was considered that SARS-CoV-2 represented the third zoonotic human coronavirus of the century. 3 World Health Organization (WHO) recently named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical evidences have demonstrated that this virus was transmissible from person to person. 4 The transmission capacity was usually estimated using the so-called basic reproduction number or R0. Reliable estimates placed the R0 value of the COVID-19 in 1.4 to 2.5, similar to the R0 of the coronavirus SARS (SARV-CoV) at the beginning of the epidemic (2.2-3.7). The latter value was reduced to an R0 of 0.67 to 1.23 at the end of the SARS-CoV epidemic. By contrast, the coronavirus Middle-East respiratory syndrome has always remained at lower R0 values (0.29-0.80). 5 It seemed that the COVID-19 could be more easily transmitted than SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 cases increased rapidly in Wuhan and Hubei Province and they extended with transmission chains throughout China. Outside China, imported cases and secondary cases have been reported in many countries and territories, and WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 6 Studies have shown that COVID-19 could induce fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigue in infected patients. In more severe cases, infections caused viral pneumonia and could lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even death. 7 Pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea have been reported in patients with COVID-19. 8 Recently, the European Rhinology Society reported that ''a significant part of the COVID-19 patients (20-60%) appear to have loss of smell. Loss of smell can be the presenting symptom before other symptoms like coughing/fever occur.'' 9 Also Professor Claire Hopkins, the President of British Rhinological Society, said that ''There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that significant numbers of patients with proven COVID-19 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia''. 10 Consequently, an otolaryngologist could be the first to evaluate patients with COVID-19. Considering that the most likely route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is by contact and respiratory droplets (aerosols), over short distances (1.5 m), 2 ENT examination stands at high risk for transmission of the virus to health-care providers.A novel member of human RNA coronavirus was newly identified in Wuhan, China.

        <p>Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory secretions collected by nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. 11 High-false-negative rates (FNRs) have been reported for these tests. Results from RT-quantitative PCR could be affected by variations in viral RNA sequences or in viral loads in different anatomic sites during the disease natural history. 11 By estimate, FNR from one-time testing was 30% to 50% in real COVID-19 cases. 11 Considering 1014 COVID-19 cases, a recent report found that only 59% of patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs at presentation, while chest computed tomography (CT) had higher sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. 12 Clinical presentation is fundamental to identify suspected COVID-19 cases. To the best of our knowledge, no previous report focused on upper airway symptoms.Real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory secretions collected by nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. 11 High-false-negative rates (FNRs) have been reported for these tests.

        <p>Recently, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention published a large case series of COVID-19 in mainland China (72 314 cases, updated through February 11, 2020). 20 Among a total of 72 314 case records, 44 672 were classified as confirmed cases of COVID-19 (62%; diagnosis based on positive viral nucleic acid test result on throat swab samples), while others were suspected upon clinical characteristics. Most cases were classified as mild (81%; ie, nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia), and most common symptoms were cough and fever 20 but there was not a detailed description of other symptoms. Increasing number of reports claimed that negative nasal and oropharyngeal swab did not rule out COVID-19, and patients could transmit the infection. 11,12,21 Consequently, clinical presentation could be helpful to identify suspected cases. These patients should be isolated (use of individual rooms was recommended, with negative pressure if possible), and health personnel should use waterproof gowns, gloves, goggles, and surgical masks or FFP2 masks. 22,23 Pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and anosmia were reported as presenting symptoms of COVID-19.

        <p>We found that pharyngodynia was quite common between patients with COVID-19 (12.4%), while nasal congestion was not frequent (3.7%), and rhinorrhea was rare. The most common symptoms were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent associated chronic medical illness were hypertension (17.4%), diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%). A recent review and meta-analysis 24 confirmed that fever and cough were the most frequent symptoms but reported that sore throat was rare. The majority of included patients (48 981) in that review were extracted from studies that did not described accurately the clinical presentation of patients. [25][26][27] In the present investigation, we excluded those studies [25][26][27] because they were incomplete in symptom description and could confound the real clinical picture of COVID-19.

        <p>Our review considered only hospitalized patients and this could influence the percentage of complaints. As previously mentioned, more than 80% of patients with COVID-19 had mild symptoms 20 and a consistent part of them could not require hospitalization. Consequently, our estimates on upper airway symptoms could be biased as we found only studies describing hospitalized patients. In patients with mild symptoms, differential diagnosis should be addressed. In fact, pharyngodynia with or without fever could be the presenting symptom of other respiratory infections (eg, tonsillitis or epiglottitis). Nevertheless, it is important to inform otolaryngologists that sore throat and nasal congestion could be present in patients with COVID-19.Our review considered only hospitalized patients and this could influence the percentage of complaints.

        <p>Olfaction alterations remain an open issue. None of included reports considered smell reduction. On March 22, 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery stated that anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported by patients ultimately testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and proposed to add these symptoms to the list of screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection. 28 A first survey on olfactory and taste disorders was conducted on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Hospital Sacco (Milan, Italy) 29 but this report did not match inclusion criteria of the present review. Between 59 interviewed patients, 33.9% reported at least one taste or olfactory disorder and 18.6% reported both alterations. 29 Postviral anosmia was one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults, accounting for up to 40% cases of anosmia, 30 and it should not be a surprise if SARS-CoV-2 would also cause anosmia in infected patients. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 31 The human coronavirus 229E has already been isolated in nasal discharge from 1 patient with postviral olfactory dysfunction 32 ; SARS-CoV-2 exploited the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the cells, similar to SARS-CoV. 33 The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors that have been detected over glial cells and neurons. 33 According to these preliminary evidences, we believed that smell and taste disorders should be considered manifestations of COVID-19.Olfaction alterations remain an open issue. None of included reports considered smell reduction. On March 22, 2020, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery stated that anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported by patients ultimately testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and proposed to add these symptoms to the list of screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection. 28 A first survey on olfactory and taste disorders was conducted on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Hospital Sacco (Milan, Italy) 29 but this report did not match inclusion criteria of the present review. Between 59 interviewed patients, 33.9% reported at least one taste or olfactory disorder and 18.6% reported both alterations. 29 Postviral anosmia was one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults, accounting for up to 40% cases of anosmia, 30 and it should not be a surprise if SARS-CoV-2 would also cause anosmia in infected patients.

        <p>In our review, lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common. Many patients had also elevated C-reactive protein, lactose dehydrogenase, and D-dimer. Wang et al 11 considered fever, respiratory symptoms, and lymphopenia fundamental to identify suspected cases, 11 and the results of our review confirmed the importance of this parameter of blood cell count. In the present study, chest CT showed alterations in most of patients (83%) with frequent bilateral involvement (89.5%) and ground-glass opacity (50%). Similar to our findings, Ai et al 12 found ground-glass opacity in almost 46% of patients; the authors reported also consolidation in 50% of patients. Interestingly, Ai et al claimed that chest CT had higher sensitivity than RT-PCR assay: The reported positive rates of RT-PCR assay and chest CT imaging were 59% (601/ 1014) and 88% (888/1014) for the diagnosis of suspected patients with COVID-19.In our review, lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common.

        <p>There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, although different experimental treatments with antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ ritonavir; remdesivir) and interferon are being used. 34 Supportive treatments were frequently needed in our reviewed cases: Oxygen therapy (44.8%) and mechanical ventilation (noninvasive in 6.2% and invasive in 3.4%) were the most required. According to the large series from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of COVID-19 cases were severe (ie, dyspnea, respiratory frequency !30/min, blood oxygen saturation 93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24-48 hours), and 5% were critical (ie, respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure). 20 The overall mortality was 2.3%. 20 In our series, only 2 studies classified patients with severe COVID-19 but with different criteria. Guan et al 7 found 15.7% of severe cases, while Zhang et al 14 found 41%; this difference should be due to the different number of included pneumonia patients (79.1% vs 100%). 7,14 In our series, critical cases (ie, cases with complications) were 9%, and mortality was 2.4%, similarly to the larger series. 20 Most of reports agreed that severe cases were more frequent in older patients and in those with preexisting comorbid conditions (ie, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer). 7,8,13,20 It has to be underlined that total number of cases with COVID-19 is likely higher due to inherent difficulties in identifying and counting mild and asymptomatic case. This means that many suspected and clinically diagnosed cases are not yet counted. Consequently, mortality estimates could not be realistic at this stage.There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, although different experimental treatments with antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ ritonavir; remdesivir) and interferon are being used. 34 Supportive treatments were frequently needed in our reviewed cases: Oxygen therapy (44.8%) and mechanical ventilation (noninvasive in 6.2% and invasive in 3.4%) were the most required.

        <p>The main limitation of the present review was related to the low qualities of included evidences (all retrospective studies). Furthermore, we considered only hospitalized patients and this could not fully represent the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. We found no studies conducted by ENT specialists, and upper airway symptoms (eg, olfactory disorders) could have been underestimated.The main limitation of the present review was related to the low qualities of included evidences (all retrospective studies).

        <p>In conclusion, otolaryngologists should be aware that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, smell, and taste disorders could be presenting symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue but fever could be absent in a significant part of patients at initial presentation. Lymphopenia and bilateral alterations at chest CT were very common between patients with COVID-19 and could be helpful in identifying suspected cases.In conclusion, otolaryngologists should be aware that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, smell, and taste disorders could be presenting symptoms of COVID-19.
