        <p>A lmost 10% of pregnant women have hypertension; hypertension is preexisting in 1%, gestational hypertension without proteinuria develops in 5 to 6%, and preeclampsia develops in 2%. 1 Preexisting hypertension and gestational hypertension before 34 weeks are associated with an increased risk of perinatal and maternal complications. [2][3][4] Blood-pressure targets for women with nonsevere hypertension during pregnancy are much debated. Relevant randomized, controlled trials have been small and of moderate or poor quality; tight control (the use of antihypertensive therapy to normalize blood pressure) has been associated with maternal benefits (e.g., a decrease in the frequency of severe hypertension and possibly in the rate of antenatal hospitalization) 5,6 but sometimes, though not consistently, with perinatal risks (e.g., poor fetal growth and well-being). [7][8][9] International guidelines for nonsevere hypertension during pregnancy recommend treatment goals consistent with either less-tight control (blood pressure that is higher than normal but not severely elevated) or tight control. [10][11][12][13] The Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS) was designed to compare less-tight control with tight control of nonproteinuric, nonsevere hypertension in pregnancy with respect to perinatal and maternal outcomes.A lmost 10% of pregnant women have hypertension; hypertension is preexisting in 1%, gestational hypertension without proteinuria develops in 5 to 6%, and preeclampsia develops in 2%. 1 Preexisting hypertension and gestational hypertension before 34 weeks are associated with an increased risk of perinatal and maternal complications.

        <p>Women were included if they had nonsevere, nonproteinuric preexisting hypertension or gestational hypertension; a diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 105 mm Hg if they were not receiving antihypertensive therapy, or 85 to 105 mm Hg if they were receiving such treatment; and a live singleton fetus at 14 weeks 0 days to 33 weeks 6 days of gestation (determined in most cases by early pregnancy ultrasound examination). Preexisting hypertension was defined as diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher before pregnancy or before 20 weeks 0 days of gestation. Gestational hypertension was defined as diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher at 20 weeks or more of gestation. 14 Korotkoff phase V was used to determine diastolic blood pressure. Blood-pressure measurements were obtained by a health care professional at least 4 hours apart or at two consecutive outpatient visits, with the second measurement taken within 1 week before randomization. The values of both measurements were required to be elevated.Women were included if they had nonsevere, nonproteinuric preexisting hypertension or gestational hypertension; a diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 105 mm Hg if they were not receiving antihypertensive therapy, or 85 to 105 mm Hg if they were receiving such treatment; and a live singleton fetus at 14 weeks 0 days to 33 weeks 6 days of gestation (determined in most cases by early pregnancy ultrasound examination).

        <p>Randomization, which was stratified according to center and type of hypertension (preexisting or gestational), was performed in permuted blocks of random size (2 or 4) by site coordinators at a central site, with the use of a toll-free telephone line (Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research, University of Toronto) that was accessible 24 hours a day and backed up by a pager system.

        <p>Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to less-tight control (target diastolic blood pressure, 100 mm Hg) (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) or tight control (target diastolic blood pressure, 85 mm Hg) (Fig. S1B in the Supplementary Appendix) until delivery, with the goal of a between-group difference in diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg, a difference that was similar to that achieved in our pilot trial. 9 We anticipated that the average diastolic blood pressure in the less-tight-control group would be below 100 mm Hg and that the between-group difference in diastolic blood pressure would be less than 15 mm Hg, because most women who have hypertension without coexisting conditions have mild hypertension and would remain off antihypertensive medication after randomization. The study protocol recommended labetalol as the drug of first choice. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, direct renin inhibitors, and atenolol were not permitted before delivery. 14,16 No antihypertensive drugs were provided by the study.Eligible women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to less-tight control (target diastolic blood pressure, 100 mm Hg) (Fig. S1A in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) or tight control (target diastolic blood pressure, 85 mm Hg) (Fig. S1B in the Supplementary Appendix) until delivery, with the goal of a between-group difference in diastolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg, a difference that was similar to that achieved in our pilot trial. 9 We anticipated that the average diastolic blood pressure in the less-tight-control group would be below 100 mm Hg and that the between-group difference in diastolic blood pressure would be less than 15 mm Hg, because most women who have hypertension without coexisting conditions have mild hypertension and would remain off antihypertensive medication after randomization.

        <p>Standardized measurement of blood pressure was performed in outpatient settings by health professionals who obtained three blood-pressure measurements. The average of the second and third diastolic blood-pressure measurements was considered to be the diastolic blood pressure for that visit 17 ; this information was recorded in a patient-held diary, where potential cointerventions (e.g., clinic visits and fetal ultrasound examinations) were also recorded.Standardized measurement of blood pressure was performed in outpatient settings by health professionals who obtained three blood-pressure measurements.

        <p>Women were seen by their maternity care provider within 4 weeks after randomization, at which time adherence to the recommended algorithm (i.e., actions taken to achieve a target diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 104 mm Hg or 81 to 85 mm Hg) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and "clinically reasonable" adherence (i.e., actions taken to achieve a diastolic blood pressure 5 mm Hg above or below the target value of 100 mm Hg or 85 mm Hg) were evaluated (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Thereafter, women were seen according to a schedule determined by their maternity care provider. Data on blood-pressure measurements and cointerventions were collected from the patients' diaries during meetings (in person or by phone) with the site coordinator (at 14 to 20, 21 to 28, 29 to 33, and 34 to 40 weeks of gestation and at delivery). Outcome data were obtained from maternal and infant charts. At or after 6 weeks post partum and when the baby was at least 36 weeks of corrected postgestational age, a standardized maternal questionnaire was administered once (in person or by phone) by site coordinators to identify postdischarge maternal or neonatal complications.Women were seen by their maternity care provider within 4 weeks after randomization, at which time adherence to the recommended algorithm (i.e., actions taken to achieve a target diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 104 mm Hg or 81 to 85 mm Hg) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) and "clinically reasonable" adherence (i.e., actions taken to achieve a diastolic blood pressure 5 mm Hg above or below the target value of 100 mm Hg or 85 mm Hg) were evaluated (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

        <p>The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy loss (defined as miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy termination, stillbirth, or neonatal death) or high-level neonatal care (defined as greater-than-normal newborn care) for more than 48 hours until 28 days of life or until discharge home, whichever was later. The secondary outcome was serious maternal complications occurring up to 6 weeks post partum or until hospital discharge, whichever was later. Serious maternal complications included death, stroke, eclampsia, blindness, uncontrolled hypertension, the use of inotropic agents, pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, myocardial ischemia or infarction, hepatic dysfunction, hepatic hematoma or rupture, renal failure, and transfusion 18 (see Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix for all definitions). The primary and secondary outcomes were adjudicated centrally by an expert committee whose members were unaware of the group assignments and were not involved in the care of patients in the cases under review. Other outcomes included components of the primary and secondary outcomes, measures of fetal growth and newborn complications, and severe hypertension (≥160/110 mm Hg) in the mother.The primary outcome was a composite of pregnancy loss (defined as miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy termination, stillbirth, or neonatal death) or high-level neonatal care (defined as greater-than-normal newborn care) for more than 48 hours until 28 days of life or until discharge home, whichever was later.

        <p>We estimated that with a sample size of 514 per group, the study would have 80% power, at a two-tailed alpha level of 0.05, assuming primary outcome rates of 33% in the tight-control group and 25% in the less-tight-control group, a 10% rate of crossover, a 1% loss to follow-up, and two interim analyses, 9 as calculated with the chisquare test with the use of East software (

        <p>The primary outcome and all dichotomous outcomes were analyzed with the use of a mixedeffects logistic-regression model, with adjustment for the stratification factors, the use of any antihypertensive therapy at the time of randomization, prerandomization blood pressure of 160/110 mm Hg or higher during this pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and any factor with apparent dissimilarity between the groups at baseline. 19 The alpha level was set at 0.046 for the primary outcome, on the basis of the Lan-DeMets spending function with O'Brien-Fleming-type boundaries and two interim analyses (with P&lt;0.0002 and P&lt;0.012 used as guidelines by the data and safety monitoring board at the Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research for the consideration of early termination of the trial at the first and second interim analyses, respectively). To accommodate the many comparisons made, two-tailed P values of less than 0.01 for the secondary outcomes and less than 0.001 for other outcomes were considered to indicate statistical significance. Exploratory analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes, birth weight less than the 10th percentile, 20 severe hypertension, and preeclampsia included interactions between treatment and five prognostic factors from the adjusted logisticregression model, the perinatal mortality ratio of the recruiting country, and clinically reasonable adherence; for these exploratory analyses, the Breslow-Day test of homogeneity was used and P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.The primary outcome and all dichotomous outcomes were analyzed with the use of a mixedeffects logistic-regression model, with adjustment for the stratification factors, the use of any antihypertensive therapy at the time of randomization, prerandomization blood pressure of 160/110 mm Hg or higher during this pregnancy, gestational diabetes, and any factor with apparent dissimilarity between the groups at baseline. 19 The alpha level was set at 0.046 for the primary outcome, on the basis of the Lan-DeMets spending function with O'Brien-Fleming-type boundaries and two interim analyses (with P&lt;0.0002 and P&lt;0.012 used as guidelines by the data and safety monitoring board at the Centre for Mother, Infant, and Child Research for the consideration of early termination of the trial at the first and second interim analyses, respectively).

        <p>Among 111 active sites, 95 sites in 16 countries enrolled at least one woman (1030 recruits from March 26, 2009, to August 2, 2012). A total of 519 women were randomly assigned to less-tight control and 511 to tight control of diastolic blood pressure. One site (in which 43 women were enrolled) was excluded before the analyses on the advice of the CHIPS steering committee and the data and safety monitoring board owing to concerns about informed consent and data integrity. At the remaining 94 sites, the median number of annual deliveries was 3700 (interquartile range, 2650 to 5000).

        <p>This randomized trial showed that less-tight control of maternal hypertension in pregnancy as compared with tight control resulted in no significant difference in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, as assessed by the rates of perinatal death or high-level neonatal care for more than 48 hours (our primary outcome). On the basis of the 95% confidence interval around the risk estimate and an event rate of 30.4% in the tightcontrol group, the results are compatible with no more than a 5.2 percentage-point decrease or 6.6 percentage-point increase in the rate of the primary outcome with less-tight as compared with tight control. Less-tight (vs. tight) control did not significantly increase the risk of overall serious maternal complications (our secondary outcome), although our findings are compatible with anywhere from a 0.7 percentage-point decrease to a 4.0 percentage-point increase in the rate of this outcome. Less-tight control was associated with a higher risk of severe maternal hypertension than was tight control. Although less-tight control was also associated with a higher risk of a platelet count less than 100×10 9 per liter and elevated liverenzyme levels in association with symptoms, the P values for these associations did not reach the prespecified level of significance for "other outcomes."This randomized trial showed that less-tight control of maternal hypertension in pregnancy as compared with tight control resulted in no significant difference in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, as assessed by the rates of perinatal death or high-level neonatal care for more than 48 hours (our primary outcome).

        <p>Our trial is substantially larger than previous trials that have examined the effects of lower versus higher blood-pressure targets during pregnancy (with previous trials having randomly assigned women to antihypertensive therapy or placebo or no treatment). 5 With respect to the mothers, our findings are consistent with a metaanalysis of previous trials (29 trials involving 3350 women) that showed that less-tight versus tight control increases the incidence of severe maternal hypertension (but not preeclampsia). 5 Severe hypertension is a risk factor for acute stroke during and outside of pregnancy. 15,21 The rates of severe hypertension were higher in the current study than in some previous trials (in which the rate was approximately 20% in the placebo or no-therapy group), 5 even though almost half the women in CHIPS performed blood-pressure moni-toring at home. CHIPS may have identified women with true hypertension; the rates of severe hypertension were consistent with those in trials that recruited women with hypertension early in the second trimester, when blood pressure during pregnancy is lowest. 6,9 Meta-analyses of previous randomized, controlled trials have suggested that lower blood pressure (achieved with the use of antihypertensive therapy) versus higher blood pressure may result in lower birth weight and a heightened risk of small-for-gestational-age newborns. 7,8 In contrast, another meta-analysis of randomized, The New England Journal of Medicine Downloaded from nejm.org by Jim Thornton on February 18, 2016.

        <p>controlled trials involving pregnant women showed that tight control with beta-blockers (including labetalol) was associated with fewer neonatal respiratory complications, but this was subject to potential publication bias. 16 Our findings of no significant between-group differences in the primary or other perinatal outcomes do not support these potential benefits or risks of less-tight versus tight control. Before the start of the trial, the target difference in blood pressure was 5 mm Hg. We achieved mean differences of 5.8 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 4.6 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure, differences that were consistent with those achieved in trials involving nonpregnant participants in which lower versus "standard" targets were evaluated. 22 A limitation of our trial was that we included women with either preexisting or gestational hypertension, but results for the primary and secondary outcomes were similar for each hypertension type. Our primary and secondary outcomes included some causes of pregnancy loss (miscarriage and elective termination) and some interventions for high-level neonatal care that were not expected to be associated with maternal bloodpressure control; however, these causes and interventions (including no ectopic pregnancies in either group) were infrequent and were balanced between the groups. Although labetalol was considered to be the antihypertensive agent of choice in this study, it was used by only two thirds of the women who received antihypertensive medication after randomization. We did not collect information on common adverse effects of antihypertensive medications, but few women had medication adjusted for reasons other than blood-pressure control. In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of antihypertensive therapy in pregnancy, only 3.4% of women treated with antihypertensive agents changed drugs because of maternal side effects. 5 In summary, we found no significant differences in the rates of major adverse perinatal outcomes or overall serious maternal complications in association with less-tight versus tight control of blood pressure.
